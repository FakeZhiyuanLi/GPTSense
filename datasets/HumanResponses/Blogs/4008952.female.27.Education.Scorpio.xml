      I totally wiped out today. I was taking old posters off the wall in the band room. To reach the higher posters, I had to stand on the table. As I was stepping down, I missed the chair and crashed right to the floor. I was headed towards the pit and was about to tumble down the steps when I caught myself. All of a sudden I hear a roar of laughter. The classroom across the hall saw everything! Don’t ask me why they were facing out the door instead of the front of the room. As I start to get up, my knee is killing me! Apparently I bonked it on a chair on my way down.  So I recover, no harm done, go ahead and laugh at me, I’m cool. Until I try to bend my leg… ow! Right where I bumped my leg, it has swollen up to the size of a small doughnut (mmm, doughnut.) So I’m sure in a few days, I’ll have a big purple splotch on my leg. Lovely.  Everyone was crashing today. During band, two different kids wiped out… one was holding a bass drum at the time and it went flying! I felt so bad for her today.&nbsp;Katrina is a sweetheart, but certain people always pick on her. When she wiped out, all the kids started giving her crap for dropping the drum and teasing her. No one asked if she was okay. That’s just rude, plain and simple. Then during percussion sectionals, she realized her cymbals were locked in the gym (for graduation practice.) She says she can’t get her cymbals because it’s locked and two other kids start imitating her “Oh poor me, I don’t have any cymbals,” etc. They continue to taunt her, even as they’re playing the cadence and marching. Give her a rest guys! These kids remind me of kids I knew in junior high. Thinking they’re better than others, and for no good reason.  My headache finally went away! I started to get a migraine during band. I usually get them at least once a month. So I pop a “happy pill” and wait for it to kick in. I know it’s working when my forehead starts to tingle, my nose gets cold, my face gets really warm, and I feel like I have to sneeze. My nose got cold, but that’s about it. So I eat my lunch, and I’m famished! I’m usually not that hungry around lunch, but today I was. After I ate my breadsticks, I was craving chips. So I ate some Doritos… then a candy bar. All my food was tasting really good. Then one of my students joked that I had the munchies (because of my meds.) I think I did! That’s so funny!  After lunch duty, I still had a headache so I rested on the couch for a while. (For those of you who don’t know, we have a couch in the band room.) I closed my eyes and I felt like I was tripping! I was seeing all these strange visuals and I was really enjoying it. Of course, a student had to interrupt my trip to ask a question. How rude, haha!  So, today was the seniors’ last day. It really hasn’t sunk in yet. Maybe because I’ll see them all at Graduation and they’re playing for Memorial Day and Rodeo Parade too. I got out the seniors’ Christmas ornaments and was looking at them. Remember the senior student who dropped band? I decided that his ornament doesn’t get to stay because he dropped the class. So for the next 10 minutes, some boys and I played baseball with the ornament and the toy scepter the kids got me for Christmas. Good times, good times!  Hmmm, the swelling has gone down in my leg, yay!

      Today was pretty uneventful for me, so I'll again post a sample from someone else's blog. This is from my one of my students, Sara:   Tuesday night was our concert, I was pretty nervous. First was the choir, that went well. (The choir director) was dressed very plainly, but, she skill looked nice. Then I raced to put my flute together and change into my swing-choir dress. When we performed I made a few mistake none were really that noticeable, except when I spun the wrong way. Last was band. I put my flute to my mouth at the beginning of a song, but the flutes don't play there! I concentrated hard for the rest of the performance. We sounded really good! Our cool Band Director Miss H. was dressed stylishly, and gave out the awards. I know I'll never get one. Then she promtly yelled at&nbsp;Darryl to shut up. Thursday the only thing that happened was my little sisters' concert. BORING. The only highlight was talking to my friends and Miss H. Miss She is a really nice person. I am annoying, I don't want to be, but I am. She is really nice. She's pretty, and funny, and everything I want to be. She's happy with who she is and I hope when I'm older I can be more like her. She's one of my role-models.

      This morning, I had another rehearsal with the Wausau Band that&nbsp;I’m going on tour with. We had a rehearsal last Monday too. Now, for both rehearsals I have left pissed off. The reason? I hate it when people think that any moron can play percussion. For our tour, we didn’t have enough percussionists, so someone decided to throw these three non-percussionists into the section. One is a high school trumpet player, one is a teacher who doesn’t know how to read music. The other one, I don’t know her story, but she seems to think she has some abilities when in fact, she clearly has none.   On Monday, we gave these three people easy parts. A cymbal roll here, a gong hit there. The HS kid was standing next to me and I was watching his cymbal part go by as he stood there drooling. So I start playing his part to show him how it goes. Then I say, “You try it now.” The kid has no idea where the beat is, doesn’t know how to hit the cymbal, just basically sucking all over. I couldn’t take it! I took his mallets away from him and said, “You’re done,” and I played the rest of his part for him. Today, same song, I decide to give him another chance. This kid is freaking retarded! I’m taking his part away permanently. I don’t want percussion to suck.   This other lady, she’s another case altogether. She keeps saying she can take on harder parts. We give her a crash cymbal part today. Every time she’s supposed to crash, she moves her arms as though she was crashing, yet I hear nothing. She does this repeatedly. Is she playing air cymbals? Not a fricken sound comes out of those cymbals! In fact, throughout the whole rehearsal, I don’t hear a note from her. She stands at the bells, she holds the cymbals, she just doesn’t play. I want to push her down and take her music away!   Seriously, I would rather have 5 sticks in my hands and try to cover all the parts myself than have someone who is incompetent try to play percussion. It does take musical skill and technique to play percussion!! I don’t know what I’m going to do at the next rehearsal. If these non-percussionists don’t get better, I am taking their parts away for good and I will play them myself. I am a teacher 5 days a week. I don’t want to have to take my practice time and teach them how to play. This is a professional group. Take some lessons if you need to, just stop wasting my time.   By the way, my xylophone solo is flying along. I’ve actually managed to get it up to tempo and it’s memorized. My only concern is my nerves. When my hands shake, I tighten up spazz all over. I just have to relax and play the music.   ANOTHER RANT: I can’t get MTV in this town. It sucks. It sucks ass. I am totally addicted to the Real World and Road Rules. Since my parents get MTV at their house, I’ve been setting up a VCR and taping the shows. Then, when I come home to visit, I put in a new tape and take the full tape home. So I should have 6 hours of Real World/Road Rules. Well, somehow I must’ve messed up when setting the timer on the VCR. I just tried watching my tape and it is full of shit shows like Punked, Pimp My Ride, and I Want a Famous Face. On the one tape, I have the episode of I Want a Famous Face where the cross dresser wants to look like Jennifer Lopez. It’s on there three times! Is MTV programming really that retarded or am I not able to function a VCR properly? Maybe a little of both. So now I’m pissed because I’ve missed a month’s worth of my shows.   On to another subject… Last Tuesday, my band had their final concert of the year. It was a great concert with lots of musical things happening. We had a few squeaks and fracks, but I was very pleased with their end result. After the concert, we got yet another standing ovation! That’s 3 for 3. As I was standing on the stage after our last song, I felt someone come up from behind and give me a big hug. I couldn’t turn around to see, but then I saw one of my seniors, Ehren,&nbsp;walking towards me. He joins in and gives me a hug too. When I see&nbsp;Amanda coming too, I realize that my three seniors are all giving me a group hug (it was Jake behind me.) The three kids are all squeezing me and the crowd is taking tons of pictures. Me, I was smiling from ear to ear! The three of them hugging me was better than any gift I could’ve received. I really felt appreciated and I was glad the audience could see that my students appreciated me too.   A few days after the concert, I receive an email from a former band mom. She said that this year’s concerts have been the best she’s ever heard, all due to my skills. It means so much to me to hear from a parent. I’ve saved every email I’ve ever gotten and I plan to whip them out of the school board ever tries to cut my position. Actually, I’m pretty sure that if my job was ever in jeopardy, I’d have the support of the community and students behind me. This community has been so supportive and complimentary to me since I started working here. I feel like I’m really making an impact on the band here.

      Today during David's lesson, I just lost it! Things were going fine and then I had an out of body experience. You know what started it? I had a pencil stuck in my hair! That’s it! I realized I had two pencils with me and I just started giggling uncontrollably! Immediately tears started rolling down my face…&nbsp;David and Ehren were laughing so hard at me! Then I reach out and bumped my dead broken porcelain frog… and it made me cry/laugh even harder! I seriously don’t know what happened! I think I just needed to release some pent up emotion.

      I've been working on setting up my new computer since around 9:30 this morning, and have basically been going since. I'm hungry, but I don't want to stop to eat. This is my first connection to the internet with my new computer, so I had to celebrate with a blog entry, YAY!  Are you wondering why I'm home on a weekday? I took the day off to do my computer stuff. Is that sad? Maybe, but I needed a break anyway. On Monday, I tried playing my sandwich like a musical instrument. Yeeees, I needed a break from school!  I have so much stuff to write about, but it'll have to wait. I've got other stuff to do and I'm going&nbsp;to see  The Phantom of the Opera &nbsp;tonight.

      I’ve been saving this story since Friday night, so here goes. On my way driving home to my parents’ house, I give them all call to see if I should pick up some dinner. They say, “Let’s meet at Country Kitchen.” Yay! Yummy food! So I get there shortly and have to wait about 20 minutes for my parents to arrive, even though they only live 10 minutes away. So as I’m waiting, this waiter, Brian,&nbsp;comes over to keep me company. We talk a little bit, he asks my name, yadda yadda. But the thing is, he keeps touching me. He’ll reach out and grab my elbow, touch my shoulder. Um buddy, you don’t know me. Stop touching me. Finally my parents arrive and we are seated. Guess who our waiter is? Brian, the touchy feely waiter. He walks up, sees me, and goes “Hello Niiki.&nbsp; So good to see you again!”   Okay, I’m starting to realize this story won’t be interesting to anyone out there reading, but I’m going to keep going anyway…  So over the length of the night, whenever Brian comes over to the table, he gets down and squats next to me, won’t even look at my parents, will only talk to me. He’s still touching me and now he’s started to wink. I should be flattered that someone is actually flirting with me, but I think it’s creepy when it’s done in front of my parents. So anytime my parents needed a drink refill, they gave their cup to me, because Brian was ignoring them anyway, and he checked up on me every 5 minutes. At the end of the meal as my parents are paying, I try to sneak out the door. No luck, Brian gleefully shouts out to me, “Goodbye&nbsp;Niiki! Bye Niiki!&nbsp; (yes, he said it twice) Hope to see you again!” Seriously, what the…?  So Saturday I went rummage sale-ing with my mom. I love rummage sales! Other people’s crap are my treasures. The best buy of the day was a rose tree/decorative thing for 50 cents. But my real treasure was found in a free box. There was this dirty toy saxophone. I was hesitant to even touch it, because it was gross looking. But, it’s a saxophone and it’s free, I’ll take it. So I took it home and gave it a bath. While cleaning it, I realized that it’s a bubble blower too! When you blow into it, it makes sound AND blows bubbles… whoa. Imagine all the fun I can have with that!  After I left my parents’ house today, I went grocery shopping. And guess what I bought?! Those damn chicken strips I have been craving for about a month. For those of you asking me, what chicken strips? Swanson makes these amazing beer battered chicken strip meal that comes with cheesy potato wedges. So good! It’s part of their “sports” line or something like that. Even thought I could give a crap about sports, these chicken strips are to die for. They are almost as good as the chicken flippers at the Hilltop restaurant. I even had them for dinner tonight, yum!  So I’m starting to get stressed about&nbsp;the China&nbsp;tour. All of a sudden, I’m realizing I don’t know what to bring there, how the luggage situation at the airport works, I don’t know the language or customs, etc. I just got my luggage today and that sort of jump-started everything. I haven’t really been thinking about the trip, because I’m focusing on school. But I leave only one week after school is out, so I’d better start thinking about it! I have a rehearsal tomorrow night, so hopefully that will start my brain in motion. The other band director I work with is going too, so at least I have someone to latch on to. She doesn’t know anyone in the group, so she’s nervous about that. I just hope she doesn’t get annoying, since I’ll be with her for two weeks. I was supposed to have a good friend of mine come to China with me, but he balked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Jon!  I got into an argument with my dad about my trip. I’m driving to the place I’m meeting the bus and leaving my car there, so I will have my keys with me. He wants me to carry my keys around for two weeks and I want to leave them in my suitcase at the motel. His logic is, “What if someone breaks into your hotel room and steals your keys?” If someone breaks into my hotel room, I have bigger issues like clothes and money to worry about. Isn’t that a totally stupid argument? When I told my dad that I would leave my keys in the room, he threw a fit and walked out saying “I’m not having this conversation.” Seriously, my dad is so full of drama. And I’m even more sorry to say, that’s where I got it from! We have arguments about the stupidest stuff. That’s why I try not to go home more than once a month.  Did anyone make it reading this far? You did? YAY! (I’ve become very aware of how much I say YAY. But as my mom said to me, it’s better than saying “Oh fuck it all.” My mom is hilarious!)

      Grrr! I rushed home from school today because my computer was going to be delivered sometime after 4:00. I get home, check my messages and there is a message from the delivery man. "Hi Miss&nbsp;HaKAYla (pronounced wrong, can anyone ever get my name right?)this is Phil from Federal Express. It's 12:20 and I should be in your town in about 20 minutes. Please give me a call if you're home so I can deliver your packages." Well, I wasn't home so guess what? No computer for me!  Now I have to wait until Tuesday to get my computer (they don't deliver on Mondays, how dumb.) At least now they will deliver it to school so I will be guaranteed to get it. So from the day I order my computer to the day I receive it is 16 days. That's nuts. If I hadn't gotten this computer up and running, that's 16 days without a functioning computer and most importantly, the internet. Viruses suck ass.  Well, that's all I really have to say today. I could write more if I had the time, but I'm getting ready to visit my folks for the weekend. I haven't been home in over a month and I missed Mother's Day. I have to spend some quality time with my parents. Oh, and of course do my laundry! Maybe on my way through the big town, I'll pick up some of those yummy chicken strips I have been craving for weeks now. Yay!

       After school, I practiced my solo for the China tour. I sucked ass today though. Couldn’t get my hands to speed up. I also was having control issues, couldn’t get my hands to line up. I guess this is what happens when you go from practicing 3 hours a day to practicing a few times a month. I have lost lots of skill. But the weeks leading up to the tour, I will be practicing my butt off.   When I write here, I feel like I’m writing to a friend. Only this friend doesn’t interrupt me or zone out when I’m talking. Okay, maybe you did zone out, but this way I didn’t know! Uninterrupted time to think and release. How pleasant.

      Okay, my house (or should I say apartment) is hot! My cheeks are all flushed and I just put on shorts. You know I’m warm if I’m wearing shorts! It’s always a scary time of year when I have to bring out my big, white legs. Ugh.  Guess what I found in my apartment today? A SPIDER!!!!!!!! For those of you who don’t know, spiders terrify me. My last apartment was surrounded by them. You could often find me outside emptying entire cans of Raid against the side of my apartment. I was pretty damn lucky, in that none ever got inside. The most terrifying time was when I discovered the huge spiders that hung above my doorway. The overhang was about 10 feet up, so I couldn’t reach them with the Raid. So, I would get about 5 feet from my door, take a look up (why did I look up? It always made me scared) and take a big breath. Then, I would run as fast as I could to the door, fling it open and slam it behind me. My neighbors must have thought I was crazy!  So then I move here and the first thing I did was check my porch for spiders. A few small ones, I can handle that. I, of course, Raided them. So a few hours later I’m in my guest bedroom/office and I open my window shade. HOLY SHIT, there is the biggest spider I have ever seen in my life hanging outside my window!!! I immediately closed my shades and ran into my living room, as if somehow this spider would eat it’s way through the window and come get me. I was shaking so bad and I was scared to go into the room.   So, I obviously couldn’t sleep that night. I kept waking up and checking to see if anything was crawling on me. The next day after school, I drove to the nearest town just for a can of HEAVY DUTY RAID, the kind that shoots over 20 feet. When I get home, I find the courage to open my window and take a picture of that bitch. I needed proof to email my friends and family. That sucker was as big as a quarter! After taking the picture, I go outside.  Standing a good 10 feet from the side of the building, I start shooting at the spider. I felt like I was playing that carnival game where you have to shoot the water into the clown’s mouth to make the balloon blow up and explode. Except I was shooting the raid at the huge spider. I made contact… I kept spraying… that buggers not giving up! Keep going, don’t stop… he’s falling… dangit, he has a string guiding him down, why can’t he just fall down and die? Finally he guides to the ground where I stand above him and spray directly on him for about a minute. This thing is coated, he’s not going anywhere! My can is almost empty. I look at the side of the building and all the windows have this thick layer of poison on them. Oh well, it’ll rain soon enough.  The next day, I went to check on the spider. He was all dried up from sitting in the sun all day. YES! I AM SUPERWOMAN, DEFEATER OF NASTY SPIDERS!  Did I mention that I am terrified of spiders?  Oh, back to my original sentence… today I found a spider in my apartment. I whipped out my vacuum cleaner and sucked that baby up. Hmmm, I guess that story isn’t as good as the last one.  Ah, my apartment is much cooler now. Right before I started my spider rant, I opened up all my windows. Now it’s actually a little cold in here. Now I should shut them.

      Let’s see, did anything exciting happen at school today? Before school, a student meowed at me, then I went to the teachers’ lounge and gossiped with the teachers. I hardly ever partake in this kind of activity, but I had nothing else to do that morning. Let’s just say the conversation revolved around a student and his huge erection. Let’s see, once school got rolling, I read a newspaper, got into a conversation about plagiarism with some kids, taught two lessons, band rehearsal.   We did Jazz Band today and the kids actually played really well. I always dread Jazz days, because the kids complain so badly! Keep in mind, Jazz Band is a voluntary activity. But there was little complaining today and the kids played with some OOMPH! I think the attitude of the band had something to do with the kids who were absent today.   Two more lessons. Not much really exciting happening. My lunch… I had these yummy little pancakes and sausages, mmm! I talked with&nbsp;David while&nbsp;Peder serenaded us the entire time with the Hallelujah Chorus. Lunch duty… I spent about 10 minutes watching kids type in their lunch numbers. I had to take away a girl’s lunch because she was $35 in the hole. Pay up next time! Don’t cross the lunch ladies! Then I yelled at some kids for being in the hallway.  Taught two lessons, taught two lessons. I will once in awhile lock the band room to keep the riff-raff out, but some kids managed to sneak in. It was also during this hour that a strong musician of mine told me of a class conflict with next year. Band conflicted with a class she needed to graduate. I love when this happens. I should’ve had about 3 more seniors this year, but they all had class conflicts. Anyway, we go down to guidance and do some plea-bargaining. She will come to band 3 days a week, and go to the other class 2 days a week. She’s an awesome player, this won’t be an issue.   Taught three lessons, instead of the usual two… whoa, try to calm down, yay! After school, taught another lesson. Why was my day so busy? And you know what? I totally didn’t realize just how busy my day was until I wrote it right here. I should be more tired.

      Eh, I'm tired. Not much going on these days. I worked the track meet at school tonight. I was doing shot put, and after every throw, I'm supposed to yell "mark." One time, I almost yelled out "mark time." Does anyone know why this is funny/stupid? Because the only person who would yell out "mark time" is a drill sargeant. Or a band director.   One of the shot putters bought me a snow cone afterward, yay!   So I have this catalog called "The Music Stand." It has all kinds of gift items for musicians, dancers, actors, etc. I love it! You can't find this kind of stuff anywhere! So, I'm putting in an order tonight. I really should be saving my money (gas prices or so fricken high, I think I'm going to be stuck in this town all summer!)    ADD moment ... I'm not going to be here all summer, I'm going to on a musical tour for two weeks in June. I'm performing with a group I used to play with where I formerly lived. I'm a featured soloist too. I'm performing "Rainbow Ripples" for solo xylophone and band. I'm terrified of messing up! Everyone will think I suck.    ADD moment over ... as I was saying, there is this awesome catalog. I'm buying $156.13 worth of stuff! Including $80 worth of framed art. Okay, to an art collector that is chump change. But for someone who just recently grew out of sticking posters in the walls with tacks, this is a pretty hefty investment! Ah, who am I kidding? The room I'm siting in right now has three posters with tacks. But my living room, ah so pretty. So grown up.   I think that's all I'll say for today. I'm pretty tired, so my mind can't seem to settle on one topic. I almost went on a rant about ADD and dyslexia, but I think I'll save that for another day.

      Man, today was such an eventful day! I took my band to large group contest. When it comes time to perform, my kids are fabulous! They were so musical, so intense. I was beaming with pride! After our performance, one of the judges comes up and goes on and on about what a wonderful little band they are, how they played so musically and exciting. Then she said that the kids were taught really well. (Yeah! GO ME, GO ME!) At this point, all the kids are on a natural high, as am I.  As we're getting ready to go home,&nbsp;the Wittenberg band&nbsp;director comes to me, puts her arm around me and says "You were robbed." I just looked at her, dumbfounded. "No, you're kidding, we didn't get a 1?" Apparently, two of the three judges gave my band a 2. I was shocked. Then&nbsp;the Bowler&nbsp;band director comes up to me and says the exact same thing. "YOU WERE ROBBED." The&nbsp;Wittenberg director said that this was the best this school’s band has ever sounded. The&nbsp;Bowler director said that in his opinion, my band had the most musical performance of the day. Keep in mind, my band is a class B band. We were more musical than the class A bands. The final straw was when one of the judges comes up to me and says, get this, "You were robbed." Now that's three different people who said the exact same thing to me! The female judge (the one who said I was robbed) was the only judge to give my band a 1st rating.  Okay, so I get the displeasure of getting on my bus to tell my kids the results. Only, when I get on the bus, they already know. I got to do a big pep talk and try to convince the kids that I'm proud of them and no not let this get them down. Most of the kids are angry at the judges. But my first chair trumpet player&nbsp;was so upset, he refused to talk to anyone on the entire ride home. I tried talking to him and he wouldn't even acknowledge my presence. This student lives for band. He practices every night and is a sweetheart of a boy. I was seriously worried that he was going to go home and hurt himself because he was so upset.   Oh, rewind. I forgot to mention that&nbsp; the Bowler band director is going to write a letter of complaint to the people in charge about the rating my band got. He is also going to write a letter to the superintendent of my school district to let them know what a fabulous job I did with the kids and that he was beyond impressed.   So, was today a good or a bad day? It should've been a high point of my career. I've never been prouder as a band director as I was today. I loved my kids' performance! But that stupid 2 rating stabbed all of us in the heart.   I can say that many times, my band has deserved what we got. At Solo & Ensemble contest, we deserved every 2 we got. We were doing class A ensembles that were over our head. But I came down to reality for this performance and entered the band as a class B ensemble. And we still got a 2? What, should we enter class C next year and compete with beginning junior high bands? That's BULL.  The more I write, the more upset I get. I'm furious, I'm sad. It's only one day in the life of these kids, but they really deserved better. I want them to finally get their reward for all the hard work they do for me in class. In my eyes, they are all superstars!!!!!!!  Now, let’s hear about this day through the eyes of one of my students, David:   Sat, 8 May 2004   Shaft! Can ya' dig it?   I can't!    &nbsp;  Today I had to do a large group ensemble thing for band. It was like an hour away. Anyway, we (HS band)performed at this thing. And we rocked the building! We sounded awesome! I mean "Holy crap! That can't be us!" awesome! We played our three songs like we had been playing them forever!     &nbsp;  At these events one of three judges always approaches when you're done to critique you. We had the lady. She said we were awesome, and that we sounded excellent. She also said that we followed the direction of our teacher, Ms. H. wonderfully. And that even on the fly, while she (the judge) drilled us we could follow the tempo changes she was giving.     &nbsp;  Then the three judges' scores were posted the lady gave us a 1, the two old dicks both gave us 2s. Which gave us a second.     &nbsp;  These guys were expecting music to come from instruments we don't even have. Our band consists of less than 30 students. We have 1 trombone, 1 baritone, 3 alto saxes, 2 tenor saxes, 1 bari sax, 7 clarinets, 6 flutes, 3 trumpets, and 5 or so percussionists. For some of these songs as our critiquer said "Everyone has solos".     &nbsp;  We were shafted. Two band teachers said that we got robbed. Last year we got a 1st in the same division, and we were not nearly this good. From what I have gathered the other two teachers that said we got robbed said that they would write letters to complain.     &nbsp;  Those old bastards are such blatent bullshi**ers. I am so pissed!     &nbsp;  Write a letter to the people in charge and tell them to get these guys gone! We deserve a recount! Recall the damn votes! Let's try again!

      So, today was just another day in the life of me. Went to school, did my job, yadda yadda. I wish I knew how to post pictures here. I took some good ones today. I like to take quite a few pictures at work.   This Saturday, my band is performing at Large Group contest. We played through our songs today... the best we've ever done them! We are so ready. I'm so incredibly proud of my little band. The previous school I worked at, Marathon HS, I had a large, talented band. Unfortunately, the band was full of snobby little brats. I hardly got anything accomplished with these kids the entire year I was there. It's a totally different story at where I work now. The group was pretty rough when I arrived in September. I remember thinking "Oh Lord, what have I gotten myself in to?" But these kids are so great, and they really work with me well. I've seen tremendous growth in my students, and I love them all. Okay, that's a lie. There are a few I'd like to whip a rock at, but the majority are wonderful kids.   Let's see, what else happened today? Um, I got a free t-shirt because it's teacher appreciation week... went to the grocery store because I was craving these frozen chicken finger meal thingies, and they didn't have them, GRR! That's one of the problems with a small town.   Speaking of teacher appreciation week, this past Monday&nbsp;Ehren and Kristin&nbsp;invited me over to their house for a grill out. That was so awesome! Yummy food, good company. After we ate, my students and I ended up walking around town for a few hours. That's right, I GOT SOME EXERCISE! It was so nice out, was a pleasant day.   Well, I guess I should end this entry here. Have to save something for future days, ha ha! You know what? I really enjoy writing here. I feel like I have someone to talk to, even if no one's listening. Is anyone out there reading this? Eh, does it really matter?

      Whoa... I have my very own blog. This is something I've wanted to do for awhile now. At first I was a little hesitant to publish my thoughts for the world to read, but I figure it might be somewhat theraputic. I live alone, don't have any friends where I live, so I need to talk to someone!   As you will probably eventually figure out (from reading my entries), I am a high school band teacher. I have so many stories of things that happen at school that no one probably wants to hear about. But you know what? You're reading my blog! You are voluntarily reading my stories! So shut your mouth and just listen.   Do&nbsp;I have a life? Not really. I have some friends that live in Stevens Point, Wausau, and Schofield, but no one here. Should I say where I live? I live in Manawa. What state?&nbsp; Nope, not gonna tell you that.&nbsp; Don't need any stalkers. Anyway, as I was saying... I don't have a life. So this blog will be filled with work stories, pathetic tales of computer problems, and my take on reality television. I'm addicted to those damn shows!   Well, I hope you're enjoying my site so far! Come back and visit anytime!

      This post is a few days old, but oh well.  I was asked to fill in as a percussionist for a Neenah City Band concert. This is my first time playing with this group, and I thought I would give it a shot. Let me tell you, playing at this rehearsal was a definite ego boost! The director stopped the rehearsal at one time and said, "Why aren't you guys watching me? The only person in this whole band is our new percussionist." And me, being a total nerd threw my hands up in the air and yelled. "YAY!" This made the whole band laugh and start applauding me. I may have actually turned red.  Then as we were getting to the end of rehearsal, we get this song that has a drumset part. Now, I've never been fond of drumset, but I've been playing it more often for pep band at school, so I thought, why not? I volunteer to play it and tell the director that I'll do the best I can. So we play, boom boom boom, crash crash crash. The song ends and I finally take a breath. Once again, the director addresses me, "You played that entire thing almost perfect!" Really? No way! The trombones and tubas were all turning around to tell me how good I did. Really? Now I know I'm turning red, because I'm not used to praise on the drumset. Even the other percussionists there that night were impressed by my skills. My assumtion is, maybe they don't get many good drummers around those parts.   So, our concert is next Tuesday. Let's hope I continue to impress!  Oh, I also had another rehearsal for&nbsp;the China&nbsp;tour today. On my solo piece, I wasn't the least bit nervous for some reason. I was totally relaxed and it allowed my musicality to flow a little more. YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY! I leave for my tour a week from today, whoa.  Hopefully I'll write before I leave. If not, wish me luck!

      So today I had my first computer class that I'm taking for graduate credit.&nbsp; It's all about creating a working website with Frontpage.&nbsp; I've tried that program before and I just couldn't understand it.&nbsp; So after one day, my head is so much clearer!&nbsp; We are supposed to do a 3 page website for our final grade, and by the end of class today, I had completed at least 10 pages!&nbsp;   The website is for my band program, so I'm truly dedicated to this project.&nbsp; I just can't believe how easy the program is, once someone just showed me what all the buttons do!&nbsp; I actually didn't want to leave class at the end of the day.&nbsp; I wanted to learn more and to add more to my website.&nbsp; Am I turning into a computer geek?  Speaking of computers... I got a TV card installed on my computer now!&nbsp; David has been trying to install one, and nothing seemed to be working for him.&nbsp; We've been trying for nearly 2 months!&nbsp; Turns out, all he had to do was check a box.&nbsp; But anyway, I have it installed now and can watch and record TV right on my computer!&nbsp; It's so awesome.&nbsp; Now if I can get my&nbsp;computer to cook a pizza too, I'm set.

      Hi, it's me.&nbsp; Really, who else would it be?   So, not much really happening in my life these days.&nbsp; I've been painting the band room FOR FREE!&nbsp; That's right, I'm dedicating my time to the school so I can teach in a prettier environment.&nbsp; I was getting sick of the 70s color scheme and feeling like I was always in a swimming pool.&nbsp; I've been painting for over a month now, and most of it is done.   I had a dream last night that it was the first day of school, and I was totally unprepared.&nbsp; And to top it off, I had forgotten to wear my shoes.&nbsp; I know that's gotta mean something!&nbsp; Earlier in the night, I also dreamt that I had cancer.&nbsp; I wasn't upset, but rather happy that finally someone would pay attention to me.&nbsp; I think my dreams are trying to tell me something.   How could I forget to mention this?&nbsp; I got accepted into the Master of Music Education program that I applied for!&nbsp; I am now officially a graduate student.&nbsp; I start a summer school class next week, learning about computers and how to make a website.&nbsp; Awesome, it's probably the one thing I really wanted to learn this summer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't think it'll count towards my Masters, but it's still one credit that I need for my teaching license and for the school board.   I think my hamster is dying.&nbsp; Okay, maybe I'm being a little dramatic here.&nbsp; She used to love running around in her ball, but she's not running tonight.&nbsp; I go to look for her and she's just sitting in her ball.&nbsp; She won't chew on the new chew toys I got for her and she hasn't pooped yet tonight (gross, I know, but she seriously poops every 3 minutes it seems.)&nbsp; Maybe she's lonely.&nbsp; But she won't let me snuggle with her and all she does is chew on my shirt when I pick her up.  Well, that's all for my thrilling life for right now.&nbsp; Hey, calm down!&nbsp; Is that really necessary?

      I realize I just posted a few minutes ago, but I have to post again.&nbsp; Just for fun, I thought I would check out what music jobs are open this summer.&nbsp; I've only checked this site a few times since I got my current job, and it was only because I was curious, not that I wanted to leave.  The very first job I see with an opening is Bowler!&nbsp; You may not know, but I did my student teaching in Bowler and absolutely loved it there.&nbsp; I worked with Mr. Marquardt, and I respected him so much.&nbsp; He felt the same for me as a teacher, and really wanted me to stay on as a fulltime teacher, only there wasn't an opening.&nbsp; He even went to the school board and argued a case to create a job for me.&nbsp; Well, it never happened so I moved on.  Now that I have found myself in a wonderful job in Manawa that I have no intention of leaving, Bowler finally has an opening.&nbsp; In fact, the opening was posted just today.&nbsp; For one whole second, I thought about applying for it.&nbsp; Then the second second came and I snapped back to reality.&nbsp; "You are not leaving this job you worked so hard for!&nbsp;&nbsp;Manawa loves you and there is no way in hell you're giving that up!"&nbsp; Yes, all that happened in 2 seconds.  While I loved my time at Bowler, I think it's best to leave that in the past.&nbsp; What if I left this wonderful job to work at Bowler and I ended up not liking it there?&nbsp; Things do change, and it's been 3 years since I taught there last.&nbsp; Besides, I am the head honcho at Manawa, and at Bowler, I would be working under Mr. Marquardt, having to do things his way and losing some of my teaching freedoms.  I feel like I need to slap myself for even considering leaving Manawa.&nbsp; I feel so dirty.&nbsp;   I think this was all meant to happen... something made me check the job board... Bowler just happened to post a job opening today... And I realized how much my current job really means to me.&nbsp; It was a test!&nbsp; While not a perfect score, I think I scored at least a 98%.

      So I decided it would be a good idea this summer to make my band room really pretty (or the best I could do, considering what I had to start with.)&nbsp; I got the principal to approve the painting of the actual band room only.&nbsp; Since I wanted my office and some other rooms done as well, I volunteered to paint them myself (with assistance from some of my students.)&nbsp; The school just pays the cost of paint, brushes, etc.  While I was initially excited about painting, I now am officially sick of it.&nbsp; I have been painting for almost a month, working basically M-F with an occasional day on the weekend.&nbsp; Besides my two week trip, I haven't had a day off of school!  Here's what I've painted for absolutely no pay:&nbsp; 3 door borders, 2 window borders, a door border, my office, the music library room, 9 shelves for the library room, a table, and I'm almost done painting the instrument cubbie room.&nbsp; That in itself isn't too bad, but when you consider I had to move everything off all the shelves, including every single piece of music the school owns, and the school instruments and take down their shelves... WHEW!&nbsp; I guess I wasn't thinking when I volunteered for this.  Granted, everything looks really nice now.&nbsp; I hope my kids appreciate what I did for them this summer.&nbsp; If just one person walks into the band room and complains or says, "This looks gay,"&nbsp;I will freak out on them!  I should also take this time to thank my wonderful students who have helped me:&nbsp; David, Ehren, Kristin and Katrina.&nbsp; You guys have saved me from getting really bitter! :)  I hope to be done painting within the next week.&nbsp; I am also taking a summer school course for two days next week, so that may slow down my progress.&nbsp; But increase my education and bring me one step closer to renewing my teaching licence and moving up the pay scale!

      Well, this will be my last blog for awhile. I'm going&nbsp;to China&nbsp;for almost two weeks. I'm just so excited right now, I don't know what to do with myself. I leave here in 2 1/2 hours, but I'm packed and all ready.   I have this routine of chatting nightly with a certain young man. I'll miss those conversations, as will he, I'm sure. But at least when I come back, I'll probably have lots to talk about!   Oh, I snapped today! I have to deal with this woman who is a total retard. She doesn't know she's a retard, which makes it even more frustrating. I just had it with her today, and I accidentally let it slip "I just want to kick you!" Yes, that's right. I told her flat out. She seemed a little confused, but all the people around me held back their snickering. She is also going&nbsp;to China&nbsp;with me, so by this time in a few weeks, be prepared to read my murder confession right here on this blog.   Let's see, anything else exciting happen lately? Um, not really. Oh, I waxed my legs yesterday. I've done it before and it's no big deal. The first time I did it, I managed to get wax in my hair and on my living room carpet. This time, I only got the wax on my legs. The only thing that scares me about hot wax is the possibility of burning myself. After I took the wax out of the microwave, the first goob I applied hurt like hell, but I survived. So now my legs are nice and smooth! But, I am never doing it myself again. Next time, I'll pay an expert to do it. Is it weird that the actually process of ripping the hair out of my legs doesn't hurt me?   Grrrr, I'm still bored. Still 2 1/2 hours to go.   Want to hear what I packed for my trip? A bunch of clothes, lots and lots of underwear, my toiletries, granola bars, Ammodium AD, shoes, baby wipes, passport, plane tickets, 5 magazines, one book, a swimsuit, sunglasses, camera, sunblock, lots of money, and a teddy bear that I sleep with! I figured, I have the extra room in my suitcase, so why not? I've pretty much been packed for a week, so I don't think I've forgotten anything. But I won't really know that until I get there.   I'm drinking a Sprite right now. I love Sprite. I love Coke too, but sometimes only Sprite will hit the spot.   My pet hamster, Bella, &nbsp;is at my parents' house right now. Believe it or not, I actually miss her! My house is a little too quiet right now. I need the little noffnick to run around and bang into walls. It makes me giggle. I hope she remembers me when I get back.   Well, I guess that's all I have to say for now. Talk to you when I get back!

      I guess it’s been awhile since I’ve written in this blog.  For once, I’m actually doing stuff this summer!  Two weeks ago, I decided to visit the DCE drumline for a day.  I visited during band camp, the camp that up until this year, I had been attending for 3 summers as staff.  It wasn’t awkward or weird or anything to be back there.  The drumline is ¾ new percussionists, so I hardly knew any of them.  Their band just keeps growing in size, I am so jealous.  It was cool to watch a rehearsal without having to do anything, without having to instruct or yell at kids.  This band is so serious about everything they do in rehearsals.  If they are called to attention, the kids SNAP into position and shut their mouths immediately.  I only wish I could get that to happen at Manawa!  Although they look awesome on the field, their sound as they play still needs lots of improvement.  After a day of band, I went to the Wausau fair with Dave and Chris.  I really just wanted cheese curds, that’s the only reason I wanted to go!  But it costs about $5 for parking and $9 to just get into the fair.  So Chris and I parked a few blocks away, and as we’re walking to the fairgrounds, we discover a weak part in the fence.  So Chris and I pulled back the fence and squeezed our way into the fair for free, whoo hoo!  We met Dave inside, who was bitching about having to pay $9, ha ha!  So we ate, and ate, and visited the animals, and ate, and played some games and ate.  When I left, my tummy hurt so bad, but damn the food was yummy!  This past week, I spent the week at my brother’s house with him (Matt), his wife (Dawn) and his step-daughter (Tasha.)  We didn’t do anything special while I was there, just spent time together talking.  It’s funny, but I feel a lot happier being single right now!  Matt and Dawn bickered a lot, and Tasha could get really bratty and talk back to her parents and me.  I was talking to Tasha about going into the 5th grade, and generally talking about school.  She has a major attitude about school and I told her stuff like “You need to write down your homework assignments everyday and don’t blame your teacher if you forget to do your homework.”  When Dawn reminded Tasha that I was a teacher, Tasha actually said, “She’s just a music teacher.”  Oooh, incorrect response.  I’m just trying to help her through some awkward years, but she’s got a major attitude already.  I’m not looking forward to her becoming a full-blown teenager.  A few days later, my parents joined us at my brother’s house, and we took a 2-day vacation to Great America.  It was actually really fun!  Matt and I are big roller coaster lovers, so we managed to go on every one in the park (except Superman, it was closed down.)  As for the rest of my party, they didn’t really do much.  My mom and Dawn hate rides, and Tasha was scared of most of the rides.  Why did my parents choose Great America?  I have no idea.  Of course, they was a lot more bickering going on.  My parents would start yelling in the park, then Matt and Dawn would yell.  Sometimes Dawn would yell at Tasha.  I think I was the only one who didn’t have a reason to scream at someone!  Once again, a perk of being single.  There was one instance where I got mad, but no one understood why I was mad.  There were 6 of us on the trip total, but my dad wanted the gas costs to be split 3 ways… 1) Mom and Dad, 2) Matt, Dawn and Tasha, 3) me.  It doesn’t seem fair that because I’m single, that I had to pay more than everyone else.  But because of another circumstance, I didn’t have to pay.  My brother had basically run out of money, and wouldn’t be able to eat that night if he paid for gas.  So my parents said they would pay his share.  Well, that’s not really fair to me, so they paid my share too.  But I still got upset that no one saw a problem with me having to pay more because I’m single.  I was so happy to get back to my apartment.  I love my bed.  I love my privacy.  I love being in control of my life and doing what I want to do without answering to anyone.  Yesterday I went to a China reunion party in Wausau.  Tracy and I went together and arrived 3 hours late (she had to shower and bake cookies.)  So basically when we got there, everything was dying down and people were going home.  So that sucked.  There were piles of duplicate pictures for people to choose from, but of course the good ones were already taken.  So I feel like yesterday was a big waste of a day, with driving over 2 hours for an hour party.  And we’re up to today!  I went over to school to see if my band class list was ready.  As of today, I have 44 kids enrolled for band.  I was really excited to see some of the names on the list.  I was only disappointed in two kids that dropped.  My awesome baritone player dropped band to take some class on forestry.  And an incoming alto sax player didn’t register.  I looked at her schedule though, and she could still fit band in if she’s willing to give up her study hall.  I’m going to work on her a little.  So in general, I think I have a pretty good band for this upcoming year.  I expect 2 or 3 kids from this current roster to drop out before school starts (word of mouth) so I’ll still have a 41 person band.  I ended the year with 31… definite growth!  I’m looking forward to this upcoming year a lot, but I’ll still be nervous.

      My summer project of painting the band room is officially over!  I do not want any paint on my hands for a long, long time!  David and I finished up painting the top of the cubbies, which was definately the hardest part to paint.  Neither of us are small people, so it was pretty interesting trying to fit in this teeny little opening.  David did most of the work, and he actually crawled around in the dust has that been growing up there for years.  I give him "mad props" for that!  Now I'm not sure what to do with the rest of my summer.  Aside from going to China for 2 weeks, I haven't gone anywhere.  I'm thinking I need to take a trip to Wausau (for two reasons.)  One, I need to get my bike from Logan's house.  It's been there for almost a year now.  Two, I want to visit my old drumline for a day.  I'm thinking I'll go sometime this week and watch band camp.  This brings up another topic.  Even thought I have worked with the DCE drumline for 3 summers, I don't really miss working with them this summer.  Don't get me wrong, the kids were absolutely wonderful (aside from a few snare drummers that thought they were better than me.)  But I never really felt valued as an instructor.  The kids valued me, but not my fellow drumline instructors and not the band director.  At least, that's how I felt.  I had more to offer, but I felt like I was always being pushed back.  It got really bad last year, and I was ready to quit.  Right during band camp, in fact.  But the week after band camp, I was hired to work at Manawa, so I moved on and forgot about it.  And now I'm in Manawa and am fully engrossed in prettifying my own band room, so I don't worry about Everest anymore.  Okay, that was an out of nowhere rant.  Sorry about that!  So I think I'll visit Everest this week and then next week I'm going to Great America with my family.  That should be interesting.  My brother and I are the only ones who go on roller coasters (or any rides for that matter.)  My mom can't go on anything, because she is disabled.  And my dad, sister-in-law, and niece don't really like rides.  So why are we going to Great America?  That's the question I just can't seem to answer.  Other than that, I think I'll be watching a lot of TV and getting bored.  Maybe I'll start walking around town.  I need the exercize and some fresh air might be nice.
