      Today I was walking to 3rd period and someone was listenin' to rap on their CD player.Around that time I decided that rap sucks. I mean, all it is is a bunch of guys talkin bout their problems and complainin. Eminem: No one cares bout' your family life. It's your problem, not ours. If you want to feel better about it I suggest that you go to therapy. R.Kelly: Don't piss on teens. We don't like it.Seek help. Also, Jacko is in jail,right? Pedo's freak me out. Knock Knock. Who's there? Little Boy Blue. Little Boy Blue who? Michael Jackson. What does Michael Jackson like about 28 year-olds? There are 20 of them. He should be given the electric chair. Oh wait, Californya dosen't kill former pop idols. Oh well, just gotta take over the world then. Later

      Had band practice afterschool. Like always, there was a 30 min. break between school getting out and practice startin. A good excuse to hang out with Josh and Laney. Found out that PDA (public display of affection) is the new most hated rule. How gay is that rule? Quite gay in my opinion. Other than that, nothin happened.

      Band practice this afternoon. Got really mad at some guys from my section. Namely Zach and Alex. Zach for squirting me with a water bottle and dumpin salt on me. Subsequently, he made me want to do mean, horrible, terribly painful things to him. As for Alex, well that kid needs to take some Ritalin or something. Or a muzzle would work. No wait scratch that. A straight jacket would work. He's had to do more push-ups than Brittany Spears bra.(Now watch the people come flocking to this site.) Seriously, if I were section leader, he would be skinny by now."You moved, 90 push-ups.) Band nerds are better than regular nerds cause they can count to four while playing music. They rock. I'm mad. And bored.L8er

      Well, folks, it has been officialy decided that if Hell is on Earth, it's in Arkansas. Now you might be asking yourself "Official? Thats misspelled!" or " Who decides these things?". Well ask no more. For the first thing, I don't care. If you do, leave a comment. As for the second, the board of Places that Suck decided this early this morning. Who are they? Me, my girlfriend, Josh, Laney, Justin, and Tripp, that's who! Arkansas sucks. They gave us Bill Clinton. Also, they have very bad roads, huge spiders, and uber-redneck rodeos. Plus, it's either really hot or really cold, no median. Arkansas=Hell.
