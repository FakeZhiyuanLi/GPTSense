      Day 2...Well it was a resting day. I went through paperwork and sorted it into files. Watched some TV and played on the net. Nothing major. Tristan finally cleaned his room (for the most part). You can at least walk in without falling on something. It was a long day. Ended by a movie on TNT or something like that. THE VIRGIN SUICIDES. That is a weird movie. Well stay tuned to see how day 3 ends up.

      Day 1...Yard work. That's about all there is to say. All day from 8am - 8pm and it's only half done.If anybody ever wants to exercise you are more than welcome to come over and push mow my yard or rake up the grass. It's hell. I think that my next house will have only like a quarter of an acre insead of 2 acres. It impossible to be caught up ever. So day 1 I was dirty, sweaty, and smelly.

      Finally it happened. My house is clean thanks to Will. He came over tonight and together we got through the mess. The kids were away and now I can see the floor in every room except theirs. Tristan has to clean his room tomorrow. Michelle I think that he is finally gonna have to do it. So after an afternoon of cleaning I decided to surf the web. Have a great night, I know I will now.

      So I just wanted to update everyone on my evening. My goal of finishing laundry...didn't happen. My house looks like someone threw a bomb in it. Michelle can vouch for the time it takes to undo my doing. What a day!

      So I hear that blogging is all the rage now a days. I thought that I would give it a try. Michelle says that everyone should have a blog so I took that and ran. I really just started this on the spur of the moment so I don't have much to say quite yet. It's been a long hot weekend. So I'm gonna follow my goal of the day and finish ALL of my laundry.

      So I haven't blogged in while. Not much has been going on. Last weekend I went to West Viginia with Will's family for his family reunion. Was sorta boring but okay. I am sure that I will not remember anyone that I met. Just been hanging around the house. Well I shall try to find more intersting subjects to write about soon. I promise.

      Day 3...Pretty normal Saturday. Played, cleaned and watched movies with Michelle. We watched Igby Goes Down and Under The Tuscan Sun. Both of which are very good. Thanks Michelle for another great movie night.
Day 4... Horrible day. Started okay then I realized that my keys were missing. Spent all day cleaning and looking for my keys. No luck. Had to call Will's sister, Tracy, to bring milk and cigs. Couldn't make it without those 2 very neccesary things.
Day 5...Memorial Day. Still looking for the keys. Will's dad, Jerry came over with Marie and they also helped look for the keys. No luck. Now if you know my house it's very small, how could I not find my keys by now. Well I now had to make arrangements to get to work on Tuesday. Ended the day with no cigs and little milk.
