      I just got back from my grandma's house. Jake has gotten so big. I love when Stan comes back to town. He's really fun to talk to. We have alot of the same taste in music. Like today I found out that one of his favorite bands is Radiohead, which I am completely in love with. He has every single one of their CDs. That really rocks. I wish I had some of their earlier stuff. Once I can afford it after a few weeks this summer, I am going to pick one up, because all I have is OK Computer and Hail to the Thief. But that was really cool that we shared that in common. because I love talking about Radiohead. Just because their so innovative and keep reinventing their sound in these really ingeneous ways. Yeah, Mike bought me this CD of some band that I dont really know who it is...Bad Religion (?).. I think I've heard of them, but its probably just another Atheist, hate God, conformist punk group. I'll have to check it out before I make my final judgement. I'm by myself tonight and my parents are at some dumb party. I think I'll call Sara later. I miss the boys, they're so much fun to hang out with, besides the fact that I have crushes on a few of them, but I guess I'll just have to do without tonight...(sigh). Well, I'm going to go get started on The Crucible and Sophie's World after I see what Sai is up to.

      I just got home from Emily and Lisa's. We watched Mystic River. It was pretty good. Really well acted and a great plot, but it kinda dragged in places, but I still really liked it..I got paid 60 bucks today for babysitting and it was damn well worth it. Today Emily crapped in the little potty training chair and I actually had to take the little pot or whatever and dump it in the toilet and then clean it out. She also wet her pants while I was putting them back on her from the 10 seconds before when she had just peed, so I got someone elses urine on me for the first time ever today. Nah, it wasnt really that bad, they're good kids. I have to babysit for the twins three day next week. That is going to be rough..I really hope she'll pay me for it, they are a huge handful. Tomorrow we have to do a roadblock for a fundraiser. That's probably something I am least willing to do. Almost like soliciting to people at the mall during one of those first fundraisers. I have no shame left after all the hell we've been through this year with raising this money, so what the hell? Stan and Linda are coming down with Jake for his birthday tomorrow, so I get to spend the afternoon with them and then my parents are going to some party and I guess I'll hang by myself or something. I miss Jamie and Darcie. They were here this time last summer. I remember they gave me $50 to save because they just knew that I would got to Scotland, and sure enough I am. THat was awesome that they were the first ones. I really want to go to Boston to see them, in fact, my mom was talking to Jamie about it last time they talked (Jamie's my uncle by the way, Darcie's his girlfriend. He had this awesome band named Love Jones that was really big up there, but they broke up this year..) I want to go up there just so I can  see  Emerson. I know I'm not going to go there, I just want to look at it just once so I can pretend..Damn the man who dealt me these cards in the poker game of life...No, college in Georgia will be..great.

      I had a fun little day today. I started babysitting Emily and Dawson again. They've grown up since last summer, which is really good because Emily was so hyper and required so much attention. I still have to chase her 45 mintues out of every hour to keep her entertained, but better than nonstop for 6 hours. She jumped on my neck today and while we were watching Barney all the sudden I felt these pains down my spine and i got this awful headache. Its times like that when I wonder if I can take 3 days a week...I stayed at practice until 10 tonight. We finally got all that nasty blocking done. Its always a pain in the ass, but i love it when the show finally comes together in the last two weeks. I love that good stress you feel when it comes down to the wire.

      Looking back, it was dumb that I deleted my entire blog just because Chris got in trouble with his. He was writing derogatory things about members of the same sex and what he'd like to do with them, but we'll assume we won't have that problem here. I really miss this, I miss just being open about things. I'm kind of sad or depressed or one of those really uncomfortable feelings you just can't put your finger on. Actually I think I'm just kind of disappointed in myself at the fact that my summer isn't going as planned. I'm still hanging out with the same people all the time instead of trying to get to know  everyone  better like I originally planned. And its not even that, its that I give off the little Erin facade of being flirty and ditzy all the time. Facade isn't the right word, I guess I just keep using that side of myself because its the easiest to show. Its either the two extremes, the bitch or the flirt. I guess that's not all my fault anyway because noone really cares enough to get to know me to crack into that. No one has been talking about anyone yet, that's a good thing. After the whole audition thing when I heard that Kim and Rachel were saying stuff behind my back, I got really worried but everything's been awesome so far. Kim and Rachel were telling me how bad of a flirt I was the other night and that worries me, because I don't want to come off that way all the time. Like that one time Lacy was trying to make me feel bad and told me Mr. Davis said that I was smarter than I let on. Man, I'm sounding all different shades of retarded right now. I just read what I wrote and I sound like I've overdosed on Prozac. I guess its one of those lonely things, like I really want to sit down and have a conversation but there's no one to talk to except my parents. You know how statistics show that suicide rates increase during Christmas holidays due to loneliness? The older I've goten the more that rings true, because summers are a bitch for me, because I never see anyone. Except for this one, this Scotland trip is going to rock. I may have to start working at Dekalb next week because I need money to buy clothes bad. I hate having lost all that weight, but having no clothes to show for it. I still need to lose a good 30 or 40 pounds. I started back dieting Monday after I went a little crazy last week, but Sara convinced me to eat when she came over last night cause we all know how Sara is about food, right? Well, I'm going to try to find something amusing to do...Oh my crap. They are watching a Giovanni Ribisi movie without me, gotta go, gotta go.

       Wash your hands clean of yourself, baby, yeah, step down..  My mom is, by far, the only reason I am able to continue living in this house. She has really good advice sometimes, and one of those times is now. I hate those times when someone just changes and you dont know why or if it had anything to do with you, and if it did, what you did wrong. Oh well, I just feel really overwhelmed right now. I think I need to just take a break for a little while and hang out by myself and not plan to do so much. Well, I am being forced off the computer. I have a lot to say, but I guess it'll have to wait until later.

      I have never been more ready for this week to be over. All that babysitting...I have a feeling I'll never get Patty LaBelle's version of the alphabet from that Sesame Street video out of my head since I was forced to watch it 41 times (oh yes, I counted..). Oh, and don't let me forget the wonderful Disney classics I revisited this week: Peter Pan, Cinderella, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and Alice in Wonderland. My body is more sore from those kids jumping all over me, more than the dancing we did for the show. Nah, it was actually fun, and the kids are really cute. I even taught Emily how to say 'Brad Pitt is hot.' oh, speaking of scandalous things, sara has her house all to herself this weekend. I kind of want to go over there tonight but its already 10:30, and I dont want my dad to have to take me over there because he might not let me stay if he finds out her parents arent there, even though he's let me do it before. But tomorrow I am definately spending the night, and we've got to take advantage of this oppurtunity since we didnt last time. I want to hang out with Bam Margera for a few days, he would be so fun.

      I'm talking to Sara on the phone. She called me earlier today and told me about this dream she had, and she said it was the scariest, most awful dream ever about me dying and everyone was at my funeral. she said the eulogy about how i didnt believe in borders in life, and no matter where i was at that momment, i was everywhere because i had no limits. crazy stuff..i think the dream is symbolic of us growing apart these past few weeks. okay, now i'm off the phone. but anyway, back to what i was saying, when sara came to hang out the other night, i realized how much i missed her being around all the time. It's so much fun being crazy when Sara's around.            I officially started back on the Erin Diet today. For some reason, it makes me feel better when i do without as much food, than just bein able to eat what i want. I guess I needed a couple of weeks to enjoy myself, but I definately lost sight of the goal. BUt I'm not beating myself up or anything because I'm not at the weight I wanted to be at this momment, because I think losing as much weight as I have in the past year is pretty impressive. So, I'm just going to watch it like I was before and do and hour of cardio everyday, and weights when I can get to the gym, and I think that will help me get back into the swing of things.

      Kim just left my house, we went to go see Troy. It was the 2nd time I saw it, but I can never get enough of sexy, naked Brad! GGgggrrrRrrr..I had a lot of fun. We dressed all sassy and wore stilettos. Fun, fun. Sara said I was mean to her today. I don't know how she came to that conclusion, I just didnt very much time to talk in between practice and babysitting..Babysitting which I did not get paid for. That made me so mad. I spent my whole afternoon there and she didnt even mention paying me. I really just havent been having a good week I dont guess. We have been choreographing the show, and that's fun even though I screw it up most of the time. You know, sometimes I cant stand the summer. It annoys me that I cant be doing something productive with a larger portion of my day. I hate just being by myself at the house. This is going to have to change.

      I feel so bad for my mom. She took my grandparents to the beach, which isnt as normal as that sounds because they've been divorced and remarried twice, and now their both single and my grandpa's so horny that he wants my grandma now. That's a really funny sight too, because my grandpa can barely keep his balance. He staggers around, like one time he came to GrammaLynne's house and he was hug her or kiss her or something and he knocked over her lamp while he was chasing her around the living room. Actually that's not that funny, because everytime we go to Wal-Mart,  I have to go get the scooter for him to drive around, and last time we were there he wrecked the scooter into  my  car and now there's a big dent. And my grandma can be kind of crazy too, sometimes in a funny way, but sometimes really scary. She loads of fun to talk about hot guys with, like the time she sent me a valentine's day card with a naked man in it, that is awesome. Or the time she alked about growing pot in her garden just so she could try it once. But Lord knows, she drives my mom insane..So hopefully my mom will be of good mind when she gets home tomorrow. Maybe I'll take her to do something SINCE I HAVE MONEY NOW!!! hell yeah..

      Queen is so awesome, I was listening to Bohemian Rhapsidy (i'm too tired to spell that right, obviously). My mom left to go to the beach this morning. My dad will not get off my freaking back. This is going to suck until Tuesday when my mom gets back. How did it happen that since I have grown up, my dad has gotten so anal about everything and my mom has gotten so laid back when they were completely opposite of that when i was younger. Like right now, my dad has got something shoved up his ass about me having company. WTF? I mean, I'm an only child and I'm bored out of my mind being by myself 16 hours out of every day. Like tomorrow, I will babysit for Alice's kids from 3-6 after practice. GOD. MY DAD IS SUCH AN ASS! He's telling me how lazy I am and all this crap you probably couldnt understand unless you were me right now. He's just a pain..oh well, i find a way to deal with it until my mom gets back. I did have fun tonight though. It was really funny actually, like we played hide and seek, sardines, and we played in the rain and played my playstation with all the weird random games mike bought for me..it was cool. well i have to go clean up the house before my dad has an aneurism, jeezis...haha. its actually kind of funny how retarded he is about things being clean, you just cant help but laugh. oooo. i found Kevin's sock, i need to give it back to him tomrrow. i'll put it right here by the door.

      I have to write this down so I'll remember how bad off I am. I am so worn out that when my CD player just died, I went to  the refrigerator  to look for new batteries. What's even worse is that I spent time looking for them in it before realizing what I was doing.

      I say such stupid stuff when I'm tired. In fact, I dont even think I said that (KIM), so there! I just got back from Lisa and Emily's. I could not stop laughing the whole time. The guys that work at Krystals kept hitting on us, asking us if they could be 'a part of our clique.' And after that a bunch of funny stuff happened, and I swear I have never laughed that much in my life. Haha, I just read Sara's profile. I can't believe you figured out that we only like you because your parent free house is THE SPOT (cough-formeandyoutobringboysoverandfulfilloursexualfantasiesat-cough). Whhoooo, excuse me. Anyways..I'm watching Zoolander, which is probably why I'm talking about Sara, since its the movie about our life. "What, were you coming to tell me what a bad EUGOOGALIZER i was?" story of my life for real, making up and misusing words, because  I can . Oh, Sai, remind me to tell you about the super funny porn I passed over last night when I was going to sleep. The name of one of the characters was Dickus Minimus..real sexy, right?

      Today has been a fun day. You know, the usual stuff, talking to hott boys on the internet, having all my friends over, turning off all the lights and having sex all night. same old, same old. Sara has a blog now http://johnnydepps_loveslave.blogspot.com. Yep, and i'm going to help her hook up the old A-I to the M and then she'll be fawesome and good to go. I wanted to spend the night with her and Rach tonight, but i just didnt know if all of us could get ready in time for practice in the morning. We'll definately do something fun during our two hour break between practices. It's taken me two hours to write five sentences. I forgot what I was even going to say. Um, the show is going good. Just had a bad day the other day, made a retarded mistake, not worth all the fuss I made about it. That's what comes with being a girl, MELO-DRAH-MATIKS..ugh. But anyway, I babysat today. Woke up 10 minutes before I was supposed to be there and decided I didnt feel good enough to go, but I did anyways. So while I was there, Emily shit in her potty chair TWICE and I had to clean it up both times. I'm going to start charging extra by the size and smell of the shit. I figure that will make me a big profit. Nah, I'm just kidding. Then I went to practice for a few hours, and then went to eat at Zaxby's with some people from practice afterwards. That was fun. Those guys are so hilarious, I could not stop laughing. And I've been talking to Daniel and Kim on the internet, while I have gotten so tired I've forgotten all the details of my day. The End.

      I love bad days. That seems dumb,but the reason I say that is because when a day is bad, the next one has to be better, even if it is bad too, logically its not as bad as the day before, unless you make it that way. I understand I was late. I didnt prepare enough time to get there during the rain, so I took the whole "Iwouldnt want to spend time in hell with you" speech. I tried to get over it and do my very best the rest of the time. Inf act, I got so caught up in doing things right, that when Joseph told me to move a bench from the table so Kevin could get it, I accidently did it after Mr. Davis told us to do something did it. Thatwas really dumb of me I know, because I shouldnt listen to other people anyway, and I should have thought about what I was doing. As much as I wanted someone to look bad at the moment with me, when Mr Davis asked who told me to do that, I just said 'nobody' I figure being the better person means just taking all the blame instead of taking someone down with you. I just cant stand that I looked stupid in front of people I have a lot of respect for. Then I got yelled at again because someone on the other side of the house was asking me a question and I stupidly answered them  just  at the wrong moment  again . Kim said she would have cried, and I still have that feeling in my throat, but I have more determination in me than that to let one bad night get in the way of the whole goal. Even if no one has faith in me and everyone hates me, I'm still going to give it my all. My parents dont understand that. Him yelling at me really made my mom upset and my dad asked why i just did nt just stop taking his classes and drop out. The answer to that is simple for me. I dont do theatre for Mr. Davis or for anyone else. And even if he doesnt put me up on that stage ever again like he threatened to tonight (probably like I deserve) I'll still be involved. And I also have a responsibility as an officer that I am not going to slack on. So even if Mr Davis thinks I'm good for nothing, I'm still going to do my best to prove my devotion to what we do. I still think I am going to cry, and I really dont want to go back. I really just hope I dont get yelled at anymore.

      Awesome! I just weighed and I've lost 6 pounds since I started back dieting. That feels good. I need to straighten Rachel out. It is pretty bad that I lether shit around like that. I could pay for her to go to the gym the next few weeks or something and make sure we really control her eating, because I just dont think Atkins is working for her anyway. My horoscope said today was a day of fun. It also said my love life would take a turn for the unexpected and something that broke all the rules of what i have learned would happen. Yum. Unsolved Mysteries didnt come on this morning and this is the one morning I will be home. Darn. Oh well, I need to read my summer reading some today. Or maybe I wont and just do something with sara instead. Yeah, she told me Lacy is trying to get her to talk bad about me. I'm sorry our little friendship didnt work out or whatever, but i was just sick and tired of her copying everything a couple of sophomores liked and did. But what did that get me? Her screwing around the words of a conversation we had and telling Mr. Davis I said something I didnt say. That pisses me off more than you can imagine. I just hope he doesnt hold what that fat ass bitch lied about against me. If she hadnt have done that, I would make an effort to be nice to her, but not now, because I have absolutely no respect for liars. I hate liars.

      I had the day from hell today. Last night my mom called me and told me I had to babysit again today when i wasnt even supposed to because Emily and Dawson were sick. She said they werent contagious, but this morning I come to find out that it is, and I had those little kids coughing on me all day. The last thing I need is to be sick. Those kids are so cute, but they follow me in the bathroom and stand right over me as I pee and Emily kept hitting my boobs all day and giggling. That got really annoying. Then I came straight to practice, which is just hell in itself. The guys can sit around and goof off or jack off or whatever the hell they want and Mr. Davis would never speak a word to them. But when the girls try to figure out where we go after a number we havent blocked the exit of-oh hell no, its a completely different story, we get bitched up and down. But it has always been that way and probably always will, so what can you do. Most of the time when he yells specifically at me, it makes me really want to prove that i'm not fucking retarded, but nights like tonight, i just wanted to say fuck it and get the hell out of there. On top of that, my dad comes in at, oh, lets say 8:00 and just sits there and since good ole Robby Davis said that practices would last till 10 or 11, i told him to go home. Well when I call at 9:15, my mom said,"you're dad said he wasnt coming to get you." I just thought, 'what the crap, no one wants to take me home. he has no choice.' so my dad starts arguing with me and telling me i can stay up there all night and wont let me talk to mom about it and mom wont just put her foot down and tell hard headed mark whatley to get his ass in the car. But its fine now... i'm just really stressed out. On a different note, I have a crush on someone. He thinks I'm retarded, I'm pretty sure, but hey thats okay. Sara and I are already planning how we're going to seduce our guys. When she calls me at 11:37 we're going to figure out our next move for tomorrow, since there wasnt one for today, it sucked. I thought I had otned down my flirting, well okay, i tried, kind of..but Kim says I'm still bad, and someone even called me a slut, but she wont let me name who. Me, a slut? Thats  crazy ..

      I just got home from the mall. Oh my gosh, Jack, my little cousin, would not stop crying. My mom offered to keep him for two nights, so this morning I woke up at 8:30 when I had gone to bed at all of one o'clock and had to sit up and watch DragonTales and other queer ass GPTV Educational Cartoons while my mom took a shower. Then I had to go and get my tooth filled. The shot always freaks me out, but i love when my whole mouth is numb and i cant tell if its open or closed. Its like volutarily taking cold medicine, extremely pointless fun. So the whole rest of the day I've just been drunk off of lack of sleep and that drill rattling my brains around. I did get a few new outfits. I'm so glad I started babysitting. I had the weirdest day yesterday. We went to Tifton for Father's Day to see my grandpa and we always go to Wal-Mart. I had to stay with my mom almost the whole time, because I went to go look at CDs and this group of Mexican guys kept following me around. Even with my mom there, they kept on showing up and checking me out and stuff. It made me really uncomfortable, but we finally left and went to the Cracker Barrel and i saw these two guys there checking me out, so I tried to avoid them. One of them was kind of cute, and the other was alright, but I hate wating my time with guys I'll never see again. But after we ate, me and my 10 year old cousin Carrie were sitting outside in the rocking chairs and they came and sat by me and tried to say hey and start talking to me, but I got up. I would have hated it if my parents would have come out and seen me flirting with two random guys when I was supposed to be hanging out with my cousin. SO that's that story. I had a lot of fun shopping today. I got a workout walking up and down there with big ole Jack in one arm and my bags in the other. I got two new skirts, two shirts, and an awesome new bra from Victoria's Secret. Well, I gotta head off to play practice. I hope I remember all of my blocking and the dances. I want Mr D to be pleased and all. I hope I dont have to say my line..yuck, i suck.

      I had a pretty cool day today. I miss seeing my family like I used to. I havent really seen them since during  Oliver!  with all of the fundraisers and practices and stuff. I got to hang out with my cousin, Carrie. She's almost 11, I cant believe that because I can remember when she was born. I got to lay out and swim all afternoon. I'm about to go to my uncle's birthday party, and since my mom volunteered to keep my 2 year old cousin Jack for the weekend, there's an extra kid to look after. It'll be cool though. Well my mom wants to check her email, so I'm off.

      I am definately feeling a lot better than I was from that post earlier. I didnt know how to deal with an issue, and I was driving myself insane (obviously).. In times like these, I have to remember my favorite quote: "This too shall pass." Like I told Lisa when we were going through whatever drama was happening at the moment this year, to me this quote should be used in all situations. Like when something unbelievable awesome happens, I think to myself this is completely awesome, nothing can top this ever, I will never be down ever again until I remember "this too shall pass." And at times when I'm sad, things dont go my way, or anything thats beyond my controll that upset me I know that "this too shall pass." So in this specific situation, even though things can probably never work out completely as I would like them to, I just have to trust that all these negative things will work out as well as they can and something really cool and awesome will happen that I never expected. Its hard to live that way, trying to believe something and move forward to the next step, when all you want to do is go backwards. After every really fun, good thing I find there's always something hindering me from having good days for a little while after it. I dont know if its bad karma, or I have so much fun in one night that God thinks I should equal my good and bad days out so all the rest of the world doesnt have as much fun as me or what. But I am sick of wasting days obsessing over things that dont even matter a week after they happen. This doesnt seem like one of those, but if it is..I wont be happy. Although, some part of me does hope its one of those. I have got to shut up...No one knows what I'm talking about except me--wait a minute, story of my life..

I am about to explode, but I cant talk about it. I dont even feel guilty, just about getting caught. I'm really disappointed in myself now. There's more to it, but I've got so many thoughts on my mind I dont know where to start.

      Hehehehe. Chris gave me that fun CD that we made up during Ms. Kirks Drama class. It's so fun. I miss seeing Chris and talking about all the hott boys. I fell during the curtain call tonight. I am so happy that happened then. I've been waiting for that for the past 3 shows we've done this year. Finally some relief. Hehehe. It was a GREAT fall too. I finally stole the scene, hehehe. Nah, I think I was just so exhausted that my knees buckled, because it was strangely not my dress's fault. Oh well, it was fun. The show didnt go as bad as I expected it go. It was pretty decent for a second night show. There were a few music problems, but we made some good saves. Props were flying everywhere and getting left as well. I'm just glad I survived tonight. What am I saying?!? I'm glad I survive every night I'm ever in a show. This one especially because the company's on stage the entire time. Yeah, we went to Sonic afterwards. That was fun. I felt bad like I was leaving Lisa, Emily, Laura, and Lacy out. Joseph is super funny. When he dropped me off at my house he saw the three raccoons that live in my garage and he got a golf club to beat the crap out of them, but they disappeared. He said he'd come back and beat the shit out of them. That was hilarious. I would have laughed my ass off if one of them would have come and bit him in the face. But yeah, I dont feel like writing anymore. I think I'm going to go dance to Baby Got Back.

      Boys make me SO MAD. That's about all there is to say. They just piss me off to no end. I dont even know what the hell is up.  Some people  just CANT take it but they sure as hell can dish it out...First of all the dress rehearsal was just as much of a disaster as last night. Then i waited for Rachel to get ready so we could practice a part of the show and while I did that, Mr Blaise commented on how short my skirt was. I'm so sorry, I cant help that the stage is high above the ground. My bad, but noooooo, just say something really pervy in front of everyone to make me feel super grossed out and uncomfortable. And then please, everyone ignore me, especially one person who I feel like slapping in the face because they lied to me. Then please, keep on about my skirt, Kevin, that makes me super happy. I am never wearing that skirt in front of those people ever again if its so "slutty" and "permiscuous." And also, I wish if someone just didnt want anything to do with me anymore or had a problem with me, they'd just let me know instead of pretending nothing's up. Because that "uncomfortable phase" or whatever we decided to call that has been over. We talked about it and  everyone else  has gotten over it, so I dont even know what to think now when you flirt with and are nice to every one else, but you're a dick to me. Story of my life, right? I'm giving up right now at this very moment, and saying screw it because I am sick and tired of trying to make things work and always getting the shitty end of the deal.

      The show went terrible last night. Absolutely awful. When I went out to eat with Lisa, Emily, Laura, and Sara the other night, we all talked about how much energy we wanted to have and really make the show great. And we've really been giving it a lot. But something happened last night, and the very beginning just sucked. It was awful, no one was precise in anything they did in Once Upon the Natchez Trace and I just sank inside and my energy just left. It just makes me nervous that its two days before and instead of getting tighter, there's more adlibing and stuttering over lines. Yuck. Tonight has to be the night. Somethign really wow and amazing has to happen and its going to. I refuse to be embarrased by the quality of our show, when its something we can very well control. I was so sick last night though. I had spent all morning in the costume room cleaning up rat poop and trying to get things really organized, but my allegies started getting really bad because I forgot to take my medicine and i was breathing in all that dust. It did feel good to be helping doing something up there. At least I could be a part in accomplishing a little bit. I wasnt in trouble when I got home either, like I thought I would be for asking my dad to drive me up there late the other night since Mom would be gone to Tifton and couldnt take me. He gave me up and down the country that night, but he was really nice when I got home. I'm really glad that worked out, because I wouldnt have been able to take it. But anyways, I took my allegy medicine right before practice and it made me really drowsy JUST LIKE ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO..i was so mad, but I could barely talk or remember what I was doing, so I was miserable and it really sucked because I need all the practice I can get. Tonight is make or break, and I swear to God, I am going to be making because I have put too much into this for it to not be the best thing I have ever done. So there's no choice, everyone just has to come together and make something really amazing out of all this chaos, the end**

      I wasted my entire day today. I should have read all day, but I have put it off AGAIN. My horoscope said I would. I actually had fun waking up when I wanted to for the first time all week and then having no responsibilities. But I've had a horrible headache all day too, so that kinda sucks. I got to hang out with the girls before practice like I never do, so that was really fun and a change finally from waiting for something interesting to happen. I've figured out why my life is like it is sometimes. See, God gives a person a certain amount of fun, interesting and new things to do and allows them a certain amount of time they can do these things, just so the person wont go buck wild all the time. But see, I think God forgets that I'm down here sometimes, i guess because I dont pray enough, but when he gets to me once a week or once every two weeks, I think he looks down from his lunch date with Jesus and says 'oh yeah, that little Whatley kid hasnt had fun in a while' and then he conjures up a lot of fun for me all at once, then he realizes I've run over my bill in allowed amounts of fun and decides to create a miniature version of hell in my life for a couple of weeks until everything has cancelled itself out and I can start over again. I can pretty much say that this little cycle has been going on since the beginning of May. Instead of my fun being like a Dollar Store brand battery that has a big burst of energy when you first use it and then fizzles out, I want to be like that awesome pink bunny on the Energizer comercials so I can go around beating on my fun little drum like its going out of style. I'm just sick of being sad and spending time worrying. It makes me feel like I never accomplish anything, because all I want to do is move on and go back to normal. But I cant do that until i know  everyone  is alright, and I guess by the way things look, I might just have to wait to put my bunny ears on for a tad bit longer. (teehehe!)

      I just got my Coldplay CD back from my mom. She had it in her car and never listened to it. Its a wonderful CD. I am so glad I have Sara around sometimes. I joke around with her by calling her Jimminy, but if she werent around, I would probably would go crazy from not being able to tell anyone the reasons I do things. I'm glad there is at least one person that I can be honest with everything about (not that I cant be honest with Rachel or Lisa, because I can, but their not always around like Sara is..) Sara just made me realize how I say some things to people just to please them or make them feel better and satisfy whatevr is making them mad instead of actually saying how i feel or standing my ground completely. I know I do it, I learned it from my mom and it sucks. And at the beginning of the school year, I had a friendship with someone where it was a constant argument that could never be won, and I guess now I would rather just have peace in a situation rather than proving my point. Besides, this person likes to think they have all control and attention anyway, and I have been through this with them before and if I can let her think she's won whatever it is they're searching to win then I have won myself some peace and I can go on about my life. And besides, I hate when people are mad at me. For some reason I cant live with myself when someone has a problem with me that i CAN control. So I fixed it, and I feel a hell of a lot better now. I found some things out today from another friend that helps me completely understand where the very root of this problem is, and what is it--Just what I expected it to be...jealousy. So now I understand it all, and I can finally move forward after this terrible week of dishonesty and finally move on with my normal life, because I cant live with myself one more moment if I have to be deceitful anymore and I think the very last bit of that was taken care of last night. So now I can start being normal, fun Erin again without having any shit to deal with and thats exactly what I plan to do. Whew, feels good to get all that out.   "Hey, come on, try a little. Nothing is forever. There has to be something better than in the middle. But me and Cinderella put it all together. We can drive it home with one headlight.."

      I am having a blast.&nbsp; I had the worst day ever yesterday. It definitely sucked. It was a lot of stuff. In fact, nothing went right, but sometimes that happens and you just have to roll with it until everything cools down. I am so beat, I have gotten hardly any sleep in the past week because I love staying awake so much and then I either had to get up early and babysit or wake up at the crack of dawn to go to Tifton with my mom. I was hoping I would get to sleep tomorrow, but I found out that I have to go pull weeds and shit out of the Memorial Garden. I think I'm just not going to set my alarm and sleep until I wake up, and if it is way late, I wont go unless someone calls me, but if I have gotten good sleep and I wake up in time I will go. I'll get to tan some too. I just dont want to get tired out in the sun all day working. I want to be good and energetic for our last show here :( I dunno, but I really need to go since I feel like I'm going to be a weak officer next year with all of my commitments to drama. Like being gone the first week, which is our big week and during One Act&nbsp;a lot of stuff goes on. I thought it was fawesome that my three best friends and I made up our class's officers (Sara is Student Body Vice Prez, Rach is Jr. Class Prez, I'm Jr. Class VP and Lisa is Jr. Class Sec/Tres.) but it is definitely going to be hard with all of us missing from&nbsp;projects and events. We'll make it work, for sure. I'm just excited about being a&nbsp;drama officer this year. I'm so happy I dont have two offices like I thought I wanted.&nbsp;That was really strange how that worked out.&nbsp;I&nbsp;just ran for Jr. Thespian Secretary because I wanted to run for a&nbsp;Thespian office and&nbsp;I thought it would be interesting to see what happened if I ran against Sara. I&nbsp;felt bad when I got it and I really hoped that I didnt get Historian then because I knew Sara would be pissed, but I didnt and it all worked out cool. I wonder who I will work with now that Jason is staying. I want him to be able to keep his job. Oh well, I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Well, I think I'm going to go read my awesome five hundred and thirteen page philosophy book that I have to read for Mr. Davis. It's actually really interesting. I need to go change out of my fun pink outfit that I wore today too.

      Dang, I have got to stop spending money. Sara's cousin Katie got here from Louisiana yesterday. We went had strawberry daquiris at El Maya's and then spent the night at Sara's. I was so glad because I had spent all day in Tifton babysitting Carrie, Katie, and Jack. I did get to lay out, so I'm getting a fa-huh-huh-awesome tan. I just didnt want to stay out to long to where my face got red. I have just been so tired lately. I fell asleep for about an hour at the dermatologist's office yesterday morning waiting on my grandpa, and then while the kids were watching Blue's Clues and running around, I completely fell out. It would have been terrible if something were to have happened while I was passed out. Those kids are into EVERYTHING and they are always fighting so I am suprised nothing did happen. But just as we were leaving my mom invited my seven year old cousin Katie to spend the night with us since her mom would be bringing all three of them to Chuck E. Cheese the next day. So I was really pissed, but I didnt even have to deal with her, besides her using all of my spray and pretending to curl her hair with my curling irons while I was. That was cute though, I can live with that. So, me, Sara, and Katie got up and went to Chuck E. Cheese today. It wasnt that bad actually. It just sucked for me and Say that time we stayed there for 5 hours. Then we went shopping. Oh my gosh, I have got to stop spending money. I bought the CUTEST purse at American Eagle. Oh, and I got some fun panties from Victoria's Secret. It was all 50% off. I was SO excited. I had to control myself though...yeah. Well I have been on the go non stop it seems like, and I am kinds nervous about the show tonight since we havent practiced in a week. I saw Tim and Rach when we were leaving the mall. I hope the picture call doesnt take too long tonight. Hopefully no one will complain so we can get it done faster. Well, I think I'm going to go listen to my fun new CD in the living room or take a bubble bath..yum

      I think Ludacris has the coolest, most original lyrics sometimes. I also think I have insomnia. I just cant sleep very much anymore. it's fun, sometimes the hours go by like minutes. I did end up going shopping today, but I think I got a shirt that I dont like that much. Oh well, I'll wear it anyway maybe. I really liked this shirt that looks just like it at American Eagle, but it was $40. It was uber cute and probably worth it, because I ended up getting one almost exactly like it from Old Navy for $26.50. Yeah, i guess i'll keep it because I dont think Old Navy lets you return items. Its cool though. I watched The Assistant tonight. I love that show SO MUCH. Me and Sara called each other during every commercial break. It was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen. I want have Andy Dick's kids so bad just for the last name. Me and Sara have already named 4 of our 15 children we will have by him. (oh, and Say, the 5th one is "Amoeba"..hehehehehe). I have to work tomorrow. On Friday I had to babysit before the show and Emily was sick throwing up with a fever. So I hear she's still not feeling her best. I'mjust glad I didnt catch it with her right up under me all day. But after I get done at like 5:30, i've decided that I'm going to go out to eat with Sara and we're going table dancing. All I've got to say is..WE'RE FINDING BILLY DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whoa, I am so tired that I thought I jus saw a person running towards me out of the corner of my eye. Maybe I'm more tired than I think. But I am so going dancing soon. Something scandalous needs to happen lately. I'm not sure exactly what, actually I think i am exactly sure what. Yep, yep i am. Everyone's been getting scandalicious lately so I hear. I've been rubbing off and not doing it myself so I am definitely making up for it soon, very soon. I've decided to relate a part of my life to something other than a Dollar Store battery. Now its like a can of Pringles, once you start you cant stop. As in, once i start being retarded, i cant stop.. yeah,  retarded ..or something like that;)

      I have three days off from the show. I dont know what to do with myself. I think I may go shopping with Mom this afternoon after she gets home from her friend's birthday party. Rachel and Sara spent the night last night. We watched Drive Me Crazy at 4 in the morning. The guys came over to kill the raccoons. Didn't I write about those raccoons in my profile? I remember because that night they were scratching at the door. They are scary little things. But anyway, they didnt come last night, but I'm going to start setting them up for DEATH. hehehehehe. Well I thik I'm going to go eat lunch and get ready to go so I can go buy a new bathing suit.

      I hate secrets. I know just how to work this one, though. In fact, its not that big of a deal. I love it when people think they've put one past you and they actually havent and when they realize you've found out, they piss their pants but when they find out that you didnt have a stick shoved up your ass about it, it blows their mind. I love throwing people for a loop and keeping them on thier toes about me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by the way, for the last time, I CAN KEEP A SECRET. I'm not a little gossip fairy. If anything ever slipped out &amp; it seemed like it was my fault, (which sometimes it is, i will admit, i do screw up..a little..i know, i know, its hard being perfect) there's usually more to it and other people involved that put me in a bad position. So there, once and for all, b/c i'm sick of the 'big mouth' crap.

      I hate being me sometimes. I had an epiphany today on the golf course, where i was reminded of the fact that i can do whatever the hell i want. I had this awesome plan, and I actually had the balls to do it, but by the time I did, it was TOO LATE! I had the perfect oppurtunity too. BULLSHIT! Oh well, I guess I'll save my frustration for the next time I have a scandalicious agenda..I saw the hottie AGAIN today..He is so so cute. And by that time I was super glad I hadnt gone through with the little vision I had earlier. It may have been the sun messing with my mind..not really, i'm actually still pissed I didnt get to do it, because it was a hott little rendevous. Me and Sara did go shopping at the mall. We got new panties at Victoria's Secret and new clothes from AE and New Marine. Everyone was up at the mall today. We saw a bunch of people in FYE. We talked to Tobi about her summer. Then we saw Trey and he told us about all he'd done since today was his 18th birthday. He's such a funny guy. We saw a lot of people that we hadnt seen in a  while  though, it was fun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, my night tonight  almost  topped the day. I wish the people who tell me I shouldnt give my dad a hard time could have seen the little fit he threw tonight. I cant even explain it, and I dont want to. (if you want me to tell you about it, you can ask me, I just dont feel like going on forever.) It happens every once and a while and the man goes absolutely psycho. I just dont know whats been up lately. I have been playing this little card game for so long waiting for a good hand, and all i ever get dealt are the bad cards..

      I did something ULTRA RETARDED last night, but I cant help but laugh. Okay, when I'm home by myself, its not that boring because I'm used to being an only child and entertaining myself somehow. So, I was just doing my normal stupid stuff while listening to music and I thought, hey I wonder if I can still do a heel stretch, which is this little cheerleading thing you do when you fly and you hold your heel above your head. It's a fun stretch for the back of you thigh, so I did it like twice and I was like, HOLY SHIT, i'm still pretty flexible even though I havent been stretching everyday. So then I thought to myself, "I bet if you really stretch out good you can get your leg to go up really high." so I did it, I got down in a split and was really stretching my legs out good and I was ready to do it. So I pulled my leg up and..crack CRACK crack SNAP crack!..Holy Shit, that didnt feel too good..Maybe I wont do that anymore tonight. So I'm feelin it a little, and I went to bed about two and I wake up to go babysit for the kids and I try to get up and their is this sharp pain in my ass at the top of my thigh. It hurt so bad, I just fell back to sleep and didnt worry about taking a bath. When I finally got up I brushed my teeth and washed my face and I got REALLY light headed, like worse than when I passed out on those stack of chairs at Thespian Conference. I could only see blue splotches in my eyes and I was trying to find the couch, so I bumped into a chair, tripped over all this shit in my living room and fell into the side of the couch and pulled myself up and i was out. Ho-oh-oh-leeee shit. So I had to walk around like I had hip replacement surgery today, but I did get to lay out while making money, thats always a plus. Oh my gosh, I met this really really hott guy the other night. He was SO nice ( thats  definitely refreshing...). See, I knew who he was, but I had never met him before. So I am definitely going to have to see what he's all about. Well, I have to go get ready for this golf thing tomorrow..I dont think it will be any fun for some reason, and that reason is  i'm probably right.

      i am definitely not invasive. i hardly ever even approach a person unless their my friend. Yeah, but not only that, I MAY be a big mouth, i'm sorry about that, but shit, I'm not stupid. I know how to keep a fucking secret. I love being all mysterious about what I do and where I've been, so I dont just yell out something that happened to me. The only one time that anythingat nature has happened to me is when I kissed a guy, and I didnt tell anyone but my best friend. My other friend was there though, and she doesnt mind spilling things so on two occasions she put me in that position. I just get what the fuck has been up lately. Criticism has been coming from every direction lately. I'm really sorry and all, and a year ago if all of this had come up, I probably would have cried and tried to fake being&nbsp;someone else or actually change the way I acted, but not now. I think I've grown up enough to take it as constructive criticism and say fuck em all if they keep acting like they have a problem with me and keep giving me a hard time, because I have plenty of other friends and I've long been through with the days of trying to impress people. I am who I am. I love to have fun, and it sucks that it feels like I'm being punished because of a part of my personality that DOESNT EVEN FUCKING MATTER, because it doesnt even concern the situation, b/c i'm not fucking stupid when it comes to things like that. The thing that has happened lately doesnt bother me that bad, but if all of this little sneaking around keeps going on, there's going to be a change. I hate it when people think they've pulled a fast one on me, so I'll go hang out with some of my other friends I've missed this summer. I just hope that was a one time deal. I also hope people try to get to know me before they make assumsions about my character. Because three people, wait 4,&nbsp;have made these comments. One is full of bullshit, because I've had about 5 conversations with him and I never try to touch him b/c I'm not attracted to him at all. The second one kinda sucks because I know him pretty well, but I dont know where&nbsp;he gathered what he&nbsp;said from and he didnt even say it to my&nbsp;face,&nbsp;which made me feel like he was making assumptions. Oh well, I dont even care b/c its over. But the third guy told this same friend, but we're cool and it was just an offhanded comment, not in a mean way. And the fourth&nbsp;guy&nbsp;did say it to my face and all, and I'm not mad, but his deal wasnt even my fucking fault. He just misread something I said. Oh well, nothing I can do about&nbsp;it right now besides feel better about it now that I've thought it out and talked with this tiny bug, Henry, that is crawling across my kitchen floor. :) Anchorman was hirious. I will be quoting it for weeks...

      aaahhhh..I just took the best shower. Have you ever taken just a really good shower? Or maybe I'm just retarded, YYYYYAAAAAAAYYYYYY! I have had a really good day today. I got up about 1:27 this afternoon and sat in living room and read some of my summer work while I had my favorite food in the world peanut butter and pretzels. Then I went out and jogged for a little while and came back in and took my amazing little shower and now I'm sitting here in a towel being dumb. Eventful, right? Sara just called me, and she wants to do something tonight. I think we might go see Anchorman or something. But tts the only money I can spend this week, because I really need to buy some more new pants. Some that make my ass look really good. Maybe if I dont go to my grandma's anytime soon I'll lose a few more pounds. Three people commented on me losing more weight this summer at the show last weekend. I didnt even realize I had. I saw Brooke and Rynders a couple of weeks when i visited First Baptist and they said I looked smaller, so I think I may actually try to lose a little more if I've lost some without trying. I miss seeing everybody at school. Actually, I just miss goofing around in class &amp; making people laugh. its like I'm&nbsp;a different person in the summer. I've never been able to be myself around all the drama people, and when I did for like ONE WEEK this summer, a couple of my "friends" got all pissed and said all of this shit about me. So since then, I havent been being holding back from being crazy, fun Erin because they give me those snotty ass faces that make me want to ram a fucking stick up their ass. hehehehe, but now i feel its time I moved on since I dont give a shit what they think anymore and since they've moved on to criticize my two best friends &amp; what they're doing..I'm just sick of all this 8th grade shit. Girls will always be fucking retarded, I mean, I know I'm fucking retarded and I just try not to be, but I dont understand these girls that tell you your doing something wrong when they're jealous and then they go off being hypocritical and doing the same thing and think you dont notice. I just shake my head and laugh, because it'll bite them in the ass later (or that stick I have ready will bite them, either way). But anyway, that was all pointless and uninteresting to you since you probably have no idea what i'm talking about. Then again, most of the time no one really knows what I'm talking about. Well, I guess I'm going to wait around until Sara calls me back and tells me what we're doing tonight. I hope its something SCANDALICIOUS like i've been wanting, yum.

      I have been running around all day today. First I went to the set strike. I always hate those things, its kinda sad, but it wasnt that bad today. Then me and Sara were going to eat at Krystal's so we could talk about some stuff and we saw Joseph so he came to eat with us. Then we went over to Lisa and Emily's and hung out there for a few hours and then my mom picked me lisa and sara up and took us to eat AGAIN because my cousin wanted to see me. Yeah, I got the juice today. FINALLY. I cant name names or say specifics, but I am so proud and happy for her. Lol, I just cant believe it..But now that definitely means I'm next because she's covered all the bases that I've said I was going to cover with all that, and its going to happen now. But the deadline for this is next weekend, because we always do it in sequintial order, so I HAVE to get to it..Wow, I'm still in shock. I thought I would be the one...but i guess i havent had the oppurtunity lately. So, I guess I'll just find out this week, wont i?

      Yep, i was right..a total misunderstanding. That's good for my health. So there, world. Trying to dump all the shit on me, well it aint happenin. I'm just layin low not getting into any more drama before the trip. I dont think i'd be able to handle it emotionally. What I need is some good scandal. That can just get on its way ASAP because I was about ready to make a totally unexpected public scandal today, which would have probably been hott, but not such a great idea. I just thought I would let you know that what I said before was just me, as a girl, overreacting about dumb shit that girls do...Sorry, we girls are retarded, so any of you boys who want to come 'give me lessons' on how, um...not to be, um..retarded, or something like that ;) then come on, because i've always loved being teachers pet, and i can give you more than an apple...hehehe, sorry, its my dirty time of night, but there's no one to talk to besides Sara, but we're talking about toilets so...

      Well, my lucky streak has officially ended. Here comes the BULLSHIT truck ready to dump all of its glorious contents out on ME. Everything was going right socially and at home fot the most part. No one was talking bad about me so I didnt have to worry about backstabbers..but NO-HO-HO, i spoke a liiitle too soon, my friend. It all started when I found out that my great grandmother is probably going to die very soon, possibly while I'm out of the country. GRAND, another thing I get to look forward to when I get back to sleezburg...and besides the fact that I have been dreading the day she would die for the past few years. Now I feel this emmense amount of guilt for the fact that I may not be able to see her. Ugh, it just sucks. I didnt want to tell anyone tonight because I didnt want them thinking I was trying to get their sympathy, and besides I wanted to get my mind off of it. Well, maybe I should have gotten some fucking sypathy.. I am so fucking sick of girls. All girls are gossiping backstabbers, its a stereotype but its the truth. Even I do it. But my God, i just wasnt up for anyone's shit tonight. First of all, I have no problem AT ALL with Kim, Lisa, Amanda, Emily, or Laura, although I am a little disappointed right now..But Lacy best watch her step, because she tells me she wants to make sure everythings "okay" between us and that I'm not mad, but then she'll go talk shit and lie about me behind my back. I've let it slide the past few weeks like after the golf tournament because I'm just getting to old for this petty shit and people like her can go screw themselves because i'm SICK OF IT. And yes, my skirt is short, and yes, i was asking for it from Davis, but if i really cared i wouldnt have worn it. I know how girls are, but WHAT WAS I THINKING when i thought my fucking friends would be nice to me. But I see Kim, Lisa, Lacy, and Amanda dancing around outside on the loading dock like "ha ha ha! they just got it." I mean, how bitchy. Then, get this, when we come outside, they have the NERVE to ask us if we want to go eat with them. This has got to be straightened out immediately. I'm not going to do the girl thing here and let it just build up, I'm going to talk to the people I really care about clearing things up with, but screw the rest of them. I really want to make things right with Kim and Lisa (why was  Lisa  backstabbing me.. that  hurts the most.) I guess its just because I have built this really honest friendship with Sara and Rachel (and Lisa was in it too, actually, this whole thing could be a misunderstanding.) telling each other everything and not being involved in all of the gossiping and talking about people when they're not there to defend themselves, so it's just weird being on the other side of their antics. I'm just getting too old for this. It's cool, it'll work out. Like Sara and I said, we'll try to make sure everything's cleared up, but if people are still giving us shit, its their deal because the second we get on that bus to Atlanta, all of our problems are out of the window. Scotland in 3 days!! On a different, more awesome note: someone has been really hott lately. Tonight I nearly peed on myself...I have never wanted to go at it as bad as I wanted to tonight. I was ready to do something insane with someone tonight. Maybe it was good I didnt...NAH, it wasnt, i'd leave right now if the oppurtunity presented itself! hehehe!

      I have been in a super silly mood tonight. I kept on falling all over the place like I was drunk today while I was babysitting. I was totally out of it. I woke up all light headed I guess from lack of sleep and I think I took a shower while I was still asleep.. Oh God, I hope I wasnt just dreaming, I HOPE i bathed today.. Oh well! Nah, I'm positive i did, because my hair was wet all day. So anyway, I was super light headed, and I figured, oh i have plenty of time to get ready so I'm just gonna let my head quit pounding and wait until these blue spots in front of my face go away, so I laid down on the bathroom floor and so I brushed my teeth while I was laying there and I did my whole routine from the floor. It was kinda cool. Man, tonight was some kind of funny after practice. I went out to eat with the girls, and I was just crackin up. I could not even breathe I was laughing so hard at all the crap that happened. It was cool. I hadn't hung out with the girls in a while.

      I feel like this week is already off to a bad start. I woke up not really caring&nbsp;if I did anything&nbsp;and I think I ended the day with people thinking I was desperate to do something with them, and that's not the case. I dont want anyone thinking I'm some typical needy girl whose desperate to do things all the time, because I'm not, but I'm scared that I come off that way. I'm not one of those psycho bitches,like the girl I dealt with all this weekend, who thinks that they own a guy because she screwed around with him. I'm sorry, but that is a prime example of a stupid girl. If you are pretending to just want to have fun, but really have some aort of agenda to tie some poor guy up, then you're just screwing yourself over. But then there are those guys that do really annoying things. Okay, just because they have dealt with the desperate little "call you every 5 minutes, down your back 24/7" kind of girls I have described, doesnt mean you have to treat every girl like that just to protect yourself from having baggage to deal with. I mean, what ever happened to screwing around, having fun, and still hanging out being friends? I dont know why things always have to be weird, its almost like you want things to get boring and go sour. I dont understand it, so there. Thats all I got...

      aahhh...i just found my Phantom Planet CD. I love that song. It's so sweet. I had a very interesting week this week. A lot of fun, but very interesting. I am so SO SO excited about Scotland. It's so surreal that we leave in just a little over a week. I'm almost sad to go because that means the whole experience is over. It's just been such a long road to travel this past year. Its been awesome though. Its super rewarding to have worked hard for something like this, rather than to have just have someone write me a big check. I can't believe we are fxing to leave! I have so much stuff to take care of, like finishing Sophie's World, and reading about England and Scotland. AAAHHHH! Well, thats all I've got right now.
