      Good Day,  Hope all is well with you fine people of the world.   Lets get to the good - Recording the other night went well.  We recorded "Walking You Home" and we also recorded this jam/disco kinda song...Dave and I were just messing around and I got on this riff and he came in with this disco beat and we were jammin...oh shooooot..We aren't a Phish band but we were a jam band for a good 15 mins!  our show last night had a great turnout we had about 15 people come for us which for us is the biggest crowd we have played for as band...haha pretty bad, but it was cool!  We have to give a special thanks to our most dedicated fans Tom & Rachel!  Thanks for coming to almost all our shows you guys are getting so much good karma for it!!! We the band played an ok show, we were a bit sloppy with the lyrics and music.  I couldn't get my guitar in tune for the last song b/c my tuner went AWOL...so that was a bit of a downer for me and the rest of the band that we couldn't fully finish the set...but but but other than that we had a fun time playing and we are trying to continually improve onstage...ahhh that was cheesy I sound like that guy who does those self help tapes who was on that movie Shallow Hal  We don't have another gig for about a month so until then its alot of practice and recording.  Peaceout and make sure you buy tickets to the ben lee  urlLink   show on june 16 at tt the bears in cambridge, ma - he is a great singer/songwriter.  naturally yours, gregg

      Yo Yo Yo!  We The Predicates (Gregg, Erica & Dave) have been recording for a couple months now...We have about 4 songs done so far with another 7 to do.  We decided to add one more song onto the albumby Dave's request.  The song is an old song Erica and I wrote like 2 years ago, its called "We Talk In Code" We decided to record it after messing around with it in practice a couple weeks ago.  Dave added drums to it and now its a rawking rawk song! We also now include it in our live set.  Our next show is tomorrow at The Blackstone in Cumberland, RI (The music capital of the world) and alot of people have said they will go, but we shall see how that goes...  I will post again at the end of this week and let you all know how the show went and how recording went this week.  love,  gregory shane

      Merry new days of Summer,  First just a quick side note - Last week's Ben Lee show that I told you all to go to was very good.  He is a terrific performer and interacts with crowd wonderfully.  He played an acoustic with just himself and electric with his whole band.  Ben  mixed it up quite nicely!  Go buy his new record  "Hey You, Yes You" @ amazon.com  We played a show last night at the Lucky Dog in Worcester, MA.  It was kind of an open mic thing for bands.  The music genres ranged from acoustic hippie rock to rap. The rappers were actually quite funny.  They were from Manchester, NH and they acted like thugs.  I can see if they were form NYC or even Boston or some big city but for crying out loud they are from Manchester, NH.  They were singing about killing people and hooking up with chicks.  I guess Manchester, NH is not the sleepy New England town we all thought it was.    The stage we played on looked like it was from the 80's hair metal scene.  The whole venue was actually like that.  The bathrooms had naked girls all over it.  It is a very cheesy place and I doubt we will ever try and play their again.  The drum kit Dave used was mad old and sounded like crap and the stack I was playing thru was garbage!  Overall it was a pretty bad night.  I had a cold so I sounded like Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer form that claymation movie where they put the black stuff over his nose so it doesnt glow but it makes him sound all nasley when he talks, Dave was weak b/c he didn't eat all day, and Erica was Erica -  3 beers and 5 bathroom trips later she was ready to rawk!  Our next show is July 22 @ The Blackstone in Cumberland and I am supposed to be having a good amount of people I work with show up at the show.    Content and flamboyant,  Gregg

      Greetings Predicatizens,  We are all well and healthy as ever as a band.  We celebrated Erica's birthday this past Saturday.  We went for dinner at Cassarino's in Providence and to Mohegan Sun Casino.  It was a good time had by all, but we all lost $$$. Even the non-social infamous by song title anyways Zdenek Janda and his wonderful wife went.  Please feel free to wish Erica a happy birthday by emailing her at eputis@comcast.net  Dave and I started to re-record the album again.  He finished 6 drums tracks and he has 5 more to do and then its onto the guitar and bass parts.  Then vocals and then we are done...haha so give us about 2 years before its done.  We have been coming up with some album names for the new record and we are going to choose 5 and then we will have you guys vote for the one you like best and the album name that has the most votes will be our album name. After the album is finished we are also going to get some tshirts and stickers made up so you the Predicatizens can be the few, the proud, the predicatizens!  On a side note-The Predicates will be attending the Ben Lee show at TT The Bears in Cambridge, MA on Wednesday June 16. You should attend it if you can.  Ben Lee is a singer-songwriter form the land down under Australia and he used to date Claire Danes.  He puts on a great show and he has terrific songs.  He was a big influence on me when I started writing songs.  If you'd like to check him out his website is    urlLink Ben-Lee.com   It's Spicccccccccccceeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyyy gregg

      And we're back!!! haha  Yo Yo Yo, sup Yo?  We just played a show at the sky bar last night.  They have a completely new stage and the sound equipment is now in all the right places so it sounds good and looks really good.  We brought in 6 people which isn't too bad but the club kinda complained that it wasn't 10 - but what do they expect from a band as cute and pretty as us! hah We played our usual set except we took out "Complacent" and replaced it with "Taco Bell"  I really enjoyed the way Taco Bell sounded with drums in it.  It gives our set a bit of a different sound...it's the curveball... We got a really good response from a few people there including the band that played after us  urlLink Chocolate Milk   As far as recording our new untitled album, we decided to start form scratch.  The reason being is because the recording quality wasnt all that great b/c we werent using a compressor...so now Dave aka our drummer is going to buy a compressor this week or next and we will start re-recording our songs again.  It's not too bad since we werent very far into the recording process...  We are trying to book some shows in Connecticut and New York City...hopefully we will setup shows in both places...more shows in Rhode Island, and maybe some north of Boston like in Salem.    After all that we've been thru I will make it up to you...I'm sorry tooo...haha a little Peter Cetera for all you freaks...I hope you and wish the best of the world for you and your loved ones...sleep easy knowing that I - Gregg O'Connell am probably at this very moment napping away! done done done  peace 'n summertime gso

       Hello People!   So, we had our show at The Blackstone on Thursday and it went really well. I think it was our second best show and Dave thought it was our best. Dave and Erica & I got alot of compliments on our performances. Dave was hitting as hard as ever and you should have seen the fan blowing his groovy blonde hair everywhere. He looked like a young Dave (David) Hasselhoff. Erica sang beautifully and was owning the stage like a coherent Whitney Houston. The turnout was spectacular. We had a bunch of people I work with, some of my friends, Erica had a friend there and so did Dave.   Erica and I will be playing an acoustic show this coming Saturday in Franklin, MA @ Mel Diva’s.   After that show we don't have any scheduled since Dave is going to Germany for the month of August.       Erica and I have been writing a couple new songs that'll probably be on the album after this one that we are recording.   I let Dave listen to some of them and he is very optimistic about how they are turning out and he feels it’s some of the best stuff we have written.   Not to be outdone by Dave "Hasselhoff" Tuetkens compliment he writes some of the most beautiful mind trancing indie rock music.   His website  urlLink www.hermanthegreat.com  which for now points to The Predicates website will soon have his solo album there for purchase.    If you can make it to our acoustic show Saturday please feel free to go.   It's free and we will be playing for like 1-hour 30-45 mins so it’s going to be a long show.     Album Recommendations by Gregory Shane O'Connell     Nada Surf  - Let Go   (Everybody in the band is enjoying this album - kind of a cross between Coldplay and Death Cab For Cutie       Finley Quaye  - Much More Than Love   (really good vocals, terrific single "Dice" and the album has a great mix of reggae, pop rock, and singer songwriter material...     Thanks for listening to my ramble.    Sleep well and easy until I write again,    gregg

      What up kids?  Hopefully all of you are good and healthy because the The Predicates are a busy bunch of people writing and recording!   First and foremost the new Predicates album is coming along very slowly.  We have start recording over 3 times already due to Dave buying new recording equipment so that we can get the best possibly sound for our record.  Dave polished off 7 songs on the drums last week and he will finish the rest tomorrow.  After that we lay down the guitar parts, then bass then vocals.    We won't be playing any shows or recording in August due to the fact that Dave will be in Germany and the rest of Europe basically the whole month.  In other related Dave news, Dave Tuetken AKA Herman The Great will be releasing a solo album.  He has the whole thing written and recorded and just needs to lay down his vocal tracks.  The sound is alot like a heavier Jimmy Eat World in my opinion.  It sounding great and it will definitely be a great rock record!  Also releasing a solo album to be bundled with Dave's solo album will be my solo album.The title of my album will be "The Best Player on the Team" and it will include anywhere between 5-8 and songs.  I've got about 3 down so far and skeletons to the rest. My album will be acoustic, with some synth, drums, and drum machines.  Dave and I thought of releasing them together as double album kind of a joke but when we thought about it we thought it to be a good idea. So you will be able to get two albums for basically the price of one.  We will be selling it on CDBaby.com and digitally thru itunes.com come this Fall 2004.  Dave and I will not be playing any shows solo, we are just going to record our albums and send them to magazines for reviews and sell it online. Not to worry but The new Predicates record should be completed Fall 2004/Winter 2004.  Stay safe and in tune to The Predicates world around you!  Falling from grace, Gregg

      Dear Fellowship of The Predicates,  Dave and I have been recording guitar tracks for the new album. We have a great guitar sound going. Really crunchy clean, like Cap'n Crunch cereal (Sweet, Crunchy & wonderfully tasting) We recorded like 5 guitar parts. This past Saturday when we were recording "Gay Boyfriend" we got to the very end of the track and as I hit the last chord what happens you ask? I break a string halting recording until Dave gets back in September. The way things are going with the guitar parts we should have all the music done for the album in September and Finish most if not all of the vocals in September as well. Which means there is a good chance we could get this album out by October. It'll probably work more into November since we want to mix it really good and we are going to press this album.  That's all for now my little darlings...below are some fun things to do, read, and listen to while we are  away.   Recommendations :   websites :  urlLink www.shortnews.com  - real news, but the weird stuff thats not on the frontpage.  urlLink www.itunes.com  - the best way to buy music digitally, such a cool fun website with tons of exclusive content only available here.   music :  My Morning Jacket  -  It Still Moves :  hippie rock n roll without the hippie garbage.  A ton of reverb that makes you feel like your dreaming for 60 minutes.  Travis - The Invisible Band:   Erica &amp; I love this album, its such a pretty, relaxing feel good album!  thank you - love my other half... gregg

      Greetings Guys & Girls,  August is so not a busy month at all for us musically. It is busy for our personal lives though. Erica and I will be doing alot of booking for gigs for September, October, November this month. We are going to try to get gigs in Providence, CT, and NY &amp;  Chicago  (via our friends in  urlLink www.marizen.com ) Dave "Hasselhoff" Tuetken will be going to  Germany and the rest of Europe  for almost all of August.  That means no practices,  and no gigs.  It'll be nice taking a bit of a  break  since we have been practicing every week and play gigs as a full band since February 2004. Erica has been learning bass and at a quick rate at that. She has grown leaps and bounds as a bassist. She is scheduled to play gigs with us as a bassist in Fall/Winter 2004. The month of August for me means I am going to  NYC  with a friend for the first time in my life. I've never been to the "Big Apple" I am not a big fan of city life. The hussle and bussle of it all gets me stressed out. I am more of a surburbia boy.  Our show at Mel Divas turned pretty good.  Our friend  urlLink Steve Lamontagne   opened the show for us.  He and his friend who I can't remember her name played an excellent folky 30 minute set. Steve wowed the girls in the audience with his Jimi Hendrix style guitar work and his Bob Dylan esque voice. His friend had a beautiful folk voice and also played guitar wonderfully. Our drummer Dave who has never liked coffeehouse gigs wasn't too keen or excited on us playing at another coffeehouse, but after he played guitar with us during the gig he became a believer in the faith of coffee housing. He played his electric guitar and really played his little heart out that night. He really enjoyed our new set closing song "Once Again" He said the new song Erica and I wrote reminds him alot of Husker Du's early work. When we play the song live as a full band, Dave is going to jump off the drums and pick up his electric guitar and add soem noise filled feedback guitar sounds to it. Erica sang like an angel yet again that night. Erica has so much potential as a singer not only for rock music but also jazz. She's also a terrific songwriter, and even though I come up with the songs whatever she adds to it lyrics, harmonies, melodies and other ideas it always turns out being alot better than anything I would do completely on my own. We really complement each other well when we write songs. I can also see Dave joining in on the songwriting process more extensively in the future as well. Some of the guitar stuff he comes up with is incredible, but its also too hard for me to play hah. He is the best musician in the group and we are so happy he is the band. Wow I sound like a big suck up haha...   Album Recommendations by The Predicates:    Dave Tuekten recommends:   Ryan Adams - Love is Hell:  "Its a b-sides album but it is some of his best stuff"    Erica Putis recommends:   Toby Lightman - Little Things:  "She sings awesome"    Gregg O'Connell recommends:    Her Space Holiday - The Young Machines:  "Electropop with sweet easy going beats &  scandalous lyrics"    The next time I write we should have a bunch of new gigs lined up and be ready to rawking!  Wishing you were here, Gregg  P.S.  We recorded about half of our set this past Friday.  If anyone wants a copy it'll only play on your computer but I can mail a copy to anyone interested in it.  Send me an email at info@thepredicates.com
