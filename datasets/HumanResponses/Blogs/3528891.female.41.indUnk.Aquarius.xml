      May 31, 2004  It's time to move on.  Being here was good.  I've dumped the stress, recharged my batteries, seen my siblings and now need to move.   It wasn't as tearful as NH.  I think because I don't see them all the time, plus I know I will see them again.  By then, all of us will be different.  Stopped at Niagara Falls.  I haven't been there since the summer Bidi (our exchange student from France) lived with us.  Tom and the kids had never been there.  We made Sean do some reading on the Falls and then math problems.  It wasn't as big as I remembered, but still awe inspiring.  We first saw fog swirling around.  I didn't think too much about it because it was raining.  We almost bagged it because of the rain, but didn't know when we would be in the area again?    When you get out of the car you became aware of a low rumbling noice.  As we walked on, getting wetter and wetter, the low rumble became a dull thunder.  We first saw the river on our left.  The flow was rapid and sent a chill down my spine thinking of one of the kids falling in.  If you looked forward you saw the earth fall away and the decible of the the rumble  again increased.  Looking over the edge you saw the water tumble over the cliff, sending white mist out while forming a green veil that covered the rocks behind it.  It was beautiful.  The maiden of the Mist was circling below.    She looked small and frail compared to the Falls.  I imagine the sound echoing off of the cliffs on either side, must have been deafing to the people on the boat.  From Niagara Falls we headed into Canada.   The landscape was testbook perfect of the Canadian plains.  Flat, with field after field of swaying wheat, and remote farm houses. Crossing into Canada wasn't a problem.  But we learned that returning to the USA wasn't going to be as easy.  The returning line at five o'clock on Memorial Day must have been 2 miles long.  I tried to keep positive playing geography games and giving the kids candy for correct answers to questions.  It still took two hours to go the few miles to cross the Ambassador bridge from Windors, Canada into Detroit, Michigan.  The wait in line through costoms was hard for the kids, but for the most part they did really well being in the car today.  We only went 426 miles but it took a long time.  Let's see how well they are tomorrow.

      May 26, 2004  	The house is starting to empty out.  There have been several strong thunderstoms over the last few days.  When the thunder rolls the house REALLY vibrates now.  There are  a lot of emotions ready to boil over.  I tend to suppress them, to deal with them just seems overwhelming.  I am afraid that it would paralyze me and I won't get the 300 things on my "must do today" list done.  	  How do you say good bye to a house that you've raised your children in.  Devin and Kelly were babies here.  There is no wall or floor that we haven't touched.  The house isn't just echoing from being empty, there are echos a toodler's laugh, little girls dressed up and giving "fashion shows" and plays, evenings sitting by the fire with the lights off making up stories.  Squeals of delight on Christmas morning, fights over who gets to play with that toy.  Whispers late into the night from friends sleeping over.  And off course there is "Trevor get down"  "Mike, get up" and "Shelby, STOP BREATHING"  And lately, the music cranked loud and the family dancing before the kids go off to school.  That is our new coping skill.  The emotions are too raw to talk about so we dance instead.  With the music loud to drown out the fear and little voices who are telling us we are making a mistake.   I wish I could be a fly on the wall twenty years from now when our kids are in therapy and they tell the pyschologist that one.  We have a little over 48 hours before the kids go to school for the last time.  How do you send your kid to school, knowing he won't have a home to come back to.  What in the hell are we doing?  5/28/04 	  	Today is the day.  The house is still far from being ready and I have a pit in my stomach.  I don’t think it is from the anxiety of what we are doing.  Today it is from the people who are buying the house.  They have already bought the house, this is just a formality since we rented back for a week.  Are they going to cause last minute problems and try to keep the security deposit?  I really wish we hadn’t given it to them.  But I guess I need to file that under life lessons and know that I won’t do that again. 	Had breakfast with Trish this morning.  Earlier I was thinking that I should cancel, but when I went to call, the phone was disconnected.  It must have been God intervenning because Trish is so positive that my whole attitude had changed.  By the time we finished breakfast I was excited and ready to start the adventure.  These new feelings lasted until I returned home and saw all of the work that still needed to be done. 	Amazingly we finished everything just in time for them to come.  I couldn’t believe it when they walked in, Lori gave me a hug.  Tom was gracious and explaining everything to her.  The tension wasn’t as bad as we had anticipated.  She had made the comment that things looked good and I thought that was going to be that.  Then she started to walk away.  She started inspecting everything on every floor.  The rugs upstairs still smelled from the multiple use by shelby.  Once again, God intervened on our behalf.  The realtor had stepped in dog poop and had tracked it upstairs, masking the smell.  It was just so sweet seeing it on white carpeting.  While Shirley washed her shoes, Lori went back to the basement.  After a few minutes I went down there.  There was some water down there .  My best guess was that because of the rain, the bulk head had leaked and ran out onto the basement floor.  Then the tension level had increased.  Lori was on the phone with her husband asking what to do.  Our feeling was that we had disclosed the leak, they had an inspection,  waived their rights to ask for anything else, and signed the final papers.  The walkthrough today was just to make sure we didn’t put any holes in the walls or left trash everywhere.  We told her our feelings and that we were on a time sheduled.  It was time to move on. 	I know that buying and selling a house is just a messy and traumatic ordeal.  I think that it would be very different if we were able to just talk to each other instead of through a realtor.  In the end I feel both sides feel like they were the ones who gave up the most.  Now it is time to just put in in the past where it belongs and move forward. (Reality is Tom and I will talk about it all the way across the US.)  May 28, 2004  By three o'clock all we wanted to do is get out of the state.  Leaving the school and friends who have worked there and helped us along this journey of raising kids was hard.  These were the hardest good-byes.  These were the people who I could call no matter what.  How many times did Kate Stohr help us?  How can you ever repay them?  I do worry at times, who will be my support system?  Have I been a good enough friend for them to feel a loss in their support system?  Maybe with Fletchers and Blairs?  I could feel the tension dissolving the closer we got to mom and dad's.  I was nice to be able, even for a few minutes revert back to being a kid, with someone else who will make the decisions.  How ironic that the place I couldn't wait to get away from and see the world was the place I wanted to run to when I was on my way.  The mileage to here was 272 miles.  29 May 2004 The air here feels clearer.  Maybe because of all of the rain they have been having.  It feels just like it did when I was a kid.  Soft.  Full of different but very delicate smells.  Walking out back a caught a wiff of Lilac.  Yet when I went hunting for the source I couldn't find it.  The smell of the dirt, recently worked. The barn had the smell I remember grandpa's barn having.  Not a smell of cow manure  more a smell of an old forgotten place.  A place that has lived it's life and is now resting.  Trying to decide if it wants to get busy and work again or slowly decay back into the land.  It is a comfortable smell - no wonder the kids liked to come down here to play.  Dad is now seventy and still working harder than a lot of twenty year olds I know.  You can tell that his back is hurting him.  Mom continues to be very sharp mentally, although I worry about her ability to get around.  I hope that the people who are planning on buying the farms just does it.  I know they won't quit working, but a least they won't have that hanging over their heads and the future may be a bit clearer for them.  Who knows, if Dad finds himself out of debt for the first time in 40 years and money in the bank, maybe he would work on his woodworking instead.

         Over the next few months we continued to try various places in New Zealand. We looked at Napier, Invercargill, and Rororua.  For one reason or another the jobs always fell apart, either because after the interview they said Tom would need to work nights or issues with MOSS ( something to do with non-New Zealanders and supervision).   	In the meantime, we had received an offer on the house and had entered the inspection and negotiation phase of selling.  It had turned somewhat sour and we were trying to decide if we had wanted to sell at all due to the lack of job in NZ.  Finally, we had reached the conclusion that sometimes to find your way you must close your eyes and walk through the darkness.  We signed the final agreement.  Within several hours Tom received a phone call telling him about the job in Tasmania.  With the house sold and a job offer in hand we thought the hard part was done.  Little did we know that we were just beginning to start.  Both Tom and I were required to be finger printed and have them sent off for FBI checks, every possible document related to Tom's education (including a letter from Tom's high school stating he was taught in English) and post medical school training had to be notarized and sent.  All five of us had to have physicals, chest xrays, and Tom had to prove he was disease free.    All of them had to be sealed and signed by the doctors doing the physicals.  If the Australian govt.  thought we had touched them we may be denied a visa.

      We moved to New Hampshire from California 10 years ago.  We were only suppose to be there for 5 years but life got away.  We started talking about leaving in the winter of 2003.  Our thought was to go back to the west coast.  We spent three weeks that summer driving up and down the pacific coast looking at different towns we thought we would like to live.  Tom had lined up a couple of job interviews; although none were in the towns we liked.  In the end we thought we could live in Eugene,OR and Tom could commute to Florence.  He would only have to work 6 days a month.  (That is  (6) 24 hour shifts.)  Still he would have time to take classes at OSU and get out of medicine.  The only thing was - when he interviewed they had led us to believe they had an opening, when we got home - the job had evaporated.  We put the idea on hold while we got the kids settled in school, got back into work and Tom trained for another marathon.  A few months later, on a warm, clear October day, Tom joined me for lunch in Brattleboro.  The director in Florence had e-mailed and let him know that the job was available and his for the taking.  I clearly remember looking across the Conn. River and on to the hills of New Hampshire, wondering what do we each want out of this?  Is this where we are truly headed?  I could vision my list of the 50 things I want to do before I die.  It had been almost a year since I had crossed anything off that list.  Tom was concerned about working not only 24 hour shifts, but six night shifts a month.  (Night shifts were becoming unbearable.  He had been doing them since he was 16 and at the age of 52 he had certainly done his share.  Not only did it take him 2 days after the shift to recover, he was now losing the day before the shift due to being short and withdrawn.  That is a lot of time lost when you are doing 3-4 a month) The idea of moving felt like we were going to be jumping off a cliff.  I asked Tom, "If we are going to jump off a cliff, why not make it a big one and keep going west?"  He gave me the perplexed look of "What the hell is west of the Oregon coast?"  Yet it all made sense.  Even before we were married we had talked about taking our children and living in another country.  We wanted them to know and understand the whole world and not just their little part of it.  The kids were at perfect ages, somewhere between diapers and high school.  If we didn't do it now, the kids would become too old and we would be stuck where ever we were until Kelly turned 18.  On Tom's birthday, November 1, he showed up in my office and announced that he had given his six months notice that was required by the group's bylaws.  This was not my husband!  He quit his job without having a firm or even a soft job offer!  What happened to the triple cross referencing before starting on a  project?  And he is sitting there smiling at me!!  I could vaguely focus enough after the shock to hear him say something about "being scared" and "feeling alive".  I was feeling a little out of my element because he always did the thorough planning.  Now I knew I needed to keep my eye on him.  Over the next few months we had contacted two different headhunters who place medical people in the New Zealand area.  We had settled on New Zealand for several reasons.  First, they speak English.  This was going to be a major advantage in selling the idea to the kids.  Second, we spend three weeks on the south island before we were married and fell in love with it.  I can remember standing in Dunedin and saying that I could live there.  Lastly, we thought more people would visit us there and anywhere else.  In December had to make several important decisions about how are we going to do this.  The first was which company to go through.   We decided to go with Global Medical Staffing out of Salt Lake City.  Cheryl seemed to be the most responsive and patient with our 9 million questions and need of hand holding.   The second decision seemed much more important.  Do we keep our house and just rent it out or do we sell it?  We spent a lot of time seeking out people who had gone overseas, both in the medical field and in other industries.  None of them had sold their home.  Everyone had a place to come back to.  A place that they knew was there waiting for them.  We had a fifteen year mortgage so the monthly payment was high.  We could refinance and most likely cover the mortgage.  However, we felt like this chapter was over.  Why chance renting the house?  Yes, most likely the renter would destroy the house.  But what about the sensitive septic system?  Would they decrease the amount of soap in the dishwasher?  Would they limit the amount of laundry they do in a day?  We had put a lot of sweat and love into this house.  Would they take care of the hard would floors we had put in?  In the end, we  felt like it was better to let it go.   We put the house on the market in February.  Still a lile unsure if we were going o sell or not.  We looked at several different areas in New Zealand.  Napier on he north island, Invercargill on the south island, and finally Rotorua on the north island.  For some reason hey always seemed to fall apart for some reason or another.  Mostly because we had agreed that Tom wasn't going to be doing any more nights.   We had received an offer on the house and had an interview with Rotorua, NZ.  I felt like everything was falling into place.  Then the inspections started and the people who wanted the house started demanding things.  The interviewer wanted to pay less and wouldn't promise that Tom wouldn't have to work nights.  We had to break things into parts.  Selling the house needed to be independent of going overseas.  Thisn part of our lives was closing and in order to move on we had to sell the house.  Once we were able to say and believe that it was easier to sign the papers.  A few hours after we signed Tom received a phone call from Global Medical.  There was a position in Burnie, Tasmania  that was looking for a ER doc to do days and a few evenings.

      June 2, 2004  We are in Chicago. (337 miles)  Tom got a great deal through priceline and we are staying at the Palmer House in the Loop district.  The kids loved the main lobby.  The ceiling was painted beautiful pictures (Sean was quick to note the that people were naked).  All of them felt like they were in the movie "Anastasia" when they were walking down from the balcony on the grand staircase.  So of course we had to do it several times a day!  Spent some time seeing the John Hancock building, the science museum, and various other shops and buildings.  I was impressed with the kids - since we lived in a very white NH, I was afraid of them making comments about the skin color of others.  I guess we did get them out often enough because they never said anything about it.  We did have some long conversations about beggars and when do you give and when you don't.  It was a difficult concept to get across.  They have always seen us giving money every month to different charities, donated food and clothing to the homeless shelter and Joan's pantry.  "Why don't you want to give that man with the bottle any money?"  They really make you stop and question yourself - am I teaching them to be giving or am I teaching them to be judgmental?  We visited with some friends of Tom's that he hadn't seen since college.  They are very impressive and I felt like we aren't doing anything great by going to Tasmania.  I am not completely sure of the dates, but they were in Nicaragua in the 80's providing health care.  (he is a physician and she is a PA)  They later went to southern Mexico and provided more health care there.  They we living in an area that didn't even have electricity!  Their two oldest children we going to school and being taught in Spanish!  She told the story of how  it took "forever" to get into a store when they returned, because the children were in awe of the automatic door openers.  Each one would need to take their turn at standing on the area that would trigger the door to open, allow it to close before repeating the process for the next child.  My hat is off to them!  5 June 2004  We left Chicago and blitz over to visit Karen's aunt and uncle (621 miles).  It was wonderful to see Martha and hear some of the family skeletons.  But we were able to talk to Uncle Al for the first time about his experiences during world war ll.  I never knew he was on Omaha Beach on D-day.  He was also in the heart of the Battle of the Bulge.  He didn't say a lot, however the look in his eyes spoke volumes......  6 June 2004  Made it to Colorado Springs.  (another 650 + miles day)  The kids I think are doing better than we are with the traveling.  They love listening to the book on tape.  I need to thank RJ Rowlings for making the fifth Harry Potter book so long.  I think when we finally finish it will be over 24 hours of listening.  We will usually drive for a couple of hours and then when they start to get restless we will put on a cd and there is silence in the car.  They continue to do math and geography in the mornings when we are driving.  They also are writing in their journals (I think - they asked me not to read them so as far as I know they may just be drawing).  The scenery outside the car window changed from gentle rolling hills in eastern Kansas to the flat, baron land of western Kansas.   Tonight we go our first real glimpse of the Rookies.  These are real mountains and not the hills of NH.  I can spend hours just looking at the snow caps.  I don't think you could ever grow tired of looking at them.  Especially when it is hot outside in the middle of summer and you can look up and see snow.  It was a beautiful sunset, full of soft pinks, warm oranges and brilliant reds.  8 June 2004 We crossed through part of the Rookies Mountains and camped in the eucalyptus grove last night.  I was amazing we made it.  When we were getting the house emptied and sorting what goes and what stayed we would casually threw in stuff we thought we might need.  We never went through our standard camping check list.  We did have our tent, unfortunately it is about nine years old and is showing it's age.  The fly will disintegrate whenever you touch it.  Tom didn't think it was going to rain so tonight we are going without a fly.  One of the tent poles was busted.  So we McGyvored it with the tire iron and some duct tape.  The kids had fun exploring the area.  Sean especially seems at home here.  After breakfast he hiked up about 1000 feet to a point that seemed to have some caves.  I can identify some of the plants, yucca, sage,and eucalyptus.  It seems to be a transitional place with some desert, some alpine, and some that I thought only grew with a lot of water. I think it reminds me just how little I know about the different environments.  11 June 2004 Moved deeper into the southwest corner of Colorado and spent two nights camped at about 10,000 feet.  There was snow next to the tent.  We had stopped and bought a new tent which turned out to be a good thing.  Although it didn't rain the fly did help to keep the heat in.  Everyone had to sleep with sweats, three shirts, two pairs of socks and a hat on.  And there was times it was still cold.  There was a river about ten feet from the tent.  It was a beautiful place to pitch a tent, however the constant sound of running water wasn't helpful when you woke in the middle of the night needing to go to the bathroom.  It was toooooo cold to go outside and pee.  We hiked higher and found an alpine meadow.  Sitting on the rocks with the warmth of the sun on my shoulders and a cool breeze on my face I realized my mind was quiet for the first time in years.  There was no twitting about the past, no to-do-list, no worring about the future.  All that mattered was the here and now.  Oh how I would love to stay in this moment.  Even the kids seem to be a peace.  At least they are not fighting.  Each seems to be wrapped up in their own imaginations, playing in the forest or by the water.  16 June 2004 We drove hard through the desert (and he four corners).  At one point after we had crossed through the four corners into Arizona we pasted through a sandstorm.  Although it wasn't a strong one we saw dust devils and the sand stung anywhere that your skin was exposed.  We arrived at 9 pm in Paradise Valley.  I was nice to be at Tom's mom's and to take a warm shower before crawling into a comfortable bed.  The temps have been in the 100's so the kids are enjoying Uncle Tim's pool.    We still have not received the FBI clearance.  The Australian govt. will not grant a work visa without it.  Doubts as to whether this is going to happen are lingering and we are making plan B.  Is it a sign?  I don' know, but we keep going back to the decision we made when we were centered.  Going was what we wanted when we were in a good place.  18 June 2004 I can't believe the last twenty-four hours.  We had to make a decision.  We had received the clearance and forwarded them on to the Australian Govt.  The person who was to approve our visa was first out sick and then didn't get to it.  It is now the weekend over there and we are scheduled to leave on Sunday.  Do we go ahead to Fiji and maybe have to turn back at our own expense or do we sit tight until Monday and forfeit the money we had already spent to save our reservations in Fiji?  Global was reluctant to approve their spending the money to pay for Tom and my ticket.  Tom had spoken to Adrian at Global and told her he would call back in five minutes to tell her what we wanted to do.  We talked and had decided that we were going to take the chance and fly on to Fiji at our own expense and they could reimburse us if the visa was approved.  In that five minutes Adrian had called the travel agency and told her to cancel everything and reschedule them for two days later including the reservations that we made and were paying for ourselves.  She canceled without checking availability of flights on other days.  Needless to says there were words flying when we heard what Adrian had done.  After much to do they were able to get most of the reservations back.  Now they need to make sure that Federal Express delivers the tickets to us on Saturday.  More last minute hair pulling - are they going to be right?   22 JUNE 2004  BULA !     ( It means "health" in Fijian.  But they use it as a hello.)  We left the USA last night at 11:30.  At least I think it was last night.  We left on the 20th and arrived on the 22.  It seems strange to have totally lost the summer solstice.  We went from having the longest day to having the longest night.  We told the kids that it's great because the days will just keep getting longer down here.  Even with the jet lag it feels wonderful to be back in the southern hemisphere.  It was still dark  after we cleared customs.  We landed on the Fiji island of Viti Levu, the largest of more than 300 "bits of land"  some of which come and go with the tide and storms.    We were waiting outside the airport and I automatically looked up for Orion. (I couldn't see him at all in Phoenix)  I need to buy a book or at least a star chart - I have no idea where the Southern Cross is.  We met a couple from England who are taking six weeks and traveling around the world with their 2 and 3 year olds.  He is between jobs and thought they would never have the time again.  They were perfect people to help calm our nerves - people who are taking chances and following their dreams, even if it isn't a convenient time.  The place we are staying is a typical Fijian hotel.  The kids love having breakfast pool side and retiring to the villa when they're had their fill of food and swimming.   We tried keeping them up to overcome the jet lag.  Unfortunately, they are doing great, it's Tom and myself that are having the trouble keeping awake.    We took them in a taxi to downtown Nadi.  The route took us past sugar cane fields and locals with their veggie stands.  We also saw the part of Fiji that isn't in the brochures.  While sitting in a restaurant the local village children, dressed in their school uniforms, would stare at us sitting there.  Occasionally, if we caught their eye the would wave a shy little wave while having a huge grin on their faces.  There was a fair amount of shopping for tourist, so I can't imagine that seeing a white person is a novelty.     24 June 2004  We took a very small plane (18 people including the pilots) to the island Vanua Levu and the town of Savusavu.  We learned that Sean ready does get motion sickness.  There was a great deal of turbulence with take off and landing.  Especially landing as a storm was moving in.  This appears to be a much smaller and poorer town.  The kids and I walked through town will Tom tried to print our visa information for Australia.  We came across school children we didn't have shoes.  Stopped by an open market where fresh pineapple, a large one even by american standards, was 1 dollar Fijian. (1$ Fijian = 55 cents US)  Many of the homes where worn.  The hotel wasn't that great, but I have also stayed in worst.  The poverty bothers Sean.  He has always been sensitive to the needs of others and wants to help them.  Tom read that 50% of the population under the age of 25 is unemployed.  That is huge to begin with but also since they have a very young population to begin with!  I don't want to be callous towards Sean and his feelings, but this is exactly why we wanted them to see the rest of the world.  That not everyone has gameboy, a pair of shoes for school or even enough to eat.    Speaking of enough to eat,  they are learning that they can't get the food they are used to.  There has been a night or two where they are going to bed hungry because they didn't like what was being served and no other food available.  I don't know if this is being too hard on them.  But I do want them to learn to eat what they choose.   The flowers are beautiful.  They said that this was a bad time to be here for the flowers, since it is winter,  But I thought they were gorgeous.  In Fiji if you are unmarried you put the flower over your left ear.  If you are married it's the right.  Although I have noticed some men put it behind both..............   25 June 2004  We arrived yesterday at the Cousteau Resort.  We are so not like this place.  They were waiting and singing for us when we had arrived.  As we climbed out of the car, glasses of juice were put in our hands, some one introduced herself as Mere and took the kids off on a tour of the place.  Tom and I did the usual sign in stuff that included "How would you like to spend your time here?  Snorkel, scuba dive, sea kayak, walks in the rain forest, sailing.  It is a bit overwhelming and I feel embarrassed to be here.  It was truly wonderful but I still wonder about the side that you don't see.  How do the natives feel about the people who come here.  28 JUNE	2004  OK, enough of paradise.  I think we are vacationed out and just want to be home at least be in Tasmania.  We fly out in two more days.
