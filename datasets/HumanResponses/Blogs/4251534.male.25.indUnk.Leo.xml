      Like I'v said befor "I work to much"  Location: Leo's Videos Date: Aug um...tuesday..um...17th 2004 Time: 9:45 pm  So. I'm just sitting here .doodeedoo we've had a good day which for us doesn't amount to much as of yet. The door opens and some f*cker wearing a took (wooly winter hat) and a big plastic pair of shades enters.  Gun in one hand and a plastic bag in the other. Now this sh*t of a f*ckhead proseads to rob me. I do have to say that it was nice of him not to point the gun at me and yell. fact is he kept the gun at his side and hardly said two words. I had no helpfull discription for the cops, But still spent over two houres with them and did not get to bed until 2:00 am and we got our first "are you o.k" call at 7:30 - the robbery was on the news at 7:00.  Then some recorded asshole advertiser (I think. I hung up) called.  F*CKERS. So we last a little over $100.00 to the robbery, but on the bright side we got on t.v. radio newspapre and local internet news thingy so, lots-o-good advertising. We will see if it helps any. Now it is raining and businesss is good. Ya. leo

      Today is monday.. SSSSLLLLOOOWWW SLOW monday. Work. I work to much.  the story. New van Starting date: july 24 2004 Setting: parking lot of coopers food, Kelowna B.c With: girlfreind (Emily the beautiful) and family Things always go wrong on birthdays yet they are always so much fun. Over the past few days our car has been causing us some trouble. 5:00 pm saturday she dies out side of the grocery store (starter shot) Car value $3.78 The death of cassidy (our car) has been antisapated ever since we got her 2 years ago, but why on my birthday and why when we are broke? This past week a co-worker of emily's tells her she will sell us her mini van (1988 light blue dodge caravan) for $500.00. Thursday. I go to meet emilys co-worker and we drive to her house 20-25 minutes away, but a nice drive. At this point I have removed the expired plates from cassidy. We get to the van and I put the expired plates from cassidy on it, and drive back to our home. so far so good. Friday 13th. 9:12am. making an omlette, I go and look out the window. (I had to park the uninsured van with expired plates belonging to cassidy on the street overnight due to cassidy being in our parking spot.) so I'm at the window and guess what I see (it's..a bird? hmmm.. no maybe its a plane...nno.) It's a COP and a TOWTRUCK fuck I go running out the door and down the stairs. wearing only jeans -I shoulda bin on kops- So the cop is realy nice and explains that he could give me one ticket for having an un-licensed vehicle on the road ($100.00) as well as at ticket for missuse of plates (190.00) and he could take my plates (30.00) for new ones. He did none of these horrible things to me as I rapidly explained how we had just spent our last $500.00 on the van blaa blaa bla. But as polite as the towtruck driver was..... he still took our van ALL THE FREAKIN WAY ACROSS TOWN... so as the day goes by I come to the realisation that the papers I need to insure the van are...um..IN THE VAN... so at 4:00 whem emily gets of work and comes to the store (we own a video store) I have to BIKE thats right BIKE my lazy ass in the scorching semi desert heat of kelowna on a sunny day all the way over to the place were our van was being kept (were I am informed that it will cost $84.73 to get our van back) so I politly explain to the mean looking tatto cover bald muscle head behind the plexie glass, that driver dude had said it would cost $30.00-40 to get it back and that they would be nice to me..Whimmper Whimmper. This of course does me no good. I get my papers from the van, bike all the way back to the -pant pant weez pant- insurence place. were i still don't have all of the stuff I need. Emily faxes over the remaining documents...oh. oh wait they DO have every thing we need (jerks). So then I haul my skinny little ass back onto the bike (by the way I had rollerbladed to work so I had no shoes so I'm wearing emilys girl sandles and her girly back pack) and ride back to the van. I ask the guy if they take debit "yep" so I "only have $60.00 cash the rest will have to go on the card" he nicley say's $60.00 will do.. I drive away hot tired pissed off but happy to have a new van... THE END p.s every body at the beach got to see my willy because I went swimming in my white boxers...
