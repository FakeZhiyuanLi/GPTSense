       Hello guys! This blog was created so that we could keep in touch until the day of The Reunion. Also, mucho thanks to Mr Lee's suggestion to place the count-down-meter online! There's a count-down script, photo gallery and a tag-board at the right hand side of the page. (More to come) Til' then, take care and all the best for your prelims.  " Dream the dreams that have never been dreamt. " -- David Bower     The Six Mistakes of Man  1. The delusion that personal gain is made by crushing others. 2. The tendency to worry about things that cannot be changed or corrected. 3. Insisting that a thing is impossible because we cannot accomplish it. 4. Refusal to set aside trivial preferences. 5. Neglecting development and refinement of the mind, and not acquiring the habit of reading or studying. 6. Attempting to compel others to believe and live as we do.

      First days are so  exhausting  i tell ya.. fortunately  mr lee  was absent today and we had 2 periods of free time. the other 2 math periods were spent on congruency by 2 relief teachers  mr wong  (i think) and  miss ng . mr wong resembles  clay aiken  so yeah, that was actually pretty cool. the guys and  jiax  actually thought i had a crush on him. * tsssk ..which is so not true haha. anyways, ms ng came in 1 period later.. and  nic  and her had a loong chat. she was from rgs! cool. she went around then came to MY desk. played with mah  mr bean  teddy keychain and childishly said to herself  "ayee so cute!!"  then she suddenly turned to me and asked curiously,  "are you a eurasian?"  then i gave her this  -.-"""  look.  Hmmm.. i hate to be rude but i honestly don't quite like her.. =\  i dislike people who purchase tinted contacts. she has grey ones. yuk.    Mr hang  came and spoke to us today as well. although he didn't quite emphasize on what he actually wanted to as he kept cutting in with all kinds of diff experience.. the msg he actually wanted to bring across to us is to not look down on ourselves..must be confident..etc =) yeah. to find out more, read  nic 's (amelia) blog. he's a gd principal i know.  After assembly, we had a spot check. hahaaa we pretty much humiliated myself in front of my classmates and teachers.  mrs abdul  wanted our blouses tucked into our skirts/pants all the way. aah. like  lin yi qin . *tsk tsk. damn funny though. lols. we looked so much like geeks! i had a tummyache after laughing too much.  Anyways,  nic  eats too much whip potatoes..  =\ nic, cut down on that will ya? you don't wanna turn into a potato do ya? hahaaa =P

       Valerene  and i have decided not to go for our kayaking course today. instead, we would be attending the 2 day course on the 6th and 13th of July.  Hopefully  nothing crops up at the very last moment. just 2 days back, we were informed that the  Police knowledge  course would last for 3 days, instead of 2. the test was held at  Training command  (Tracom in short, also known as the Police academy) today.  Everything went smoothly.. in the beginning, we had to march a longass distance to the lecture theatre. then we were brought to air-conditioned classrooms =) we combined classes with  queenstown sec  for the test.. they were pretty.. crazy like us. our PCIs were  really  nice. he allowed us to cheer and stuff while the other classes had to shut their mouths up for the entire 3 hours +..  =P After the test we wenta' change into our quarter Us and this group of annoying fucktards (PCIs) totally abused their authority!  i hate them . i know i once said,  it takes a lot of energy to hate someone . however in this case, they are SO worth to be despised and blacklisted. i hope one of them accidentally comes across my site and reads this. yay. i hate you.   Lunch was  okkaaay . i had carrot cake with  ma'am  jess ,  fungi kor , val,  jeff  and the other CIs. then got home while the rest wenta' catch  charlies angels  full throtle. aaah. tired.. ahaa. anyways!  today  is a special day. so i shall take some time to think about things. take care lovers =D *teehee.

The  tres B uno  BBQ finally! while we were on our way to west coast park, it started pouring. so we walked under the rain slowly and drenched ourselves totally. took my towel out to shelter  amily ,  kalyn  and myself then we hid under a tree. haha. so weird. then  jason (weihoong) had a  brilliant  idea to go to the beach cos' it was windy. we stayed there and wet ourselves further while  jess ,  ruth  and  siti  wenta' ginza plaza to get some stuff from shop and save.  georgia  and  hafiz  came a coupla' minutes after.. under the rain as well. haha. this family left the lil' hut/shelter so we took the entire thing to ourselves. like  yay  finally someplace dry. =)  while it was still raining cats and dogs.. the hut started to flood! teehee. we lay garbage bags (clean ones) on the ground and all sat around and played  DARE . before you do the dare.. each of us would hafta' eat a nut with  wasabi !  yukk!  mine turn came then it was quite gross lar.. and my dare was by stoopid  jason  haha. i hadta' sit on  jeremy's  lap and do some hug hug thing while they took a picture. some other really fun 'dares' was siti's when she had to unzip  lucas's  shirt and hugged him from behind?? and ruth's boogie dance! later we had lunch at KFC... then flew kite.. climbed pyramid.. took pics ;) teehee.. walk a lot too..  jeremy , amily,  simon  and i wenta' pick  miss koh  up from the bus stop. wooh. couldn't recognise her from far. then jeremy walked  barefooted  from the park to the bus stop cos his socks were soaked. lols. stinky feet! =P when we got back the guys were already producing some work! very impressed. you should've seen jason fanning the fire and all that. haha. so zai!  kenneth  and the other dudes also helped.. then the girls (ruth, amily, karen, geraldine, eileen, jess, siti, myself, kalyn) all helped out to prepare the food :) most of us were helping to thaw the 1/4 frozen chicken with our hands (wore plastic gloves) teehee then ruth the no.1 chicken poker taught all of us how to use the " zhu zhen " (according the gerald! it's the long satay stick) to pierce the chicken really nicely. it was something like the  fang tai  cooking show ahha. all the house wives learning how to cook! lols.. then we started speaking in mandarin cos' we wanted to help gerald, eileen and ruth to revise for their chinese orals.. lols!  karen  made me laugh so much =P after dinner with the teachers ( ms halizah  came later too), games.. i wenta' play soccer with the guys!! ;) was hilarious.. cos'  zuhayr  let me kick in 2 goals teehee =P  siti  told us ghost stories and freaked miss koh out.. then we wenta' the mush track thingy? i duno what is it called.. each had to find a partner and walk in the dark.. pretty scary.. then we all started screaming and freaking each other out!! did lotsa' stuff then cleaned up the place.. by then it was already 9pm++.. took a pic altogether then left.. really sleepy and happy =)     Today  ..  had  police knowledge  course at school. since we were the host, there were a lot of things to be done by us.. it was pretty tiring but it got better later. we got to serve them food in a buffet style. =) anyways the course was from 8am-5pm and i'm really beat now.. still gotta polish boots for tmrw.  I was really upset when i found out that there was a 3rd day for the course.  the test . honestly, i would rather go to the kayaking course. * tsssssk . really extremely confused cos i don't know what to do.. until  fungi kor  suggested something.. felt relieved afterwhich.  however ,  mr lau  later sms-ed and said that the test would end at 10am, when my kayaking course starts at 10am too. and it takes like 1 hour to get there by taxi i think. * sighs . geeeshhh okay wanna go polish my boots oredi. ciao friends! =) *huggles*  And  welcome back joanne!  haha. =)

       Puppies for sale    A farmer had some puppies he needed to sell. He painted a sign advertising the pups and set about nailing it to a post on the edge of his yard. As he was driving the last nail into the post, he felt a tug on his overalls. He looked down into the eyes of a little boy.   Mister," he said, "I want to buy one of your puppies."   "Well," said the farmer, as he rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck, "these puppies come from fine parents and cost a good deal of money."   The boy dropped his head for a moment. Then reaching deep into his pocket, he pulled out a handful of change and held it up to the farmer. "I've got thirty-nine cents. Is that enough to take a look?"  "Sure," said the farmer.   And with that he let out a whistle,"Here, Dolly!" he called.  Out from the doghouse and down the ramp ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.   As the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else stirring inside the doghouse. Slowly another little ball appeared; this One noticeably smaller. Down the ramp it slid. Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling toward the others, doing its best to catch up....  "I want that one," the little boy said, pointing to the runt.   The farmer knelt down at the boy's side and said, "Son, you don't want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs would."  With that the little boy stepped back from the fence, reached down, and began rolling up one leg of his trousers. In doing so he revealed a steel brace running down both sides of his leg attaching itself to a specially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, "You see sir, I don't run too well myself, and he will need someone who understands."

      The Japanese buffet dinner was wonderful. i'm bloated. i  looove  tempuras. it has been quite some time since i've consumed really really  really  fresh prawns. the chefs prolly deep fried them while those pathetic creatures were still struggling for help =\ haha. i really don't know. i had quite a lot of fun with my god-mother, lil cousin and my grandma. it wasn't that bad afterall. i actually felt quite comfortable around them. i would appreciate it though, if they'd speak up more often and crack some corny jokes! because that is what  my  family usually does. i adore fun people. =D  Anyways, i had  better  wake up by 9.30am tomorrow.  Yongjie  and i might be workin on our homework together. hopefully he is able to make it. besides, i need to write a compo of characterisation all about him! so i should really get to know him better. i would then be killing two birds with one stone.   Yongjie unable to make it = no motivation = zilch productivity!!   * Tsk!!  at least if someone goes, i'll be able to force mahself to do something.

      Each morning i awake to the euphonious guitar chords played by my lil' sissa  Serene , which is supposed to be a mimic of an alarm as i do not have a sound proof bedroom door. however, it seems more like a lullaby than an alarm as i am simply reluctant to get out of bed. i have absolutely no life at all. the following is my daily dosage:  - brunch, alone in front of the telly - bath time babeh - computer!  yeehaw!  (im a net geek) - telly time - dinner -  more  telly  - slack and unwind - read (magazines  only !) - nitey mates   Yesterday was mucho productive though. i went ta daddy's club for a swim. not forgetting, i caught  the hulk  with a coupla' seniors. it was an average movie.  I seriously gotta do something about this. sucks big time yo. this will prolly be my last entry ever cos' i will no longer be alive after this night. my parents are going to chop off my head and eat it for supper because i have yet to complete my holiday assignments and i am addicted to the frickin web design programme on my puter.  fuckkkkkkkk . Oh well life wasnt that fun anyways.. everyone who reads this is invited to my funeral. i hope you miss me. TOODLES!!

      Ever miss getting some old fashioned love letters? you know on paper and with ink.. with postage stamps. considering the rampant spread of e-mail, the chances of actually receiving a real flesh and blood letter are so slim as to be laughable.. but never fear, the internet solves all problems. Since the next best thing to a real love letter is a scanned one,  urlLink here is a site  that has exactly that: scanned love letters. 300 of them!

       Zuhayr  wants me to teach him how to play the guitar once i have  mastered  it.   Buttttt... since i'm learning it  on my own  (yes without anyone's help! tssk), it'll prolly take me a coupla years -.-" Who knows, i might even give up in just a coupla' days. HA!  It's kinda fun though.. as i was chatting with zuhayr and  jeremy  online last night, i printed out the guitar chords and strummed 2 songs by  avril lavigne , i felt so satisfied. ;) it's very very difficult hey.. fingers pain le. I think i should get some tips from  bingrui  and  huizhen (whitney) then go to  phoebe's  place to do some major jammin with her drumset. that would be cool.

      Remember, don't waste time comparing your life to others who seem more fortunate. being fortunate is based on how much peace you have, not how many luxuries or conveniences you have. practice from the heart to make peace with what is, then life gives you more help to change things for the better.  -  Doc Childre

        YAY  orz! I'm back from a 3 day 2 night Adventure Training Camp (NPCC) at Pulau Ubin. it was so incredibly enthralling and memorable.  natalie ,  valerene ,  hafiz ,  jeff ,  chihwei  and I were selected among our other squadmates to assist the sirs and ma'ams at the camp. we were considered as NCOs there. =D those secondary 2 kids were so adorable. they could not quit addressing me as "ma'am". same goes for nat and all. that was the very first time i felt.. "BIG".      Day 1   Left school for the jetty at Changi then took a ferry to PU. hiked a long ass distance to the campsite with all the heavy 'barang barang'. the 6 of us were the first to arrive with a coupla' sirs cos we had to unpack all the food rations, tent-pitching equipment and stuff. we had to do most of the 'dirty work'.  The secondary 2 cadets took quite awhile to settle down. they took almost up to 2 hours to pitch their tents (4 to each) when a team of 8 can actually do it in 15 minutes. afterwhich, own activities.. while the NCOs had to take care of a lot of other stuff. so tiring k. dinner was quite fun.. outdoor cooking. had instant noodles and some can food. i looove pineapples! the weird thing is that, everyone at the camp seems to have a fetish for pineapples.  Activities til' damn late. mock campfire was hilarious. the NCOs helped out a lil' in the cheering part then  sir yongfa  did some silly dances.. =D got to know some cute ACS(I) guys cos' i sat beside them during the mock campfire. haha. NCOs took our bath at 11 plus. i slept at.. hmm.. 1am ++? cos this annoying freak sir SO had to wake val, nat and i up in the girls dorm to switch dorms.. *tsk tsk.   But before that.. we were enjoyin ourselves bathing.. while the sec 2s all had to knock it down duno how many? stay in pumpin position.. under sir kiwi.. so don't expect him to be merciful.. cos truthfully, a bunch of em' were blatently rude and rowdy.  very  disappointing.      Day 2   Woke up to the bellowing of  sir benghui  and that  dragonball dude  at 6am ++ during the sec 2's physical training. so many casualties! heard they kana pumping lotsa times. Jeff cooked noodles for nat and i then we became nurses of the day. heh. gotta take care of those poor lil' souls. some were faking. their acting skills seriously suck big time. *sigh*  All left for  the amazing race  around pulau ubin from 9am-4pm.  sir kiwi  made the NCOs in charge of the casualties and we had to stay indoors. they had to do area cleaning! at first i thought sir kiwi was being really mean to get the sick ppl to wash the toilets and stuff. however, sir kiwi has done all those first aid crapola shitznitzz before and he could tell who were really sick and who weren't. power rite. the cadets i was in charge of were really obedient. on the other hand, val's group of boys were a disaster. they tried to lock her in the campers toilet.. sprayed water at her..point middle finger.. blah blah. val complained to  sir alan . all knock it down. sir alan so zai!!!  This new town boy kept asking nat what my name was  then when i walked down the slope to check on them scrubbin the messtins at the campers toilet, he began following me everywhere i went and wanted me to tell him my telephone number, address and 'if i gotta boyfriend or not?' or else he would not stop followin.. he's quite funny larh.. but must maintain NCO standard sia.. haha.. so me just smile at him talk abit and made sure that he wasn't 'eating snake'. then.. hmm.. cleaned somemore.. slacked big time.. let them rest.. very soon it was 4pm plus and the teams from the amazing race returned all bushed. sec 2s kana pumping  again ... this buncha' campers are so nonchalent. Dinner was provided by Mr Lau. (yay!) he treated the NCOs to friedrice. glad he knew we were sick of the instant noodles. campfire til' 10 plus.. er it was quite alright lar. kinda' boring but erm quite funny? once again, they kana pump. *sigh* NCOs took our baths at 11 plus then nat, val and i decided to sleep in the canteen with some of the sirs and ma'ams. sir kiwi spoke to us.. wow.. raised mah confidence level and i really appreciated what he had told us. me was so effin' cold.. practically freezing! could not sleep cos the benches were er, hard? -.-"     Day 3   Woke up early. had lotsa' things to settle cos it's the final day. PT as usual. shared noodles with jeff then packed our bags.. packed rations into boxes.. we were treated like servants and dogs.. did dirty work told by sirs. those mean mean ones from new town especially. i don't quite like em. even had to take out all the 34 sets of bed sheets and pillow covers all those crapola shitznitzz then fold them and all tt... val say next time no job we shld work at ritz carlton hotel clean hotel rooms. -.-" later.. packed those tent equipment.. etc etc from 7am plus to 10 plus just kept being told to do all the work loh. today  sir OJ  allowed us to PUMP THE CADETS! wow. but none of us did.. took group pix then left the campsite.. hiked back to jetty then back to where i belong hehe.   OKie gonna sleep now... toodles.

      Morning good people. the weather right now is suprisingly cool. an estimation of 28 degree celsius. bloody awesome hey! I wish some things would stay the way it is. unfortunately,  nic  is right. things do change, people do change. but we can't just put the blame on people/objects. that isn't what life is all about. we have to accommodate ourselves to the new requirements from time to time, which I admit, can suck at times. life is all about challenging ourselves. without obstacles, life would be effin' uninteresting wouldn't it?  That is why I believe everything that we are put to go through in life happens for a cause. we just have to sit back, and think calmly of what we ought to learn from it.

Good luck to  Sir Faizal  for his posting tomorrow! oh yes, i have decided to go to the guide's campfire. initially i didn't feel like attending cos' i would be the only girl. however, i managed to get  nana ,  jo ,  ros  and  kasinah  to come along. now i wouldn't feel alone! =D  yipee!  and about tmrw's shooting competition, i'm feeling really psyched. i can't wait.

       The positive side of life   Living on Earth is expensive, but it does include a free trip around the sun every year.      How long a minute is depends on what side of the bathroom door you're on.   Birthdays are good for you; the more you have, the longer you live.   Happiness comes through doors you didn't even know you left open.   Ever notice that the people who are late are often much jollier than the people who have to wait for them?   You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person.   Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.   Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened.   A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour.   Have an awesome day, and know that someone who thinks you're great has thought about you today!..   "And that person was me."..... Please don't keep this message to yourself.....send it to those who mean so much to you.... "NOW"....    urlLink Sticker   urlLink print .

      In 1883, a creative engineer named John Roebling was inspired by an idea to build a spectacular bridge connecting New York with the Long Island. However bridge building experts throughout the world thought that this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea. It just could not be done. It was not practical. It had never been done before.   Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. He thought about it all the time and he knew deep in his heart that it could be done. He just had to share the dream with someone else. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built.   Working together for the first time, the father and son developed concepts of how it could be accomplished and how the obstacles could be overcome. With great excitement and inspiration, and the headiness of a wild challenge before them, they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge.  The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move.    "We told them so." "Crazy men and their crazy dreams." "It`s foolish to chase wild visions."  Everyone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge could be built. In spite of his handicap Washington was never discouraged and still had a burning desire to complete the bridge and his mind was still as sharp as ever.   He tried to inspire and pass on his enthusiasm to some of his friends, but they were too daunted by the task. As he lay on his bed in his hospital room, with the sunlight streaming through the windows, a gentle breeze blew the flimsy white curtains apart and he was able to see the sky and the tops of the trees outside for just a moment.   It seemed that there was a message for him not to give up. Suddenly an idea hit him. All he could do was move one finger and he decided to make the best use of it. By moving this, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife.   He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish but the project was under way again.  For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm, until the bridge was finally completed. Today the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its glory as a tribute to the triumph of one man's indomitable spirit and his determination not to be defeated by circumstances. It is also a tribute to the engineers and their team work, and to their faith in a man who was considered mad by half the world. It stands too as a tangible monument to the love and devotion of his wife who for 13 long years patiently decoded the messages of her husband and told the engineers what to do.  Perhaps this is one of the best examples of a never-say-die attitude that overcomes a terrible physical handicap and achieves an impossible goal.    + + +  Often when we face obstacles in our day-to-day life, our hurdles seem very small in comparison to what many others have to face... however, The Brooklyn Bridge shows us that dreams that seem impossible can be realised with determination and persistence, no matter what the odds are.  Even the most distant dream, can be realized with determination and persistence.

      Ello ello people! =) how's everyone? thanks for all the geustbook entries btw. i read through every single one and i felt so motivated. especially * clears throat * his. i seem so affected by everyone's moods. when i'm with different people, my mood differs. take for example today.  nic  has been feeling really down due to certain problems. when i was with her i felt depressed too. i was worried. and i scolded her for doing something really foolish. as her friend, i guess all i can do is to advice that poor lil' soul and state my opinions. whether she wants to follow her heart, or take my advice, it's totally up to her. she has the right to decide anyways. then there's  jason ,  jeremy  and  eileen . when i'm with them, i feel as though i am on cloud nine. when eileen and i look at each other. the first thing we do is to laugh out loud. when jeremy and i meet, we sing our favourite songs, he whines, and i talk. when  jason  and i sit beside one another, everything seems to be flowing so naturally. we can simply talk about any thing. his  incredibly  corny jokes make me laugh my ass off.  amily ,  ruth ,  nana  and  jessica  are such cheerful sweethearts, to just look at them in the eye would make my day.  jiax ,  martin  and  fengrui  are the 3  crazy  peeps who are basically the funniest people.. but they can be very very corny too. fengrui likes to challenge me by   suaning   me. so i guess being around him would perfect my suaning skills too. i can remember extremely clearly when i was in secondary 1. haha. it was horrifying. when people  suan-ed  me, i would just smile or giggle. i mean, it wasn't fun at all! i truthfully haven't encountered anything like that when i was in pri skl. because such things don't happen often in an all girls skl. no wonder i didn't have any guy friends besides those 2 sissified guys when i was in sec 1. i've learnt so much during my 2 and a half years here in CTSS. can you imagine how much more we would have to learn in the near future? like SO SO SO SO SO ever SO mucho. and if i do show interest in those stuff, i can gurantee myself that i would be quite a smartie hey? haha. okay.. enough already. but honestly speaking hey, even  samuel  was surprised when he experienced me suaning him back... *teehee.  I am feeling much better so ignore the previous post. i was basically typing out how i felt at that moment. i didn't mean it. on a brighter note, my lil' sister and i have reconciled. haha okok it wasn't that serious but we ignored each other for a night. she designed a postcard and apologised to me. that was before i went for my  kayaking 1 star course  on sunday. *sigh. like, she stayed up til' mid night to do that for me... i said sorry to her too.. because i also made her cry and i wouldn't say i wasn't in the wrong because  i was . as an older sister, i really should've handled the situation by giving in to her. my dad reprimanded me for that. anyway!! now that we've made up, i would so love to squeeze her cheeks =D i want to be a better older sister. i wonder if i am a good one.. people say i am like a mother to them. but at home, it's tough for my lil' sister to respect me and treat me as a role model as much as i wish her to, because i  do not  set a good example! remember i have a list of accomplishments which i want to achieve? i have added that in.. in fact, i have longed to be a good older sister since i was younger.   After assembly today, i went for a lil' shopping spree and spent quite a bit. i felt good letting go some money. anyways, i am off to fill my stomach. so take care ya'll =) lotsa' love and friedrice

      "Why is everything so confusing?? maybe i'm just out of my mind."  Why i am crying over stupid things and wasting time on stupid things. because im a stupid fool. people take me for granted. people don't care about how i feel. people say this, people say that. since nobody likes the current pearlyn then let's see how it would be like if i were to be stricter, firmer, much much more hard-hearted, bitchier, more selfish, insensitive, inconsiderate and loud.   I currently really hate my life. things are messy. and i just quarelled with my little sister and  i am crying . this is what i get after a tirin day at school. i am already  so drained  from every fucking thing. school. tests. [him]. npcc. homework. friends. annoying sisters. kayaking tests. tuitions. myself. like wow i'm already almost 15 and i am  actually  crying because i think my life sucks. i was SO born a loser hey.  God must hate me, cursed me for eternity.

I didn't update on what has been happening at school yesterday. it was helluva' amusing because my  spare tyre ,   jason   (weihoong) is right beside mah.  ms halizah  probably decided to put him and i together because she thinks that i am the only person who can tolerate his wackiness! i love sitting with  karen ,  jeremy ,  jason  and  eileen ! our mouths never get to rest. dang, i love to talk! don't you??! hmm. no wonder  amily  and i got reprimanded by potato head  mrs chen  after bio lessons. * tssk.  anyways, we deserved it, we weren't even cooperating with that poor lil' soul when she was trying to make us focus and understand the chapter. anyhow, we apologised. that made me feel  really guilty . on a brighter note..  (:   HAPPY BIRTHDAY EILEEN!!!   :)   P.S:  he called!! haha. like  OMIGAWSH!!  * faints * lmao..  P.P.S:  i can't wait fer' tmrw! yeehaw!

         The blow was almost too painful to bear. this was because hopes that conjoined  Iranian twins  Laden and Laleh Bijani would pull through the risky surgery to separate them had soared SO high. even at 1.30pm yesterday after they had been separated, optimism remained high.  Suddenly, within hours, they were both  DEAD .  The team of 6 surgeons and their 100 supporting staff had tried to stem the profuse bleeding. they failed. but we should not allow this tragic setback to douse the fire of our passion to push the frontiers of medical science or have our nerves frayed in the facing similar challenges in future. they are bound to come our way again.  What led to the deaths will be examined and analysed in weeks ahead and something positive would have been learnt, to be shared with the international medical community. the surgeons involved in this operation should be proud that they had the courage to take this calculated risk in trying to help Laden and Laleh when no others in the world wanted to. even the Germans declined to help when they were approached by the sisters in 1996.  the surgeons here knew the outcome could go either way. but more importantly,  the twins knew, too.   the worst has come to pass and this was something the Raffles Hospital team was aware it had to face.  When they were as young as eight, a family friend remembers seeing the pair trying to walk in opposite directions to break free from each other. public hopes that they would survive the surgery, which began on sunday, had taken to the sky partly because of Dr Gog and his team team's success with the Nepalese twins.   Laden and Laleh knew that the operation was highly risky, yet they wanted to go through with it in order to fulfil their hope of being separated.  they faced the challenge with  remarkable  fortitude, optimism and cheerfulness.    -  Extracted from Streats and The Straits Times  -   I was deeply saddened by the news when i was told by my mom yesterday. Laden and Laleh were such adorable common laymen.. they absolutely did not deserve this. what wrong have they done? to choose to lead separate lives? on the other hand, i hope all of us have learnt something from this. we should all appreciate and cherish the people around us. the lives we lead. the things we own. and who we are.  we are undeniably, very lucky . i would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Iranian people and the family of Laden and Laleh.   To everyone who reads this, do take care.   "Ladan and Laleh, like two butterflies have burnt in the candle of destiny, but it is the light of this candle which gives us the hope to continue the endeavour for the betterment of human life."

This name makes you think of   RYAN:   JOCK boy. the jerk type who makes out with random cheerleaders by his locker EVERYDAY and occasionally with the not-so-gorgeous nerds, just to torment them. he gets away with EVERYTHING though, just because he looks like OHMYGOSH!! HAYDEN CHRISTIANSEN.   ALEX:  sporty guy with a goofy grin. he is tall and lanky and most definitely a redhead. his skin is permanently pink. he's really good at running, although he flaps his arms too much and looks like a chicken when he does.   TIFFANY:   exotic girl with her hair in cornrows. she's the funky hiphop type, she's into breakdancing, dj-ing and grafitti art and she beats the boys at it all. she LOVES bar top dances.   PAUL:   the boy in the corner, gazing out of the window during class, he stands up occasionally to make inspirational speeches which are mostly irrelevant to anything that is being discussed, but he gets away with it.    ABBY:  goth-ish grunge girl, dressed in vintage black. she loves drama with a passion. she is often seen with a camera and she goes around filming people in the hallways. she tints all her short-films purple though, because it's prettier that way.    PHIL:  guy in a tight t-shirt and feminine cut jeans, and that versace bag. he is not gay, he just has a horrible sense of fashion and tries to be everything, punk rock, emo, vintage all at once. he waves his hands about too much and oh yeah, and he just LOVES giving girls fashion tips.    SALLY:  surfer chick! long, straight, silky dark brown hair accompanied by streaks of light brown. she does 100 sit-ups a day and has very nice, firm abs.   DERRICK:   boy in too-big-pants and a backward baseball cap who watches MTV too much for his own good ("i'm just chilling, man!"). he never hears what you say because he's always plugged into his CD player, grooving to ludacris or missy elliot. he starts every single sentence with "y'all" and ends it with "dude" or "man".   ALLEN:  androgynous pretty boy. he looks like a fairy, and has dark haunted smoky eyes and full girly lips. the girls adore him, and he could pass off as a model. but he never really belongs anywhere.   JODIE:  5 foot 11. gorgeous. black hair and green eyes. model type. totally.   SAM:  loud nihilistic girl who is pro-anarchy. she's a rebel and a non-conformist, and sometimes tries to hard in the process.    MICHELLE:  preppy, AVRIL LAVIGNE worshipper.   JESSICA:   blonde cheerleader captain with that jock boyfriend and that huge clique of admiring girl pals. she ALWAYS needs a manicure, or a pedicure (they are like therapeutic!). she is the miss popular type, everyone can't help but loveeee. her  dream is to be on the cover of Seventeen and get voted prom queen.    LEAH:  child-like girl with her blonde hair tied in plaits. you can almost see her mind wandering off to make believe land.    ERIK:  hippie boy. he wears tie dye (homemade) and has long straggly hair, pulled back from his face by a sweaty headband. he kisses trees and holds candlelight vigils in times square. the boy believes in peace, love, hope, joy.   BILLY:  the type of guy who is ALWAYS sweating from his armpits. he's a little momma's boy and dresses in white collared shirts and Sesame Street ties. his socks are nearly knee high, his shirt is tucked all the way in, and his pant's are pulled up to his bellybutton by suspenders. he's not very bright either, and doesn't get any of the jokes people say. he's quite a sad little thing. his parents own a farm.   JOSHUA:  typical slacker boy (i would have said JOCK. if his name was josh. but well joshua is a different thing all together). he doesn't care what people think of him REALLY. he just hangs in the garage and plays the electric guitar. he wears whatever comes out of the laundry (if he bothers to even change) usually its the same nirvana shirt, torn up jeans, grunge sneakers assemble. even his hair is naturally messed up. of course, he begins every sentence with "like", and EVERYTHING he says even the most direct statements , sounds like a question. ("like, he was here today? and like, i saw him?")   BRITNEY:   annoying little sister of a head cheerleader (see JESSICA). probably a ten year old, who is as blonde as her sister. she wears her hair in pigtails and lovessss picking up the extension to whine while big sis jess is on the phone mushytalking with her boyfriend. an aspiring teenybopper star, who just adoresadoresADORES dreamstreet.   CHRIS:  spiky hair and sunglasses, he has barbie doll eyes and plucked eyebrows. he lounges about in his convertible in too-tight sleeveless tops and leopard print leather pants. he's perfectly straight though, in fact he's a playboy and he changes girls like he switches rhinestone earings.   MARIO:  three words: Gay Italian Fashionista   BRANDON:   a poet, a writer, an artist, a singer...and very pretty on top of that.   Hahaha i guess i got REALLY carried away describing people. but its fun! and it boosts your creativity :D * beams *

      Today was incredibly terrible and stinkin.  i was suicidal this morning.  i felt so depressed and low-spirited. i felt like crying the whole day.. i guess most of my close friends know why :(  Things changed for the better during the last period though.  ms halizah  switched places for a coupla' us during the last period. now i am sitting with  jason (weihoong). * beams *  jeremy  sits in front of me and  karen  sits behind me.   However, the day became really depressing again after i got home. man, my mood sure does fluctuate hey. i received news from  mummy  that the  Iranian twins  have passed away. i turned on the telly to channel news asia and read, " Latest news: Second Iranian twin dies  at the bottom of the screen. * sobs * i feel for them. i sms-ed  amily ,  jess  and  kalyn (dingling) about it..   Anyways, i hope tomorrow would be a better day.

      Yesterday was really fun :) i woke up at 5.30am and got ready to leave the house at 7am. do you think taking 1 and a half hours to get ready is too effin' long? haha. some people think so.. oh well. anyways, i reached clementi MRT at about 7.30am so i was the earliest! and saw  kenneth  and his friends who were on their way to kallang for the NDP full dress rehearsal.  valerene  came a lil' later and  jess  (ma'am yeewen) arrived late. we took the train to  tampines  and met up with  bernard ,  fungi kor ,  edywn  and  weix kor . afterwhich, we hopped onto bus  19  and it brought us to  CSSC ! (changi sea sports club)  I guess you already have an idea of what i did yesterday hey? haha. yup, you're right. i went  kayaking ! val and i signed up for the  1 star course  which consists of two lessons, both from 10am-5pm.  Our instructors were  serene  and  charles . serene is a NPCC ma'am and i think she's in her twenties. she's very good looking. charles was from NCC and he's quite corny. we changed into our wet attire and intro-ed ourselves to our group memebers! there were 10 of us altogether. val and i were the youngest. most of them were in their twenties.. from poly.. uni..  :) we had a lesson and introduction on the parts of a kayak. then tried to paddle. all the different strokes. we learnt lotsa' stuff yesterday. mainly:  - embarking - disembarking - forward stroke - backward stroke - sweep stroke (360 degrees) - J-draw - capsizing - T/X rescue  I don't have any problems with all the strokes. capsizing is scary but the more i try it, the more exciting it becomes. however, you wouldn't like it when all the salt water gets into your nose. very annoying =\ i personally find T/X rescue the most difficult =( it has to be done in pairs. one person has to rescue, while the other has to capsize on purpose. then the rescuer has to paddle to the capsized kayak, somehow lift the damn heavy thing up onto his/her own kayak with the haul facing upwards to allow all the water to flow out. then your partner (the person who capsized with the kayak) has to hook both legs and arms on one side of the kayak so it appears to be a  see-saw . (both kayaks are in a  t  shape) then you hold on to the deck line and swim to the other side and do the koala-bear hug again. it the kayak tilts and all the water flows out again. later, flip the kayak back with the haul under water then you gotta climb up the kayak with the help of the rescuer, which is damn tough for me.. * sigh * especially when we did it in the deep sea because the waves were so huge =X plus, i'm so heavy! so i need lotsa' arm muscles. haha. i should train up. one time, i kept trying to jump outta the water and flip my body onto the kayak until i had a cramp on my calf. so pain sia! * tsk * i had to do it 3 times altogether yesterday, 2 times compulsory while the other was volunteerily. and all 3 times i got up with the help of my friend. * phew * :)  At about 5pm.. we ended and had to wash our kayaks and trolleys. it was quite fun, i love to play with water hoses. haha. i also spoke to one of my group member...er.. i forgot her name.. i asked if she was a  butch  =\ do you think i was being rude? i hope not.. cos she said she wasn't offended :) she also said that she wouldn't classify herself as a butch. so i just smiled at her and asked if she was ready to carry the kayak over to the shelf. teehee. she's soooo very nice.. she helped out in our rescue by anchoring our kayaks when we were nearer the shore. and she has such huge arm muscles! i learnt that she was a dragon-boater from her partner :) val,  charlene ,  joyce  and i washed our hair in public at the showers and pipes where everyone goes to to wash their kayaks, cos' the shower room was bombarded with peeps. then dried our bodies and got changed. debrief after everything.. and left for dinner with my seniors at changi village :)    WOW , what a day! and i got sun burnt too. but last night i put like duno how many donkey layers of mosturizer cos i don't want my skin to peel. it looks okay now.. gonna return to the usual colour soon. hopefully by tomorrow :)

       Boney M  *  Rasputin       Ra, ra,  Rasputin , Russia's greatest love machine!  my personal pick of the week, this mp3 is not only a historical song (although not exactly accurate) which we (3B1) have learnt just last week (the Russian revolution), but also comic relief. we love Russia, yes we do. listen to it or else your fate will be similar to Rasputin's.      ((LYRICS))  There lived a certain man in Russia long ago He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow Most people looked at him with terror and with fear But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear He could preach the bible like a preacher Full of ecstacy and fire But he also was the kind of teacher Women would desire  RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen There was a cat that really was gone RA RA RASPUTIN Russia's greatest love machine It was a shame how he carried on  He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar In all affairs of state he was the man to please But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze For the queen he was no wheeler dealer Though she'd heard the things he'd done She believed he was a holy healer Who would heal her son  But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power became known to more and more people, the demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and louder.  "This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please" No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms Then one night some men of higher standing Set a trap, they're not to blame "Come to visit us" they kept demanding And he really came  RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen They put some poison into his wine RA RA RASPUTIN Russia's greatest love machine He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"  RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen They didn't quit, they wanted his head RA RA RASPUTIN Russia's greatest love machine And so they shot him till he was dead  Oh, those Russians...

      Hi ladybugs!  I needed to let go of myself  really  badly from all the stress. i shan't elaborate since it isn't necessary, hence, last night when i met  nora sweetheart  online, we decided to hang out today and have some gurly fun.  I took a cab to town then met her at 10.15am. we took stickers prints from 2 different machines at the annexe. 8 beam and this other new hee-uge machine. it's so model-like and seemed sophisticated. and in one of the snapshots i carried her! and she was really amazed by my sheer strength. anyhow, we bought tix to catch  charlies angels: full throttle  at 11am in cineleisure.. =P  it was soooo awesome ya!!  it  really  kicked butt. we were yakking all about it while we were on our way back to the heeren shops. afterwhich, we took prince machine sticker prints (which is the bessstt haha.) and went window shopping.. cause at that point i have already spent  $50 .. so yeah.. broke  again . waiting for nicco to return me $$ =\\ looked fer' necklaces.. adidas sweaters and a  urlLink ripcurl  sling bag.  nora  and i are gonna buy that sling bag together! hopefully by the time we save up...it's still being sold =D  dang.. we fell madly in love with it upon setting our eyes on it. nora and i have minds that are so alike. we keep sayin the same things at the exact same time. haha.   After everything, we proceeded to some mandarin hotel for a seminar.. then we saw  urlLink imran ! haha. it was sooo funny i tell ya. we went in and were strolling around the lobby when nora saw this malay boy in the  SJI  uniform. then she was all "oh my god, is that imran?" and we began freaking out. hahaa.. later she and i hugged each other goodbye.. =) we would be meeting in a month's time. teehee. oh yup, if you're wondering who nora is, well, we met through the help of  BARDOT ! haha. erm, cos we were once crazeee over bardot. then somehow we began chatting over the internet (and she had a website too) and decided to meet up one day. she's one of the many internet peeps i've met up with.. =) and i lub her. she lubs me too! *huggles*   Click below for sticker prints!  urlLink Sticker print 1   urlLink Sticker print 2

      Everything is going to be all right, why should I not be glad? to contemplate the clouds clearing beyond the dormer window and a high tide reflecting on the ceiling.  There will be dying, there will be crying,  but there is no need to go into that. The poems will flow from the heart unbidden and the hidden source is the watchful heart. The sun will rise despite everything and the far cities are beautiful and bright. I lie here in a riot of sunlight watching the daybreak and the clouds flying, everything is going to be all right

      I was devastated!! all I could think about was,  "why me" ? i just couldn't believe what was happening.. it was so unjustified. i plucked up my courage, spun around, and cleared my desk. i held my books on one arm and my bag in the other. i ambled across the classroom and settled down at the other side of the class. my new seating partner?  Joshua .  I have to  thank   yulun . for the past coupla' days, he has been teasing me about  "si-car-lly"  sitting with joshua. especially when we wenta' the mall that day. he was all, "  WHAT IF  you were to sit with joshua? what would you do?  i casually replied while laughing out loud,  "haha that is impossible! it can't be that coincidental right?"    Then this morning when i saw the new class seating plan, i nearly passed out. i was scanning the piece of paper. i finally saw my name. i was anxious to read the name of the person who would be sitting beside moi. very very nervous. everything seemed so...  slow motion-ed , and so dramatic.   Indeed , it turned out to be J-O-S-H-U-A.     Wow , life is overwhelmed with  irony , ain't it??   My life rocks .   Jiax  and i gave  ms halizah  the cold shoulder today. gave her attitude prob during her 5 lessons with us too. cos' basically, jiax can't sit with  jason (weihoong). they quarrel 24/7 and just can't get along. as for me, it is a fact that josh really is pretty dirty when it comes to personal hygiene =\ and i can't quite get along with him either. don't say i ain't trying, i have. we are okay together.. but, i can't open up to him like i do to  yulun . we don't joke, we don't talk, we don't laugh, we don't sing, we don't do anything together! and it really sucks if i have to sit with the same person for the entire day when we don't even communicate.  i miss yulun....  * bleahx*  well, not only did ms halizah put jiax and i with somebody whom we don't feel comfy around with, she put jiax,  fengrui (gabriel kor),  yulun (martin kor) and i each at a different corner. and  nic  is right at the centre.  kalyn (dingling) got to sit with fengrui. sighs. at least they can still talk..  amily  is sitting with  jeremy  kor. =( *sobs* how cool.  jess  sitting with  hafiz ,  ruth  and  simon . aaahhh.. my best friends are all so far away.. so so far away.  During the peer leaders and prefects' meeting after skl, jason told me that he has informed ms halizah about wanting to change his seats. he told her that he wouldn't mind sitting with me. so hopefully, ms halizah would put us together. i am praying SO hard that this would happen.

      This morning was pretty much lifeless cos' the first 2 periods were occupied by humanities. i enjoy history. yet i feel that it is boring. math was a total disaster. mr lee was absent. i hope he's ok.. heard that he's real sick. =\ the relief teachers seem to be tryin their best to teach and convey their msg to us.. however, it wouldn't work cos they have insufficient experience. they have absolutely  no idea  how to handle  young adults  (according to jiax) like us. scholars are smart. but so what if they're smart? some of them do not know how to apply the practical skills. this shows that  being intelligent isn't all . in this case, i'm talking about the new trainee teachers who are scholars. hopefully they'll be able to adjust themselves in this totally new environment. =) soon.  P.E was okaayy.. did conditioning once again cos' our physical fitness test is just around the corner! *eeks. 5 rounds.. and total 25 push ups and sit ups. then hadta' run another 7 rounds.. but penny ang said 2 can le. =) *hug hug* so nice. discount until so much. =P later.. english lessons.. quite boring =\\ physics was quite fun.  mr chin  likes to play with us. chinese was monsterous, since  liu jian  is always here to condemn and lecture us.   Bio was damn slack. we have a new teacher.  mrs chen . it was like a TPI lesson. she intro herself. made us intro ourselves. do some worksheet about ourselves. then write a list of friends + a word to describe them. asked her quesn. took up 2 periods.  viola , skl ended at 3pm. yay =)  Went home with  kalyn ,  ruth  and  yulun . he wanted me to go to westmall with him to buy puter parts. said tt if he didn't have enough $$, i can be his ATM machine. * tsk . couldn't find his stuff. boo. hmm. forced me to wait for the 173 bus with him. wait for sooo effin long. that yulun ah... he knows me too well. he knows tt i won't get angry with him, will always forgive him and can put up with his nonsense. he's like.. the one who can really make my day.. even when i'm damn depressed.. his  clone  conversation (inside joke) really cracks me up. oh wells, enough about the maniac. very tired.. gonna eat dinner (: tc guys!

      Friends matter the most to me. so if one of them would have to go away some day, i would happily let him/her go, although i'm going to be undeniably reluctant to. if letting them go makes them happy, i would be contented. the same goes for the special someone whom you love. i'm sure you'd want the best for him/her, wouldn't you? =)   i would.

       Dear Sonority,  The poem below was taken from this book by Sean Sheehan, "The Holocaust: The Death Camps". i borrowed it from the library today and began reading it as soon as i got home because it is  unbelievably  interesting. it is certainly depressing to know the harsh conditions people were living in though. not forgetting the macabre process of mass murder. * ewww .  I met up with Jeremy and Jason(weihoong) at school this morning to ask Miss Halizah questions on the holiday homework. she re-taught the entire chapter on moles and it helped us quite a bit. the problem with jeremy and i is that, we are  able  to memorise the fomula, BUT, we're not sure how to apply them to the questions. =\ so sucky right? hehe. ah well. anyhow! she went really slow and i managed to catch what she was explaining. not many people know the patient and soft side of Miss Halizah i guess. i myself was surprised! =)  After attempting the questions, we just sat there and chilled with her. talked crap and also watched the graduates strutting their stuffs hahaa! many of them dressed up really elegantly and formally. but like what miss halizah had mentioned, Singapore's proms can't be compared to the ones in the states/west where guys pick the girls up in their dad's car! haha! which is so true. anyways, they're still underage, and that kinda' stinks. my sister from crescent girls will be attending her prom night in several hours time. she bought this beautiful tube gown, dyed her hair, permed it and i don't know what else is she gonna do to herself, but i believe she'll look awesome tonight!! i'm so happy for her! she'll be staying over at The Oriental with her NCC mates too. all squeeze into 1 room. i bet it's gonna be one helluva' slumber party! teehee. i wouldn't mind getting drunk with my mates there if i were her.  I pity our graduates though. i pity myself too! graduation in school is rather..pathetic! yes, that's zee perfect word to describe the occasion and venue. hmm. we were discussing about how their make-up's gonna melt due to the uber hot weather. i saw almost everyone ambling into the school gate. mr hang dressed up for the occasion. mss koh too. miss shelley low especially! woah! she was, "radiant"! hehe. here is my pick for the best dressed! (dress+make up+attitude)   BEST DRESSED MALE:   Melvin Tan    BEST DRESSED FEMALE:  The tanned, slim, tall netballer with straight long hair. a pity i don't know her name!  It was so cool. huishan was standing near the gate with a camera crew (MRL). somewhat like the Star Awards!

       I keep forgetting   I keep forgetting the facts and statistics and each time i need to know them.  I look up books these books line twelve shelves in my room.  I know where to go to confirm the fact that in the Warsaw ghetto there were 7.2 people per room.  and how many bodies they crammed in Auschwitz at the peak of production.  twelve thousand a day i have to check and re-check...  and did i dream that at 4pm on the 19th January 58,000 emaciated inmates were marched out of Auschwitz.  ... i can remember people's conversations and what someone's wife said to someone else's husband.  what a good memory you have people tell me.  ( I keep forgetting by Lily Brett, quoted from Hilda Schiff  Holocaust Poetry  )

       Dear Sonority,  On  tuesday , Geetha invited Kalyn(dingling) and i over to her place to bake cookies. her aunt's secret cookie recipe is unbelievably enticing. YUMMY! we also had a manicure and peticure session. kalyn is like the expert in this area, she brought an entire set of buffer, nail cutter, etc! i was rather amused when i saw what she had brought along. haha. she taught me how to go about doing this and that and it was really interesting! i painted my toe nails black and coated them with layers of glittery sparkles, bearing in mind what my lil' sis had mentioned earlier, that i don't look too good in black varnish. "too gothic." but she said that by adding the glitter, it appears much more rad. geetha and kalyn looked wicked too! ;)    Yesterday  was special. i didn't have to go to school whatsoever, hence i just watched telly and chilled at home. i saw the "ice cream show" on the discovery travel and adventure channel and i'm  amazed  by the amount of ice cream the Americans consume! it's  scary    Today  was extemely productive. the dance practice went smoothly, although the beginning of the prac was uber lame! we couldn't find a suitable spot for the dance as the juniors were using the NP room. so val decided to proceed to the FIELD! so we danced in front of the express way and the HDB flats to be ridiculed at. how corny! we practiced for a lil' while before using the NP room cos' the juniors weren't quite ready yet. you know, always make use of your time wisely, don't waste precious moments. =) we danced like dunno how many donkey times and finally ended at about 10.30am. teehee. wenta' ask mr lee math questions and offered friends and teachers the cookies which geetha, kalyn and i had baked! mr azmi thought i was going to poison him. oooh, do i look like that type of person? sigh. haha! he was pretty comical. qingrui ate it. gerry too. all my squadmates and a coupla juniors did. (they commented on how yummy it was!) mr lee was the only teacher who happily munched on it. mr azmi ah...sigh X 10000!  Afterwhich, val, sir alan and i wenta' JP to watch " Rugrats go wild! " it's sucha kick-butt movie!! i noticed that i was one of the many who laughed away throughout the entire movie cos i'm a fan of The Wild Thornberrys and i think Debby ROCKS! (although seemingly bossy) while val and alan were like stoning while i'm laughing away...haha. but overall yes, it's smashing! (hehe again, inside joke by Nigel Thornberry!) i would give it a  4/5 . =)

       5 Easy Steps to Suicide Enlightenment   Did your boyfriend/girlfriend just break up with you, parents getting a divorce, have no friends, just got an f, these are all perfect reasons to end your life and all the suffering such things bring. Without further ado let's get the gun loaded and ready:   STEP 1: The first step to having a successful suicide attempt is to give off signals that you are becoming suicidal. That way when you pull the trigger, people feel more blame for having ignored your hints and then you affect even more people then just yourself. This is key to ending your worthless, hard life. The first thing you need to due is become anti-social. Friends going to the movies and then some ice cream? Not you, you are going to sit at home in the dark and listen to Dashboard Confessional, and when someone asks you what is wrong you will say "Nothing, I'm just tired", but when you say this, it is key that you give off the "I'm full of shit and want to kill myself look". Seclude yourself. Be pessimistic.   STEP 2: After giving off hints, it is time to confide in a friend or write letters and let your friends find them. When your friends address you and offer their help, make sure you deny it and again say "Nothing is wrong", be convincing this time, I don't want them to stop you from ending your life. When your parents get worried and start to pry into your personal life, give them the guilt trip and then go upstairs, lock yourself in your room, and make slits in your arm but make sure they are not noticeable and will only be seen by your friends. If your parents see this your attempt at riding the world of a dipshi....depressed person with a meaningless life will be ruined. RUINED, I TELL YOU. First 2 steps are easy enough, now comes the time to write your suicide note and pick your weapon of choice.  STEP 3: Make sure that you become such an outcast that people at school start to make fun of you. So when you finally end your life they feel the repercussions as well. Be sure a day or two before you do it that when someone blurts out "Hey fatty" you counter with "You know you could make someone kill themself with comments like that" and hope they say "Please kill yourself." If they say the that, it will be a great feeling you give them when they find out you did what they wanted. Also be sure to hit yourself or create some kind of pain when they call you names, so they think you are a freak. It is important that you create this loner image-- be sure to sell it.  STEP 4: Writing the suicide note is the most important thing. This are the last words people will remember you by. Since this is crucial I will give you a template suicide note and you can fill in the blanks where you see fit.     Dear insert name here,  I can't live with this sadness no longer. I needed to end the suffering before I affected others, it was the only way out of the pain. For "insert your age years" I have lived with this pain. Now it has come to a close and will no longer eat away at me.  Mom and Dad - it is not your fault, you guys were great even though I didn't get that $40,000 pony when I was 7, it wasn't that or the time you were 10 minutes late to pick me up from "insert best friend name". I love you guys and want you to know that it isn't your fault.  Boyfriends/ girlfriend's name - I love you, but how could you cheat on me with that stupid slut. After you told me we were going to get married. We had been going out 2 months and you just did that to me, but it isn't all because of you. We were gonna run away and live by the ocean and have a baby each day of our healthy lives. I knew I couldn't make anyone happy or even myself. Remember me forever and don't forget the precious times we had together.  Mom and Dad please don't cry over me, and I am sorry my "insert comment of how your body or guts will be found" the last thing I wanted to due was hurt anyone. However there was no other choice.   insert partial poem or quote about life  your name here     STEP 5: Copy that word for word and you will be sure to give your family members and loved ones the greatest gift of life. Now on to following through with your stu...suicide. I would suggest taking a gun to your temple or in the mouth it is the least painful and you will have a closed casket so no one has to see your "ugly ass" one last time. Also the walls will be stained with your blood which is the perfect everlasting memory to give to your parents. Be sure to have a picture of your parents and you near the scene of the suicide to add to the effect. If you find that too gruesome or do not have a handgun readily available, then I suggest hanging yourself when your parents leave and do it right in front of the front door, so when they get back from "ignoring their picture perfect child" they will see your body swaying side to side. This will make them feel even more responsible because they left you alone. We all know that you should never leave your kid alone at home. If you do not feel like doing this then swallow some kind of poison or pills or slit your wrist, however I highly recommend one of the first two options; the others are not as gruesome and do not have as much lasting affect.  If you are considering committing suicide or you know someone who wants to, please let them read this so they can get through it and end their life. The easy way out is not to be a reasonable person and realize that shit happens and move on, but to kill yourself. Realize there are no other options and get on with the show. Also if you could record it and have the tape sent to me that would be awesome. If you have problems pulling the trigger remember Nike...Just do it. So what are you waiting for...CLICK CLICK BOOM.

       Dear Sonority,  Wow. read  urlLink this  article. my mom showed me one similar to it. how dumb is that? i wonder who were the "mature" little snots who thought they were so cool thinking up that kind of crap..c'mon! they're just meaningless little bracelets that have absolutely no purpose or point. honestly, the bracelets aren't the issue..it's the lack of parenting and all the sexin' going on these days by kids so young.   By the way, they aren't called "Sex bracelets" in Singapore if i'm not wrong? from what nic and eileen had mentioned to me earlier, they're called "F*** bracelets". ahaha! nice one.

       Dear Sonority,   A  Jonny Wilkinson  drop-goal in the final minute of extra time secured the first ever Rugby World Cup win for England  20-17  over the Wallabies, in a pulsating Final at  Telstra Stadium in Sydney  last night. After being the focus of attention for practically the entire tournament, Wilkinson – under extreme pressure -- slotted the decider to secure the Webb-Ellis Cup for the Martin Johnson-led English. It followed a titanic fight-back from the Wallabies who went close to becoming the first team to defend a Rugby World Cup title and the first to come back after trailing at the half in a Final. England led 14-5 at the break after tries to Lote Tuquiri for Australia and Jason Robinson for England. The scores had been locked at  14-14 at full-time , after  Elton Flatley  kicked a dramatic last-minute penalty to draw Australia level. Flatley had earlier kicked two second-half penalties to close gap to three points. England led 17-14 after Wilkinson's fourth penalty early in the first period of extra time. But Flatley replied with another last-gasp penalty to level the scores again at 20-20 before Wilkinson clinched the decider in the last minute of extra-time. It was only the second time a RWC Final had gone to extra-time, securing  England's first every championship , and the first for northern hemisphere teams in Rugby World Cups. Australia's epic performance was also widely acknowledged, despite being the Wallabies' first ever loss in a Final.   ENGLAND AUSTRALIA   20  (14) Score  17  (14) Jason Robinson Tries Lote Tuquiri Cons  Jonny Wilkinson 4 Pens Elton Flatley 4  Jonny Wilkinson Drop-Goals     The match was incredibly exciting, although i was rather disappointed that the Wallabies (Australia) were defeated. i felt as though i was a part of England because when they were on stage victorious, tears welled up in my eyes, and i thought i was about to cry. i was touched, and felt elated for the English. to those who have missed the  urlLink Rugby World Cup  finals between England and Australia, be sure to catch the encore telecast if there is one.

       Dear Sonority,  I am still enjoying the after effects of all the fun I had at  Mr Lee's BBQ  party last night. i was physically drained, but mentally awake although i was in bed at 12 midnight..haha. i had to force myself to sleep. =\   Anyways, Mr Lee met up with Wenxing, nic(amelia), simon, jeremy and i at IMM in the afternoon and bought our BBQ essentials. he drove us to his place and the guys ganged up against me. made me sit in front with Mr Lee. it was kinda' embarrasing cos' they wouldn't stop teasing me..especially simon and wenxing! *grrrr!!!* how annoying can those silly fellas get? at one point when it was really sunny, mr lee helped me put down the shade above me, then wenxing was all " did you all see that? " that freaking a**h*** said it so loudly and they were all cracking up then mr lee was like " see what? " all blur. my gosh, i swear i could've kicked wenxings balls then. *grr!* so paiseh..  The entire BBQ went really well. the weather was awesome and everything went on smoothly although there was an excess in food. wenxing was so frustrated cos' he couldn't cut the stingray! haha! cut until the knife BENT! another hilarious scene was while preparing food before the rest arrived, mr lee tried to cut the corn using the knife and the corn was flying all over the place! he didn't succeed in cutting them so i was like, "you don't help out in the kitchen at home do ya?" and he was like "yaa!" with a grin flashed across his cheeks. haha!  We had a "moon-tan" and caught up with one another. geetha, karen, eileen, peiwen, dingling, gerry and i tried to push our girlfriends down * eh hem * while strolling at the edge of the pool. haha! mission unaccomplished though, and gerry and geetha slipped and fell on their butts!  oouuccch!!  we all broke out in laughter. tehee. those poor lil' souls who fell on their butts.  Mr Lee had chats with all of us and we kept asking him about his sons. so we finally went upstairs and i think he asked his son to come out...but he was all shy, and so were we. so never talk to him. * aww ..* but he is   really  good-looking . he has the  ACS(I)+outdoor sporty+smart+skater  look. very cheeky face too. (btw, he skates! so hip hop rite?) and according to ruth, he is in ACS(I). so like, wow, ellidegable bachelor huh? but seriously jess, he's much cuter than your  tuna ! keke..just kidding. don slaughter me.   After a looooong day, daddy picked ruth, dingling, yulun and i up at about 10pm..sooo exhausted! keke, if you're interested to see some of zee photos, click  urlLink HERE ! haha. had heaps of fun and we have to thank Mr and Mrs Lee for this awesome party. =D  So long mates! tata!

       Dear Sonority,  I had a haircut! actually, i had it trimmed and layered. however, according to my sis(cherryn), it looks the same. i also bought black nail varnish and it looks really gothic. then serene says it doesn't suit me. i tried to remove it, but the varnish seems to have gone under my nail!? arrrgh! i think i need some help here..  Anyways, i'm really anxious about tomorrow's campcraft selection. i'm not afraid of  not  getting into the team, i'm just, nervous that it might be too tough to handle. another cause of worry would be the attendance of my squad and my juniors. we are expected to pump 10 times for every NCO who doesn't turn up. and 8 of them didn't turn up during the previous training. *gulps*  I did  urlLink this  cos' i felt like i didn't have a life. * boredom envelops pearls *

       Spare a thought for Mrs Lee:   Senior Minister Lee continues to worry for Singapore, at the ripe age of 80, when many of his peers have retired and are enjoying life. We continue to benefit from his views, so if his wife is not all right, he is not going to be able to focus. From what i read, Mrs Lee took care of the family while Mr Lee took care of the nation. any married man will tell you that that takes a lot of sacrifice. cost of medical treatment for Mrs Lee? At this time we should be asking, "Mrs Lee, are you feeling better?"  --  The Straits Times   It is ironical that some Singaporeans should question the integrity of SM Lee. it is indeed very sad. sigh. hopefully both SM and Mrs Lee recovers speedily.

       Dear Sonority,   Geetha, Jessica, Ruth and i hit the gym this late morning to shed off some calories after history lessons. we met up with Amelia in the noon to check out the prices of the BBQ essentials and cracked up at every lilttle thing we talked about. it was difficult to make a choice between the two bottles of wine we saw, which we thought would make an excellent gift for Mr Lee. both wine bottles looked incredibly exquisite. Geetha mentioned that yam biscuits would be suitable for him whereas Jess felt that Yun Nam haircare vouchers were more benifitting. i thought it would be a GREAT idea to leave   our   mobile phone numbers in a box of ferrero rocher for his 3 sons.  Regarding my previous post, difficult times have helped me to understand better than before, how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way.    urlLink Chuang Tzu  quotes, "Flow with whatever is happening and let your mind be free. stay centered by accepting whatever you are doing. this is the ultimate."

       Dear Sonority,   Life at this stage of my life is pretty different...  Have you ever encountered a specific point in life whereby this huge change occurs in yourself you don't even realise what you're doing, whether or not it hurts your friends, family members or even yourself? sometimes, you're doing it because it provides support for your ego and sometimes you stay in that position out of sheer inertia because others expect it of you.   I hope that no one hates or holds a grudge against me. cos nobody is truly perfect. ultimately humans will never be perfect, maybe 99% but not 100%.  Just like a diamond, i hope i will be polished into a better person...

       Dear Sonority,   I WAS drunk last night at my cousin's only after drinking a teeny weeny bit of alcohol while enjoying the rugby match. and i'm suprised there was no typo in that post or should i say 'short statement.' ignore the previous entry, it doesn't seem to make sense. "heart-poundingly"? what was i thinking? and also when i think sober, i talked a lot, to a lot of people and now i 'kinda' regret it.  The regret that makes u go "i ain't drinking and talking after it no more!"

      "You sound like an orgastic trumpet." "You can say that again." --My sisters, apparently trying to tell me how i sound like while blowing my nose.   Oh alcohol..sweet heavenly alcohol.  Thank you for being so accepting and for everything you do to my body.   Gotta go and catch some sleep..a few hours left. Heart-poundingly.. is there even such a word?!..

       The Sound of Silence    Hello darkness, my old friend,  I've come to talk with you again,  Because a vision softly creeping,  Left its seeds while I was sleeping,  And the vision that was planted in my brain  Still remains  Within the sound of silence.  In restless dreams I walked alone  Narrow streets of cobblestone,  'Neath the halo of a street lamp,  I turned my collar to the cold and damp  When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light  That split the night  And touched the sound of silence.   And in the naked light I saw  Ten thousand people, maybe more.  People talking without speaking,  People hearing without listening,  People writing songs that voices never share  And no one dare  Disturb the sound of silence.   "Fools" said I, "You do not know  Silence like a cancer grows.  Hear my words that I might teach you,  Take my arms that I might reach you."  But my words like silent raindrops fell,  And echoed  In the wells of silence   And the people bowed and prayed  To the neon god they made.  And the sign flashed out its warning,  In the words that it was forming.  And the sign said, "The words of the prophets  are written on the subway walls  And tenement halls."  And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.    The Sound of Silence  -- Simon & Garfunkel

       Dearest Sonority,   I'm red and hot all over. the weather today is  aggravating . first it was all uuubber hot in the early part of the day i swear i could've walked around the house naked (but i didn't cos i wasn't alone at home). then it rained cats and dogs abruptly like nobody's business in the evening. (o'_'o) gee.  Anyways, i seriously think there is something wrong with my skin. one reason why i turn red, or in simpler words,  blush  easily, could be due to the dilation of my arterioles located near the surface of my skin. on the other hand, my blood capillaries and arterioles could be just a hair's breadth from my skin! (although it may sound rather ridiculous)  yet if that isn't the case, then why is it that i get red and tanned easily?   While we were training for the campcraft competition under the scorching hot sun this morning/noon, we had to carry our metal pegs and run around the tracks on the field at the same time. i was holding one peg and a mallot on the other so that slowed me down and i got pretty exahausted before my face became bright  red . once again,  sir benghui   had  to make fun of me in hokkien.. but it's not like i have total control over what my body does right? aiii. in addition, during one particular npcc meeting that was held in the np room,  mr lau  came in and spoke to us and asked why my face was red. he  actually   thought  that i had make up on.  Another time when ruth, jessica and i wento sentosa beach during one of the marking days, ruth and i got so badly burnt that when i went to school a few days later, taufiq and the guys called me "lobster" and all kinds of 'funny' names. haha..but it was incredibly horrifying then? cos' my face swelled up and i had to see a doctor. ruth even ran a fever and got me so worried. when we returned to school (reluctantly) after days of rest, people wanted to help peel our skins cos they  assumed  that it was  fun . hurhurr.   On a brighter note, japanese cucumbers are awesome as it helps to cool and at the same time, whitens and brings glow to your face.   Method:  1. Peel off the skin and put it in the fruit juice extractor 2. Mix the paste and juice together 3. Add a little fresh milk/olive oil 4. Dip in cotton wool and put it onto your face for 10 minutes 5. Clean off with water  Have fun trying that out! :) peace out. xox.   P.S : You know you want to see  urlLink this .

       "Variation on the Word Sleep"   I would like to watch you sleeping,  which may not happen. I would like to watch you, sleeping.  I would like to sleep with you, to enter your sleep  as its smooth dark wave slides over my head and walk with you through that lucent  wavering forest of bluegreen leaves  with its watery sun & three moons  towards the cave where you must descend,  towards your worst fear.  I would like to give you the silver branch,  the small white flower,  the one word that will protect you  from the grief at the center of your dream,  from the grief at the center.  I would like to follow you up the long stairway  again & become the boat that would row you back carefully,  a flame in two cupped hands  to where your body lies beside me,  and you enter it as easily as breathing in.  I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only.  I would like to be that unnoticed & that necessary.

       Dear Sonority,  i'm like SO glad my net is fixed..finally. i can keep up with people then. i'm really excited cos i'm gonna put up a new layout! this one is a lil' depressing.   i've been playing with my guitar and composing music with serene lately. she is sucha' great song-writer! i have so much to catch up on hey. i really gotta learn the skills. yesterday,  jiax  and i hit the malls and caught the movie,  "ong-bak" . it is excellent. then i wenta music concerto to check out the array of courses they had.  "VOCAL"  lessons. ah! $78 per month for 3 months for the basic course. do you think it would be worth it to sign up? everyone thinks it's kinda' er...useless, but i truely love singing. music is my life.  in addition, i have been actively involved in  npcc  at school, because exams are over and i am an NCO (not officially though). i love my life right now. it's so...productive. whenever i am free, i either read, play the guitar, work out or revise my school work. hopefully i will be able to do the same..now that my internet is back.  take care ya'll. *huggles*

          Good charlotte - Riot girl   The latest: 1).  urlLink Iran quake death toll hits 28,000  2).  urlLink HK pop star Anita Mui dies  3).  urlLink China confirms Sars case   So many things have been happening lately.. whether sad, or happy. That is why I believe that it is essential to count our blessings and remind ourselves constantly of how lucky we are. Even if it is as simple as having a roof over our heads, it should not be taken for granted. Take the earth quake in Iran for example. Although it did not affect us, Singaporeans, greatly, we should think of the less fortunate, feel for them, and we even can do our part by praying for them. Thus, I have decided to create a  urlLink blog  whereby I write down 3 blessings a day. It is a a great way for all of us to get into the habit of counting our blessings and appreciating life. I sincerely hope you all will join me in doing it.

          Sum 41 - Motivation   Yeehaw! I feel soo GOOD. I just got back from a swim and a sauna at my Dad's club. Sundays are wicked cos' your parents finally get a day off to spend time with the kids.   Anyways,  Christmas celebration  was marvellous. My family and I stayed home and had a scrumptious Christmas dinner YUMMY...  We watched The Christmas Wish and cracked up so badly.. And I suppose I could tell you about my Christmas pressies :P Mainly food la. Honey roasted almonds chocolate galore... Gosh! Haha.. There are like brownies, cookies, HEAPS of chocolates that could last me for years (*Teehee*), cool clothes from OP picked by my Mom and Dad! (*Huggles*) Earings, bracelets and stuff like that. I am so thankful for everything that I have received.   On the 26th, a buncha' NPCC peeps from my school and tss went to West Coast Park for a BBQ. It was ather amusing! Senior edwin brought twines along and made use of it when it started pouring by building a shelter with a canvas sheet. Glad am I that he was around! And thanks to Val and Xiongster for organising this activity! Thanks for all the presents too..  Yesterday was my Granny's 75th birthday and I had forgotten all about it until my lil' sister rang me up on my mobile. I had only 30 minutes to rush home before they leave the house and I was at bras brasah with my seniors. So I had to take a cab home. And.. *heaves a sigh of relief* I managed to reach home just in time. On a lighter note, my couzzie's girlfriend happens to be from ct as well. I think her name is Liting. Graduated last year. She's very amiable and angelic. :D I love being with my relatives. They are so easy-going and cranky, especially Auntie Enjaneek. *Muaks*   Take care everyone. Make good use of the remaining days of the holidays. Til then, xox.

          Stacie orrico - More to life   Don't know why, I just wanna spend a quiet christmas at home with my family, enjoy my Dad's white wine, feast, watch telly and get some good decent sleep.   I feel strangely subdued, I just want to be alone this evening, away from all the noise, the endless complaining and whinning. I want a peaceful christmas, listening to my Christmas songs and tv programmes. I got lotsa' new year resolutions this coming 2004... but before that, I would like to retreat into my tiny shell and not hear a single thing from the world outside.   Wham's "Last Christmas" was playing on my PC just now, reminds me of how crazy I used to be over the 80s. Haha. I love the 80s!!!! Big hair, bright colour clothes, big dangling earrings... and Madonna writhing in "Like A Virgin" video. Pop was good then...

          Green day - Minority   Nora and I headed to town today and wenta' fish and co. for lunch. The food was fab, and so was the ambience. The restaurant played all my favourite songs too.. *Laadeedaaa* We took 2 sticker prints, unfortunately, I can't scan them out because my scanner is stuffed up, so I can only upload them when Nora comes online tonight. On our way home, we thought of a brilliant idea to swop mobile phones so now, I am a proud owner of a white  urlLink SGH-S200 ! :) It's sucha nifty phone and I'm in love with it! Nora hearts my pink nokia 2100 too! By the way, Ignatious, we do not belong to the  sorority sluts  okie.. how mean of you to think that we belong to that group. *Sniffles* :,( Ahaha ok kidding lar little boy :P I just found it rather amusing when Nora told me about it. Huhur.  I miss my classmates.. Jeremy, Jason, Jessica, Amily, Dingling, Geetha, Jiax, Amelia, Karen, Simon, Ruth, Eileen, Gerry, Siti, Zu, Fiona, Narin, and everybody else. Can't wait for school to re-open! But I haven't completed my homework. Geez.

          The all american rejects - Why worry   Reuben is super duper cool because he's buying me  urlLink this  Slick Shoes album for Christmas! Talking about Christmas pressies, I went Christmas shopping a coupla' days back and bought heaps of chocolates, soft toys, flowers, cards and earings. I don't really mind spending all that I've got in my piggy bank because Christmas is all about giving... and sharing... and being happy.  Yesterday's campcraft training showed improvement in terms of our team spirit and the quality of our tents! I am incredibly impressed by our never give up spirit. Seniors beng, xiongster, edwin all played in the mud.. barefooted. Haha. So gross I tell ya! But it seemed rather fun.. and Jolene kept whining because she wanted to join in the fun by taking off her shoes too. Nana and I were craving for food by the time training ended so we went to BB's Mac and bought ice cream! YUMMMY! She bought bubblegum flavour while I purchased my all time favourite, HOT FUDGE!   Val, Pinky, Faizal, Beng and I caught  Lord of the rings . Yay like finally! I was desperate to see it. The movie was  marvellous . The sceneries were jaw-dropping and the hunks and babes were all so adorable.  Must see it .. :) Faizola and Beng met me below my block to return me $ and we talked quite a bit before returning home for dinner. I didn't want to go back up so soon actually. I should've walked them to the bus stop. I have so much to say.

          Good charlotte - Wondering   I have this little box  Filled with memories of you. Sometimes I open it  And remember the times we shared.   It makes me feel whole, just as much as empty,  Happy, just as much as sad,  And, loved just as much as lonely.    As I pick up the scattered memories,  I feel as though I am picking up  Pieces of my heart.   I smell them, feel them,  Touch them, and remember them.    When I put them together,  I feel as though as I am constructing a mold of my heart,  Replacing each piece of the frame.   Every time I open the box,  The frame gets stronger and less fragile.    It makes me smile to know that  At one time I was loved and that I loved.   Many pieces remind me of the pain you gave me,  But with sorrow and grief... comes power and triumph  And I feel as though I have won.    You may have broke my heart  But you taught me something;  If you love someone, really really love them,  Love will give you the strength to let them go.

          Dashboard confessional - So impossible   According to Val, Sir Faizal wants us to wait for him to return from NS (Taiwan) before watching the  Lord of the rings: The return of the king . However, I'm way too ecstatic to and I'm intoxicated with my sisters because they keep talking about it. I have no idea when is he coming back and I've gone ape! So if I happen to feel an extreme itch, I  will  not hesitate to catch the movie without waiting! But I'll trrry my very best. Haha.   On a brighter note, my parents have arrived safely! My father mentioned that it was one of my mom's elite holidays. I'm glad that they relished their stay there, because eversince my mom had stopped working at MOE and transferred herself to work as an admin manager in a school, she has been too caught up with work to even spend quality time with us. She rarely smiled, and has become so 'blur'. Now that she's back, she's all smiley smiley!  :)  Yet I'm quite sure she misses her work. She's such an efficient worker, she does her typings on the computer at home and revises her 'homework' as well. I am so proud of her. Oh yes! My mom and dad bought us such adorable keychains for our mobiles, and also bought other stuff such as handphone pouches, scarves, winter clothing,  bracelets  and handbags. And it's amazing, the stories they've related. Life at the moment is so fulfilling.  I am learning , to be grateful for all the things in life. It means to be thankful and express admiration... It also means to grow or appreciate in value. As you  appreciate life , you become more valuable, both to yourself and others.

Anyways, have you guys seen ' The making of the Lord of the rings ' on Channel news asia just a while ago? It was incredibly nifty! I absolutely cannot wait to see it in the theatres. *Girly screams* I'm glad my parents are returning home from their business trip tonight because i need some cash urgently. They didn't leave us with any money when they left for China. *Sniffles* But i survived. Ooh yes i did. Mwaha. Then maybe i could catch the movie with Val and all.

           Reliant K - Pressing on        STILL STANDING:  urlLink SANDRA  IS SOLE SURVIVOR         Thirty-nine days, 16 castaways, four tribes, dozens of broken alliances, a quitter,  a grandmother who isn't really dead , and now, one Sole Survivor!  Sandra Diaz-Twine , the 29-year-old office assistant from Ft. Lewis, Washington, captured the million-dollar prize. In the gut-wrenching final Tribal Council, Sandra pleaded to the Jury that she went along with whatever alliance would have her without asking questions. Sandra claimed she never got in anyone's way, staying quietly in the background, and that she deserved to be the Sole Survivor. The Jury agreed in a  6 to 1 decision , making Sandra the Sole Survivor and the recipient of the one million dollar prize.    urlLink More...    SURVIVOR  was TEH B3ST! I was hoping that Darrah or Sandra would win, and Sandra did. She definitely deserved the million dollars. I respect her utmostly, especially her incredibly truthful and straightforward personality. In addition, she is the only sole survivor in the  entire  series who has NOT EVEN  ONE  vote casted against her!!! Amazed? YES!  I hate to be judged so I try my outmost best not to judge people... as I always believe there is more to the physical. Like what Shaun has mentioned, there seems to be different aspects of depiction of every character in the game. For example, the more triumph moments of RUPERT BONEHAM!

       Dear Sonority,   I thought i'd share the joke which i came across the internet after watching Michael Jackson's home vids :)    A little kid asks his father, "Daddy, is God a man or a woman?"  "Both son. God is both."   After awhile the kid comes again and asks, "Daddy, is God black or white?"  "Both son, both." "Daddy, does God love children?"   "Yes son, he loves all children."   The child returns a few minutes later and says, "Daddy, is Michael Jackson God?"     Anyways! today was THA' B0MB! val, xiongster, beng, edwin, meiyi, yati and myself gave ourselves a common surname because we belonged to the similar 'family'! so now we're called the " dabeaches ". don't ask how we came up with that name, we just did. we headed to siloso beach for a kick-butt outing! it was mad..you can read it at val's OD too. we soaked in the sea and played silly coconut bomb games. then val and i played some kayaking water-polo(?) game with a buncha cuuute boys. yes an emphasis on the cute. we were kayaking around the area when we accidentally bumped into their kayaks so later they approached and asked if we wanted to play. at first we ignored them and kayaked away. haha. but since they asked a coupla' times, we obliged. teehee. and! kana beng's super power sand ball! * bish !* oouch..haha. val and i did brainless stunts such as impersonating kate winslet and leonardo dicarprio in a titanic scene. edwin and all also dug a hee-uge hole and burried val in it as an xmas gift for her! haha. her entire body ached so badly after a bashing. that poor soul. oohs you had no idea how much i enjoyed myself today :D

       Dear Sonority,   It's time for the Friday five.   1. Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays?  Where's the snow? i'm living in a tropical country. we don't have snow here, teehee. but i'm dreaming that someday it will snow. we do have a cold weather. yet i don't quite like the monsoon season. storms are scary. okay, you get the drift.   2. What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?  I usually celebrate Christmas with my family, loved ones, relatives and friends. we have this yearly family reunion. it's held at our grandparents' place/s, where there are lots of christmas goodies, foods and gifts; and where everybody is happy :)   3. Do you do have any holiday traditions?  Nope!   4. Do you do anything to help the needy?  Yupp. i donate money and old stuff to the salvation army.   5. What one gift would you like for yourself?  LOVE and HAPPINESS :)

       Dear Sonority,   I've been vomitting and diareough-ing(sp?) for the past 2 days..i couldn't eat. so i lost quite a bit of weight. i'm quite certain that i'll gain back those few pounds though. haha. i'm presently feeling better already. but everytime i stand up i feel naseous.   Anyways, about Bali.. it was a great place. however, the first night was rather shocking. there was a flood after we touched down at about 10pm and my sister, cherryn, lost her luggage. things got worse as when we were on our way to our hotel, "kuta paradiz" (aka kuta paradiso hotel)...the jeep we were in broke down cos water went into the exhaust pipe (due to flood). it was an eye-opener..seeing people who live on the road sides sweep water out of their homes because you NEVER see that happen in Singapore. fortunately, a few teenage boys came around to help us. they pushed our transport about 200m to our hotel and ironically, seemed to enjoy being drenched.   The next morning, we received news that my sister's luggage was found and was on its way to Bali in a Singapore airline. it wasn't removed from the cargo and was flown to Sydney. 2nd day was more of a relaxation thing..cos we strolled at the beach, went swimming, played pool, went shopping and all. we also had dinner by the beach. it was simply relaxing..  3rd day was pretty much hectic. we managed to get this really nice taxi driver, uncle wayan, to take us around Bali. he drove us in a huge toyota jeep to many places. we saw the kecap dance, went to silverware shops, art museum, the monkey forest, some mountains which was terribly cold. haha. so we were out for more than 12 hours today. so bumped out! ;P oh yes, we also went to the specific area of the Bali bombings, also known as Ground zero. am i right? it was crowded..many vehicles. there were tee-shirts hung on gates with the words "F*** TERRORISTS". we also met an australian lady at the beach who had that tee-shirt on. they sell it at every market in Bali. built at the memorial site was a huge wall which had the names of the deceased carved. * sniffles * i feel for them.  We had breakfast the next day as usual and went for a swim before departing. wenta' Pacung mountain resort at a mountain. it was cool. about 22 degrees celsius. we took about 2-3 hours before arriving. the scenery is absolutely amazing. again, it was an eye-opener! the resort and our bungalow over-looked the padi fields. and unlike the pictures depicted in the lower sec geography text books of the terrace thingies, the ones that i saw at the mountain was nothing like that. it was just undoubtedly....BEAUTIFUL.  At this point..i was already sick. i had a sore throat and runny nose. so my mom could only feed me with heaps of vitamins. haha. i think i've never had so much...fun before. we spent heaps of quality time together as a family. teehee. i wish those moments would never ever end. we all just layed at the couches at the lounge and talked and talked. then we could hear the farmers singing at 9pm + at night. the ambience was incredibly awesome. soo amiable :) so sweet. so relaxing. so pleasant. so positively-everything.  The last day of our tour approached quickly and it was time to leave Mount kinta-something. haha sorry i haven't got all the names of our destinations right (except for Bali) cos' i'm still in a state of being nauseous. anyhow, we left for the airport and then arrived in Singapore at about 6pm.  HOME SWEET HOME! i was really glad to be back cos' i needed to see a doctor urgently. unexpectedly, my sisters and i started passing out u-know-what and vomitted many times. my mom brought us to the doctor at about 10, 11pm + and the doctor confirmed that i had a flu virus and food poisoning. * double sigh * so now i'm just resting and recuperating at home. i didn't eat for 42 hours..just drank water and glucose. haha. quite an accomplishment i would say! but the abdominal cramps are really..like pain until wanna die that type. yeah.. but they always say,  "there will always be sunshine after a rainy day."  (quoted by mr lee. teehee) hence, i assume that something sweet will be coming my way.   This trip has been one of the most enriching so far. i believe it's because i've grown up. okay not exactly but i've grown a lil' more as compared to the past years. i've seen, with my own eyes, the lives of the extremely poor Balinese and those who have an average-income, just like uncle wayan. i guess uncle wayan is already quite fortunate to secure himself with a job. though so, he has to support his family (2 daughters) by working as a taxi driver (day time) AND a cashier at a hotel (night time). he has only 5 hours of sleep daily. he  really  is a good man. anyone going to bali in future, give me a ring and i'll let you know his contact number if you need a ride around Bali. anyways, i've learnt much more..but it'll take me forever to type it all out. i presume you guys know what i mean. all these takes true experiences to comprehend. no matter how horrible or how kick-arse my written reflections are in my blog, you will unable to understand the TRUE meanings..  On a lighter note, take care my friends, and have fun, as...TIS' THE SEASON TO BE HAPPY! :D

       Dear Sonority,   Today is my 3rd  and  last day of work. miss chua said that there isn't anything left to do since we've completed coding and checking all the o level mother tongue scripts. cherryn insisted on staying to help, whereas i suggested not surrendering our temp staff passes to the security. time passes really quickly at work hey, especially when you're enjoying every moment of it! :) besides, the pay is extremely satisfying. $5.60 per hour. you can't find any other job which pays you this much, is fully air-conditioned, has kind and helpful staff and supervisors, provides comfortable office chairs tables for your own use, 2 tea-breaks + 1 lunch break, free tea and coffee, sparkling clean rest rooms, can listen to discman and slack a bit after working for a long time and can work at your own pace one leh.. MOE ROCKS!!! haha. aiight..sue me....mwaha! Went through the o level chinese paper today..quite badly done sia. for my batch of scripts, majority failed and scrapped through the passing mark. the minority scored higher than 55/80. i'm quite worried about next year when it comes to our turn.   YESTERDAY  was the  ROD  for our unit's NPCC. haha. seniors weipo, yati and bernard graduated from our unit's NPCC le..haha. 3 cheers for our kick-arse seniors! * woot !* i'm very happy for them! and i'll miss them heaps!!  yati, bernard  and  weipo  rocks my socks!!! jiayou in the future CI courses!  I'll post the pictures up as soon as i upload them all :)

       Dear Sonority,  S$45 X 4DAYS = S$180. I've finally realised the value of money.   Anyways! today's my very  1st day at work . basically, my sister, her friends, senior xiongster and i have to report to work at 8.30am daily at MOE (tiong bahru examination branch) to do  coding . it's fairly simple. we handled the O level malay and tamil papers today. copying and checking of marks. heaps of paper work. the staff there are really nice though! they gave us tea-breaks, spoke to us patiently and taught us how to go about doing stuff right :) i would say 45 bucks is good money! snr xiongster and i are gonna eat rice tmrw. definitely! heh. cos we were still hungry after eating a bowl of S$2 meepok today. it was wicked, yet a rather small portion, considering our big bellies! we ended work at 5pm and i don't know why i'm still feeling quite pschyed! but at the same, pretty much beat, cos' i woke up in the middle of the night at 3.30am to look for food *oops!* then at 6am to get ready for work. i also have a muscle ache from the sat's monkey bar.   On a brighter note, i can't wait for tmrw's passing out parade. *Woot!* :D til' then, keep loving!

          BBMak - Out of my heart    I love everything I do... But somehow I have gone nuts over  people  and things. I realise how funny I get myself into sometimes.  When I doubt something will happen... it will happen. If I want it to happen no matter how miraculously hard I try.. it never falls perfectly.   Mrs Chua makes a perfect class parent. Unfortunately, she's only our English teacher. If only... =)   On a deeper thought, all the time, I believe that there is always more to the physical. Don't you ever judge a book by its cover. Mrs Tan needs to learn to understand our class. She can't just go around pretending that she 'cares' for our class when all she does is brings us down with her critisisms and negative judgements.  So it is today that a smile kills me.    "Too often we under estimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around."  -- Leo Buscaglia

          Simple plan - Perfect    This is sucha depressing song, it just makes me all the more guilty and forlorn.   I went to school for NPCC training, which is unusual because today is the 3rd day of Chinese New Year. On the other hand, most people would know how committed I am to my CCA, so yupp, it definitely isn't a chore to go when I can interact with my little kids. (Haha, sir Faizal I stole your word :P) Honestly speaking, I love my sec 3s. At first I didn't think that way because I  thought  I would be unable to handle them. But I've made a promise to myself that I am going to do my best in training them to become outstanding NCOs in the near future. As the quote by George Soros goes, " Once we realize that imperfect understanding is the human condition, there is no shame in being wrong, only in failing to correct our mistakes. " No matter how many/few mistakes they've made in the past, as long as they are all willing to learn from them and not commit them again, I would already be satisfied.   I yearn for them to grow up and become good people in the future, serve the nation, be loyal to Singapore, never stop learning and give their best in whatever they do, because as much as I am giving out my 110% in disciplining them, I hope that they will give me their 110% as well.  Training ended not-very-nicely. The Sec 3s were planning to sing Junior Jolene a birthday song, yet I screwed it up by losing a Casio watch which I had borrowed from a Sec 1 cadet. I passed it to Hafiz who was in-charge of one of the stations cos he didn't have a timer, and he brought it to the toilet and left it there. Before we could find it, it was gone.. We combed the entire school thrice, reported to the general office too. No news. * Sighs * I feel  really  bad for losing the watch.. It costs S$60. =\ Val forked out $10 while I paid the kid $50. Also wrote a letter to his parents informing them that I will take full responsibility. Val is right though, money can't solve all problems. I just hope that someone finds the watch..  Somehow....  Somewhere...

          Jewel - Stand       4B1 ROCKS ME AND MY SOCKS!!!     Oh my goose! Today has been so incredibly enjoyable! We came in  2nd  at the Chinese New Year Singing competition! Honestly speaking, although we were rather disappointed that we did not come in 1st, we accepted the results quickly, because our competitors, Christine, Jiamin and Selina really kicked out butts! I ain't kidding, they were much better than us in terms of vocals.. but of course, our creativity is better than anyone else la.. multi-racial somemore! Teehee.. But nonetheless, everyone was in high spirits and on cloud nine! We have learnt so much about one another during the past weeks of consistent practice, and the fact that we have bonded in one way or another has been such an awesome and inspiring experience. I promise, I will never forget the times we've spent together, the fun times, and the not so fun times.  Weizheng ,  Jason hoongy ,  Ruth ,  Siti ,  Jessica  and  Geetha , YOU GUYS ROCK! A big thank you to our 'stage managers', Jiaxin and Wenxing as well.. Haha! Our supporters.. I love you guys!   What a way to start the new year! We also ate "Yu Sheng" and "Lao" with the chopsticks until there was veggie all over our bodies!! Ahahah! Jiax prepared it with her mom. Thanks babe! The guys were very high, threw the veggie everywhere.. Mdm Liu had veggie on her arms.. HAHA.  Mrs Rajah  also gave me a box of chocolates for CNY.. I think cos i got her chocs for X'mas :) while  Mr Lee  got me a box of tissue?! Teeehee, to clean my hands. A pity I wouldn't be able to go to his place to "bai nian" because I would be with my family for the next few days. We took pics together as well, I shall upload them asap!  Wenta' town with the chicks after school to take sticker prints and lunch.. YUMMY! Had jap food :D I'll be leaving for my granny's in a while. I love new years! Hope you guys collect heaps of "hong-bao"! To non-chinese peeps, have a great holiday!    Happy Chinese New Year everyone! Gong Xi Fa Cai!  :)

We still have one final chance to prove ourselves. Are we worthy our positions? Yes? No? We will find out soon. Drastic changes to be made. Stay tuned.

In addition, Geetha and Martin are such corny jokers.. Ms Shelley Low's lessons are so interesting too. We're so blessed to have such teachers in CT. Brian embarassed me yesterday during Mr Lee's lesson. Aahh.. I knew this day would come! That nuthead, pinched him like don't know how many times after that. =P   I have been staying back til evening almost everyday to practice the Chinese New Year performance. I can't wait for the audition! Btw, I'm the Squad IC for Sec 3s. Congrats to Staff xiongster who's the NCO head! The first few weeks of school sure is hectic, I hope the next few would be a lil' more relaxed..    (: Yoshiko<>Nanoko<>Kyoko :) Lotsa' love.

          Bardot - Girls do, boys don't   Hiyas! I was just about to practice A-math when I dozed off on the table.. *Zzz.. School was happening today man.. Haha. Geetha and I went crazy in the girls toilet and we just couldn't quit rapping and dancing and singing in the toilet during recess. We changed all Singapore songs' lyrics and it turned into, "The toilet song". =\ It sounded REALLY fab anyhow!   Mdm Liujian forced me to join the Chinese New Year singing competition so Jason (hoongy) and I recruited a few people and now we've got some awesome ideas! We'll see how it goes during the practice sessions. We don't have much time left, the audition is drawing nearer.. it's on Friday! I'm really looking forward to this week. =) Not only is it Siti's, Val's, Miss Koh's and Junior PY's birthday, I want to get over all the tests. And Wednesday.. it's such an incredibly important day to me. It is the day, where by my fate would be in the hands of Mrs Abdul and finalised. My future. My dream. My hopes. There would be an NPCC meeting and I will know my position in the NCO hierachy. Man! Life is full of surprises!  Izzat and I went to the mall to get stuffs for school + Miss Koh's pressie after school today. And guess who we saw? Kym Ng and her Mamamia gang. She's so pretty that she got Izzat and I mesmorized.. By the way, the stunt she carried out yesterday was horrifying. Not many people can do that.  Toodles sweeties. Peace out. xox.

          Lillix - Tomorrow   Helloos! The CCA Open House was so fun! We recruited quite a number of sec 1s, although fewer than last year =P The Police came down with the police car.. weapons.. display, wow so zai mmkays! Then nana kept fooling around with the policemen! Naughty gal.. haha!! We sat in the car.. and plaued with their weapon.. so cool.. I think this year the NPCC really was the main attraction of the open house! Teehee. We took up part of the area in front of the Technical block, the PE store room area, and the field like last year. Now that Mrs Abdul (Siti) has taken over Mr Lau's position, I believe that CTNPCC will become  tougher... (but I like!) Mr Lau is like super "welfare".. haha. He is nice, but too nice that people take his kindness for granted! =P Mr-Nice-Guy!   So excited to find out our NCO (non-commission officer) post! Sir Bernard knows but wouldn't wanna tell us. *Grrr.. Haha. Just makes me YEARN for next week's training! But I will be going down late sia.. cos Ms Shelley Lau (sp?) wants to give us a history test. And also.. gotta leave with Nana earlier cos we have flag-selling. Boooos =X *Sniffles*  Going for renioun dinner now, tata!

I miss my friends and my teachers so much. =) I miss Miss Halizah and other teachers who wouldn't be teaching us this year. *Sniffles* Our class parent is Mrs Tan Bee Bee. Incredibly meticulous. I was nominated to be the class chairperson.. I hope I can do my stuff well and not let anyone down.. and Geetha saluted me. Wow.. so honoured :P   Would be very busy next week due to the CCA Open House. So fun!! Really exhilarated.. It better not rain on that day! Mmkays, my eyes are as dry as meatballs.

I haven't made a new years resolution since 2000 and that ended up being a disaster in some respects. So here I am again. Along with the millions of other people who are making this resolution I am going to say that mine is to eat healthy and try and just try to take the steps I need to, to accomplish my goals.  I hope year 2004 would be a better and a more productive year! Best wishes to everyone...

Anyways, the Campcraft competition at the Police Academy was damn exciting! We tried, although it wasn't good enough! Lol. We went there for the experience lah.. and I didn't regret joining it  at all . We completed our tent, flagstaff and gadget, but hahahaha, the tent looked quite.. yuck. Hehehe. 11 minutes went by like "WOOoSH!" man. My team and I were laughing away when the comp ended, while the other teams looked bery solemn. Some of em' were crying too =\ Oh yupp, I really appreciate the presence of some of our sirs! *Hugs!* Thanks for comin to support. Yamwen and Sir JH treat us to drinks oso. *Smoochies*  We went back to school for GOH training and Jess and I learnt to hold the flag pole thingy. It was quite fun, but I heard that the pole would be much much mucho heavier on the actual day. Woo! Awesome... Training ended at 2pm and for the first time Yann ming went out for lunch with us (seniors) haha.. damn lame man. 47 chromosomes. -.-"" HAHA. LOVE MY KIDS. Gonna start a "corn-knee club" soon.

          Nickelback - Someday    It's time for the  urlLink Friday Five ! :)   When was the last time you...  1. ...went to the doctor? About 3 weeks back. 2. ...went to the dentist? Oh my goose.. it's been forever. 3. ...filled your gas tank? I've never filled it. 4. ...got enough sleep? Last december holidays. 5. ...backed up your computer? Some time in Jan this year.  Jason(Weihoong) pleaded me to confront Sabrina during tuition just now, to let her know that it was just a prank. So Jeremy, Lucas and I gave in to him. After Sabrina got to know about it, Jason forgave me, which really didn't make a difference because he did not forgive Jeremy! It seemed like everything was back to normal, we became friends and all, but when tuition ended, Jason flared up and bellowed at us. I think what he yearned for was attention. I really have no idea what his thoughts are. One moment he tells me that we should pretend that we do not know each other, another moment he complains that he can't stand Jeremy and I ignoring him. I think that Valentines' Day prank is truly the funniest thing I've ever done in my entire life! No offence Jason, but KUDOS to Jerms! :) He also came in top for the Bio test. Smartie poo!

          The starting line - Best of me    I know the world is filled with troubles and many injustices. But reality is as beautiful as it is ugly. I think it is just as important to sing about beautiful mornings as it is to talk about slums. I just couldn't write anything without hope in it. --  Oscar Hammerstein   Mrs Chua deserves my utmost respect.

          Five for fighting - Superman (It's not easy)    Aww, this is such a beautiful song. By the way, if you've noticed, I changed the layout! It was inspired by my mom. She loves pink (like Trista) and so do I! :) For some reason, I can't stop recollecting the phrase "Pink Sorority Sluts". I ain't referring to my mom and I. It's just that when Nora and I hung out during Christmas last year, she mentioned about Ignatious actually labelling us as the "Sorority Sluts". Bwahaa. How can that happen? Haha! Honestly dude, we're such innocent little girls. * Clears throat * Aiight, toodles sweeties!   I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find The better part of me   I'm more than a bird I'm more than a plane More than some pretty face beside a train and It's not easy to be me   Wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie About a home I'll never see   It may sound absurd But don't be naive Even Heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed But won't you conceed Even Heroes have the right to dream but It's not easy to be me   Up, up and away Away from me It's all right You can all sleep sound tonight I'm not crazy or anything  I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive Men weren't meant to ride With clouds between their knees   I'm only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street Only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me    It's not easy to be me .

          Sum 41 - Motivation      Happy Valentines' Day!    Valentines' Day is different this year, because I have a date! My  husband  Geetha dear. * Smmmucks! * So anyways, Fiona and I attended the Chairperson/secretary workshop this morning before training, which was incredibly productive. Fiona cracked me up so badly I feel like gasing her to death some day.  Heil Hitler!   Heil!   Personally, training with the NCC boosted my morale. Sir Amir is  awesome . He's just... awesome! An incredible sir who's very teachable, motivating and diplomatic. I think it would be cool if our school had NCC - girls. I would be the first to sign up. Haha!   I love boys!  (Although I've told myself time and again that I'm ignoring guys for a year) Yet boys nowadays are so.. thoughtful! TS Faizal baked brownies for me, Jake got me a big pressie, Jason got me a soft toy, Brian purchased the  Black Eyed Peas  album and gave me a rose (part of the class V.day plan), Martin (Yulun) and Gabriel (Fengrui) got me the heart-shaped balloon and the finger puppets. And most importantly, the boys from the NCO squad (Sec 4/5) bought us roses! Thank you so much guys. You guys rock! CTNPCC rocks my socks!  Wenta' JJC's Love Fiesta with the chicks (Jess, Geets dear, Jiax, Kalyn) and dined at Marche (Orchard). The outing was totally, "HAHAHA!" My girls are such amiable and humourous people, I  really  am blessed, I truly love their company.   Anyways if Jenna hadn't gone home on yesterday's episode of  Survivor , she probably wouldn't forgive herself until the day she dies or something. Life is SO short.  8 days .. is a short time, but if spent wisely, many things can be done. I'm happy that Jenna made the right choice by pulling herself out of the game. Lotsa love.

          Good charlotte - Bloody valentine      NO IMMUNITY CHALLENGE OR TRIBAL COUNCIL        In a historic edition of SURVIVOR: ALL-STARS, the Immunity Challenge and Tribal Council were cancelled after  Mogo Mogo tribe member Jenna Morasca , the 22-year-old winner of SURVIVOR: THE AMAZON from Bridgeville, Pennsylvania, bowed out of the competition. After much deliberation, Jenna M. realized she had made a mistake by joining the All-Stars instead of being at home with her ill mother.   As the tribes convened for an Immunity Challenge, Jenna Morasca shocked the other castaways by  pulling herself out of the game . In an extremely emotional speech, Jenna explained that she had made a bad judgment by becoming an All-Star, and that she was needed at home.   Jeff Probst then announced that both the Immunity Challenge and Tribal Council would be cancelled because Jenna Morasca would be leaving the game. Jenna bade a tearful goodbye to all the castaways, then boarded the boat for the first leg of her journey home to her mother.    Eight days after Jenna returned home, her mother lost her battle with cancer.     urlLink More..

          Maroon 5 - She will be loved    There are some days when you just feel so down and begin to self-indulge in doubting yourself. There are days you feel so listless, sad, worried and guilty all at the same time. There are some days when you wish you havent said what you have said, but all these cant be undone since you have said those words. Well, yesterday was  the day  for me.  Right now I'm feeling kinda flustered and tired. Much better than yesterday though, because Martini sms-ed me (shan't disclose the details of message for privacy purpose). It made me feel relieved.   Training yesterday. Training today. Meeting the principal Mr Haaannngg for a meeting tomorrow with the NCOs * gulps *. Test tomorrow. Test on thursday. Training on friday. Tuition on friday. Heh! What a week. I can't wait for saturday. History lessons. Chairperson workshop. Training. JJC Love Fiesta. Marche with the chicks. Wooyeah.

          New found glory - Boy crazy         Good ol' Rudy.. :)  I never knew these about Rudy.   Since finishing in third place on SURVIVOR: BORNEO, Rudy Boesch and his wife of 48 years, Marge, have travelled the world making all sorts of appearances.   Rudy joined the Navy in April of 1945 and immediately volunteered for "secret and hazardous duty" with the Amphibious Scouts and Raiders, highly classified naval commando units. In 1951, six years after Scout and Raider training in Fort Pierce, Florida, Rudy completed UDT (Underwater Demolition Teams) training in Little Creek, Virginia, and was assigned to UDT-2 (redesigned as UDT-21 in 1953). He remained in UDT-21 for the next 11 years. During this period, he completed numerous specialized schools and was deployed routinely to the Mediterranean and Caribbean areas with the Naval Amphibious Forces. He became a proficient combat swimmer and expert in small-boat operations. In 1962, he was one of the 50 hand-selected officers of the original SEAL (Sea-Air-Land) Team TWO, becoming one of their most distinguished members.   In 1967, Rudy was advanced to the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer and, between combat tours, served as the senior enlisted position of Command Master Chief. From 1968-1970, Rudy completed two combat deployments to Vietnam. Among the numerous awards he won the Bronze Star Medal for heroic action during more than 45 combat operations. During and after his stint in Vietnam, Rudy was delegated the "Chief SEAL" and set physical and operational standards at SEAL Team TWO.   In the late 1980s, Rudy became the Naval Special Warfare Community "Bull Frog," a distinguishing award presented to the SEAL serving the longest time on active duty. Instead of retiring, Rudy was selected as the Senior Enlisted Advisor to USSOCOM. In August of 1988, Rudy headed to Tampa, Florida and entered into the "inner circle" of the Special Operations Command to advise on all enlisted matters of the Joint command. For his extraordinary performance, Rudy was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal, an award not often given to an enlisted man.   Master Chief Rudy retired from the U.S. Navy after completing more than 45 years of continuous activity. He was honorably discharged on August 1, 1990. He and Marge have since been involved in extensive volunteer work. In 1992, he captained a 38' power boat during the "Americas Cup 1992" event. In 1996, he captained a support boat at the Summer Olympic Games. He continues as a Red Cross Volunteer and drives support vehicles and performs essential services during disaster-relief operations. He is also a volunteer for the Virginia Beach Police Department. Involved with many organizations, Rudy is a founding member of the UDT-SEAL Association and a founding member of the Association's Board of Directors, having once served as their President. He is also on the Board of Directors of the Special Operations Fund.   Rudy and Marge have three children: Ellen Marie, Patricia Ann and Barbara Jean, and one granddaughter, Kelsey. They reside permanently in Virginia Beach, Virginia. His birth date is January 20, 1928.   Credit:  urlLink Survivor: All Stars

          Train - Drops of jupiter    I had to skip Miss Shelley Low's History lesson on the Cold War because of CCA related reasons. I feel really bad.. but ah well. Made my trip down to Police Academy (Tracom) with Jeff and made a new friend from ACS(I), Harry. Met another guy from RV who was my group member in the Adventure training camp last year. Solaris! :) Saw the Tanglin kids and Sir Faizal, Diyanah and XY from JinTai and several others.   The briefings and balloting lasted for a few hours and everyone was bored stiff. We left the place at 1pm+. Yayness! Jeff treat me to a taxi ride sia, haha, and took me to Clementi where I met Geets and Jiax. We headed to town for lunch at Yuki and Yaki or whatever it is called. Talked... and talked... and we saw Eileen! Bought our Valentines Day gifts for all our guy and gal pals before heading home. :) Woooot. I bought this really hee-uge mug with a black+pink carton-like packaging for Brian which totally kick-butt!! I hope he likes it. He told me that he had already bought me a Black eyed peas album. *Awww.. now it won't be a surprise anymore! Haha. But it's okay la. *Sighs* I don't know what to get for Jeremy and Zavier (aka weihoong -.-"). I'm getting all the girls little pressies and I don't know if I'm supposed to get Qingrui one too. I think I would have to.   It is indeed weird sitting behind now. Maybe I'll get used to it in a while.

          Slick shoes - Nows the time    BOO! My computer was down for a coupla' days and I must admit, it was effin' boring without the company of the world wide web. On the other hand, it was an advantage of not having the internet around, because the only productive thing I could do was to revise, revise and revise somemore! :) We had 3 tests yesterday, and I was absent from school because I was ill. Thanks to the  antibiotics  my doctor had prescribed me, I am recovering incredibly quickly.     Antibiotics  : Antibiotics are complex substances produced by microorganisms as a byproduct which they excrete. They are used mainly in the treatment of bacterial diseases.  Tah! Enough with biology! Nana and I sat for the test this afternoon and I was rather shocked cos' I didn't quite expect an essay question. Haha. Well, life is full of surprises! Don't you think so? I love surprises, yet I hate to be surprised. Tah! Enough with the crap already pearls... -.-"  Jeremy just called to tell me that William Hung's song is on Power 98 FM!! Oh my goose!! It's totally hilarious!! William Hung even has his personal  urlLink website , you guys should REALLY check it out. It's totally awesome.. I'm not kidding! Haha! If you don't even know who William Hung is, *clears throat*, you should get a life! Wooyeah!  No insults, peace out dudes! XOX :P

          Lillix - It's about time    I cut my hair today!! :D Along with Nanoko and Diana. Maizura tagged along cos' she wanted to learn from the hair stylists. We wenta' KIMAGE at Lot 1 and the haircut costs about.. $25.20. Mucho cheaper than Jean Yip and Jantzen. Actually my Mom doesn't allow me to spend so much on a haircut, cos I usually cut for $12. *Teehee. On the other hand... I received about $26 from Lucas, Jason and Jeremy cos we intro-ed each other for some math tuition thingy so we split the money up. Hohoho.. I trimmed and layered my hair and fringe. Nana looks the most different among the 3 of us. Tomorrow's Sports Day and I'm really excited! *Woot!* :P Oh ya.. the math test this afternoon was a disaster! My last question.. Hoho, I forgot to arc cosine, neither did Gabriel. Anyways.. gonna have dinner now. Toodles kids! :P

          Busted - Psycho girl    Wowwiee. What a day! Hurhur. Miss Low began her humanities lesson at 7 in the morning and as usual, it was filled with laughter and her interesting experiences (when she lived in a kampong in M'sia) kept me awake.   NPCC training was a bang. I looove trainings, it makes me feel so disciplined and proud (of my CCA). We did some basic drills and Sir Kiwi informed us that he and the other CIs and ICs would access us for our promo test based on today's performance. Jess (Pui Yoke) and I were the flag bearers so compared to my other mates who were carrying the rifle, we were mucho luckier. So we just practiced marching in and out again and again and again, from 8am+ to 12pm+ with all the other uniform groups. At one point, Mr Lee pretended to be the Guest of Honour and everyone cheered for him. Haha. He is an incredibly nice teacher. :)   After which, Val, Xiong, Edwyn, Yati, Jess and I wenta' Seoul Garden at JP to celebrate Edwyn's birthday. Laugh until I almost vomitted. *Teehee* :P We met Beng and his GF and we all gathered near the MRT station to chat for about an hour or less, then went home, beat. Hehe. It was a rather tiring day, cos after the other uniform groups have been dismissed, we still had to change to our full U for the continuation of the our promotion test. Good luck to everyone when the results are out! " Endure !"

          Nine days - Absolutely      "Love and Friendship"  Love is like the wild rose-briar, Friendship like the holly-tree -- The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms But which will bloom most constantly?  The wild-rose briar is sweet in the spring, Its summer blossoms scent the air; Yet wait till winter comes again And who wil call the wild-briar fair?  Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now And deck thee with the holly's sheen, That when December blights thy brow He may still leave thy garland green.

          Tiffani wood - What R U waiting 4?    Oh my goose! This is sucha' kick-butt song. Tiffani didn't let us down afterall. Some of you might've forgotten who she is. It's Tiff from  Bardot ! After the group splitted up, she pursued her solo career like what Katie and Sophie did, and they're all doin really well! I'm anticipating Belinda and Sally's comeback. So here it is,  urlLink Tiffani Wood 's debut single, "What R U waiting 4?"! I've been waiting for this moment since forever! :P        What R U Waiting 4    (Matthew Gerrard / Bridgit Benenate / Steve Brooker)     Verse 1  Sometimes I get that overwhelming feeling So sad the faces on TV If I tried to make a difference would it help anyway and then I stop and to myself I say   Chorus  So you wanna change the world What r u waiting 4? Say you're gonna start right now What r u waiting 4? It only takes one voice so come on now and shout it out Give a little more What r u waiting 4?   Verse 2  Sometimes I feel a little helpless Seems like I can't do a thing But anything is possible, just you wait and see Good things happen if you just believe   Chorus    Middle 8  Someday, Somehow Gonna take that step Cause time is ticking away Right here, right now Before it's too late Gonna face tomorrow today  What r u, what r u waiting Waiting, what r u waiting 4?

          Box car racer - The end with you    The UG camp sure was indescribable. Some people felt that it was pretty bad, yet I for one, am truly happy for my kids. I firmly believe that they have displayed a great deal of outstanding leadership qualities, which I don't see during the weekly trainings. It can still be further improved though :)  Anyways, so friday was the UG camp. We had our CEP 2 after school so Nana, Geets dear and I went back home after that. I had to catch a cab for tuition after I had taken my bath because I was running late. I arrived early at the tuition centre -.-" Wenta' school at 9pm and watched the Talent time, followed through the night walk as an  observer  (my duty lor). Group leaders Christine and Jonathan were pretty good. At night.. mwahaha.. Weihao played the guitar while I sang to the tunes of "My immortal" by Evanescence, "Yellow" by Coldplay, "Breathe" by Michelle Branch, "Time of your life" by Green day, and so on.. there were so many kick-ass songs which he strummed! * Goes ga-ga over the melodious sounds of the acoustic guitar * I wish I could play as well as he could. Weihao is a super pro! In return of his out-going-ness (hehe), I also strummed a coupla tunes, such as "Swing swing" by the All American Rejects, "Paper heart" by AAR also.. Michelle's "Everywhere" and Avril's "I'm with you". I wasn't very good at it, but Weihao still said some nice things. I still remembered how I started out playing the guitar on my own after getting inspired by Sir Kevin from Tanglin NPCC. ATC days... :)  The UG leaders slept at around 3am plus.. and awoke at 5am+. I wenta' meet Nana, Mrs Chua and all for the PP slides competition at Temasek poly. So fun!! Mrs Chua.. MY IDOL! ;) After the whole thing, we wenta' Tampines mall for lunch and offered to treat us, but we declined her offer politely. Hehehe. Amesie, Nana and I + Mrs Chua then took a cab back to school, and I wenta' help out for the UG camp again. It was rather messy then.. but ah well!   Now that I'm back home.. I seriously need to catch up on my sleep. Toodles sweethearts!

          Sublime - Wrong way    Wow.. 2/25 for my history test. Woo! What a terrifico start for the week. First time marked by Miss Shelley Low. I have been yearning to realise how incredibly strict Miss Low can be when it comes to marking our tests. She did a great job in failing me man. Haha. I'll never forget this 2/25. My lowest in my entire life! Woo!    Stupid gong gong , who am I kidding, of course I feel disappointed,  bloody hell , but failing is part and parcel of life. You're a loser until you pick yourself up and continue to persevere in the battle. On a brighter note.. 2/25 wasn't the lowest, and if I'm not mistaken, nobody passed the test.   I'm so looking forward to the weekend, an emphasis on the "so". The UG camp is on friday, and if nothing goes wrong, my kids' NCO camp would be during the early holidays. Yipee! I have a fetish for camps; the stayovers, munching and gossiping, creepy sentry duties. I love doing stuff like this, just relaxing and staying peaceful, outdoors.   Alrighty.. Nono is leaving soon, in a few days to be exact. As much as Nana is gonna miss him, I will, too. Nana showed me the pictures we took the other day, many of em' couldn't be developed because there wasn't any flash.  On the other hand, the other photos turned out really fab :) I wish we could hang out somemore though...

Nono would be returning to his homeland in a week or 2 if I'm not mistaken, so Nana and I had lunch with him and took spastic photographs from 3pm-6pm++. He's sucha nice and cool dude.. treat me to lunch twice in a week! Haha. You can never find a kinder person like him, although he can be incredibly corrupted with his nonsensical, dirty jokes!

          Jet - Are you gonne be my girl    Just came across a Buddha quote, which I find very true.  "Words have the power to both destroy and heal. When words are both true and kind, they can change our world."  Words, the even slight misunderstanding or the misinterpretation of them can make someone either happy or sad, can throw our mood in exuberant joy or in incredible despair.  Anyways, I'm in a rather good mood now, chatting with my lover Fiona (Oops sorry Geets!), Taufiq and Zu, currently typing out a proposal for something exciting for my sec 3 kids. *Smoochies*Everyone seems so stressed lately, even I myself feel the pressure already. I think it's awesome that the holidays are drawing nearer. Although we would still be attending lessons everyday, it would be less exhausting. I strongly believe that it is an incredibly deserving short break for all those who have been mugging productively during the past 2 months.   Til next time, keep loving. =)

          Blink 182 - I miss you         This is my favourite photo of yesterday evening's Speech Day! The most inspiring, youthful, incredibly beautiful, amusing, intelligent, caring, motherly and helpful teacher ever..  Mrs T. Chua . You go girl!  Sir Faizal recorded our march past on a video cam yesterday and I'm waiting for Senior Xiongster to come online to send it to me. * Yawns * :P Today's training was pretty much different cos like, we had games and cheers this time round. I miss training for Speech Day already. Can somebody please wake me up? * Hears Sadhiq, ' Wake up lah !' * It ended quite emotionally for me, because I felt worried.   To my kids, I love you all, and I hope you guys strive hard and stick together no matter what, while taking over the unit when we are not around. You guys  have  the potential, just work hard and don't complain about little issues (I know some of you are fond of doing that, haha). I'll leave you all with a quote by Robert K. Greenleaf.  "The only test of leadership is that somebody follows."  All the best!

          Lillix - What I like about you      "Nothing splendid has ever been achieved except by those who dared believe that something inside them was superior to circumstance."   -- Bruce Barton   Oh my goose! I'm ecstatic!!! HAHAHA. I have never felt so blessed. The heavy rain finally stopped and we made in just in time for the Guest of Honour to arrive, so we all got to march!! Yeehaw! Everything went smoothly, except that the NCC kinda screwed up (according to Weeqi) at the last part of the march past. As for the NPCC, I believe that this was the best march past so far, and I'm incredibly proud of my squadmates and juniors who were in the GOH. The supporting contingents were good too, so KUDOS to ya all! Each and everyone of you kicked butt! :D  After marching, Sadhiq, Junior Pui Yoke and I proceeded to the hall to receive our prizes. Remember the 'Good news' which I had mentioned 1 or 2 weeks back and didn't want to type it out in my blog? Well, it was actually Sadhiq and I receiving the Best NPCC Unit Cadet award. It came as a surprise to us, haha. Oh yupp, I took a lot of  urlLink photos ! Go check them out if you wanna :) Man.. I'm really happy today.. I think today is one of the happiest days of my life.   Have a good night's rest my dear friends. Toodles!

Today has been wonderful. Actually, the past coupla' days have been great. Oh yupp, think I forgot to update, I'm sandwiched between Gabriel (Fengrui) and Jeremy in the current seating plan and it's been rather fun sitting next to them. Martini sits two seats away from me, and  still  constantly teases me. He and Gabriel are always laughing at my  noob ness. Dang! This week has been a rather hectic week as well, because we have been having tests, tests and more tests! Good, at least it ensures that I revise my work. Okie dokie, time for dinner. Ciao lovers!

          Smash mouth - Walkin on the sun         Senior Yati thinks that I am too serious during the Parade! Haha. I promise to look less stern this coming monday aiight sweetie? My parents think I look good in the photograph though, fierce-looking and all. Hohoho. There are more photos from Yati's blog and I think Val and Xiongster still has somemore in their Digital cameras. I'll wait for them to send me some of the photos before uploading them. Speech Day is in less than a week's time and I'm totally exhilarated! Everyone went hysterical when they put on their No.1 Us during the previous training because it feels different when you have it on. It boosts the morale of the contingent and the best thing about it is that, it is an  honour , to be able to put it on.  Anyways, I haven't began studying for my Chinese mid-yrs which is in about 3 weeks time! Gosh am I dead or what. Mdm Liu Jian expects me to get an A1 when I targetted for an A2. I feel that it would already be rather difficult to score an A2 because my chinese composition writing is not strong enough. On the other hand, nothing is impossible. Results only come after hard hard work. Endure guys! :) *Cheers!

          Nelly furtado - Try      Happy 18th Birthday Yati!! :)   I think the school forum is a great way of expressing our views, however, Miss Low forbids us from posting too many stuff cos she expects us to concentrate on our studies. Honestly speaking, the forum is rather addictive, I love to hear the voices of people from all over.   Just a random thought, I feel really blessed to be borned with such loving parents and siblings. I remember how I used to dislike my eldest sister, Mika, because in my eyes, it seemed as though she enjoyed only nagging and scolding me for every little mistake I used to make. When I was at my lowest (in Secondary 2), she reprimanded the s*** out of me to wake me up from my 'dreams' so as to face reality. It was a rather dramatic period for the both of us because I was so mad at her I swear I wanted to stab her with a knife each time I saw her. We hurled vulgarities at one another and she made nasty remarks which made me break down every now and then. However, after several weeks, I stepped out of that dark little corner of my bedroom and turned over a new leaf. I am using the phrase "turn over a new leaf" because I was once, what you'd never expect out of Pearlyn. I have to thank my sister for being so mean to me then. And I am truly sorry for being such an awful younger sister during that period. We're now on very good terms and I love her to pieces! Now whenever she nags at me, I feel so lucky because not everyone has older siblings to be nagged at. I anticipate the weekends these days cos she would return home from the hostel for dinner with her boyfriend. Well... So much about the side of Pearlyn not many people know :)   Congratulations to all CTNPCC cadets who have received their new ranks and badges! For those who were unable to achieve what they've been working for, good luck for your period of probation. Nothing is impossible if you work hard for it. I'll leave you guys with a quote by Richard Bach - " Every problem has a gift for you in its hands. "  Good night folks :)

          Lillix - What i like about you    Hey guys! I went to Sentosa today with Gabriel (Fengrui), Jessica and Richie. Haha. Thank god I applied heaps of sunblock lotion, cos' the UV rays from the sun was piercing into moi skin cells. Oops. I'm all red and hot now. Hehe. My lil' sister and mom have gone to the mall to buy some chocolate ice cream. Yummers! Anyways, I was really disgusted by the sea weed but Gabriel kept throwing them at me! *Yuck!* Jess treated us to ice cream cos she was the last in reaching for the metal pole. Heehee:P The life guard caught Gabriel and Richie twice, hehe. Once for not putting on their life jackets and another time because they were fooling around with the tyre-like floats in the waters. Haha! Crazy dudes. We also saw the 4B1-ians from CTSS last year! What a pleasant surprise! Mr Simon Liao(sp?) was there as well. We washed up and headed to town for lunch at Yoshinoya. We met some CTSS peeps who were very bored, to the extent of actually standing at The Heeren, counting how many people they know from CTSS. Haha! They could've at least brought along their Chinese shou-ce! *Teehee. Ooh, which reminds me, our Chinese mid year exam is 29 days away.  Okie dokie, gonna polish boots and get ready my uniform for tomorrow's training. Keep loving friends, and Happy Good Friday! Lotsa love! :)

          Avril lavigne - Don't tell me    One day, I'm going to be like them...       I think there are many girls out there who would also  love  to perform in a pop/rock band, and I'm one of them :D Each time I listen to the radio or CD, I fantasize about myself performing on stage in a really cool rock band with hundreds or thousands of fans (which include my family members and friends) cheering and singing along with me!  Am I dreaming? Haha.. Hopefully, someday, I will be able to fulfil this 'dream' of mine.

          Simple plan - I'd do anything            Hohoho. I brought my cam to school today to take a coupla' random shots with my friends. The first photo features Yu Lun, aka  Martini ! My partner in class. Looking hot huh? ;) 2nd pic: Dasen, Fengrui, Jonathan, Weihao and I acting  dao  (did we succeed?), except for the Head Prefect Jonathan lookin all smiley smiley. Congrats by the way! Jon, your speech was awesome!   Oh yups! Mr Lee brought Fiona, Martini, Geets dear and I to Mac' for lunch today cos it was raining cats and dogs at around 3.30pm and we haven't had our lunch. Hehe! How incredibly sweet of him to drive us there!   I received a very good piece of news today! But.. I don't think I'll reveal it here yet. Hahaha. Just feel happy for me ok? Hohoho. Anyways, to those who are going for tomorrow's Speech Day rehearsal, please do hydrate yourselves! Chill it dudes!

          D12 - My band        Happy April Fools' Day!           Yeehaw! Hehehe. Today is our school's annual Sports Meet and although we were supposed to be given the morning off to celebrate our school's outstanding O level results, we were made to go to school for Humanities and Physics lessons. I think the teachers sacrficed a lot of time to prepare their lessons, so thank you, Mrs Tan and Miss Low! * Huggles! * So this morning at 8am, Fiona came up with a brilliant idea, to fool Miss Shelley Low cos it's April fools day! Hehe.. Oh my gosh, it was hilarious! We all hid in the  Band  Choir store room while Fiona told Miss Low that nobody was present because someone posted a message at AsknLearn informing us about the cancellation of Miss Low's lesson. Miss Low's reaction was so incredibly funny, I think she got a lil' mad at first, and went hysterical later! She almost wacked Fiona with her TV antennae!! Hohoho! Everyone broke into peals of laughter after that. Thanks to Fiona for starting my day with so much giggles!   Mrs Tan Bee Bee is really nice today as well. She let us off at 11.15am instead of 12noon, so we all headed for lunch at KFC before going to the stadium. Bought heaps of snacks and we had a little picnic, eating chocolate ice cream which Geets had bought! * YUMMY * What a sin though! Haha! Most of our teachers came over to sit with us at the stadium. *Teehee. Mr Lee looked so adorable in the class tee, it was silly of him to wear it over his polo shirt though. Haha! We settled the extra class tees thingy (finally) and took some photos, which can be found at Siti's blog. I like the class photos, it's so cute with our teachers in them! Man.. it sure was exhilarating! The 4X100m race was postponed (according to Amelia) due to the weather, which I thought was a waste because I had a feeling that we might be able to win today. Hehe. I'm happy, I'm also exhausted! Thanks to everyone who made this such an unforgetable event. I think Fiona is the happiest today though! Haha! Because she got to talk and play with Miss Low! Hehehe. Fiona's such a silly nutto. I love her to bits!   Martini is a pain in the ass. Haha! Just kidding. He sent me the same testimonial 7 times. And he sent me an April Fools Day joke via sms. So not funny! Make me panic only. -.-" Hafiz intro-ed a song to me by D12. Quite nice, it sounds so cute man. Hoho. Nana, if you're reading this, cheer up and kick some ass! To the class committee members, you guys rock me and my peanut butter! Siti, thanks for posting up the pics! :D  [4B1'04!] Rocks!   I'm going to end with a quote by Doc Childre,  "The more care you put into your life, the more life will care for you, bringing you fun adventures, great friends, and real inner security. Caring is just good streetsense — So, Judge less and unstress, Care more and high score."   Toodles and rock on kids!

          Bowling For Soup - Punk Rock 101     Oh Mee Goose It's Over!!! :D    * Does the Happy dance *     I think the paper was average, except that I could only answer 3/5  Han Zi  correctly. I had different answers for the Compre multiple-choice section when I compared my question paper with Karen, Jeremy and Amelia. As for Paper 1, Mdm Liu Jian kind of spotted the  Gong-Han  question for us already, so many thanks to  lao-shi ! Then, I attempted Question 4 on Whether we thought Singapore was an Ideal Homeland. Anyways, I would also like to thank my Chinese tuition  lao-shi ! I love you lao-shi! :) Thank you so much for sacrificing your time for us. Lao-shi taught me not to give up and put in my best in whatever I did, and most importantly,  pray . So KUDOS to  lao-shi ! Most importanly, I would like to thank my family members who have been constantly praying for me. :) Mommy thanks for the essence of chicken, hee hee, and Daddy, thanks for all the car-rides! You guys rock me and my peanut butter! In addition, many thanks to: Mrs Chua, Mrs Raja, Fiona, Nanoko, Amily (with all her blesses), Jiax, Karen, YongJie, Kalyn, Hamann, LayChoo, Narin, Brian, Sheena and all the people who wished me luck via. phone, etc. (I'm sorry if I left anyone out!)     Anyways, Jeremy, Simon, Fiona, Geets, Jiax and I went to see  The Day After Tomorrow  which was incredible. A mixture of Sci, Romance, Humour, Family. The type of movie you would never regret watching. Amazing! :) After that I got home and because I was bored and didn't want to touch my books, I went walk-a-jog! ALONE. :( * Sniffle * Haa haa. Because Kalyn dear went on a shopping spree in town. But anyhow I saw Ma'am Vivian! I should jio her to go jogging next time since we live in the same block. Hee hee :) Anyone who lives around Bt Batok, let me know if you would like to work out. Because I would be moving back to Bt Timah soon.. Yupp, so I would like to spend more time to get to know Bt Batok. I've been living here for about 4 years already, but I still have no idea where Avenue 3, etc. is. What a dork.    Well, I'm really glad that it's all over. I love you all! * Huggles! *

Actually I felt that it was, but I put NO as my answer cos I would've had more to talk about. (Eg. Stress at a young age, etc.) But I think I went a bit out of point. Haa haa ;) Anyways, I would also like to thank my Chinese tuition  lao-shi ! I love you lao-shi! :) Thank you so much for sacrificing your time for us. Lao-shi taught me not to give up and put in my best in whatever I did, and most importantly,  pray . I know the kids and I took up a lot of your precious time (I spent 8 hours at her house yesterday) for the past 2 weeks. You could've made us come once a week only but you ensured that we attended lessons everyday! So KUDOS to  lao-shi ! Most importanly, I would like to thank my family members who have been constantly praying for me. :) Mrs Chua, Fiona, Nanoko, Amily (with all her blesses), Jiax, Karen, YongJie, Kalyn, Hamann, LayChoo, Narin, Brian, Sheena and all the people who wished me luck via. phone, etc. (I'm sorry if I left anyone out!)

Are there any rich, kind souls out there who would like to fulfil my wish - to purchase  urlLink this  kewlies Avril tee-shirt for me? * Dreams dreamily * I would be the happiest woman in the World if I had it on.     * Does the happy dance *     I sound like an idiot.

          Fefe Dobson - Everything     I love chronicles.                     The first photo depicts myself studying for Physics rather seriously, then subsequently I lose control and my brain breaks down and * snoorrees... * ;)    Alamak , so many random thoughts. If everyone chips in 2 dollars each for Jeremy's birthday present, he would be able to go to Linkin Park's gig. He hinted to me yesterday. I need more time. If I were to go to the Band Concert on Tuesday, I would have to make up for the hours lost to study Chinese! I feel as though I have lost a lot of blood. I have Chinese tuition on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday next week.  Monday is  the day . After  the day , I will watch movies!     GIANT MOSQUITOES!!! TOODLES KIDDOS! * Smucks *

          Avril Lavigne - Take Me Away       All the pain I thought I knew All my thoughts lead back to you  Back to what was never said Back and forth inside my head I can't handle this confusion I'm unable; come and take me away      This is a new song entitled "Take Me Away" from Avril Lavigne's new album,  Under My Skin . Rahil reminded me about our exchange of presents today and I suddenly felt somewhat excited. I was actually dreading to go to school next week due to the intensive mother tongue lessons. Yet now, I am looking forward to next week! And the week after next, until I receive Avril's album from her. *Hee Haa! It's silly, we're both purchasing Avril's album and wrapping it up before exhanging gifts. It makes me happy when I see the smile on the faces of people whom I care for.    We had our Passing Out Parade (POP) today. Took photos, with my kids, with the NCOs. Gosh, I will miss taking my Sec 3s. All the best to my kids in maintaining the unit! It's all up to you guys now! Love you all lots. *Hugs* Don't let Sadhiq and I down alright? :)    Be gone with the wind..  Wooosh!  *Tee hee!* I am going to sleep now so that I can have enough energy to last me through the night.

          Hoobastank - The Reason     This is such a beautiful song.         I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you   I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]   I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you   I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you      I realised that my blog has somewhat become a music review site. Well, it's cool anyways. I love music ;)   I have been constantly thinking about my future. Contemplating about how my life in the near future would be like. Would I be in JC? Would I be in Poly? I would undeniably yearn to go to a JC. On the other hand, what are the chances of securing a stable job compared to a Poly student who has a diploma and more hands-on experience? These are a few questions that have been 'bobbing' up and down in my mind. Somewhat like... a 'sea' of confusion. And at times, the thinking accelerates like a  carousel.  To the extent of, hurting.     Ouch!  Haha. What am I talking about? Anyways, tomorrow is my last parade. I feel kind of, in between. Reluctant to attend training, yet excited to hand over the unit to my Sec 3 kids.      Off visiting Germany!  In my history textbook.

Dumm dee dum...       Things to do after MT 'O's : x Watch Harry Potter x Watch The Day After Tomorrow x Watch Shrek 2 x Kayaking 2 Star course x Shopping spree x Girls night out at Jiax's + Chocolate Mousse cake baking!!      There is this song by Meredith Brooks entitled " Bitch " and part of the chorus goes a little something like this:  I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother, I'm a sinner, I'm a saint  So I asked Jeremy to pick one of those words which best describes me, and he picked,  mother .

I really appreciate what you've done sweetie. Fiona has also succeeded in hugging LNK. I could hear her heart thumping then. :D   Anyways, Kalyn, Ruth and I went for a jog at Bt Batok Nature Park this morning and we had such an awesome time sharing all our girly secrets. * Hush! * :P Exercising really does help to relieve stress and shed calories. Better if you're with your friends, because when you yak, you have no idea that you've actually ran 3.2km, and it seemed quite effortless, unlike those never-ending TAF runs. Haha! On a brighter note, Her Excellency,  Chiobu Chua  has been recruited into our  Calorie losing  and gaining them back later  gang . * Teehee * Thanks for the wonderful time spent at the park and in the library my dear girls - Ruth and Kalyn!    By the way, Ruth wrote me a beautiful quote from Shakespeare behind my foolscap paper. It's so  chim  I didn't understand, except for the phrase,  O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?     Thanks Geetha, Jess and Karen for the postcard! Siti Rahil, I am surprised about how you feel about me, thank you very much for the testimonial. It made my day. I love you all!

It's one of those  Laugh-my-lungs-out  day. Yipeedeedooo.. I managed to stick with my timetable today, except that I took more than 30 minutes for my bath and spent an hour taking a nap on my study table. So now I have to make up for that. I am expecting Jeremy to comment on my bath-hours.    Mrs Chua had better not do that to us anymore.  "You want to looove us, you want to huuug us, you want to kissss us.."  You know we love you!   Fiona helped me to fulfil 1/2 of my wish. So I shall repay her kindness and do what I ought to do. ;) Then we shall proceed to Plan B, to fulfil the other part of our wish. This is getting exhilarating.        Her Caress,  So Warm. So motherly. So.. Her.

Each time I go to the Post Office it's closed. * Sigh * Her songs are so incredibly inspiring, it just gets me going, to study. Hee.   Anyways, I've never experienced a weather  THIS   HOT . Never did I stop pespiring once today, except when we were in the IT Lab and Tutorial room. I sure hope it rains later :) My air-conditioner seems as though it's about to break down. The weather also killed the runners today for the 2.4KM run.    SURVIVOR at 7.30pm. FINALE.  Rupert  MUST WIN.

          Oasis - Stop Crying Your Heart Out     The  Love  that never was...  TIme to get a little mushy and a lot sappy...  Why do fools, I mean people, fall in love? Maybe it's just something that happens, and we can't do a thing about it. Yet one thing I do know is that people are  AFRAID  of falling...  I can give you a million good reasons why many are afraid:  Heartbreaks , at both ends (to receive and to give),  commitment  and everything else...   The truth is, one should never be afraid of falling, especially if it is pure and true.   Falling means we have achieved something "High".  You coudn't fall on the ground from the ground...    When we fall, we are not sure of a "safety net" to catch us. Most of the time, many are sure to have no safety nets. The only possibility of us, being saved from the bone crushing, heart stopping, mind numbing impact is for someone, specifically, the one we would fall in love with, would catch us. On the other hand, take note that they may, but are  not obliged to , catch.  Well, still on the topic, but swerving a little, urequited love. Maybe one of the greatest forms of love. It is the love that does  EVERYTHING for NOTHING , and keeps on doing it. This is the type where, oftentimes, the giver is left wasted, lying all alone...   Oh well.. Moving on...    I stole this from Eileen :P    10 important things inside your backpack/purse:   x Wallet x Mobile phone x Tissue wipes x Discman x Chap stick x Books x Inhaler x Handbook/school diary x Pencil case x House keys    9 things that you really want right now:   x Establish good relations with my sisters x Facial because I have a pimple breakout x New mobile phone x Sling bag x My maid's arm to recover x Clear my block nose x Ice milo x Tom Yam noodles x Mrs Chua to hug meee!!! Hehehe!    8 of your favourite foods:  x Sushi x Hot dogs x Tom Yam noodles/soup x Watermelons x CHOCOLATES!!! x Potato salad x Curry x Fish balls     7 of your closer friends (not in order):  x Fiona x Nanoko x Jiax x Gabriel  x Jeremy x Valerene x Martini    6 of your favourite movies:  x 50 first dates x Titanic x Miss Congeniality x Pirates of the Carribean x Bring it on x Beauty and the Beast    5 things in your room:  x A comfy nest ;p x Study table x Radee-oh! x Wardrobe x Book shelves!    4 things you ate/drank today:  x Orange juice x Popcorn x Hot dogs x Veggie    3 things you couldn't live without:  x A bath x Water x Air    2 things you usually read:  x Books on philosophy x School books    1 person you can't forget:  x Mrs Chua! :D

          Turtle - So Happy Together     We had our Mother Tongue mid-year examinations today and I thought that it was a rather tough paper. The " Xu(1) Ci(2) " was difficult, I only knew how to do 1 out of the 5 questions. As for " Han(4) Zi(4) ", I knew how to write all 5, hopefully none are wrong.  In my opinion, the " Zao(4) Ju(4) " was the toughest among them all. For paper 1, I wrote questions 2 and 5. I actually wanted to attempt question 3, because we have already done it during Chinese lessons. However, after contemplating for a while, I decided not to, because my Chinese vocabulary isn't that fantastic. Haha. I wonder how the rest thought about this exam besides those whom I have spoken to?     Anyhow! Jiax, Martini, Simon, Jeremy, Zuhyar, Izzat and I headed for the mall to catch  Van Helsing ! It was marvellous! It reminded me of  Lord of The Rings  though, the setting, the music. Haha. Don't worry though, the content is entire different. It's sucha cool movie! DRACULAS! Yeehaw! The main characters are all so good looking! * Aww.. *     There's something wrong with my computer. Yesterday, my lil' sister pushed in the keyboard and the entire screen just rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise. We called the Compaq company but there was no answer. I'm glad that it is a flat-screened comp. I turned the entire screen so now the computer is actually on its side. Heehee.    Things will never be the same again.

Dum-dee-dum!     Jonney , you sure are bored aren't you? * Waves * :D No more lame jokes from you though, I noticed. :( I think Jonney is stressed due to the approaching Chinese pre-lims. Anyhow, I must persevere. I think it would be wasted if I didn't get an A. I'm on one of my favourite chapters now,  dan yuan 2.6  of the Sec 4 shou ce. Haha. I seldom stay up til' past midnight. I'm a hardcore morning person, very unlike people like Jessica, Amily, Jeremy, Yongjie, Geetha and Nana, who can stay up til 2/3am. How do they do it? Friggin' awesome.   **  Wen(1) Gu(4) Zhi(1) Xin(1) :  Gain new insights through examining old material.    Alrighty, I'm gonna hit tha' books. Or maybe I should just head for my enticing bed.

          Adam Sandler - Forgetful Lucy      La-woo-kee-low is the place  Where I first saw your face We liked each other right away But you didn't remember me the very next day Forgetful Lucy  Has got a nice caboose-ie I used to trick you into pulling your car over so we could chat But my favorite time was when you beat the shit out of Ula with a bat Then we drove up to see Dr. Keets  And find out why Doug always has to change his sheets Forgetful Lucy  Cracked her head like Gary Busey But I still love her so And I'll never let her go Even if while I'm singing this song She's wishing I had Jocko The Walrus shlong Forgetful Lucy Her lips are so damn juicy How about another first kiss?     This is a song from  50 First Dates  - It's one of the most hilarious and at the same time, romantic songs I've heard in quite a while. If only my future sweetheart could compose something like that... * Dreams dreamily *  Impressive.     Her Excellency  resembled a  Morbid Queen  today. Sexiness. I hope she returns to school in time for our lessons. Good luck for the blood test. BABIES :) Anyhow, I'm gonna hit the books right now.     An accelerating carousel, my mind.

          Lillix - Quicksand     Finally, a new layout. I ripped this from Pixel scripts, it's quite sweet isn't it? :) I didn't have time to make a new one, otherwise I would have. Anyways, I'm going for dinner with my family to celebrate my sister, Cherryn's 17th birthday. I wish time could stand still. I would so love to remain 16.

          American Hi-Fi- Safer on the outside    Today I woke up at 15 minutes before 6, (sharp). Without my alarm clock. This is strange because I normally don't do that...   Anyways, Good Morning World! Guess what? I had 4 large slices of Pizza last night for dinner and a slice of coffee creamed cake for desert. YUMMERS. Well actually it was my maid, Auntie Helen's birthday so she ordered Canadian pizza for my sisters and I. * Teehee * :D Talking about it now makes me really hungry.   Fiona, Jerms, Simon, Jess, Jiax and I went to  Sumo-Ya  for lunch yesterday. It's a Jap restaurant at Clementi-Empress, uber affordable and it serves delicious food! I'm not kidding! Set meals from $2.90 and it's incredibly filling, for me that it. I had Katsudon the other day and yesterday I tried something new, Curry Udon! YUMMY. Heh, it was awesome. Then we spent our time chilling there for a while before heading back to school to do Math on our own. I sms-ed Mrs Cutie T. Chua, her excellency, if she wanted lunch, and she said that Uncle Lee (Mr Lee) and her played truant, and have already gone  home sweet home . Haha! She's totally adorable... I kept all her SMS-es.. * OOoooh! * //Faints//. We went back to school and realised that Uncle Lee was still in the HOD office, in fact, he stayed back til' 5.30pm! Haha. I guess Mrs Chua received wrong info. Oops. Lol. She's still amusing anyways. Jerms and I went for tuition with Xavier (Hoong) and Lucas from 6pm-8pm. Wow, long long day!   I'm still alive. I love days like these! School, chilling out with mates, more work in school, and even more productive learning! At least I won't stone at home. I'm very prone to doing that. Ahhh ok, you know to much. Gotta go for breakfast with my family! Swimming.... and after that I'm meeting up with Martini and Jess for a movie. Keep it goin guys! * Smoooch! *

          Bardot - Love Will Find A Way    I love first days! It's always full of surprises, likewise for today. We're going to have mass runs from now on (yipee!) and 1 period of lesson would be equivalent to an hour. Morning assemblies are on every fridays and every morning, 20 minutes is reserved for TPI(Teacher-pupil interaction) Timetable changes every 10 days (2 weeks). That part, I'm still not quite used to it, but I will soon.   When I was younger, just like Lynette, I didn't like changes. But you know,  "everthing's changing, when I turn around, all out of my control, I'm a mobile"  (extracted from Avril's "Mobile"). My parents are always telling me that it is essential to adapt to our surroundings. It's like what Mr Lau would always tell us, "Survival of the fittest". So yupp, it's just a matter of getting used to it. I think mass runs would be really fun. You see, the school is so tiny, and there are 10 classes in Sec 4. I think we might just end up brisk walking due to the crampness. Teehee.   Our new class parent is Mdm Liu Jian, co-class parent is Mrs Raja. Quite alright, Ruth and I kinda miss Mrs Tan. But I think Mdm Liu and Mrs Raja will be quite 'on'. They are really supportive.  That's all for today! Take care folks!

She's pretty and so talented..  Gasps * :D By the way, today's LIFESTYLE papers rated  The Apprentice  4 out of 5 stars! I hope I'll have time to watch the next coupla' episodes though, because the term 3 exams begin next week.   I just got back from Daddy's club and the weather was really good so I went for a swim. Before that my relatives and I had a prayer session for my Grandfather cos it's his 1st death anniversary. * Sniffle * Then we headed to Aunty Mary's place (Yes that Aunty who gave me that TYR swimsuit for free *smmucks*) for buffet lunch.

          Box Car Racer - Watch The World    My sister, Mika, says it isn't Insomnia because she says if it was, it would have happened over a period of time, take for example, 1 year, not just 1 week. So, * heaves a sigh of relieve * Otherwise it would be a sign of anxiety, stress, depression, etc. (when I'm suffering from neither)  Well, Portugal won. I'm kinda in between because I don't support England nor Portugal. But I think Portugal has heaps of cuties. Besides, they've engaged a great coach. England has great players too, I don't know what happened.   I actually made an Avril layout, but I didn't feel like using it. So if there's anyone who wants it, just let me know and I'll send it over to you. :) New layout, new term. It's just  the day after tomorrow !   I came across  urlLink this  site, with guitars. They all look really beautiful.  Christmas is coming...  And I wish I had  urlLink THIS ! :) Isn't it pretty? Hee hee.

          Hanson - MmmBop    This song was sung by the  urlLink Hanson  donkey years ago, back in 97'. They've grown older now (more mature music yipee) but ahhh they're still looking cute! They play the guitar - acoustic, bass, you name it they play it. The piano, the drums, etc. Like WOW! Hahaha. ;) I totally adore them. Of course there's  urlLink Avril Lavigne  who plays the acoustic SO well on MTV,  urlLink Michelle Branch ,  urlLink Liz Phair  and  urlLink Lillix . GIRL POWER! Hahaha. They are all such great performers! * Dreams dreamily * I wish I could sing and play the guitar like them. Hee hee..  My sisters, Mika and Cherryn's boyfriends are coming over later to watch the Euro 2004 Match. That's a terrific idea because the past coupla' nights have been YUCK, really cannot fall asleep, what to do?

          Snow Patrol - Spitting Games     urlLink Snow Patrol  is SO good! An emphasis on the so. I like this song A LOT! There are so many kick-butt bands that I like at the mo - The Starting Line, Dashboard Confessionals, Snow Patrol, etc.   I am so bored right now.. watching  The Apprentice  and talking to Jason on the phone at the same time. Dumm dee dumm. I didn't do anything today. * Sigh * I told my Mum and she was like, "It's ok lah it's good to take a break", Haha. Then I went on telling her what I did today, you know the usual woke up, eat, use comp, watch tv, sleep, etc. So so sinful.. I think I will hit the gym and go for a swim on Saturday. I realised that it's actually quite fun hanging out alone! Like think about stuffs and get to know yourself better.. Reflect. I also like grocery shopping. Haha. It's pretty cool actually like ask Mummy for some money, let's say 20 dollars, then you go to the supermarket and grab some chocolates, snack bars, yoghurt, cereal, ice cream, fruits.. YUMMERS! :P  Okay lah, going to watch telly now. Cheerios! :)

          All American Rejects - Why Worry    Kalyn and I went jogging this morning then she came over to my place to study. You know what happens when 2 girls get together, it simply becomes a girly day out. Hahaha. ;) Well, we did study but we also masked our faces, ate yoghurt and digestive biscuits for lunch, surfed friendster (kalyn has an account!), listened to music, watched telly. It was fun having you around sweetie! The last time she came was last year, with Amesie Poo and Jess (with a sunflower) to visit me when I was ill. I love Jess I love Kalyn I love Amesie!!  The holidays are coming to an end soon. * Sigh * Like so soon.. By the way, are there any cures for Insomnia because I think I am suffering from it. I could not get to sleep last night. So I just tossed and turned in bed from 12 to 6. Jeremy told me to count 'Jeremy' but I think I should just stick to counting 'Sheeps' haha..   Yipee World Idol tonight! Someone told me that the Hobbit won. He's awesome!     Happy 16th Birthday Jeremy!!!   Thanks for being sucha' great brotha' man. It has been really fun sitting with you, hanging out and all. I hope we'll stay friends always! Take care and cows rule!

          Bardot - Poison    When I listen to this song it reminds me of the past - how  ga-ga  I would go over   Bardot . I could still remember distinctly, how devastated I was though, when I realised that they had splitted up. It honestly came as a shock to me.   "There will always be sunshine after a rainy day"  -- Quoted by Mr Lee, and true enough, Katie Underwood's debut single was on sale after some time, likewise for Sophie Monk, and now, Tiffany Wood (Now known as Tiffani Wood). I have yet to hear from Sally Polihronas and Belinda Chapple though.   Going crazy over Bardot brought back so many memories. I made so many friends, especially  Nora, Juliana and Lyanna . Then there was this time whereby I pon-ed school to meet Bardot at the airport, spent heaps of $$ on pressies for them (Juniors please do not follow me) and got punished and grounded by my Dad. On the other hand, I believe that during this period (Year 2001) it has been rather fufilling, mainly because I have made heaps of friends and also because I have been very thankful, not taking anything for granted.  I am actually waiting for the clock to strike 12 before I can sms  Jeremy  (as requested by him) to wish him a  Happy 16th Birthday!  Hahaha. ;) I also received news from  Daniel Faizal  that he would be leaving for NS tomorrow. Good luck and wishing you all the best!   My Dad is in the middle of the climb now, I wonder how is it like living on a Mountain? My family and I just prayed for my uncle and him. They will return on Thursday, I can't wait to listen to their adventure!   Til' then, goodnight, don't let the bedbugs bite.   I've got news for you, just remember I can be  poison . I can be poooi-sonnn....

          Blink 182 - I Miss You     Dumm dee dum. I'm beat. I went for a swim this morning and met up with Kalyn dear to study. And guess who we saw? Siti baby! She's looks slimmer already! Seets, the Turkish ice-cream man looked really cute in the photo! Hahaha, Seets is  in loooove .  Anyhoos, today was, I would describe as, sinful. I had chocolate truffle, blueberry danish with vanilla ice cream, Italian pizza, baked beef lasagna and heaps more. Feeling a tad guilty now, hahaha. ;) Kalyn you were great today and I can't wait til' Weds!   Kalyn and I caught The Simple Life on telly yesterday and it was really amusing! Paris Hilton actually thought that Wall Mart was a place where they sold walls. If Jiax hears this she's going get so mad! Hahaha.   Happy Fathers' Day! My Dad has gone to climb Mount Kinabalu with my uncle and will return only on Thursday. My Dad is an amazing person and I love him so much. I hope he knows how to fold the sleeping bag. (o'_'o)    Spell of the day:  Riddikulus  (ri-di-KYOO-lus) Defense against a Boggart, forces the creature to take on a silly appearance.

          New Found Glory - Hit Or Miss    Right now I'm having a really pleasant conversation with Vzoj via sms on my mobile phone. It's great, it has brought back many happy memories. Besides that, I'm waiting for Jason to send me the photos we have taken this afternoon at the Hair Salon. It's funny how Jeremy's hair has turned out. But it's so totally rad! I love it! I think we all owe it to Dino. Thank you Dino. Hahaha. ;) Here are they:             I miss so many people. Especially Nana and Fiona, because Nana has returned to Malaysia for her hols, while Fiona and I seldom meet up cos' she stays really far away. I miss Jeremy, Jason and Simon too, but I'm glad I got to meet up with them today, and on most Fridays. Jeremy and Simon insisted that I go to Jurong East library to meet up with them this afternoon, so I did. I loved the bean bags and the 4th story. They're so modern. And the sofas were huge and pretty, they are red in colour!   I think I will study Chemistry now. I can't quite get to sleep, and Punk'd is on MTV. Hahaha!

          Avril Lavigne - Who Knows     Randoms  I am  urlLink 63% Dateable ,  urlLink 16% Stressed ,  urlLink 23% Greedy ,  urlLink 71% in Love  and am worth exactly  urlLink $1,561,130.00    urlLink Star Wars Name : Peaya Irsin   urlLink Porn Star Name : Christie Velvet  urlLink Prison Name : Nipple Nibbler  My Personal Day of Death is  urlLink Monday, December 31, 2091      Hahaha. ;) I'm quite surprised that I'm actually 71% in love, because there aren't any hotties out there for me to drool over. Maybe except for Rupert Boneham. Yeehaw!   Last night before I went to bed, Geets hubby sms-ed me. She made me so happy. She wished me sweet dreams and casted a  Patronus  spell to keep the dementors away from me. I told her to be careful and not fall off the broomstick while dating with Harry above the Forbidden Forest otherwise it would mean trouble if they fell by the Whomping Willow. Geets said she'd rather be kissing Harry while Fawkes shed its feathers on them. Man I love Geets...  Gabriel and I are working on  Project Pia . Actually it's quite silly, it's supposed to keep us motivated to  pia  for our pre-prelims, prelims and o levels. Amesie poo has a countdown thingy on her blog to remind her of  The Big Day . I think that's really cool and useful, but since she already has one on her site, I don't think it's necessary for me to apply for one.  Yesterday as I was watching the show on Channel 8 at 7 in the evening, the little girl asked an incredibly meaningful question -  What is life ? And it really got me thinking. I personally feel that life is full of surprises and challenges. Life is also about enjoyment and being happy. Yes, although there are times whereby we get depressed and all, but I believe that nothing beats having your friends and family around you. It is also essential to be true to yourself. It's not worth living a life of deceit and hypocrisy. Well, that's what  I  feel about life. What about you?

          Mest - Wasting My Time    I dreamt that I saw WeeMei, Bryna.D, Louelle Teo, Bobbie Lee, Trisha, PuiSan, Whitney Chua, Natalyn Bava, Athena Wang, Ng SingYi, Geraldine Hoong, XiaoHan, Marian Wong, Eunice Tan, Lim XinYun, Cassandra Seto, Chloe Cheng, Velda Ng, Phoebe Phua, Linda Chan, Roxanne Foo, Tan JingPing, Natalia Yek and so many so many of them! Dang, was it exciting! (All primary school mates)   Mr Lee  also made a guest appearance in my dream. It was short. He knocked his nose against the office door knob and started crying in front of his students.   The last chunk of my dream was actually a nightmare. HuiYing in particular, a few 4B1-ians, a coupla' celebrities and I signed up for a course to be oppressed by the  Orcs  from  Lord of The Rings . We had to go through a series of excruciating torments - being hung on metal chains high up in the air, on top of huge red beds of coals that blazed and quivered with molten fury. We competed in threes. The person who could do the best flops, twists and turns in the air would win the praise of the Orcs. The other 2 who lost were left to burn. I was up against HuiYing and  Emma Watson  (Hermione). I was left to be burnt. It's all good though. Dying  together  with Emma Watson. What more can I ask for?   Spell of the day:    Expelliarmus  (ex-pel-ee-AR-mus) Causes opponent's weapon to fly out of their hand.

          Sugarcult - Stuck In America    My mum took me to the doctor's this afternoon and doc said that my airways were congested. This explains why I haven't been able to speak and breathe properly. * Sniff sniff * Now that I have my new dosage of medicine, I am not allowed to go ice-skating on Wednesday! Boo..  I grabbed a pair of jeans, 2 tees, a pair of shorts and my S.B! from Raffles City, then my mom, my sisters (Serene and Cherryn) and I headed down to Aunty Mary's shop at Bukit Merah. When I entered her shop, the TYR Electric Wave Female Highback swimsuit caught my eye so I went to try it on immediately! :D The price was  nice  too. $64.90. My sisters got their stuffs and we were about to pay but what happened next was that Aunty Mary insisted on giving them all to us, free of charge! I was so happy I almost carried her up! A pity I didn't get to see  Ah-Ma . Uncle Jacky was there too. Then there's Aunty Irene and LiJin Jie.. I love them. :) I love Mummy!   Jason and I plan to give Jeremy a makeover hair-cut on his birthday. I think we're going to Jantzen. Is that how you spell it? Jason went to Storm and Kimage but he felt that they weren't as good as Jantzen. Jeremy has already agreed to it but as usual, he wouldn't stop whining! Haa haa. I hope it turns out well.    P.S:  Recruit Coolio won Celebrity Boot Camp.  P.P.S:  Learn this:   Expecto Patronum!  (Conjures a Patronus, a silvery phantom shape, usually that of an animal, which is the embodiment of the positive thoughts of the caster. A Patronus will drive away Dementors.)    I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. Mischief managed.  ;)

          Jet - Cold Hard Bitch         I saw  urlLink Harry Potter  and the prisoner of azkaban for the 2nd time and it is undeniably brilliant! If there's one movie to watch this year, it must be this.   Anyways, did you know that the music that the choir sings in the film is written for the film by John Williams and the words come from  Shakespeare's Macbeth , Act IV, Scene I. Yes, the lyrics were written by  William Shakespeare . These are the words spoken by the "weird sisters," the three witches who turn up every so often as the story of Macbeth unfolds, fortelling his fate and creating various awful spells and brewing potions in their cauldron. The phrase "By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes" is spoken by the Second Witch and is a reference to Macbeth himself, who knocks on the door immediately thereafter.              Double, double toil and trouble;   Fire burn, and caldron bubble.   Double, double toil and trouble   Something wicked this way comes    Eye of newt, and toe of frog,   Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,   Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting,   Lizard's leg, and owlet's wing,  Double, double toil and trouble;   Fire burn, and caldron bubble.   Double, double toil and trouble   Something wicked this way comes    In the caldron boil and bake;   Fillet of a fenny snake,   Scale of dragon; tooth of wolf;   Witches' mummy; maw and gulf    Double, double toil and trouble;   Fire burn, and caldron bubble.   Double, double toil and trouble;   Fire burn, and caldron bubble.   Something wicked this way comes!      Brilliant!

          Avril Lavigne - Forgotten     Just a thought..  When people comment and denunciate about how inhumane the Real World is, I tend to disagree with them because I always believe that no matter how horrible one's life can get, there is always something positive and something to look forward to which stands out, what I call -  A blessing in disguise .  People these days have no time to unwind to think about the sweet little things that happen in their lives. We sulk, we complain, we whine. We never think of a solution to our problems. Why? Is it because everyone is too caught up in living in a World of their own and do not want to care anymore? Or is it because we are getting too pampered, so now it's not a: "I need this, Mummy". Instead, it's a: "I  want  this, Mummy.".  How we feel about life depends on where we place our attention. Have you ever noticed that every time you are given a rose it is covered with thorns. Do you say to the giver, "why are you giving me this stick with thorns on it?". Of course not. You admire the beauty of the rose. Even if you prick yourself it never seems to hurt as you are involved in appreciating the rose and the person who gave it to you.  Life is like that.  There are thorns in lots of things we are given in life.   What do YOU focus on - the thorns or the gift?  This is our choice - to appreciate or depreciate the experience we are having. When we depreciate something (complain, not good, fast, big enough, whine, resent) something, it loses value. When we appreciate (be grateful, celebrate, enjoy), it GAINS in value.  It's that simple.  We have much to be grateful for, yet part of the human condition is to take for granted that which is good. It is actually biological. Our brain filters out anything that is not hurtful, fearful or physically moving. This is part of a survival mechanism to help us identify danger. This function contributes to filtering out the good things we have almost as soon as we get them.  What to do?  Cultivate an attitude of gratitude,  practice appreciating  what you have. Look for the beauty, gifts, blessings in every moment. Whatever happens have the attitude that it is perfect, even if you don't know why... YET.  There is a blessing in everything . Look for it and you will find it. And if you can't as yet see it, sit back and wait for it to show up, it will.  Be grateful not only for what you perceive as the good things, but for the gifts that may not be so obvious. Start with the outstanding things, then the good, then the mundane, then the not so good, then the very not so good, then the terrible.  Why the terrible? Well...  You'll embrace them with feelings of gratitude and gratitude feels good the so called terrible things are part of your life so assume there is a reason gratitude will open you up to discover what gift is there for you.  This includes paying attention for the lessons of learning and growth. Shift your focus from the external circumstances to the learning you are involved in. Place your focus on the inner growth which is steady and consistent rather than on the outer environment which is so intangible, inconsistent and uncertain.  Instead of seeing the challenges of life as problems, practice seeing each situation as a gift or blessing in disguise. Then your attitude will shift to one of enthusiasm:  "What new learning is in store for me now?" "What opportunity is here for me to receive?"  Be in charge of where you put your focus. Train yourself to see that which is positive right NOW.  If you can't find something positive, look again. What are you taking for granted. If you can't find anything, hold your breath, within a few minutes you'll really appreciate breathing. :)  Gratitude is a process, not a result. If you think you might be grateful tomorrow, be grateful right now. Cultivate gratitude no matter what is going on. The more you express your gratitude, the more you will discover you are living an abundant life.  The process of gratitude opens us up to receive.  Think about it. Whom do you prefer to give - to those who find fault with every little detail - or to people who appreciate your gifts? The Universe probably thinks as you do:  Let's 'give' to the 'grateful'. And so it does.  Discover for ourselves how powerful the action of 'choosing' gratitude can be.

          Yellow Card - Ocean Avenue     Did You Know...  African clawed frogs were used for pregnancy tests. The frogs were injected with a woman's urine. If they laid eggs, the woman was pregnant.  Europeans used to predict the sex of an unborn child by dropping a frog near the expectant mother. If the frog landed on its back, she'd have a girl. If it landed on its belly she'd have a boy.  -- Posted in the frog section of the  urlLink Vancouver Aquarium    I can't wait to return to school tomorrow. The past 2 days have been absolutely terrible. That's why I hate being sick. :( My fever hit 39.4 Degree celcius yesterday morning and I was petrified. Thanks guys for all the sweet sms-ses. It's because of all your thoughtful messages that make me want to recover asap. :)

          Juliana Theory - Top Of The World    I  kop -ed this layout from Blogger.com because I thought it looked spiffy. :) So here it is - a brand new layout for the month of June.  Well, the holidays have been great so far. I love to go back to school because I get to spend time with my friends like Kalyn, Jeremy, Nana, Jiax, Fiona, Jason, Gabriel and Amelia. In addition, I managed to take some time off to unwind by indulging myself in.. shopping! And sleeping, day-dreaming, playing my guitar, chilling out and just doing all the kind of things which doesn't involve much thinking. Hee hee. :)   It rained this morning and we couldn't go for our morning jog. So Amelia called me and suggested going to town with Kalyn and Melissa. We lost Dear Kalyn - long long story! But I'm relieved that we found her. Haa haa. I bought a pair of flip flops for only $9 at these little tents beside Isetan and they're so adorable! They look pretty - got these neat tiny sea shells on them. I also got this RipCurl sling bag at a 20% discount. YUMMY! That's why I love the Singapore Sale. Ho ho! Kalyn was excited to meet up with Her Excellency but she couldn't make it. * Sniffle * Anyways, Thank you so much girls, I enjoyed myself so much today! :)  I just saw  Celebrity Boot Camp  and it rocked my socks! :) I love it. Hee hee. I was hoping Vitamin C would stay for a longer period though, I like her. Recruit Lamas is so good-looking! I don't think I would continue watching the show if there weren't any attractive guys in it. There are quite a few pretty girls, Recruit Bingham is from Bay Watch. And hmm.. Recruit Coolio is a Grammy Award Rapper. You guys should see it, especially those NPCC and NCC peeps, hee hee. It's on 10pm on every Saturday.   Good night sweethearts. Don't let the bedbugs bite. ;)

          Avril Lavigne - He Wasn't      This is when I start to bite my nails. And clean my room when all else fails. I think it's time for me to bail. This point of view is getting stale.    This is one of my favourite tracks from Avril's new album. I really like it.. It's like one of those sk8er boi songs.  Haa haa ;)    I had my English oral prelims today and before that i saw my source of inspiration! When I waved at  Her Excellency , she was like, "Come come!" Then I followed her and held her huge water bottle and she spoke to me for a while. She had such bee-yoo-ti-pul eyes and her lipstick was like WOW red! Oops haa haa, my maid just asked why was I smiling to myself (o'_'o)  Dear Kalyn, don't get jealous alrighty? Haa haa. I still lub you anyways! Oh yupp, Her Excellency, Dear Kalyn, Ruthie babie, Amesie poo and I are supposed to go jogging tomorrow, but now it's just Dear, Ruthie, Amesie poo and I because Her Excellency has something important to attend tomorrow. So I guess Gabriel and Jiax won't feel much earth-quake-like vibrations on the ground afterall huh?? :P    Jiax and I just had lunch at IMM, we ate something incredibly sinful. * Sniffle * There goes my plan! So tomorrow I MUST run more.. Hee hee. I bought 3 pairs of coloured socks and 4 new rubber bands. YUMMERS! ;)    Now I'm just sitting in my living room,  anticipating  the next few hours of tuition. Poor Jeremy is sick. Get well soon brotha!    Mucho thanks to Choochoo, Fiona, HuiYing and Siti who helped out with the Class Project Boards! Oh yes, and all the ideas for the National Day Fun Fair, they're overwhelming thanks to Dear Kalyn, Jessica, LiuMing, Siti, Ruth and all who contributed! Wow great 1st week of June!

      It's been so long since i've updated! I never thought i'd return to blog here because i've been so busy. i've been involved in all kinds of stuff, this makes my last year in ctss so memorable and fufilling! it's like as though i've really done part as a clementeen. i'm really proud of that, i wish that everyone else will make full use of their years spent there. it's not very long period, neither is it very short!  The class and i will be washing cars on this coming friday for the school fund-raising project and i'm exhilarated! the funds will be used to assist the needy pupils, who genuinely need the help of each and everyone of us. please donate generously during the fund raising fair on friday! the proceeds would also go to our graduation ceremony.  Alrighty, that's all for now! take care ya all!
