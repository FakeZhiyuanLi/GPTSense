      Saturday.   Boring one, work is as usual.  Meeting with group members as usual. Movie alone as usual.  The story of troy reminds me the famous book i read. The homer of Odyssey. i think there are just legends. The movie has no depth and the ending suxs i think.  War scenes feels like LOTR also. Maybe it should give more background information and explanation to the story.   It's the work of gods behind these men etc.

      it was last night, besides hearing my parents of what the mini-tragedy we have for the family, i also heard 2 other stories which are in deeper pits.  i call the story "one-time folly" and "mother's woe".  ok now for the "one-time folly". once i have a old neighbour, typical type of aunty. she has only one daughter. their age gap is vast i guess the parents have married late. i believe there was generation gap problems, and her daughter sort of went astray, doesn't care about studies etc.  Years has passed, suddenly we recieved a wedding invitation from her. i thought it was a good news but to think of it, apparantly, she was only 18.  it indeed was a shotgun marriage.   Years after and after as of yesterday. she got 2 childrens by her husband left her! this left with her mum alone to support the household. being lowly educated, i dunno how long they can hold.  ok second story later.  everyone knows one of the great asian virtue is filial piety. seems that modernisation and western influence have eroded these values. well, its my old neighbour again, childhood playmates. i'm glad he is doing well now, with a stable job , gf etc. time passes and its time for marraige, but in the end he assumed that his parent will pay for his wedding as he himself and she spent everything they earned?  Ok enough of stories, i'm out.

      this is one of the special bus ride i have to town. as usual, i went up the bus groggily brushing through the mobs of people, trying to find a rest spot. a seat would be really like a gem to me. instead, i found a little space at the joint of the double-bus whatever you call it.  the start of the bus ride was seemingly dark, even though it is morning, i guess it was the act of weather. usual habit, i started to whip out my newspaper, devouring the news section by section.   unknownly, my eyes starts to wander around after i got bored with the news. suddenly something caught me, a young woamn wearing pink blouse and black shirt, she was standing the way facing back from me just opposite me. nothing special at first then a guy drop off and left a space for her. she turns around, wow guess what? she looks my primary school sweetheart.   i can't really describe this beauty perfectly, not neccessary appeals to all guys. i knew it by heart, haven't seen anyone like that before in my life.  i was observing her, her hair was kind in a slight mess, her eye seems lost. the tension was immense for me, many times i wished i could talk to her, my heart just froze when her eye met mine. for that split second, i think she had noticed my untidy bunch of newspapers then she looked away.   Few minutes after, she dropped off at orchard road, don't think everyone shop this early.   For once, i think i really liked her and she is the one. i guess this is what people described as infatuation.   Now i can't do anything about it. i could just keep her image in mind and move on with life.

      woooaahhh...great movie. quite rare to see an action movie to be highly rated. i guess it really deserved it. Action is breathtaking, love is touching and the pace is just nice, the whole movie is just complete. hopefully the coming part3 would be on-par standard or even better.  anyway aside from this, there is few stuffs i need to settle this week. soccers , interviews and meetings.

      Haha, i'm doing this blog with my trusty laptop, for FREE of course.  I was trudging my exam notes and laptop to the nearest macdonald.   Was behind this young couple, saw a nice young lady with a dog and her partner dark tanned, smoking away. Another example of bad boy wins struck my mind.   Compare to me, i'm still a poor snob heading away to mug my books. I think i'm still not moving yet sigh.

      Nothing much.   Downloaded a SCVD movie, a chick flick. I took ages to figure it out. MPEG2 is supposed to be played by dvd player.  The rest of the day doing work, and figured the zero configuration network stuff. Wireless technology is still disappointing. Realibility is still not there.

      Weekend played some interesting board games, had loads of fun. Followed by marathon movies troy and day after tml. Woo, they are great.  Monday nothing un-usual except for a chatup by a shanghai babe. the feeling was good, it would never happen in the real world unless she's a saleswoman :p  it would be an idea to work there as an expat, but i don't think the salary can match here in singapore.

      today marks the day of me crossing my first quarter century of life. most people would rave about this occassion every year of their life, usually holding celebrations with their loved ones or friends.   Gradually i'm begin to see less of this purpose, it should be a happy event, but i think i'm just shunning away from this. i would rather choose the day to be  reflective of my life. I remembered for a particular job interview, the ang mo interviewer asked me whats my greatest achievement in life? then i blabbered and boast my proudest work related to the job. apparently he was taken back, he just didn't expect such answers. there must be something meaningful in life, you should remember.   maybe its time to payback the community as you had taken much from it. sometimes life is simpily too hard in s'pore to stay afloat, so nobody seems to bother anyway. i don't believe making small donations helps at all, a big one in future makes a difference.   perhaps now is the reality check, what i have done for the past few years.i'm a person who is focused in life, what i want i will work for it, no matter what. At 22 i got my first degree, 24 i bought my first commercial property and hdb. 25 i'm on my way to masters and began to make big time investment. i have to do all these to reverse the ridiculous cost of living in here now, i don't have a rich dad for a start. from time to time, the feeling of loneliness still creeps at me, like a disease, i'm seeking strength to go on which i'm getting less.   Right now i'm staying at the dull govt job, its really the time to move on next year.
