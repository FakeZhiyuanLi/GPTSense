      OK, so... Highschool is suppose to be the funnest years of your life.  Your last years of innocence before your let out into the world to go to wild partys and get high at college.  I don't go to "Wild Partys." Like most kids in highschool.  My friends and I have "nerd partys" The guys with systems bring them over and we sometimes hook up XBOX's and have Halo parties.  This is the life I am happy with.  When I tell people I don't go to keg partys they seem to look down on me.  "Im boring" they say.  Ok, so to not be boring I have to go get smashed and have sex every other day.  Thats good for all of you, but I choose to keep my head on straight and wait until college.    Another thing about me, is that I have recently discovered my religion.  More like, started caring.  I go to Christian rock concerts, lift my hands up in worship and praise god.  It feels good, I can feel him in my heart.  Its a security blanket to me.  Hes watching over me, and I can talk to him whenever I need him.  Yes, Things have happened that prove to me that he has listened.  Im not a bible hugger, I sin more than some.  Im no goodie goodie thats for sure.  So you know what, people need to get over it.  Ok, so about why I started this rant.  Today, I had another horrible experience in Orchestra.  Zachary, my love, my nerd, my bishounen shares a stand with the pagan whore.  They are friends, and I cant stand it.  But I know that I can't make him stop being her friend because I can't stand her.  But he was SO FLIRTY.  I couldnt even play my violin I was shaking so bad.  My stand partner Kara had to keep sidetracking me so I would calm down.  But he was leaning in to talk to her, she was touchin him, They even moved their chairs closer together.  I know, Zach is naturally flirty, but this was pathetic.  I know he loves me.  And I know I sound pathetic, but yall would have to see the girl.  Shes so annoying!  No one likes her, the friends she does have are only pretending so as not to get on her bad side.  They looked like a couple, and I felt like the outcast.  Im on the other side of the room, while they are laughing and having fun and flirting in their own world.  Zach's eyes met mine a couple times, he would give me a sweet smile, or look at me like he was sorry.  But then, two seconds later.. he was back to it.  Needless to say I was mad at him, but.. hes so damn sweet, and I know theres nothing between them.  So AGH!  I don't know why Im worrying about this.  We've been together for 10 months, why would he blow it all to date a whore like her.  Not to mention he is also a christian boy who would never like a satan worshiper.  Like any relationship though there is always doubt.  It doesn't help with the fact that they went to homecoming last year together, which means he thinks shes cute at least.  But, he did ditch her that night for me... so Im just gonna stop right now.  Life is good on the other foot, my friends are there for me.  My boyfriend is there for me, when... hes not... trapped... sharing a stand with.... that... thing.  Oh well.  Life's short, I must enjoy it with every fiber in my body.  Even though those fibers are telling me to murder.  -supresses the hatred-  Im good, really...

      So many things are changing in our lives.  Things that make us hate, and love.  Ive just started my junior year of highschool, and its going to be a very weird ride.  My good friend Greg, who I have named Shorty, is leaving us to go to pennsylvania.  He is one of the most pure people I have ever met.  Full of talent and kindness that you would never see in the everyday person. Its hard to imagine that he will be gone. ILL MISS YOU SHORTY!  Another thing that is impressing my life is a girl that I have hated since the very beggining of last year.  She was annoying last year, before she fell in love with my current bf.  Back then she was just a loud and obnoxious freshman.  Now she is my mortal enemy, the lieing, backstabbing, satan worshiping, whorish sophmore that I have come to hate.  Being a good christian girl, hate is actually a word I use alot.  God forgives they tell me, and I believe them.  But, could he forgive me for murdering the spawn of satan herself? No.  Hate is a feeling from the devil that fills up our mind and tries to drag us away from God.  This brings on the quote "Love you enemys." I find myself drowning in my hate though.    Today my friend helped me realize that I have been pushing away God throughout this fiasco.  Instead of asking him to guide me through, I have ignored him completely and decided to hate instead of embrace.  Maybe If I had seeked his help earlier I would not have jeapordized my very sanity just to be obsessed with her murder.  Today, me and this pagan whore got into a battle of words.  I was shaking from head to toe I had so much adrenaline pumping through my system.  Oh the hate I can't even describe in words.  No one in this century could.  I would describe it by a bloody vision, but that would make my mind sink further into my dark feelings.  I have come to the conclusion that I am to seek God's answer, and he will answer me in a way that is just for my actions and that I will be happy with.  So it is here I end my entry and turn to my thoughts.
