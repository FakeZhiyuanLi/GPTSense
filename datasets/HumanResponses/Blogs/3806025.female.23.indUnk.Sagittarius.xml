       consciousness requires effort, opportunity, and perspective.  i will take you through my perspective as opportunities present themselves and i'm forced to display my effort.  as i gain wisdom from my young, female dc-insider position, you gain access into the process and the dreams it took to get there.  granted; i will make mistakes and, at times, you will disagree, but i will also create successes and drive our collective human spirit forward as media provides me the opportunity to pursue my greatest effort and share my perspective all the while...  this is day one.

       This morning I called the Senators from my state, Jim Talent and Kit Bond, to express my opinion in opposition to the Federal Marriage Act.  Their staffers seemed surprised.    Below is the proposed Amendment:  "Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution or the constitution of any State, nor state or federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups."  Although 11,000 proposals to amend our Constitution have failed, the discussion this morning in the Senate on whether or not to seek an amendment to ban gay marriage, abolish gay civil unions, and disenfranchise unmarried straights and gays of many of the rights married couples receive is of the utmost concern this political season.    In one corner, Senator Tom Daschle (D-ND) claims although he envisions marriage as a union between men and women he does not believe this amendment was brought to Congress in the right fashion (through the Judicial Committee) nor is it appropriate to rush the discussion of such an amendment as it is indicative of the political season.  In the other corner sits Senator Bill Frist (R-Oregon), who believes FMA should become the 28th Amendment as the 27th was a silly little thing on Congressional Salaries...such that this one is of much more importance (he reiterated the word "bedrock" a few hundred times).  Good spin boys, good spin...   How badly do I wish to be the obnoxious kid in the stand who shouts out: declaring that that silly little 27th Amendment was originally the 11th suggested alongside the Bill of Rights in 1789, but that it took an additional 203 years to be ratified & that furthermore, two days of discussion in the Senate might be a little inappropriate to pass an Amendment.  But Bill knows that...   He also knew that this vote on Cloture was going to fail... No where near the 60 votes needed (48-50), but that the missing two votes (Kerry & Edwards) could be used as political fodder.    Oh how the machine feeds.

       The middle child in my family is a sixteen year old boy with a tendency to overtip all waitresses no matter how badly they serve, find the kindness in all sorts of animals I won't go near, and trust without doubt in his president to make honest/moral decisions.  Tonight, I took him to see a documentary called "Control Room" about the role Al Jazeera played in the Invasion/Liberation of Iraq.    My opinion is that the highlights of the film revolve around Donald Rumsfeld making statements about Al Jazeera and 'truth' while we, the viewing public, have now been informed of the lies and the manipulation he and this administration have cast unto the American public, onto my brother.  Back to my brother, it kills me to see him upset by what he didn't know.  After the film, I took him over to Lafayette Park, the grass and benches in front of the White House, to discuss what he thought about the film and its topics.  At first, he was slow to open up as though he was processing the words to best describe how the film made him feel... finally, he said he doesn't know what to believe anymore.  Most strikingly, he lamented that while watching the nightvision attack on Baghdad he had not realized that those bombs weren't so "precise" as to keep from killing/injuring civilians; men, women, and children.    He concluded by expressing his appreciation for the optimistic Hassan Ibrahim, former journalist with the BBC now at Al Jazeera, for commenting that America is the world's strongest country and that he believes in the US Constitution and knows that America will stop America from such unjust/illegal action.  I agree.  It is up to us, in this election, to show how American foreign policy has been hijacked to suit the mission of Bush and his elitist supporters.  If you have a Landmark Theater near, go see "Control Room" directed by Jehane Noujaim.

       One thing that must be said about Clinton; love him or hate him, the man's a magnet.  Here it is... said to be the hottest day of the summer to date, and, at 9 am, he's got a line stretching five DC city blocks (they ain't short blocks people).  I'm giving up on meeting the man today, but I'm not finished until I get my copy of his backbreaking 956 page memoir signed.  Here’s why I’ve been enjoying this book: you are inside the mind of Clinton… the way he sees it, the opportunities he’s had, and the way it affected his sense of self.    Check out this except from 1996 on page 390:  A few days before the election, I went down to New York for a long-planned fun-raiser.  I wondered if anyone would come, even if only to see a dead man walking.  As I made my way through the Sheraton Hotel kitchen to the ballroom, I shook hands with the waiters and kitchen workers, as I always did.  One of the waiters, Dimitrios Theofanis, engaged me in a brief conversation that made him a friend for life.  “My nine-year-old boy studies the election in school and he says I should vote for you.  If I do, I want you to make my boy free.  In Greece, we were poor but we were free.  Here, my boy can’t play in the park across the street alone or walk down the street to school by himself because it is too dangerous.  He’s not free.  So if I vote for you, will you make my boy free?”  I almost cried.  Here was a man who actually cared about what I could do for his son’s safety.  I told him that community police officers, who would walk the blocks and know the residents, could help a lot, and that I was committed to funding 100,000 of them.   Call him whatever you will.  This man had an opportunity to make a real big, fat difference… and from what I’ve seen/know, he did scores of good.  He worked ceaselessly regardless of what was happening in his personal life or who was attacking… he strove forward b/c he understood that this opportunity would not wait upon things to get easier or better.  I wish him all the best and hope that soon enough I’ll have a chance for two signed copies.  One for me, and one for my moms.  She loves the guy too.

       My 8th grade teacher, a frightfully large woman with hardened opinions, once rebuked a student during our history lesson for commenting that politics were boring.  I watched as Mrs. G carried her weight with a new heaviness... she approached with fingertips outstretched to rest upon our desks as a general coming to inform his troops of sacrifice. My class teetered backwards in our chairs, straight-backed in anxious bewilderment as she hovered over our outgrown desks, her face taut with the grave message she must distill for our understanding.  For a minute, it seemed my heart had stopped.  It was the first real lecture I’d had in my life.  The preacher across the street handing out pro-life signs never had the conviction raised within this middle-aged Italian woman, no, this woman was overcome with emotion as she ranted; spat; and declared her explanation for the struggles of our common American ancestry.  Each of us stared with bug-eyed wonderment, but it was the retreating figure of an old soldier taking a seat that seared her message to my young life.  It was if the ancients had spoken.  i swore to her that i would vote. and even if her points have all been debunked,  demystified, and deconstructed a 100x in my mind.   she was right.  i should vote.   I should also know which candidates support my ideological war for peaceful respect and thoughtful bridges over borders; drawn or imagined.  So, I've decided to take HRPR to the World.  You see, in college, I had quite the culture shock.  I came from a mid-western, single-sex Catholic schooling community.  Yes, it was privileged and most of the time, I felt no one was making any sense.  I was instantly a rebel.  A feminist determined to introduce more information then parental explanations to my classmates.  In retrospect, I held a few underdeveloped political ideas, which I loved swirling around and inside my thoughts.    But college was a whole new ballpark.  I chose to study in GWU's Women in International Leadership program for the additional access it provided into DC's political landscape.  My classmates alone represented the diversity of our small world.  My closest friends were pulled from all continents and religions.  It was with these friends that I learned much practicality from the rhetoric of the classroom.  Together, in our senior year, I pitched a few of them the idea of a PR firm loyal to the ideals of higher education and positive community-building.  We called it Human Rights Public Relations.    Our mission became to raise the profile of campus events designed to benefit a social or environmental cause through paid and earned media.    We also united campus organizations under banner events when their goals were in synch.  The benefits became significantly increased when members of various groups interacted more frequently and developed new ideas and programs for their organizations.    Near the same time, I successfully pitched the idea of GWU TV to a university vice-president.  GWU TV would have been one major benefactor had the station gone up.  Students were already registered with HRPR as organizers, actors, financial advisors, newscasters, and rappers; an immediate database for on-air talent and station developers.  I graduated too soon with my dream internship to take this idea to fruition.  Instead, I worked with A. S. in marketing and public relations at one of DC's top film production houses.  Then, I trolled the Internet selling hotel rooms through dozens of sites across the country.   Solar energy was up next.  I tried to protect the environment and develop good Native American press through building schools with solar energy.    That was all before I began this blog.    Now, I am going to re-establish HRPR at GWU and other colleges across the country.  Calling upon my friends around the globe and the US, I hope we can engage students through their beliefs and show them how the personal is political.  I want to help introduce students to their peers varied ways of thinking in hopes of opening minds while providing the access to the routes of express oneself; namely voting, but everyone has a worthy contribution to our worldview.  This is how I will repay Mrs. G, this is how; I want to get the vote out.
