      Again a stressed day… The people around me are really keeping me occupied, not to mention myself. I’m not even getting much sleep, and I don’t eat much… It’s starting to show on my skin and in my eyes. But with all this stress I don’t even have time to wonder about my life, so I’ve literally stopped cutting and running myself down. But the more my life gets back to normal, the more I miss Lars. I’m starting to hate that there isn’t more then 7 days in a week, 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour.  What I ate today:  00:06 a bun  12:00 an apple 18:00 a few French fries  Today at gym, I had to concentrate on covering my old cuts all the time, but I don’t think anyone noticed. I fear how people will react if they saw them, and weather they would tell my mother… For some reason I’m suddenly really interesting and fun to be around. I don’t know if it’s just me who is finally starting to get my eyes open for the person that I am. It feels like I’ve just woke up from a bad dream, but again, I’m afraid to get to accustom with this bliss. I know from experience that it can suddenly disappear just like that.    Monday 29 marts   This day was a really great day. Everyone was positive and happy, and by everyone I also mean my parents. But it was also a stressed day. I had to go to the dentist, school, work (for 1 hour), hairdresser, badminton, homework and on msn so I could talk a little with Lars.  What I ate today:  06:00  A bun 15:00  An apple   Time is passing away so quickly…

      I’m so afraid…  Today I was really depressed… I had no desire to eat or do anything. I only wanted to sleep and lye starring out my window. Me and Lars are back together again, and that makes me happy to think about, but I’m so afraid the same thing as the last time is gonna happen again. Having to commit to him again and this time even closer, puts a lot more at risk, but I wanna trust him. How can I ever find bliss if I wont allow my self to take the chance. I hope that he will understand if I wanna wait until we are past the number of days we were together the last time… cuz only then I’ll dare take the last step.  With this relationship back on, there’s again a hundred new things that I have to consider. I have to think everything carefully trough and I have to take more responsibility for my actions. My parents are happy for me that I’m back together with him, cuz they know that I will have someone  I trust and listen to, to support me in this “disease”. But my mom is a little concerned weather history will repeat itself, cuz she thinks that, that will be the final push towards the edge… I hate myself even more for having to be so careful about this, when all I want to do is let go and give in to it completely.   What I ate today: 1 bun 1 banana 2 cups of low (0,5) fat coco    Saturday 27 marts   This morning was a bit strange… For the first time in this year I was allowed to sleep for as long as I wanted to (normally they just start washing my clothes and vacuum in my room), and when I went downstairs to eat something (around noon) my mom had cooked eggs and warm some coco. Everyone was in a really good mood. I was just sitting there feeling more and more abnormal. I wasn’t in an especially good mood. I had had this dream which was about me and my troubles. I don’t remember it exactly, but I was shivering when I woke up. I wish I knew what it had told me… maybe it was telling me when and how all of this would end.  The rest of the day was going pretty smooth. I watch a movie and my best friend came over around 7 and at 8 we went to the dinner in Hvam. She then gave me my late birthday present, which was a bottle of fisherman (she knew that I had longed so badly to drown my sorrows) When we go there we went into the gas station next to it and said hello to Lars(he works there) Then me and my friend went in and had some French-fries. We shared one plate, but we could only eat half. We come there once a week, not because we are hungry or anything, but because it’s a place where we can talk alone, and it’s a place my parents don’t know about. It was really nice to sit there and talk about anything and anyone.  Lars came over later that evening. We sad and watched a movie and had a beer (in my case a Smirnoff and fisherman) we started talking about something. I can’t exactly remember what, but I do remember that I thought we have so much in common. We can talk about anything nothing is awkward. Without getting in to details, then the bottom line is, that we are back together and he stayed over night. It wasn’t the first time I slept with a guy, but it was the first time I really felt comfortable with it. Not having to think “how will he react when he sees me in the morning” or “my god what if I snore or falls down from the bed.” But nothing like that happened. He held me so there was no way I could fall down. Which actually is the perfect image of how he is gonna have to hold me from falling out the edge... I’m now depending on what he does with my trust.  What I ate today:  For the first time I can’t tell you exactly what I ate this day, cuz I didn’t really gave it much thought, but it wasn’t more then usual.   At last I would like to let you know that even though Lars has made me happy again, then I can’t stop this disease right away, not even if I wonted to for his sake... I’m in to deep…!

      I’m so mad at my mother…yeah she’s back :( She has hardly walked in the door before we start arguing. She has hid my razors so I can’t shave my legs (or cut) She is telling me she’ll only give me one at a time, and that she wants it back afterwards… I hate being treated like that. I’m not a child!  I’ve asked her if I could hold a party next weekend, but she’ll only let me hold a small one! I hate her! But I know a couple of ways to let her give me permission ;) I can just say that if I can’t hold this party, then I’ll get really miserable, and get depressed again. I know it’s cruel, but I don’t give a damn anymore.  Lars has promised me to come over Sunday evening for a movie night and a beer. He couldn’t come today cuz he was going to a party elsewhere (funny how I’m suddenly depressed), but I’m really glad that we are becoming such good friends again, and now that he knows who I really am then I can relax around him and stop holding back. I hope he doesn’t cancel on me cuz that would be to hard on me…  My best friend Christina is coming over this evening; she called earlier and asked what I wanted as my present (she couldn’t afford one when it was my birthday) I think she is giving me some liqueur.  Otherwise this is gonna be a really slow weekend…  I’m still trying to lose weight, but it’s hard cuz I’m getting tempted everywhere  What I ate today: 12:00 A sandwich 16:00 3 toast with lever pâté 18:00 a salad and some pasta  I promise to write again tomorrow :)   Tuesday 25 march   Today I really freaked out. I was afraid of my wait loss and started eating a lot What I ate today:  6:00 a bowl of serials 12:00 a sandwich 15:00 3 cream puff (flødeboller) cuz my boss held a competition between my and my colleague 18:00 3 pancakes with ice cream  After that I freaked out again. Disgusted by myself I started running. I ran even though my legs were acing as hell. I ran until My lungs gave in and it hurt so much that I couldn’t stand so I fell down and stared at the stars while I was trying to control my breathe.  Later I talked to Lars on msn; he really made me feel better. For some reason he can always make me in a good mood.  I would also like to thank these friends who are there for me when I need them :)  Michael (cuz he is the only one in my family who knows how it feels like, and can handle the truth) Lars (cuz he can always make me feel better, and he doesn’t judge me) Ambivalence (cuz he doesn’t make me feel like I’m the only one like me) And all those who doesn’t know, but are good to me so that my life is a little easier

      Man! My life can really change 180° over one night. Last night I was talking to my x on msn. For some reason I was suddenly feeling really happy and he made me laugh. Sometimes I haven’t done in a long time. Lars, you don’t know how much you mean to me… And even though I only had 4 hours of sleep, I slept better than ever.  Another thing that is making me get in to a good mood today, is that my mom is taking a curse for two days. Now I won’t have to eat dinner :D   Otherwise there isn’t so much to say. I’m in a good mood, but I know it’s gonna go down hill again pretty soon. I’m just not good at being happy, so it’s really strange how Lars make me laugh.  What I ate today:  6:00 a bowl of serials (I was in a good mood cuz I slept so well) 12:00 an apple 16:00 4 wine gums (Henrik, my colleague was being generous, so I couldn’t refuse)  But that is all I’m gonna eat today…   Yay!! iv'e lost 1,1 kg :D my weight is now 64.2 kg I'm gonna keep losing weight yeapy!!!!

      Hi again  Yesterday I made my 7 and 8th cut while I was showering. It was the only thing that seemed sensible to me. I had no other options… every one had deserted me, and the one’s who were there..? I didn’t want to disturb them. I made the cuts on my upper arm, so my parent wouldn’t see. I just have to remember that I can’t wear shirts with short sleeves now ;)  This whole thing may sound weird or repulsing to you, but to me the cuts are pretty. They are a relief to my burden. (Hard for others to understand)  Other then that, this day has really been strange. It was a combination of good and bad things…  Weight: 65,3  I started my morning by waking up to late (my damn alarm clock is so unreliable) Not that I care if I’ll make It to school in time, we were having gym. My first thought when I found out, was that I couldn’t show them my cut’s, so I started to fake a message from my parents, that I wasn’t feeling so great. But I was in such a hurry, so it didn’t get convincing enough. When I got to gym a friend (surprisingly) helped me fake the note. I’d never saw that coming. Anyway my teacher believed it, and I was off the hook, thank god (or not, I’m not christen)   Oh! And I bought a new scale today. It’s really accurate, so now I can monitor my weight. I want to lose 6,2 kg before the big party, in the Easter vacation (which is in 16 days!) . I think I’m gonna have to keep a schedule, to stay on the path. The only problem is that my mom is starting to suspect me for starving myself, and that doesn’t help our situation at all. She is now checking and demanding that I eat and stay at the table till everyone is done (we have never had that rule before) o0( I can’t wait till I’ll start loosing weight) I envy everyone who is thinner than me, and that is a lot of ppl…   Here What I ate today: 10:00  An apple 18:00  A handful rice (I’m finally starting to get it under control… :)  I chewed gum all day and that took my bad breathe, cuz you get that from not eating.  Later…  I was forced to eat dinner, but managed to get away with only eating handful rice. Again, I hat to sit there and wait till they were done eating (and they took their time). God! I hate those dinners cuz my mom “mentioned” my cuts again, and my dad threatened me with foster parents again (see! I told you he was faking, when he said I never would be sent away).  I hate them more then ever now… So as soon as I could I went up to my room and blared my music  My mom came up to my room a few minutes later (off course) and we got into a fight with each other. I confronted her with the fact that I felt like they only wanted to get rid of me. She told me that they would only do that if they felt it was for my own good (why don’t I believe them?). I got really pissed at her and yelled a lot of things (she did to) but what I was basically yelling at her, was that I didn’t want to tell them anything about me or give them my confidence, cuz I always felt they were judging me, hating me even more. To them I’m just some repulsing mistake, which never should have been born.  Her last comment as she was leaving me room in anger with me (still) yelling after her was: “Thank you for the confidence” (meant sarcastic of course)   Where is all of this gonna end?  When is this nightmare over?

      Monday 22 march, 2004  When I got up this morning I wasn’t too happy about having to go downstairs and face my parents, so I took my time in the bathroom. I hate the mornings. Here I think everything through that happened yesterday, and I also regret the mistakes. I wish I could stop thinking so much, but I can’t. I went downstairs and took the smallest bowl I could find and ate some serials. I was still determent to starve my self today, so I didn’t eat too much. My mom was watching me from her place besides me. I knew she was gonna say something about my cuts, and she did! She asked me what all my classmates say to them… (She only thinks about what other thinks about it, not why I have them) But no one from my class knows… My cuts were hurting real bad this morning, maybe it was because of the cold.  “Cold inside as well as outside”  In school everything was the same. Nothing had changed. Everyone was disgustingly happy. I just sad there and pretended to be the person everyone thinks I am. I’m so good at this pretending that they’ll never know the real me. Watching them from inside this happy girl at their age, I realized how childish and naive they are. I sometimes fell much older then them.  As usual on a Monday, two of my friends and I were going out for dinner after school. On the bus over there I was suddenly in another place. I couldn’t understand what my two friends were saying. And the world around me disappeared. I liked it. I didn’t want to leave this place so I just smiled and nodded to my friends when ever they seemed to look at me. Why this happened? I don’t know… But I was free for a short moment.  When we got to the restaurant, I didn’t want to eat anything, but the smell of fried chips tempted me (and I ate half of my chips!!) I hate myself now…  So I promised myself that I would work extra hard at badminton. Luckily I managed to escape dinner :) But I’ve got to buy a new scale, one that is accurate.  What I ate today:  1 small bowl of serial ½ portion of fried chips 1 sandwich  I’ll probably run just as much tonight if my legs aren’t to weak. Otherwise I think I know what else there is to do… ;)

      Sunday 21 march, 2004  This has been a really shitty day just keep reading why  Last night (2:00) I flipped out (I started to eat uncontrollably to comfort my self). I ate a piece of chicken from dinner, a banana, 3 toffees, a half back of jellybeans and finally one bag of microwave popcorn. (I discuss my self)  When will this madness stop?!  After breakfast (they forced me to eat) my dad told me (sarcastic I think) that I was getting to skinny. My mom laughed at me and said I was getting to fat. All of this made wanna starve myself even more, but when do I get the strength?  I’m thinking of redecorating my room, cuz I’m spending more and more time in here. It’s my private cave. So every time my mom just walks in it feels like she is invading my life with force. Redecorating it may make the invaded space feel like mine again.  I wanted to go out and run, run until I didn’t have any more food in my stomach or I collapse. I ended up just jumping on my trampoline, hating myself for not having the will power.  Later on today all the sudden my father comes whit 4 pots and a pan, telling me that my grandmother is giving me them, so that I’ll have them when I move away(this only strengthen my suspicion that they wont me out of the house)  Last night (2:00) I had an eating flip. I ate a piece of chicken from dinner, a banana, 3 toffees, a half back of jellybeans and finally one bag of microwave popcorn. (I discuss my self)    Shit! My mom saw my cuts. She has been questioning me for the last half hour. She thinks I’m doing it because I want to punish them. (Now I’m gonna stop eating so that she may start realizing what’s wrong. Cuz I can’t tell here she won’t understand that it’s her) She even suggested that I’ve would go into foster care..! I always suspected that she wanted to get rid of me, but now I know. But then my dad came, (and of course demanded to see the cuts) and he told me that he almost started to cry (and he never cries) He stood by me, he even threw my mother out when she came in again (that meant a lot to me, but it feels fake) I know my mom is gonna keep asking me what my problem is… And I’m gonna keep refusing to tell her because I wont to protect her from the truth; witch is that it’s her fault and I don’t love her anymore  What I ate today:  8:30        for breakfast I ate a small bowl of serials. 12:00      I ate a home baked bun with a thin layer of butter (I got to stop eating!)   15:00     I had plum pie (my favourite) I’m starting to believe that my parents are doing this on      purpose   This night I ran until my lungs gave in. I collapsed on the ground trying to catch my breath. I stared at the stars, and it hit me; There are so many of them, who is gonna take their time to learn their true nature and how on earth can you tell witch stars is witch?!  It’s the same thing with us – humans  When I got back to my room I started doing sit-ups until my stomach cramped, but I didn’t feel empty. Tomorrow, tomorrow I’m gonna starve my self

      This is my first page in my new “diary”. I was inspired by a new friend of mine, who I met on Excasco. Excasco is a Forum for ppl who don’t want to live or have huge problems, like me…  Last night I had the weirdest dream. I dreamt I was going to Mallorca on holyday and I wanted my two best friends with me, but they didn’t want to come along, cuz they think it would be funny enough. So I had to chase them in a kinda future space station or something.  And I’m the kinda person who believes that dreams mean something, and I translated this dream to this: Mallorca is an symbol for something I look forward to, something good in my life (and believe me there isn’t much of that) but my friends didn’t have the same point of view (cuz I’m a lot different from them) But I really want them to see me as me (that’s what the chasing means) The future space station thing, means that I’m in a place that’s alien to me. Their world!  My thought: It’s sometimes funny how dreams can tell you something you don’t want to admit to your self.  Today I also started starving myself again. But it’s hard to get started after a week of normal eating. But here is what I ate the entire day: I started by eating a mint pastel (cuz my throat aces) Then around 12 o’ clock I drank 2 cups of low fat water coco (cu my throat still aced) Then I started to run a little,but it was raining and freezing outside, so I had to quit after 2 km (not very long)  And then my (stupid) parents made my favourite meal (chicken) and I couldn’t resist, but I only had a small portion. Now I just feel like I’ve let myself down again… Why can’t I do anything right?! I can’t throw it up again. Sticking two fingers in my throat don’t help. Why I don’t know, but it’s ignoring. I hate my body!  Today I was also feeling really dizzy. I think it was the overdose of pills I took last Wednesday. The affect does first really kick in 3 days later. I was so dizzy I could hardly stand and my eyes was blacking out all the time, so I lay down and slept for 6 hours. A waste of time if you ask me.. but then again I can’t really find anything else to spend my time on. Why I even bother living is a mystery to me…  My mood today: I have been in a bad mood all day. Snaring at every one. Drawing my self away from the rest of this sick world.  And I finally told my mom that I don’t want her so called “help” in this. And I don’t want to give her my confidence. Now she is officially a stranger to me. But it is probably also best this way, she is the biggest reason why I’m feeling like this. She is always putting me down and she has never loved me so… why bother? I know now that my life is going down road again after the few days in my life that Lars (my now x boyfriend) made better. I know now that I’m probably not gonna live through this…!  Before it gets to boring, I’m gonna finish this page in my life by telling you that I’m only gonna spend the rest of the evening by watching TV.

      20 march, Saturday 2004   About me   First you need to hear a little about the girl who is sitting here, writing this, sharing here life. My name is Maria. And I’m today 16 years old I live in Denmark, a small (boring) country. I live in a… well huge house with my parents and little brother. About a year ago I started having suicide thoughts. But my depression started 2 years ago. It’s still a mystery today what caused it, but I suspect it to be my mothers fault. If you wanna know it more detailed, just keep reading. If you don’t, just skip the following and start reading the next section. Here goes:  When I think back today, I now realize that my parents (mainly my mother) never loved me. The only thing I can remember from my early childhood is rules and material “love”. My parents have always given me huge presents. I now know that it is out of guilt, a replacement to real love. I can’t recall ones that my mother has ever kissed me or hugged me, and she has never told me she loves me. It has always been my father who came and said goodnight to me. I had this friend, when I was about 8-10 years old; I used to love sleeping over at her house. Her parents were always saying things like “I love you, honey, sweetheart and beautiful” to each other, even to me! Then (both) her parents, would come and say goodnight to us both and kiss us. That felt really strange to me, but I liked it. That family will always be the perfect reflection of a family in my head. Until I saw that home I didn’t know why I felt so unwanted in this world, but now I know. That girl doesn’t know how lucky she is. If it wasn’t bad enough to never feel loved, my mother also gave my unreasonable demands. She was always comparing me with her, and her perfect life. I was constantly being told how high grades she had, and how skinny she was. Everything was perfect in her life. She even met my father when she was 15! You may not think it sounds so bad hearing about your parents past, but she told me indirectly that she expects me to be the same. Every time I get a grade for something like 10 (B+) she always told me how she would get 11 or 13 (A, A+). It always caused a huge pressure (that’s why I hate competitions) on me. I always felt like I was competing with her. She did all this with my weight (I was born extremely thin), height, friends, boyfriends, and my look, just everything… When I fell and needed her comfort, she just rejected me and told me, that I was being a sissy. And when people, I knew, died, she wouldn’t even comfort me; she would just have a stone face and let me know that showing emotion is a weakness. That’s probably why I today can seem a little cold and cynical. When my grandfather died (2001), I was the only one who didn’t cry at his funeral. My feelings were too complicated. I didn’t want to cry, because my mother would see, but I cried inside. That whole incident broke something in me. It made me conceal all my emotions inside, and it made me push people away from me, especially my mother. Living in this huge house makes it easy for me to avoid my parents. I would just bee in my room whenever I was home. A lot of things, that a normal teen would need her parents comfort at, happened the next couple of years. I started in a new school where I had to make new friends. It was also starting to be the time where my grades were important to my future. My body was starting to change and I gained weight because of the shapes I was getting. Then after 6 months in my new school (I was already friends with everyone) one of my (now) friends (who had lost her parents, big brother and his girlfriend in a car accident) started to have suicide thoughts and began cutting herself, and if that wasn’t enough she was beginning to get bulimia. She was the most popular girl in my class. Everyone looked up to her and would do anything for her, except me (I’m not like most people who is faking to bee nice just because someone is popular) Well this girl got sick off all the fake people around her, and strangely enough she started sharing all her thoughts with me. We became very good friends cuz I found out that she wasn’t like the girl everyone gave me the impression of, she was real, not fake like everyone else. She latter on had a pill addiction and was taking up till 10 pain killers a day! One day she just had enough of life and decided to end it all with an OD of pills. The only problem was that her ant (who she lived with) had thrown out all her pills, and she wasn’t old enough to buy more than 10 (a law we have in Denmark) but I was! At this point I didn’t know about the pill addiction, so I went with her to the pharmacy and bought a bottle with 100 pills. My teacher the next day announced that she was committed to a psychiatric hospital, and I now realized for what! This really made me sad and depressed, cuz I should have known. 2 months later another friend of mine gets committed the same place, only this time it’s because of anorexia. All these events made me extremely blue and depressed. I couldn’t even enjoy Christmas. And again when I needed my parents the most, they weren’t there. Over the 2 years this whole thing has lasted I’ve felt like I was more mature then anyone else, making all my friends seem so childish. Their worries seemed so unimportant compared to mine. Their biggest worries would be weather they had a sit or if this boy liked them and so on. I had no one to talk to, no one who would understand me. All these bottle up feelings made me very frustrated and depressed. But no one could see it on me, cuz I was pretty (at least that is what every one says) and I got good grades (not coming from my mother) and I didn’t have any enemies. Then finally the pressure of it all got too much for me, and I broke down. I skipped school to be at home holding a knife to my wrist, fighting for my life. One night it got to much and I took the nearest knife (a blunt hobby knife) and placed it on my wrist, where a visible vain was, and I cut. Because the knife was blunt I had to press really hard and several time on the same place. It was painful but I enjoyed the thought of daring life. I watched the blood for a while and held my arm like a mother holds her newborn child (cuz now my pain was born, it became visible for the first time) I no longer had to keep it inside. But you have to understand that this wasn’t a cut to feel the pain, it was a suicide attempt, but the knife was to blunt, so I had to give up. I thought about cutting myself a lot the days after, but I didn’t I had found an alternative. I began to write. Since then I have tried to cut my wrist again, but my causing walked in on me, and I’ve tried taking an OD of pills. And just 5 days ago I tried cutting my wrists again, but I stopped because I wasn’t sure if I wanted to end I yet. I don’t know if all this makes me an SI, but I am suicidal and if you want to following me battle for life just keep reading my Blog

      What has happened?!  I feel like a split person. On one hand I’m the perfect school girl, who can’t seem to do anything wrong. On the other side I’m still a lost girl who isn’t even sure if I wanna live or keep my non-cutting pact… But as long as I’m only confused I’m not gonna do either of the things  My “best” friend Christina, who has no clue of what I’ve been through, is constantly trying to ague with me. She wants to ague about simple everything from witch gum flavour I prefer to witch way to enter a door. I hate it; I’m not ready to face normal school life yet. I miss something in my life. I don’t know what exactly but I wish I had a clue. My mom and I are acting like nothing is wrong, but at every chance we get, and then we fight. My dad is really inside anymore, and I can’t blame him, its hell in my house.  What I ate today: 2 bananas A pack of gum 1 kit Kat 6 energy bars (low fat) 1 ice cream 1 steak and some potatoes 2 bananas 1 cop of chocolate 1 chocolate muffin  As you can see I binged a couple a times today, once at work and then again later on the evening. I hate it and I wish I could just stop eating!!!

      I’m here without you…  Yesterday my mom had been going through all my stuff in my room. She found one of my poems and a book about suicide under my bed. Luckily she can’t get into my vault where I keep my pills and stuff. She confronted me with the book (that’s how I found out) She asked me what she was gonna do with me (well mom try learning to accept me!!) She suggested that I would be place in a closed institution. NO WAY!! If there is anyone who is gonna go there then it’s her :´( She thinks that I’m reading the book about suicide just to figure out a way to do it (which was true) but my brilliant lies saved me again. I told her that it was just another one of my morbid obsessions (since I was little I have loved horror and death. Every time someone died in a movie I was just fascinated or falling down my chair of excitement) she believed my story and left me alone, but she took my key to my room. Later on the evening she suddenly acted real friendly and as if nothing had happened (well she had “only” messed through all my stuff and looked in my garbage) I had to try and make up with her so I didn’t act mad just played hard to get (hard to fool ;) )  I’ve been writing with Lars again. One day we started talking about us. He actually told me that he really cares about me, cuz I kept appearing in his head. Ever since things has been weird about us. We seem to flirt and act like to pair of ppl that likes each other. He picks me up every time I fall to peaces. He is not good at acting fast, but he can make me think of other things just like that. I’m going to a party this Saturday. My friend who is holding the party says that Lars is gonna be there some of the time. I really hope so. It would give me the chance to either show him that I’m over him (I’ve already found the perfect victim to flirt with) or maybe get to talk to him, and start things up again. I don’t know before I’m standing there in front of him. I’m not even sure which way I prefer, but I’m here without the one guy who constantly pops up in my head. Today I even kept thinking how that particular situation would be like if we where together, and I ran in to him twice in a day. Today has been a perfect normal day, well normal as in before I became what I am today. My dad and me got to be home alone for a couple of hours, and I actually found out that he is a pretty funny and cool dad. All I ever wanted in a parent. He doesn’t surveillance me and treats me like a 13 year old. He talks to me like he does to adults. Thank you dad!  To bad he isn’t like that when my mother is home :´(

      I hope he his hurting the same way that I did!  I sent Lars a text message that would look like I meant to send to another guy. I just wanted to make him jealous, or make him hurt. It apparently worked cuz he hasn’t written back on my last message. I don’t know, sometimes I feel like I can feel what he is feeling. Maybe it’s just my intuition telling me what I can’t se for myself. There are sometimes so many signs that he really cares about me, but lately he has been rejecting me and even been laying to me… But I see through him like glass, analysing his every word and move. I hate it but I can’t help doing it. He means a lot to me, even though he has put me through so much pain. I can’t take it anymore, so I decided to do something that would clarify his feelings for me. I want him to hurt while knowing that I’m not gonna wait around for him always.  I’m so close to cutting again. I thought about doing it several times today, and I’m still thinking about doing it, but should I let Lars have a chance to keep from doing it again? Or should I tell him afterwards and hurting him even more, although it might make him stop talking to me…?  I don’t know where this anger all the sudden came from. I just know that I’m really mad at him today, thinking back at those lies he told me yesterday. I swear if he was here I wouldn’t know if I would hit him or kiss him.  Otherwise, my life sucks here at home. I’m distant and fighsty as always. Nothing seems to wake me interest. The food seems boring and tasteless, and my parents are irritating me no matter what they do.  I’ll keep fighting for not to cut, but I no longer have a reason not to, so why bother…

      I've tried…   I promise you all that I would try. I tried so hard to get well. I don’t really have the energy to write about it all tonight, but to summit it up: Lars got me to wanna live again; I found a reason to live. My passion for him grew this weak, even though I skipped a couple of day at school to have time to find out if killing myself really was the answer, when he in some miraculous way gave me the flame back. I saw life green and light as you all see it everyday. I wept over such beauty that I had missed going around soaking for two years. I got a taste of the life I bled for. Now all I wanna do now, that my wounds are healed, is to get back in that security. How could I fool myself believing that he cared and that anybody cared? I play tricks on everyone’s mind, but understand this: I don’t do it to hurt you, just to survive and protect you from the pain I cause to all that I love. I can’t help it, it’s my curse. Therefore I’m not worthy of the gifts I so wrongly was given. People tell me that I’m beautiful and have a beautiful mind. I keep hearing this no matter who I ask. I wont admit this to myself, cuz I guess I deep down long to think that my mother is right, and hasn’t said all those things just to hurt me. This night is poetically hard on me. I wrote to Lars and asked for his help. I wrote to him that I needed his company to keep me from cutting. He did what I had feared so much, he chose his best friend over me. I know that his friend had trouble with his girlfriend, but it wasn’t something that would get in the way of his life. Lars hasn’t even written to me, asking if I’m still all right. I know now that I love him. I’ve just been kidding myself all along. I wouldn’t admit, that needing a person so much that he or she became you’re entire reason to live, was what love really is about.  Some may say that life has been unfair to me, and that I deserve better, but I know that with the resources I have been given in birth, then I should be able to be the most happy person on this planet. I had every chance to become what we all crave for so much, but something went wrong. I chose pain and death over joy and life. I’ll never trust a person enough again to wanna stop the one thing I find peace in. Every time I seem to let myself be carried by a friend, then he drops me, and I brake.    Can I ever trust someone to save me again?

      There is basically not much to write about today. My life suck and we all know it now. I came even closer to take the pills. This time I ended up sitting with them in my hand, 25 white pills. I even wrote a message on my phone to Lars that I was gonna end this, but then I came to think that there was so many I wanted to say proper goodbye to. The list became to long and I realized that it would take some planning this thing. DAMMIT! I knew there was gonna be some ties that would hold me back. Therefore to remove a couple I’m gonna write a goodbye note here, just so it’s done:  Don’t be sad if I’m one day not here anymore, life moves on. I have no real regrets in my life, nothing I would like to undo. I don’t remember much from my childhood, except that the first 12 years was great. I don’t really know at which point things started going wrong, I guess it’s bcuz I’ve always been different then that mask you all see, and it became to much for me that you like it more than the real me. Not that that is the basic reason, just the thing that triggered most of my problems. I found a few ppl in this world that I felt I could tell how I really felt, and if it wasn’t for them, then I would have felt all alone and wrong. I would properbly had killed my self much sooner. My only request is that someone will tell my parents about all this when I’m gone. Make them see why I did it.  Love Maria   Remember this note if I’m suddenly is gone, but till then I’m gonna keep this stupid live going and keep pretending to be someone else…

      Life can be so cruel sometimes. I don’t know if it’s me who invites pain and misery into mine, but at the moment it just seems to keep coming down on me.  I tried to drown my sorrows at a party yesterday. I simple had a plan to drink till I became numb. Not a care in the world. I wanted to let go and be like everyone else, so what did I do? I flirted and drank. This constant search, for something that feels like love, looks like love; it’s slowly starting to remove the little part of dignity I got left. Is it worth it? At the party ppl were enjoying them selves. It was really a success party. 2 ppl went down at 1 am, but nobody threw up. I got really drunk after an hour, and ppl kept giving me more and more to drink. I lured booze out of some random guys, it was so easy. This boy who I know likes me pretty much, was also trying to say something to me at the party, but I turned him down and gave him a lame excuse for not having the time to listen. I knew what he was gonna say, so I would rather not having to reject him again and in that way hurt him. As drunk as I was I didn’t realize that I already was hurting him pretty bad. I heard later today that he cried a lot afterwards. I feel so miserable for hurting him like that. He doesn’t deserve it and I don’t deserve his affection.  I started talking to four of my best guy friends. They all agreed that if they were my boyfriend, then they wouldn’t constantly brake up with me like Lars does. They would keep me, and be proud of me (their words). I felt a strange emotion at that time. Something I hadn’t felt for a long time. I felt appreciated. I believed in those few seconds that everything ppl say I am is true, but the feeling disappeared when I received a message from Lars. For some reason he makes me feel like I’m not good enough. It’s not something that he says, that makes me feel that way, but it is knowing that he doesn’t want me. This boy who I know likes me pretty much, was also trying to say something to me at the party, but I turned him down and gave him a lame excuse for not having the time to listen. I knew what he was gonna say, so I would rather not having to reject him again and in that way hurt him. As drunk as I was I didn’t realize that I already was hurting him pretty bad. I heard later today that he cried a lot afterwards. I feel so miserable for hurting him like that. He doesn’t deserve it and I don’t deserve his affection.  Of curse I invited Lars over to the party. He was at another party in a city a little away from here. Even so he took a cap and drove to the party I was at. It coasted him 300 kr. (30 pounds) and he only arrived when the most ppl had gone home. It confuses me more then ever. Why does he do this just to see me, when he apperantly doesn’t like me enough to wanna be with me? We went to my place after making sure that a very drunk friend of mine got home safely. We talked about a lot of different things, I’m not exactly sure of what, but mostly about us (that doesn’t exist) When we got to my room I put on a video and laid my head on his chest. I can’t remember what started it, but all the sudden we started kissing. Things lead to another and the next thing you know I wasn’t a virgin anymore. The one principle I had the one last dignity I had left. He took it, not by force, but still. I feel so slutty, now that my first time was a one night stand, but I don’t regret it. I’m glad it was with someone I at least like. Now that I’ve given him everything I can give him, and he still doesn’t want me, then I feel so worthless, so empty and unimportant. Am I really that plane and boring?  I’ve almost found out where my mother is hiding the big pill glass. She fetched me one earlier today bcuz I got hangovers, and I barely heard where she has hidden them. So close in every way  I’ll update my blog tomorrow as usual, and if not, then there is something keeping me from it… you know what… *hugs*

      As I said yesterday, then I went to the pharmacy to buy the pills I’m gonna use someday, but when I got there I spotted razor blades of the kind that doesn’t come with a shaver. I thought to myself that I had to have them (the once with the shaver can’t cut deep enough), but I had to choose. I think the clerk would get suspicious if I bought those and a bottle with 100 pills in. I chose the blades, but I’m gonna get the pills tomorrow. I’m not giving up this idea. I feel so trapped without my last resort under my bed, ready to set me free. The new razor blade is really sharp, just by caressing the skin, it cuts through and makes it bleed. It would be so easy…   It’s now 3 months since my last suicide attempt, and I’m already back in that ditch again. Life seems more beautiful than ever, and that hurts. Knowing that something so beautiful can be so wrong! Maybe I’m just supposed to fail this thing called life. My mom certainly thinks I’m a failure. I came home and found a note from her saying don’t do anything wrong (she means drugs or something like that) WTF! I’m not doing drugs. She has this idea that I’m up to something bad, and she’s right, but she doesn’t know the extent of it.     I have to live a double life now, at school I’m just as popular as I always is. No one could see what I’m really feeling if they wanted to. I’m so good at acting and lying that I don’t even look depressed.   I made 3 new cuts and cut the four old ones. That makes it my 25th cut. How did this come so fare?! It bleed pretty much, so I watch the blood run slowly down my pale skin. I started writing “hate myself” with the blood on the bathroom floor. I couldn’t hold my tears back so I started crying sitting in the shower with the water running and all my clothes on.    I binged 3 times today, I’m thinking of trying to purge again, maybe this time I’ll get it cuz I’m home alone. I’ll update this Blog when I’ve tried.  Hugs to ya all

      This morning when I woke up, I felt more depressed then I’ve ever done in six months. I was sad no matter what. If it hadn’t been because I had to go to school, I would have killed myself today. I’m that close now... I kept thinking on how it would be like after I was gone, and I kept trying to notice everything that went on around me, as if it was the last time I was gonna see it. When I finally got to school I had no energy left to be social. I kept feeling extremely tired even though I had got all the sleep I needed. I so badly wanna just quit on everything now, not just cut. I went 12 hours between every meal today. I think I’m gonna keep that rhythm till I can stop eating for 24 hours and so on.  I’m actually planning on buying the pills tomorrow, just have them ready. The situation at home is getting worse. My mom suspects me for everything now. No matter what I do then there is something wrong with me. Then she says I’m on drugs, sleeping with all the guys, not making my homework, online to much, not eating, eating too much, not helping enough around the house. I could keep making examples just from today.  People who doesn’t know bugs the hell out of me. They are so ignorant and superficial. Even my teachers bug me more than usual. I can’t concentrate and I can’t focus that long.

      What went wrong!?  This day started out so great. I hadn’t eaten in 15 hours, but then I bought a banana and a bun. I ate the banana but only the half bun. 9 hours later I’m eating dinner with my parents. For some reason I couldn’t help myself. I ate two tacos. They didn’t have so many calories, but still. The only bright side about it is that my parents no longer suspect me for starving myself (I’ll just exercise it away)  Later on the evening I tried to purge/puke/throw up call it what ever you want. I couldn’t do it but I was so close. I was desperate to get the tacos out of my system, so I found a pro-ana site on the web and read a few tips about how to throw up. I want to be able to do it so badly. Until I learn I have to keep starving myself, and in order to prevent myself from binging, I have made a scrap book with pictures of myself and skinny models. That way I can compare with them and lose the urge to binge. I call the scrap book “thinspiration”. I’ll write a lot of tips on how to keep the lust and hunger away. I hope it works!  I’ve never looked better than now. My skin is clean and my make-up is perfect. But I still think I’m ugly… I don’t have any self esteem. I’m still fat and I’m still depressed. What’s wrong?! Why am I not happy? I just wanna die! – I think about it more and more often. The only thing that keeps my occupied enough till it passes is my new obsession with food… I’m even starting to dream about it, and imagine how my farewell notes and funeral is gonna be. I know that I’m gonna need help soon, but I can’t get it… My parents won’t let me get it, and I don’t wanna tell them if I’m not gonna get anything out of it. Another day alone in my room can be fatal   I don’t want you to worry about me, what ever is gonna happen it will be in my own free will, and I’ll be happy

      TOday I flushed my breakfast. It was the first time I did that, but I know now that it isn't going to be the last. My mom is getting suspecious. She forces me to eat, but I manage to avoid it by staying out of the house. I got my BMI today. It's on 20 when i lose 2 kg more it will be 19 and thats underweight - yay!  I'll try not to eat more today but it's so hard I  ate a bag of veingums in the cinema :( Fortumeatly I didn't have to eat dinner so it's easy not to eat anything else today   After I had been to the cinema with my friend, we walked around in Viborg (a kinda big city). It was nice seeing that guys still looks my way when I walk by them. Twice they even stopped their car and started talking to me. In a way I want this, but I know that it's just to feel wanted, not because i'm interested in them. I do what men do so often with women, I objectify them... DAMN!  I'm saying goodbye to me and Lars's relationship tonight... It's not in my good will, but I know that I can't stay in the same track much longer. It's a shame though - I really liked him, but I can also see how this is best for him, and I only want was best for him.  I'm still not sure weather I schould show him this blog, but I can't explain all this to him again. It takes time. Afterall I did write a post for him yesterday... I think i'll show him tonight if he want's to read it...

      I hate my life more then ever before…  Lars wrote to me last night. He told me he needed a brake again, but since I had already made it clear that I didn’t want that, so then he broke it off, for the last time. He told me the truth this time… He was still not ready for a relationship, after the last one he had, that was a disaster. He also told me (not in words, but that is what I think) he only kept getting together with me because he knew, that if he didn’t then I would find another guy and he would lose this for good. I can understand his actions completely, but I just wish he would have considered the fact, that someone like me can’t handle this. I need stability, not these ups and down that I suffer under daily. I no longer wish to hurt him, since he is already hurting. In fact I wish that he would get over it and move on. I am starting to see everything clearly. I’ll miss being told that I’m sweet and beautiful, cuz that’s what I need to hear in order to believe it myself.   So my mom doesn’t think I’m gonna freak out again and cut, I told her that it was me who broke up. I don’t need her to fuss and wanting to check my body all the time. This whole thing has just brought so many problems. If she finds out that I’m cutting, then she is gonna send me to foster care.  I wish that someone would bring me back to life, give me a reason to live again.  I’m a poisoned reptile. I flirt to lure them into my trap. I use them until they are so damaged that I have no need for them anymore. I do all this out of selfish reasons. I need to feel loved, to feel wanted. I don’t escape from my life by drinking or taking drugs, I fool my self into thinking sex is love. I sometimes take myself in thinking that I would do anything to find this “love” that I so crave for. I would even lie and force myself to do stuff with a guy just to hear those few words.  Why should I not be able to do this, I’m already dead inside.  The little girl who I used to be isn’t gone she is just trapped. Trapped in a dark dusty place, where no one can find her again.  I want you to know this Lars if you are reading my Blog: I read the first time that you wanted to brake up, when my cat hat just died. I needed an ear, a shoulder to cry on, but you reacted by braking it off. At the time I didn’t know the real reason cuz you protected me from it with a lie. Deep down I’m grateful for that now, cuz it could have been the push over the edge, but my hart still froze to ice and I stopped eating and sleeping for a long time afterwards. You really meant a lot to me back then. Hell I even think I had begun to fall in love with you. A week passed by and we started talking again over msn. I made it seem like I was in the best mood ever. I showed you the side you first saw and probably fell for, and then I started flirting. I made you see another side that I hadn’t use for so many years. I guess this was the time where you thought I was over you and ready to move on and find another guy. I’m only guessing, but tell me if I’m wrong. You panicked and thought you need to act fast before I slipped away. We sat up a date at my house. It was exactly 2 weeks and one day since we broke up. We had some to drink and I got a little drunk. The rest you know, but all in all we started up again. The next day was hard on us both. I know that now. I was depressed and scared that you would hurt me again, so I cut to create the pain before you did. I luckily felt better after a couple of days and I became happy again. When we finally had pasted a week I told you that I now felt secure with you again and that I wanted us to get “serious”. I wanted to take the last step, not because I felt forced or anything, but I had found THAT feeling again. You told me that you wanted us to wait until we knew each other a little better. My theory is that you already at this point knew you couldn’t stay in a relationship much longer, so you knew that taking the last step would only make it harder on me. The next day you wrote to me that you wanted to take a brake. This time something died in me. I felt so useless, why couldn’t he just love me? I was sure now that such a thing didn’t exist for me. My parents don’t love me and no else does. I crave for this feeling. I linger and bleed trying to achieve it. I’m so desperate that I find myself flirting with guys I don’t even like, just to feel loved, even if it’s just sex, It’s all I deserve.  After a week I start acting like I was over you again. I was my old self. The Easter party came up and you saw me like the girl I am around my friends. You even saw me flirting, lucky you didn’t hear what I said. I don’t do this in a relationship, but I knew this was the only way to get you back. Without realizing it, I forced you to be with me… I made it obvious that I didn’t want to be single much longer, no matter the prise. You know the rest of the story, but do you know that my capability of loving a guy was gone. I was already broke. I can no longer trust a guy, and without trust there can never be love. We have now been together exactly 2 weeks if you erase all the brakes, 3 if you count the week we were on a brake. That isn’t long, but I’ll always remember it. You really changed me, and also saved my life at first, even though I’m back at the point I started at when we first meet.  I only want to remember the good moments we had together, cuz they where priceless.  -Waking up at night when I had a nightmare, but seeing you laying besides me, and holding me close when I froze, made me calm down and sleep better then I’ve done for a long time.  -Waking up with you and seeing you with those cute glasses.  -Talking to you even though you had fallen a sleep again -Talking to you in that chair, and while we were watching a movie, and when we walked beside each other after a party. - sitting in my coach listening to you telling me about you’re life. - flirting with you over the phone, msn and at work. - The way we found each other is a funny story in it selves - Knowing when you where gonna call and write to me in the middle of the night - telling my friends about you - arguing about who made the song Amish paradise and me teasing you with the car accident and that I always exchange you’re beloved city with Fjelsø (a very small city) - being reminded of you when: I hear something about you city, smelling my pillow, listening to techno, seeing the movies we saw, being in Hobro, Stumbling over one of you’re pictures, looking at the string on my curtain and a lot of other things.   At many points I did some things I had never tried before, with you, and you made me like it. I guess many aren’t as lucky as me.  - Thank you - And forgive me for hurting you…   Later on the evening I cut myself again it was my 13th cut but my 7th wound. this time a new cut ubove the others on my arm. I also binged, but I panicked afterwards so I tried to throw up, but I couldn't. I know I'm gonna succeed soon, and then I'll be able to seriously start loosing weight - yay!  I went running to. I ran up the dark road wich leads to my house. I kept running til my chest aced so badly I could hardly breathe, but my stomach was empty afterwards so now I can go to sleep with a clear consience...   I think a lot about how i'm gonna end this life. will it be an OD or from slitting my wrist? I'm not really depressed just tired of life... But i'm not going before I've said goodbye to everyone so don't worrie - you'll know...

      I was too drunk…  I’m sorry I haven’t been writing for a long time, but I can take myself together when I’m getting a little better (or I think I am anyway)  Thursday I went to this huge Easter party in my town. I and my best friend Christina first went to a pre-party with 5 other girls and her big bother and sisters 6 friends. I had been in Germany that day, so I had bought a lot of alcohol. I was writing (sms) with Larson all day, flirting like hell (I can’t help it, but I flirt a lot, it’s a sort of self-confirming act, that’s supposed to give me confidence, but it doesn’t) I had been out buying new clothes, watch and make-up. All in all I spent over a thousand crowns (Danish coin) that day. When I got to the pre-party I started drinking right away. I didn’t care about myself, I just wanted to get drunk and fast. On the outside I was happy and in a party mood, but on the inside I was a nervous wreck. I was nervous because Lars was gonna be there and a bunch of other guy I had been flirting with. What was I gonna say to them all? No one knew that me and Lars had gone on a brake… When it was finally time to get to the party, I was so drunk I could hardly stand by my self. Inside the building the party was held in, there was already a lot of people, and I was hardly through the door before I met 100 of my friends and people I know through them. Everywhere there was people wanting a hug and wanting to know where “my boyfriend” was. I just told them that he wasn’t here yet (which was true) but I left out the brake part. I decided to go dancing with some friends. While I was dancing, people were still coming for a hug and to hear how everything was. All the sudden I spotted Lars by the entrance. I panicked and tried to hide behind a friend, but I knew it was hopeless so I changed my plan. I found some guys whom I know like me and I started talking to them, flirting and hugging them. I knew Lars was gonna see it, and he did. All the sudden he accidentally bumped into me. Apparently he also knew the guys I was talking to. We said hallo to each other and I gave him a hug. Then he went over to some other friends. I remember thinking that I didn’t really want him back cuz I felt like I could get anyone I wanted (I think it was because I was drunk). I started dancing again, but this time it was more sensual. I danced very close up by a friend, and I could see Lars was looking my way sometimes. At this point I only cared about the party. I felt the way I did in seventh grade when none of my problems had begun yet. Busy in my own thought, I suddenly felt a hand on my shoulder, and there was Lars, standing with a beer. I took a sip of it with confident, looking at him like I didn’t care about what had happened between us. I guess he saw me as the girl everyone likes, cuz he asked me if he could talk to me outside. Drunk as I was, I agreed to go with him, but on the way to the exit I (on purpose) hugged a lot of my guy friends. Outside he asked me right away, what we should do about us. I at first was acting like it was up to him and that I really didn’t cared, but meanwhile I was thinking: YES! YES! Cuz this was exactly the kind of confirmation I craved for. A guy who was to attracted to me to stay away from me. He started explaining why he went on a brake the last time and how he would like to try again. I knew that he probably was only saying this cuz he was physical attracted to me, and I knew that I really just wanted to have a boyfriend for the look of things. I don’t really like him in that way any more. We agreed to be together again. But one thing that still lies in the back of my mind is this little thing he said before we went inside again. He said “Okay so now we are a couple again, so let’s go inside ad party on, and I think that you should talk to all the boys you want to and see if you still want me afterwards, cuz you know that you can get anyone you want, so I want you to be sure before it gets serious” WTF did he mean by that?!  It makes me wonder if he said that so the same thing would go for him, or if he really meant it. But I did as he said. I found two boys from my class and walked around with them. I got drinks from them and I flirted as usual.  I ended up with Lars anyway. I went with him home and we slept together (not as in sex) the next morning I just laid there in his arms. I was happy in a way, cuz I got what I wanted (I always do), but I still didn’t feel anything. No butterflies in my stomach or something like that. Last night he stayed over night at my place, and I told him that I wouldn’t give him another chance if he broke up with me again. I think he got the message. Forcing your self to be with someone you’re not in love with can really get you down, so I cut myself yesterday, an hour before he came. I managed to cover it with a shirt and he didn’t see it. I’m beginning to realize that I have to test him. I’m gonna see what he does when I show him my cuts and what he is gonna do if I call him up when I’m really down and wants to cut. I want to do this so I can see how much he cares about me. We have to get a little closer first so that it will really hurt him. In a way I want to se him suffer, the way he made me suffer.   It’s a different story with my parents now. My mom is accepting Lars as a part of my world now. My dad is really anxious to get to know him, but I won’t let neither of them getting to close to him yet, I’m still afraid that it will hurt to much when it’s over again (cuz I know that it’s not gonna last)  Btw I’m down to 62,3 kg but I just binged and ate 150 grams of chocolate :(   I’ll keep writing how it goes

      How can I explain this right…?  I’m at the state where I’m getting abstinences from cutting. I want to CUT! But the ones I can count on holds me back. Wraps me in their arms and hold me warm from this blizzard of cold ice daggers. Nice to know someone cares and isn’t scared and repulsed by me. I’m planning to stay up a long time tonight watching a movie or two, but I’m so tired all the time. I have no energy left.  I was also taking this quiz on the I-net. It told me I was extremely depressed and should seek professional help. The results didn’t surprise me at all. I have been really down lately. I’m supposed to bee happy since its Easter brake. What’s wrong with me?! I now know that it isn’t mainly the thing with Lars that’s keeping me down; it’s more the future… Will I ever meet someone loyal? Someone who won’t leave me like that all the time?  Today I was talking to a very good friend from exasko on msn, and he kept me from cutting twice today. We were talking about how ppl like us feels and is misunderstood by others. He can really put words to all my feelings, and he made me realize something’s I didn’t want to admit to myself. I’m addicted to life… I don’t want to live, but I can’t help having a hope that something good can happen so I stay alive on the hope.  A smart thing I said today: Knowing evil does not make you feel safe  It means that when you lean something you either like or dislike makes you fear it coming back or long for it to come back… You will never be satisfied. Knowing how it feels to be held in guy’s arms at night, being safe and cared about makes you crave for it again…  I hope I’ll make it again tomorrow... forgive me everyone if I don’t make it trough the night, but it is long, cold and lonely now that I know how it could be…

      Why…?!  Must I go down that road again? It’s like I’m drowning in the middle of the ocean, with nothing but a lifeguard. I have to fight to stay on it, and when I finally get up on it,  I fall off, having to fight even harder to stay alive. Sometimes it makes you wanna give up and just let go.  This time I allowed myself to become happy again. I felt this huge bliss, but I knew from experience that whenever I do that, all bad things come back three fold. I know it sounds odd, but I felt it coming yesterday, and to prevent it from hitting too hard, I cut (that’s why I did it yesterday)… I broke down crying afterwards, realizing what I had done, but I was right… A lot of bad stuff happened today. Lars and I went on a brake; I got into a fight with my mom. All of this was happening on my best friend birthday; I had to keep on a smiling face for her sake. I took her out for dinner, bought her a present and went to my place were we saw two movies (to movies about happy, never ending love) All the time I kept thinking what had I done… After she went home, I started crying uncontrolled… It changed into a rage. I threw my stuff around, screamed into my pillow and sad staring up on the dark sky. I couldn’t eat anything; I kept feeling sick every time I saw food. My self-confidence was gone completely. I felt that if I would loose weight, then maybe “someone” would care about me again… All I wanna do now is sleep, escaping this world. Flying of into a new and better one that would only go as I wanted it to, but somehow they all turned into nightmares. Scary monsters scared off the people around me. Leaving me behind to join them…  I have promised a lot of people that I would stop cutting, and I will… It is a selfish act witch hurt the ones around me more then me. I have finally realised that they don’t make anything better, but worse. They no longer relief’s me from the pain; I know now what does…

      I’m finally back…  This week has been really stressful. I have had so much to do and so little time to do it. It’s all in a blur, as if it wasn’t me. I was all the sudden this happy girl who seemed to have everything under control. Well I used to anyway… Back then everything was so simple. Just as I thought, this girl is the one who is popular and funny. She even won a poll about who was the class best friend…  My urge to cut is even bigger than before, but I can’t. I’m afraid that Lars will hate me, and turn away from me. Even though I’ve promised hi that I would tell him when I’m really down, then I can’t get my self to do it, cuz he has a life to live and I don’t wanna take the blame of pulling him away from it. How can I!?    SHIT!!! I did it anyway. In a weak moment I grab my key and unlocked this little box 'i have, full of raizorblades, pills and pictures, And I took a razorblade and cut my arm again. That was my 9th and 10th cut... I tried to contact Lars, but he didn't write back. I know there could be a lot of good reasons for that, but I kept thinking that maybe he didn't wanna talk to me... I'm so down at the moment... It seems like a million years until tomorrow where we are together again.  My weight is down to 63,1 kg So far so good right? Now I only need 6 kg more.  What: I ate today:  12:00 2 bun and an apple  that’s all I’m gonna eat today, but i'm going to a family bithday so it's gonna be hard not to eat :(  This page is moving soon to this adress: www.mydiary.dk (so that I can show you pictures, poems and etc) That's all i'm gonna tell ya today, but I promise to keep this updated.

      Hmm... what to put dow before I go to sleep? I'm not really sure how to describe my life at the moment... I was as I wrote earlyer partying all weekend, but appearently my body couldn't take it and my hart started beating like creazy and I got dizzy all the time. I've been diagnosed with stress. The dizzyness and the hartbeats where just a way for my body to scream out for me to slow down. I could have got an hartattack if I had continued me partying. It dosn't scare me to think about, but what does scare me is the reaction ppl had. Lars got really worried and called one of my friends and asked her to stay with me one night to keep and eye on me cuz he couldn't be there. Even though he told her not to say he had called her, then she told me, and I was really amazed. He really cares that much about me. To me it wasn't a big deal, since death dosn't scare me, but my friend and the few ppl I told was really chokked and ordered me to relax. Lars came over last night to keep me company even though he was really sick and had to go to work early morning. He took a cap and slept in my room even though he wouldn't get much sleep since I don't sleep a long time any more, and even though his contacts would hurt like hell next day. He did all those things for me... More then I deserve  Things are also changing with my rents. I had a long chad wiht my mum one day. She was uppset with me, cuz I had broke another promis to her. This was the second time in two days and she was on the verge to forbid me to go to the party saturday. I had no other choice, but to sit down and start a painfull and hard convosation with her: I had to face her like an adolt even though she would treat me like a child...!  We came out with a couple of groundrules and an agreement to let me be more independent and grown, IF!... I could earn my way to it.  So fare so good right!  goodnight to ya all

      I’m back  I’m sorry I haven’t been writing much these last couple of days. I’ve been wanting to, but couldn’t find the time. These last days have been disgustingly happy. I’ve been sleeping at Lars’s house every other day. I’m getting to know his entire family better and better. I feel like I have a second home now. His mother is so nice and kind to me. When I’m his arms at night he always whispers in my ears that I’m so nice and sweet and that he really likes me. When he does that I freeze inside and don’t know what to say back. I mean the same thing about him, but the words surprise me every time. I’ve never been used to be complimented or felt so loved. This whole thing is new to me, but I really like the feeling. All of this makes me even more scared. I can hardly sleep when I’m at his place, cuz I’m afraid to wake up and it’s all over. We are closing in on our 7’Th day anniversary and that’s about the longest we’ve ever lasted, so I feel like I’m nearing my own doom. I’m constantly battling myself, trying to convince my self that I shouldn’t tell him about my last suicide attempt. He’ll only end up blaming himself, and pushing me away bcuz he would be to scared to hurt me again. But the word “I’m sorry” is so close to finding their way out of my lips when I’m looking at him smile to me in the morning. I guess it’s my conscience that’s trying to ease itself, but I won’t allow it to hurt him. One night when he is sleeping I’ll whisper the word to him, in my last hope to get rid of this guilt. I had almost caused an unbearable pain on him. I almost killed myself, leaving all the questions floating around the air.  Anyway we aren’t taking it slow anymore, we are officially a couple, and I‘ve started telling it to ppl. I was too afraid before, cuz it would make it too complicated to get over him again. I really have faith in that we can make it work this time. So much has changed since the last two times.  Well that’s all for now cuz I’m gonna get out and get drunk for the next 3 days :o)

      Hmm… If I have to right about all that has happened the last 2-3 days, then I’m gonna need a lot of space on this blog. I’ll try anyway  Thursday I was supposed to be at this birthday party with 65 ppl invited, but bcuz we broke a lot of stuff that Wednesday, then the birthday girl had to cancel. I ended up writing with Lars and he tried to find another party to go to so that I wouldn’t have to sit home and be bored. He couldn’t but we got to write a lot anyway. The next day I was going to a huge party in a city near mine. At first I went to work then when I got off I had pizza with 3 guys I know. The two of them came to my house later on the evening where we had some beer before we drove to the party. Lars called me suddenly asking for a guy’s number. One of my friends had the number and I gave Lars it. I found out that Lars and some of his friends was kinda after this guy cuz he apparently had forced one of his friends little sister to give him a blowjob. I don’t like the guy they where after so I didn’t mind, besides then I hate guys that does something like that. But that’s not my point, my point is that Lars and me again got to talk. He had prolly heard all the guys around me, cuz he suddenly wrote that he missed me and that he wished we could have something again. We called each other a couple of times that evening, but I didn’t make it deffenatly that I wanted to be with him again. I told him that I was to unsure weather he was serious or just wanted to be with me and then afterwards brake up a couple of days later… Again at this party I ended up kissing the same guy as the party last Wednesday. I know that he has totally fallen for me, but the problem is that his best friend still likes me a lot. And besides that, the one guy that my best friend is stuck on totally has fallen for me... How can I be so cursed?! My best friend got so depressed over this so she wanted to go home. This worked out perfectly for me, cuz that way I could get to the party Lars was at. He had invited me home to sleep over. I meet up with him and he called his dad to come pick us up. We sad down on a bench and started talking about us mostly. He kept telling me that he really missed me and that he wished we could try again. He also said that he had been thinking a lot about me, and that no matter what he did, then I kept popping into his thoughts. He also said what we would have to do different this time. One of the things was that we would have to go to more parties together, cuz he gets really jealous when I’m with all my guy friends at those big parties ( and you can say that he has a good reason, man! If he knew!)  Sitting there next to him on a bench when it’s dark, made me want to be with him so much, but my mind kept saying no. Keep it physical! When we got to his house we sad down and saw a movie and talked more about us. If I have to be honest then I feel like I can tell him everything and no matter what I say then we both have the same opinion on things and we like the same things. We are so alike in every way. Today I feel like he is my best friend and more. It scares me a bit knowing this, cuz I keep hearing that the kind of relationship that feels like this is often the once that last forever… not nice knowing that I could end up marrying this guy and never try being with anyone else. I have barely tried living, since I’ve been kinda hiding from the world the last two years. To make it short, then me and Lars are kinda back together. We aren’t a couple, but we are not allowed to have anyone else and we kiss and hug when ever we are together and we party together. But we don’t go to each others house every day or say to anyone that we are a couple. I don’t know what you can cal us… But I’m willing to go slowly on his premises cuz I like him so much, but it’s gonna be hard with this other guy that I’m flirting with so much. I could end up falling for him… so Lars I beg you to hurry, but then again you can’t force you’re self to be ready. I know that you only started this relationship last Friday, cuz you knew that I was slipping away.  I know that it’s wrong, but I’m not gonna stop flirting with this guy until we are serious again… cuz If you should brake it off then I want to have an emergency plan so I wont end up hurting myself or worse…  At home things are finally getting to the point where I can live and breathe in this house. My rents are being really nice to me, and my brother has forgiven me for letting him down, and we are brother and sister again… thanks for understanding me!

       I hate being out of control but I love it at the same time.   I was at a big party yesterday. At first I had had my class at my house for a barbeque. I don’t have to say it was really boring and that I’m not much into these gathering. It was really windy and we could hardly grill. After the BBQ I had to go to work. We had a huge sail so my boss needed me for a couple of hours. I got home again around 7 and a friend came over and we got ready for the party. I kept asking her if I looked all right and if she thought I was pretty today. She told me that I always look beautiful. There is a part of me who knows that I’m fairly pretty, but another part still thinks that I’m ugly, fat and evil. When we got to the party around 9 everyone was already there and had started to drink. I said hallo to all my friends (which is everyone there) the next thing on my mind was to go buy a drink and drink it fast so I could get real drunk. I wanted to get drunk and forget. Forget everything and everyone. When I’m drunk I become a different Maria. I flirt and I forget all my principles and most important of all, I forget my hart. I have no ties and no rules. All of this led to me getting the boy my best friend is in love with, to fall for me. She got really sad and ended up crying, but she has forgiven me, cuz it really isn’t my fault. I also ended up kissing a guy from my class who I think never has kissed a girl like that before. He is probably the best looking in my year, but he doesn’t seem like my type. I don’t want it to go anywhere, but we can’t avoid it changing anything. I can’t help feeling like I’ve been cheating on Lars, which is really weird since we’re not a couple. I keep thinking that I can never tell him cuz he’ll be hurt, like I’m hurting when I hear that he is seeing a movie with another girl.  At the party I was even so bold as to walking with all my scars visible. They aren’t that easy to see, but I knew some girls noticed and talked about them, but I didn’t care. I’m still kinda proud of them. They are my proof of that I’ve survived worse times then any of those girls together.  What can I say, I get what I want and ppl don’t know where they got me. I’m evil cuz I only serve my own causes. I don’t follow black and white rules. To me the only thing that matters is that I get what I want. Therefore you must understand that it is really weird for me that I care for someone above myself. That I’m willing to be hurt to keep this person from being it…  Please don’t forget me…

      I can’t tell you that me and Lars is back at the point we were before everything went wrong, but we are friends again. As some of you know he was at a female friend to watch a movie last Sunday. He stayed over night. I have never been so jealous, but I began writing with him anyway. We began talking about what went wrong that day, and he admitted that before it did, he was actually considering “us”. It makes me happy to know. I’ve been thinking about our past these last couple of days, and I can’t help but feeling like we’ve known each other for years even though it’s only around 3 months. I feel like we’ve gone through so much and somehow managed to stay such good friends. That must mean something…?  For some reason I’ve been listening a lot to the song breaking the habit by linkin park. The video and lyric is really powerful and I can relate to almost everything, especially when a young girl writes on a peace of paper that she is nothing and then cut’s herself and then cover the text with her blood.  Lately I’ve been in a funny mood too. I’ve been really happy on the surface. I can’t explain why and I can’t help looking like it. But somewhere under the surface I can feel how the thought of Lars and me being “separated” when we were so close to the goal.

      Can you forgive me again?  Last friday as you could read I was really depressed. It ended up with me calling Lars. I don't know why really, I guess I just wanted help and he was the last option. For some reason he got kinda upset bcuz I brought his mood down and ruined his party. Well thank you! After I had talked to him twice I got so angry with both him and me, that I went to my room and swollowed 15 panodil. I got a little dizzy and tired, but nothing else really happened. I just wanted to be numb, and if I got lucky they would kill me in my sleep. Ofcourse there wasn't enough to do that... But I hoped  I fell a sleep but woke up again bcuz my phone rang. It was Lars, asking if we were still fiends and how I was doing. I just told him I was ok now, well knowing that I had been really close to taking my own life. He joked about something and I couldn't help laughing. I promised I would call him the next day so we could talk this through. I did call him the next morning, but he didn't want to talk about it. I could hear on his voice that he still blamed me, and he even said that he wouldn't take his phone with him to partys so I couldn't depend on him...! Ever since I haven't heard from him. I'm better now, feeling good and no longer depressed, but I'm sad to have lost one of my best friends  I hate myself!!  Every time the thought pops into my head it feels like a thousand daggers being stabed into my chest. Crushing my hart over and over again. I caused this pain. Not only on my self, but on Lars as well... I'm sorry! Can you forgive me?

       The abyss   I'm standing in front of a dark edge. Cold wind blows up in my face from the bottom. I slowly lean out to see what draws me so hard towards it, wanting to jump out and let go. The abyss is so deep that I would fall forever and disappear from time and present. My life would end painless  As you can see I'm not doing to well. My life hangs by a thread. I'm the one who is worthless and sleeps through everything. I no longer take part in the world around me. I donÂt watch TV or reads the news or anything. Nothing cares to me I hate the thought of having to hurt all those ppl who cares, but I know they'll get over it and move on in their life. BUT GOD! Sleeping through youÂre life and not wanting to see what comes next, is so stupid, it only means that I no longer want the life my parents gave to me. So why keep me in agony?  If you all really care about me, then you would want me to do what is best for me  Food dosn't interest me. Nothing seems tempting, but i'm still eating something to keep my parents of my back. Yesterday I went to the doctor to get "the pill" just to make things easyer. He had to ask me a couple of medical questions, but then all the sudden out of no-where came this question: Are you depressed? I panikked, but kept my cold expresion on my face and said no! I lied as I always do... It may sound as a no biggie, but I actualty said no to get help. At that point there is no chance of me ever getting medical help in this.  At home everything is like it always is. I'm fighting with my mum and dad. They say I'M worthless and stupid and I say that I don't want to be a part of this family and stays in my room for as long as possible.  Only when I'm laying asleep on my coach, all my trubles seems so fare away.  I was surposed to go out to mc Donals with Lars today. He called me at 2 am yesterday and said that we where going out for dinner to get my mood up, but then he got in a fight later on the evening and broke his hand to places and now he can't drive... Yeah.. we didn't go bcuz of that... I'm a bit sad and I cut again, only on my arm, but the urdge to cut my wrist was really big... I tryed writting to Lars and ask him if he would hate me for it, but he didn't write back...  I hate myself for ruining my else what perfect life, or the perfect life it could have been. I'm all ready falling...

       I did it!   I cut today. Just after dinner the urge became to strong. I had been thinking a lot about it for several days now. Even a picture of a cut could make me grab the nearest scissor and make me cares my skin. So fare all the scissors have been to blunt.  I’ve been feeling more and more miserable every day. Even though nothing is really wrong in my life, but maybe that’s the real reason why I did it. Nothing in my life is too miserable or to good to stay for, besides I hate my look at the moment. I have no confidence in my self what so ever.  Anyway I cut and I’m sorry all of you who I promised not to, but most of you don’t really know how hard it is. “Luckily” I didn’t cut more then one cut and not very deep. I didn’t even cry afterwards as I mostly do, I just stood there silent and numb. It didn’t even hurt that much. I’m not gonna tell Lars that I did it, cuz he seems like he’s got enough to worry about, besides I don’t think he really wanna know.  Oh! And then I’ve finished one of my poems. Here it is:   Jekyll and Hide   I count the minutes Listen to my heartbeats I stare in the mirror for hours Trying not to forget  When dawn comes She’ll take over I fear her But I’m not strong enough to resist  I hide in her shadow at day Only at night I’m free Scared of what she might do Because I’m the one who pays the price  I look at her life through my eyes Seeing how she hurts the ones I love She’s cold and hard as rock Nothing is to sacred to be her tool   Hope you all like it. I think it’s one of my best so far… take care

      I'm gaining weight like never before. I'm already back up to the 65 kg :´( I'd so wish I could develop bulimia or anorexia, but the problem is that I can't stop eating and I can't throw up!! I'm afraid to go near the kitchen, cuz every time I do, I get to tempted and start eating something. Lukey we don't have any sweet stuff or cake in the house at the time. I gotta get this thing under controle so I can start loosing weight for summer...  Otherwise my life sux in everyway. All my friends are to busy to hang out or shop with me. I feel so alone in a way, but then again I don't really wanna hang with them. I'm busy enough with our examin and my mom bossing me around over this konfirmation. But then again she did gave me 400 kr! It dosn't mean that I forgive her so she keeps making demands for it. I really need the money, so I'm prissoned by it. I'm her slave :(...  I think about cutting every day now. It is becoming harder not to cut. I keep thinking: "no one will know" or "What's gonna happend if you don't" For some reason I think that my starting to eat again is bcuz I have no other alternative, and I'd rather cut then being fat!!!

       Okey here goes   I've been thinking a lot these past...well...24 hours, and I've come to this conclusion:  I'm sourrounded by brilliant ppl. I have 4 really great friends. They are always there for me to make me happy and keep me standing up. They love me no matter how screwed up I am and no matter how cranky and rejectable I can seem. I think that the only reason I have survived so fare is bcuz of them. I oow them so much and I'll do what ever I canto help them when I'm strong enough. Friends are the ppl you can relie on no matter what. They will never leave you and the love for them will never fade away.  I can live without a bfriend nad parents, but not without my precious friends.  Love you forever  *hugs*  ~maria

       I'm sitting here and waiting   First I want to appologise to those who have noticed that I've been alittle distant lately. I just can't seem to fokuse. I know that if I stretch it to fare then you'll get sick of me and leave me be, but please know that, that isn't what i want.  I'm just sitting here waiting to get the last message from lars before he flyes of to ibiza... I  talked to my boss today, and he said that since I meet lars I have changed a lot. He was the one who introduced us so I talk to him about lars, but now he says that he wish he didn't. I have changed so much from the girl I used to be. I'm unfokused and I drink a lot more and party a lot more. I forget my things and promises to ppl. He even says some of the regular costumers has been making hints to him that they can feel it too. He says I'm no longer as dedicated to my job and to making a good job. It was hard hearing this since he is like a father to me, but I know it's the truth. Lars has changed me a lot but not only him. All my issues has grown and I can no longer hide them as well from the world around me.  What can I do?!  Besiedes that then I'm really popular. I get 100 messeges a day from ppl that want's to hang out with me or just want to hear what I'm doing. I no it is all fake wanna-bees. It's the popular group and the persons that are most arrogant. I said yes to em all so I would have something to make this week pass faster...  stupid i know, cuz I get depressed from pretending for too long. I forget who i am and get fustrated that I can't just be me!  ~maria

       YAY! and not so good   Somehow me and lars got to talk again yesterday. I guess the luring sex part helped a lot. I just have to face it... men will do a lot for it!  First I tryed testing him and see what he would do if I offered a one night stand. At first it seemed as if he was up for it (wich is not good, cuz that would meen he only want me for that) But then he started asking if that wouldn't cause any confused feelings. I wrote back as if It wouldn't change my feelings, but that I also wanted it happen and no ties afterwards. I was so surpriced when I got the message that he didn't want to cuz he was looking for a girlfriend. He did the right thing! :)  We then came to the descision that we were gonna have a date when he get's home from ibiza (he is leaving today :(   )  I'm not so happy about it, but if he's together with some girl down there and it dosn't mean anything afterwards, then I really don't have so much against that, but I'm just afraid that It will change things... What am I saying?! ofcourse it means something if he is with some girl, cuz that would mean he isn't true in some weird twisted way. Even though we arent together, then it's like we have this agreement not to move on before we are both set free from each other...  I haven't set him free till I'm with some other boy cuz he was the one who broke of. But now that we have both agreed to try starting things up again when he comes back, then neither of us can set each other free untill we have had that date.  ...But then again, he can taire  himself free by being together with some girl on ibiza  ...on the other hand, then I know him well enough to know he's not the type that does something like that, and I trust him... lets just see what happends  It's gonna be a long 7 days. he is first home at noone wednesday :( meanwhile I have to find something to do besiedes working to get my mind of things. If you think too much about what could happen, then you start having these creapy illusions. I've tryed that a little too much with him, and it can really ruin things in a second!  There is though some part of me that isn't sure if it's smart getting back together with him, since I will end up getting hurt. I'm only drawing the enevedable out... I know for a fact that he isn't gonna be the one I'm gonna spend my life with, so It's gotta come at some point. I'm almost past the painfull part of our brake-up and getting involved again could only make it worse. But I like him so much so I'm willing to take the risk and take the pain once more. Who knowes, maybe I'll be strong enough to take it then :) I have to be at least possitive.  ~maria~

      I was really down earlyer today. I guess it was bcuz My rents where after me again. I felt the whole emptyness from not knowing where to go from now. I'm single havbe no parents and I have no dreams. I have to find something to replace all these gaps now...  It's a risky chance to take and I know from experience that I'll chose the wrong one. I have tendensy to chose the old and safe like lars, and my parents, but sometimes that isn't the best choice. I have to try and move on. try fighting my way out of this. otherwise I might as well give it all up.  goodnight  *hugs*

      I'm back home  The trip made me grow a bit. I had lots of time to think over things and get everything on a distance. I didn't throw up on the trip cuz I couldn't get enough time and after I tryed there came a little blod up so I had to stop.  Thuesday I had descided to go get a piercing in my belly. I went to a salon in town and got an appoitment. I wasn't really nervous cuz Im' used to the pain. I was not even a bit worried about that my mum would throw me out if she found out. I hate her - fuck her. Shes not the boss of me! my body my rules right ? :)  I was so close to hitting my mum on the trip after she started talking about my cutting infront of my littlebrother almost everyday. Both my rents make me sick just looking at them. I have no feelings for them - well only hate... I think I'm gonna stop calling them mum and dad and start adressing them by their first name.  Now that I'm home again I'm gonna party and try finding a replacement for lars, cuz I need someone there to keep me strong now that I'm pretty much on my own...  I'll write back later

      This is my last post before I leave - I promis ;)  Today I tryed starving myself after I had watched a movie about bulimia. I thought to myself how the hell does she do it?! how can she throw the food up so easaly. I wish I could do it, well I'll just have to work on it. The movie gave me some pretty good tips. MY starving promis ended up in me binging once at work while my boss was out of the store. I went to the toilet and tryed to stick two fingers in my throath, but it only resoulted in my caufing and my eyes running in water. I was close, but then my bos came back and I had to stop. I wanna be thin and lose 6 kg or more if it's possible.  I know that I promis a lot of things, but you don't know how hard it is to keep those promises when you can't even keep the once you make with youre self...  I've packed my bags now and I'm ready to go... I wanna go now. I think it could be good for me to get it all in a distance and try seing different sides of the world. Maybe I'll find what I need out there. Maybe I'll bring back hope and joy - who knows...?  I'll come back changed any way - just a little bit older and hopefully wiser ;)

       This is my last day...   On saturday I'll go to mallorca wiht my family. I'm so scared of what may happen. I sleep all day and I feel week cuz the day where I have to leave you all is nearing so fast. Once I'm there I'll have no one to help me when I'm weak. I know that I'm so posed too look forward to go to a southern contry, but I fear how life will change while I'm gone. Will you remember me? If I don't soon get an answar from LArs about where we stand, then I know he is gonna forget me while I'm gone... My mum wants me to pack tonight, but I can't get myself to do it. It will be the same as saying that now it's over, now I'm leaving you all for a week. The most important thing I can pack now is my razor blade, pills and my music so I can shut my mums voice out of my head.  I hate her!   While I'm down there I'll get as much sun as possible and I'll hopefully lose a little weight. Tomorrow I'll only have the morning before I have to go to work and after work I have to go to a little party with somefriends to get me drunk before I leave.  I'm gonna miss you all so much to talk to... hope I can get to the computer again before I finally leave for the airport.  If not... Then I want you all to know that I'm gonna try surviving spending a week with my rents wihtout any ways to avoid them!  goodbye...

       Is there no one?!   Yesterday I asked my father for help against my mum. I almost got down on my knees and begged for him to see things my way and agree that she is not treating my right, but instead of his understanding and comford, he just said that it was mine and my mum's battle...!  He wont help me! He is too loyal towords my mum to help his own daugther who needs his help more than ever.  Well that was it. I can just as well give up and stop fighting. From now on my mum can do with me what ever she wants. I'll dissapear and bcome an empty shell to the world...  another thing is - I've descided to write a message to lars that goes like this: is it just me who misses us like we were? I know something happened that schouldn't happen, but this is too hard! I kepp feeling like we gave up to easy...  There is no one can say that I'm not fighting for our relationship. It's the only thing now that still has a small hope, now that I'm no longer is alive at home.

       Lost without you...   I've been writting sms'es with LArs now. I can read between the lines that he is angry cuz it ended. I really think he liked me and thought that it was gonna last a long time. If i'm lucky and play my cards right, then he'll forgive me and we can be friends again.   an hour before this:  I went to his work to get some movies that I had left at his house. When I got there he wasn't working alone. I didn't really think I could start talking about our shit in front of the other person. When I went to the counter he just asked me what I wanted! I said my movies in a low voice. He nodded and said that he was sorry but he had forgotten them. I chooked my head and went to the fridge to get an Ice tea. When I wanted to pay for it he just treated me like an annonomes customer. I could feel the cold tensetions among us, but maybe he just acted like this, bcuz he still felt hurted and bcuz the other person was there. When I got home he wrote that he was sorry he forgot and if he schould bring it by my boss tomorrow.  I can sence in his words that he didn't wanted this to end yet, but he ofcourse was too hurt to stay with me...  I'm truly sorry Lars and I really wish that some of you're pain would go into me when I cut

      My dad came to my room, I guess after orders from my mom. He asked me some ordinary questions, as if nothing had happened. I could feel the cold silence and all his questions floating around in the air. He normally dosn't come to my room like that. All the sudden called my mom that dinner was ready. I could hear how relieafted my father was. He clearly didn't want to bring the subject up. When we came downstairs my dad asked me if I didn't feel varm with all that clothes on. Before I could answar him, replaied my mum that it was bcuz I had to cover my wrists. I hate her so deeply now. When I listen to how she talks to everyone, and see how mean she is, I get a huge urdge to hit her or start shouting that all of this is her fault! She reminds me of a cruel teenage girl, who talk behind others back and constantly reminds them of THEIR mistakes and errors. Nothing is good enough for her. I'm so ashamed of her sometimes. My gratest fear is that I one day will become like her

       today I feel the pain...   It feels as if a big part of me is missing. The pain I so desperatly craved for has finally come. Everytime I think of him, my mom or my life a huge pain strikes up my chest. My mom saw my cuts last night when she came to my room to check on me. She has been questioning me all morning. She yells at me all the time. She wont leave me alone. She threathens me with sending me away to a psyciatrical hospital or a foster family. She demands to hear why I do it. In her eyes it's a disease that needs a cure. SHe said that I'm mentaly ill for doing something like that. Why wont she understand that I wont talk to her?!  She says she is getting me a doctors appoitment next week. I don't really care, she can do what ever she wants. I'm not talking to anyone I don't want to.  I feel so helpless and alone now. Even though there is so many there for me, then they can't help me here at home. I want out!

       Today I cut, so tomorrow I shall do it again...   Lars broke up with me today. I don't want to get  into details since they are not important. What's important is that he now proved to me that his affection was fake. Like everything around me, ever since I was born, he was fake. My world collapsed. My last hope in the human race is now gone. I don't believe in love anymore. NO man can ever care enough for me, with a sutch unselfish passion, that he can save me from my destany. I have I way with hurting myself before hurting the once I love. I guess I'm too weak that way, and it's gonna be my doom someday.  I'm so tirate of being play around like that. Life is though on me, but wheater it's just a random coinsidence or ment to be, I don't know. I just know that I'm sick of it all. I hate having to wait around another day, hoping for something to come by that might awake my passion in life again. I can still laft, but how long till that thing is gone? How long till I'm dead inside? I'd rather die then let that happen!  Strangely it is as if I allready did died that evening he left out of my life. I didn't feel the same old sorrow as I've felt before with him. I knew this was comming. I had already cut before he left. I was already dead inside... there is almost nothing left but an empty shell.  Funny thing wiht us suiciders. We are typically the most stunning and beautiful creatures to others. We facinate others and sometimes draw them down to hell wiht us. I don't want to do that to any of my loved ones. I want them in a safe distance from me, so don't be mad if I push you away. I just don't want others to be hurt and see he world with my eyes. Cuz once you're there then there is no going back..

       The day after tomorrow...   Lars hasn't answered my SMS and he hasn't written anything to me all day. I knew he was gonna be busy today, but when I got up I could see that he had log on to the internet before he left home, so he must have read the mail.  I'll post the letter so you can see what I'm so concerned by:  I’m sending this to you the day before you get you’re hat on. It took me about 2 hours to write this, and I’m now putting the final touches to it at 2 o’ clock. There is so much I want you to know. I know this sounds odd, especially since we have only known each other for 4 months (since 2 march to be exact) and we’ve been a couple for 1 month here on Friday.  I just want you to know that you’re really special, we are so alike. You make me smile when no one else can. You make my heart beat faster when I look at you.  I love lying next to you when you sleep. You always keep me so close into you, and smile when I kiss you in your sleep. I listen to you’re breath for hours before I fall asleep. Even though I normally sleep a long time like you, then I can’t when you’re there next to me, cuz I’m anxious to wake up and spend time with you. Now I feel like you’re slipping away from me. I’ve tried this 3 times before with you, so I should have the practice, but this time it hurts more than ever. I just want you to know this, before it’s too late… I would have preferred to tell you this when I was lying in you’re arms, but I don’t know if that situation ever comes again… I know I’m not anything like your xs’es and that you prolly don’t like me just as much as any of them. I often wonder how I ever can live up to them. I’m weird and have a hard past. This is all something that comes with me. Something that you have to live with, but with you it’s like all my worries goes away. I stopped cutting and found a will to live again. I’m not saying that I’ll kill myself if you leave me, but I’ll miss a big support in my life. You have really changed me in so many ways.  I thought I knew all there was to know about living, but I was wrong! You accepted me the way I was, but I wanted to change and look the best for you. I didn’t feel good enough, standing there next to you, when you introduced me to everyone. You deserve a supermodel, which can spend every second with you. I just want you to know that I don’t want to loose you yet, I’m not ready, and if you have to leave me… please make me hate you first, so it won’t hurt so much this time… You should know by now that I hate these kind of soft letters. I always saw people that wrote them, as being soft cowards who didn’t have the guts to tell it face to face, but here I am writing one of my own.  There is nothing more woundable, then doing something like this, but I feel like it’s the only way I’ll ever get these things said to you. I’m so scared of what you’re reaction might be. I can imagine that at first you’ll be kinda chocked and can’t really believe that it is me writing something like this.  He he I wish I could see your face as you reed it, but then again I would be too scared… The rest is up to you, but I hope we stay together…                                                              Maria   Btw don’t ask why I wrote this in English ;o)

      BTW then I finally got a poem done that I wrote specially for Lars, and he saw it yesterday, but don't think he understands it. here it is:  Like bubbles in a full Champagne glass, Rushes the feeling up through my veins Brings life to every fiber of my body  My hand caresses the thorns, With a graceful move. White and red joins in a game of life and death  A pearl reflects the sun, the moon and the stars You’re words, the music and the scent, Lingers in my heart, creating a hole  The look in the fading rose, Wanting to make the world understand And fade out into the cold nothing  But kept warm by you...

      I think that LArs is gonna brake up again. These last couple of days has been very stressing for both of us. Me thinking I was pregnant (I know I'm not now) and him getting his final examns ready. We just haven't had the time to be together. Now I know that he has been thinking about us, and it really sounds like the times when he wanted to brake up.  I'm so depressed so I cut my wrist. This time it got so deep that I hit a small vain and it bleed for a long time and it bled a lot! When it had seemed to stop, it put a bandage around it and wrote a letter to lars, that I wnat him to read before he brakes up. It's a kinda risky letter that tells him all the things I was so afraid to say, but if I'm gonna loose him I might as well take the chance...  I'll tell you if I collect enough guts and actually e-mail it to him... until then goodbye everyone

       Showing my true self   Today when I got home, my mum and ad really pissed me off. Both of them where giving me unreasonable demands, so I got mad and yelled with the top of my lungs (and I don't have a weak voice) I sweared and yelled all kinds of names at them. My dad wanted me to mouve the lawn (take 1½ hour) and my mum wanted me to vacume downstairs. I had just got home from work, so I really needed to sit down and relax. Aperantly, my rents didn't see it that way. I ended up vacuming, while still yelling at them, and finally went outside to get the lawnmouver. I kept driving my mood up. Finally I couldn't keep it in anymore. All my supressed anger came to the surface. All the anger I have against Lars, my friends, my rents, my boss, my teachers and my self, got me to kick things around throwing my dad's stuff on the hard sement floor. I broke a couple of his things, but nothing I couldn't repair afterwards, so he dosn't know.  I really felt good afterwards. I guess I needed this outburst and the relieave my self. This whole anger thing is not new to me. I've tryed this a couple of times before. It has just not been this big in a couple of years. I really got tempor ;P  Over and out!

      I'm miserable and I wanna cut. Nothing make cense, cuz suddenly there's a lot of ppl that wants to hang out with me. All the sudden I'm popular, without I've done anything paticular. If I don't soon get rid of this pain and fear that still rest in every fiber of my body, then I'll cut. I can't live with it, feeling my hart beat faster when I get scared. Not having anyone to hold and feel the comforting touch of. I know Lars is supposed to do this, but he feels so distant - The world feels distant...  Don't be mad at me if I brake down, don't be mad if I loose control and gives in to the urdge.  I'm merely a girl, who has gone through too much shit, so even though you don't understand my choice, then trust my judgment to make the right choices for both me and my loved ones.  *hugs*

      I'm so afraid now  My period is late almost by two weeks. I feel like I have to trhough up sometimes and my breast are sore. Besiedes then I'm more moody than ever. Yeah you have prolly guessed it... I'm afraid that I'm pregnant. Even though we have never really done it without protection then there has been a couple of times where it could have gone wrong. My mom is even asking me if i'm not really late. normally there only goes 21 days between a period, but I'm over 31 now...!  I haven't really told Lars, but he knows that I'm late and I've told him about the nausia, but he hasn't really been asking into it. I don't know how much more I can stand waiting. I feel like I'm waiting for my own doom. The more time that passes the worse. I need someone to talk to about this, but who? there is not a lot of persons that I can talk to about this. surtanly not my rents!  I'm scared :´(

      And she is back…!  I hate my mom at the moment (as usual) This time it’s cuz she keeps trying to make me feel really guilty. She has caught me lying twice today. I’m losing my touch on lying. Maybe cuz I’m so distracted by other things at the moment. Even though it’s small things I lied about, then she called me three times while I was with Lars. I hadn’t told Lars the second reason, cuz it was kinda bcuz of him I lied, and I don’t want him to fell guilty. The third time she call, Lars was sleeping and didn’t hear the convocation (thank god) after my mum hang up I started crying and laid my head on Lars’s stomach. He woke up and asked me what was wrong. I told him that she constantly tried to make me feel so guilty and that she was disappointed in me. He hugged me and held my head into him. At that point I hated myself for all those lies I had got rolled up in. I feel like I can’t move, and that I’m trapped in a spider’s web of lies. Ever since I met Lars, the lies have turned against me, and have become my enemy instead of my best friend. I can sense the changes that this whole thing is causing on me. I’m being forced to change, forced to be happy. It is so hard to get there, having to fight back trough thorns and the hard wilder of emotions and old feelings.  Why is it so hard to grow up, when I thought I already had a long time ago?   This is dedicated to Lars:  I can’t breathe At first I had gels But then I met you You took me to the surface I loved it and grew lungs to stay with you  Then my world fell down Lost you’re will to try I could no longer stay with you So I had to return to the sea But I didn’t fit in there anymore  I can’t breathe I’m dying slowly Reaching out for you If you don’t help… Then I’ll drown  ________________   I read this to him one morning, when he had hangovers and was sleeping next to me. I think he knows that it is about him. One day Lars I’m gonna write a real poem just for you.  One that’s gonna be my best, may it be sad or happy, I don’t care.

       My new ways...?    &nbsp; Okey then.. how to put this right? This week has been increadible. I went to the summercap with lars wednesday. Apperearently Lars missed me incredible much, his dad even told me that he hadn't had eny thing but me on his mind thuesday. Anyway, when I got there the first thing we did was take a walk down to the beach. We had so much fun and later on the evening we reanted a movie and watch it with his family. I feel so at home in his family. I can talk to both his parents so easaly. Later on the evening when we where about to go to sleep, we started talking and he told me that he thaught he was starting to fall in love with me, and that he was scared cuz he had promised himself that he wouldn't do that again cuz he always ended up hurt. I didn't know what to do, the whole thing came as a chock. I wanted to tell him that I love him, but I'm not sure I mean it, or if&nbsp;it was just some cheesy clishé that came as a reflex to his words. I just kissed him deeply and sayed that I would hurt myself before hurting him. The next day, we went bading and one of lars's friends came up to the cap. We played a badminton tournament. We basicly had so much fun and I got a little closer to his friend. Later we went fishing and after that to a greek restaurent. We even had an icecream afterwards, I was pretty full of myself. But still for somereason I got a major depression later on the evening. I wanted to talk to lars about it, but how can I tell him that I can get depressed now that I'm serposed to be happy that we have such a great time?! I think I got the depression because I know that I'm falling in love with him too, and that makes me scared just like him. He has broken my heart so many times. I just pretended that it was my heart I had problems with... and it is in way... I faked pain and setted my breathing up. I so wanted him to know something was wrong, but I didn't want him to fell like the blame, so this was the only way out. I cant keep all this pain locked up, so this was my only resort, cuz like I promised him, then I'd rather hurt before I hurt him. he got really consurned and did whatever he could to keep me comfortable. Only problem is that he now wants me to go to a doctor... I&nbsp;hated myself fro what&nbsp;I&nbsp;was doing&nbsp;to him, and that I couldn't just be happy that things&nbsp;were going so great!  I got home friday and went streigth to work. After work I held a small party in my house. At first we where about 9 ppl. Later on the party was really going great, so lars came over with 3 friends. When he first came the first thing he did was to tell me how much he had missed me, and he then dragged me a little away to tell me something. He wanted to tell me that he had hit a guy who had held a knife to one of his friends throat, and that he hoped I could understand that he had had to do that. I know he come from that enviroment, and that he cant really get free of it comepletely. Bescides, then I'm not fussy about those things so I was just glad nothing happende to him. We then dissed&nbsp;my party and went outside. lars told me that I looked really greate tonight and that he really felt proud that I was HIS when he came to this party.&nbsp;Again he showed those signs that he is really falling in love with&nbsp;me.&nbsp; What am I gonna do..?! I got to find out what I'm feeling so that i can tell him the truth. Lars went to sleep at 4 in my parents bed, but I had to stay up and watch the party. It didn't end till 6 and then I started cleaning the house, cuz me parents would come home the next day, or schould I say that day! I wasn't done till 8. I then made lars some food and went up to the bed with it, but he was to tirated to eat. He fell asleep beside him. I woke up again by the sound of my dog barking cuz a car was comeing. I woke lars up, cuz I thought it was my parents. I had never seen him get up so fast. I had only slept 4 hours, but it turned out to be my grandmother that drove right away again. since we where already up, then we drove over to his house on his scooter. One of his friends called and asked if we wanted to go to macD with him and another friend. We came along and it was a really fun trip. Afterwards we just drove around, drank beer and lafted at some jokes. We ended up at a city festival, where I meet some of my family. After that we wnet to a state fare, where lars shot down a couple of flowers for me "again" The trip was so greate. We had so much fun and I really got closer to his friends. 4 hours later me and lars where sitting and watching tv in his living room. That was about what we did together that day, but before I went home, he took me out in his garden where we ate some cherrys. He even picked some for my mum, cuz I told him she loves them. We again talk a little about us. I menchoned how I think it's great that we can spend so much time together without getting tirate of eachother. I can't even do that with my best friend.  I then got picked up by my mum, sat down saw a movie and now here at 23 o' clock I'm sitting and writting this. I have only had 4 hours sleep in 24 hours, and tose 24 hours include a pretty broken body, bcuz of the rough night where I was depress and a badminton tournament, working, holding a party, taking care of lars, cleaning and hanging out with his friends an entire day. So I'm pretty tirate now. I think I'm gonna sleep 12 hours if my mum will let me ( wich I doubt).  goodnight to you all   ~maria~   &nbsp;

       quiet pease     &nbsp;  Lars called me yesterday and asked me if I wanted to come up to the summercap with his rents. I drove with them up there and I got to talk a little with them. They are ok, they seem like a happy family...  When we got there I "ofcorse" showed mysself from my best side and helped them as much as I could. The weather was great so we descided to go down to the beach and swim. WHat can I say... it all seemed so... i don't know... HAPPY!  We swam for an hour, then me and lars went back and his rents stayed to collect seashells. Back home we saw some movies while trying to get our bodyheat back. At dinner we grilled and had a HUGE meal. We grilled marshmellows and biscuits. Afterwards lars and his kid brother chased each other with waterguns. WE played some tennis and dart. I then did the dishes wiht his rents (I normally hate that, but I wanted to show a good side of myself) We saw two movies then we all went to bed. Lars and me slept in a camping trailer. Later at night it started raining and thundering. I thought it was kinda coasy, so we just layed there and talked. We came around to the subject about my mother. I tryed to explain to him how my relationship is with her, but he couldn't relate. He has such a perfect family so he has hardly tryed it... Well okey good for him.  &nbsp;  Th next day we went to the dock and had some fish and chips. Lars got in a bit of a fight with his brother and I was sitting between them :S  Suddenly in the car, his brother asked me where the scars on my arm came from. Lars sendt him the look, but I just answard it was&nbsp;from a leaf collecter. One of those with all the sharp edges. He seemed to believe it, so now &nbsp;I don't think he'll ask me again...  &nbsp;  Otherwise things are great... I'm home alone (planing a small party)  It's nice not having to worry about my rents. I have to take care of myself now (comepletely) it's not new to me. Only having to buy my own food.  &nbsp;   maria

       I miss him!    &nbsp; I can't stand thinking about him, I feel so lonely and I miss him. I know it's perthetic since it's only been 2 days and there is one day left. but as this saying says:    "wind is to fire what distance is to love. It kills the weak and makes the strong stronger."   I guess this can only mean that I'm already to deep in this, to play it safe. If something schould happen now, then it will affect me no matter what...!' I so desperatly hope that it can hold this time. We make so many plans, and we try out so many things (like jealousi). I'm just a bit worried about what's gonna happen when I start back in school and I don't have all the time for him. My plan is to make him fall for me even more before that time comes... &nbsp; My mum and dad are packing the trailer tomorrow, but before that she wants me to go shopping with her. The only problem is that I don't have enough money to buy new clothes, but I'll go anyway to see if I can get some out of her. After all I&nbsp;never asked for much of her, and she do want me to make a good impression on people, so if I play my cards right... ;) &nbsp; Well I hope that he keeps his word and that I somehow can get away with going with him next week. So fare I can't tell... but I'll keep you updated &nbsp;   maria &nbsp;

       I'm trying to juggle my life...   I wont let my life stop completely. I'm hardly home now, cuz I'm either with lars or at work. We had a bit of a fight yesterday. His x had written something to him that I by an accident wread on his phone. She wrote this: "It's not nice having to sleep alone in this house bcuz it makes strange noises". This ofcourse sounded all wrong, but instead of waking him up and make him write something back, then I wrote this to her: "good thing that I don't have to sleep alone". hehe I know this was kinda mean, but I guees I was what you call jealous. He found out the next day, cuz she call him and started crying cuz he kept refuseing that he had wrote it (ofcouse) He then asked me if I had done it. I just told him the truth and all the sudden we were disgussing wheater she ment something by it. OKEY so she is afraid of being home alone, but for crying out loud she is 20!! and dosn't her boyfriend got a phone or some of her friends ?!?!?!  Even though he had to make friends with her again and excuse for my behavior, then he wasn't really mad at me, and he came over and we talked it out, and now it's in the past.   heheheh I'm evil ;)   he is now in a summercap with some friends (I couldnt come cuz I have to work) anyway, my boss says I can take the next week of, and lars has invited me up tp the sumemrcap with him and his rents. My mum and dad are going camping that week, and the only reason why I can stay home is cuz I said I had to work... I can't tell them yet that I can get of and that I'd rather go with lars, but I plan to call them when they are there and say I'm going with him a couple of days.  Damn it's hard having to juggel youre life like that to get what you want!   BTW sorry there goes so long between my posts, but I'm hardly home anymore ;) YAY!!!

       what is this?!   When ever I'm around my mother we argue. I try to stay out of the house as much as possible, but whenever I'm stuck here, she is constantly after me. I feel this huge hole in my heart. She threatens me to throw me out of the house. Even though I only act mad, then it really hurts. I cant look at her without wanting to hit her or start to cry...  It feels so empty and meaningless to try and make up with her... She dosn't love me. I'm only her maid... her slave...  I want to cut again. right now before I have to go down and eat a birthday dinner for her. I pray that I'll stay strong and not give up...

       imaginary   I linger in the doorway Of alarm clock screaming Monsters calling my name Let me stay Where the wind will whisper to me Where the raindrops As they're falling tell a story  If you need to leave the world you live in lay you're head down and stay a while though you may not remember dreaming Then something waits for you to breath again  In my field of paper flowers And candy clouds of lullaby  I lie inside myself for hours And watch my purple sky fly over me  Don't say I'm out of touch With this rampant chaos - your reality I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge The nightmare I built my own world to escape  Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming The Goddess of imaginary light

      " 2 days notice"   Sorry I havent been updating the blog these past 2 days, but i just haven't had the time.  I'll start catching up by telling about wednesday: I was supossed to had been in the cinema with mik, but then all the sudden lars wrote early in the morning that he was home now. Just the fact that I was one of the first persons he wrote to when he got home really told me that he hadn't forgotten me. We arranged to meet that evening so I had to cancel with mik, cuz I was afraid that if I posponed it, then he would change his mind. sadlt then he fell aslepp around 5 o clock and slept all night, since he hadnt slept for a long time. I was a little mad at him there, but I could understand him cuz I've tryed it myself and you are really tirated... I stayed up till 1 just hopeing that he might wake up and to get my thoughts straight. I was so close to give up on him then, cuz It was once out of a million times that something had come between us. Luckely  I didn't and the next morning we began to write again after he had apologized ofcourse ;) He wanted me to come down to one of his friends and get some beer. i invited a friend along and she came over at my house first where we had a couple of beers. OH! and I drank a can beer on 34 seconds - New record !! :D Well after I did that a couple of times I was already pretty drunk and so was my friend. Lars had promissed that he would write when we schould come, cuz we  had agreed to meet in this bar they where heading for, but then it started to rain :-/  We never made it over to the friend, but My dad drove me over to lars at 11 so we could watch that movie I had got for him and eat some popcorn. While we saw the movie we got to talk about us ofcourse... HE acctuatly told me that he had never tryed falling so fast for a girl he had just met, nor asking her home on their forst date(he means that he asked me home 5 days after we met) I can scence in some way that he really likes me, and thats why he can't really let go everytime we brake up. Me using all the info from my friend and the psykology things I had picked up from him, I pretty much got him convinced that all our "problems" could be salved together now. (just so you kow then the problem with us is that he is afraid to open to much up and love me completely cuz I'll be able to hurt him to much then) I think it sweet, but a bit hard for me to deal with, but I'm gonna try for his and mines sake. It's not like I'm in a hurry right :)  besiedes that then my dad saw my piercing yesterday while we where eating alone. I just thought that this was it, and that I had to take it out and get grounded for 3 years... but instead then he agreed with me that it was my body and that it was prolly best not to tell my mum... That was really surpricing to hear from him. I'm gratefull, but I still know that he will betray me if I upset him the least, so I have to be carefull for the next time period until he kinda has forgotten..  Well that was sort of what happened the last couple of days...  ¨maria

       Vampiristic   I once believed in vampires, but now I know that I saw it all wrong and I know what made them fascinated me.  They where abondonned to lonelyness cuz no human would ever understand and not fear them. Like "normal" ppl wont understand and fear the "disease" some like me carry. We dont drink blod like them, but we like the pain and are drawn to our own blood. Watching it dripp down from our selfinflicted cuts. Not being able to find rest at night, cuz we know that when dawn comes the pease will be gone and we have to put that mask back on. We can spend hours sitting in the dark enjoying the silence and the lonelyness. We mostly dont care if we hurt ppl and can seem careless of others feelings. What some might call evil, while others see our "good" side cuz we trust them not to hurt us. In so many way we remind so much of the fantasy figure called a vampire. who knows maybe Bram stoker was one of us and simply created a caracter that reflected himself when he wrote caunt dracula.  I know it sounds nuts, but some of us live so long in this lonyness, watching others life and living through them, so they evoulve a sort of skill that can read a persons thoughts by their actions. They can see the pain and frustration that other ppl so desperatly tryes to hide. It can make the insane having to deal with it and know when this person is faking its love towards them. They dont tell others that they have this abillity cuz "normal" ppl would denie it trying to hide their secrets. Some just dont tell cuz they dont want to confront more pain and missery.  If you believe this or not is totaly up to you... I wont force anyone to belive it, but I've written this to make you think about it...  ~maria

       I'm sick og you using me!   I know the truth I only think you schould know that... I saw you and I know when you lie cuz I can regonize a tool I use myself!... I know you can afford this, and that it dosn't toucth you to use others to get what YOU want...  Well I really dont care, but remember that everyone else has fealings too!! I'm sick of it and I dont need it in my life right now, so stay away unless you really want to know who I am with a non-selfish reason... hope you understand and learn from it, before it causes serious dammage to a person  maria

      I still get my days to go a little faster by hangingout with some friends or watching all my movies twice... I know it's sad, but what else can I do? inside i'm shivering and nervous about wednesday... I'm not afraid more like looking forward or happy about so the time goes incredible slow.  Today I almost fell asleep when ever I sat down on a chair. I gotta start getting some sleep at night. The only problem is that I can't sleep anymore. When I try it's like all my thoughts comes back to haunt me.  Another thing is that we have no food in the house at the moment. I guess that is good cuz then I dont get tempted, but it still bothers me not to have all the food around so I can look at it...or binge  ~maria

       I'm safe   Everything seems so clear now. I don't feel like i'm stombling around in the dark looking for the switch. Last night I saw this movie about a woman who gets forced to give birth to a child she got from a rape cuz the rapist held her prisoned till the law would protect the baby. I really like the movie cuz it was about how it's youre body youre rules... or well about how i schould be. The same goes for me... If i wanna destroy my future and my body, then that's my choice.  I also read my entire blog... Everyone of the post stod so clear for me as was I there again when I read them. I felt the sorrow and the joy I had felt back then. It gave me some perspektive to read it. I could overlook it all and I realized that I have changed so much those 5 months I've written my blog. I had to change to be able to be stronger and figt this thing, but along the road i have forgotten who I really was.  I saw myself changing...  Later on the night I went out to run. It had already gotten dark, but the moon made it all light up. everything gets a whole other apearence and it seems like the time stands still.  I descided to go in to my old kindergarten. I sat on a swing for a while, but nomatter where I looked I saw ghost of my past. All my forgotten memories were suddenly apearing in my mind. I saw my entire life that night. When I got back in the house I was still reminded of something from my past when ever i saw a peticular object that had something to do with them. My room was the hardest. So much has happened here. I've spent almost one fourth of my life in that room, and most of the bad and good things has happened in there. I know it must sound weird, but I was walking into my room and there was I in different times and situations. It seemed so real, but I knew it was a memory.  i still see it all today, but not as clear. Now I can just remeber everything again. I can remember myself...  ~maria

       Hallo everyone...   I don't know what to write today.. I'm so ashamed and sad. O nly a few days after I wrote how great it is to have friends, then I f*** it all up. I don't know if I'm testing you all or wheahter I'm simply just selfdestructive... I didn't feel so great yesterday... it all started 24 hours ago. I was really depressed and in a very bad mood cuz my rents and brother had been anoying me all day. They had been watching and kriticising me for everything I do. I tryed to go on msn to find someone there that could chear me up a bit. Jesper was online and I talked a bit with him, but I slowly realized that I was ruining his mood by being so depressed and that upseted me quite a bit so I told him that I had to go off before I pissed anyone off. It wasn't bcuz of you jesper I had just had a bad day so all my issues doing this week had started to bild up inside and it was getting too much...  Later on the evening it got worse. I don't know what had made the cup run over, but I found myself crying over the smallest things. I found some chokolate in the house (2 plates) I started binging in the one plate, but when I tryed to purged I failed. I was so sad that I had done this to myself and not being able to undo it. I always had this small hope that I could undo whatever mistake I made. I guess I took this as a sign for that I can't undo all the mistakes that I've been trying so hard to undo. It had become my life. Trying to ælive out the childhood I had missed. trying to get lars back. trying to make my parents love me. trying to make my body perfekt... I broke down and started screaming and throwing things around. I broke a small lamp that my brother had givin me and tipped my entire dvd collection down from the shelf. My brother suddenly started knocking on my door, wanting to borrow a new movie I had bought. I didn't feel that I could stand talking to anyone at that moment so I just turned up the musik. My father then came and banged on my door. He said that I schould turn down the musik and answar my brother. Meanwhile I was jsut sidding on my floor with my knees drawn up to my head. I cryed harder when my father started threatening me and my mother came to his assistense. I just couldn't take it anymore and I screamed. it became quiet for a while, but then they asked what was wrong... WHAT WAS WRONG?! huh I felt a huge urdge to go out there and shout directly to their face that I hated them and never wanted to see them again, but instead I just said that they schould leave me alone... after a while they did...  I later on fell a sleep on the floor after I had cut my upper arm four times. The blade was really blunt so it wasn't deep.  I'm sorry for everything that i said and did, but I was really out there and didn't know what to do... please forgive me

       Changes   I'm not supposed to be scared of anything But I don't know where I am I wish that I could move but I'm exhausted And nobody understands I'm tryin' hard to breathe now but there's no air in my lungs There’s no one here to talk to  And the pain inside is making me numb  I try to hold this, under control They can't help me 'Cause no one knows  Now I'm going through changes, changes God I feel so frustrated lately When I get suffocated save me Now I'm going through changes, changes  I'm feelin' weak and weary walkin' through this world alone Everything I say, every word of it, cuts me to the bone I've got something to say but now I got nowhere to turn It feels like I’ve been buried underneath all the weight of the world   (how I feel right now)  ~maria

       I did it again!     When i got home from lars, I was suddenly feeling really depressed. I have been carying worries about my mum, my life and all I've been through and today after seeing how great a family schould be, it just became to much. I went streight to my room and found the vault I keep my raizor blades in. I held t in my hand and looked at it for a while, wondering if it was worth it. I couldn't do it on my arm anymore, so i took my shirt off and started cutting rifts on my back. I made about 10 that looked like I had been scratching myself. I felt terrible cuz I can't hide them from lars. I wrote to lars that I had fainted and that my heart was beating really fast, wich was true except for the fainting. He told me to call someone right away. (I have had stress before, so it was prolly that) All the worries plus the new once about him finding out, had bcome too much. All in all we have been discusing wheather I schould get help or not, so he is forcing me to see a doctor with him.  What have I done!? The doctor is gonna wanting to listen to my chest and is gonna see the cuts. I've tryed to make lars understand that I wont go till next week, but then he asked me if I didn't care about the once who loves me... What am I gonna do?!  It feels like my heart is skipping a beat everytime I hear my parents voices, hear the phone ring or think about any of it. I think this is my bodys way of saying that I can't take it anymore. I have to take the fall, even if that means I'm gonna fall a long way...   ~maria

       I need to get this of my chest!     Today I have very mixed emotions. I'm extremly moody and everything and nothing pisses me off. I've already had this day major fight with my mother. We where having dinner and she started the ullshit about how I dont want lars to come to our house. What does she know!! it's not of her buisness. She was really after me at dinner, so I jsut had enough and took my plate and went from the table. She shouted after me that I wasn't allowed to leave before they were finished. I mumbled it was the most lame rule I had ever heard and that it was only bcuz so she could keep talking down to me. I don't care what she does now, I don't give a shit about anything...!  another thing... Yesterday at the party, my best friend deliberadly tryed to cut her arm with a lit from a beer in front of me. She said it was bcuz she was so ugly and stupid. Se was really out there! I took all the lits from her and tryed to give her some selfasteem. Today she wrote to me if she could come over. I didn't really feel in the mood cuz I know she is gonna start talking about my cuts, and how ugly she thinks she is. I just can't handle it all right now. I'm not the strongest person myself, so I can't help her... I told her that I was going to a dinner party with my rents, witch is a lie. She is a bit suspecious, but I had to lie, cuz I know that if I just told her that I didn't want to hang out with her, she would take it all wrong and she cant take that when she feels so down. IK feel so stressed having to lie and hide from everyone, but it's the only way I can manage to come out of this without hurting anyone...  sorry hope you all understands

       back   Sorry I haven't been updating so much lately, but there hasn't been much to write about. This week I've been with lars in the summercap again. Besides that I've not been doing a lot with my life. I went to a party with lars at some of my friends. We both got really drunk. Lars had to puke on the way home in the car, and I had to drag him up to his house. It was kinda imbarasing bcuz he woke up the entire house and his father came and asked me if I dared sleep with him tonight. I'm not afraid of him at anyu point, so I just layd besieds him. He was really sick and was shaking all over, so he asked me if I would hold him untill he fell asleep. I told him I would stay awake and watch out for him if got sick doing the night. I felt such an urdge to say to him that I love him, but was afraid that I only wanted to say that cuz I was drunk, so I did my best to keep the words in. Earlier on the evening he had old me again that he was falling in love with me, even though he had promissed himself that he wouldn't do that in a girl again. I don't know what went over him, but he started dancing with me outside and really hugged me. I think he was just really drunk, but most ppl say what they really feel when they are drunk so... Maybe that goes for me too about the love thing...  Anyway so fare we are doing great, except for when he brakes a promis. He does that alot, but I really don't think he does it on perpose. He just want's to be so many places at the same time, so he keeps his options open. I hate when he does that, but I always end up forgiving him... (it's a curse!)   ~maria
