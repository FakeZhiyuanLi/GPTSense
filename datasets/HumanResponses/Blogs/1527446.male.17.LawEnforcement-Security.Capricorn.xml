      I am simply not motivated to write lately, but hopefully I will have that motivation soon. I am look to buy a scanner because Ross has one and also because I have heard themfirst hand and you always know whats going on in your town.  Today was a good day of school ( I dont gauge my social interactions at all except for something out of the oridnary), I didnt have health class!!! :) .Though we are in the sex ed unit, I find it sometimes to detailed etc.Maybe its just me.Its not like there is straight up porn being shown, which is some what good because I mean for god sakes, we are in school!!   USA ALL THE WAY!!!

      I am so glad that school is over- on the other hand, our friend Ross isnt, simply for the social aspect. Now I cant really get down to his level of think on "social" issues but I can understand what he means. He doesnt get calls from girls etc or much less anyone else. I mean I guess he is glad not to have classes, but it seems as if he is totally not connected with people in the summer. GET OUT MORE ROSS, CALL PEOPLE,IM PEOPLE.   Anyway, i am glad school is over. I think we all deserve it! We had a long school year, going in late and getting out late... :( . Well we made it to the end of school- atleast most of us lol. Everybody enjoy your summer and I will be basking in the sun in Bermuda for 2 weeks in July!!  :)

      I have had a "not so fun" last 8 months, and I often think about the events that have taken place. I often think of my Mother. I know I cant do anything about her death , but I like to think that she is still with me every where I am. Maybe I am holding on to the feeling that she is still around, maybe I gota let go but I dont know what to do.  Everyday still even 8 months later I wake up expecting to see my mom downstairs fixing breakfast for me etc. I still set 4 placemats at dinner sometimes. I guess I just gota get use to it and let go from this feeling of loss. The problem is,I dont know how.   There are many serious and tragic events that has happend to me since November 5th 2002, my life could be a fucking movie with all  the real drama thats gone on in my life. Not that I am looking for excuses but sometimes you just hit a wall that keeps you from functioning normally for months, as I have been experiencing.   I dont want to depress anyone. Just needed to vent.

      I havnt been updating due to barlowspeaks.org. I havnt been up to much. I will be doing exciting things when summer comes. Untill then, finals!!! :( . Though thursday I dont have to go to school :). It seems as if barlowspeaks.org is sucessfull. I hope it stays that way. I just hope it doesnt go into a political and ethical war fare due to people personal views on certain things. Ross has maintained a great board so far and I hope more people join.   By the way, i am getting my year book tomorrow, I will sign peoples tomorrow (Monday)

      Well , I got my scanner up and running and its cool. I listen to NYPD, FDNY and local pd and fd. I cant wait for school to end.   News: Woman soliciting on my street was doing it with out a permit thus given a warning and left the neighborhood quicly! God only know what she was selling.Just told her to leave- and then we called the cops. she is gone :)

      Well I have not posted much lately thus I have a lot to say.   - Ross and I are not doing any film project.I is simply impossible or to much work and time. Time I have but would rather put it to other things. Ross told me that its going to be to hard to do it and I trust that and its not worth the time simply thinking about what to film let alone the time it takes to film it!  - Brian came over my house Saturday. We played tennis ( we are getting much better) and then we played Medal of Honor Frontline on my PS2 AND SUROUND SOUND system I have. We were able to beat one level but got stuck on the next.   - Also WHAT UP WITH ALL THIS FUCKING RAIN??? Its June and I am still wearing a wind breaker!! Something is wrong with that. It should be sunny, warm and school should be out, but thats another topic. to see my thoughts on the construction project, check out this cool message board ross made http://www.ngcomputerhelp.com/barlow2/

      Now that you know about my feelings on the war and Bush, i thought i would  talk about my cousin who is over in Iraq, he is in the Army, 82nd Divison,Delta Force (special operations, best of the best). By the way he knows how to kill a man 18 different ways with his hands, also he is 6'7  so ...haha. He was appointed by Clinton's chief of staff. I told him before he left to go to Iraq, shoot a iraqi once for me and once for practice :). I cant wait till he comes home.

      Today Ross and I talked about doing a film in which I would help with filming and I would also act. I cant wait to do this with him, it gives me a reason to get out of the house. I hope he goes through with it. The basic idea of the film is that  a person receives a package and gets a package thats intended for some one else and not them. In the packages, contains confidential goverment documents that aludes to something ilegal. Ofcourse this is not a real/true story but its interesting. I cant wait to start it. LET ME KNOW ROSS   USA ALL THE WAY!

      Well.... my life just goes up and down and right now as of this hour its very much down. My grandfather has got to get over my mother as do everyone else, but him inparticular. I just cant stand the arguments about stupid little things . We all take our frustration out lately on small problems and never address the real issue, thought and opinions are just buiding in all of our heads with out them being heard. Not good. I dont know what to do. All I know is,,, I hope the carnival is on tonight to get me out of the house and give me something productive to do.  I really have just gota stay out of everyone's way for a bit... I guess I am the one that causes all the problems around here. I never thought that till now,,, but its become very clear I have caused more problems then joyus moments. I think after the trip to Bermuda I gota figure something out---what I am not sure,, running away will not solve much,,convincing my grandfather to get help will never work,, what options do I have? VERY LITTLE!! :( .   I just gota get out of this house for some time. We all need this upcoming vacation. Brian and I will have a lot of fun because we can do what we want when we want. Tennis,golf,mopeding,jet skiing, u name it. :) ?   I just need to go to the carnival tonight, I need time away from home and doing something to take my mind off things. :(.

      The carnival was cancelled last night... due to rain. I hope tonight goes ok and the carnival is "GO". I hope I have a good shifts,, 5-8pm 8-11pm. I just dont want to be stuck at one place al;l night (especially keller lot) . Next big event is Easton Day for the explorers.  Bermuda 2 weeks away!!! :) . Will update tonight after carnival and will describe my experience as a explorer.

      Well, the meeting didnt go very well, there were alot of arguments on postions of explorers for example, secratary etc. What we need is structure, and with out Ofc.Mark there we got none. Let me say one thing... yelling gets people no where, as I have seen last night and many other times in my life. Just because you want to be heard doesnt mean anyone must yell... normally your are no more then 20 ft from a person during conversation.   Anyway, I signed up for the ride alongs today and expect to go out this coming week. I plant to work every shift , every night at the carnival, put my time in. I think its cool. It also gets me out of the house and gives me something structured and productive to do. A learning experience.   I think Ross comes back from D.C tomorrow, hope he had a good time.   Brian got his license today!! Congrats Brian!!-- 2, 1/2 weeks till Bermuda!!!

I hear from Ross,,, he found a girl in Wasington D.C he likes. (he is on a trip there) I say good for him,,, he deserves it. He is going about it all in the right way. No stupid storys etc. Good for you Ross!!  Lindsay may move to CA. this summer- that would not be good. Will update once things either progress on the sale of the house etc.  Thats all for now... Bermuda in 3 weeks!!!!!! :)

      things arnt resolved but alittle better .   "How do you think it makes me feel to take a great trip to Bermuda with out my own mother. If she didnt pass on, we would never have gone to Bermuda. You know the guilt I feel? Going out to dinner was something I didnt want to do either for a while because mom could never truely enjoy going out to dinner, so how could I? I just cant get past a lot of stuff and I guess i am not as "better now" then everyone thought I was. "  8/6/03

      Ya know....  I mean my life hasn't been "ideal" or fun this past year. I mean,,, its been awful. Today I went to pick out a gravestone for my mom. I mean, I never thought I would have to do something like this this early in my life. I guess,,, I always thought she would see me graduate and get married and have children etc. Isn't that what is suppose to happen? I guess not to everyone.  I probably should be more positive but its hard. I am going on this trip to Bermuda , with out my mom. I almost feel guilty in going. Nothing much I can do about it. Just have to try to have a good time.   Yes I go to the Hamptons etc -- ( i hate how people are like "O wow the hamptons..." so what, people if you have nothing good to say, dont say it. I mean it doesnt make sense that people are get up in my face when I mention things like that. Ohwell. I guess thats just how "society " is.   Just gota think positive and have fun on this trip.   -------------------------------- Police Explorer meeting tomorrow night. I think it will be more peaceful then last time. We all did a good job at the carnival,, more of a time for celebration for that then anything.   Will update after meeting tomorrow night.    USA!

      Life socially sucks , life academically sucks, nothing is working out. Life at home, well thats a entirely different matter.   As I write this I think to myself, what can be done to fix the problems in my life? I dont see any solutions. Sure there are kids starving in Africa, but ... it doesnt mean people cant have "not so good" lives here.   I figure that if I wasnt here so many things would be better for so many people.  I am just going to have to tough things out for a while .

      Welll,,  from a event today, I learned a heck of a lot about myself and other things. I was stupid for acting the way I was.   Do I feel ashamed , stupid , embarressed, yes. Do I care that what happend today was affecting that person that much?  Yes,   I never meant it to be that way  and things got miss - read and well, I cant do much about that.   All I can say is I have learned and am trying to move on from this day. I will move forward and hopefully take this experience and gain strength from.  To that person I am sorry and will not talk to again. I was stupid for acting the way I did and for that I am truely and sincerely sorry. I cant offer much more then the words I am sorry. I dont know what else to say or do.   The good times we had were, well, good. I can remeber some fun times. But in the end what I did was stupid and I am sorry.   Please forgive me and dont hate me, but if you do I understand. Good Luck in the future if we shouldnt speak again.

      At the start of today i was nervous about today. From the bus ride to about 2nd period I was nervous, but then I was settled back into the "not so fun " routine of school.   One thing I cant stand is teachers wanting these damn 1 inch binders because they just dont "work" for me. I hate it .The worst thing is they break easyer then spiral and spiral notebooks take less space etc. I guess these teachers dont care about students back or health what so ever. I am not weak but I mean its insane.

      Sometimes I feel that in Life there are as many problems as solutions but today I dont see any solution. The worst feeling in the world is to loose trust and loyalty in one of your best friends and that it appears as if there is no way of fixing it.    -----  Another note ,  Most will laugh at this but, I truely would like to be President of the United States. Most will say I could never do the job well etc. But its worth dreaming anyways. My reasonsing is that I feel there is so much in-justice in the world and that certain choice out current COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF is making are simply just not justified or smart descions. There are millions that feel the same way I do but, I just feel so urged to try to do something about getting peoples voices heard. There has to be a way to do it then just reps for region. What the news portrays is mainly byast to "bad-news" and never really gets the good news. Firstly, President Bush, I am sure is doing a lot of good things to but we never hear of them sincethe Wars etc. For the record I am a Independent. With Democrats, they spend alot in theMilitary and never use it and Repulbicans stretch our forces to thin ( as you can see in '91 , First gulf war, not enough troops ) .  Over all President Bush had to prove something to the U.S and the world that he (U.S) wont tolerate acts of terror. He had to show people he was going to do something about it and soon , so in my opinion he picked a easy target = IRAQ, its known he had at one point WMD'S and thus , we must invade!   Well I have a cousin over there still and he is getting sick of dealing with all locals who hate him etc.   Point is , I really feel like certain things should be changed and soon, if not , economy will not fully rebound causing a downward spiral in all consumer and industrial industry.

      Diabetes walk went well. raised 300$ ! :)   ----------  Regrets , NEVER HAVE THEM IF YOU CAN AVOID THEM. They will haunt you for your life and also when you think someting was worth it, it might not have been. You probably dont know the end result of a action you never took.   I carry a lot of regrets with me. Some seriusly major ones that I wish I should have done more or said something. But its in the past and there is no way of ratifying the situation. I think thats what a lot of people dont realize, you cant go back in time.

Unlike Ross - It wont mention names with out the persons written permission . I am still working on its contents, what should and should not be put into it. The written document will be a continuous and will keep evlovling untill I reach a certain age and settlement in my life ( roughly age 25-30) I wil start writting now to be able to remeber things as they were a year ago etc and just keep on writing and editing for a  long  time.

I dont want to get into the specifics but its life changing to say the least. This night has for ever changed my life. The things sayed are beyond inpolite for sure and this is a new low for me.

Something has gotta be fixed and soon because now without my mom, there are some serious issues that are yet to be dealt with and become increaslingly bad.   ------------------- Exams next week.

      ya know I took 2 showers today, cause i was cold etc :-). and i tryed to sit donw tonight and just hang with my grandparents and all my grandFATHER does is yell about y i took 2 showers, he normally yels cause i dont spend time with them, but when i do , he finds something else to yell about  its madness  he yells for 30 minutes about water etc  and yells how my grandma will side with me not him There is much more to say about it but i wont publish that part. This is just to frustrating. I am sure this a common thing in American households but it sucks. How can I do well in school if I am constantly unconfident with myself?, or at the very least afriad that my grades arnt good enough, so i work so hard and burn out then my grades end up really bad anyways.IS THERE NO JUSTICE?

      Up to date information on the Cancellation of the RH-66 Comanche contract :    It is one of the biggest program cancellations in the Army's history and comes less than two years after the service's $11 billion Crusader artillery project was dropped after $2 billion had been spent.   The RAH-66 Comanche helicopter project was launched in 1983 and was eventually to have cost more than $39 billion. The Army said it needed a stealthier, more capable armed reconnaissance helicopter not only to collect and distribute battlefield intelligence but to destroy enemy forces.

      Back to school , after a nice vacation .   I immediatly got thrown in the shit , the JWP. I had lost my analysis paper and since my computer crashed, lost it on my HD. So I  had picked up another writing to put in place of it, though it is not as good, it will have to do. I am finishing the JWP tonight.   ------  Bad News ,  The Army has decided to cancel its Comanche helicopter program, a multibillion-dollar project to build a new-generation chopper for armed reconnaissance missions.   My Grandfather was one of the test pilots for that back in 1995,96,97,98. He spents many years, nights and weekends  testing and flying  it to get it approved by the US Gov't .  DAMN THE US GOVERMENT.

I passed the written part with all questions correct, and the vision test I passed easily.   ------------  Wed-  A.M :Go get photo's from Brooks.

      Physical abuse, which is 19% of all substantiated cases of child abuse, is the most visible form of abuse and may be defined as any act which results in a non-accidental trauma or physical injury. Inflicted physical injury most often represents unreasonable, severe corporal punishment or unjustifiable punishment  Emotional abuse, which is 8% of all substantiated cases of child abuse, is commonly defined as the systematic tearing down of another human being. It is considered a pattern of behavior that can seriously interfere with a child's positive development. Emotional abuse is probably the least understood of all child abuse, yet it is the most prevalent, and can be the cruelest and most destructive of all types of abuse. It

       Age  from the Red Cross   You must be at least 17 years old to donate to the general blood supply. Learn more about the reasons for a lower age limit. There is no upper age limit for blood donation as long as you are well with no restrictions or limitations to your activities.

      Today was great untill I got home when I had mentioned that on March 15th at school I would like to donate blood. I have a rare blood type AB- which makes me want to donate even more. So when I had informed my grandfather about this, he was opposed to it as he sayed " I am malnurished and underweight" . Neither are true but he makes a fair argument about my weight as to I am boarderline weighing in at 119 lbs (110 is min.) Also that I would get aids from it, though rare , he beleives its possible.   This started a huge problem and arguments began. I am unable to realate to a 72 year old person in general , its even hard to relate to him on any current event.  Well , point being , it sucks to have to talk to him .   ----------------  In other news, Police Explorer meeting Thursday night 7:00pm.  Ride Along is scheduled for March 20th .

      I have learned over the past year especially , life is exactly like a game.  Have more friends then enymies. Keep your friends apart and far in between. I have found this strtegy to be really helpful. I am friends with people I never normally would be and have bridge the gap between what some call "social groups". This is a extrodinary find, for me . It has taken me a while but with large success with it.  Odds are i am at some point messin with  70% of the people I speak to. But the thing is , its not like im not trust worthy or anything or not a true friend, its just I stay on my toes with everything now. 100% of the time there is always one person im playing. Its gota be done.   Its about staying afloat and above the water. Its vital to everyday life .  I understand this can be taken way to seriosuly, but in esence its the facts of life and how I see things. Plz, no 1 take any personal offense to it.

      A cool book  > http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=ZYw1VjLo4E&isbn=1573222666&itm=1  -----  Anyways , I seem to be buying more music lately, from itunes. I got a total of 20 songs from then in a week.   Ross and the other soon to be EMT's have been going to ER to observe and assist when allowed. I will be doing this next year as I will be taking to course.  Ross had said to me "instead of being a laywer should I become a ER doctor? " I told him that he atleast has some idea as to what he wants to do in life.   As far as me , I know for certain I want to do something in the Law Enforcment field. I really enjoy it. I dont know whether it be for local PD or FBI ( most likely what I want) or Homeland security , im not sure.

      Ross has begun his campaing speech for Student Council President of the school year 2004-2005. He is running on the exact opposite that gets voted in. being qualfied but not popular. Thats the main idea. He stated yesterday that he is running becuase "this is what I believe in. student change, reform. I like to see a difference."  Ross was not available for further comments but noted that his speech will involve some wording that might be "concern" the administration after its review.    So overall his speech is moving nicely, in the begining stages. I am going to be filming this campaing, mainly as a excuse to use my nice camcorder. I like to document things.  --------------------  One issue I am still steamed about is the simple ways the administration has gone to such lengths to advertise the mission statement. But I guess its become somewhat of a dead issue.

       Bin Laden is next   ----------------- EPD Rules!   Dare Race went very well. approx. 170 people ran. Though I was in charge of most of what was going on, it was still a lot of fun.  ----------------------------------  Ross got his G5 Desktop today. I cant wait to get his old computer, its better then myn.  So , overall, life is very good right now, we are getting a new John Deere Tractor, a dog soon , ross's computer ,and I am making $ (though I had to pay alot of $ in taxes last week) All is good.   On another note, I have been contimplating whether or not to take most everything that has happend in my life (thats of interest) and put into book form. See , so many people know me , but they know little about me if you were to ask them, or atleast they would know um-important facts, or simply make assumptions. The story of me is complex, and sometimes very personal and compelling. But I feel that I want to at the very least document my life as it has unfolded thus far. It would cover the major events ( as I see them ) of my life by approx. It will range from a large variety of topics , I think, i am yet to figure the format of the "book" yet.

      Support our troops!  I was thinking that wtih 19 days left of school, I no longer really have any serious interest in girls . In otherwords I dont want a relationship. This is for many reasons : 1 - I wont see her as much during summer  2 - Do I want a relationship now ? I am not sure  ---------------------------  Ok, talking politics , I am begining to neither like Jonh Kerry nor George Bush. But should I protest and like Nader? I dont want to. He is old , to flimsy on so many policys and might wishy washy.   I dont like Bush for obvious reasons.  I am not seeing much of Kerry on the campainge trail lately.

      Support our troops!  -------------------  Well , Jen , My EX girlfriend and I are not getting along very well. Suddenly she realized that she lives in VA and its so far away for a relationship more then a friendship. Cant do much about it. I dont think I will see her again for a long time. She and I argued then she cryed, uggg, a mess. Lindsay had to be the middle person between us.  She didnt want to talk to me directly. I didnt realize it but she was having a hard time with the fact that we both want a relationship ,  but it would be near impossible due to distance.   She tends to party everyonce and a while and I cant trust her that well, god only knows who she will go out with behind my back and like 8 hours away!    Eitherway, if we did get together , life would move on , we would breakup and go to college etc. Any relationship would dwindle eventualy, we all will go our seperate ways at somepoint, meet new people etc. Ohwell.  So I found someone in JBHS. Is it a realistic person? I think yes.  I hope we speak more often. We have little conversations and just this year gotten to know each others names .   There is 1 other person that I have liked in the past but I dont see it working, as it didnt work the first time. We will have to see.  --  Carwash for Explorers at EMS 9-3 pm Saturday.

Certain girls looked really beautiful which might be the only reason to attend. Overall I just want this phase of enthused teens to be over about 1 night. We have years a head of us. MOVE ON. Maybe I am just crabby about it cause I did not attend. Either way , I would not have had much fun.   Everyday in school I see the girl I like, I think, If i went to the prom would her , it would just be 1 nice evening thats it. I would much rather do something with her outside of school functions, like dinner with out all the other people etc.   --  24 season finale is on tonight at 9pm EST FOX.   --  Anyone watch American Idol?

      Support our troops!     Ok, well my computer is working well, 512 RAM, will upgrade.  Prom is tomorrow night. As people are partying I will be at my house playing some computer game or sleeping. As certain people decide to drive drunk , I will be safe in my own house. I may have a byast feeling of the prom , since the person I had orignally asked to go with me, did not want to go. That was a awful day. But now I feel the prom isnt as a big a deal.   Would it have been nice to go and have a good time ?, yes. By not going is it a life shattering thing? , no.   I know of 4 good friends who are not attending tomorrow night. I know of a few friends who are going with people they think they have a chance with and in reality dont. People go to this event for different reasons and attend with sometimes almost anyone just so they can say they had a date to the prom. I find this pathetic, even more so then by me not going to it.   I have realized that I wont be going , end of story. But is it? Is there something I will regret by not going?  I found that the person I currently like has a date and is attending prom. I am not to worryed. My X is up from VA . :)

      Ross has made in my opinion a valid and truely great effort to win the Student Council President position. As the "ghetto" people would say " Props to ya dog, props."  Seriously though I was happy to see the way Ross aproached this election and went about everything in the right way.I wonder the actualt #'s of the votes. I don't think "Granola" (aka Kristen Stimola) won by much.   Naturally Ross is not going to be getting the votes of most females. Maybe its a bad assumption , but seemingly true. There is nothing he can do to change that.   Overall not one issues wasnt tackled or approached by Ross. He has some more "liberal/radical" idea's such as eliminating hall passes to a extent. I say radical because its simply never done before.   He mainly wanted to just represent the students of Joel Barlow High School.   I say "hats off" to Ross for alteast making a valid effort. Your voice has atleast been heard and you will always have your strong supporters , though few, always there.

      Bin Laden is next  ----------------- EPD Rules!  Well today ,  I went to the Danbury Mall. Got lots of summer clothes.    --- Hating my grandfather  right now.  He bottles up his emotions then explodes like once every other month. Not liking him now. Ugg, he means well I think. But he puts everyone down all the time. He doesnt deal with his "problems" like the loss of his daughter (my mom) . He just expects everyone to keep going and grieve privately. UGG!!

      Support our troops!  Well ,  I am back online here. 1 month old Dell has been down for 8 days. I first reformated 4 times , then that didnt work so I called Dell tech support, on hold for 45 minutes each time, talking to a man or women in the philipines who spoke poor english. Was told my problem was 3 differnt thing , only to be re routed to a guy in Texas who set me up with a technician who was 8 hour late to my house.   In the end, the dell is working ok. I know Ross has beeb saying, buy a mac, but to late now.  --  Other then that, some family issues. thats just to be ignored.

      Support our troops!  Its come to my attention that I have a lot more school work then I first thought. I have 4 essays due by mid next week. 3 posters and 1 powerpoint presentation.   --  In Study today in the media center , I was having a conversation with a student and we were talking about how Mac will unveil a really cool G5 laptop at the San Fransico conferen perhaps. We were comparing specs and speeds. Then I saw this really hot senior looking at me. She looked at me and rolled her eyes. I have no idea what that means. Is this a bad thing ? At the very least, instead of looking at G5's maybe I could have been improving my relations with this 1 girl I like who happend to be in the media center at the time. " Forget talking about G5's! Talk to the girl " i was thinking.   But as I left the conversation , she had already been gone for 5 minutes. That was one solid chance I had to speak to her, and no , I had to be discussing computers instead.   Now , maybe I will not have such a opportunity again to speak with her, as I dont see her often , or when I do she is off with her friends.   We will have to see how things go this week, and if another opportunity presents itself. If not, things may not materialize.   --

      Support our troops! Support John Kerry --  As I sit and observe a teenage couple yesterday , I realize how good but often the ups and downs of a relationship especially at our age ( 16.17,18 ) is just to much to handle. I know some will tell u otherwise and the opposite of how I feel. But as I write this I cant help but think that its such a very temporary relationship and almost more problems come from it then good.  As most are aware that our buddy Ross , feels very strongly on this issue. He may tell you he doesnt want sex etc from a relationship right now and thats fine. I dont know how many of him are out there who dont want that . Either way .  So if we break all this down , what makes teenagers go out with one another? What is the reason? Obviously you want to be more then friends with the person but  how  far do you want to go with that? I just think that many teens are in a relationship for little or no reason at times , also not knowing what they want out of it and end up getting hurt in the end.  Bottom line:  Looking for a solution? Dont go out with someone unless you know what you want out of the relationship and how long it  could  last .

As far as the migraines are concerned , everything was negitive and though they persist are being treated with meds.     The growth on my right rib cage is going to need further tests to either rule out or diagnose a list of diseases. There is apparently no connection between the growth and migraines which is a good thing. I am going to a surgeon for a consultation and I may have to have this removed via surgery. Sounds like fun to me ... :( .   What ever. Wil update when more info becomes avaliable .    --  I have been having re-occuring problems with my Dell ( what else is new ) . Well, I asked for a refund and to my surprise have be granted one . Dell wants 144.00 (15%) for re-stocking fee etc but otherwise I will be re-paid $844.00. This is great and thrilling news considering I was ready to really fight Dell for a refund.     I will be purchasing a new  iMac G5  when they are released and shipped during the month of September. So between the time of the return of the Dell and the arrival of the iMac , I will be using Ross's AMD comp.

      Support our troops! Support John Kerry  --  This evening my grandfather blew up about getting his meal specially prepared for him. I know, its stupid. He thought thats not how meals should be served. Then when my grandmother said it was for him, he fucking exploded after he realized we were having something else.  I cant begin to describe the amount of yelling. I lost my voice cause I was yelling so much.     As my grandfather storms down stairs to listen to what I mumbled under my breath to him , i was expecting him to start yelling again, no, he just looked at me with the evil eye. He then went upstairs and grabbed one of the cars keys and leaves. He goes to eat at the Diner in Monroe alone. Goes to the ATM withdraws 500$ and comes home. I convince my grandfather not to go for the night ( where he would go I dont know ) and now he is yelling more.     Bottom line, he is bitching about a meal made for him that he likes but not for himself.     --     God give me strength because this is becoming all to common and frequent. I want to know what can I do to solve all the many problems my family has ( i know familys have problems w/e , but each is differnt , so for those who will say every family has fights , shove it ) to do to fox this.     There are days I want my mom back and days I dont. Sometimes I think she is 110% better off then us.     I just am at a road block.

"So the European code has 13 digits, while the code used in the United States and Canada has 12. The 13-digit code took off and is used in most other countries. And the American side has finally made an accommodation with reality. The Uniform Code Council, the North American arbiter of bar codes, has told North American retailers that bar-code scanners will have to read the 13-digit codes by January. The 12-digit codes do not die; systems that can read 13-digit codes can also read 12-digit codes.     ''But the 13-digit standard is what it's all moving to,'' said Ray Tromba, an expert in retail and consumer products distribution for IBM Global Services. ''The 13-digit is the global standard.''      I cant buy something that has 13 digit bar code on it.  Its bad luck!!  any one have any thoughts?       I decided to stockpile products with 12 digit bar codes on em. I have to be able to last years. Look out Stop &amp; Shop!

      Support our troops! Support John Kerry  --  In reguards to  Ross's recent blog as of ( 7/20/04 ) , i feel the need to express my hatred to President Bush. With such occurences ( from the article " No Hummer left Behind" , http://www.sierraclubplus.org/hummerdinger/features/no_left.html ) , I bring up " the Bush administration was finally able to secure a $100,000 tax deduction for Hummers and the other largest gas-guzzlers on the road as part of his "economic stimulus" package." How ridiculous. I am speech less... im with out speech. This is truely how crazy and anti enviromentist he is , with out the slighest concern for people on many levels. For one thing, the people who purchase these vehicles are  not  the ones needing a tax break.       Bush's idea behind this ( and we know it was his idea cause how stupid it was ) was that if you lower the tax's more people would buy the car.  Vehicles had been languishing on dealer lots for more than six months, with no potential buyers in sight. With the new assistance from the Bush administration, dealers feel confident that sticker shock will no longer be a problem and more cars will be bought increasing the economy , encouraging buyers and the market to increase. W e dont need people buying these cars. Did you know that most parts for the car , though from a American Company are made in Canada and Mexico?     Creating tax breaks for people who own large vehicles when they dont have to , or forced to is wrong while ignoring the people who need a break and are FORCED to pay high taxes.     President Bush, why dont you think about lowering perscription drug costs, by forcing a limit as to how much a drug company can charge. Do it the canadians way, the gov't regulates the prices of drugs , hence the old people crossing the boaders in coach buses everyday. Work on problems like that!! Just to name 1 of hundreds.     But Hummer dealers were elated following the ceremony. In a statement released by Hummer of Alaska, the dealership praised the Bush Administration for creating "a tax 'loophole' so big, you could drive a Hummer H2 though it!" Doesnt that just scream , getting away with murder? Is this a free for all? Lets go out and all by large vehicles and slap pro- bush bumper stickers or window clings in our windows praising Bush. How about  no ?     I cant even beleive he took the time to initate a act like this. Doesnt he have enough self inflicted problems on his plate now.     What ever happend to fairness and equality when it comes to the avg person. It is not fair that a person will pay the same amount in tax for a hummer as someone else would owning a honda civic. Thats mad. Well I am mad.     The bottom line is that if you can afford a Hummer, pay the damn taxes that appropriatly go with. Drive it , love it , just dont cry about the high taxes you should rightfully be paying and not get away with. I for one have little agains the car, I know its not good for the enviroment and I dont like that but, the concept and Idea of the car is ok. Trails, mountains. Use it there.       (for those of you who know my uncle drives a Hummer H2  I can say that he for one has no problem with the high taxes as that was in consideration when the H2 was purchased. He drives it rarely , maybe once every 2-3 weeks driving 30 miles max )

      Support our troops!  I was talking things over with myself, yes myself , and have found that I am distancing from my moms death. I am moving on from the situatuon more and more as time goes by. I have learned  that time heals many wounds. Noty entirely , but it helps. I havnt spoken to my dad in 1 year or more. I am not even sure what he thinks about me anymore. I dont think I care, but not sure. He maybe realizes the large mistake he made with being such a incredibly large jackass in more ways then 1 for several months of hell. Either way , it doesnt change anything.   Moving on from my dad ... I hope that life gets easyer in reguards to this last year of school. Junior year I still felt large effects of whats transpired 2002-2003. It hit so hard im just getting up and dusting myself off now about to go on.   -- Going to start a video project this week on the election and what it affects, from peoples to animals and all that lies in between. It will be an ongoing process concluding February 1st 2004, the first day of presidency for the 2004-2008 term. If you are asking why I am doing this, it provides a angle of America of how and election does and does not impact a person.

LanceA28: well i want more then a plasma tv. i want to know it intimatly ****:Yea, you want to sit in front of it every night, staring at it's beauty, you want to take it in for all it's worth.  The amazing technology.It doesn't matter what it says to you, what's on the screen, it's just that it's yourself, in your own home.  It's a status symbol and something to marvel at and you like it.The point is that you need to look beyond looks, so to speak.  People are not objects.  You should shop with a blindfold on.  What does looks matter if one's personality is horrible.  Sure, you don't want someone who's wider than your uncle's hummer, but your standards are unreasonable."  Now what **** says is not exaclty accurate. I love women for who they are and for what they have to offer into a relationship. A relationship is a mutual thing. The dictionary stating a relationship to be, "The condition or fact of being related; connection or association." I agree , 100% .   Women are amazing and should alway be treated with 100% respect and with dignity. Any less is unacceptable in todays society.

      Support our troops!  --   I got to thinking what it would be like if life had a " rewind " or " pause " button. Would you know when to use it ?   If you were to pause time trying to keep and capture a cherrished unstained moment that you will spend the rest of your life to reclaim , is it worth it, is it reality? These are some of the questions I ask. Some say memories are just images of good and bad. Memories are not just that but a taste of what was. Its a sense of of imagery that provides good and bad emotions , sentiment and soul. Sure the times are gone , but is it not worth it to rekindle a time that may once have been the summit of your life?   Would you change anything that was bad or good? And if so , what would be changed. After reading thus far , you may be thinking , whats the point of this because its impossible to rewind or pause time. Well I say to that , its provides reflection , rumination,speculation and  consideration.   I am not saying I would try to change the world but I would think twice on many actions of which I have taken. Ahh! But now I think that maybe what I want to change would cause more damage then good. The course of time etc would easily be off balance by changing the date I was born and my mom (med advacement reasons). Realistically I wish I could have changed the relationship with my father. I continue to think it was my fault that our reltionship is the way it is. Though I dont know exactly how I would start there, for that would alter my life so much for the good.    I have entertained the thought of being in specific places at certain times before something tragic occured.   This is just thoughts that have run through my head and I wanted to see them in writing. Ofcourse I can not do any of these things. Given what I would change I would probably try to apply the circumstance to the present time and deal with it from there.

      Support our troops! -- Bush's radio address today  : "Good morning.  My most solemn duty as President is to protect our country, and in the three years since our country was attacked, we have taken important steps to overcome terrorist threats to this nation.e have pursued terrorists across the world, destroying their leadership and denying them sanctuaries.  We are working with other governments to break up terror cells and stop planned attacks, on virtually every continent.  We've created a new Department of Homeland Security......... " ,            BLAH BLAH BLAH.  Though later in the address what struck me in taking a 2nd look was this , "... our country is safer than it was on September the 11th, 2001. "  Ofcourse our contry is safer then the day of 9/11. Any place is safer the NYC , DC that day. How stupid is that sentence. No matter what he meant, its a very un-intelligent sentence. On 9/11 we were attacked , out fireman and police and ems were the first soldiers into the war on terroism. NYC and DC were the front lines as far as I see it. Someone explain to me then how a place is  not  safer then NYC and DC on 9/11/01 ??                         ------ Cheney in July '04 at a rally in Arizona , speech ,  " Now, as you might have heard, there was a political gathering in Boston this week.   THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's now official -- I have an opponent. (Laughter.) No, really, I have an opponent. People keep telling me that Senator Edwards was picked for the job because of his good looks, his charm, his great hair. (Laughter.) I said, "How do you think I got the job?" (Laughter and applause.) " Exactly how did he get the job ? Now I am not saying Edwards is 100% what we need but, come on!! Cheney is as well qualified as my cat for VP.                 ---------- I thought I would express my mind alittle on the crack squad of savy motivators and do'ers in the top of this country. If Bush means the ideals of the US , well I  am  moving to Australia . As far as polls go , the race overall is close. Though today Kerry had a 8% lead on Bush when it came to who the people trust more on national secuirty. What does that tell ya ? Lets get Kerry in office and maybe we can focus on a few more things then just Terroism. Not to say terroism isnt a important issue , but lets apply some focus on medicare, education and enviroment.

      Support our troops! --  Went out dinner , nice steak.  I have been thinking , if I dont take advantage of this window of oppurtunity  with a specific girl.  I think if I dont act soon on this I will never get a chance at her again in life. She is one of the  people that come across in life that are far and few between. We shall see what happens. I am really hoping all goes well . Though if I dont act on this at all I will be missing out on a grear girl and oppurtunity.  I also have some horrible news. Australia has been pushed to Feb. break due to a surgery my grandfather has to have in mid-aug . I am sooo distrought about not going as soon as I had planned. The plus side is that my relatives who are still in school would be off, because its there summer. Its a mixed reaction, anger but at the same time I am still going soon enough.  Plans to ship this Dell back are underway and to buy iMac in Sept.  Next summer : urlLink  Fiji .

      Support our troops! Support John Kerry -- The last night of Carnival 2004. Good night overall. Had Keller lot. One incident that was truely a mis-understanding that seems to be resolved. I thank the person who dealt with it.  One event, EMS took care of one med problem.  The car raffle. well Officer Mark Pastor and I were in the tent of it and were the officials to OK the ticket taken out of the big wheel. A guy who lives off my street won the car.  Overall I still think Thursday was the best night because I got to spend part of the night with a certain someone .  Thanks to all explorers for working. Great job out there.
