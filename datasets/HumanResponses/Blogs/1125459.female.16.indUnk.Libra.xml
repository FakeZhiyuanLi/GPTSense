      Just one more thing before snooziness-  The greatest word ever in the known English language (I say this, because many words have yet to be invented... simply waiting in the non-existence, waiting to be pulled into existence...)  But anyway, the greatest word:    BLURB .  I needn't say more.

      Isn't it sad when you only realize you have an addiction when you're in too deep to really stop? Yeah. Quizzes. Online quizzes. Most of them are lame and repetitive. And honestly, I don't care. It's something to do, right? RIGHT?!?! Yes, I'm completely obsessed. And I'm sorry. But take more quizzes!!

      So, a question- is it possible to be in a pensive mood without ever forming a single thought? Because that's definitely where I am right now. I'm in the state of mind of being thoughtful, of deeply thinking and considering and musing... but I can't actually  think  about anything. So, what am I to do?  Why is it that I can go from being in a perfectly content mood to thinking about not thinking? To lacking something. That's what this is, I lack something. Currently. Maybe it's just happiness. I need a bit of it... just a bit, but it's becoming more and more necessary everyday. And why is it that this elusive, ideal thing seems so far away. It could be so close... so maddeningly close, but it's not. It's not even in sight anymore. Or perhaps it is around the bend, just temporarily, and I've lost sight of it. Perhaps I'm terribly close, but I just can't see it. *Sigh* The race, the chase... it wears me down. These years of the same chase... off and on, are we actually going anywhere?

      i still recall the taste of your tears. echoing your voice just like  the ringing in my ears. my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore. scraping through my head  'till i don't want to sleep anymore  Come on tell me You make this all go away I'm down to just one thing And I'm starting to scare myself You make this all go away You make it all go away  I just want something I just want something  I can never have You always were the one  To show me how Back then  I couldn't do the things  That I can do now This thing  Is slowly taking me apart Grey would be the color  If I had a heart  I just want something  I can never have In this place  It seems like such a shame Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same Everywhere I look  You're all I see Just a fading fucking reminder  Of who I used to be  I just want something I just want something  I can never have Think I know what you meant That night on my bed Still picking at this scab   Something I can never have- Nine Inch Nails

       Ahh, perspective. Yesterday, as vaguely explained earlier, was hell. Now, usually I absolutely despise Thursdays. I mean, I have to think biologically at 7:45 in the morning, and then go to see Null. But today, I only had one test... and so compared to yesterday, it was a marvelous day filled with ...wonder. Thus, I have gained perspective. 'Tis a splendid thing.   On one hand, I really, really, really cannot wait for the freedom of summer. On the other hand, I dread it because it means losing a good friend... at least physically speaking. Not like that.

      I got a new umbrella. It's the coolest thing, silver and black, huge... metal tip. I like to use it as a cane, but of course if you do that you've gotta have that cool 'I have a cane' walk, strutting about like y ou've got money to burn or something. It's such a cool umbrella. I think I'll bring it to school tomorrow, regardless of weather, carry it to all of my classes... yeah. So I've got two   huge   tests tomorrow morning. All before lunch, which is of course an early thing at 11:15. Urg, I have to go in early for math and then history, in which my hand falls off if I'm successful in both my essays. Right now I'm looking up all these pics ... marvelous wonderful pictures of wings, statues, really cool architecture, old street lamps, the Sistine chapel. I love this stuff. There is such beauty in the world if you look for it. Such breath-taking beauty.

      You are night, you are dark and mysterious, you have more than likly been through some kind of truma, depression. you have a creative mind, and more than likly find peace enjoyment in drawing, painting, writing. You are closed and hidden away from people, and hide you emotions behind a wall which you use on people. Try to become more open, spread your creativity, you have no idea of how many people there are out there like you, exposing your art and yourself can make other people come out, so many people would look up to your for your courage and your spirit, your not evil or bad, just missunderstood, so get out there and show them just what you are made of, don't worry about what other people think, it's what you think that really matters.

      Well well well, the old fashioned 17th century vampire, one of my faves. You look for the good things in life, you posses a lot of classical class, and follow that of the original vampires, you have no shame in what you are, infact you embrace it, you love it and wouldn't have it any other way. Your wealth is unspeakable and your way of luring people with your mystical ways and looks is amazing, and most people would often call you The Seductress.

         I'm not a loner, dammit!!    You're Element is Night. You're a loner who is very creative but never show your work to anyone. You may smile a little but sadness or loneliness surround you and other can feel it when they're near you. You have a dark or unusual beauty that makes you mysterious and you probably have a lot of secrets that you've never told anyone. You're beauty is intriging and unorthidox but the real thing that makes you special is your eyes. Something in them makes them like "Diamonds in the Rough."    urlLink   What's Your Element(girls)?

      I've decided I really must move to Oregon or Seattle or something. It's raining again, and I'm so completely in love with it, it's ridiculous. Places like Oregon are all gloomy, everyone gets so tired of the rain and gloominess... but I would be consistenly happy! I don't know why it has such an effect on me. It's calming, certainly... and thunder and lighting have this thrilling effect on me. Maybe it really is the rarity of it that I love. *Shrug* Just the same, four years immersed in rain... I wouldn't complain.

      Ashley should  really  be doing homework, but I have to voice my thoughts on the weather right now. Indecision. I hate it above snow... not above ice and high winds, but I hate it a lot. It's such a Sunday in my mind right now. Gray, gloomy... dreary. Blah. I hate this color outside, when it could clear up or could snow- the houses make everything look a few shades duller, because they're all earthy tones. It gives me a headache. It tells me of what I'll have to deal with tomorrow. In the very early morning. This is so ridiculous, we're not meant to function so early! I have Bio first period!!! Teenagers are made for late afternoon, evening... night. We're not cut out for early morning. It doesn't help that we're all programmed to respond to bells. Urg. Good luck, dear friends, on the hellishness of Monday. Because of school, I have no life. I spent the bulk of today at Caffe Sole doing hw. Granted, I was w/ friends and that was lovely... but I wasn't there to have fun. I had to spend my saturday night at school, and yes... I did get to see drumline's winterline, but I was at school. On a Saturday night. If only it started at noon... at least I'd get proper sleep, then.    I've gone from sentimental, to sentimental again- and then to the weather. Sorry. I realize the quality is down lately. Give me something to rant on, I will.

      My conspiracy theory.   What They Don't Want You to Know In order to understand conservatism you need to realize that everything is controlled by a cult made up of nazis and dmv employees with help from the libertarians. The conspiracy first started during the dawn of civilization in what is currently the middle east. They have been responsible for many events throughout history, including all the terrorism in the world.  Today, members of the conspiracy are everywhere. They can be identified by ritual frog burnings.  They want to annihilate the working class and imprison resisters in the heart of Texas using small planes and barbed wire fencing.  In order to prepare for this, we all must attempt assassination. Since the media is controlled by the democratic and green parties we should get our information from president george w. bush.   Heh, it's like a mad lib. I miss those things...  urlLink

      It's still going strong- stronger! I love puddles. I'm going to add that to the list. Puddles show how hard it's raining... those rings, so many of them... all at once. Yes, I love puddles. And rain. I love rain. Droplets collecting and running down the window, catching in the screen... falling onto the windowsill. Mm, that wonderful smell permeating my room, my things.       Rain: You are the sound of rain. You have two important sides. There is your strong, powerful side and your calm, gentle side. Both are very important. Rain also reflects a bit of darkness in your personality. It isn't bad, just shows that along with the good, you also can see bad, which can come in handy.    urlLink   What Sound Are You?(now w/ pics)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Oh yeah!

       RAIN!  Oh god, it's been so long, too long... way, way too long. I've missed it so much! That wonderful tapping, and the smell! Mon dieu, the smell is like nothing else in the world! Shiny roofs, glossy pavement, and thunder... my long lost lightning! Even if it is cold right now... even if it's not thundering, I am content. My mood has been less than happy all day, and it's the bloody indecision of the weather. I can't stand gray days, that are cold and dreary. I just cannot... either snow or rain or be sunny. Not this indecision. But oh, now I am content! Now I'm happy... and it's probably not healthy that I depend so much on the weather, but... the first few drops, walking home... gave me chills. It's been so long. There is nothing more depressing to me than winter. Perhaps I should simply move to Oregon, live w/ Stacy, and go to college there. I would be the most content person there. I have never understood how rain is seen as unhappy... I mean, no.. you can't go outside cuz there's some water falling from the sky. Yeah, that's about it. :) My window is wide open for now. And it's perfect... for the moment, maybe even for the hour... I'm completely content.

      Weird mood, I guess. Not anything bad or particularly self-destructive- just pensive, you might say. I think too much, if you couldn't tell. That's why I'm such a philosopher, frankly. Anyway, right now I'm just thinking about all my friends and people I love. I'm too loving- I love you all so much more than you will ever know. I would die for any of you in an instant... but what if I  did  lose someone... I can't even imagine. I feel things strongly- I like to think I've got a pretty good idea what goes on emotionally w/ those around me, I can usually read most people. Not all, by any means, but a good few. I've seen souls laid bare before me. I absorb it all... I feel things very strongly, stronger than most of what I've seen. Of course I don't show that, and what you might see is a fraction of what goes on. But if I lost someone, I would lose part of myself. This is why I'm hard to get close to... it's all self-importance ;) . But stuff like that plagues me. Like, what if my mother died by some twist of fate- custody might go to my father. I would be in the custody of the one person in this world I hate. I don't hate people, I'm empathetic towards everyone.... but I hate him. So much. Honestly (this sounds more morbid now, sorry) I can say I would not be able to deal with life if that happened. I would do whatever it might take to get out of that situation... Too much thinking, like I said. But for some reason I feel loss on the edge of my consciousness. Hopefully it's nothing.

        SIGN THE GUESTBOOK   Thank you to those of you who already have. Yeah, that's only two of you. I gave this address to more people that that... psh.    Do you ever find yourself getting lost in the beauty of things. Perhaps it's just my romantic side, but just the same. Yesterday I had some great music going, and I felt like drawing- so I took this rose I got on Thursday for V-Day, and put it on my windowsill. This was just after the sun had set. And so I drew it, though the drawing doesn't do it justice... after it started getting to twilight (mind you, I've got this thing for twilight... best time of day), and I had a light pointed at it. It was... striking. Contrast of color and all that... it just struck me. Gave me chills. So, you know, I ended up staring at it until I realized it was dark... And then these incredible stars showed up outside my window. Venus, I can always see from my window. That wonderful bright blue twinkling... I guess it's the simple stuff that gets me. When I'm in the right mood. :) I should've been doing my homework. *Shrug* Sometimes you have to make sacrifices for, erm, a greater good. Yep.

      It is unfortunate that I am only inspired when I am very unhappy. Looking back on Friday night, I cannot remember the source of it... of course what I wrote always holds somewhat true, but for now I am not unhappy. I must seem bipolar now... these nights of happiness and unhappiness are completely random. Friday I had a good day, I had fun. Spent the day with two of my good friends, one after the other. And then when I was alone, I was  really  alone. My mind should be shut off sometimes, because too much thinking does this. Regardless of anything said, thinking is a very bad thing when used improperly.   And now, the best of the bunch I should say, the best stuff EVER. AKA Stuff I've got weird obsessions with.

      I'm.. empty. Not entirely sure why... granted I've got some idea, but not entirely. And it's at times like this I really understand how fleeting true happiness is. Bloody hell, if you're happy, enjoy the  fuck  out of it. This emptiness makes me ridiculously cynical, but more than anything I'm completely lonely. When I'm with/talking to someone, anyone, I'm distracted. But soon after, it settles back in. When the silence in my mind starts ringing, the weight of it sinks in... the burden. No one is really online and those who were wouldn't hear out my entire rant... thus bringing me here. What the hell is the point of all this? All this unhappiness... striving for one or two happy moments, and then living through the unhappy- simply existing. There is no long run in this, because life is short-lived. And I am entirely empty. I loathe every inhalation because it sustains me until the next. This harsh reality is a bitter taste I cannot rid myself of. I am sickened by it all. I need... something, some escape, some release from all this- but there is nothing. Ultimately, I will go on... for another day, another week, another year. Existing until the next rare moment... when I may be truly happy, and forget all of this emptiness. Hollowness and diversion. I detest this reality, this nature of being.   I need a hug.

      Hmm, what's a good rant topic? Fear and religion. Yes. Heh, no offense is meant anywhere, mind you. I met someone in mythology class last semester who said he would rather suffer unfathomable pain than die. Because he was athiest, he believed when he died, there would be nothing more... lack of existence. I understand the logic behind that, I suppose, but it conflicts my views rather... violently. I have always been in awe of religion throughout human existence- civilization. Worship of some sort is apparent in thousands of cultures, millions even, over the years of civilization. As I see it, there are three possible reasons for this. Maybe two... hard to say if the last fits w/ the others. 1) There is some higher power above humanity, and humans have found out about this in multiple societies. 2) Humans are driven by a fear of death that surrounds them- afterlife is created to dissipate this fear, and gods are created over the years to explain away natural occurences, seen as phenomena. 3) Human nature calls for a need of order, some heirarchy to keep things in line. Mythologies are created for this purpose, as well as fear of death.   Now we're clear on that... the rant part. Why fear death so much? You look at different beliefs, and unless you've been a horrible person and you know you've been "evil," and you're going to hell in your mind... or some similar place- I mean, why else would you spend every single day of your life avoiding death. It happens everyday, it's natural... keeps the population down. Suffering I can understand, of course. No one likes pain. Scratch that, few people like pain. But death... especially if you don't believe in your classic afterlife of happiness/unhappiness. If you don't exist, you're not going to care much.   *note to self: rant on good and evil soon

      Humor me for a bit. Someone brought this up yesterday, I guess it was. Bad words. Those socially unacceptable, ugly, negative words, the ones adults try to avoid using around kids, for fear that youngsters will hear and, god forbid, repeat. So.... why? Why is it necessary to have such words. They're synonyms to perfectly acceptable words, but these select few are not to be uttered in public. They're just words. They don't hurt anyone... and if they do so emotionally, this is because society tells us that these words  can  hurt you. Ultimate restriction, isn't it? Telling us what we can and cannot say... in public places. Certainly this is not democratic, etc?? All this fuss about censorship of words... they're bloody words! I mean, words  do  nothing! They're hardly expressive enough to cover all communication in life. But I suppose we need those socially unacceptable things to balance us all out, to be more expressive... and to corrupt young people with. Words... of all things. Language, the mark of civilization. Syllables strung together, phoenetic letters... symbols, pronunciation. Nothing more, but we're dependent on them. We base culture off them, society, government. Too much importance, perhaps.

      Ashley is confused. I took the What Mythological Form quiz thing like a month ago, and I was a vampire... and I took it again to get the code yesterday, and was a dragon (don't get me wrong, dragons are the epitome of cool, I'm just confused). So I took it again today, and now I'm a vampire again. I think it changes with moods. I'm going to put both results up. It's my blog, I can do whatever I please! I'm completely addicted to online quizzes and tests. I love the spark, but they need new stuff. So, take quizzes online! Fun, fun.  Random poetry- it rhymes. It's poetry.   There is a fox, who lives in a box by the docks- he has chicken pox. He's dating an ox. Fox likes to eat lox, say Weezer rocks, and wear spiffy socks.  If stuff is overlapping when you've got this at full screen, like the quiz results and whatnot, let me know. I've just discovered it can do that... so, I'll try to fix it if anyone tells me to.

      Figure I'll get these weird lists of mine out of the way first. So following the best words EVER, only  some  of the best song lyrics EVER. I'll add to these when I think of stuff most likely.   Vows are spoken to be broken; feelings are intense, words are trivial I'm so happy cause today, I found my friends, they're in my head These chickens are fish in a barrel and the tall one is gonna be for sale Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath The world is not enough but its such a perfect place to start...and if your strong enough we can take the world apart I’ve been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know I made –for you- of you, let’s see what needles do The hand on the knife in my back feels like mine Never again is what you swore the time before Pleasures remain so does the pain I’ll wait for you at the bottom of the bottomless blue Breathe out so I can breathe you in Words like violence break the silence Today seems like a good day to burn a bridge or two The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care Had other interests- he liked to burn things! You can’t change fate… it’s just like the weather The sweetest perfection to call my own; the slightest correction couldn’t finely hone I’m so happy dancing while the grim reaper cuts, cuts, cuts, but he can’t catch me Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him, an empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within His thoughts like a hundred moths trapped in a lampshade It's just another day where people cling to light to drive away the fear that comes with every night Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage I don’t bother chasin’ mice around- I slink down the alley, lookin’ for a fight, howlin’ to the moon on a hot summer night Poor woman strangled in her very own bed as she read, but that's ok- she was old, she would've died anyway And if the people stare, then the people stare If I must be lonely, I think I'd rather be alone I don't understand what destiny's planned, but I'm starting to grasp what is in my own hands  I'm so sane, it's driving me crazy I don't want to wake up on my own anymore They gave you life, and in return you gave them hell I'm burning all your stuff, but that's not enough Leave your body and soul at the door And when it's all been said and done, better that you had some fun Oh boredom is so terrible, it's like a dread disease- nothing could be worse than when there's nothing on TV I say the right things, but act the wrong way- I like it right here, but I cannot stay You will always wonder how it could have been if you'd only lied I don't advise and I don't criticise I just know what I like with my own eyes You've been hanging from a rope of mediocrity strung up by your insecurities You'd be wasting your time saying no, it's a crime All we're demanding you'll supply- all we're accused of we'll deny Pain is ready, pain is waiting primed to do its educating A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt- how I suffer the sweetest condition As the darkness closes in, in my head I hear whispering From the depths of my emptiness comes a feeling of inner bliss I'm so happy dancing while the Grim Reaper cuts, cuts, cuts, but he can't get me I'll take you to the highest mountain, to the depths of the deepest sea- we won't need a map, believe me Feeling unknown and you're all alone flesh and bone by the telephone You wear guilt like shackles on your feet, like a halo in reverse

      Welcome to my   BLOG.   So this is where I plan on putting absolutely random crap I think about, so that one day I'll go back through my archives... and wonder why I wasn't committed sooner, as I sit contentedly in my small padded room. Anyway, I hope you... well, I suppose I'd worry if you thoroughly enjoyed this, but I don't want it to bore you to death, otherwise you'd never come back. So, I hope it amuses you to the point that you bookmark it... or at least look at it once every few months.   I have no idea what I'll be in the mood to write about, so be prepared for the worst. Thoughts on the day, on life, and on neat words... just a warning, that's all.   Oh, and check out the links if you get bored. Fun, fun.

      Happy April Fools Day!  4/1/4 A Palendrome!   She mentioned the letter! Hahahaha, I was trying not to burst out laughing.. I did make eye contact w/ all the people in the room who knew, though. Karolyn, who was sitting next to me, turned to me as she was saying this and said "It was Brenda. She was so mad at Ms. Null!" I was like, oh really? Unfortunately Null doesn't read anonymous letters- actually she had to have read it, but not responded. She said what it was about, said it was complaining and she'd have to read part to know. I'm re-sending, because it had some valid stuff in there. I'm putting this at the beginning:  I am somewhat offended, Ms. Null, that you didn't read my letter to you the first time. I spent a good deal of time composing this, and just because I don't sign my name, you ignore it. Contrary to what you may think, I am not composing this for my own benefit- this is the reason I did not give you my name, otherwise you would've confronted me, and it is nothing to do with my personal concerns. This is the voice of all your students. Everyone I know of was dissatisfied this break with your workload alone. I do not feel very respected as a student that you would not hear me out and consider my thoughts, even if you don't know who I am. Consider me all of your students, or at least a majority. Please, this time read what I have to say. Do me that favor, as a student.

         -    Hyphenate. Is that not a testament to the beauty of language? Some genius decided that no, we wouldn't be commoners and spell it hifen.... it wouldn't be hifenize. No, it would be beautiful. It would be.... hYPHenATE! *clapping and sobbing at the beauty of the word in the background ensue*  Yes. Ok. I told myself I wouldn't stay up this late. I'm not used to it, so I get all....weird at this time of night. Odd, even. I was telling Mike about how my drawings all talk to one another, and how Demon is the cockiest of them, but I suppose he has right to be as he's one of the best things I've ever drawn. And that's why he'd make fun of Griffin if I made him too fat. So it's perfectly logical, right? Yes. It is. Shh, it is.

      Now that I have a moment, I think I'll compose something of a letter....rant... thing. Whether or not I send it will be up to you, my readers...tagboard. We're referring, of course, to Null.    Over the course of this school year I have not been so infuriated by a teacher as I have this week. What many teachers, specifically those of advanced students, fail to realize is that their class is not, nor will it ever be, the sole priority homework-wise. Certainly I understand the purpose of homework over a break; it is a necessary evil for both parties. However when it is given to the point where a student must focus on one class' work for days at a time, something is wrong. You must understand that the majority, if not all, of advanced students who take an advanced class are bound to be in others.   My assumption of the average would be three. In sophomore year, these are coupled with either chemistry or biology, difficult classes without the advanced label. All of the teachers of these difficult classes feel that certainly, in the minds they are molding, his or her own class is the most important. Thus, his or her students should spend the majority of their time focusing on that class. You cannot imagine the workload when they feel we have an entire week to work.     A perfect example is your own class. While I mean no offense, this has become ridiculous. Finishing approx. 200+ pages of a book, find and read another book, and finally do a book write-up. On its own, this would be reasonable. Add to that about an hour of math homework, the nightly average, any worksheets, lab reports, or readings (all of which take more time than it might seem), and an obscene amount of reading for history (this especially occurs for those in Mr. Mainland's class, the readings for which takes anywhere 1-4 hours with notes, per chapter). I have not even made mention of extra-curricular activities! My point, dear educator, is only education. Please, please think before assigning things which will prevent us from ever maintaining relationships with other human beings outside of school. Sometimes I think it practically cruel of some teachers, but then I remember that you are simply ignorant to our situations most of the time. I beg you take this advice to heart.   Sincerely, An over-worked student

      Hello. As I've just whined a bit in my last two posts (I  had  to, otherwise I would've been worse), I'm going to write about a happier topic. Fanfiction. For those of you who know what it is, allow your minds to wander for a moment as I explain. Fanfiction is an assembly of stories... using characters, settings, etc. from an already existing series, tv show, etc. There is a lot of crap, yes... but it's very much worth looking for the good stuff. It is what has been cheering me up lately.   Draco/Harry shippers, if you haven't, I'm forcing you to read Underwater Light.  urlLink Link.  It's the best fic I've read in a very, very long time.   Anyway, I'm putting a link to Harry Potter fanfiction under my links because it is, in my opinion, the only fanfiction worth reading.

      Alas, not having a lovely time of Spring Break! I have the worst flu I have ever had... so I've been sleeping off and on for the past 24 hrs. I only got 3 hrs last night. Yep, not a lovely break. I'm also somewhat isolated to my room and bathroom... stairs take a lot out of me. So, understandably, I'm a bit bored. When I'm not sleeping. *Sigh* Feels like I never get a break.

      Hahaha, I fixed it. The blog format is better now, no? Well, if it's more fucked up, tell me. Don't just pretend it's fine.     Now, for a rant of sorts.     Life, simply put, is a bitch who employs all sorts of ironies and evils for sadistic reasons. Just when things are going well... you think maybe life isn't such a horrible bitch, maybe there is happiness to be found... Life takes a dagger (no, not a knife... a crooked rusted blunt dagger) and twists it around in your back... she leaves it there for a little while. Just when you think you can bear the pain, maybe you can go on living... oh no, she hasn't forgotten you. She takes out the dagger and lets the wound heal for about a day... and then she plunges it back in, twisting it all the while. Why do I even bother to chase happiness w/ the masses? I know it's unattainable. It'll always be around the corner... but no one will ever catch it, pin it down. And all the while you've got Life plunging daggers into your calves as you try to run with the pack, try to catch perfection... simple, momentary perfection. That's exactly why it is such. We're low low life forms... we'll never be happy. Not for long. Always the teaser of what could never be. Teasing and twisting. Why do we bother.  You must excuse this... I can't say I've been in the best of moods. Maybe it'll improve in a month or so. *Sigh* I'm just not having a wonderful time of things.             You are a silver dragon.

      So, I know I've posted an obscene amount of crap lately, but I'll stop for a little while after this. But the crap is all your faults! When I get bored, I take quizzes and whatnot and post. Anyway, you might be noticing that the setup of my blog is a bit different. It's because of the Dante's Inferno test bit... but I've been told this is easier to read... of course, no one  told  me the blog was being stupid and overlapping... psh. So, if this is worse on your computer, tell me. If it's better, tell me. Or, you know... don't. I know that none of you will! After all, you're all AVOIDING me, aren't you!? Just admit it!

      There is a farmer who is having problems with his chickens. All of a sudden, they start begging very sick and he doesn't know what's wrong with them. After trying all conventional methods, he calls a biologist, a chemist, and a physicist to see if they can figure out what is wrong. So the biologist looks at the chickens, examines them a bit to find out what the matter is. He says he has no clue. Then the chemist takes some testsand makes some measurements, but he comes to no conclusions either. Finally the physicist tries. He stands there and looks at the chickens for a long time without touching them. All of a sudden he starts scribbling away in a notebook. After several gruesome calculations, he exclaims, "I've got it! But it only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum."  I miss Dr. Jak. Those of you who know what I'm talking about...well, you know.   Now, don't wet yourselves or have a conniption- but there are only 50 school days left!  *Runs around laughing maniacally* Ahem. YAY!!!!!!!!!!!  We're SO close!!!!  Jordy and I decided yesterday that we have to have chalk-drawing parties this summer, as well as camp in somebody's backyard. I think we could make these a regular thing... tell me your thoughts. And somebody bloody call me!! I'm bored!

      *Is looking at the stars* Oooh, lots of...airplanes/twinkly red, blue, white stars. You think just American planes have that color scheme for lights? Like, maybe in Mexico they have green in there. Dunno. Isn't it funny that we have the same three colors on our flag that G. Britain does? Almost like we're unoriginal or something. *Ponders and dismisses that* No, no...we're a very original nation, of course. I mean, look at our government... not like anybody else had the idea before Jefferson, etc. *Rolls eyes* And we're so accepting of other cultures and lifestyles, too! We never discriminate against other people in schools, etc- which is exactly why gay marriages have been put on hold. For a little while, I was so proud of our country... thought maybe we actually were making progress. It was probably just a fluke. Why was I not born in England?

You enjoy showing mortals whose in control, and won't hesitate ti hurt someone if they really start to bug you. You are old, and will continue to live for many years more. Longer than any given person. You are agile, quick witted and sharp. You enjoy putting people down, and can communiv=cate with the nights soul, as you do the shadows.  You are an angel that has been cast out of heaven, and thrown to the earth. Almost being killed in the process. But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? And the same rule applies to you. When you suffer, it only makes you more vicious, and powerful. You are an impressive beinf. One never to be trifled with. You hate all normal angels for this. You drink their blood, to get back at the heavens that rejected you.

      Happy St. Patrick's Day! Woohoo, so... overall, it was a good day. However, I became aware of just how... filthy the human race is. So, that made the day seem a little less bright.. and green. Happy Green Day! HA! *Pauses* Now that everyone gets my pun, probability fair was fun. Fun, fun. Uhm, Film Festival was awesome. I'm totally going next year. But yeah, rant- humans. First off, green Day. Says something about human nature. Out of mere tradition and slight fear (see pinching), a nation may be persuaded to wear green on one day of the year, and pinch those who do not. Honestly, what a society of conformists! I cannot speak- I wore a green feather boa. My neck, you'll all be happy to know, has returned to its natural color; I am no longer the leprechaun of DOOM!!! w/ FEATHERS!! ERm, yeah. I've stopped shedding green feathers. Soo, the darker side- the holocaust. (Told ya it was darker). Anyway- thousands of people die because they are seen as inferior. Everyone finds death camps and whatnot appalling. But... you must realize, this sort of thing has been going on since Day 1. Humans will always look for a way to promote themselves at the cost of other. On a lesser scale than death and war- hierarchies. They're bloody everywhere! Some might argue that the US is free of them, and I would say that is total bullshit. The upper-middle class... if that's not hierarchy, I don't know what is. Schools have it... labelling, it's often called. It's mimicking the outside world of classes. That is why there will never be a perfect society. People feel the need to have that arrogance, even if it is unfounded- and at the cost of thousands of lives of people who you see as below you. Honestly, what will this lead to? We'll all end up killing ourselves, certainly. Everyone looks back on the Holocaust, thinking of how horrible, how terrible... what sort of evil demons, monsters could do this? We've moved on...we've learned from the mistakes of the past. But... it wasn't so long ago. In fact, that is ridiculously recent history. Obviously no one learns from mistakes made 60 years ago, much less 200 or so. Thus, it is only fitting to assume and conclude that our own very nature, that which has at times both held us back and progressed us to where we stand today- shall be the very death of us all.

      Today, my internet decided to not work. So, right now, I'm dialed up. For a time there, I couldn't get online. It was hell. Do you realize just how much I love the internet, depend on it, live with it. Yes, I'm completely and utterly addicted- everyone knows that. But... dear god! What would I do w/out it!? What would any of us do?? In a very short span of time, our society has become violently dependent upon technology like the internet. Says something about how primitive we've become. I mean, yes, technology is seen as the opposite of being primitive- but everyone was very unhappy because they could use calculators on 2 of the csap math sections. I myself am extremely dependent on my calculator... not for every little function, but just for security. Few people write letters anymore- we keep in touch through instant messages and email. I prefer making plans over the internet as opposed to phone- more people at once, you know? What are we coming to? What if, one day, we lose all electricity. ALL of it. We'd go to bed with the sun, to say the least. Think about that. What would you do w/out everything electric, and eventually battery-powered as well.

      The strive for perfection can fall under a Self category. I've discovered it! You see, not everything is necessarily done in self-interest. No... because some things are done "for the greater good." This leads me to one's self. Everything is done from one person's perspective. Everything is done in the views of every person. So, everything roots back to the Self. The End! Yay!

It'll have philosophy, psychology, analytical writing, and... maybe I'll throw in some architecture and paintings! Yes, indeed!   The bit on human nature needs revising. It happens, you know... gotta keep throwing out ideas and debating them w/ yourself. Human Nature:  Sought Perfection Self-Interest   Give me a situation, I'll give you one of two categories.

      Shit. I was hoping for rain. But the way the clouds are covering the mountains right now means snow. *Sigh* I hate that the weather can have this effect on me! Oh well.   I meant to do human nature- so, I've been working on this. I'll elaborate later, maybe... but all things humans do are rooted in two things: Self-Interest- cliche, yes, but true- includes promote the species Separatism- this includes such sub-categories as power-hunger and some violence

      I spent the better part of my day indoors. Doing nothing. So come early evening, I was getting rather... antsy, shall we say. Monotony! Oh, it eats away at me everyday. I can feel it pulsing through my ears, across my eyes... dulling everything. So I got to thinking how I can't wait for my friends get licences. There's nothing like driving around w/ friends, no adults... even in silence. It's isolated, peaceful. It's got this beautiful feeling of independence. Camping under the stars sounds ridiculously appealing right now, too. Again, without parents/adults. Going to a concert, a good one... and just screaming and dancing and worshipping and singing. Hmm, or I feel (felt, rather, but whatever.. still feel, kinda) like going on a date. That electric thrill of slight touch, gnawing curiosity of unknown thoughts, glances and smiles... a caffeine high. I want to be hyper at the drop of a pin again. I used to have that power. Just being in the right company would make me laugh until it hurt, give me that creative inspiration for countless unnamed works. *Sigh* What happened? High school, maybe. New people, fewer people in large numbers. Lack of change overall, perhaps, surrounded by constant change. We keep ending up where we all began. And Ashley needs something new. Something to break this pattern. In a good way. I want to go somewhere completely secluded and scream as loud as I can. That one just came to me. I feel trapped, a bit. Paralyzed. I'm perfectly capable of movement, but not internally. Like.. my psyche is caught in a web right now. I feel like biting someone's neck... hmm. Luckily, school takes my mind off of this. Only problem is, school  is  the web. The paralysis. The bindings. And I can't break free, walk again, until I'm fully bound and motionless. I have to hit bottom.... or perhaps it's top, before I can feel free again... at all. For some people, I see that this never happens. They strive their entire lives for something unattainable. When in fact what they need is attainable and right in front of them. I should take my own advice. I should just enjoy the right now and right here. Pretend I'm somewhere else and am wishing to simply be alone in my room with my thoughts. I'm not unhappy, by any means. And happiness is just a state of mind. So I'm content.   *note- human nature next rant*

        CSAPs. Why?! Stupid Bill Owens, who does NOT take good pictures (those of you who are not politically conscious, he's our governor- and he's got a stupid little smirk that never leaves his face... such an insincere Rep. look, if you ask me... not that you did) [see  urlLink Pic 1 ,  urlLink Pic 2 , and the worst-  urlLink Pic 3 ], made it so that schools who do well get more money. Judged by standardized testing, of course. Not that schools get money anyway- see fundraisers, if you disagree. Now, if a school does well, we can assume that it has good teachers. And if it has good teachers, it's able to pay these teachers. You shouldn't reward already-wealthy schools for their wealth! C'mon! Common sense! You should give money to schools who don't do so well, and who need the money for better teachers and supplies, etc. It's like giving tax cuts to the upper class. They're not bloody well gonna put the money back into the economy. Not like Bush wants. If anything you give tax cuts to the poor who 1) NEED it, and 2) are  guaranteed  to use it. Honestly! Tax cuts to those who don't need it. Damn republicans. I mean, I know they're people too... they have feelings just like the sensible people do. But they don't have any common sense or decency!!   Back to CSAPs. And if we do well, what do we, the students, get in return. The money doesn't directly affect us. We're not getting paid. We don't have any say in how the money is used. But we do all the work. Yes, the teachers teach us what's on the tests, but they're getting paid. And they're not being challenged. We are. We're forced to sit for hrs upon hrs, working towards what goal? Better conditions for a school we'll only see for 2 more years. It doesn't even help us move on in life- transcript-wise. What's the bloody point? Of course, I do give it my all... but that's me and tests. I'm just saying, there should be some payoff for giving up a full hr of extra sleep on Wed. morning to go to school and take a bunch of tests all week that don't even benefit me. I should really pull one of those damn exam jokes. Like refusing to answer on the basis that offends my religion or something. Ask if you want me to send them to you, I've got them all in an email. Very funny stuff.

But it's still Friday. And I'm going to see the mall tomorrow, whom I have not seen in a while. And whom I miss. However, I have to meet a new person tomorrow and meeting new people intimidates me. It's the introvert in me. At least the snow's not sticking yet. I mean... it will. And there'll be ice cuz it just rained. But... well, you know. Maybe rain water is salty. *Crosses fingers*

        You belong in another of my worlds. The world of self-destructive tendencies, either through actual physical destructiveness or emotional breakdowns that you keep bottled up inside, thus hurting yourself. You feel that life is nothing but pain, and you see red in everything with the memories of the blood you have bled(literally or figuratively) for your hurting. You live in a hidden land that few will ever understand or see in you, because you keep it to yourself and only let a few rare people into the truth of your reality. Er...I don't condone my own actions, so I really don't know what else to say.

      For those of you who are perhaps in the dark for whatever reason- tomorrow is the day before May Day (aka Arbor Day, I discovered glancing at a calendar). Traditionally, May Day (Beltaine) is a big holiday with lots of celebration, loss in inhibition, and a-maying in the woods. People would take off their wedding rings (and all implications that go w/ it). Heh, so you can imagine how we want to celebrate such a marvelous holiday- as there aren't any nearby woods to go a-maying in, we decided long ago to celebrate in a different way. Tomorrow, be as perverted as it is possible for you to be. In other words, make innuendos out of everything, perverted jokes, kinky references, gestures-  everything . And have fun w/ it, cuz it's gonna be a fun day! Hehehehe, I cannot wait.

      HAhahahaha, the IRONY! She is not there to teach us to memorize textbooks, however she says this: "I just go by what the book says." Indeed, Ms. Null, indeed you do! You absolutely  live  by the book! There is not room for interpretation in your narrow little world of books, not even interpretation of one word (O-bloody-MIT!). You do not believe in such low things as creativity because, seeing as you have none yourself, why should anyone else use theirs?! Life should be fair like that, shouldn't it, Ms. Null? Life should all be run by books. You sadden me with your narrow-mindedness. It is almost sickening; I pity those authors you live by- they were masters of abstract, of creation, of ART- and you have the audacity, the ignorance, to slander their work, their art, by claiming there is no room for interpretation. God forbid anyone  use  their mind should it challenge your own. It has never been more apparent to me or certainly anyone else that Null is no more than an editor... one who corrects others. She is not a creator, she is not a writer. She is no artist! She simply edits by the book. Teachers should inspire, if you ask me. They should be artists; it is a craft, a trade, to teach someone. To teach is to be abstract, as a teacher works raw concepts into minds. She is not abstract. What irony! Just goes by what the books says indeed!    Tell me you're not simply tickled by this- "Iraq increasingly is a political problem for Bush as he faces re-election; more than half of Americans disapprove of his handling of the situation."*    *"Bush Critical of Spanish Leader" in the Daily Camera on the 20th.   Hehehe, that tickles me. Maybe Kerry stands a real chance... let's hope people don't go all stupid and have the attitude of "but he led our country so well after 9-11!" He didn't do a shitload to find Osama once the focus was on Saddam. Honestly, Americans can be so stupid and ignorant.

      I'm so terribly sorry, Brady (no I'm not, don't listen), but I'm going to have to copy your idea and post my own modest proposal. It's political... if that bothers anyone, shut up and don't comment. No one cares ... you  unaffiliated  person!  A Modest Proposal of National Reform By Ashley Steele  	Permit me to introduce myself prior to unveiling my ideas for reform. I am a scholar of sorts, a lover of art and beauty, and passionately am a political philosopher. Being a person of good logic, the political affiliation of liberalism and I go naturally hand in hand. Countless hours have I spent scrutinizing the relationship between human nature and a society of the masses (government), whether a forced correlation or not. It is on this note that I introduce a societal crisis that gnaws at the very core of my heart: conservatism. For nearly 200 years, this plague has wormed its way into the minds of decent Americans, moving the country into a trend of spiraling downward. Over the years, this political ideal emerged in front of the public in the form of the Republican Party. The followers of this party, clearly seduced by charismatic orators and authority figures (vaguely reminiscent of Adolf Hitler, who was a conservative), have preposterous ideas about lacks of freedom imposed on others, self-interest, and violence. Should this powerfully delicate nation fall into the hands of conservatives and those who lead them many more times, not only will Americans feel the brunt of this evil, but the entirety of the developed and developing world will suffer.  	My solution to this obstacle is fairly simple should one look at it logically. To begin with, media of all sorts (ie television, movies, internet, and advertisements everywhere) should henceforth be required to include subliminal messages. These messages, tested extensively by professionals and proven effective, must in some way convey to the observer that conservatism is wrong. Companies should be urged to include messages about seeking help for this terrible problem. Liberal messages are also recommended, though they are not required. Dear reader, you may have noticed the main flaw in this initial step towards a better, safer world. The media does not reach everyone. To this argument I respond with the fact that these people who do not come in contact with media of any kind are not voters. They are not political figures or intellectuals, spewing absurd policies and ideas. Not reached by media of any sort, these people pose no threat to the cause.  	Next in this process is, of course, re-educating the public. If you, my readers, have ever spoken to a republican, you might have noticed his or her lack of education. In this case, I am not necessarily referring to a formal education, as it is rare to find a first or secondary school that teaches logic or politics. Thus, this nation’s educators must train in these subjects so that they might teacher the leaders of tomorrow how to think about politics and other life matters logically (ie liberally). Open-mindedness should be more strongly enforced early in life, as this is when minds are most easily molded. We, as a country, must eliminate the close-minded views of conservatives from people of all ages.  	In order to eliminate the conservative crisis, we must finally provide help to all those troubled minds who must be educated but are, perhaps, beyond school institutions. Psychologists, trained in liberal matters, should be accessible to all people of this beautiful country. Patients must be helped using whatever means necessary, including, but not limited to, the following methods: intensive counseling and therapy, hypnosis, shock therapy (using positive/negative reinforcement methods), and lobotomies (to be applied to formerly radical conservatives, political figures, etc.). Clearly, the formerly stated methods are the only way to enlighten and inform the masses of conservatives rampant amongst normal people.  	In the past, many solutions have been sought out to this governmental and societal calamity. Human nature, in regards to Communism, a valid idea of a Utopian society, is the demise of the idea. Socialism, implemented by many societies throughout history, creates public strife and from it emerge power-hungry dictators (completely undermining the system). Any sort of monarchy or dictatorship, even constitutional, has its problems. While there is a loyalty, there is no feeling of pride in having chosen a leader. In the United States, the ideals of Capitalism are inherent in the system of government. There is constant competition between liberals and conservatives, and because of this there is a huge split in what could be a unified country. Getting rid of the other party would create a feeling of nationalism, patriotism, and unity among citizens. Assassination of political officials is out of the question, certainly, as there is always someone next in line for the presidency. All other ideas and systems have failed.  	Make no mistake about me, dear reader. I hold no grudge against any conservative; they are all products of bad education, environment, and ignorance. However, I will not let this stop me pushing for a better community for my loved ones and myself to live in, a better country for future generations, and a peaceful world. I have examined every aspect of this thoroughly, and there is not a single flaw. No other solution has worked in the past, nor will anything less than what I have suggested ever succeed. This is for the benefit of all people, present and future. Let us evolve as a species; let us make progress in human intelligence. I beg of you to consider this flawless idea- if not for yourself, do so for those you love.

      So over the past 6ish months, I've been getting really into the whole college search thing. What maddens me, however, is that I have no top choices- CU is my fallback school, as it's a good school, but I know I could get in w/out trying. Other than that, I don't have any real ideas- I wanna go to a well-known school... a selective one. In a suburban setting. But besides that, I have no clue. I mean, I've ruled out a few states and cities I don't wanna go to... I just wish I had some goal. Some selective school to visit and aspire to. I got this book thing in the mail (I get lots of college mail), and it says competative schools, when looking at your transcript, expect, if offered, 4+ AP courses or 7+ Honors courses. Now I'm trying to remember, is level 4 of a language  weighted , or is it actually AP? Anyone know?

So I look a bit closer and it's an earwig! UUUUuuuuuRRRRGGG!!! And then right next to it, right next to my foot, I realized, was another one. I am NOT a sqeamish person, but *whimper* I cannot take earwigs. They are my weakness, you might say... I would sooner take spiders over earwigs. I absolutely detest them, they scare the shit out of me. Irrational? Yes. But when has that ever stopped anyone?

       FREEDOM in the United States of America.     Land of the free, and the home of the brave. Disregarding the fact that this little phrase makes us sound like arrogant bastards, I'd like to rant a bit on the first part. Americans take pride in being free to do whatever the fuck they want to whenever it tickles their fancy. Unless this fancy that's being tickled doesn't tickle the majority. Beside the point, though, right? Nope. The entire point. That's not freedom. That's like thinking  inside  the box, and being proud of it. We are caged. Yes, from what we can see, we are less caged than many other countries, etc. Doesn't matter. We're completely and utterly egocentric anyway. It's funny, we live in an imperfect government, society, country... all that. And we decide to go after something that is perfect in theory (ie Communism). It's a utopic society, and we feel the need to impose our own Capitalistic, self-interested views on others. I hate this; I hate this separation of ideals. It's so completely stupid and moronic! WE ARE ALL HUMAN.   But still, we feel the need to promote ourselves or those who will benefit us. We can't see beyond our own noses. We are NOT empathetic beings as a whole. The id, if you will, is constantly telling us to do what will best benefit ourselves. Sometimes I just hate the human race as a whole. SAME fucking species, and the way I see it, we're gonna have to put aside differences at some point. Why not do so now, make things a bit more peaceful? We're all gonna end up dying together anyway. May as well unite. I actually don't believe in Communism; it limits arts and individualism, and I'm all about that. Honestly, if humans weren't so bloody violent *PUN*, a lack of government would be the best way to go. As it is, we are.   And just as I was writing that, I've had an epiphany. Violence stems from fear. You see it in all species, it's natural. However, humans have evolved to be more violent because we have in fact devolved. We can no longer depend ourselves. I mean, you put a carnivorous animal that hasn't eating in a week and a human in a room together, who do you think will win? Any normal human would freak out, and not be able to defend themself. And this is exactly why humans are so violent- they are fucking terrified because they're defenseless. It's a desperation sort of thing, which has become part of their nature. HAH! I love epiphanies. I could also argue that because the US has so much fear (watch the news and look for some really good, uplifting news), we've devolved even further than the rest of the world. However, I know better, because the US is a very new country. 400 years from now is a different story.   *Sorry I switched in and out of being a human spectator to actually being human. And yes, my writing is NOT concise, and I fucking well like it that way, thank you very much, Ms. Null. Ms. Zero. Ms.  NOTHING .  *** You know what I find ridiculously amusing? During that socratic (I'm afraid only a couple people who might read this were in my class at the time), we led it better than she ever has. Notice that all the conversation is totally forced w/ her stupid prompts? Yet with us, it just flowed...we came up with our own topics and never let the conversation flow die. Makes you wonder what it would be like to just have classes like that, without the DICTATOR. Indeed. The best of her classes was when we led it, basically.

      K, so before I retire, I've thought of something lovely to blog.    The End of the Human Race   I would like your opinions/responses via tagboard, so you know.   It becomes increasingly obvious the older I get that the human race, our species, is DOOMed *snerk *. We are going to kill our own species. This I know without a single doubt. However, the way in which we do this remains mystery. So I figured I'd list a few possibilities.   1) Over-use of antibiotics. Yes, I've been paying too much attention in bio, so shoot me. These drug-resistant pathogens are going to multiply and be created exponentially. Eventually, they will outrun us... we won't have the technology, the time, the money, etc. to defeat these little buggers, and they're going to create some 2nd plague. Only this time, it won't be Europe alone. What I discovered recently, something of which I was not aware, there were people who were immune to the black death. Why did no one tell me this?! There is, as I see it, a solution to this end. It isn't a pretty one, however, and the government and people everywhere would have my head for even suggesting it. Eliminate all unnatural disease-stoppers. Antibiotics, drugs, medicines.... the lot. Then natural selection takes place, weeding out the weak ones (yes I realize this sounds horrible, cuz billions would die... but it'll happen eventually anyway) and give our species a chance to survive. Immunity would be built and we would evolve to be a much stronger species. It would take much time, of course, but... if we don't do that, eventually we'll all be without immune systems one day.   2) An obvious one- nuclear war. None of this.... it's ridiculous. People are far to moronic and primitive to hold such power as this. Just... no. No war. Too much death, no one wins.  3) Over-population and exhaustion of resources. We can see it now, already. You look at places like China, India (which will soon overrun China for most populace country, and it's a good deal smaller)... poverty, all that wretchedness. I sound like a horrible person again, but for a solution, see #1.   4) Global Warming. Idiot Bush decided that no, it was too costly to cut back on the amount of carbon dioxide our country releases into the atmosphere.... *sigh* Sooner he's out of office and we get a liberal in ... or at least a liberal conservative... the better. Anyway, global warming is a fact, it is not a theory... it's not even far-fetched. There is solid evidence. Anyway, this is the basis... and mind you, our generation may very well live to see this begin. It already has, really. Glaciers, icecaps... all of it starts to melt, slowly at first then faster after a few years of increased heat. Places like Italy, Florida, lots of CA, Louisianna, and a good deal of Europe (not bothering to look at a topography map) will be under water very quickly. Massive migration, emigration... panic. Panic creates riots, etc. People go inland so quickly, there's no chance for a market to stablize. No jobs, no houses... overcrowding. Few possibilities in a situation like this... someone could see the opportunity in all this turmoil to take control and shut people up, thus becoming a very, very powerful dictator... more than one, actually, as this will be happening all over the world. OR people will realize the uselessness of government and overthrow it. Complete lack of freedom or anarchy. Either way, chaos... disrest. Lots of people will die in conflicts during this period of time, I'm assuming. We will have lost a lot of land, of course... resources. Possible outlets of oil. Starvation due to various factors, including lack of organization in gov't and otherwise as well as lack of food itself.    Ashley has run out of ideas. Let me know if you think of anything else, and your opinions on these 4. Toodles.

      *Sigh* True to form, my mother gave me a lovely lecture today when I got home... because I have a bloody C in Mainland's... which I don't plan on keeping. She seemed to think, last time this was brought up, that I was cruising my way through that class. If I did such a thing, I would be failing. But of course, I am not failing. I am average. Which, in parent language, means failing. After all, since we're all advanced students and whatnot, each of us has to be the best... average, even in a college level class, is unacceptable. Urg! It's just never good enough. If I'm happy with a B, she ask me why I don't have an A. I have never gotten a C in any other class, because I DO NOT cruise through classes! I have a fucking 4.1 GPA... I'd say that's a bit above shooting for average. But it's not enough. It's never enough.

      I will admit it, I am very very susceptible to beauty and my ideas of perfection.... and frankly this painting made me tear up because it... it amazes me what william-adolfe bouguereau could do. Such real features, but it's... perfect in a certain way that I can't describe. Look up his work, especially if you've got my fetish for oil paintings.  ~~>   urlLink Painting.

       How would you feel if someone emailed you a critical letter and didn't  have the decency to discuss their concerns with you face to face?   Please give your teachers the same respect you would want for yourself.    Also, I cannot help you if I don't know who you are.  Other emails of  this type will be deleted without being opened.    -- Ms. Null    BITCH! What if I was completely embarassed to face her, and now I'm terrified of my teachers. Honestly... that wasn't nice, she totally missed my point. The point was that this is how everyone feels, not just me... it's not just me w/ these concerns.

      I'm thinking that perhaps sometimes stress is a good thing, as it prevents one from being like ME! All my stress evaporated after the AP test, but that's bad cuz then I didn't feel like completing projects or studying for finals. I'm a bit worried, now. Ok, I'm scared shitless. Someone save me!

      So, big news of today. Was in Mainland's class (I'm going to miss it SO much! *tear*), and we were watching Eddie Izzard. Funniest thing, I was in stitches... omg, I have to see the rest of it. Sooo hilarious. So, everyone was so absorbed in that wonderful standup comedian, that no one noticed the faint sound of a fire alarm going off in the distance... or the quickly permeating smell of smoke. Until someone pointed out the faint noise, and we stepped outside to find mass amounts of thick smoke. Turns out someone decided to burn a recycle box right outside of Mainland's room. Also turns out people are much more leisurely about getting out of a building when there's danger, as opposed to a drill when you're in danger only of being stampeded. Crazy humans. But it was exciting, I suppose.

      Hmm, what news? Saw Shrek 2, was hilarious. Went to BBQ, was awesome fun but I got soooo sore from head-banging to Turoke, I think it is. They were an awesome band. Erm... Bush fell off his bike. He was mountain biking on his TX ranch (first off, what mountains?) w/ the secret service (can't you see his posse of them on bikes) and his personal physician (on a bike ride??? C'mon... paranoid much?). Oh but don't worry, he only got a few cuts, and his physician... who was in the bike riding posse, cleaned him up (did he have his first aid kit along?) and he finished the ride. In response, I'd like to sum up w/ one word: What?   Erm, yeah... that's about it. Looking forward to summer and Harry Potter. Bye, loves.

      I fixed it! Definitely easier to read... and I really like the pic. It's another of that same artist, called L'art et la litterature, I believe.   Yay! So, first I tried out a new skin and it was FUCKED up! I tried to put in varying degrees of black to blue to gray backgrounds, all were some shade of green. I know Kaitlin likes her work, but if you go to blogskins.com, I really don't recommend MayStar. Her codes are off or something.

      I have some advice for everyone.   Go see Troy. ASAP.   It was.... EPIC!   My gods, I'm still flustered about it. When the Greeks attack first, and the ships... and when the priestess plunges the knife deep into Agamemnon's throat... and Achilles vs. Hector, both of whom I grew to be fond of... gods, it was epic. Go see it. You won't regret it. Although, I believe the whole thing lasted little over a fortnight, and obviously the Trojan War was 10 years. Anyway, it was brilliant. No gods, but that was okay, because it was realistic. And... woooooooo.

      Well, whatever. We're sticking with it for now. Listen, I'm kinda perturbed at Null for giving us so little time for book reading and write-ups. Anyone gonna write to her, cuz I'm not gonna do it again, she'd recognize my style, etc. She just needs to be bitched at. She's getting too cocky again, we need to keep her down a bit, if you know what I mean. Bye, loves.

      I am trying to decide on some background. The lightning one made things hard to see, much as I loved it. Thank gods, it has ceased snowing for now. Anyway, currently we are experimenting with Bougeureau's Dante something or other. I'm in one of those moods where this is very appealing. I'm gonna stick w/ his stuff for a while because 1) He's my favorite artist EVER, and 2) Right now these paintings are sort of moving me. That's the effect they have, it's profound. Please tell me if you like it/hate it/are bothered by the color choices.

      It was brought to my attention how sparsely I've been posting lately, and I apologize. It's just that I don't have a lot to talk about... life is kinda boring in a studious-for-the-AP-test sort of way. Hmm, what could I talk about... actually I can think of something, but I REALLY don't wanna offend anybody. But whatever, it's my blog... and you've been warned, it pertains to religion.     So... mythology. When I think of Christianity and all those product religions of it, I am brought to mythology. Like the myth of Danae, whose son was prophesized to overthrow King something-or-other. He locked his maiden daughter in a tower or some other isolated place away from suitors. Zeus impregnated her with a "shower of gold" or a ray of light... however you want to interpret that. She gave birth to this great hero, Perseus. Funny, the parallels w/ the virgin Mary. Hmmm. Another thing... Eros. God of Love (had wings, bow and arrow... equivalent = Cupid). He had these cronies called amorettes or cupids, whatever... they had wings and carried bows and arrows, but through art, etc., eventually they lost the weaponry. Cherubs... religious; fat toddlers w/ wings... sometimes carrying bows and arrows. And angels... these beautiful winged anthropomorphic creatures, other wordly, though sometimes they appear before mortals. Sound a lot like gods, no? Is anyone else seeing these terribly vague and hardly distinguishable similarities, or is it just me?   My point is, of course, that Christianity (and those similar to it) is nothing more than modern-day mythology. We've just downsized the pantheon, that's all. Now, generally speaking, the ancient gods are pretty much dead in the minds of people today. Mythologies; religions... die. They are ways to explain the world around us... crazy things like the weather, death, and existence. As humans evolve and logic progresses (erm... kinda), we have a new sort of explanation for the world around us. Science. We have creation stories (theories), and  logical  reasons for things that most anyone would understand and accept in other circumstances.   Now, this is not totally dissing religion... I think it is a marvelous thing to have good teachings. I think more people should pay attention to overall messages about love and acceptance, etc. Rules are rather ridiculous... people change, rules should change with them. I mean, look at history. Teachings, though, are good. And hope, and faith in some reasoning behind everything... if it helps you to survive another day, I'm all for it. But not dogma... not hatred induced by teachings of love, of interpretations of stupid rules. Personally, I'm not 100% atheist as I sound. I strongly, strongly believe in reincarnation. Different from organized religion, however... I do not follow rules that have been around for way too long and people simply blindly accept. That would be like our society suddenly declaring that no one is allowed to wear clothes, and no one really questioning it, even when it's cold. This is really just a huge rant, but yeah... I believe in reincarnation, cuz I  know  about many of my previous lives. I've known many of you before, I'm positive. That is what my logic tells me... that is why London is my home, though I've never been there. *Shrug* I like to think I'm a rather perceptive person, and that's why I can "remember" certain things... like deja vu and dreams and... sometimes my interest is completely sparked on a certain subject in history, and somehow it's completely familar, though I know nothing about it- like the Black Death. Well, I'm going to bed... so I might get sleep this week before Wed. Nighty night

      Oh. My. Gods. Go see Fahrenheit 9/11. It's the most intense, funny, truthful film... made me kinda furious w/ the Bush admin., but the audience was so excellent... I kept scoffing at Bush, and I wasn't alone. And everybody clapped SO loud afterwards. It was very inspiring. I just hope it sways a few independents to vote dem.

      READ ALL OF IT! NOW.  Erm, so it's tomorrow now *diverts eyes, avoiding contact* and so... Boston. Took a midnight flight there and unfortunately got the back row. Now you might think nothing above a simple inconvenience for getting drinks and off the plane, but it was far worse, my loves. You see, in the backmost row of a United airplane, one is not able to recline. Consider now that when flying Denver to Boston, you jump ahead a few hours. So, we arrived after a 4 hr flight in Boston at 6 in the morning; I got about 1.5hrs of sleep that night, which was fun... ahh, one of the first things we sought out in Boston was Boston Common and Public Garden. Stunning bit of old in the middle of the city. I liked the old mixed in w/ new in the city, very nice to get a glimpse of the old world. So that day saw the Atlantic, as you would in a plane, went on my first subway ride (the T) to Northeastern University. Not superb, but they had a neat little food place that I could see myself frequenting (later saw it downtown as well). Called The Wrap, and they got points on the inhabitants... and yes I'm being entirely shallow, but there was a very, very hot guy in The Wrap. Sort of appallingly godly beautiful. Too tall, though. Saw Cambridge and Harvard, and I liked the area and campus was gorgeous. Cambridge is the perfect cute little college town, and I really like that environment, so Harvard is good.   Crashed at 7 that night, and I was struggling to keep my eyes open at that point. Next day, went to Boston University (BU). It's nice, but it's right between 2 big streets and it's still urban. And Ashley doesn't like urban, cuz... it smells like exhaust and there's too much noise. Then, went to.... Boston College! Which, like Harvard so far on the trip as you're hearing it, is a list-topper. Beeaaautiful campus, and I could tell the town was good- Newton is the 2nd safest town in the country, so that's something. The tour and info was excellent and ... I really liked the feel of campus. Just one thing wrong- it's a Jesuit school, which means approx. 70% of their students are Catholic, so not much spiritual diversity. But, I've also heard Jesuits are some of the most progressive Christian-types and so that's something to be said for the staff.   Day 3- Got a car (it was white, bleeeh) and started the drive to W. Mass. On the way was Brandeis, and might I say it was a hellish time getting there and the campus was ugly and not worth the stress navigating. It was made recently... and it's just not a nice campus. And it's in the middle of no where. I thought it would be a list-topper. It isn't. So, got to Amherst around lunchtime... the surprising thing about New England is how little time it takes to get around. Amherst is a very cute little town complete w/ cool cafes and shops. There was a guy w/ blue hair and a girl in the common petitioning or something to "Help beat Bush in November." If only I could vote. So before we met a friend of the family for lunch, had a chance to check out Amherst College. It's a small place, but very nice... and I really liked the town. And this is accredited to more than just the stop sign that said STOP bush, which was amusing. After a terribly uneventful lunch with a college professor at Hampshire College in S. Amherst (my stepdad's a professor at CU, we have grad student/professor friends), we checked out Hampshire. Uhm...no. It's next to... a field. And a farm. And it had ugly little buildings. No.   That afternoon we also looked at UMass Amherst. It looked nice, it was sort of out of the way, so I would obviously need a car (to go to any college in Amherst, really). It was a nice campus, though... but it didn't necessarily have that right feel, the spark, you know? Well, maybe you know. So for sleeping, we had a room in this old inn called the Black Walnut Inn. It was the NICEST place I have ever stayed... and the Omni in New Orleans was very high class. But this old house had been converted to an inn at some point, and the current owners made it more...modern, shall we say, while leaving antiques and hints of what it used to be. Huge room, it was bigger than many flats. And just really nice. One of the owners, the husband, showed us around and it felt more like I was a guest at someone's house rather than at a hotel w/ those bloody pompous concierges who keep grinning at you and checking you out... urg. Didn't like the hotel the first two nights in Boston... *shudder*. Anyway, the homey feeling was reinforced by the breakfast element... the husband (I forgot his name) gets up everyday about 6:30-7 and cooks breakfast for everybody...whatever you want. And good food... like, homemade bread, etc. Really excellent, and met an interesting couple at the dining table. Newlyweds who looked to be late 60s, early 70s. It was the woman's first marriage.   Anyway, it was terribly unfortunate, but we had to leave that lovely bed & breakfast early to go to Connecticut. So, first on the agenda was Storrs- UConn. It's another rural one... it's got some nearby stuff, but it's actually in the woods. Nice campus though, very...sleek. You can tell they're devoted to basketball. Unfortunately, they're considered the 2nd most homophobic college/univ. in the nation... after my fav. basketball team, Duke. Anyway, after Storrs was Middletown... which was excellent, reminded me of a little Boulder. Very nice. The architecture was beautiful, I think I got a few pics of their psych. building, which was... woooo. And their field was... it was so nice. Very suburb area, which is great. So then we left for RI, in which the drivers are crappy.   We had a beachfront room, which was a nice view... excellent. The room was crappy, though. It's the oldest inn in the area, and it had nice cars in both of its lots, so you'd think it'd be nicer. Nope. The bed felt about as soft as bricks... I'm certain the bathroom tiles were originally beige or at least gray, not black and dark brown in spots. We did have a balcony, which was good, I suppose. Of course... not much credit can be given an inn that doesn't even offer a phone jack or phone in its rooms. *Shrug* That was our last night... it was cool to be on the beach. Haven't been in ages, and I've touched the Atlantic. I'd never been to the east coast, so that was cool. Although the water was freezing. I started out making a sand gothic building but decided on more of a statuey sculpture. It started out as some random bird and turned into a dove. I was too low, though- high tide got it. Brown U. is in Providence; it is, of course, Ivy League... but Providence is  entirely  an industrial city, and it looks it... scarred by factory smokestack looking places. It's not pretty. And I would leave my dorm everyday and find myself exclaiming, quite involuntarily, "Eeeaaauurrrgghhh! Oh, it's still ugly!" And I would never make it to class on time, having to take shelter from the sights of the city in my dorm. So, Brown's off my list. And... then we went to the airport and got a flight a couple hrs early.   Oh yes, flight home... we weren't back row, thank gods. But I was seated next to the in-flight weirdo. He was about 7' tall, so he felt the need to stretch a bit before sqeezing himself between united seats (horribly small, even I think so). I can understand, although 2 minutes after the fasten seatbelt sign is on... I thought was a bit excessive. A few minutes into the flight, he hisses to himself "Fuck! *mutter* Shit... aww fuck." He kept giving scandalized looks to the seat in front of him since the woman in it had decided to exercise her right to recline. He got up a couple times to pace around the plane... only to sit down and a few minutes later exclaim quitely "Fuck!" Yet again to himself, unprovoked. He pulled out his own food, which seemed to be aging seafood... smelled like crap, anyway, and mind you the smell of fish doesn't get to me, so... whatever it was... Anyway, that's about it. I finished Da Vinci Code today, and I recommend Angels & Demons and DV Code to everybody. Both are great, but I'm biased towards A&D cuz I read it first. Bye for now, Loves.

      So, 'tis summer now... I've seen Lord of the Rings3 twice and Harry Potter once, twice tomorrow. But I have been trapped indoors. (Funnily enough, I'm still getting more tan by the day... funny how that works). So, yes. I'm bored. This is bad, because I'm only a few days in. Meh, hope it changes. Jordy said she had forgetten how sticky summer was, and she's quite right. I do love the season, but the heat is so oppressive sometimes. Meh. It'll be good to get out of the house for the day tomorrow. Oh, I'm about a third through Angels and Demons, and I strongly, strongly recommend it. It's all about religion vs science and logic vs faith. It's excellent- really great plot. Off to read, toodles.

      AHHH!!! Such a packed day! I haven't done this much in one day in ages and ages, but... it was fun, and I'm on a bit of a high right now!   So, woke up EARLY- 8. Fam came over at 9:30 (I could've slept in till 8:30!!!!). Ate homemade waffles, after ages and ages of "Do you have a hat? Do you have a water bottle? Are you wearing bug spray? Do you have a sweatshirt? Okay, kid #2, same questions..." And then turning the car around for more water, we finally were on the way to Mesa Trail Head. We hiked for maybe an hour and a half, when Megan, Lauren, and Marilyn (another cousin, my step aunt's sister's daughter, about 13) crashed in a shady spot and wouldn't move. Deirdre, David, Mark, and I were ready to keep going for another hour, but they were dead behind us, so we turned around. At one point on the hike back, Lauren and I broke into song (the heat?)- First it was Billy Idol, Rebel Yell, then it was Queen- Bohemian Rhapsody. Both excellent songs. Deirdre joined on BR. And then we went to lunch.   The restaurant was called Southern Something, it was in Boulder. It was cool, though. They had games, so Lauren and I tried to play Sorry, but Matthew kept drawing our cards for us and moving our pieces... and so it was very confusing, and he was basically playing w/ himself. And then we tried operation, but he was the bank, and he stole all of our money.... so, yeah. Then Erin started playing by herself, so I gave her all the money in the bank. And we ate, and then Megan decided there should be a drawing contest for the best dragon (naturally I won... actually not naturally, my sister's an artist)- and then they added new categories, like witch and wizard... and mermaid who had a cigar. And weird monster that was called Rum &amp; Beer and had a belt w/ cigars in it... *confusion* And then half the group decided they wanted to go swimming, and Lauren and I stayed home... and then we set up badminton, and played Mark and Matthew. Then Matthew got REALLY frustrated (he bent a racquet banging it on the ground!!), so Mark played us by himself. Had we been keeping points, it would've been about a tie, sadly. And then Matthew broke out the rubberband gun *shudder* and pointed it at everybody. I got shot twice, fortunately just in the back- it wasn't loaded when he was pointing at my face, thank gods!!! That thing scares me. We watched Jurassic Park before everybody else got back.   Sooo, then the other family came over- Kathy's sister's family. Let's see, there was Kris (sp maybe kinda sorta) who was like 17-18, Keith (I'm trying to remember if that was his name definitely or not... I think it was. Maybe) who was 15, very tall, and good at badminton- he was on my team for a long time- they couldn't beat us, lol. That was a lot of fun. And Marilyn who'd already spent the day w/ us. Phew, so after many games of badminton, in which we (Lauren and I, the so-called girly team (Matthew called us that)) won against the boy team- THREE times, lol. It was great. They kept wanting rematches, and we kept beating them. So then dinner, and all the younger people were outside... we kept laughing at Matthew who was both threatening to shoot everyone and saying amusing things. We were all laughing at stuff during dinner, which was awesome.   *Deep breath* And then we all started playing badminton again, but the threat of the rubberband gun was much more real, and Matthew kept just hanging out in the middle of the court. And then we adjourned to the basement, where they were watching Mrs. Doubtfire, a movie I have seen FAR too many times. But now I get all of the  adult  jokes, lol. Hmm, had some icecream, was invited to Estes tomorrow (leaving at 9, ahh!), and then people left. But that's not all! Jordy had called me during Doubtfire, giggling like she was high or something, and so I said I'd call her back when everybody left. I did, but three guys she was hanging out w/ stole her phone, so I talked to them, and that was cool and kinda funny... cuz Jordy was screaming apologies and things about phone sex and rape or something. Lol, and I kept getting different people, so I don't know which conversation goes w/ which person, but whatever. They have my sn if they wanna talk, heh. And so I'm  still  on a natural high... I took a shower, and now I'm here, and my hair is dripping. Busy day, to say the absolute least. But fun.   Update- So, just spent a little while talking to this guy Dane online, who caught my attention most of the guys who stole Jordy's phone. Gave me his cell # and we're gonna try to talk again tomorrow. Hmmm *smirk* We'll see what happens.

      Hello, my loves. So I'm thinking perhaps it's warmer outside than it is in my room, but that's what you get when you live directly over a garage. So, yesterday saw the family... and at first of course it was all weird cuz we hadn't seen them in like 5 years. But then we settled in a bit (there was food), and started talking. Then Lauren, Megan, and I went to the basement... and then Mark joined us and we started a game of yahtzee, then Deirdre and Erin came down and played w/ barbies... Matthew wasn't feeling well, so I barely saw him all evening. It was a bit crazy, what w/ Megan the sadist trying to hurt or yell at her siblings at every opportunity (truly an older sister, she's 14)... and Erin, being 4, has a lot of energy... Mark was rather quiet, but he was giving Lauren advice for&nbsp; yahtzee... which I do anyway, cuz Lauren's not the best, but whatever... he's cool. Matthew is crazy as always, I think he's ADD. Deirdre and Lauren were over, and we all watched Big Daddy - and Brian came over (Deirdre's boyfriend) like halfway though- then the family left, Erin said bye 4 times. So Lauren, Deirdre, Brian, and I finished the movie, making jokes during it and whatnot. It was fun. Seeing them again tomorrow, but this time Kathy's (my step-aunt, I suppose) family is coming over as well. They've got kids more our age- the oldest just finished first year in college, 2 girls and 2 boys. Sooo, we'll see how that goes. Heh, if nothing else, I can always hang out w/ Erin... I thought Megan and I would click, which we sort of did, but you can tell her friends aren't the type of people I would ever hang out w/ and she probably wouldn't go near people like my friends. Soooo, whatever.   Heh, update- so at like 5:30 or something, I walked up to Dede's and she lent me three books... and we hung out there till about 7:30, which was fun- haven't just hung out w/ her for a while. Heh, got three episodes of Queer as Folk from her, so I'll be enjoying those this evening. *Thinks about Brian and Justin* mmmmm... anyway, look how cool I am:      Jaguar Spirit Calls To You!

      So, am a bit disappointed today. Brady and I were supposed to hang out at Borders, and I was looking forward to all the research (I'm a nerd, yes) and stuff, and then he had to push it back for later in the day... and then he never called or emailed. And of course I'm going to be busy w/ family this weekend- in town, haven't seen 'em in years. You know... so not gonna be seeing much of friends till next week. And I'm not in the mood for this weather- I'm in the mood for bright and sunny, not gloomy sprinkle overcast. The rain was good. And now I'm bored and hungry, and it's dinnertime, and they're not calling me down for dinner... and I'm  hungry!  Oh yes, and my toes are cold too... only my left ones though, it's very uneven.

      So, I guess Kaitlin is my only reader now... oh well, whatever. So I must admit my newest, most severe addiction (adding to the long, long, long list)- these bloody Werther's Original hard candies... they taste like toffee. For one thing, they remind me of my childhood for some reason, and also they remind me of toffee... and when I don't have one, I start tasting it, and it's a real addiction. Which is scary, but they're sooo good! They only cost me like 2-something. And I saw Nat working at Walgreens... it was like a glimpse of school lunch. *Sigh* We need to get everybody together for lunch one day. And maybe add in a few more people, who knows. We might just be crazy like that. Okay... hmm, I'll talk about my day, then.  So, woke up and Brady emailed me, and we talked a bit... then at noon Mike picked me up. Went to Borders to say hi to Brady, who was eating at the time *sighs in disappointment* so we hung around for a bit, me listening to this awesome pixies song that I CAnNOT get enough of, nor can I get it out of my head when it's there. Monkey Gone to Heaven, I believe it is...look it up. Whatever, I could point out where it is in the store w/ the headphones- it's track nine. So anyway, then Mike and I drove to Westminister Mall, which was neat cuz I haven't been there in a  long  time (oooh, I just realized I can do italics normally- ctrl + I- neat, sometimes I love blogger), but then we got bored cuz they don't have that many great stores. Actually he agreed to this survey thing for King Arthur... it was... well, weird. They took us to this little room, and the girl asking me questions didn't seem to be able to read simple names... Keira Knightley she pronounced Kara Knight...ley, and then something else. I was like.... okay.... and we didn't get anything in return. It was crazy. So then we went and wandered around Flatirons for a bit, then he took me home, and the garage door was being stupid and the keypad like doesn't work anymore. And of course I don't carry a key... oh well. So I got a hug, then I lazed around a bit... then my mom took me to Walgreens, and now I'm home. I'm onto my 2nd piece of candy since writing this- I'll be back at Walgreens by the end of the week. Oh well, not like they're hugely expensive. Bye, loves!

      Loves... now I'm trying very hard to keep up w/ the blogging, but it's difficult when there's nothing to talk about, but more importantly- no one to talk to. If I don't get comments, I may as well stop blogging (terror of all terrors, quite the tragedy). So pleease comment, just tell me you're reading! That's all! That's all the motivation I need...

      So, I've been doing LOTS of henna... finally made the stuff I got ages ago. The first was rather clumsy, it's a butterfly on my left hand- the 2nd should be okay, I'm unveiling the final project tomorrow morning. Heh, you're excited, aren't you?? I am. That's two intertwined dragons on my inner left ankle.&nbsp;And then I spent way too long on my right ankle- so it's a neat symboly thing at front, then I was like... hmm, Hermes, so I put two large feathered wings wrapping around and going up my ankle. It's pretty neat, I can't wait for that one.   I was obsessing, so I stopped midday today. I had Jordy tell me to stop. But now I wanna do more... oh well. I'm done for today.

      You bloody people... you're constantly changing your blog names. So from now on, blog links are by name... that is all.  &nbsp; The Spark... it's changed. Now it's SparkLife... and it's all Weird! I dunno, whatever.

      Hi, loves. &nbsp; So, today I was really, really, really bored. I stayed up till 3ish last night, so I woke up this morning at about 1. Two people called me today, and I missed one of those calls. *Sigh* I hate this type of day- it's so useless. My head just screams and screams for something to do. I played pinball for about 2 hrs. Ack! Makes me want school to start- and we all know that's insane. Please, people, just call me! And I won't be able to sleep, cuz I've only been awake since 1. Oh well, it's not as if anyone's online anyway. Bye.

      NO FMA!!! *giddy* So, on Sunday... I watched Eddie Izzard all the way through, then my sister got there, so I rewound and we watched the first half together. Monday, I finished the second half. And last night, my other sister and Jordy came over, so we watched it again. Heh, I know most of Dress to Kill by heart now. That's why I need to see his other stuff, but oh well! No FMA threat, I'm finishing Memnoch, Kaitlin and Brady are back, and... I had a donut for breakfast this morning, and I have toffee... and... Deirdre and Brian are coming over for dinner tonight and they're lots of fun, and ... hmm, I still have to finish the movie Troy (which I have, thank you very much), I'm satisfied w/ the drawings I've been doing lately, and... I bought The Vampire Armand today!, and uhm I'm holding Dede and Brady's books (Angels & Demons and Da Vinci Code) hostage- for CASH!!! Erm, or a hug, I haven't decided. Heh, so... to conclude, life is pretty damn good right now. OH! And I got a four on my AP test, and I found a couple colleges that accept World History- CU does! Yay. Happy 14th July!

      The FMA (Fed. Marriage Amendment (no same sex marriages EVER)) didn't go through!!!! They voted against it, they shot it down! Thank gods!! There is hope left for our country after all, Senate had the sense to not take away rights! Maybe our country isn't doomed afterall, just maybe we can see progress! *Prances* I'm so happy now! The FMA got shot down, hehehehehe!

      I can't sleep. I had this horrible revelation as I was laying there in bed- I'm a coward, despite any facades I may present. It's a horrible truth, and what's more- I hadn't realized until now. But I won't go in deeper, I'll just say that I'm probably going to need therapy- granted, it may be self-therapy given my future interests, but therapy just the same. If my father wasn't enough, I have to discover my own personality flaws during bouts of insomnia. Marvelous.   I'm beginning to feel cut off from the world. Days like today madden me, wear what little sanity I have to begin with down. Today I conversed with... my mother, my stepsister, and Bre on the phone. The Bre bit was good, we talked religion- she mentioned something about the end of the world and dragons or something, so I'm going to question that further when we next talk- hopefully this meeting will involve swings and a playground. So, yeah... I feel cut off and I need more contact than that. I'm a bloody Libra, the social butterfly of the zodiac- does no one understand this?! Alas. Well, might be going to see a local band on the 20th- hope so, get to meet this guy Bre likes and get out of the house...where there are people and it's not the mall. Hmm, I feel like my friends rarely introduce me to people they like or are dating. Probably just coincidence... but then I feel so distanced from their rants and I can't give 100% advice when they start freaking out at me.   I've watched Eddie Izzard twice in the past two days. Sad? Yes probably. But I'm learning all the lines of Dress to Kill, so everything is happy. Also sad- I'm beginning to severely miss Mainland's class. I've decided that once I get my AP test scores, regardless of the score itself, I'll bug Mainland via email- either to say 'told you so' or thank him. Those of you reading who were in his class- you're going w/ me at lunch or before/after school to visit him. He really was the best teacher (high school, I'm not dissing Mrs. Bamford or anything) I could've imagined. So, I hadn't really thought about the AP test in ages. It's crazy, cuz that was SUCH a big thing. You all realize we're getting to summer's halfway point- and what have I done? I went to Boston and have done nothing otherwise. I always say I'll do something useful  this  summer. Glad I didn't lie to myself this year- I only disappoint myself, really.   Please bloody comment, you I-don't-know-what-to-say bastards and just tell me you're reading and I'm not ranting to myself here! Many thanks to KATY, who, unlike all you other swine, commented when I asked her to. :) Nighty night, going to go stare at the ceiling for a bit and think about all my other deep-seated fears and flaws that I never knew I had.   Love and Cookies, everyone.

      I'm Bored, I'm Bored, I'm .... three guesses. Right! I'm Bored! Just spend 2.5 hrs talking a Melissa of Southern California, which was terribly amusing at the time, my regards to her, but now I'm bored. On a brighter note than my self-pitying boredom, Kaitlin's finally home. Finally. Took her bloody long enough (and if you're reading this, love, I blame you entirely!). I'm looking forward to seeing The Notebook tomorrow, tear-jerking romance that it is. Just because I didn't cry in a Walk to Remember and I laughed hysterically in the sad part in Crossroads (Dede and I were bored, we needed a good laugh at bad acting) doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a movie like this. Speaking of which, watched Cold Mountain today. Now there's a depressing movie... gods. Great actors, though. Although Nicole Kidman's southern accent could use a touch of work... I get the feeling that after seeing The Notebook, I'll walk out of the theatre and sigh in self pity at the lack of romance in my own life, and I'll probably reflect on how I just want to be loved... and it will be fairly pitiful. In a contented happy sort of way. I want to draw... and I was very successful the other night. Two anthropomorphic figures in 1 night! I stayed up for ages obsessing, but I'm really proud of them both. I can't say they're humans, cuz...frankly, they're not. An angel w/ a bow and arrow (or is he a GOD?!?! Ooh, you just think about that. Maybe he's Eros or Apollo!) and a Demon w/ the whole goat legs, etc... haven't gotten to his face. I could avoid drawing the angel's face, cuz he's looking sideways, but not the demon (or is he a winged satyr?!?! Ooooh, what now!?)- cuz the demon's looking straight out of the picture. Hmm, maybe I'll have him face sideways, just so I won't have to draw the face. I can get the basic shape, but not faces... those are impossible. I have this perfect image in my mind of what the demon's face looks like, the only problem being converting that to paper. It never quite works w/ anything...sure, it might be a satisfactory result, but I've never ever quite been able to translate the images I produce in my head to paper. Sad, really. Oh well, maybe I'll go try to sleep. A question for you all, one which I expect to be answered via commenting: Why the hell is no one online? It may be 1 now, but what about at midnight, huh? Saturday night, yes... but at midnight?! C'mon, I know you're all awake- I  Know.  Ok, that's about it. You all better start commenting; if nothing else just say "I'm reading." Cuz I feel so unpopular and unloved and... ignored if you don't comment and let me know you're still in my computer in Internet Land. Don't ask, I'm bored.     good test      I AM 71% EVIL GENIUS!

      This is scary cuz I just listened to this song, it's really good.       Which 80s Artist/Song are You? by ass_      Name/Username           Age           Gender           Your 80    Fine Young Cannibals -- Good Thing      Times per Day You Listen to It    7             Created with the ORIGINAL  urlLink  MemeGen  !       So it's been a while, but I figure I post a lot more than most people do, so it's okay. Let's see- life is pretty good. Erm, not a whole lot happening at the moment. My father visited (lives in CA, w/ my 21-year-old stepmother and halfsister), and I  would  rant about that, but... well, the stress has gone back to LA, so I figure what's the need. Besides, I'd have to give you the background stuff... and this is a totally public blog, and... well, you understand. It's a bit personal. Just know that my father is the only person on earth... dead or alive, whom I can truly and honestly say that I Hate w/out blinking an eye. Anyway, my little half sister Maria, who is about 15 months, is awesome, she's lots of fun- though she was sick while here, so not totally happy. Dreading the next time my father visits as he's said Maria and Samanta (stepmother) won't be there, and they stop him lecturing me all the time. Whatever...  The Fourth was lots of fun after 3, when Luis (my father) left. I thought I might be all alone for the fireworks, which would suck... but then it turned out my parents were getting home early. Bert just got home from Vietnam, and I missed him. Also Deirdre (my stepsister) is back from Italy and we chatted for a while. I do wish we were closer in age and spent more time together, cuz we have the same sense of humour and taste in everything. We could've been really good friends if she were the same age as Lauren (other stepsister who is 17). She's really cool and funny, though... so it's always good to bond a bit w/ her. Still haven't seen Lauren, who was w/ a friend for fireworks and was sick all day today. My guess is hangover.   Back to yesterday- after a superb dinner w/ the family I went over to Jordy's house and from there we went to the golf course. Lots of little details that were awesome, but it was a lot of fun. It's always good to see people you sort of recognize in the middle of summer- the funny detail about last night was this guy laying behind us. He said 6 times (I kid you not): I wish the sky always looked like that. Twice: That reminds me of this one time in Australia. First time was kinda like... hmm, ok, weird eavesdropping. Then it got progressively funnier, until we were making fun of him... then we were making funny noises and coordinating our 'oohs' and 'ahhs'. Overall, I had a great time... and I wish everyone had been there. Seriously having Eddie Izzard withdrawl.   Today was pretty fun too... at least for the most part. Ashy has her license and so we drove around Boulder and Louisville all day. After a while, she started putting on kinda... well, crap (lack of a better word) music, and I wasn't in the mood for really loud crap music, but it was fun for the most part. It was hilarious... we were getting lost in Boulder, Ashy kinda freaking out... and we get trapped on this narrow little road in the middle of nowhere behind a little old man in a very small car. Speed limit was 35, he went about 5mph. Then he started to sort of go into the left lane (no on-coming traffic, thank gods)... then he sort of drifted back. It was hilarious in an omg-we're-gonna-get-into-an-accident sort of way. Lol, so... yeah, that's about it. Happy 5th of July!

      I forgot to tell you all, my loves, that last night.... (cue background music)  *sings* I got Circle (EI!) and you did not! I watched Circle stuff for over four hours, and you did not! Life is lovely and fabbity fab fab for me with Eddie... tweedle dee... and other things that rhyme w/ EE.  Fin.   Dunno why so don't ask, but I've started a livejournal.  urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/~stalkerchipmunk/  Cuz you all know I needed another blog... so now, I have 2 blogs, only 1 of which are you allowed to see. 1 xanga. And 1 livejournal. I'd say I'm pretty blog savvy.

      *Huge yawn* Dear gods, only 5 hours of sleep. Normally I'd be fine and ready to do something, but consider this is summer and I've been getting a good 9 hrs a night. Last night my mum caught me up at like 3:00 reading and she told me it was way way too late to be up, go to bed, etc., etc. Being the stubborn child I am, I finished the fic around 4:00 and then went to bed. And of course, being sadistic as parents are prone to do, my mother woke me up at 9:00.  What have I done lately. On my contemplative day (last entry) I did nothing, really. Oh, I think that was the day Dede and I walked down to Subway, met a guy named Danny who was working there and recognized me because my ex used to talk about me all the time in this class they shared *shrug*. Then we walked back up to Dede's house and watched best of Dana Carvey on SNL, very funny stuff. SNL has really gone downhill in the last couple years. I used to watch it for Will Ferrell's opening Bush skits, but... he left, of course. I didn't watch if after that, because the only worthwhile person left was Chris Kattan- I now have word he's left too. Soooo, there you have it. I remember watching the older skits... things with Adam Sandler, David Spade, Chris Farley... gods, Will, and Molly, everybody! But now they're all gone, and the skits have become crap and unoriginal... just boring stupid humor. I mean, I've seen some of the current cast in real acting roles, and they're not that good at all. *Shrug* I miss the good ol' days of SNL, staying up late w/ my sister (who claimed to be able to stay up as long as me, but who ultimately crashed at 11) seeing who was hosting this week, what the opening skit would be... *sigh* Those were the days. Well, that's my SNL rant.  Yesterday... heh, back on topic- yesterday I hung out w/ Patrick, who goes to New Vista. He's a really great guy, makes me laugh a lot... makes me wish he lived closer. But oh well. We saw Fahrenheit (my 2nd time, his first)- he liked it. I must say it's almost as good the second time around- certainly less confusing cuz you've already got the facts in your head, it's just sorting them all out, I suppose. So then we went to his house so he could get food... his parents were at home, so I met them. They seemed very nice... heh, liberal too. Then we went down to Pearl Street, where we walked for 5 minutes and went into Starbucks till I had to go home. Must remind him that he sucks like a baby on a sparkplug- and please don't ask. Heh, he likes dead baby jokes... sick as it sounds, so do I, given the right mood.  These are some of my favorites- I'll spare you the pedophilia or really sick ones. If you're easily offended, then... I dunno, go amuse yourself here:  urlLink www.bored.com .     What's funnier than a dead baby? A dead baby in a clown costume!  How many babies does it take to paint a house? Depends how hard you throw them.  Q: Why did the baby cross the road? A: It was stapled to the chicken.  Q: Why did the Koala fall out of the tree?A: Because it was dead. Q: Why did the baby fall out of the tree?A: Because it was stapled to the koala.  How many babies does it take to make just one bottle of baby oil? Depends on how hard you squeeze them.  What do you call a dead baby with no arms and no legs hanging on your wall? Art.  (Hehehe, I hadn't seen this one before:) How many dead babies can fit in a barrel? 4 1/2.  (Had to do this one pedophile one cuz I thought it was funny... and for good measure) What's the safest way to play with a baby ? With a condom  Ok, I'm done for now. Yes, I'm a sick twisted fuck and if there is a Hell, I'll be hanging out there for a long time... I know that. But face it, you love me anyway. :)  Have a nice day.       *Later* Heh, got bored... went to bored.com, and looked at pickup lines. Liked these two best:   Giant polar bear (What?) It broke the ice.  You're ugly but you intrigue me.

      *Is pensive*  So, right now I'm not sure what to think, basically. My horoscope is behind a day, I discovered. Mentally, right now, I'm just sort of wandering around not knowing what's going on. These moods bother me, but at the same time I'm oddly content. So I don't know what to feel right now, either. Gods, life is weird. And mercurial. And predictably ruled by Murphey, but in an unpredictable sort of way. So I guess my phrase today is meerly- I don't know.  Sort of a scary thought, not knowing. I'm not used to  not knowing , but there it is. Leads me to - what now? I don't know. Go with the flow, take my own advice for other people? Perhaps. Delve into the current contentedness. Ignore the confused problems today. Yes. In other situations, would be bad advice, but today... Hmm, I'm sorry, loves, but I'm going to avoid my computer today and just be alone.
