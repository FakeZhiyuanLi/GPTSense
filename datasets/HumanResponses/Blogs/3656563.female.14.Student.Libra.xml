        In the dictionary a friend is defined as a companion, someone who will help. Well my friends are so much more powerful then that. My friend Natalia is one of the smartest people I have had the pleasure of meeting, Melissa is one of the most creative, Crusty is the most easy going, Beane is one of the funniest, Stock is one of the most un-predictable, and Podd is one of the most brightest, he's always smiling. You guys all make up a big part in my life, and I don't know what I'd do without any of you! Thank you for sticking by me and being yourselves!

          My Dream is to become a dancer on Broadway !   I have been dancing since I was two and I have always loved it!   I just had my end of the year recital last night and I did a tap solo, and I loved every moment of it!   Dancing is something I do to forget about everything else and just let go and have fun, I love it.

       At first there were 5 best friends who would stick together through thick and thin; Jaque, Beane, Stock, Podd, and Cede. Jaque, that's me! These five tackled the most dangerous struggle of all together, HIGH SCHOOL! At times there was drama, heart-ache, and even battles, but after it all they always came out on top, together as one! Nothing would get in the way of this friendship!

        Once upon a time, ther were three friends: Nina, Noah, and Elana. They were good students, A's an B's on report cards, always on time on to school, and always honest!! Well, one day at school, the work started to pill up, and they all know how to do it al, it would just take along time. So   Noah came up with this great idea, what if we help eachother out so we can have time to e-mail our mohters and tell them what great people they are!! Nina and Elana were scared at first, but they all agreed to do the wrk at the best of their abilty and HELP eachother out. Well, one day there teacher Mr. Moody saw these three intelligente kids   helping eachother, he took them one at a time into a secluded room, and told them that ther actions to help eachother was wrong and unfair!!! Each one of them honestly explained to the nice principal that their actions were on the right place, that they were helping eachother out so they had time to write nice e-mails   to their mothers thanking them for everythig that they do. Well the prinicpal understood and sent them back to class. The kids were awarded with an award of honesty at the end of the day by the ukiah unified school district. When they all got home they explained to their parents that tere actions were awarded and honored. This story is a tale of three friends that just wanted to help eachother and have time to thank their mothers, and in the end, they came out on top.

         I know I need to talk about something else, so I think I will talk about new and old.      Meeting new  people is never bad, unless you forget your old ones. And getting new clothes is    cool, as long as you don't lose your old style. And getting new shoes is good, KENNY!,     as long as you don't forget your old ones that were with you through think   and thin.      What I'm    trying to get across is that in life, it is always good to move on to bigger and better     things, as long as you don't forget the old people and things that got you there.

        Well, it's almost midnight, and I'm trying to stay awake till 12:30 so i can see when of the best shows in the whole world, BUG JUICE!!!! Because Nathan Daniel Grebil made me miss it at 11 and my mom made me miss it at 8, so 12::30 is the next   episode! Well, on saturday I am going down to santa barbara on a plane, by myself!!! and since I'm 14, I'm not considered a minor anymore, so I have to get my ticket, get my bags on the plane, and get on the right flight, ALL BY MYSELF!!! I could end up   in Iceland!! uhhh, I'm getting nervous just thinking about it, but I'm excited to go see my aunt and uncle and go shoppping, going to the beach, and seeing my cousins and driving down to cal poly! But, still, in order to get there, I have to pass the ride of   my life, an airplane ride by myself! I'm not scared of airplanes, it's just the fact that I'm going by myself, I mean ,I'm from ukiah, I'm sheltered! Well, if anyone out there has any advice, I would really like to hear it. Have a great week, and I hope to see you when i get back, if I make it there and back in one piece!
