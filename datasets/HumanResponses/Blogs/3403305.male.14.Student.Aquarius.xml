      Yesterday felt like a dream. Bobbie and I went to the movies. I really do love her. Anyway, for today, my parents made me get up, so right now it's 8:04 AM. That sucks. I hope Bobbie and I are able to go to the movies again sometime. Maybe I can go to her house, she could come here, the world never knows what will happen. Only clue as to what Bobbie and I did yesterday at the movies is, she is a really good kisser :P.  "It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life."

      Bobbie,  	I know we only just met, but I feel like I have known you for ever. When we were together Saturday, I was calm, I wasn't my general self. I like what you're helping me become. To quote from a Slipknot song "I never wanted anybody more, than I wanted you." It explains how I feel about you. I want to spend every waking moment I have with you. You helped me be calm and peaceful Saturday. I want to be like that more. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I can't stop thinking about you. It's like I'm stuck in a dream or a fantasy..................But if it is a dream, I never want to wake up from it. I treasure every moment I spend or talk to you as if it would be my last. I love and hate this feeling of not knowing when I'm going to be able to see you again. I want to see you again.

      Loky here, haven't made a post in a long time. Anyway, I'm here to anounce that I am starting a band, called Hymns of Hate. I will be vocals/guitar. My friend, Eric, is going to be the drummer. I'm still looking for a bass player, so if you can play, or know someone who can play, e-mail: hohsignup@yahoo.com.

      About 10 minutes ago I tripped over my coffee table. My leg hurts like hell now. Not to metion the fact that I've been pretty much emotionally drained for some reason. I don't know if my parents read this, but if they do, I don't care. For about 4 days straight I was having suicidal thoughts. It took my two best friends awhile to calm me down. I wish I would have known Bobbie cared about me that much, if I would have, I wouldn't have had those thoughts, I think. I made a promise to her that I won't hurt myself as long as she's there for me. So yeah, I wish I would have cleared something up before I made that promise, sometimes hurting myself a little helps me pass time. No, I don't carve into my arm, just a little hit with a chain over my arm or something. Well, now that I'm thinking about it again, it's bringing back pain. I'm gonna go for a bit.

      Bobbie came over to my house yesterday. My dad wouldn't trust us in my room alone together, damn bastard.....I asked him if we could go for a walk, he said sure. So Bobbie and I went for like an hour long walk. That was a lot of fun. Bobbie, if/when you read this, I love you and want to be with you forever. I never thought I could feel this way about someone. I'm going to say what all Bobbie and I talked about and did, but we had some long talks, and yes, we did kiss. All the information I'm going to give out. Alright, I'm gonna go for a bit, I'll post again when I have some free time.  I love you Bobbie.  ~~~~~~My life has been turned into a dream~~~~~~

      I haven't made a post in a long time, sorry bout that. Anyway, to my actual post. The past three days have fucking sucked. I've been puking for some reason, I never get sick this time of the year. Worst part about that, is yesterday, I started to puke up blood. At least I think it was blood, I mean, I don't drink any redish fluids. Today my dad forced me to go to a cook-out somewhere I've never been. I love my dad, but sometimes he pisses me off so badly.............He kept calling me gay in front of my family because I'm always wearing these two bracelets Bobbie gave me. Hopefully Bobbie can come over on Monday, I miss her so much. I started pushing my hair out of my face, now it looks somewhat good. Did I say I miss Bobbie yet, I did, well I'll say it again. I miss Bobbie a lot.  That's most of the pain I'm going through right now. I'm going into detail on the rest, I'm just going to say if you knew it, you'd probably need a theripist. If Bobbie calls me tomorrow, she said she would, I have trust in her. I'm going to read this to her over the phone, damn, in order to print it out, I need to put more paper in the printer, but I'm too lazy to get up. I always get off the computer when I'm on the phone, I don't know why. My dad is rushing me off the computer. So bleh, it was a long post. I'll try to do it again sometime...:P   ~_~I am the one who waits, I am the one who is here, I am the one that will always be~_~

      So much has happened since I last posted, I don't feel like typing but oh well. Bobbie and I split up. Yes, I know I fucked up somewhere, actually, I know exactly where I fucked up at. It comes down to a fucking phone call, one god damned call. Who knew one call could ruin so much? I know I didn't. The person who called me knows who they are, and I will say it as simply as this, fuck you and get the hell out of my life. I know it seems rude, but, still get the fuck out of my life. I will say this to a certain person, not the one that called me. It seems that you can do as you want to, so I'm going to start doing as I want. Pain, pain, pain. Pain is a fucked up feeling for me. I am in a lot of pain, but hell, I don't care anymore, I've gotten used to it. Now I'm having a fit of laughter because it was so obvious. It would be so easy to blame others for my problems right now, but I think apart of getting older is realizing your mistakes, and I am standing up and taking the blame fully for how I feel. Bobbie and I could get back together, but I doubt that is going to happen. This was meant to be a serious post, but I can't find the words I want to use, so fuck it, now I'm just going to joke around.    Myk, you type way to much man. Geez, if I could type that much I'd have books out. Zaph, well, Zaph and I have difenately lost connection somewhere.  Damn, back to the seriousness of things, I think I might have to go see my old therapist if I keep these feelings up. God damn, I keep typing for no reason, so I'm going to end this post, more than likely you will have a very longer post tomorrow.

      Geni Sauce By Zaphlon ( zac roberts)  Part One.... Genesis This is a story A completely true story None of it’s made up Except for the parts that are Verse 1 Long ago when Evil cattle lived in Atlantis They ate lots of broccoli and hunted wooly mammoth  But the Evil Cattle king had no Evil cattle Queen He went to America  and set off the country’s balance It sunk into the ocean and ryhmin to balance is not what I do Verse 2 The cattle king went to Indian land, and there he went to the chief At first, it was cool, but he wanted to turn the evil cattle king into beef So the Indians summoned a monster But when the monster spoke He told a joke And nobody laughed The lil monster got mad So he went home and told his dad His dad came back and killed them all That’s how baby’s are made in the monster’s ball END,yo

      Culture Lesson by Myk Doolin  (Spoken) I had to shoot it to make sure it was dead  (Verse 1) Cut through the neck and became an apparition, Lightsaber vs. taser would make one big collision Gained more power and knowledge through being alchemistic The Faust that has become me, no soul, just optimistic Don’t ask how, just know why, it’s confusing, but still try, understand the ways of defeating the albatross simple and low loss, state of mind, you’re your own boss hack life, make it work at your own cost fault phantoms spread like viruses throughout the human race tracing and erasing the truth, and the real face, one big lie, waiting to be envisioned through our eyes when we die but yet, everyone seems to still have pride, why? You may ask this, but really it’s common sense, they’re all blocked by a misleading monolith  (Chorus: Faith No More’s Epic) You want it all, but you can’t have it It’s in your face but you can’t grab it     (Verse 2) some people perceive me as a herbal twister maybe it’s the way I think creativity is my girl and I can’t resist her immortality came back when I lost my top and died listen up you primitive screw heads, are you outta your mind do you even know your kind find yourself, makes life divine  out of time, wait a second, I’m in a time machine,  I got all the time I need, wanna go back, and make time for me? Haven’t ya seen, the buzz you can get from caffeine Methamphetamines make minds obscene like a latrine The unknown third bean in the salad, watch out Stab you in the back with a phoenix talon Didn’t expect it, you shoulda wrote it down in blood with a pin Visional arithmetic, how every human wants their kin  (Chorus: Faith No More’s Epic x 2) You want it all, but you can’t have it It’s in your face, but you can’t grab it  (Spoken) You might not know what this is…………But, you know you want it……..and you know you can’t have it, but you’re willing to do almost anything to get it…………Sometimes, you gotta work around what doesn’t come…………but, always remember, it’ll get there soon enough.   Traffic  I’m gonna walk out into traffic With no red lights I’m gonna walk out into traffic With no yields or stop signs A walk out into traffic My life

If i trip I will never rise just lay there and close my eyes And slowly fade to black never coming back I see no need to be a prisoner of reality a prisoner of what people say I want to live on my terms and allow others to do so too i wanna be happy thats what i wanna do I want to mean and i want to live i dont want to just merely exist in a sea of people, they pass by millions dying, millions cry That i dont know and never will reality is a jagged pill bittersweet forever wish things were better wish people knew like they could see im not insane im just me your all insane im just me  I dream of reality Of simpler things and Fantasies Of every thing that cannot be and everything i believe should be I dream of reality Of simpler things and fantasies I dream of Love Life I dream of thee I dream of reality  I need to find someone to hold so i can be told "I love you" and "I love you too" that is what i need to do a lover a friend a companion someone who's love will never end I may be young and foolish it all may be untrue its the only way to live its the only way  I dream of reality Of simpler things and Fantasies Of every thing that cannot be and everything i believe should be I dream of reality Of simpler things and fantasies I dream of Love Life I dream of thee I dream of reality

      Hehe, it's Loky, I'm going to post a song that I wrote. If I find out it was stolen, I'll hunt you down and kill you. Have a nice day.   I've got scars you can't see A past of misery Then along came you You changed everything about me Now you're out of my life again How can I still be like you wanted me to be?  It comes down to this You wanted this you wanted that I gave, I gave, I gave, I gave I never asked for a single thing Now is my time, I want You to know, how bad I am doing, without you All I wanted, was you Now you abandoned me I'm alone once again  I've got scars you can't see A past of misery Then along came you You changed everything about me Now you're out of my life again How can I still be like you wanted me to be?  I want to be numb again But this pain will not go away You've screwed me over To many times before I refuse to fall this time You can not win anymore Because I have grown immune To your words, to your pain I've grown immune..... TO YOU  I've got scars you can't see A past of misery Then along came you You changed everything about me Now you're out of my life again How can I still be like you wanted me to be?
