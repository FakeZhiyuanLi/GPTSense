         Today i will be telling you about things i have learned in web mastering class with my gayest teacher ever.. mister rea!! Well... people dont stop to think about what you've learned or what difference a teacher can make in your life. Mister Rea has made a big difference in my life. He can be mean, gay, funny, dumb,serious at times, a good teacher and something you dont find in every teacher... a gay friend. Nah i need to be serious, in mister rea i found alot of trust, confidence and most of all faith.He is a cool teacher because he gets at our levels sometimes, its like he still has that kid within him which i think is cool. The other day, we were taking turns using the scooter. Hes a really cool teacher and person to be around with.  He has taught me so many differnet interesting things which i thought made this class fun.  He taught me to get in touch with the person within me. He showed me to get in touch with my feelings and to be able to express them ( just on the computer though).I learned how to use a computer the nice way, to have patience, new ways to explore the internet and most of all to ask for help. I was the type of person with alot of pride that wouldnt want any ones help or nothing like that but in this class its different, The only way you can learn is by asking for help and its ok to do so.  I think i can take this class over and over and over again just because mister rea made it fun, i always eager to come to his class, i actually enjoy working in this class. The things that i learned in this class im pretty sure would be useful for the future when they find out i can make my own wep page and have my own website thats really cool, so mister rea thank you for teaching me the interesting things i learned in this class i never thought i would need but im pretty sure i do.. mister rea you rock!!

          Hey since i have nothing to talk about or write about i am going to write about a little person who means alot to me. Her name is Maribel and she is one of the most important people in my life. I have gotten to know her so well this whole semester. At first, i was like "man i can't stand her" or "she's annoying" but what i didnt know is that i was misjudging a person i didnt even know and just took other people's word against hers. People would tell me stuff about her and man i use to think the worse of her till i sat down with her one day to talk in luch which was right there behind that painting in that picture.   We just sat down and talked about our problems and what i realized is that she needed somebody to talk to just like me. She has gotten so close to me she became like my little sister and i have gotten so much affection for her just because she was there for me and for the great person she was and still is. Last week, she made one of the everyday mistakes a teenager makes in life but this time, it really came with hard consequences. She wont be coming back to school (which sux). I tried my best to be a good friend to her and to be there and to try to make her change her mind of different things and in a way i feel bad because i feel like i didnt push her hard enough to make her realize what she was doing was stupid. I feel like if i left her down. She has nobody in this world, just her dad, her brother and sisters.     Things arent going to change jus cuz shes not in the same school as me, i am still going to keep in touch with her cuz i know she needs me now more than anything and i will still go visit her just because i love her and because she was there whenever i didnt have no one and i just want to thank her for that. I wouldnt change any thing about her just that she wouldnt have done what she did which made her be gone now. I feel like i lost a part of me that i use to bring with me to school , she use to make me lighten up and to smile and to enjoy every moment of my life and that is what im going to continue to do just for her... i love you girl and remember im here for you whenever u need me.

          One of the coolest person i know thats in my family i would have to say my  MOMMY  i can talk to her about anything and tell her everything which makes her cool because shes a really understandable person  but sometimes she can be really uumm.. how can i say it?? i can jus loose my patient with her really quick but i still love her.    No one can ever take her place because whats special about her is that not only is she my mommy but also my best friend. I can talk to her about anything and though it might take her forever to understand me in the end she always ends up understanding me.Sometimes i dont take the time to even tell her a thank you or how much i really am grateful for al that she does for me. I cant see myself alone without her nor without my daddy.Yeah i love my daddy too hes a good dad too though sometimes he can be really jealous but i know he wuvs me. But the connection that i have with my mami is different from the one i have with my dad.   My mom has been there since the day i walked into this world actually i jus fell out but u know what i mean.She has all the qualitys for a mother: loving, caring, trustworthed, understandable, and all the other good things. She has done so much for me and i just want to thank her for being the greates mommi anyone could ever have...   There are several times that i have ran to my dad for my problems or if i did something bad sometimes it was better to tell my dad because my mommy exagerates alot sometimes, ok well most of the time but i still love him cuz hes lovable jus like a teddy bear.      ~p.s I LOVE YOU MOMMY!!!~        ~p.s.s I LOVE YOU TOO DADDY!!!~

          There's many things that the future holds in its hands. I dont know what my life will be dedicated for or if i get married who will i marry or if i have kids how many will i have? Those are questions that im dying to look for.. i want to know what my life is gonna be about. I dont like to predict the future but whatever future i get i will try to make good decisons and think as a mature and bigger person.   Time is something that i really dont have patient for, i am unpatient i want to see what god has planned out for me. I want to know how imma live my life, but i have to be patient theoretically. I feel a great confusion inside o fme because sometimes i just want to rush into my life but at the same time i am afraid of what my future is gonna be but what i know so far is that i want to be either a teacher or an assitant nurse. I want to go graduate and go to college to make my parents proud of me then finish college and then start my career.   My aspiration is to be able to work with kids because i love working with kids. I love the way they show they love you and i love playing with them which is why i want to be an elementary teacher or maybe a pediatrician. I believe kids are the only innocent ones in this world and cant be blame  for the things and the war that go around the world. I just wnat to be able to reach my goals and achieve what i want which is go to college and get a good career for me and my future family.

             I am a person who makes alot of mistakes and doesnt realize how bad they are after their done which is too late cuz the damage has already been done. one of the most important ones that i regret is well actually i cant think of any right now..  so im not going to talk about that.. change subject..i dont think i regret anything because the good thing about that is that i learned from my mistakes which is the good thing about it.   Nah to be honest with you i just regret letting go so many things i had in my hand for example i wouldnt call it letting go because that person is still there for me and were still together but things arent just the same. I would do dumb things like write letters to my guy friends, walk with other GUY friends just to make him jealous and just because of that it leaded to a point where he doesnt trust me any more and i dont like that feeling because i wonder if sometimes he has doubts about me.   I dont like him thinkin that i talk to someone else or that i like his friend just because of those sill things because that makes me feel so bad and i dont like feeling like that and it was all because i dont know just for the he!! of it.I regret tryin to see his actions just by tryin to make him jealous because it leaded to where he doesnt trust me or not even my feelings anymore and if i could i would go back and not do those things that i did and change what i did just to make him realize how much i do care for him but its just one of those that u have live up to because its in the past and u cant change the past, the only left to do is by not doing the same things in the future.   Try to make things better and make them change because things change but in this case they have changed for the bad because we have lost alot of communication and alot of trust which are one of the most important things in a relationship and wish so bad i can get them back but i am working on it, working on showing him that i made a mistake and i learned for the good and that i really do care for him and do want to make things work out!!!

I'm going to be a junior next year and that is very hard to believe cuz if i remember not too long ago i was in the 3rd grade and jus the other day i was a seventh grader and a couple of days ago i was barely a freshman and now imma be a junior man time does slip by really fast. But imma keep myself concentrated this year in school i cant be fooling around cuz even though i want to stay in high school as long as i can i want to be ready for college.    uummm.... i got these new pink panties and their really cool... oh yeah my cat is on a diet because the doctor said she was too fat. can u believe that?? im crampin really bad right now and i have to go to the restroom but im too lazy to get up. yesterday was fathers day and i gave my daddy alot of kisses and hugs. well since i have nothin to say anymore i guess ill close this up but i will try to fill you in more later.... byeee  p.s this is my friend Bryan who got hit by mr.salcedo's car!!!    *Before*   *After*
