      the time we spend together its the happiest i've ever had but as with all things good something has to happen to make it all go bad  oppression and dictation will try to stop me seeing you but if every army in the land and every father with his own commands came together to stop us i'd blast them away without delay and run off with you into the blue of the sunlight fading away  rules were made to be broken

      thoughts busy like flies buzzing round shit  this is not a happy day  this is not a happy day  i'm in the corner crying; in the dark demising  i have never felt this way  i have never felt this way  her mouth stiched up like a rag-doll's sore  i can feel myself decay  i can feel myself rot away   rocking in the corner of my mind's prison cell  proped up and leaning against my dark wall  i can't stop thinking these paranoid thoughts  and i wish sometimes that the roof would fall   to be smashed on the head  or beaten without end  would give me a break  from this angst-ridden life  and let my soul descend   problem after problem  i'm starting to ask; what's the point?  why bother trying if you just end up losing?  in everything i do, i only disapoint   i'm sitting here now  waiting for word from you  but what use is a one way word  to a mute beauty,  to whom happiness is long overdue

      when she is sad i am sad when she is down i am down when she is upset i cry when she is angry i lash out  i am forever connected. when she is happy, i am happy. i like to see smiles on that angelic face, like when she looks up at me asking me to stay, and when i know i should go i stay anyway.  but then she goes deep down into the depression. and she wont speak and she wont smile and i am concerned; it must be my fault.  stupid friends dont help. when i'm trying to console her, they rant and they rave, but i just want to be alone. with her.  an unretured message. an ignored display of affection. a sad, lonely look upon that face of complete perfection is like dirt, smeared, over a masterpiece.

      my god - it's getting worse. it's like i'm under a spell, or a curse. everytime i see her, my heart explodes in my chest. that's been happening for weeks; and my mind's a wasp's nest. but now she talks to me, and she sits with me and we laugh and we cuddle and we smile and we snuggle and everything is perfect;  everything's in its right place i could ask for no more just her; in her dress made of lace.  and her hair - soft as the slowly fallen snow and her eyes - out of the darkness, they glow and her skin - smooth from her head to her toe and her beauty - something only i know.  i love her, and now she knows. i think she loves me, she is this year's rose

      A Small Note:  This is my first post of prose, and I just stayed up too late one night after watching a Movie, scared of the next day, and felt a little inspired. It's like all that high-insight crap you get from smoking too many drugs - but i don't do that. I just get the crap come to me, without the funny hallucinations. Without the fun! :) here it goes:   	I envy Smokers. 	They have it easy, I think. It’s not that I like it. I hate the smell, and the taste, and the way the toxic fumes stick to your clothes and your skin like a fly does to flypaper. Also, I don’t think it looks ‘cool’ or anything. The whole notion of something so silly being such a symbol of status in the world is not only absurd, but also frightening. Frightening because it scares me to think that people can be so stupid. 	No, I envy them for one reason. Their absence. Whenever they feel the urge they can leave the room to go outside for a quiet, solitary smoke. They don’t need a reason to leave, they just say, “hey, I’m going for a fag” and there are no questions. You try saying “hey, I fancy a small walk, a bit of fresh air maybe, to clean out the old lungs. Maybe clear my head” and you’ll be looked at strangely, maybe heads tilted at an angle, and thought of as some kind of loon. 	You’ve seen it in the Movies. A Man with a long coat on and a shaggy head of hair that has a mind of it’s own, leaning up against the stone wall, taking a drag and then blowing it out into the air, so it can dance with the snowflakes for a moment, before it passes and diffuses. He’s escaped the party, and the endless mingling, and the mindless chitter-chatter of the moronic masses who have attended some social gathering. And once again, the old cliché shines through, of the Smoker, who yet again has no reason to escape, but can. 	I wish I could say, “Hey, I’m going outside for a smoke” and be left alone for two seconds. If it’s really busy, or everyone’s chattering away, trying to be heard but never getting anywhere, finishing up so they don’t care, they just love to hear themselves speak, then I want to get out. To be able to get out, out into the cold, into the snow, into the winter that we never get here. They only have that in the Movies. The dark backdrop, with the tree’s topped in creamy white snow, and the snow on the ground, like a fallen cloud, just waiting to be stepped in, but you don’t want to because you know you’ve never seen anything so perfect in all your life as the fresh fallen snow. And the tiny speckles of white that fall from the sky, out of focus in the lens so they don’t interrupt the frame, but noticeable nonetheless. And then they dance in the sky, floating sideways, falling a little more, or maybe shooting up in a gust of wind, only to meet the smoke from the Smoker’s contraption, and to play a little more in the air. The Smoker, leaning there on the wall, knowing he has to go back inside, and continue to glad-hand the hoards of mongrel Salesmen, but he enjoys his moments alone, and treasures each and every second, as if it were his last. 	Too bad it kills you.

      everything was down; dirty, desparate and undignified. there was no end to the night; no salvation in sight  but then you came and you gave me news: unexpected. and the corners of my mouth they looked at the sun,  and shunned the ground  i didnt raise the roof, i didnt smash up my room, i didnt tell every one i saw but inside, i changed. the lightbulb that went out all those months ago found some extra juice and kept on burning  bright as the clearest sun; i think something wonderful has just begun.

      i want you bad; you look so good i can't belive you; you're so obnoxious! your face is a work of art - it defies the laws of nature you can be so immature sometimes it makes me want to leave your so funny; and different; and unique you don't listen to my opinion; it's as if i'm not here your tastes are refined you have such a closed-mind your soul flies without hesitation or struggle you treat me as if i'm below you; as if i'm a muggle you don't love me you don't love me and you never will and you never will still, it's what you love, not what loves you, that really counts or is that just bollocks, made up by some loser. A friend of yours?

      i have trouble forming relationships with people i am a constant fuck-up it is impossible to form a loving two-way relationship with me i am the eternally wanting i am the forever wishing i have a life-long crush  in the forest of society it is dark and i am cold i'm looking at life from outside the window  nose pressed with heavy breathing making fog against the pane against the pain i block it all out and forget about it all but it keeps coming back bubbling under the surface  empty packets of old and forgotten crisps are around me stains on the carpet spills from yesterday food hanging about the place the stench is devouring the smell must be mutating my room is constant bleakness and i'm just too lazy to clean it up  my annoying self-loathing has alienated me from my peers which just increases my selfishness all i can do is complain and winge and moan and groan which in turn throws me into even more depression its a never-ending fucking cycle i'll never be wanted, always left wanting  what a stupid bastard i have been.

      trying to get to sleep but bothered by people who calls themselves friends i roll over - all night they've been annoying me one fires a spitball at me - the other points and laughs i ignore it i let it go i say to myself: once more and i'm leaving and it happens once more  i'm in the other room and its silent and peaceful but they come back - and fire at me some more i let it slide i let it pass i wait for them to go, but i'm waiting a long time  they won't go, and the demeaning act goes on the embarressing truth come clear no friends no respect no point  i leave again, and go to a third room but thats no good, 'cause it's infested infested with a bloody great spider and i dont like spiders not-one-bit  its another panic attack fast-breathing fast-breathing can't stop breathing, fasterandfaster oh look! the water buffalo's crying! the big moosey is weeping! the hot turns to cold and the cold turns to hot and my head is burning up - you could fry an egg and half an hour later; it passes  and i realise - the illusion of friends is dangerous you let your defences down and trying to explain yourself is pointless just sit and wear your frown you little baby.

      The light arrives at my window, its five twenty-two, AM. The smell of the alcohol rises up from the floor, spilt at some ungodly hour.  I'm in a room, half-covered bodies on the floor. Both boys and girls asleep. They huff, they wince; They snore.  I turn around and see all these people, and I feel tired and sick and cold. But then I see you, lying next to me: Silent. Sombre, Quiet and Calm. You're the most beautiful thing, ever to be seen, with your face half-covered by your arm.  Your face and your skin, they all seem so different. Like nothing you can see on a screen. And somehow you shine, like your soul is alive, grown wings and flown into me.  Words cannot describe you; And yes, that's an old cliché. But in the morning, you'll be gone. And no longer by my side you can stay.  I love the way you look, the way you sound, the way you smell. And even if all i can have is one glimpse of you, i'd sell my soul to hell.

      i'm cold.  half of me has gone. the negative has disappeared. it's been taken, i've been taken, and all the bad stuff has left.  did someone take it? did it leave? i put everything i had into this and it blew up in my face like a mortar in the ground.  the thing is, now all the bad stuff has gone, and the negative is no longer here, what is left?  nothing.  and that's the worst thing.  i'm still cold.

      That night we talked for hours on end. we planned a date; just us two friends.  but at school the next day, you tossed me away like a dirty old oxfam top. what could i do? what could i say? when you ignore me the way you do.  i get home confused, alone, unamused. over-thinking, neurotic and pale. i feel sick, i feel dumb. i feel sad, i feel numb. i feel silly, embaressed. i feel rejected, despondent.  maybe pain is the answer?

      i join you at your table. we sit here and sulk. we sit here and bawl. glared at, sneered at, we feel like quarries. endlessly filling, endlessly filling with rock and stone and heartache and sorrow.  a bang! a flash! a thrown paper cup. your dress ruined; covered in drink, stained with jealousy, covered in anger, drenched in sorrow.  one single, woeful tear trickles down from your eye. with it, it takes your make-up, as it falls from your cheek, down your beautiful, perfect skin, into the lap of your spoiled gown.  the anger infuses me and the rage devours me and  i cannot keep it inside me any longer.  ~  i left that place empty. and as we walked home, across the dew-dropped grass, glistening with the moon's refection, i looked back. and stared. at the blood-stained curtains that i had left. and the crimson glow inside, from the moonlight through the drapes, that are now their final shroud.

      And there you go, you leave me here alone. i sit and i stare, wishing you were there, sat beside me, sat with me, but not even an icey stare, is thrown for me. me like a dog, waiting by an empty bowl.  you laugh and you talk, with all the other boys. but me, i get nothing. i am nothing. here, on my own. alone.  with a sorrowful ear, i hear, you laughing away, having a great last day, as i sit, and i stare. and you're unaware, of my despair. laughing away, as you do.

      Oh look, it's him  The shadow in the hallway  Floating softly past the lockers and weaving slowly through the crowds  Going against the traffic flow  With a transparent look and nowhere to go    What an ugly looking thing  I heard he self-harms  Always caked in black  Never smiling or talking  Has he got any friends?  Who cares? I'm sure he's fine.    He won't shut up about me  It's all he talks about  Like some kind of stalker  Always asking for time      My time  It's so boring with him  What a freak    I don't understand any of it  I makes me so sad somtimes  All they talk about is useless rubbish  All they worry about is pointless garble  I need someone to keep me sane some of the times  Like a kindred spirit or something  But she doesn't need me  None of them need me  And it makes me feel so pointless  Knowing that I have no purpose  Knowing that I have no talent  Knowing that I'll never find anyone  Hoping someone will find me  I dress in black because you'd all rather I were a shadow  You'd rather I wasnt real  The tarnished spot of dirt on you're otherwise clean cloth    This is so pointless

      i want to cry  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the tears just won't come out  i want to die  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free myself from all this doubt  i want to feel  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something new and something different  i want to be  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; someone else and less malignant  &nbsp;  i'd sell my soul  [or my body or my blood]  to spend eternity with you  and get myself through all this mud.  i only feel right  when i'm by your side  but it hurts when you're gone  when will this pain subside?  &nbsp;  i feel sick - i feel sad  i'm so stupid - i feel mad  my mouth is watering  salivating - overflowing  like before you throw up  spill your guts - chuck it up  my stomach hurts so very much  i want to vomit - i want to die  i want to feel something other than this  i need to escape - i need to fly  &nbsp;  where have you gone?  you've left me here alone  i miss you so much  now that i'm on my own  &nbsp;  one night i will cry  and then the pain might die  i need you by my side  happiness - i am denied.  next to you i will stand  and i will kiss you: so grand  but will our love withstand  my paranoid mind/or my worrying thoughts  i am distraught.

       We talked for a while   We hugged and cuddled a lot   You pecked my cheek when you left   I pecked your's back   But I spent the whole time   In the back row of that dark room   Looking at you   Wanting to kiss you   Wanting to show you that I love you   But I'm used to rejection   And it's scarred me.     So now you're gone And I feel so empty Like a part of me has died Only to be resurrected When you return   I try to keep myself busy But you're on my brain I call you - but no answer How long till I see you again?   I keep thinking: If anything could happen now What would I want to happen? And the answer is the same everytime I wish for a knock And for my door to open And for you to be standing there Glowing with your usual aura of beauty I long for your touch The sweet sound of your voice And the moments we spend together Curled up together Am I asking for too much?

      I'm stuck in a painting I'm stuck with a beautiful view I'm stuck in a masterpiece I'm stuck here; without you  Dangling off of this cliff I get a sinking feeling I'm here alone Only a photo of you And the rocks below start to look appealing  And at the parties late at night I'm there in the corner thinking of you wanting you needing you  I need someone to cling to I'm an emotion junkie When I say that I love you You must know that it's true I can give you that guarantee  Wishing for a girl like you Hoping for a girl like you Hungry for a girl like you No Not 'like' you,  You.
