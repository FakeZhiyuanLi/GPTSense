          My inner child is six years old!    Look what I can do!  I can walk, I can run, I can read! I like to do stuff, and there's a whole big world out there to do it in.  Just so long as I can take my blankie and my Mommy and my three best friends with me, of course.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

You are a total girly girly at heart - and prefer your coffee with good conversation.

      People are always asking me where I live. I live in the country even though I tell most people that I'm from Quinlan. I went to high school in Quinlan. My Dad likes to tell people that we are from Union Valley. Union Valley is small community just big enough to get a sign on the road, but not big enough to have the population put on it. The only thing other than houses in Union Valley is a gas station, a fire department, and a couple of grease spoon eating joints. Not to much here. My parents house sits on 16 acres of beautiful landscape.   urlLink    Picture of My house       urlLink

      This is such a great thing. You can upload pictures then when someone ask to see a picture you have it ready to show them. You don't have to wait for them to upload them to the internet. They're already there you just have to give them a link to your pictures and the look to their hearts delight.  urlLink My Albums

      I can't believe it is almost ten years since I graduated from high school. This planning stuff is kinda nerve racking. I can't believe there is so much do when planning an event like this. Trying to accommodate everyone is hard work. We have found that a Reunion Planning book has been our savior. We would rather keep the money that a Reunion Planner would take from us and use it for more decorations or lower the price of the tickets. We feel they are a rip off for small schools like us, Quinlan.

      Who still has tape players these days? I haven't had a tape player that worked in years. All of the cars I've ever owned have always had CD players in them.

      School can be a great thing but it can be a nightmare. I would never recommend to anyone doing what I have done this summer is take Anatomy and Physiology during the summer. It has been a nightmare literally. You just have to look at the end result. Education will take you far in life. There is nothing like having an education. The world looks very highly on people with educations. Though school may not be for everyone, but you don't have to college to receive an education.

      Oh how blind dates can be nerve racking. You don't know much about the person. You don't know what the person may look like, even if you have a picture. You don't know if they look anything like the picture they sent you. If you've been chatting on the phone or internet these days is that person just as charming in person as they seem to be in person. You just hope and pray that they are everything you hope they would be. Hope that they live up to all the expectations you have put on them.

      We have finally found a place for our reunion. It's going to be the same place we had our Senior Prom, the Wyhdam Garden Hotal at Dallas Park. I am so excited that things are starting to fall into place. We have set the ticket prices until Dec 1 the price is single $50 and couple $90. After Dec 1 single $60 and couple $100. Finally at the door the price is single $70 and couple $110. This way we can make sure we have enough money for everything. We don't think we'll have much if any money left over. I am so supprised how much things cost these days. The banquet hall, the dj, the food prices are going up  and up. Becuase of the prices of the tickets we probably won't have much decorations becuase of the price of everything else.

      Tuesday I went to a special screening of the show. Though it had no real plot line and was pretty stupid I thought it was hilarious. I laughed the whole time.

      I can't believe the first semester of summer is over. It was fast and furious. I was taking anatomy and physiology (a&p) and nutrition this first semester. I think I going to make a B in both classes it all depends on that wonderful final we have to take. Both classes this semester are having a commutative final. I hate commutative test. I understand things like a foreign language or math where things build on itself.

      I think I just going to give up on boys. I just seem to be picking jerks lately. I was suppose to have met a guy last night, but he stood me up. So to night after going out with my best friend we went to meet this guy again to give him a second chance. After waiting for an hour and half we and he didn't show up we left. On the way home I finally got a hold of him and he didn't understand why I would be upset. How long should you wait for someone to show up. We waited that long because we were playing pool and I wasn’t watching the time closely. Supposedly he was eating dinner all this time. How long does it take to eat? I have never taken more than an hour to eat. If it’s taking you that long your eating way to much food. I will never drive to meet a guy again. The only way I’ll drive for a guy is if we are dating. Boyfriends are one things, but you should never treat someone you don’t even know like this.

      I went last night to see the third movie in the Harry Potter series. It was good, but there was so much left out. I think if you don't book before hand you're not going to get some of the movie. You may not realize that you're not getting it, but there a lot of parts left out. There parts or lines I kept expecting to hear and they didn't happen. I understand that the books are getting longer and they are trying not to make the movies longer, but I definitly recomend reading the books before you see the movies. I don't know if I like the new Dumbledure. I know we can't have Richard Harris back, but Micheal Gambon is not Dumbledure. I hope that the next one will be better. I'm ready for the next book to come out. There are just two more books to come out.

      I'm in the process of finding an apartment and the apartment isn't calling back. I found a perfect apartment about a month ago and I haven't heard anything from them. This apartment is righ across from campus I wouldn't have to buy a parking permit and the shuttle stop is just a block from the apartment. They have 3 different size of one bedroom appartments that I get to pick from. I going to day to find out if they gave my appartment away and I have to look for another place. I hope they haven't and I still able to get an appartment in this complex. I would like to move in before school starts so that I can find a job before I start classes. I think looking for a job while I'm in class might be hard. I just can't to move and have my own place.

      No rest for the weary second semester has already started. Just as I finish with one class the next class starts the next day. I guess that's what I get for going to two different school during the summer. I'm taking an English class and the second half of Anatomy and Physiology. I can't wait till the summer is over so I can have some rest from school work.

      Our church youth group has a firework stand this year, so if you going out to Quinlan stop in buy something. I have worked two different days there and it has been a blast. We are hoping to at least make $2000 off the stand. This is our first year and we are talking about doing it again next year. Once we are established and people find out that our prices are cheaper or the same as every where else we'll be able to make more. Hope everyone is having a safe and fun 4th.     HAPPY 4TH OF JULY

      Last December we went to a part of Juaraz, Mexico called Tierro Nuevo. In this area of Juaraz we built two houses. The people living here are living in homes made out of packing flats and cardboard. When there is a fire it will take out several blocks of homes in just a few short hours. Building these homes for these families indescribable. The homes we are building are being&nbsp;made out of cinder blocks. The people living in Tierro Nuevo are people coming up from southern part of Mexico for jobs in the factories. Most of these families dayly wages hardly cover the taxes for the land they live on, so finding money to pay for house to built is out of the question.  Pictures

      I can't believe the summer is almost over. I'm two weeks into the second Semester of summer school. I have my first test in A&P tomorrow. I don't know if I'm going to be ready. I've been studying hard, but so much is riding on this class. I must make at least a B, but I would like to make an A. An A always helps with the GPA.

      I'm going to be moving on the weekend of August 6 and 7.  I would love to have some help.  I finally found an apartment. It's great. I can't wait to move. It's right across the street from the campus so I don't have to buy a parking pass. I can't believe this is really going to happen. I finally get to move out. Hopefully this will be the for the last time. No more moving back home. I'm taking everything with me this time.

      I just found out today that a friend from high school's father died this past week. He was 62 years older not much older than my own father. He was at church last week and doing just fine. They say he died from a massive heartatack. We went to the funeral there were so many people there. I forgot how large of family he had. Not only were there a lot of family, but friends. He owned the local used car lot and was large part of our community.

      Last night Jen and I were suppose to go meet some friends for a birthday party at Lush 1520 Greenville Ave., Dallas. I hate that place I will NEVER&nbsp;EVER go back and be humiliated like that again. We stood out side for about 30 minutes the friend we were meeting came outside to try and get us in and could not. I would never recommend anyone to go there to stand in line and feel crappy the way I did tonight. So we went up the street another bar and called the people that we were going to be meeting. They said we'll be down there in a little bit well an hour passed and there was no sign. I called him to find out where he was and got no answer on the cell so I text messaged him got no response.&nbsp;After about another hour or so&nbsp;we decided it was&nbsp;time to leave. So I call my friend that's still at the party to let him know that we are going, I get no answer. As the night goes on I called 30 minutes after the bars close and get no answer. I'm hating life right about now. Rejected because I don't look the part to get into the club and rejected by the boy that we were suppose to meeting. I know it wasn't his fault that we couldn't get in and it was his friend's party, so I could never really ask him to leave. I just wish that life wouldn't be so hard.

      Today at church was the one year anniversary of the dedication of our Family Life Center. We all wore some sort of&nbsp;denim. Our District Superintendent was at church so this was the best sermon that I've heard out of our preacher since he came. Other great things about church is that we sang great old hymns and heard great old hymns sung. After church we had lunch at the church, hamburgers YUM. While we were eating we serenaded by great old hymns and gospel music, by a gentleman from our church. All together church made up for such a horrible evening.
