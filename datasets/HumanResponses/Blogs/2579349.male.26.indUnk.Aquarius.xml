      today the last day of the year and everything is different than this year started out, of course, one should expect that, but what has happened is as unexpected as a worm in the cornflakes, because you see that the people around you at the beginning of things, the beginning of the year, aren't there when the thing winds up, when the year ends.  who do you kiss at new year's, and what does it matter, when nothing is certain about it at all, that kiss, the night when people all around you are cheering and yelling simply because time passes, time passes like it does any other day at any other time while kissing any other person, but we kiss anyways and kiss and kiss and thinking this kiss is some kind of certainty, some kind of contract that says yes i will be there to do this again the next time, but the next time comes and there isn't that same kiss anymore, but maybe a new kiss that might seem to say the same thing as the last kiss, saying i will try to be there the next time, but this is no contract, this kiss, this kiss is nothing but another kiss as seconds slip by seriously and slowly, but we always do it, kissing, when the old year passes away and we look forward to new calenders, new planners, new dates on our checks we write to the gas company, and all of this time, this new year, begins with a kiss that seems to say i promise, but really doesn't promise anything at all.  and it's not so sad really.  you can try to count time, with a watch, with a calender, with the fingers on your hand, but you can't capture it really, in these numbers, because it is nothing, time is nothing, it isn't like water that pours through your fingers, it isn't like air that brushes your face, time is nothing like that, instead it is just something we see happen, like we see our bodies get old, we see trees change colors in the fall, but it is just time, nothingness, slipping and slipping, second by second, over and over and things happen, there is a past and future and now, but all the while we count what we can't really even see, time, so why do we bother to cheer it going away or coming, why do we watch a crystal ball drop from the sky to say happy new year when every second is really a year away from some other second, isn't every second a new year?  also, disregarding time now, you can't blame people for being mad.  you can only say so much before you start to make a mistake, before you start to say something you shouldn't, before you tip the scales for someone and you see part of you slipping in their sight and you see what was glowing bright dim a little, so you have to be careful and back off, taking more care with things, with people, because talking can be trouble, if we were silent it would be easier, but silence is not an option.  this is making no sense.  zoloft, prozac, imipramine, effexor, xanax, ativan, valium, trazadone.  i've been on all of these, and not one of them can help me sort anything out.  and you can talk and talk and talk all you want and nothing you say can fix anything the way it needs to be fixed.  you just find yourself in more trouble.  and then people think you are just making an excuse.  truth is that you aren't making any excuse at all, you just can't help how the chemicals in your tissues work.  you can't control your tears.  you can't even control the volume of your voice.  so you just end up spending all your energy patching things up, trying to fix what is undone, and that whole time you are missing out on the things everyone else takes for granted.  it's been a good year, though.  really.

      you can't make me do anything, but  urlLink she  did, she made me do this and i had no control over it, she says i should start a blog and so what do i do but start a blog, it's like mind control, something like jedi stuff, she can sometimes just swoop into my head and convince me of most anything, and i listen, maybe it is weakness, or maybe she is right and i am just too bored to do anything but listen to her, or maybe it is just that she is right about everything, maybe, but at any rate here i am writing and writing and specifically aiming for nothing at all, just trying to put words down, more and more so that something significant comes out of the nothingness, the void, look at me being all melodramatic, sounding like beckett or something, nothing at all to it, you just write and whatever comes out comes out, and i don't need to be so melodramatic, point is she told me to start a blog, so here it is, a blog, and i won't spell check it or make it make sense, i will just write what i want to write at this moment, all in the moment, but not for any philosopical reason, no, just because this is what seems to be working at this moment, moment by moment, she says start a blog, so i did.

      essentially what i am sick of is people and their stupid careers.  every morning putting on their neckties or fancy shoes and shoving off in their fancy cars, cutting off everyone on the road so they make it in by the 9:00 start time, and all the while sipping their morning coffee out of silver on-the-go mugs.  everyone has a "career path," or some other silly corporate life-goal, and essentially all it is is a way to make that person a greedier more selfish person.  everything is money.  money.  money.  people spending their lives making 5 digits so that their boss can make 6.  a chain of command of people caring about useless products, useless commercials, useless everything, when what these people SHOULD be worrying about is the fact that by the time they die they will have left no mark on this world but having had participated in some corporate cycle that makes everyone nameless and heartless.  but perhaps i am just bitter.

       i don't really feel like writing today   i am sort of dizzy this morning.  and kind of crabby, too.  there is just way too much snow outside, and it took forever to get into work again because everyone drives so slowly in the snow DESPITE the fact that it is something we have been dealing with on a daily basis already and everyone SHOULD know how to drive in the stuff by now.  i have these two marbles at my desk.  i am drinking lady grey tea by twinings.  i'm pretty much afraid of people.  my cat has her own email address.  she regularly sends email to people.  last night my class discussed john cheever's "the swimmer."  everyone seemed to think the swimming symbolized the main character's drowning himself in his alcoholism.  one student thought he had a gambling problem.  another one thought he was on drugs.  i do not know where they get these things.  i don't tell them these things.  but, nevertheless, they come up with this stuff out of the blue.  which is fine, i suppose.  it isn't doing anyone any harm.  but i think, though, that it simply shows how dreadfully carelessly people actually read things.  people should care more about what they read.  and, moreso, people should care more about what they write.  but, then again, i am just being an idiot, pompous fool.  my telephone hasn't rung for three days.  i like the idea that you can look into the sky and stare at a star and somewhere someone you love can be looking at that very same star from some very different place.  what creeps me out though is to think that that star is actually a massive ball of hyrdrogen gas churning and churning in continuous nuclear explosions, that any stone or element that comes into its space is instantly vaporized into the very building blocks of matter.  and that around that star are likely planets whirling in the empty void, some even with life other than what we know.  that millions upon millions of miles away some alien creature could be looking into the sky and see my star, the sun, as nothing but a speck of light in the blackness.

            seeing differently   last night i lectured at the university.  my lecture focused on a short story called "cathedral" by raymond carver.  the point of my lecture was that it is important to be able to see things differently, to have, as it were, a second look at things...a look more focused, perhaps, and perhaps even slightly askew from the first glance.  so, today i am offering a very short list of readings that, in my opinion, suggest to the reader that it is important to look at familiar, ordinary, or even difficult situations and topics differently, with a new eye.  "cathedral" - raymond carver  the lives of animals  - j.m. coetzee "a very old man with enormous wings" - gabriel garcia marquez  the truth in painting  - jacques derrida (not particularly focused on this topic, but akin to it, perhaps)    on randomness  somehow  urlLink HER  blog is getting out of control.

      this weekend i went to a psychic to have my palms read.  it was an interesting event, no doubt, but i was stunned at how very different the psychic's surroundings were from my long-held assumptions.  i have always believed psychics and their kin to be holed up, as it were, in a small room, surrounded by beads and jewels, scarves hanging from the walls, the room darkened, lit only by candles and a small shaded lamp, the air full of incense, tones of deep purple and red, a dark fabric draped over a small, round table topped with a crystal ball.  but my psychic had none of these things.  instead she was in an upscale part of town, in a small apartment atop a starbucks.  we stepped into the main room and it was practically empty but for a few chairs and a television set on a folding chair, showing not any bizarre psychic-like program, but a steven segal movie set in appalachia.  the walls were oak-toned slatboards, lined with empty glass shelves.  the whole place had the air of a one-time aerobics studio, complete with a full-length mirror on one wall.  the psychic's office, however, was perhaps more fitting to my preconceived psychic notions.  on her desk were two large amethyst geodes, tarot cards, and a jade statue of the virgin mary.  against the walls were two bookcases,  but they were filled with things i would not have expected a psychic to have.  from top to bottom the cases were filled with roman catholic statuettes, the most plentiful icons being those of the virgin mother of christ.  she read my palms.  i held them upturned on her desk.  she looked at each one and told me some things.  i recently found a new love in my life.  i would be going to chicago.  a couple of years ago i made a very tough decision.  i would have two sons.  and i would somehow be surrounded by children one day.  the general sorts of statements that at once seem very ordinary, but upon soaking in the brain for some time, seem to make sense.  i left wondering, had this woman really seen my life in my palms?  how did she know about the new girl?  how did she know i was planning on going to chicago?  will i have two sons?  but, then again, she didn't even look like a psychic.  she had no crystal ball.

          a scene from this morning   this morning as i walked to my car, the cold air stinging, i saw the most beautiful thing.  a mother, she couldn't have been more than 30, held in one arm a small baby, wrapped snuggly in a pink jacket, a hood protecting its head from the cold, and at her other side a young boy, he must have been a kindergarten child, who was tightly bound from head to knees in an over-sized winter coat.  the young boy wrestled his pull-along school bag over the mounds of snow on the apartment complex's parking lot.  the three of them stood there, waiting for the school bus it seems, a kind of triptych.  three lovely faces, each framed by their hoods on a cold, ugly winter day.  each face a kind of story, or perhaps a kind of song, the kind of song that starts low and builds until it not only fills your ears but fills your heart as well.  the kind of song that sounds celestial, as if written by heaven itself for you and only you.  i got in my car and put in a cd.  it doesn't matter what the music was on that cd because i had those faces.  i had that tiny little scene.  i had three beautiful reasons to go on today.  three reasons that will never know my name or face, nor never know what they have done for me.  three hearts beating.  three.    a poem for someone   first snow  the first snow always falls nervously, thick flakes in front of the steetlight, clinging to branches, as if it wants its very weight to pronounce its presence here with you and me, us warm in your apartment, you watching these nervous flakes flicker in front of the orange lamp outside, the window glass casting no reflection.  and next to you, my arm wrapped like a lover around your soft shoulders, i sit, nervously pretending to watch a movie in spanish, pretending not to stare at you, watching the snow, watching the window, watching where once another man moved and watched you in the same soft light.  ©2003 Eleven

          in college, my friend and i were invited to see a production of  Into the Woods  at the local institute of music.  we were to meet our friends (who held the tickets) before the production in the lobby of the theater .  that's where we first saw her.  at first glance there was nothing particularly significant about this young woman.  she had close-cut blonde hair, wore a brown skirt and matching blouse, had a faint scar on the left side of her face.  but, it was what she wore in her hair that marked her.  above her left temple, fastened with a bobby pin onto the fading edge of her trendy, parted hair she wore a small butterfly...a monarch so delicate and fragile it appeared as though it might, at any moment, lift from her scalp and take to the air.  she stood in the lobby, across from us, patiently waiting and looking out the window into the sun.  her arms folding and unfolding, her skirt casually clinging to her hips.  she was the first butterfly girl...the kind of girl that seemed to light upon a scene only momentarily as she sucked the sweet nectar of life from wherever she was and then fluttered away to some other flower.  she stood in that lobby, the sun through the window lit her hair, and we were awestruck.  and as though she had landed for only a moment, she soon disappeared into the darkness of the theater and we lost her forever into the blinding lightlessness of those rows of seats.  from then on we have had the term "butterfly girl" to use on the rare, very rare, occassions when we see a girl so beautiful and precious that it is as though she is made of air itself.  the kind of girl that sort of just floats onto a scene, her brilliant colors illuminating the landscape, her delicate wings barely pulsing against the current of the breeze.  the kind of girl that lands only momentarily on an otherwise inconspicuous flower and then lifts to the sky, fluttering in seemingly chaotic patterns so beautiful you want to catch her and hold her and make her promises that you can bring her every flower she will ever need.  the kind of girl you have in your presence for but a moment, yet for which you are forever grateful for having just been able to glimpse at her splendid, splendid wings.

      the sun is out today for the first time in a long time, and it feels good.  there are too many days  urlLink here  when the sky is grey and hangs low and oppressive over the earth.  it is a drain on the soul.  sometimes you really believe you make the right decisions.  you press forward with your life and do what seems to be right every step of the way, and then you find out that what seemed to be right wasn't really right at all, in the long run.  and it is the long run we should be watching out for.  but it's hard: we are such short-sighted creatures.  ( urlLink link )  sometimes my life feels like a movie.  it's as though, ever so faintly, i can hear a soundtrack swelling somewhere, the next scene just on the horizon.

      last night it snowed far too much, and a friend who was supposed to come over opted out due to the weather.  i understood, of course, so i decided to walk over to my apartment complex gym to walk the treadmill.  once there and walking on the treadmill, i noticed a middle-aged fellow on another machine.  he seemed to be a pro at exercising because he was completely excessive with detail: tight shorts; tight t-shirt; water bottle; tv tuned to cnn; headset radio; fancy exercising sneakers; a slip of paper detailing each of the exercises he would do that day.  he made me nervous.  all i wanted to do was walk the treadmill for fifteen minutes or so, but his preparation and detail made me feel improper.  i had on a pair of cargo shorts, an anti-george bush t-shirt, and some old tennis shoes.  i wasn't dressed the part.  i had no water bottle.  no little slip of paper to tell me what to do next.  all i had was the inclination that i am getting too fat and that i must do something about it.  so i walked the treadmill, sweating as i did, all the while feeling as though i didn't belong there, as though i had come to the party dressed all wrong and with beer no one liked.  so i finished my walk and got out of there as soon as i could.  this little event spoke volumes to me.  am i always not dressed the part?  should i care as much as others do about things seemingly so trivial?  should i have a water bottle and fancy sneakers?  moreso:  is there something i'm not doing right?

       today i'm soliciting questions.  hit my comments link and leave me a question you want me to answer in tomorrow's post.  i'll answer anything.   three interesting quotations from literature:  "perhaps they have said me already, perhaps they have carried me to the threshold of my story, before the door that opens on my story, that would surprise me, if it opens, it will be I, it will be the silence, where I am, I don’t know, I’ll never know, in the silence you don’t know, you must go on, I can’t go on, I’ll go on." Samuel Beckett,  The Unnamable   "'God damn it,' he said, 'there are nice things in the world -- and I mean  nice  things.  We're all such morons to get so sidetracked.  Always, always referring every goddam thing that happens back to our lousy little egos.'" J.D. Salinger,  Franny and Zooey   "He gives a great groan of despair.  What am I to do? he thinks.  If only I were in touch with my heart, might it be given to know?  Yet it is not the heart he has lost touch with but the truth.  Or--the other side of the same thought--it is not the truth he has lost touch with at all: on the contrary, the truth has been pouring down upon him like a waterfall, without moderation, till now he is drowning in it.  And then he thinks (reverse the thought and reverse the reversal too: by such Jesuitical tricks must one think nowadays!): Drowning under the falls, what is it that I need?  More water, more flood, a deeper drowning." J.M. Coetzee,  The Master of Petersburg

      on account of my gorging on pizza and ice cream last night, i have resolved to begin exercising.  i went to the gym at my apartment complex.  it was empty and i rode the stationary bike while watching cnn from a monitor dangling from the ceiling.  since i haven't exercised at length for some time, i couldn't go very long on the bicycle, so i switched the treadmill to build my stamina...and i was still able to watch cnn from the monitor hanging from the ceiling.  none of this is very interesting, i know.  but it  is  what i did last night, so i might as well tell someone.  i really wish more people would leave me comments.  even if they are mean comments.   urlLink She  told me it wasn't really my tattoo that itched, but the stubbly little hairs that were growing in from the shaving that was done prior the the tattooing.  dammit, she was right.  she tends to be right, most of the time.  but, lest her head get any bigger than it already is, i won't say any more about her "right-ness."  ob-la-di ob-la-da.

      a long day, and the room was muggy, so i got that sticky feeling.  not a sweaty feeling, but a sticky feeling.  the kind of feeling that is as though the air is thick with dampness and your clothes are not fitting right.  trained for  urlLink seven  hours.  they train us here at work, like  urlLink creatures of habit .  they do not  urlLink educate  us, which they should like to do, i would think.  it's  urlLink icy outside , and that contrasts with the  urlLink muggy air inside .  these kinds of  urlLink contradictions  are becoming tiresome to me.  if it is cold, it should be cold throughout.  if it is too warm, it should be too warm throughout.  no more of this.  another thought:  mostly, things are like this poem:   AT NORTH FARM   Somewhere someone is traveling furiously toward you, At incredible speed, traveling day and night, Through blizzards and desert heat, across torrents, through    narrow passes. But will he know where to find you, Recognize you when he sees you, Give you the thing he has for you? Hardly anything grows here, Yet the granaries are bursting with meal, The sacks of meal piled to the rafters. The streams run with sweetness, fattening fish; Birds darken the sky. Is it enough That the dish of milk is set out at night, That we think of him sometimes, Sometimes and always, with mixed feelings?  © 1987  urlLink John Ashbery      list of things possible to have for dinner tonight: macaroni and cheese; rotini with red sauce;  urlLink pizza ; veggie burger; chopped vegetables; toasted bread with peanut butter.  last night it was toasted bread with  urlLink peanut butter .  perhaps again.  once more with these feelings.

      i feel dizzy today.  i keep rubbing my eyes, but the dizziness does not go away.  one of those dizzies like you feel like you need something to drink, like drinking something will make it go away.  water.  anything.  there are a lot of things that have so much potential but fall short.  take the movie i watched last night for example.  it concerned itself with the "what if" factor; the main character's life was shown in two ways, one part being "what if" she had made the subway train, the other "what if" she didn't make the subway train.  and in this simple questioning there was so much potential.  but, the wheels of romantic comedy were spinning way too fast in this one, and the ending resulted two-fold: in one she died, in the other she runs into prince charming.  typical, to say the least.  but the premise was good.  so.  what if?  i say, "so what?"  can't dwell on those things, those "what ifs."  dwelling on that prohibits us from really moving forward.  we can sit and ponder for fun's sake, sure, but to get too caught up in what might be if only we had... well, that, of course, can be paralyzing.  we musn't torture ourselves with those things.  we are our own best torturers, by the way.

          She looked at me!  She looked at me today, and her look burnt up my skin like a hot tight fart lit on fire by a college jock showing off for his friends.  My pants got tight in that special place and I had to cross my legs beneath the computer desk so she wouldn't notice.  But I could see it in her eyes--she noticed and she wanted it all.  That perky, blond trainer with tits tight as frozen strawberries; ass like two soft gleaming dollops of Cool Whip.  Oh yes.  The dame was hot for me and I was ready and willing to melt down her strawberry Sunday if she just said the word...     And she did.  And the word was "Ukelele."       Right there, in the middle of all those people, she ran her tongue ever so lightly and damply over her ferrari-red lips and let the word fall off her tongue like man-juice from a crack-whore's mouth.  "Ukelele."  For extra emphasis, she let out a low moan mid-syllable and looked at me from beneath her lowered lashes.  "Uke-*gasp*-lele."  Oh baby, did I want her to pluck MY strings, to tune MY mini-guitar, to...  well, you get the point.     But the dame was bad news from the very beginning.  Bad news like when that doctor told you that bump on the end of your johnson was beginning to grow its own teeth and was more of a man than you'd ever be.       She wore her badness like a cheap pair of nylons, twitching her ass each time she used the laser pointer to emphasize her next point about Phoenix.  And each twitch had the sound of my name on it.  "Elev-en."  "Elev-en."  "Elev-en."     And when the constant chanting of her ass caused some mad cow of a dame in the audience to ask her to keep it down because she couldn't hear the training, she bent slowly over until I could see her magic tunnel and flipped her blond hair over her shoulder with a wink.  The mad cow of a dame looked confused of course, but then I saw that she ALSO had to cross her legs and hide her lap beneath her desk.  It was then that I realized the true extent of the blond dame's powers.     I managed to hang around after the training with a question about "coding" and the "presentation of publication materials."  The dame was quick on her toes...  She answered my question about "coding" and told me that she imagined my publication materials were DAMN good and that I had nothing to worry about.  (NOTE--She was right about that one;  despite my size 9 shoes, I AM quite well-endowed when it comes to  "publication materials.")  She acted as though such questions were everyday ones that she received from ALL her students.  But I knew she understood what I secretly meant--especially after I clarified by hoarsely whispering, "My ass--your face.  Bring it on."     She ran her hand slowly down her abdomen which was packed tight as a salmon in paper and said, "Your cubicle or mine?"     I chose hers.  And, boy, was her cube a big one, the biggest I've ever seen a dame possess...  I felt a little intimidated at first seeing that I was engulfed by the size of her cubicle, a veritable swizzle stick tossed into the Grand Canyon, but once she started coaching me with what almost seemed to be a slightly bored air, I realized size doesn't matter.*  The fact that she was filing her nails the whole time threw me off a bit, but I think she liked having me in her cubicle after all...  I mean, who wouldn't?  Except for maybe Lauren.  Or Nicole.  Or Natasha.  Or Elizabeth.  Or John.  Or Tia.  Or Sandra.  Or Kiki.  Or Melissa.  Or Janice.  Or Beyonce.  Or Geena.  Or sometimes Delia.  Or Tanya (except for that time she got maced in the eyes accidentally right before, and THEN she was ALL screams).     And right as I was thinking of about 30 more names I could have listed here, the dame clocked me in the head with her keyboard.  After I collapsed into a state of semi-consciousness onto the floor, she pulled out a roll of duct tape.  She began to bind my feet together.  Little did the dame know that this just excited me more.  I grabbed for her icy blond locks with my fist which was still free, and when I tugged, the blond hair came off into my hands.     It was a wig and...     THE DAME WAS IN FACT NED, MY OLD TEAM COORDINATOR!!!!     "Hi, big boy," he said, grinning at me, "Time for you and me to have some good ol' fashioned fun..."  TO BE CONTINUED...  ______________ *Blond dame would like to note that yes, size DOES matter, despite your blog author's assertions otherwise.

      turning the page now, like everyone else, and looking to a new year:  the festivities ended, i turned to bed, but had the most horrible dreams.  it was late when i turned in, and maybe it was on account of the back pain or alcohol, but nonetheless the dreams were vivid and horrible.  and, what's worse, they are the kind of dreams one can only remember as being horrible, without any further detail.  i know they were vivid, for at the time they seemed real.  i know they were horrible, because at times i woke up in cold sweats.  but, regardless, today i cannot really remember any details...although, it was two nights ago.  so, why i wrote this i do not even know.  last night i had a revelation of sorts.  ace said, to hell with them.  so, yeah.  to hell with the family.  tired of falling out of favor, tired of double standards, tired of being told the problem is in my head, etc.  but you do not want to hear this.  you read for other reasons, no?  something entertaining: my kitten burned off her whiskers trying to sniff a candle.  now all that remains on one side of her face are twisted, melted hairs that once were long, delicate whiskers.  i have a wee bit of sparkling wine left from new year's eve.  i should drink it soon, before the fizz has completely taken its leave.  just a reminder to self.  here's this: what i really want to write i am not writing.  there's something for you.  i do not write, here, what i really want to be writing.  thus, you have no idea what i really want to say.  you read this hearing everything but what i want to be saying.  i am talking around what i want to say, then, leaving a hole where the real information should be, where my real purpose rests.  i suppose i am being evasive.  ah, yes, about the potato chips.  i have a small amount left from a party i held about two weeks ago.  they have not yet gone stale, so i eat them when i am hungry for a snack.  the problem is that these potato chips are crumbling.  so, i will be eating them, and as i stick my hand in the bag, they break into smaller chips.  the large ones turn to smaller ones.  the smaller ones turn into even smaller ones, etc.  well, if i keep at this, and the potato chips also keep breaking, i could, in theory, never finish the bag of potato chips.  they could keep breaking into more and more chips, though smaller and smaller, at a rate with which i can not keep up with the eating.  thus, i might say to myself, i will have three potato chips, and upon taking one chip out of the bag, one other breaks into what becomes two potato chips.  i then, on my next two subsequent grabs for chips, pick up the broken chips that were once part of a single chip.  in the process i break two other chips into what becomes four potato chips.  thus, in the event that i eat three potato chips, i have done nothing to dimish the sum amount of potato chips in the bag!  this could, theoretically, go on endlessly.  maybe i should just throw the potato chips away.  it is a new year after all.

        so i'll have these days when i am bumbling along, living what i think is happiness, not pushing any envelopes, just coasting along, satisfied with the way things are and how my life is headed.  and then there are other days.  days when my heart hangs a little lower than usual.  days when my eyes well up and my chest grows tight.  days when i feel like feeling is a little bit too much for me anymore, and there has to be some way to slow the world down a bit.  it's on these kinds of days that i think the most; these kinds of days seem to lend themselves to thinking.  so i think.  i think about a great variety of things.  first and foremost, usually, i think about my divorce.  what it means.  why it happened.  how it hurts.  how i had never really imagined this happening.  how i don't want my ex-wife to be sad.  how much i really never wanted to hurt her.  how much we fought.  how much we grew apart in such a short, short time.  and, these are heavy thoughts, really.  thoughts that take a lot out of me, push me to my limits, and ultimately make me feel down.  i guess it is just a matter of the course of time.  i mean, these kinds of things happen, divorces.  these sorts of things also seem to sort themselves out over time.  and maybe, too, i take things a little bit harder than most folk.  i know i even get choked up thinking about the times, as a young boy, at the elementary school.  i think, perhaps, it is the past that makes me sad.  times gone away, having slipped through our fingers quickly, with our attention so poorly attuned to the details.  and, perhaps, even sadder to me is the fact that there is no possibility of recapturing what is gone, there are only glossy photographs, it seems, that link us to our pasts.  there is nothing otherwise physical.  our bodies change, our moods, our views of things...even our homes change a bit.  nothing can ever stay in the past, stay exactly the way it was at the point we remember loving it the most.  everything is mutable, everything marches on and on, day by day by day.  and that is the problem for me.  it is that change that i cannot seem to handle.  i mean, i see the change, i know it is there.  i sense it happening, i see its results.  but the fact that there is change at all, that one day in may i was the happiest man in the world, in love and married and on my way to mexico and now all that is gone....THAT i cannot handle...that loss, that change the occurred between then and now, that loss of something, that gaining of others, that definite distance between what once was and what is now...those things are too difficult for me.  and every time i look back my heart grows a little bit grayer and the lump in my throat grows a little bit larger.  our present is always changing.  now is never the same.  right now i am typing these words.  now i am typing other words.  now, some more.  minutes tick by and they are always, always different.  but the past...the past is permanent, it does not change.  it stays fixed, there, in the time gone by.  it always stays yesterday, its sunshine always sunny, its downpours always drenching.  the time at the sweaty theme park, eating french fries, watching the parade, well, that time will always be the same.  it will not go away.  and the love, the past love will always be there, lingering.  it will not fade, the past will not let it fade.  it stays, permanently fixed at a point in time, a point no longer occupied by any space but the space in the mind, the space in the mind that can hold, it seems, just about everything and anything it decides.  the more you try to remember something, the harder it seems.  what is difficult to deal with is the stuff you try to forget.  it seems that when you want to remember something, you can't...and the same with forgetting...the more you want to forget, the more you remember.  it is, at once, both a sad and beautiful thing, this tendency of our minds.  like an inflatable tube in a pool, the more we push something we want to forget into the depths, the more violently it shoots itself to the surface.  it is a curious thing, memory...our minds.  it seems to have a will contrary to the heart.  it seems to want to make things more difficult for the heart.  it seems.

        i experienced a troubling confrontation last evening.  while discussing a definition of "art" with my class last night, i found myself pushing the hot-topic button and discussing the new mel gibson directed flick "the passion of the christ."  i mentioned that this film was very violent, but is still considered a piece of art despite the blood that splashes around in the movie.  i was met with an objection from a female student.  her objection, however, was not formulated in the manner i expected.  i thought she might object to my saying that this film was art, or perhaps might object to the blood-bath on which the movie prides itself.  instead, though, this young girl objected to the fact that i called a movie that depicted jesus of nazareth a "violent" film.  she insisted that, because the movie is religious in subject matter, the film could not be considered violent, despite the fact that the main character is beaten, bruised, and bloodied.  in her opinion, violence was something left to films about war, and the holy topic of this film would not allow the term "violent" to be applied.  of course, i objected to her objection, saying that, despite the religious subject matter of the film, the fact that the film is, indeed, a blood-bath simply shows that the film is a violent one.  her objection left me wondering, "why are some people so hesitant to say something is objectionable, even though it depicts something that has an overtly christian or moral subject?"  it seems as though this young woman was ready to say this movie was NOT objectionable in terms of violence, simply because it depicts the christian savior.  this suggests, then, that this same young woman might say the film IS indeed violent if the main subject was some other person, not the christ, but some other run-of-the-mill person from history.  but, because this man, this film's subject, is jesus of nazareth, the film, to this girl, could not be objectionable.  this young woman drew a line of deduction that said "movies about jesus are not violent movies, despite how much blood is shed in the film."  and, for me, this is a curious construction of logic.  it is one that i am moved to think about, and one that i cannot comprehend.

        last night i drove home late from her place, the streets dark and icy, barely seeing out my front frosty window, the air hard and still like stone, wearing a sport jacket, my shirt underneath untucked, not wearing my belt.  and we had talked a lot about things, what's the worth of a deathbed confession, why don't i eat meat, who am i, who are you, where are we going together, she a little drunk, me completely sober, both of our eyes heavy.  my car streaked across the streets, i made all the lights.  thinking: about the goodnight kiss, sweet.

        last night, for the first time in my life, i actually saw a real live couple kissing under a lamppost.  and really, the more i think about it, it was the loveliest of things.  they were there, under the white light, just holding one another, their faces close.  there is something quietly spectacular about catching moments like these, moments that seem to be from movies, or from deep in the pages of some novel.  and, truthfully, this moment did not seem cliché either.  it seemed real, natural, as if at that moment, right there, all this was supposed to happen this way, and i was supposed to see it, this kiss.  and there is something interesting, too, about this voyeuristic act, my intrusion on this couple's privacy.  for them, no doubt, there was no "other."  there was only themselves, together, under that light, on that cobblestone sidewalk, tight in an embrace, their lips touching.  only themselves.  but, they had done this act in public, where eyes can see, and i (and probably many others) witnessed this act, this kiss, and, in essence, shared this moment with them, each of us seeing what they were doing, and therefore, sharing the event that they seemingly wanted solely to themselves.  so, this moment they shared they shared between themselves and with the rest of the public eye.  and all this makes one think, think very, very hard about how private one can keep a relationship.  because, in close moments like the one i witnessed, the world seems so very far away, those lovers kissing seemed not to know the world was watching, or at least seemed not to care that the world was watching.  but, their love shared was not private.  that kiss was not private.  they shared that kiss with everyone, and now everyone knows of love.  their love cannot be private wholly, because they shared that kiss with everyone who saw it, with me, with the lady at the shop, with the others walking down that street.  the only way, then, to keep a relationship absolutely private is to be absolutely sterile, to share nothing but the knowledge of the relationship.  and, then, there is no relationship at all, but for the knowledge, and we need so much more than the knowing we are in love.  we need the touch.  we need the kisses under the lampposts.  it is almost as though the moment we touch we share a relationship with the rest of the world, and it is nothing private, it is always something public.  what we might not know, however, in this public realm is the strength or shade of the relationship.  and, perhaps this is what is private after all.  what know one can know is how serious or un-serious a relationship is between two people.  that cannot be told by the voyeuristic act of watching one kiss, seeing one embrace, witnessing the holding of hands.  so to say a relationship is private is to say the degree of the relationship is private, not the sharing of lives itself.  a relationship is something difficult to hide but also something intensely private.  a kiss under a lamppost tells the world everything and nothing at all.

      today is a sunshine-day here in cleveland.  a rare one for the winter.  the temperature is mild, and i even drove to work this morning with my sunroof open, letting the fresh air spill into my car as i sped along the freeway.  i like days like today, days when every cd you listen to sounds new again.  days when the sun gets in your eyes but doesn't really bother you.  days when it is nice to put down the window and you are ok with getting stuck in traffic.  days like these are nice.  so much of our moods depends on the weather.  i've been running out of things to say lately.  perhaps that is a good thing.

        i drink a lot of coffee.  too much actually.  during the course of the past couple of weeks i have tried to cut down my intake to only a couple of cups a day.  so far, so good.  i am down to about three cups a day, which is great, considering that i was drinking up to eight cups a day at one point.  this cut-back is dramatic, i think.

        today has been a particularly troubling day.  i woke up with a slight hang-over, my head a bit fuzzy, my mouth dry.  i stumbled in the shower, scratched my hand on the wall, and barely made it out the door before my cat scooted free of the apartment.  these were the simpler trials, the less troubling events, of my day.  these i could handle.  the drive into work wasn't very troubling either.  i made my way on the freeway with ease, changes lanes a few times, but they were smooth changes, and i was able most quickly to glide to work in my american-made automobile.  even driving today was easy.  what has been harder, however, is the pressure within me.  the pressure.  you see, i am an american.  i exist in a market economy built on capitalistic principles.  i work 40 hours a week to make a meager, and i mean meager, 5 digit salary. i pay creditors who charge interest upon interest for the money i owe them.  i work in an enviroment where my goal is to produce books that bring in revenue that is, by far, greater than nearly twice my salary.  someone, somewhere in this building, is making a 6 digit salary because i will do work to make him/her look as though he/she should be making 6 digits.  i am a cog in the wheel.  i hate dilbert, do not compare me with that.  when i was in washington d.c., the capital of the wealthiest nation on earth, i saw more homeless people than i ever have since.  this nation, this monumental nation, has poor beyond the scope of imagination, but we have spent billions on war.  billions to "free" other people, while our own are starving.  there is no justice in this world.  there is no freedom.  like coetzee writes, that word freedom is nothing more than 7 letters on a slate.  this nation executes prisoners.  let's sick people go without medication.  let's to poor die in the streets.  let's criminal millionaires run free.  this country is made out of greed and corruption and still we call it civilized and the greatest country in the world.  my heart is heavy with these thoughts.  in a land of plenty, so many do without, and it is called fairness.  in a land of science and health, so many are left to suffer and die.  this is disgusting.  this disgusts me like nothing else that is.  it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than it is for this rich country to enter the kingdom of heaven.  leave your comments, if you please...

         urlLink derrida  says that loving a person hinges on the ideas of "who" and "what."  is it "who" we love, or is it "what" about them that we love?  do we love the person for who she is, literally, such as her biological make-up and her ontological existence, or is it what we know about her (her opinions, her ideas, her interests) that attracts us?  this question is interesting, insofar as it artifically reduces a person to who and what, all the while recognizing the complex interaction, even dependence upon, the combination or marriage of who and what in an individual.  it is impossible to conceive of a person without recognizing that who they are seems dependent on what they believe or know, and it is impossible, also, to conceive of a person without recognizing that what they believe or know is dependent on their very ontological existence.  you see, it is an invaginated idea, the who and the what of a person.  for, as we push more and more into what a person is, what she believes and what she knows and what she thinks, the more we realize that this is who the person is.  and the more we push the idea of who a person is, the more we realize we are only speaking of what she is.  there is, then, no one or the other...only both.  only two things that we cannot disconnect, or in other words, only two things that are one thing.  no inside or outside, only both, at once, like a  urlLink moebius strip .  at any rate, this is why it is impossible to speak about love generally.  love is not a general thing, and it cannot be spoken of in those terms.  the point of this is simple.  i love.  that i love, i know.  why i love, i do not know.  but whatever it is about her, i love (whether it be who or what).  and that is enough for me.

        lately i have had restless nights sleeping.  my dreams make rest impossible; vivid dreams that feel as though they are real, and the reality they provide is troublesome.  i do not know what to make of these dreams, these messages from the deepest, darkest parts of my mind.  tonight i am going out to dinner with some good friends in celebration of my birthday.  it is nice that so many people would like to gather to celebrate with me.  someone very, very dear to me made my birthday incredibly special this year.  i thought, having gone through a lot since my last birthday, that this year's celebration would be a more muted, solemn affair, something that would make me sadder than it would glad.  but, this person really made it something worth remembering.  she warmed my heart and made me feel important.  she erased any, any shades of sadness in me and made me feel happy and loved.  i am growing more and more restless with my job.  it is becoming more and more painful to commit myself to this work, and i find myself growing ever more dejected and sour.  the grass is growing under my feet, and perhaps it is time for me to begin to look toward moving on.

        vagina, ukulele, tostitos, arbitrary, surveillance, urinary tract infection, gorging, gorgeous, nebulous, transplendent, nefarious, post office.  a friend asked me to write a blog using those terms.  that seems like a rather committed obligation, to craft some text using words predetermined, words that, until they appear in my text, seem to be rather meaningless, or, more appropriate, seem only to connote whatever the reader will understand them to be until i put them into context.  for example, the undersexed male reader will, i assume (perhaps wrongly) become slightly engaged when he reads the word "vagina" out of context.  what the word would mean, however, should i give it context, is an entirely different issue.  i could write "an elephant's vagina," thereby curbing the more sexual connotation of the word, and ushering in a more biological connotation.  and so on.  i suppose, then, there aren't truly too many limitations when it comes to using these predetermined words.  true, my discussion, commentary, text would have to have a certain slant, being arranged around certain terms, but on the other hand, i can make of those terms what i will.  i can resist common connotation and push the reader towards my own meanings for those words.  i can manipulate my reader, certainly.  so, in essence, these words just "are."  they exist and they depend on the meanings we make for them.  they exist, but they do not exist until we give them meaning.  tomorrow is my birthday, so i will not write.  i have made it a habit not to write anything on my birthday for some time now (at least a couple of years).  it seems fitting that on the anniversary of my birth that i leave no record of my having existed, for what is celebrated on my birthday is the idea that on one day, i came from non-existence into existence, and on that day i left myself no written record.  sure, others left written records--the doctors recorded my birth, the hospital recorded my vital statistics, my mother, even, scratched some notes in her notebook.  but as for me, just fresh from the womb, i left no record at all.  not a single utterance that i even existed.  so, really, there is no real written evidence that i existed even on the day of my birth.  i wrote nothing.  and i will continue to write nothing on my birthdays, so that, when times far beyond me look back to see what i had to say on the anniversary of my birth, there will be nothing.  no record.  and this non-act will, i think, commemorate most appropriately the record of my non-existence.  my record of not-being.  in fact, i even think, that sometimes we try so hard to make something "be," even ourselves, that it turns out these things, even ourselves, aren't anything at all.

        both of us  under our asses the dry grass scratches, its hard brown blades pierce our clothes, meeting our rumpy flesh that yearns to breathe the sugary summer breeze, that yearns to touch the other, our chests heaving in the hot humid air trying to catch our breath while the sun, the giant blossom of the sky, slices the haze and burns our forheads, forcing freckles to flower across our faces.  and there we sit, without holding hands, without an August kiss  under the boardwalk, down by the sea,  and we look in different directions, you watching a dragonfly skim across the thistled field, me watching men unload their trucks,  both of us seeing the same thing.  ©2004 Eleven

        for what it's worth, last night i was going to write a poem.  it was going to be for someone important to me, and i had every intention of sitting down and writing this thing.  i really did.  i had an idea, i know how it would start.  but, as always, other things got in the way.  things far less important, even, then writing poems.  i soaked in a hot tub, for example, where i did nothing but watch my cat tap the water curiously with her paws.  i cleaned up my apartment, putting blankets and pillows from this weekends sleepover back into their places.  i burned a cd.  listened to some music.  i did everything else and did not write this poem.  nothing.  not a word came out of me.  but the idea was in my head all night, and i knew the first lines, for lord's sake.  i knew the first lines.  i won't repeat them here.  it wouldn't be right.  those lines are for that poem...the poem that may or may not ever be written.  and this poem is important to me, it is special, whether or not it ever makes it onto paper, whether or not it ever comes into form.  it just goes to show, however, that sometimes the most important things to us never make it into form...never come into being.  instead they remain locked, safely away in our hearts, kept from the world, kept from being known in any solid way.  and sometimes those treasures are the best treasures after all, the ones only known to you.  sometimes only you should know your lines to your poems...sometimes those words should never leave the fingertips.

        last night i got a call from an old friend.  she hadn't been well and decided that by calling me she might regain some of what she had lost in her life.  she called my old house, where my wife, or more appropriately, soon-to-be-ex-wife, still lives.  during this first call she was told that i didn't live there anymore, that we had separated, i having moved to my own apartment, i having my own new phone number.  the she called my apartment, left me a message, and when i got home i called her back.  it was late and i wasn't sure she would answer.  but she did, and we talked for awhile, catching up with one another's lives, seeing were both of us had been for the past couple of years.  she was ill and had been having a difficult time.  i had a marriage fall apart, moved into my own place, found someone else to hold onto.  changes, it seemed, had occurred.  but our voices were the same, and the same old jokes still played well for this audience.  there was the same old comfortability, the same old inflections on certain words.  a lot was the same.  and i realized the old saying, "the more things change, the more they stay the same," was a little more accurate than i ever realized.  she said to me on the phone, "man, have things changed with you."  i said to her, "no.  not really.  i'm still the same."

        you see, there are certain things in this world that require the utmost delicacy.  for example, one cannot construct a poem without being delicate with words.  one cannot fall in love without treating the other with delicacy.  one cannot begin to understand art without first embracing the delicate, interwoven history and theory that cause a particular piece of art to come into being at a particular point in time.  living itself is a delicate matter.  what is dangerous is when one ignores delicacy.  when one pushes aside that which one should handle with care and rushes to a judgment, a conclusion, a solution.  everything, and i mean everything, can be dealt with a careful, delicate hand.  it is, of course, up to the individual what he treats delicately, what he treats with utmost care.  business tends to lack delicacy.  business is a harlot, a sham money-making enigma bent on self-satisfaction and the easy dollar. business is not delicate with people, ideas, things.  it is the mastermind of the greedy.  instead of care it employs haste and gluttony, quickly pulling into its belly all it can devour in order that grow incredibly (and even irresponsibly) in all directions.  and we, now, because of the state of our world, sit at her table with her, watching her stuff her own and ours down her throat, without care.  but we can still be delicate in our own maneuvers.  and in doing so, we resist her.

          we've all heard it.  each of us rolls our eyes, and shivers in our hearts, when we hear the phrase "ultimately we are all alone."  we've all heard it before, each of us casting it off as a hopeless slogan for hopeless people.  but, still, each of us has had a stirring in our hearts when we hear it--not a good stirring either.  instead, it is a low stirring, the kind of stirring when we know we have heard the truth, and we do not like it.  but, i'll go on the record as saying maybe it isn't so bad at all...to be alone.  indeed we meet our graves with silent, solitary solemnity, each of us being a cold record of our own existence, trapped in our own eternal silence, in our own final box.  certainly this idea causes shivers, maybe even a held back tear.  but it doesn't have to be that way, so sad and bleak.  instead, this loneliness can be happy, even something to rejoice as we tread on in this existence.  alone you can sigh at a sad song, see the delicate colorings of a butterfly, climb a grassy hill.  alone you can touch the bottom of the sea, read a book, learn the geometry of your lover's body.  alone you can smell a rose, see the stars, and walk in the warm glow of the sun.  alone you can have something that no one else can ever have.  all you see and do is yours and yours alone; all you have in your midst is only yours to experience at your will, and there is nothing sad about that.  there is only something beautiful.

        today i was challenged to write a manifesto.  i was challenged to use this writing space to construct a policy, a program, a directive regarding something in particular...that topic being solely up to me.  it was suggested that this topic, however, should be something small.  "the smaller the better," she said to me.  i thought about this for some time, and seriously considered doing this in a droll fashion...taking up some minor topic of little real consequence and inflating its importance in the construction of a hyperbolic manifesto.  however, given my mood today, i don't know that this is the best idea.  it is rainy out today.  a chill in the air.  sure the spring flora are pushing through the little mounds of earth--tulips and daffodils are starting to green the ground around us.  i even saw some small trees budding.  but, still, the weather today rather captures my mood: grey, gloomy, rainy, sad.  i do have a lot to deal with at this stage in my life.  i am on a series of anti-depressants to stabilize my bipolar disorder.  i am going through a divorce.  as a result of being married, i am several thousand dollars in the red.  now, i am only in my mid-twenties and i have already had to deal with life changes that most people do not deal with well into their forties.  but this has to stop.  i can't go on like this anymore.  i go through my days spending much of them in the mire.  i am usually patently unhappy, unsettled, ill-at-ease, and depressed.  but, no more.  i am letting go of this once and for all, and it is starting here.  i write this blog not for any audience.  i write it for myself, as a kind of therapy, a way to let loose with my feelings and thoughts without having to talk to an over-priced professional therapist.  and, if you have read any of these blogs, you often find me bemoaning some aspect of my existence...or analyzing other parts of my existence...all in all using this space to write about what is getting me down, making me sad, making me mad.  it has become a cry-baby post for me, and this is never what i had intended.  it is time, then, in this spring season, to start afresh.  to give up crying about the past and start looking toward the future.  to give up dragging around the weights and chains of my yesterdays, and begin reveling in the joy of my tomorrows.  it has been long enough now.  i have lived through this long, cold winter...it is time in this season of renewal to renew myself, my life, my world, my sight.

        so you think that everything is relative.  that what you do is relative to your place and time and the great holy over-spirit, all depending on circumstance and what is where and who and how, when and why.  that death is death or life, depending on how you look at it.  that that man or everyman is good or bad depending on what you know about him, his whats and wheres and whys and everything you do and don't know about everything at all.  that everything is a piece of something larger falling together somehow, and with nothing good or bad or right or wrong, but just being and seeming and depending on what angle you see it from.  everything is a bit over the top or a bit understated or not said at all, depending, that is, on who is listening.  we look at the object as relative when, perhaps, it is the subject that is relative, the you and i and he and she or whichever mind makes whatever it makes of things around it.  maybe its not that act that is good or bad or, depending on which way you look at it, right or wrong, but maybe it is the way we look at looking at it, whether or not that is the right way or wrong way or just one way of seeing in a million of our own ways of seeing.  maybe seeing is skewed or off from day to day, a bit of play in the rope, a slack in the eye, giving room to new or other or old ways of seeing the same thing from the same angle only a different color or shade.  seeing the act itself not relative, but the inner sight that is arbitrary, or better, playful, making the black and white hard to see clearly (and there is no grey area, really, only a rainbow), but not blurring them either, just making them difficult to distinguish, like orange from red and violet from blue, black from navy.  or see the world the way the dog sees it: new every day.

        i am having a difficult day today.  sure, the temperature outside is mild, so i can't complain about snow and cold temperatures.  sure things are looking up for me, and i am happy about that.  but all in all, i am having a difficult day.  today i am irritated by people.  it isn't that i have a problem with people...that i generally don't like them or anything.  in truth, i do really like people and enjoy their company.  but something today has soured me to the general population.  i think, perhaps, it is the rudeness of people that i cannot take anymore.  always on the road there are people cutting others off, merging into other lanes while on their phones, not courteous behind the wheel.    while shopping, rude people are everywhere.  they brush into you with their bags in a hurry to get somewhere, failing to say excuse me.  they block aisles with their carts, take their time walking, blocking lanes, or push and shove while in line, violating personal space.  people are rude at work, cutting throats to make the little gains they can in the workplace, each person thinking s/he is somehow in charge of the other's actions.  i just can't take this anymore, this uncivilized society where common courtesy has flown out the window to selfish motives and what seems to be a kind of intentional rudeness.  it sickens me.  it saddens me.  i can't take it anymore.

        when i was little, my grandmother used to give me the comic page from the newspaper on sundays.  the comics were in color.  she would also give me a sheet of wax paper and a spoon.  if you put the sheet of wax paper on top of the comics and then rubbed the wax paper with the edge of the spoon, the wax would pick up the coloring from the newsprint, and on the wax paper you would have a copy, in color, of the comics on the page.  now, i don't know if this old trick still works.  something tells me that wax paper might not be as waxy as it was 25 years ago, or that the ink they use in the newspapers now is far superior, and less rub-off-able, than the ink they used back then.  but regardless, the trick did work when i was little.  she's been dead now nearly 23 years, my grandmother, and still, quite vividly, i can remember the times making these wax paper copies of comics on her kitchen floor.  i can, indeed, remember how the spoon felt, scraping along the waxy paper, each stroke transferring more and more of the underlying image to the wax paper.  now that i think about it, that act was like an act of memory.  you see, when you transferred the image to the wax paper, the image never was very bold.  not a great deal of the newspaper ink made the jump from the newsprint to the wax paper.  instead on the wax sheet you got a ghostly, pale representation of the comic image.  one that was visible, sure, but something that could not replace the original image on the comic page.  that is how our memory seems to work.  you see, we live our days, we experience events.  we fall in love, we have fights, we see people die.  we watch the news, we ARE the news.  we laugh and love with our friends and family.  and ALL of these events are real when they happen.  they are real, they exist, they can be touched and felt and heard and tasted and seen with the naked eye.  but once they are gone, all we have is a kind of wax paper image of them left over.  something a little bit hazy that doesn't look as strong as the original.  something that we can see and define as an event, but something, too, that is a ghost...that is nothing but a pale representation of what once was.  our memories are good, but not THAT good.  we cannot remember each and every detail of things.  we try, but we can't.  we cannot be sure of all the senses we once had when something occurred.  that is all obscured by the memory, made pale by the passing of time.  you see, as hard as i rubbed the wax paper with that spoon, as many times i went over the same small comic, i could never get as solid a picture as the original.  it makes one pause and think about how we should hold on to our own original moments with a tight grip and not leave ourselves to hold on to memories alone.  instead, we should focus ourselves on the present...on what is at hand...because what is at hand is the clearest, most detailed image we can ever have, and once it is gone we are left with nothing more than ghosts of what once was.

        there were lots of fun times.  like the first time i went to her hometown, pittsburgh, to see her.  she made me a pizza, a pizza she made for me periodically throughout our life together as a gentle reminder that she loved me.  there was the honeymoon in mexico, along the gulf, soaking up the sun, arguing over prices with the mexican merchants, visiting the ruins together, swimming and drinking and loving. there was the house we bought together, the two of us putting all of ourselves into making a home together.  there were the dinner parties we threw, the happy times with friends.  the soft, quiet christmases, spent together under the light of christmas trees, little gifts that mattered more than their size.  there was the dog and cat we shared, like our babies so small.  and, too, there were bad times.  too many of those.  and now, well, it's all gone.  it's all nothing but memories.  memories that keep me up at night...with tears in my eyes.

       today's guest topic is suggested by lauren spisak:     if the "brain in the vat" theory ( urlLink http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-in-a-vat_theory ) is true and all that we perceive as reality is not necessarily as it seems, what implications would this have for you?   to be certain of my consciousness is difficult, of course.  we are all dependent upon assuming that our waking life is truly reality as we know it.  the question here is, what IF waking life as i know it is really just my brain, in a jar, stimulated by electrodes...etc.  this would mean that everything i know, touch, feel (emotion), hear, taste, see, smell is all imaginary.  fake.  unreal.  clearly this could present a problem...but only if i knew that this was the case.  you see, the fact of the matter is that i would not know this to be the case at all, so everything i "did" as a result of electrodes being triggered in patterns making me think certain things would be, really, real to me.  so, in short, my answer is that the implications are rather ordinary.  since i would not know the difference, i would not care if this was the case at all.  but this brings to mind a different consideration, something that i think we should be more careful about.  this calls into question the very nature of thought and living.  for, if i was only a brain in a vat being stimulated by electrodes, would my thought, as clearly conceived as it is, constitute a kind of "life" for me.  that is, would i be alive in the same way we say a man is alive that walks on the street whistling a tune?  in essence, we are all brains in a vat, really.  our brains are set in our heads, connection to millions of electrodes (our nerves) that respond to external stimuli, resulting in our thought being constructed in the manner it is.  the question then becomes, "is this life?"  and, furthermore, "should we be treating life in this manner?"  conscious life is a curious thing.  we have no way, really, to prove we are conscious, as this brain-in-the-vat idea shows.  we have no way to be sure life isn't simply a construction of our imaginations or what have you.  what we DO know, however, is that there is something going on.  that we are not inert objects, but, at most, objects that can think.  this, we can say, is the proof of life.  that we think proves, at least, that we are alive in some respect.  we have a functioning system of thought.  if this does constitute life, then we must consider the very preciousness of this gift.  what i am getting at here is that, if i am just a brain in a vat, my life as i know it the result of electronic stimuli on the surface of my brain, then, well, i think it best if my experimenters cease with this experiment.  life is too precious, in my mind, to be dealt with so flippantly.  if these experimenters ARE indeed experimenting on my brain, my brain in a vat, stimulated by electrodes, i would hope that they realize how they are playing with life, teasing a man into believing he is real, with real pains, real loves, a real heart.  i would hope they realize...or come to realize...how cruel they are being to life itself, teasing it into a simulated reality, teasing it into believing that in this world it IS making other people smile, filling their hearts with joy, feeling their touches.  to say such comforts and joys are not real and will be never be true physical manifestations of events is cruel.  it is, indeed, an injustice to the soul itself.  the soul that searches for something higher, something lovely, something real.

        today started like any other.  the alarm went off.  i reset it to go off later.  it went off later.  i hit snooze about 4 times.  the cat on my bed, purring, forcing her soft head under my hands, forcing me to pet her.  last night was with her.  ice cream and monopoly.  a glass of wine.  no snow last night.  the ground cold, dry.  this morning, though, last night was gone and there was snow everywhere, stuck even to the tree branches, the ground now cold and wet.  this morning, after waking, i brushed my teeth, showered.  the cat poking her head into the shower watching the water fall.  drip, drip, and her eyes totally focused on each drop of water, like she wants to catch them and kill them.  instinct i guess, or just a fascination with water.  or both.  the car covered with snow.  brush it off.  it's cold and my thin jacket doesn't block much.  doesn't even insulate.  get into the car, and i have no gas.  first stop: gas station.  i put in 11 dollars and some odd cents of gas.  i charge it.  so far in debt now, what does it matter if i charge one more thing?  leftovers from the marriage.  the marriage that will be officially over very soon.  sooner than i think.  back in my car, and the freeway is slow.  slower than normal.  people nervous in the slush.  afraid they'll slip.  and suv cuts me off.  god do i hate suvs.  everyone gets stupid when driving an suv.  maybe it's just rudeness, though.  whatever.  slow goings to work today.  the sky white-out, snow snow snow and it doesn't look like it will stop anytime soon today.  just keeps coming.  it figures.  spring will refuse to come this year when i need it most.  so, at work.  checking pages.  making sure the new copy of the book hasn't lost any material.  have to check words against words.  for the same words.  monotonous, boring.  actually, aggravating.  shouldn't be doing this really.  should be something greater.  a poet, maybe.  a world famous poet who makes money by being a poet.  no.  there are none of those anymore.  yes, today is just like any other.  everything the same as it was yesterday, only we are one day ahead.  and it's not just the work.  it's moreso the living that has become tedious.  when you are not having fun, you are not having fun, no matter what you do.

        this weekend i was witness to what i want to call an "event."  i went to a concert at which i was clearly in the minority.  a rather poor generalization:  the band, feminist lesbians; the crowd, mostly young, homosexual chicks; me, heterosexual male.  you see, i was a minority.  and being a minority is a fine thing.  i am lucky, though.  one of the majority.  one of the favorable types...white, middle class, college educated, christian, heterosexual, male.  i get all the social "perks" that come with the territory.  so, being forced to be a minority in a particular situation is, well, in a way, refreshing.  differs my perspective.  makes me realize my luck.  gives me the chance to see what it might be like to be marginalized.  i need that.  i need to know that.  to be fair.  to have a fair view of everything.  to know what kind of world i live in.  problem:  one presenter, a self-proclaimed radical feminist, on stage, before the main act, spouting off about vaginas and their power.  spouting off about being a lesbian feminist.  fine.  but also, inflammatory, angry, projecting a certain, well, hatred for males, specifically white males.  was i scared?  no.  was i shocked?  not really.  things i have read or heard before really.  then why my negative reaction to it?  well.  first, i share  urlLink her  response to it.  click  urlLink here  to read  urlLink her  assessment.  but, secondly, something more frightening.  problem with this sort of display is not necessarily the anger.  anger is good.  problem is not necessarily the fervor.  fervor is good.  problem is the inflammatory language.  it is empty.  it does not have anything to justify itself.  is a build up of words without, well, argument.  it is without well-posited, discipline, careful construction.  what she presented were words, words designed not to reason, not to construct logic, but designed, instead, to enrage, anger, incite a kind of violence, if in thought only.  what one can deduce from it is that the movement, if we can call it that, has taken upon itself the ideal that to fight the imbalance in society, one must inflame to the point of hatred.  this movement suggests that the way to defeat what it finds wrong, it must adopt the inflammatory ideal of reverse bigotry.  that to fight bigotry, one must be a bigot.  there is a logical problem with that, clearly.  probably what troubles me most about those kinds of things.  i admire those who fight for social justice.  for equality.  i do not admire bigots.  whether white or black.  male or female.  gay or straight.  bigots misrepresent, and do an injustice to, the causes for which they try to fight.  they damage causes.  they do not help them.  what's more, there is no arguing or debating with such people.  they worship their words so assuredly that, despite your pleadings, they will not deviate from their hard, coarse line of thought.  their empty words.  same with the fundamentalist religious as well.  they cannot be wrong if everyone else is wrong...so they think.  ignore them and they scream louder.  if they scream louder, ignore them even more.  they cannot thrive being ignored.  so i ignore them.

        so i watch this girl.  i mean, i really watch her.  the way she moves.  how her eyes blink.  the way her cheeks crease when she smiles.  and i know she knows i watch her.  i can see her, sometimes, looking out of the corner of her eye, catching my glance in her sight.  i think about her in the summertime.  how her skin is dark, smooth, and  open to the caresses of the warm sunshiny air.  i think about her in the wintertime, bundled up in her orange jacket, looking like someone out of an old technicolor movie.  i can smell her sweetness when she isn't even around.  look, i'm obviously bowled over by this one.  really.  and you know what?  i don't even care if i admit it.

        religion seems to be following me around lately.  several nights ago, while lying in the darkness, she said to me that deathbed conversions to christianity is cheating.  last night a film in which the main character made a religious conversion.  this morning i was emailed  urlLink this website , a protestant fundamentalist religious group's effort to spread their word.  i keep my religious beliefs to myself.  i hold them dearly, but i do not like to share too much with others.  and i have a reason for this.  you see, religion is a funny thing when it comes to how people deal with it.  in reality, religion is a simple thing, regardless of persuasion.  it is a series of doctrines that structure a belief system that, most often, concerns itself with the spiritual.  i think that most would agree with this rather loose and poorly articulated definition.  something happens, though, when most people deal with religion, and this is something that both drives me crazy and, in my mind, is the fundamental flaw with most people's belief systems.  there is an inkling in people, once they have admitted they have found or are finding their religion, to close of all other forms of dialogue, to seal themselves up, as it were, and then to become proselytizing pillars who spout off what they think others should be believing for their own good.  these approaches to religion are troublesome for a variety of reasons, but i find them most troubling because there is a habit for those to argue about their religion to say "i am right, regardless of what you say," which is, in effect, a closed door to serious, intellectual and spiritual conversation.  a closed door that really reveals a closed mind.  take, for example, some protestant fundamentalist religions absolutely refuse to believe in evolution and many scientific discoveries, they refuse to believe that the roman catholic church is truly a christian church, and they fail to accept their islamic brethren as worshippers of the same god of abraham.    now, they may believe whatever they want.  they have the right to believe what they want, and i promote their liberties in that regard.  but, what is dangerous about their beliefs systems, and i believe this utterly and truly, is that they fail to conceive of the possibility that they are wrong.  that is, that they are fallible human beings who may be mistaken about their belief systems.  they do NOT follow the teachings of jesus of nazareth that suggest that god is the judge of the right and the wrong, the good and the bad, and not mankind.  their logic states that their form of christian religion is right and all else is wrong, and whatever their religion decides is right will be saved and rewarded with the blessings of heaven.  they do not consider, and they should, that it is god who is the judge of these things and not some specific organization of believers.  they, in effect, take on god's job, in doing so, become the self-proclaimed judges of mankind, and create, as it were, their own system of judging who is right an who is wrong.  they do not do as jesus asked them.  jesus asked his followers to spread the word, not to judge.  it is like the men with the stones, ready to stone the sinner:  "Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say about her?" This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her." And once more he bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. But when they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the eldest, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. Jesus looked up and said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and do not sin again."  i do not promote any religion here (though clearly my slant is christian in principle).  and, really, i do not dismiss any religion either.  i suppose i simply want to point out what i see wrong with ANY religion that seeks, as part of its mission, to tell others that they are wrong wrong wrong all of the time, or not living good lives, or not living up to the expectations of god.  the man from nazareth shows us that such things are not for us to judge.  we are not meant to choose the living from the dead, the saved from the damned, the righteous from the sinners.  we are not the ones to decide who is a better believer, who is a better christian, muslim, or jew.  we are not to decide what anyone is.  that is up to god.  and if you do not believe in god, then it is not up to anyone.  the christian gospel states "But many that are first will be last, and the last first."  So even he who finds himself most righteous in the eyes of god is not destined to be first in the eyes of god.  and, of course, i am opening myself up to attacks here from the devoutly religious, i assume.  be that as it may.  i will consider what you have to say as a possibility.  will you just as soon accept mine as just as likely a possibility?  to be human is to fallible.  will you entertain the notion you might be mistaken?  i will gladly entertain the notion i am.

        this weekend i saw  lost in translation  again.  i think it is a good film, and having  urlLink scarlett johansson  in it isn't too bad either.  (damn, what a foxy, foxy chick she is.  she's cuter than all get out, i tell you.)  anyhow, watching that film again was a really interesting event for me.  of course, as one usually does with a film, i noticed things i hadn't noticed before.  i saw scenes in a different light.  i felt i knew the characters a little bit better.  sure, all those things.  but, what's more, i think i came away from this second viewing with a little bit less of an emotional attachment that i had the first time i saw it.  that is, i think this time the movie moved me less than it did the first time i saw it.  i wondered why this was the case.  certainly the film had not changed at all.  it is still about two interesting people meeting up in tokyo, sharing time and love together in a foreign land.  sure.  this is the story and nothing has changed about that.  still, the movie meant less to me, i mean, it moved me less than it did the first time through, and now thinking about it, i think i might know why.  i think (and, truly, this whole piece is conceived of my opinion) that the movie is the kind of film that makes one FEEL something.  that is, the film is evocative.  it asks our minds and our hearts to set themselves onto a different plane, to feel things they may not have felt before.  the movie is, in a way, a window that lets in fresh air and sunshine on an otherwise snowy soul.  the movie's story is about two people in a foreign land who find one another longing for the same things, in essence.  and, on a first viewing of this film, the viewer, too, is in a foreign land.  the film is territory to which the viewer is alien.  and, in this foreign land, the viewer finds two characters with whom he can share an experience, and the movie itself is a film in which the viewer is actually participating.  the viewer is part of the couple that forms on the screen.  just as the pair are in a foreign land, so is the viewer watching this film.  on a second, third, or any subsequent viewing of this film, the foreignness of the film is lost for the viewer.  what was once strange has become familiar.  one knows the story line, one knows the plot, the themes, the characters, the scenes.  suddenly the viewer is no longer lost in a foreign land, but is actually quite knowledgeable of the map of the film.  and that, i think, is what the film depends on.  it depends upon the foreignness of all those involved in the action.  and perhaps, the foreignness of the viewer to the film on an initial viewing gives the viewer a much different and beautiful sense of the film, one that cannot be recaptured after viewing it again and again.  this does not mean, of course, that the film is any less beautiful or less valuable after viewing it the first time.  it just means that this particular film hinges on the importance of unfamiliarity, of the foreign, and its greatest impact can be felt when that film is seen for the first time, the first unfamiliar, foreign time one watches it.

        there are a lot of things i wish i could do.  i wish i could fly, for example.  i wish i could leave my job and not have to worry about paying of debt left over from my marriage.  i wish i could go buy a nice volkswagen.  i wish i could stop everyone from what they were doing.  i wish i could change the course of the world at the present.  i wish i could write a book.  i wish i could play the guitar.  i wish i could play the piano.  i wish i could sing.  i wish i could pay off my bills.  i wish i could travel.  i spend a lot of time wishing, really.  not the usual pining for something that will never come.  i mean, i do not sit around and bemoan my existence and wish it was something much better.  no.  i wish for things that i know probably won't come true, but these are the kind of wishes one can HOPE for, the kinds of wishes that give one hope.  i mean, i COULD learn to play the guitar if i only had the patience and dedication to do something like that.  i COULD pay off my bills, and eventually i WILL pay off my bills, but these things take time.  so, really, what i do by wishing isn't something harmful at all.  it's just something to take my mind away from the uselessness i feel when i am at work.  something to take my mind off the fact that right now i am sitting at work doing something i don't care about for people i don't care about, making books i don't care about for a topic i don't care about.  and that is what everything boils down to anyways.  care.  i mean, if i actually had a reason to CARE about what i did, i could be fantastic.  i could work circles around anyone, any day, any circumstance.  but, as it is, the way the corporate machine works, there is no reason given to care about anything.  no reason at all.  the only reason to care about one's work, really, is the reality that by not caring one can find oneself without a job.  and those kinds of scare tactics do not work on me.  i am immune to those silly tactics in every way shape and form.  i mean, i care so little, really, that it makes no sense, even, to say any disparaging remarks about anything i do, because i don't even care enough to waste my time on that.  really what i want is a bottle of wine right now.  perhaps a nice cab...merlot would be too dry for right now.  it'd be nice, yes, to have some wine, sit back and watch tv.  maybe rent a movie.  and, by god, it is the middle of the afternoon and i am wishing for this.  i really just want to relax already.  to have nothing at all to do, not be constrained to any work environment that requires me to sit at a desk.  so, yes, a bottle of wine and some television sound very good right now.  but i am trapped behind a desk.  a desk, mind you, that i do not care about, so i find myself wishing for things like the power of flight (which in itself is not realistic, i know, but i can wish to fly in order to free myself from my bondage to all these moral things, so you see, even though flying is impossible, it serves me a spiritual purpose to wish for it).  sigh.  and someone really damn nice (and lovely, and all those damn things) sent me a cd in the mail yesterday.  the girl who sings on this cd has the sweetest voice i have heard in awhile, so i really enjoy it.  anyways, so i listen to this cd here at my desk, my headphones on, and people still keep bothering me to tell me what they are going to be doing, despite the fact that it does not matter to me what they do with their own work because, really, it does not impact me, and i do not care anyways, and i am wishing i could fly in the meantime.  this can really get depressing, you know.  i have no wine, no tv (though i DO have cds, which is some consolation), and i am tied, in essence, to my desk, listening to other people tell me what they are going to be doing that in no way impacts me at all.  and besides, there is a woman here who has a really loud voice and all she does all day is talk very, very loud, and it is quite bothersome.  she should really learn to shut up because one day, really i mean this, one day i am going to have to ask her to be quiet already because she interrupts the pleasant sound of the sweet voice of the girl on my cd that someone so kindly sent me in the mail as a gift.  enough of all this already, is basically what i am saying.  i just want to go home and pet my cat.  my cat.  i have a picture of my cat at my desk.  not so much to say to other people, "oh look at my cute cat, i am the proud owner of...," but moreso to remind myself that at home i could sit around with the soft little furball and be totally at peace with everything around me.  and i think this is what i end up wishing for the most, really, some wine, tv, and to sit around with my cat and have no obligation to do anything at all, even if it means wasting the day to drinking and television watching.  i mean, that would be nice, you know, really damn nice.

          things that currently frighten me about this country   we are fighting two simultaneous wars, both of which have no end in sight.  there is an increasing sentiment for the need to censor.  privacy has ceased to be a right and has become instead a privilege.  greed, in all its hues, has become something to be admired.  the one who has more, owns more, is more powerful, "has the best toys" is the one people admire the most.  discrimination is being tolerated, and people are accepting the "masked" discriminatory remarks made by others.  we have a president that insists that calls the wills of judges "arbitrary," but who himself desires to press his arbitrary will into the lives of every man, woman, and child in this country.  the right to dissent has become unpatriotic.  healthcare and education, two fundamentally necessary needs for survival in this society, are afforded little of the government's vast wealth, thus rendering both under-funded.  only those who can afford the best of both are able to "survive."  also, healthcare is something that is FOR-profit.  a sickening and unfortunate fact that enables only the well-to-do to receive adequate treatment.  this suggests that our society only values the wealthy and would rather leave the poor to suffer.

        this morning it was a different song in the shower.   it's the end of the world as we know it , to which i didn't know any words except,  it's the end of the world as we know it .  so i sang that, over and over, until i got irritated with myself and stopped.  i have lived alone now for a little over six months, and truth be told, i am starting to get lonely.  here where i work there is a great variety of kiss-asses.  i probably shouldn't call them that because the fact of the matter is that their enthusiasm about work (whether artificial or not) is probably getting them much, much more than i am getting being dejected and bitter.  at any rate, i am tired of hearing what is obviously feigned enthusiasm about the world of legal publishing and, in particular, online legal publishing.  i am tired of things always being "online."  we say "oh, i can check that online," or "let me look that up online."  online this, online that.  i am tired of onlineness...and i know i am being hypocritical, too, because this little journal is online, but whatever.  i don't have to like the instruments of the empire in order to use them.  i just saw someone at his desk with his head in his hands.  i thought to myself, "what can be wrong in his world?"  and i meant it sincerely.  but still i kept walking to the coffee machine instead of bothering to ask.  doing that is like cutting someone off on the freeway, a total lack of consideration.  i wimped out last night and only drank half of a bottle of wine.  the whole bottle wanted to be consumed, but i managed only half.  so much for an overdose.

        it is, i think, because the notion of feeling one's way forward, of groping in the darkness or semi-darkness, implies a testing of the way with the whole body.  and although this method may be painfully slow, it is much less likely to lead me astray that if i relied on sight alone and had an open country to cross and a bright sun to go by.  in this way i will experience every inch of the way rather than suddenly finding that i have reached my goal with very little sense of the terrain i have passed through.  if i can simply walk across the space that lies between me and my goal i may arrive there quickly, but then i will be left wondering whether i have really arrived or only dreamed or imagined it.  gabriel josipovici,  touch

        it's really mostly a feeling of discomfort.  for example, my clothes do not fit me like they used to.  i used to weigh much less, and now they are tighter than i remember, and my shirts sort of cling to my arms in a way i am not used to.  more than that, it is the world around me that doesn't seem to fit just right anymore.  there is a certain tightness about it, really, a kind of shrinking it has done (or a growing i have done) that makes it fit just a little bit not-rightly.  whatever it is, things aren't the way they have been, or, better said, things are not the way they should be, and they haven't been for a little while now.  for example, arguments.  i haven't had an argument during which i had forgotten what i was arguing about, really, in a long time...that is, until just recently.  these kinds of things can throw you through a loop in a way that you aren't really fond of being thrown through a loop, and the end result is that you end up looking at the world as though it is looking at you funny.  it is as though the world has a sour face made at you, and all you want to do is punch it, but you can't because it's far too big to punch and punching it wouldn't do much good anyways because it is bigger and stronger than you and could kick your ass any day of the week.  and there is more to this, really, than can be said in such a small space (i am limiting my self out of necessity, because if i do not limit myself i will end up typing something that i don't really feel like reading anyways, and that will, no doubt, end up coming out in a way i do not want it to come out, naturally).  my hair is messy, and even though it is short and can't really look too messy, it is messy and that can be a source of stress... and my jaw is cracking every time i open my mouth, which is actually more a cause of pain than anything else.  all these things add up, and you just want to say to the world, "please stop this because i am not enjoying it anymore and i would like a better day and i would like to have sex with a girl and make pretty love noises as bluebirds fly over head, the way disney would have drawn it had he drawn softcore porn."

        "...she no longer believes very strongly in belief.  Things can be true, she now thinks, even if one does not believe them, and conversely.  Belief may be no more, in the end, than a source of energy, like a battery which one clips into an idea to make it run.  As happens when one writes: believing whatever has to be believed in order to get the job done."  -J.M. Coetzee,  Elizabeth Costello

        waiting in line for a concert this weekend, i saw an advertisement for the stills' "logic will break your heart."  i've never heard the stills, though i know some people who have and say they are a good band, so i do not know what about their songs might have made them name their cd with this title, but nonetheless this title struck me as rather brilliant.  i am skeptical when people use the term "logical" or "reasonable."  i find these ideas rather difficult to swallow.  people say, particularly supposed authorities on things and politicians, that we should do things "logically" or act "reasonably," but i truly wonder what this even means anymore.  logic, it seems to me, is simply a cold, hard way of dealing with things that doesn't take into consideration a great deal of other factors--particularly feeling and emotion.  logic, in its purest state, is devoid of emotion.  it is not subjective, but objective.  it is an overriding system of what is right and wrong, true and false, black and white.  logic, as it is employed classically, is a rigorous system that seeks to approve (or prove) something through a series of rational steps that, quite mathematically, asserts the trueness or falseness of something.  it seeks to verify through precision, like science, without influence from emotion or feeling.  reason, rationality, and logic, in their purest forms are cold.  they do not cater to feeling, they do not lend themselves to consideration of humanity and passion.  they are, in a sense, dead concepts, removed from the fullness of living because they do not take into account all that it means to live.  to live, it seems, means to act not only through thinking but also through feeling...and this is something that logic, reason, rationality cannot compute.  but, what's more, to use a term from logic, i wonder how valid logic, reason, and rationality are anyways.  to borrow from coetzee's elizabeth costello, "reason looks to me suspiciously like the being of human thought; worse than that, like the being of one tendency in human thought.  reason is the being of a certain spectrum of human thought."  and if this one tendency in human thought is indeed so cold and calculating, then what do we do about the fact that we feel, have sympathy, and even cry?  what is forgotten most often is that we feel.  we are beings that have the capability to think rationally, to calculate in that cold, hard way, but we are also beings who are stirred emotionally by things that bring us to our knees in tears or to our tip-toes in joy.  we are beings that, although we can use logic to solve problems, also have tangled into those problems heaps of emotions that are invested in such a way that even logic cannot calculate.  and it is those who depend solely on what seems logical are the cruelest, coldest people.  these are the people that do not fathom emotion, that do not add to their equations the unknowable variables of human emotion.  this is why warmongers, who envision a world that acts by their vision of reason. do not take into consideration to true feeling of a child dying with shrapnel wounds.  these are the people who do not feel the plight of the innocent, whose blood is shed in the name of what is reasonable and logical for humanity.  these people are cruel because they do not calculate the human toll that coincides with their logistical plans.  they are, indeed, heartless, and instead act calculatingly and are, indeed, blind to the true horrors of conflict, its human tolls.  back to the stills: "logic will break your heart."  this is an apt title.  logic will break your heart because it must break your heart.  logic does not know the bounds of human emotion, it is devoid of it.  what is purely logical is always cold and cruel.  it has to be.  it cannot, in its system, deal with the calculations of the heart.  these difficult emotive forces are too much for its rigorous system of proofs.  a logical system cannot hold this weight, the weight of the heart.  then do we do away with logic?  no.  we cannot.  as costello says, it is one part of human thought.  indeed, we need it...we must even depend upon it.  but we should realize, though, that logic and reason and rationality are not enough.  it is not enough for something to be logical.  we have to remember to feel, to let our hearts wrap themselves around everything we do.  to let both our minds and our hearts be part of our decisions.  to be purely logical is to be without feeling, and to be without feeling is to be inhuman(e).

        woke up this morning tired.  she was in the other room with my cat...was probably my snoring.  i was on the couch under a large comforter.  i rolled off the couch.  about a half hour earlier she came to tell me my alarm went off.  i barely remembered it.  showered singing:   once i lived the life of a millionaire, spent all my money, didn't have any cares, took all my friends out for a mighty good time, bought bootleg liquor, champagne and wine, then i began to fall so low, lost all my good friends, had nowhere to go, if i get my hands on a dollar again, i'll hang on to it, til that old eagle grins, because, nobody knows you when your down and out, in your pocket not one penny, and as for friends you don't have any...   the shower was warm, but uncomfortable.  the cat peeked her head in a couple of times, her whiskers making noise against the shower curtain.  got dressed in the hallway, same old clothes.  spilled my medicine on the floor, fought the cat trying to get all the pills off of the carpet.  kissed her goodbye, left to my car.  outside they were working on the parking lot.  resurfacing, so it was noisy and smelly.  large machines brushing the bare concrete, prepping it for a layer of asphalt.  driving to work was ordinary.  or...i take that back.  driving today was not so ordinary.  i was kinder today, letting people pass in front of me.  didn't care about slowdowns.  didn't care about being cut off.  this is extraordinary for me, really.  usually i am angry.  once i got to work my mood changed.  became a bit grumpy.  perhaps it's just the atmosphere., being in an office on friday, having to work when there are other things i would like to be doing.  and, really, people here are a bit strange to me.  they are nice and all, sure, but they are strange...and often not too bright.  that is a problem, too.  for several days now i have had nothing to say.  no little tid bits.  no little lessons or observations.  it's amazing, really, how little actually goes on in this world.  i mean, in small ways.  sure there is war.  two of them.  people dying.  that kind of thing.  sure there are other major, happier things.  basketball playoffs, for example.  but, really, on smaller scales, things don't really happen.  i'm going to a concert tonight, but there is nothing profound in that, really.  well, perhaps.  perhaps there is something profound in that, only i am not seeing it.  i shouldn't discount these things.  i shouldn't discount what looks to be ordinary.  perhaps, today, that will be my message.  not to take the ordinary for granted.  it can be boring, sure.  it can be redundant, of course.  it can be...yes, it can even be downright sufferable.  but, at the same time, there could be something there that you are missing.  there could be little speckles of something worth remembering, thinking about, hell, even treasuring.  i guess the more ordinary things seem, the more fascinating they can be.  maybe that is what ordinary things tell us: do not take them for granted.

         i.   last night i was at the bar with whom i consider a good friend.  we shared quite a bit: stories; beers; jokes; and ideas.  i was smoking a cigarette, though i didn't really want one, when he began talking of credit cards, and we shared our woes of debt with one another.  we talked about women, the ones we loved, the ones we didn't love anymore.  he talked about his family, the pride he has in his son, the wonder he has for his daughter.  i spoke of the class that i teach, sharing with him the troubles of my lessons, the troubles that the students present.  we shared, too, the many trials that our jobs present us, the trouble we find within the walls of our respective institutions.  we shared a lot, and we often agreed that things sometimes seem harder than they need to be, and we laughed at what we see as terrible ironies about our very existence.  this sharing showed me something very important.  it reminded me that i am not alone, that other share troubles with me (whether larger or smaller the troubles it does not matter).  it reminded me that no matter what, there are others around who understand what i am going through because they have gone through the same or worse themselves.  these kinds of moments, these unexpected revelations, often appear in writing as "hallmark card" moments--moments that cause one to say "aw" and make one feel superficially good about the world.  but, truth be told, for me this is a big revelation.  it shows me that this world has much more madness in it that i think i have in my own life; and what's more, that what i see as madness isn't really madness at all, but the regular, every day trials that accompany living itself.    ii.   last night i went home and cried, but the tears were different this time.  instead of crying because i felt loss or hopelessness, i cried because, of all things, i simply felt love.  that all that matters in this world is that you get the chance to love people.  and i cried hard and long this time.

        my kitten woke me up this morning.  she was purring, brushing her whiskers up against my cheek.  the air was cold as it came through my open window.  i should have closed the window last night, but didn't.  i finished reading robinson crusoe last night and began a new book, elizabeth costello.  i have been doing a lot of reading lately, much more than usual.  i have felt a need to read, a need that i really never noticed before.  essentially, everything is normal.  things haven't changed too much.  i haven't changed to much.  each day is roughly the same, with the same mild challenges, with the same daily trials.  there is something comforting in this regularity, this daily routine, these days of sameness.  each day can be expected to be no more shocking, and no more boring, than the one before, and there is something nice about that, something that says to us "yes, everything will be just as it should be," each day, every day.

        So little do we see before us in the World, and so much reason have we to depend chearfully upon the great Maker of the World, that he does not leave his Creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in the worst Circumstances they have always something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their Deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their Deliverance by the Means by which they seem to be brought to their Destruction. ~Daniel Defoe,  Robinson Crusoe

        being male, i have the unfortunate privilege of using male restrooms.  this is unfortunate, i tell you, for a variety of reasons.  generally these places, these dens of germs and disease, are filthy places, pubic hairs strewn about, urine on the floor, and even, yes, snots on the walls.  these details alone are enough to disgust me and cause me to get in and out of these places as quickly as i can.  but, i tell you, these things are not the worst of restroom experiences.  one thing drives me crazier, and grosses me out more, than anything else.  i will say it plainly: some people are obnoxious shitters.  you can hear them in their stalls, sitting upon the porcelain pots, giving it all they've got.  usually things start off quiet, the usual calm before the storm. then suddenly, these select individuals, erupt in fountains of farts that, upon echoing in the bowl, fill the room with the illustrious sounds of the human rectum.  these people, these select people, have no loss of pride in erupting in farts, but rather seem to have no qualms at all about stunning their bathroom partners with the sounds of the gut.  but, perhaps, the most irritating noise of all are the ones that follow the farts.  these, i think, are the most obnoxious noises of all.  these men, these grown adults, commence groaning and moaning as they push, with all the strength of their abdomens, the lengths of mushy turds from their asses.  these sounds are, indeed, productions rather than utterances.  these men take pride in their heaving and sighing. as if they are giving birth to the second coming itself, these men groan, moan, push, and shove with all the might of their asses and their vocal chords, letting everyone in the restroom know "this is one mighty shit."  these men, shameless as they are, find no embarrassment in vocalizing the fact that they are, indeed, pooping.  and, they seek to make everyone in earshot know that, yes, shit is coming out of their assholes.  male restrooms disgust me.  but worse than the sights of the restroom, and yes even worse than the smells, are the sounds that a few shameless men take when shoving shit from their asses.  they want to make productions out of pooping, and, quite frankly, these are sounds i do not want to hear.

        this morning when i woke up, the cat wasn't happy.  she was running around the apartment making quite a bit of noise, getting into things she shouldn't have been getting into.  as she clawed my bedcovers, i thought to myself that she needed her nails cut.  so, upon getting out of bed, i picked up the cat and took the nail clippers to her paws.  i trimmed her claws down quite a bit, despite her meows and hisses of protest.  i got into the shower like i do every morning.  usually everything goes well in the shower.  i can wash and get clean, let the stream of water coast down my back, relaxing.  but today that didn't happen.  i turned on the water and there was no hot water at all.  it was, at best, room temperature.  so, i stood there, in chilly water, shampooed my hair, soaped up my chest and armpits, washed down my legs, in a hurry.  i wanted to get out of the shower as soon as possible.  i have a sore throat today and my head hurts.  my eyes have pressure built behind them. i think i am getting sick.  really, this sounds terrible.  my morning sounds like it was a wreck, having to fight a cat to cut her claws, having to take a cold shower, and having a cold that makes my head feel terrible.  but, in truth, these things are just minor irritations that come with being alive in this world.  the truth is that i am a lucky man.  i very lucky man.  i am able to afford, for the most part, living a comfortable lifestyle.  i am not starving; i am not without clothes.  i spend my time with a wonderful, a truly wonderful, woman who loves me and is, for me, the single most precious thing in this world.  i am healthy; i think i may be able to go off my myriad of medications in due course.  i have a job that, for the most part, provides me with decent benefits and pay.  i have a second job that i am able to do for fun, teaching young adults how to write essays that will help them throughout their time at the university.  i have every reason to be happy.  sure times have been tough the past year.  sure i am finishing up a divorce.  sure my family isn't the best in the world (in fact, right now it is in shambles).  sure i could be richer.  sure i could be out of debt.  sure many things could be better than they are.  but they aren't, and i am okay with that.  i could spend my time hating my situation.  i could spend my time sighing away the days, counting the minutes of my misery, but i am not one to do that, to wallow in my particular situation.  certainly i am sad at times, even depressed.  certainly i think and feel much more than many might think and feel about certain things.  i think this is because i am really in touch with myself, what it means to feel, what it means to be human.  but, even though i can feel this way, i don't let it rule me the way it could...the way it really, really could.  reading these postings you might get the idea that i am constantly wallowing in self-pity, but that isn't the case.  that isn't the case at all.  i am happy.  i am a happy man, despite what many may think.  things are, for once, really going my way.

        the edges of things are very precious, very delicate areas.  we like to decorate edges of pictures by putting frames around them.  we like to protect the edges of things as well.  sometimes we put little plastic stripes on corners of walls to protect them from chipping; sometimes we put cloths on our tables to protect its edges from gouging.  we trim things in lace, decorating the edges of dresses, clothes, and fabrics.  we gild the edges of fine books in 14k gold.  we cherish edges, and we take them for granted at the same time.  what of this talk of edges, though?  why this talk?  i am thinking in particular of something we do not commonly think of when we think of edges.  i am thinking of the edges of our memories, those faint flickers in our minds of things that no longer exist, of times that no longer happen.  we remember the edges of things.  the outside lines of things and the rest we fill with blurry details, as we do in coloring books, filling in the centers of outlines drawings.  i remember climbing the pyramid at  urlLink chitzen itza , climbing to the top and leaving her behind at the bottom.  i remember it being very hot in the jungle.  i remember her being very afraid to climb, wanting to rest in the shade.  i remember asking a french couple to snap my photograph at the top.  i remember later going to a small hotel nearby, having a small lunch, looking at small items in the gift shop, i remember being too hot, too sweaty, too thirsty.  but, see, these details are only the edges of the events.  these are only the outer surfaces of something much deeper, and much more real, that is lost to time.  the events are gone and all i have left are the outlines, the sketchy details of what once was, the little pieces of sight, smell, taste, and touch that linger in the mind like fragments of a puzzle we had once seen completely finished but that is now apart. we can't fill out these memories and make them real again.  we can't put back the love or the thoughts or the ideas we had just then and make these spaces in the mind come to be again.  we cannot relive them.  so all we have are these edges, these surface pieces of what once was.  these edges are the most precious, the ones we hold dearest to our hearts, these edges of memory, of time and place, of what once was when our hearts were in different places.  and these edges are the ones we decorate and protect the most.

        i didn't want to wake up this morning.  things have been eerily unsettling lately, as if the rug i am standing on is slowly but surely being pulled from underneath my feet.  i don't feel comfortable with anything, and today is one of the days that i feel like my world is turning itself upside down...of its own volition, too.  i sign the papers today.  i sign the agreement and articles of dissolution that me and my soon-to-be ex-wife have agreed to as a result of our no being able to coexist, and subsequently, our falling out of love.  it is a sad day.  a sad and, really, monumental day.  today i take a step in brushing off an old life with all of it baggage and accepting a newer, free life.  but there are other things, too.  for example, my shirt just doesn't fit right today.  it is a shirt i wear over and over, and one that i have never had any real discomfort wearing, but today is different.  it feels tighter, smaller, the sleeves feel shorter, and the neck feels like it is choking me.  i'm uncomfortable in it.  i keep scratching my neck, nervously.  my skin is raw and pink.  my hands are dry and itchy, too.  things don't feel quite so right in my world today.  the vending machine gave me a pepsi-cola instead of a coca-cola.  it was out of coca-cola, and that is my favorite.  my salad for lunch was utterly unsatisfying, and the lady two desks away had chinese food that smelled better than anything i had ever smelled before, and i bet she enjoyed it.  i got a phone call last night, around 12:30.  it was my mother in a fury.  upset that my sister is not living her life the way my mother had hoped she would.  i did not entertain her objections and suggested she leave my sister alone for once.  i said i didn't want to be involved.  my mother said, "fine, fine" and hung up on me.  i can't make anyone happy.  so an hour from now i go to sign the documents, and really it bums me out.  things are never supposed to turn out this way, with sad and unfortunate endings.  everything is always supposed to turn out the way it does in happy storybooks, rose petals falling from a sunshiney sky, the dew wet on the grass, everyone in smiles.  that is the way things are supposed to turn out, at least that is what we are told.  but nothing we plan ever really works the way we'd like it.  some days the world is just off a little bit, slightly bent out of alignment, the edges not meeting up nicely.  tomorrow could be better or worse, but regardless it will come.  and tomorrow the sun will shine somewhere and someone will die and someone will be born.  someone will cry and someone will laugh.  things will turn out better for some people and worse for others.  but there will be a tomorrow, and what it brings can't be any worse than what it takes away.

        i feel as though lost on on empty island.  "Upon the whole, here was an undoubted Testimony, that there was scarce any Condition in the World so miserable, but there was something Negative or something Positive to be thankful for in it; and let this stand as a Direction from the Experience of the most miserable of all Conditions in this World, that we may always find in it something to comfort our selves from, and to set in the Description of Good and Evil, on the Credit Side of the Accompt."

       friday:    a fine "let's do  urlLink nothing  night" starring me and my cat.  quite literally did  urlLink nothing  all night, sans for filing away some bills and tidying up the apartment   saturday:    took the  urlLink gre  subject test in english literature.  was very difficult, as these tests go.  i know that i answered at the very least three questions correctly.  i am banking on these three questions being worth a majority of the score of the test, though i highly doubt that is the case.  tried to go to the  urlLink "super-mega-meltdown-liquidator-super-show-buying-place"  with the girl, but upon finding you had to pay admission to get in, turned promptly around and went to  urlLink gabriel bros.  instead.  i bought a toothbrush holder, a t-shirt, and some  urlLink pretzels .  went to see  urlLink  the ladykillers  , starring  urlLink tom hanks , with the girl.  was an okay movie, though the commercials and previews make the movie look funnier than it actually is.  in fact, this movie may even be a bit over-rated, perhaps simply because it is a  urlLink coen   urlLink bros.  movie.  i also thought that the way the movie ended was an easy way out for the bros., insofar as the ending allowed for a nice, tidy clean-up of the entire film instead of having to explain what would happen next and so forth.   sunday:    went to  urlLink palm sunday  services with my family and one  urlLink hungarian  soccer player.  my parents argued before and during  urlLink church  about the condition of my father's  urlLink pants  (my mother insisted they were wrinkled, my father objected).  the  urlLink hungarian  soccer player came with my sister.  i was told his name, but i forgot it promptly.  he waved to me from down the pew.  by his wave i thought him a nice person, though i didn't have chance to talk with him.  came home and took the medicines i forgot to take the night before.  this promptly knocked me out for most of the day.  i awoke at 9:00 pm, noticing my apartment was very dark and the tv was on.  i made some terkiyaki noodle thing from  urlLink lipton  or something like that for dinner.  was pretty good, though i did burn my tongue on it.  i read a bit from a  urlLink book  and then fell back asleep.

        i enjoy drinking belgian-style ales.  they are rich beers that are generally smooth and satisfying.  here are three of my favorites:   urlLink chimay  ale (premiere [red], cinq cents [white], grande reserve [blue]:  chimay is the mercedes-benz of belgian ales.  brewed at the abbey of notre-dame de scourmont since 1862, chimay ales are the finest example of belgian ale.  an authentic trappist beer, chimay ale's cost per bottle lives up to the pleasure it gives.  a 25.4 fl.oz. bottle will run the average consumer anywhere from $8 to $12.  allow the beer to age to fourteen months before you drink it, and you will find chimay to be one of the silkiest beers you will ever have the opportunity to taste.   urlLink corsendonk trappist ale :  corsendonk is the cousin of chimay.  it shares chimay's fruity flavor and bitterness, but doesn't compare to chimay's silky slide over the tongue.  still, for only $7 a bottle, corsendonk is cheaper than its cousin chimay, and if allowed to age, can replicate, roughly, the fineness of chimay for those on a budget.   urlLink blanche de chambly : from quebec, unibroue's blanche de chambly is perhaps the bargain of bargains when it comes to belgian-style ales.  at around $6-$7 dollars a bottle, this smooth, lightly hopped, slightly fruity, white ale has a fine aroma and taste.  though, like corsendonk, it is not a replacement for chimay, for those who have a few less dollars to spend on ale, blanche de chambly is a fine, fine choice, deserving of consideration when looking for a good beer.

         dreams   i have been having bad dreams lately.  each dream is a representation of the past, but with a particular variation: they are dreams of the past and things i should have done in the past.  i don't really want to repeat what these dreams are.  i mean, to do so would reopen these sore spots, and to make me think about them even more than i do would be a painful punishment.  let's just say, these dreams disturb me and i am left each day with a certain uneasy feeling that does not go away easily.  i feel as though, perhaps, i owe a debt to certain people, and my mind, in my sleep, is reminding me of these debts.  and, in the act of reminding me of what i owe them, makes the pain that they must feel resonate throughout MY being.  needless to say, this is tiring, disturbing, and, to say the very least, upsetting.  i want to make everything better.  i wish i could.    fast facts about me: the week of may 24-28, 2004:   four tattoos; went off my major antidepressent this week, i spent one full day being nothing but dizzy in withdrawl; coca-cola is my favorite soft drink;  urlLink http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/index415.html ; "the universe is shaped exactly like the earth/if you go straight long enough you end up where you were; i have been officially divorced for two weeks (5/28); i try to stick to decaffeinated coffee; the car is scratched and has a rust spot; the money will be coming soon; "these pretzels are making me thirsty"; one confederate dollar (north carolina); night baseball; can you smell the rain?  it smells nice; how many three-day weekends in a row?; the tightest hug i ever felt.

        the windy city is not as windy as you'd expect it to be.  in the morning it was cooler.  in the mid-60s, so i decided that i would wear blue jeans.  she asked me, multiply, whether or not i wanted to change into shorts before we left.  "no, i'll be fine.  it looks like rain anyways, and if it rains it will cool off and i will want pants anyways."  "you're sure!?"  "yeah."  the temperature climbed.  we took the train to the art museum, but the train let out a few blocks away.  we had to walk.  it was humid, my legs were sweaty.  i grinned, said i should have worn shorts.  she smiled back, told me not to say a word.  we made it to the art museum and i was sweating like a pig.  where is the goddam wind in this city? i was thinking.  we were by the lake, and usually wind by the lake is cooler, relieving.  by the time we reached the art museum the air had grown stale and i was sweltering.  the art museum was temperature-controlled.  not for my sake, i am sure, but for the art's sake.  600 year old paintings do not do well in the humidity of midwestern america.  we looked at art, and my jeans hung on me, drying out in the moisture-less air of the museum.  my sweat dissipating.  we spent hours at the museum, leaving tired and dazed from seeing so much paint on so many pieces of wood and canvas.  outside the air was still warm, muggy.  we sat on the steps of the museum, decided what to do next.  "well, we definitely want to go to gino's, right?"  "yeah, if you want."  we are both indecisive.  "well, what should we do?"  "i dunno.  what do you want to do?"  "let's go see the fountain."  "ok."  we walked again, in the sun.  again my jeans over-heated me.  i was dying, the sun beating down, the humidity suffocating my flesh.  i should have worn shorts, i thought.  i saw a homeless man sleeping on the grass.  he was covered with a jacket, he wore long pants, too.  i couldn't understand it.  how did he stay cool?  or didn't that matter to him anymore?  what does comfort matter when you have to sleep in a mud puddle on the front lawn of the museum?  we walked and i complained, "i should have worn shorts."  we crossed the couple of streets, walked over the footbridge.  we were at the fountain.  it was still warm and i watched the water dance over the sides of the stone creation.  "dammit, to soak my hot legs in that water," i thought.  my forehead was dripping.  i was squinting in the sunlight.  i suggested, "we need to find someone to take our picture."  we did.  three girls taking pictures of one another in front of the same fountain.  if they took ours, they said, we had to take one of them.  fair enough.  the taller one took my camera.  stood back.  asked if we were ready.  i smiled awkwardly.  she tugged me close to her side.  the camera snapped.  as we walked away from the fountain, the wind started to blow.  it was cool, finally.

        evidently i have a fake smile.  that is, i have one of those smiles people make when they are getting pictures taken and they are forced to smile, so the smiles come across looking like cardboard-fake-i-am-smiling-but-really-my-mouth-is-just-open smiles.  i think i smiled that way in our picture by the fountain.  dammit.

        i felt bad wasting the hash browns.  we went to filter over the weekend.  in chicago.  it's an urban coffee shop with retro-looking chairs, hip young servers, and art on the walls.  a nice place.  we ordered breakfast.  she got an omelet and some hobo hash (they called it).  i ordered pancakes and hashbrowns.  when the food came out i was no-joke shocked at the size of the portions.  two pancakes, each the size of my head, easy.  a plate of hashbrowns that rivaled the amount of pancakes on the other plate.  certainly a large meal for 6 bucks.  big enough...no, too big, even...for me to eat.  too much food, and i couldn't finish it all.  and everywhere we went i noticed people on the street, living there among the tossed-away newspapers and empty beer bottles.  nestled into the corners of the doorways of abandoned buildings, wrapped in whatever they could carry, looking for spare change from whoever took a second to empty a pocket.  and me.  i threw away half a plate of hashbrowns.  perfectly good hashbrowns because i was too full to eat them.  i was able to eat my fill, and throw away the rest.  i can afford to.

        i checked my email today.  four or five ads for hot teens ready to show me their breasts.  two ads for enlarging my dick.  one ad for getting valium online.  another three ads promising me low mortgage rates.  i have 115 dollars in my wallet, but that won't last.  money seems flow straight away from me lately.  it's a problem, really, i can't hold on to one cent it seems.  yesterday, in front of my apartment complex, there were three college guys playing wiffle ball.  i parked my car away from them so that they wouldn't accidentally smash their ball into my car.  i opened my trunk, took out the groceries and kitty litter, and then stood there and watched them from a distance.  i didn't stand long, i didn't have the patience, but it was nice to see people playing on the lawn, laughing and having fun.  pumping gas this morning, not even 15 dollars worth of the cheap stuff will fill my tank all the way.  i guess i should have spent five dollars more and filled the tank.  the price of these things has gone up dramatically; everyone knows this.  but you don't hear or see anyone who has any sort of power doing anything about it.  it's the way things go, i suppose.  i've been staring at the same computer screen for three straight days.  i have my workstation open, the programs i am supposed to use to work are ready to go, but the truth is that i have nothing to work on.  it's this same way every day, it seems.  nothing to do.  everything here is about waiting...waiting to get your edited proofs back.  waiting to have someone respond to your email.  waiting for the deadline to come and pass before you can do anything because you are waiting for someone else to do her part of the job.  this is the way work works around here, and though i am used to it, i do not like it anymore and it is time to find something else already.  but there is nothing else, it seems, nowhere, for no one.  it is the state of the economy, they say.  perhaps it is.  i think that reading  the satanic verses  has been giving me weird dreams:  last night, in my sleep, i am in love with a girl.  she has long dark hair and her skin is fair.  she lives on the north side of the city, in a small, wooded neighborhood and the top of a small hill.  she already has a boyfriend, but she knows she is in love with me, totally and completely.  her boyfriend is a jerk anyways.  she calls me.  she wants to see me.  things aren't well.  she says she needs to relax, so she wants to see me to relax.  in the dream, i have unlimited resources, so i visit a local fair where, as part of the exhibitions, there is a series of tents dedicated to zen living...small tents, each themed for positive life-energy and relaxation.  they contain fountains, steams, things that bring comfort.  in each tent an asian woman is stretching, yoga style, in a seemingly difficult position, showcasing relaxation, zen-living.  i think to myself, in the dream, that one of these tents is exactly what my dark-haired girl needs to relax.  i approach one of the asian women, i ask her, politely, if i could pack up her tent and fountains and rice-paper screens, take them to my dark-haired girl so that she too can know this relaxation.  the asian girl only nods, and we pack up the text and its contents.  we take them to the dark-haired girl's house and re-compose the scene.  the tent is up, the fountains running, steam pouring out of warm baths, rice-paper screens arranged artistically.  i bend into the pool of water, the fountain fills it.  it is warm.  i know soon that the dark-haired girl will find me there...she will love this, i think.  all for her.

           "'Anyone who says that life matters less to animals than it does to us has not held in his hands an animal fighting for its life. The whole of the being of the animal is thrown into that fight, without reserve. When you say that the fight lacks a dimension of intel- lectual or imaginative horror, I agree. It is not the mode of being of animals to have an intellectual horror: their whole being is in the living flesh.    “If I do not convince you, that is because my words, here, lack the power to bring home to you the wholeness, the unabstracted, unintellectual nature, of that animal being. That is why I urge you to read the poets who return the living, electric being to language; and if the poets do not move you, I urge you to walk, flank to flank, beside the beast that is prodded down the chute to his executioner.'"  -  Elizabeth Costello  (or  The Lives of Animals ), J.M. Coetzee

        sometimes things are just too easy.  not easy like tying your shoes easy.  not easy like tossing a ball into a barrel easy.  i mean, things that seem like they should be more difficult easy.  the courtroom was pretty, carved wood, a ceiling with molded plaster, recesses painted dark green.  there were ten "cases."  what else do you call them when they are in court?  "cases" seems like the right word in this event.  some went up in pairs, husbands and wives soon to be no more.  they ended right there, and all you had to do was answer a couple of questions.  questions that didn't seem to matter really, when you think of it.  do you promise that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you god?  is this your name? is this your address? do you agree with the agreement? do you agree with what she has testified?  our turn was over, it seemed, before it even started.  by the time i had realized that i had just answered questions, the judge signed his name to a piece of paper and that was it.  i was single again, and it was that easy, that simply, a flourish of the pen, the inscribing of a mark, and we were through.  and it was all remarkably easy.  too easy, really, when you think about it.  it was as though there was nothing there to be done at all but to make sure we were right about who we are and where we live, and on those facts alone, we were sure enough about where we were in our lives, sure enough to say that when we left the courthouse we would take different cars, go in different directions, ride toward separate horizons.

        i'm tired people.  i'm tired of what this world has come to.  all over the news now is the story of a fellow, a private contractor, in iraq who was captured by insurgents and, on video tape, was beheaded with a knife in what the captors called retaliation for the abuses of iraqi prisoners by american forces.  i think all of us are horrified at the thought of what that poor man went through...being pushed to the ground, his hands and feet bound tightly, his hair pulled, his throat exposed, the sharp blade of a knife slicing through skin and muscle, tendon and vessel, his shrill painful screams turning to a stomach-turning silence.  this, indeed, is a horrible thought.  this, indeed is a horrible cruelty.  and the prisoner abuse is no less sickening.  smug american soldiers gawking at the penises of undressed iraqi prisoners with bags on their heads, a female soldier arrogantly giving a thumbs up to the exposed genitals of a prisoner.  the same woman, sickeningly pulling a leash that is attached to a naked prisoner's neck as he lies on the floor in the fetal position.  this is america's finest and bravest at work.  (and even more sickeningly is the fact that we have made excuses for these soldiers, saying that they were "undertrained," "unsupervised," or "too young."  these excuses are as sickening as the acts, serving to justify gross and improper acts by padding them with poor reasons why such "brave and honorable" people would act in such a disappointing manner.)  our president sits in the white house, unable to come up with answers to reporters questions, unable to say he has made any mistakes, unwilling, even, to consider the fact that he might have made a bad choice.  the point of the war has changed time and time again, but no one notices: first it was to find weapons of mass destruction, then it was to liberate people from a tyrant, now it is to bring democracy to the middle east.  these changes in terminology serving only to protect the public officials who chose to go to war from having to answer to their failures.  these things are the best the world has to offer:  murder, corruption, humiliation, greed, pride (yes, it is a deadly sin), arrogance, bloodlust.  so here we are with people dying every day, people being beheaded by hooded men, prisoners being tortured, a war being waged with no end in site, and still the world turns and each day babies are born and greeted with celebration.  i am not proud to say i am human...not when the images on tv show americans to be bloodthirsty, arrogant, and cruel.  i am not proud to say i am a human...not when, in the name of protecting one's interests, humans choose to torture, kill, and be cruel to other humans.  there is nothing redeeming about war.  there is nothing redeeming about cruelty.  but each day we see these things being praised and lauded, and here i am wondering what it's all about anyways.

        last night i finished a book, touch, by gabriel josipovici.  it was a good book, if you are one who likes essays.  i enjoyed it.  i then turned back to something i had been reading prior to touch.  this book, elizabeth costello, by j.m. coetzee.  i've taken to reading more lately.  this is probably a good thing.  i have a master's degree in english literature anyways, so i might as well use what i have learned and studied to my advantage...for personal enjoyment anyways.  and, my last blog, as you may have seen, listed some books that i plan on reading over the summer.  i really look forward to satanic verses, by rushdie, and i am also thinking of investing some time in reading tristram shandy, by laurence sterne.  all of this reading has got me to thinking about how close and intimate the actual act of reading is.  it's closely personal, an experience between the reader and the page, something that is bound by the trappings of the individual mind.  this, then, got me to thinking about, of all things, death.  how that too is a personal, intimate experience.  we do not share our deaths with other people.  they are ours, closely held, individual, and experience, dare i say, of a single, individual mind.  of course, the same thing could be said about just about anything.  even sex is, in its own way, an individual act...though a mutual gain of satisfaction, it is an individual feeling for each partner, and individual feeling that cannot be shared completely.  this could, through a dark lens, look as though it makes for a lonely world, wherein we feel totally isolated from "other."  i don't know that this is necessarily true, however.  maybe, instead, all of these things are shared experiences instead.  even the seemingly lonely act of reading silently.  perhaps in that act we are sharing with the author in a way that is unique, yes, to each reader, but also in a way that bridges some kind of gap between the writer and the reader, such that the reading of a text is the communication of people, of a writer who pens the text and the reader who then translates the text into an individualized meaning...a kind of interpretation dependent upon both parties...a shared experience.  and certainly death can be a shared experience.  though we expire, our missed presence has an effect on others, and the ceremonies for the dead (the mass, the funeral, the burial) are more ceremonies for the living than they are for the dead.  they are practices of the living, in and effort to commemorate the dead for memory's sake.  thus, this act, too, is shared.  the death is a communal experience, not one of isolation, solitude.  and sex.  of course sex is a shared act.  it couldn't be sex without being shared.  these things require much consideration.

        this morning on my way in to work i saw a lightning bolt crash down far into the distance.  i instantly wondered what it hit, who might have witnessed the smack of electricity.  who may have heard its powerful boom.  several years ago i worked at a local garden center.  it was a stormy day, and thick clouds kept passing overhead.  at one point it rained so hard that the entire crew took shelter inside the small store.  i sat with my back to the front window of the building, the window that faced the parking lot.  there was a crash.  it sounded like a cymbal the size of washington state, and the air tingled with static.  i turned around and saw splinters of wood flying through the air, a small bit of smoke drifting up from the top of a light pole in the parking lot.  the lightning had struck there, splintering the wooden pole at the top, running a long crack down its middle.  it was amazing, really, to see this.  to have witnessed a strike only several yards way.  my coworkers and i were at the end of that powerful boom.  for once, i was at the end of a lightning strike; i saw where it landed, i viewed its affects.  the mystery of lightning was, in fact, solved for me that day.  it does hit the ground.  people do see it hit.  things are broken where it slaps the earth.  the result of lightning, what happened when it hit, was solved for me.  i saw it.  i felt it.  so now when i see lightning, i don't think of it as simply light and power flashing across the skies.  i don't think of it as something peripheral and peculiar.  instead it has taken on a power all its own to me.  i have witnessed lightning and what it can do.  and, though nothing was too ruined and nothing lost its life, i had seen that this element of nature did indeed have the upper hand.  and now, when i see it, i cannot help but think who is at the end of that clap, who is at the end of that thunderbolt witnessing power for the very first time.

         Hallelujah  (Leonard Cohen)  Now I've heard there was a secret chord  That David played, and it pleased the Lord  But you don't really care for music, do you?  It goes like this  The fourth, the fifth  The minor fall, the major lift  The baffled king composing Hallelujah  Hallelujah  Hallelujah  Hallelujah  Hallelujah   Your faith was strong but you needed proof  You saw her bathing on the roof  Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you She tied you  To a kitchen chair  She broke your throne, and she cut your hair  And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah   Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah   You say I took the name in vain  I don't even know the name  But if I did, well really, what's it to you?  There's a blaze of light  In every word  It doesn't matter which you heard  The holy or the broken Hallelujah   Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah   I did my best, it wasn't much  I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch  I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you  And even though  It all went wrong  I'll stand before the Lord of Song  With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah   Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah  Hallelujah

        sometimes you get to thinking that the very end of things really is the very end of things and not a new beginning like everyone likes to think and say.  this music, pumping through this headset, reminds me of flying.  of taking to the air and being alien to gravity.  feeling my body pulled by the forces of flight, lifted from the ground, pulled from rest on a certain surface.  and of a kind of speeding, where your feet cannot touch the ground, where the wind in your hair pulls from every angle, and is pushed likewise.  like there is nothing else but heaven, and even that is uncertain.  i think about a girl who is walking down the street in a blue cotton dress, her hair down around her shoulders, he shoes in her hand.  she walks on the front lawn of the apartment complex to spare her feet the soreness of the hard concrete.  she watches a bus pass by.  she hadn't wanted to catch it, but why not?  she isn't smiling, but isn't frowning either.  it's hot outside, her shoulders glisten, but her face is dry.  remember the time the puppy was small.  it wasn't my puppy i said, it is hers.  the small thing slept on my chest all day, near my heartbeat.  it needed that kind of love.  the love of a heartbeat, the warmth of breath, the closeness of being.  an air conditioner in a window.  she got a good deal on it, and it would keep us cool on the hottest days.  she always thought of us and only us, everything was about making us happy, and we were happy.  the kind of happy a hot summer brings, with love and laughs and living.  mowing the lawn, she swept up for me.  it isn't over, what you have already seen; it lives, you know, in the back of your mind.

         hate a lot of things, but i love a few things, and you are one of them   my parents gave me a watch when i got married.  i never where it anymore.  last night i had that glass of wine like i said i was going to have.  in fact, i had two of them.  two white, shimmering glasses.  i've gotten used to drinking wine alone, with no one around except me and the tv, my cat making a periodic appearance beside me on the couch.  i think i was watching tv, but i can't remember anymore.  if it was on, i wasn't paying any attention.  the silence is growing deafening for me.  it's a lot harder than i thought it would be, being alone.  i think that i had grown so used to someone being around all of the time, so used to close quarters, to sharing space, that now, after an extended period in my own place, my own space, my own little world, i am finding it increasingly difficult to manage.  that isn't to say i don't like being alone, because it does have its better days, better sides, better things.  i can do whatever i want without anyone bothering me.  i can leave messes where i want to leave them.  i can put anything where i want it to be and leave it there for next time, not having to worry about anyone else moving it.  but when the silence bounces off the walls, when there is no one in the next room to call, when there aren't friendly footsteps creaking the floor behind the bedroom door, i realize how quiet life can be, how utterly encapsulated i am in my little, private world, how nothing but the sound of nothing can sometimes fill my ears to the point where i want to cover my head with my pillow and scream just to hear something that doesn't sound just like my breathing, just like my own heartbeat.  last night, for the first time in a long, long time i played a computer game.  i was after the wine, so the screen seemed to glow a little more brightly, a little more livingly, and as a parceled out lots for little, fictitious computer simulated people to live in, as i put down roads and lit up powerplants, as i bargained for economic deals between my town and the next one over, i wondered if those little computer people lived silent lives as well, if in their little fictitious homes, in the fictitious city i built in that digital universe, they too battled with silence, sat looking at the walls wishing that someone would walk past their little fictitious views.  there is a lady we always see in the cafeteria.  she is heavy-set.  she usually buys more than one of everything and she also brings a sandwich or two.  she eats sloppily.  i don't like to watch her eat.  i used to make fun of her.  i used to imagine her life as one of constant disgustingness.  i used to criticize the way she hungrily shoved salad in her mouth and chomped down on her sandwich.  but then i decided just to watch her, to see her besides the eating.  she always eats alone.  she sits there, without anyone to talk to, in her own little world, doing something as simple as eating.  and, as i watched this, as i watched her work her way through her own little world, i wondered if maybe this personless world of hers was as silent as mine can be.  i wondered if maybe she shouted at the walls at home just to hear something that didn't sound like her own whispery breathing.  i wondered if sometimes she wanted someone to walk past her view.  there's nothing funny about that.  there's nothing funny about someone being alone, living in silence.  there's nothing funny about that at all.  there's nothing funny about it, and maybe she is just making her way like i am making my way.  maybe i shouldn't be saying anything about her that isn't the most compassionate, caring thing.  maybe she and i share a certain kind of silence, and lord knows my silence isn't funny...so might not be hers.  the last thing i did last night was send off an email that said "i love you."  despite all that silence, i have that.  lord, do i have that.

        - last night i had a dream my friend and i died in an elevator that slid down its shaft and crashed at the bottom.  we didn't initially know we had died because we got out of the elevator just fine.  turns out, we were actually ghosts and went back to find our bodies twisted in the wreckage.  - it figures.  i find out today, mid-way through a project, that i have been making an error all along.  trouble is that there is no way to go back through what i have already done and make sure this error isn't causing major problems.  this is the way things go with me sometimes.  i don't find out until too late that i am fucking things up.  - last night i watched a bit of professional wrestling.  i tend to like watching professional wrestling because, like both roland barthes and andy kaufman noticed, it is an elaborate ruse that can be a kind of theoretical poetry.  the problem, though, with this newer brand of professional wrestling is that it is quite boring.  it is always the same old, tired wrestler going for the big prize.  the high-flying exciting talent is always involved in matches of lesser interest.  the same old characters are in the same old matches, over and over again.  it is never exciting anymore.  instead it is a boring, repetitious hodge-podge of poorly choreographed matches.  in the days gone by, wrestling seems to move more quickly from match to match, rivalry to rivalry.  you never had time to get bored.  now, each week, you can expect the same wrestler to be involved with the same opponent, week in and week out.  it is tiring, and my interest in this kind of entertainment has waned as a result.  - my new bed is very nice.  it has only been a few days since i received the bed, and in these few days i have found my back feeling better and my rest a bit nicer (though i haven't been sleeping well...this hasn't affected the comfort of the rest i do get).  i am quite glad i went ahead and bought the mattress set.  it is my first major furniture purchase since my separation/divorce, since i moved out of the house i once shared.  it's kind of a pride thing, with me, which is probably what makes the bed so extra comfortable.  - right now i am kind of struggling with a prolonged sadness.  there isn't really much to say about it, nor is there much i want to say about it here.  but, to say the least, it is playing a major role in me being lethargic and lack-luster in the energy and mood departments.  in fact, i am so lacking of care right now that i almost don't feel like updating this blog anymore.  but i do.  mostly because if i don't i will be letting myself down.  and partially because every so often  urlLink she  asks me if i am going to update it...giving me an extra little push to do it.  it's a good thing, really, updating this blog.  it's a place to say what i might not get to say elsewhere, and it is a nice little outlet for writing.  but, back to being sad.  i just can't shake it lately.  - i am in this crazy debate as to whether or not to invest a little bit of credit in getting a modest digital camera.  i don't want anything fancy.  i have a manual camera that is just fine for taking more impressive or important shots.  this digital camera would be moreso for taking fun pictures, for carrying with me to take pictures at odd random moments, or when i see something that is worth a snapshot.  right now i am on the "no" side of the fence, telling myself that i have too much debt already and a camera isn't really NECESSARY right now.  but i am sure that in a couple of days i will be back on the "yes" side of the fence.  i suppose with a little coaxing i will just end up doing it.  but, who knows?  coax me if you'd like.  i could use a little coaxing one way or the other.  - i have stalled reading rushdie's  the satanic verses .  i think it is part of the reason i have bad dreams at night (whenever i read, i read at night.  and reading it before i go to bed has always resulted in bad dreams.  perhaps this cursed book is causing them).  i do want to finish it, however, and move on to roy's  the god of small things .  perhaps i need a little coaxing in this department, too.  - right now i can hear this person speaking into the phone a couple of desks away.  this guy really creeps me out.  he has what appears to be a late 30's early 40's body.  his face mostly shows his age.  but his voice sounds more like someone in his late-teens.  he stares at things in the bathroom.  not at your private parts, but at weird things like the paper towel dispenser and the wall.  staring for what seems to be an inordinate amount of time.  i mean, we all stare at things, but his stares seem to last longer than most, and this is creepy.  - i'm going to go home today and not know what to eat for dinner.  what i have in my refrigerator isn't too promising: a brown head of lettuce (brown because it is old and wilted); eggs that are a week past their suggested use-by date; old gum drops in a tupperware container; a bag of potatoes; a gladware container with one portabella mushroom cap in it.  there has to be SOMEthing i can fashion out of these things that somehow resembles a meal.  - tonight i think i will have a glass of wine.  i bought some cheap chardonnay to cook with the other day, and the rest of the bottle will go to waste unless i drink it.  i am not one who really likes cheap white wines.  not that my tastes are that expensive.  but, i don't want it to go to waste...drink i shall!  - today i am not tired of my work...my work is tired of me.  -  urlLink she  bought my kitten a swirly little green plastic thingie with which to play.  my cat loves it.  the only problem is that she plays with it for about 15 minutes and then, quite mysteriously, loses it.  last night i found it far, far under my couch.  i fetched it out from under the sofa and gave it to the cat.  this morning, when i went to gather her toys before i left for work, i could not find the swirly thing.  it went missing again.  i took a second to look under the couch for it to no avail.  i really wonder if my cat even notices that this toy is gone, or if she just forgets about it the minute she doesn't see it anymore.  it's something i think about a lot: whether or not the cat actually misses thing she has lost or that i throw away.  i wonder if her attention-span is really that long, if her heart is really that wide, if her mind is really that deep.  i'd kind of like to have her be able to talk to me for one full day, for her to be able to spill out her soul to me, tell me what she thinks, how she feels, what she sees through her eyes.

        i don't remember driving in this morning.  i remember getting in my car at the apartment complex.  i remember, sort of, pulling out of the parking lot of my apartment complex.  and then there is a blank.  i vaguely remember someone cutting me off on the road.  but, the first clear memory is of me getting off the freeway onto the road that comes to work.  this happens once in awhile, a complete forgetting of driving somewhere.  in a psychology class in college, my professor, in a lecture, described that sort of lack of memory of driving as a kind of hypnosis.  he said that, in a feat of extreme concentration by the human brain, the mind completely focuses on the road without you even knowing it.  and then, because you were in a state of complete concentration (and relaxation) you have no memory of what occurred (just like those who are hypnotized do not remember themselves clucking like chickens while standing on chairs).  at any rate, whether this is a kind of hypnosis or not, this is a weird thing.  it sometimes freaks me out.  i've heard that in this state i am as safe as i would be if i was feeling "normal," that my concentration is so acute that i would pick up on any irregularity on the road or in the driving pattern and react to it accordingly.  and i trust this.  i trust that my mind is capable of doing this.  but it is weird nonetheless.

        every day i come here and i think the same things.  i hear the same sounds, see the same people.  i get angry at the same things.  i am disgusted by the same people.  and, really, i don't try to be.  each morning i wake up with the will to look at things in a better light, to see things through brighter lens, to avoid being upset by the same stupid things.  and each day i disappoint myself because once i come here i am upset...by everything.  i find no joy, no compassion, nothing redeeming all.  today my pants are too tight.  i have gained 30-40 lbs. as a result of being on medication.  i am over my ideal body weight, and my pants are telling me this is so.  this is just adding to the negativity i feel today.  it is defeating to start each day with glimmers of hope, only to have them dashed by conditions beyond my control.  i wish i could let these things go: if they are beyond my control, why should i worry about them?  still, i am aggravated by just about everything, nothing seems to heal the disgust and the impatience.  nothing seems to soothe the mind and the heart.  i have grown bitter, more bitter than i have ever been.  i find it hard to see the good in anything when everything and everyone just proves to me time an time again that people are fundamentally selfish, greedy, disgusting creatures.  i am irritated by their stupidity, their selfishness, and their lack of concern for those around them.  i am tired of working here, in a corporation that cares only about itself.  i am tired of the self-righteousness of both the company and those it employs.  i am tired of people driving on the streets, their self-concerned antics to get them quicker on the road, cutting others off, risking other's safety to get their big, stupid vehicles to their destinations.  and here i am.  bitter as ever.  angry as ever.  unhappy, discontented, unfulfilled, unrewarded.  trapped in my current situation by an economic condition that i cannot seem to shake.  i have nowhere to go.  i'm trapped in a world that i cannot stand, in a life that i cannot stomach, in a situation i cannot even control.  it is disgusting.  it has sucked the marrow of my soul.  it has made me a hollow, angry human being.  i an a cog in a wheel, and i cannot break out of the machine.  and i want to.  i wake up each morning, smiling, thinking "today will be different...a new beginning."  but each day is the same thing all over again, and my will is zapped, my soul is crushed, my outlook even gloomier than the day before.  i know i have it a lot better than many others do.  i know i have more money than some, more opportunity than others, more ability than many.  i am lucky in that regard.  but what has it got me?  i'd give everything up in a instant just to have something with which i am content, just to live in a world where greed and selfishness didn't exist, just to exist in a place where there was not the constant yoke of economic misfortune.  if this is life, then i hate it.  if this is what it is to live the american dream, then i hate the dream.  it is defeating.  it is crushing.  it drains the soul out of you.  i has drained the soul out of me.  so tomorrow morning i will wake up again, my eyes hopeful, my heart robust...and once again i will be crushed by everything and everyone around me.  and people around me will have their souls crushed, too.  and everyone will once again be a robot for some corporate machine.  everyone will have to watch for their lives on the road as rude motherfuckers run their vehicles over the crowd.  everyone will have to watch people less competent, less intelligent, and less able make more money than them because they are born into a higher class.  everyone will have to sit in a pile of their own filth and be forced to like it because there is no other way in this world.  no other way

        the psychologist is a  urlLink cognitive behavioral therapist , a different sort of animal from a classic  urlLink psychoanalyst .  that means we do things differently.  we look at our behavior as a process and product of our own thinking, and by "re-thinking" certain things, we can, in fact, change our behavior.  this appeals to me.  in this way, what happened to my when i was two years old, how closely i was attached to my mother, or the series of steps in my young development are not the only things that act to develop my character.  in fact, they may play a smaller role than i might think.  i like this idea of re-thinking, of redirecting how one acts or feels based upon a redesigning of the thought process itself.  but, sometimes...sometimes things seem more difficult than that.  sometimes i tend to believe that thought itself doesn't necessarily control the whole of our beings.  that somehow, someway, there is another force at work...something more sinister, even.  something that makes us feel what we feel based not on how we think about it...but based moreso on how the heart reacts to it.  and this, this i think is the flaw in this therapy i am taking...that it doesn't consider matters of the heart as matters of the heart.  it makes everything a matter of the brain...and this, i think, is perhaps its blind spot.  perhaps it is the blind spot of everything.

        so this was my dream:  i was in junior high again.  i was on the school bus.  i had just come from the magicians.  he had shown me the same card trick again.  the one that is too much of a flourish; the one during which i want him to name my card already and dispense with the fancy hand tricks.  so, i am on the bus, and the bus is violent.  the kids on the bus are all male, all dressed very ruggedly.  some in bandanas.  some in studded leather jackets.  it is a rough bus.  a tough crowd.  noisy, too.  there is a ring leader.  he is a pudgy kid, big-boned and heavy for his age.  he is picking on the bus driver, a man who is probably only in his mid-thirties, drives the bus because he likes to do it.  this leader, this tough kid is agitating the bus driver, making it difficult for him to keep his eyes and his mind on the road.  the bus driver is yelling.  i am in my seat, cowering, afraid the scene is growing too rough for me.  suddenly, this tough leader kid is up at the front to the bus.  he has a large, long, black knife in his left hand, he is attacking the bus driver, poking the tip of the blade into the drivers neck.  the driver screams.  the bus stops.  the driver holds his hand to his neck as blood slowly trickles from beneath his fingers.  he is afraid.  the big, tough ringleader kid says something.  i cannot understand it.  i am frightened, trying my best to be cool under the circumstances, afraid for my own life.  suddenly the kid, this tough, heavy kid, lifts his blade into the air and then plunges the sharp edge of the knife into the skull of the bus driver, blood gushing everywhere.  the bus driver doesn't scream, but makes a dull moaning sound.  you can hear blood in his throat as he says, somehow mustering some final words, "you wouldn't do this to your friends."  that is when i wake up.  it is 4:11 am, and i am in a cold sweat.  the cat is sleeping in her usual spot, on the beanbag chair.  i go to the bathroom, my mind still reeling from the dream i just had.  what, why?  what was this dream about?  why was it so goddam vivid?  it was just a dream, i tell myself.  you can go back to bed and it will be gone.  dreams don't last.  they fade away with the next thought.  a fall asleep again.  this time another dream.  i am at a house, perhaps i live there.  there is a girl.  water.  perhaps it is raining, or flooding, or both.  the sun is out, though, and i am inside.  it suddenly becomes nightfall.  we are all waiting.  i want to wait for this girl, but who knows if she is coming.  but, wait.  she is in the next room.  i can't get to her.  candlelight.  that is all there is.  i am writing something.  i remember feeling this nostalgic before, this close to some kind of home.  our clothes are wet, looking for dry ones.  too many people coming and going.  i am alone in a room.  a bed and a dresser.  the sun is coming through the window again.  why can't i see her?  i wake up.  it's time to get ready for work, and it is the last thing i want to do.  but i don't want to sleep either because these dreams are like torture.  they are too vivid, too real.  like i am not in my own body anymore, but somewhere, outside it.  in some other world where other rules apply, reliving my life in a past that doesn't exist but is being made up as i go, because these dreams are like memories, not realities.

        sometimes it isn't enough to say you believe in something.  sometimes it isn't enough to identify yourself with a certain kind of belief system.  sometimes it isn't enough to see yourself through your own critical eye.  sometimes it isn't enough to put labels on yourself.  sometimes you actually have to be what you believe.  i've heard a lot of people lately claiming to be something.  claiming to hold certain values, be certain things, fight for certain causes, but in all truth they are not nearly what they claim to be.  they are not, in any way, beholden to that belief system.  they are what they are because they say they are it, not because the actually are in the eyes of the community.  we get this spin all the time.  presidents and others who hold office say that they work for the people, but we all know special interests and lobbyists hold greater sway that the united voice of the american people.  but, that is an obvious problem for politicians, no matter what the party affiliation.  what is more upsetting to me is the claim elected officials make about representing the whole of the population, the population that elected them to their offices.  this country does not rule by unanimity.  there is no election in this country that only stands if the election is unanimous.  instead, we elect and rule by majority, which means that any elected official only represents a percentage, a fraction, a piece of the community.  no elected official rules my unanimity.  that simply does not exist in our country, and most likely in our world.  what is also troubling is the identification people have with particular political parties or schools of thought.  since my days in grad school i have been troubled with people (males and females alike) who dub themselves feminist because they criticize the patriarchy in research papers.  i am troubled with people who identify themselves as conservative because they were upset with bill clinton, or those who identify themselves as liberals because they do not like george bush.  these kinds of mentalities are simple, closed, unenlightened.  people seem to think that because you are not ONE thing, you must, by default, be exactly the opposite.  people seem to think that because you say something once, you must wholeheartedly belong to a particular group and be representative of that entire ideology.  this is reduction at is very worst.  it is the populace reducing itself to simple set, simple belief systems based upon individual assumptions of association.  it is not, i fear, a true nation of people representing different ideologies, but instead ideologies representing people.  we have become: women who are feminists; men who are conservatives; people who are liberal; dissenters who are socialist.  instead of making the ideology living and breathing, instead of adding fire to the flame of belief, we use the beliefs as simple nametags, as check boxes on our personal inventories, as bumper stickers on our rusty-bodied selves.  we do not stand for the belief, the belief stands for us, and especially only when it is convenient for it to do so.  we have become weak because those ideologies we believe in, we only believe in by association itself.  we are not what we believe.  what we believe is no longer us.  instead, we are what it is most advantageous to believe at any given time.  we are fly-by-night faithfuls who bathe in the ganges one day, lift our arms to christ on the second, and on the third profess our secular independence, all in a week's time representing all that we think we might kind of believe, all for the sake of saying we are part of something.

        (a)  the last thing i remember is lying in bed thinking about how lonely it is to lie in bed yourself.  it had grown increasingly cooler last night, but the air was still damp, and to touch anything was to have it stick to you.  so, there, in bed i thought of things gone by, or better yet, of things i hadn't thought would ever have happened, and i then felt extremely lonely.  (b)  i am typing this, this first draft, on microsoft word.  i like to do that because the spell-check on here is more reliable than others elsewhere.  though, i am not fond of spell-checks because a lot of the time they are stupid and don't like the fact that i do not capitalize anything.  at any rate, there is a button at the bottom of this window, this microsoft word window, that allows you to draw 3-d graphs if you are in graph-mode or something.  it got me to thinking, anyways, about things like computerized graphs and powerpoint and other corporate cosmetics that make things look pretty and professional, and i realized in thinking about this how much i really really hate it all.  how much i wish powerpoints, all over the world, would just break one day and there'd be hundreds, if not thousands, of corporate retards clicking away at their little notebook computers wondering why their not-so-funny icebreaker slide wasn't making the cool applause sound when the name of the company slid across the opening screen.  (c)  corporate retards.  there's a truth for you.  there are very few truths in this world, but that every single person that is a corporate executive is a retard is a truth.  i don't give these people any credit.  none whatsoever.  most of the time they tend to be the most narrow-minded and narrow-focused people in the world.  they only know things about the company they work for, and anything else is alien to them.  i am figuring that most of them don't know a good novel from a bad one, couldn't tell an impressionist painting from a cubist, don't have a real clue about the history of this nation...etc.  that isn't to say everyone should know all these things, but what it shows is that these people, who because of their position in the corporate hierarchy are regarded as geniuses (i say this because my ex-mother-in-law, my boss, and several others have imparted this kind of rhetoric to me) simply because they know how to play the corporate game, not because they have any real knowledge that is worth anything really humanistic in any way, shape, or form.  simply because this person makes nifty powerpoints (see 'b'), knows how to explain away the fact that you make half of what they do but do 90% of the grunt work, and can so effectively manipulate information so as to keep everyone as uninformed about anything as possible, just because of all of this, we call these people smart.  that makes me sick.  it really does.  i know, for a fact, that these people are just retarded.  and call me elitist; i am.  i don't care.  you all know what i am talking about, and you secretly agree with me anyways, so don't play into their "positive spin."  call it as you see it.  they are retards.  pure and simple.  (d)  i have decided to wear my gold bracelet and gold necklace that were given as gifts to me.  it has been about a year since i have worn them.  the cold metal feels nice against my skin.  (e)  today is muggy, but cool.  a lot like last night.  lots of clouds today.  at home, my cat is probably sitting in the dark.  poor thing.  (f)  sometimes being this angry at things hurts a lot.

        last evening there was quite a bit of disturbance in my dwelling.  above me, the bitch who lives upstairs decided to spend 40 minutes treading her fat ass on a treadmill, causing my walls to shake and the ceiling to rumble with the sound of the machine as it groaned along its destinationless path.  outside, across the gardens from me, someone decided to play opera music at a high decibel for a full hour (coincidently at the same time this irritating blonde upstairs "walked" her way on the treadmill).  this morning on the freeway, i was in the correct lane to exit the freeway onto the common street.  as i exited the freeway, a woman in a van from a lane over (the incorrect exiting lane), nearly hit my automobile with her van because she decided she could and would exit the freeway as she saw fit, despite my right of way.  there is, for some reason, a certain disgusting inconsiderate nature about people that i find both appalling and demoralizing at the same time. what in the world gives people the sense that they can do as they please despite the discomfort, inconvenience, irritation, or distraction it causes other people.  now, do not get me wrong.  i am not playing as though i am above the fray.  i am one who is quick to judge people, is impatient, and truly does not like people i find appalling.  i am not, then, saying that i am better than the rest.  still, when i am at home or on the road, i try to be considerate.  i keep my radio low in the apartment.  i obey the traffic laws on the roads.  i do what i can not to make my being an inconvenience to others in any way, shape, or form.  i do my absolute best not to inconvenience or disturb other people, and i wonder why they can't do the same for me.  yesterday i took to pounding on the ceiling for the first time, since the noise of the bitch's treadmill was driving me nuts.  i decided that i would be rude, for once, and i would make noise so my disapproval would be heard.  but, it didn't make me feel good.  instead i felt as disgusting and i feel that bitch above me is for being as inconsiderate as she is.  i don't know what to do.  i don't know what i can do to ease myself from the irritation of other rude, inconsiderate people.  despite it all, i will continue to be polite and considerate like i always am.  and, i suppose all i can do is wish that other people will be the same, that their selfish motives will be no more, that their blinders will be off, that for once in their lives they think of those around them.

        today is a slow day.  it feels like more than a day, more than a minute passing by each 60 seconds, more than a second passing by with each blink of the eye.  things feel long, drawn out, played, stretched beyong their temporal limits.  it is 4:00 where i am, and it feels like it has been that way for days.  it has been quiet, too.  the gentle hum of the computer and periodic clacking of a keyboard somewhere else in this office the only things breaking the silence.  once in awhile a phone rings.  once in a greater while i hear someone talking on the phone.  everything else is silence, really.  so i sit here, the minutes stretching by like little infinities, hearing what i can hear, mostly just this terminal buzzing, and i am forced to ask myself how much more i can take.

        i had to bring home groceries tonight, so i went to the supermarket after work (my favorite supermarket, the big new high-class one they built beside the upscale shopping center next door to my neighborhood.  i like it because, for all the rich people, they have fresh produce.  it isn’t like the more working-class one up the street from me, with the withered working-man’s produce and crowded aisle.  this one, the up-scale one, is for people who aren’t like me, so i like shopping there instead).  it started to storm as i was in the market, so when i came out, it was pouring sheets of rain, and i wasn’t looking forward to the trek to my car.  there was a grocery clerk at the door, however, and he offered to hold my groceries there so i could pull my car up to the entrance-way and avoid carrying my paper bag of kitty litter out under the cloudburst.  i thanked him.  my apartment needed tidying when i got home with the groceries.  i made spaghetti and then washed the dishes, put a photo album away that i was filing pictures into (of mexico, michigan, my baby cousin at our first apartment).  everything was quiet.  i had the tv on, but even the noise from that seemed quiet.  i was waiting, really, for my sister to come over.  she cuts my hair on a monthly basis.  i get it shaved (a number two on the clipper).  she was going to come over with her boyfriend after she got off work at the salon.  i was waiting for her, putting away pictures, lighting candles and incense to cover up the smell of my sweat and my cat.  the apartment grew dark as the night matured.  i didn’t bother turning on any lights.  for some reason, i felt safer in the candlelight, less exposed.  i made a couple of phone calls, no one was home however, so i left a couple of messages on answering machines hoping that someone would bite (someone did bite, too, but that was later).  i sat in the dark most of the night.  my sister came and went, her boyfriend using a glass for a drink of water, my sister babying my kitten, cutting my hair, then turning to the door, making her (their) way home from a long day of work.  i got a phone call, talked for awhile to the sunshine on the other end (it felt good to hear her, it really did), then i just blew out all the candles in my apartment, letting only the pale red glow of my lava lamp light the main room.  it’s a pale red, the kind of red that is hard to see in, so everything seemed extra dark.  i stepped into the kitchen (turned on that light), made a couple of sandwiches for tomorrow’s lunch, then went back to being in the dark.  it’s like that sometimes, you feel in the dark, so you sit in the dark.  the darkness is a good thing, especially on cool summer nights.  it’s like a blanket.  like something that makes you feel somehow at home, even when everything around you seems foreign and dangerous.  i keep thinking about the pictures, now.  how neatly i have filed them away in that album.  things that are only memories, and barely that.  some pictures i don’t even remember taking.  it is sad really, that we forget so much.  that, in the little bit of time we have doing some things we love, we remember so very little detail, and that we only have film and paper to remind us.  or maybe, maybe that is the blessing of it all, that on dark nights, when all you want to be is in the dark, when you have gone grocery shopping in the rain, when you have done your chores, when you have waited for visitors to come, and when they have gone, when you are sitting alone in the dark again, with only the pale red light from a lava lamp to light your field, when all of that happens, there are still those pictures in that album, that box, that envelope, that have you, on the sunshiniest day in mexican history, alone on top of a mayan pyramid, waving down at your photographer, that have you, sunburned and in a pool, that have you asleep with your puppy on your chest...you have those things within your reach, forgotten and out of site, to remind you that perhaps, even, you will forget this night too, and have only more fantastic moments to come.

        i have to buy a mattress.  my old bed is old.  the springs aren't that springy anymore, and it is a twin bed, so it makes it difficult to sleep comfortably, and it isn't advantageous for the nights when i have someone to nestle with beneath the sheets.  the problem is that i do not want to spend too much money on a mattress and box spring, and no matter where i go looking for these items, i can't seem to find anything that really fits into my budget.  i spent last night rearranging the furniture in my bedroom to make way for the new bed, when i get one.  i ended up doing nothing but breaking my desk and making a big mess.  but, i moved everything nonetheless, and now my one relatively roomy bedroom is a little more cluttered, but at least there is space for the new bed.  my cat helped by getting in the way the whole time, tripping me up when i was moving dresser drawers, standing in the way as i walked my desk, end by end, through the center of the room.  i got a call.  she wanted to pick me up and get ice cream.  it was a relief.  i was sweating, and ice cream sounded good.  it was a nice break from everything.  we played catch with a football afterwards, trying to line up for the catch under a darkening sky.  this whole chain of events--the needing of a new mattress; the rearranging of furniture; the buying of ice cream--makes me realize how perfectly ordinary day-to-day existence is.  sometimes there is really nothing spectacular about living; you just poke on, day to day, making your way through your own existence, with little delights coming now and again (ice cream) and hard work filling up the rest (moving furniture).  the fact of the matter is that there is something beautiful and remarkable in that perfectly ordinary day-to-dayness.  that, no matter how ordinary it all seems, how trivial the little stuff really, truly is, there is no doubt that this is the stuff that makes up lives, and that each life, filled with its own little ordinary, unspectacular events, is truly remarkable.

         everything that keeps me together is falling apart...   on the radio driving in, stuck in traffic, oh no that truck looks like its load is going to tip off, the motherfucker switching lanes like a bat-out-of-hell, is she cutting in front of me, no, blinker's just on for no reason at all, just going straight, all of us, on the long freeway to wherever-destination.  last night was pizza and three vodka tonics.  brian gives me a dirty looks, says that you shouldn't drink mixed drinks, shows you can't handle the pure stuff, and meanwhile b (not brian) is quiet and i am wondering what is on his mind anyways.  the bar mirror doesn't seem to cast my reflection tonight, or at least i don't notice it, and i drink from the well because i am watching my money, but b gets absolute because he doesn't care.  the three drinks don't even phase me, and i can walk upright to the car on my own, though i had hoped to be a little bit looser than this.  i apologize for being so quiet tonight.  i get home just in time to turn the tv on and off again, and pick up the book to read, so i read a few pages and nothing seems to be coming off the page this time.  the words just stare at me, flat, the story going along as it is supposed to, but all the while i can't keep the characters straight and one devilish man resembles another, and all of these faces and names are blurring, and i wonder if it is finally the three vodkas hitting me, though i realize it isn't and that, really, i am just probably tired.  the cat purrs.  climbing into bed and i can't sleep, can't even get comfortable because nothing is right.  i have a bunch of pillows and they are nice and soft, and i don't need a cover, it is warm enough outside. so i am there, lying in bed, waiting for sleep to come and it won't, or doesn't, for some time, so i am left thinking about how uncomfortable i am in that bed, how much i want a new bed already, all i have to do is go buy one already, but i never find the time, or if i do, i don't make the time to go do it anyways.  lie=to be in a horizontal or prostrate position.  you have to be active in thought, you have to pursue whatever comes to you mind.  let it soak in sure, but push those boundaries, stretch the perimeters, make the edges not the edges anymore but think beyond what you are already thinking about, look at it from as many angles as you possibly can, then look at the angles themselves, and those angles, and so on.  this is what i think about, my last thought before sleeping.  i dream of a magician and his card tricks.  overly complicated.  i just want him to know what card i am holding, not to make some elaborate flourish to produce my card.  just tell me what i have in my hand.  read my mind.  see what i see.  just to it already without the fancy shuffle and meandering fingers.  let me just hold the card already and you tell me what it is, and if you are right then i will say bravo!  nothing is ever that easy.

        i have never been overwhelmed by work.  that is, i have never taken my job seriously enough to be concerned about it to such an extent as to lose sleep or cause anxiety over it.  but, for some reason this has changed the past week.  perhaps it is a sign of getting older and more responsible (though i doubt that).  or, perhaps it is a sign that the sheer amount of effort it takes for me to complete my daily tasks effectively in order to earn the menial pay that i earn has become exponentially greater than it should for the amount earned.  in essence, i am not getting paid enough to do what i do, so it is becoming more and more difficult to do what i do and feel good about it.  this is not a new condition for anybody.  everyone thinks this, i bet, so perhaps i am just coming into my own for feeling this way.  at any rate, it is eating at me and i don't like it.  there are a lot of things i don't like, too...so i really do not need yet another thing to complain about.  and i DO spend too much time complaining.  this is not a good thing either.  makes me seem to negative, like an old grumpy man...which i do not want to look like.  old.  grumpy.  especially grumpy.  still, times like these, when all else seems to be failing, and my outlook looks bleak...and i am poor and whining about it...these times remind me, of all things, of our good man robinson crusoe, who, trapped on a deserted isle by no choice of his own, is forced by sheer necessity to make the very best of a situation that could not even seem to be even remotely good.  despite his misfortunes, despite going hungry at first, despite having no contact with the outside world, crusoe was able to survive, and furthermore to survive well at that.  he kept going regardless of the coursing waves of misfortune around him.  he didn't give up.  i suppose i shouldn't either.

        never knowing what is going on is a difficult situation to be in.  one day it is something and another day it is a another, and all the while you get used to singing the blues.  yesterday i went to the comedy shop, again.  have been there many many many times in the past few weeks because me and the lady keep winning tickets to see comedy acts.  so we went again, vowing not to fill out the little form so that we don't win tickets yet again and don't, then, feel compelled to visit the comedy shop for the something-teenth time in only a few months.  the main act and the feature act were pretty good.  your typical funnymen, with their usual "go-one-way-then-cut-the-other-way-oh-i-zigged-when-you-zagged-gotcha" humor.  always good.  always funny.  always a good time.  the opening act was another story.  he was tall, lanky.  he had long blonde hair.  he was a bizarre, ageless looking fellow who told mediocre jokes and had the place a-buzz with laughter of obligation not of compulsion.  i felt bad for him, he was a hometown boy, trying so hard.  he was sorta rag-tag.  i felt for him.  after the show i was in the bathroom, taking a leak at the urinal.  there were other men leaking there, too.  not at the same urinal, but at different ones.  each of us peeing out the beer we had had during the show.  in comes the skinny, blonde-haired comedian.  he greeted everyone in the rest room by saying, very loudly, "hey, how'd you all get in my dressing room?!"  he was hungry for laughs.  he found few.  i continued peeing.  he stepped up to an empty urinal and said, again hungry for laughs, "hey, this must be where all the dicks hang out in cleveland!"  he was loud, cracking jokes, looking for recognition, hoping we would laugh.  instead, there were a few obligatory low-chuckles.  no one was budging.  he wanted to be, but wasn't, funny.  i kept peeing.  he said, just as loudly, just as hungry for laughter, "of course, mine just kinda pokes out, it doesn't really hang."  now we are all uncomfortable in the restroom.  his jokes had flopped.  no one laughed.  why had he taken his act off the stage and brought it into the john of all places?  what did he want?  why was he bombarding us with jokes?  why was he expecting laughter in a place where men are exposing themselves to the elements to relieve their bodies of the pressure of liquids?  i finished peeing (i peed a long time.  i had to go really bad.  i had had a lot to drink).  i walked out feeling bad for the guy, feeling uncomfortable for him.  part of me wanted to put my hand on his shoulder and say, "you know, buddy, it's ok.  sometimes things just aren't funny.  and, it's ok...it's ok to flop once in awhile."  but my feeling is that this isn't a "once-in-awhile" thing for him.  i get the feeling his life IS this way...one flopping joke after another.  like being in stage where the people laugh because silence is more uncomfortable than pretending.  there was nothing to do but let him go, let him wade the waters, let him bomb one time after another.  and, really, maybe this is best.  maybe it was best to let another man flop horribly in the most awkward stage of all: the restroom.  maybe it was best to let him nudge his way through the awkward silences, groping for at least a chuckle, a grin, a sparkle in an eye, even.  maybe that is what he lives for, the single laugh.  the one person.  the one voice.  maybe he thrives in that lonely darkness of failed entertainment.  maybe, just maybe, his light isn't in the success, but in the search itself.

         ...only to find gideon's bible...   this line from the beatles' rocky raccoon keeps on running through my head.  so, thinking it was a sign from above, i googled the term and stumbled across someone's blog.  it was fun to read.  which is what i am looking for, by the way, fun things to read.  i have my share of novels being juggled by the old brain at the moment ( the satanic verses ,  a portrait of the artist as a young man ), so there are enough of those to go around, and i am quite disenchanted with poetry lately.  nothing has really made me excited since i was shown  urlLink this little treat  over a year ago.  there is always the newspaper, which i bought yesterday for fifty cents.  there was nothing in it except silly patriotic articles that made me want to scream.  not simply because they are patriotic, but moreso because they are BLINDLY patriotic, as if big brother can do no wrong.  i tried reading billboards for fun.  seeing what silly advertisers had to say.  but there again i am disappointed.  advertising is really, really stupid, and since about 75% of american life is consumed by advertising, that makes about 75% of american life that is really, really stupid.  take away another 10 percent or so for blind patriotism, and you are left with about 15% of american life that is really worth thinking about.  of that 15%, there is certainly SOMEthing worth reading.  maybe these blog things.  maybe THEY are worth reading.  though ever since i stumbled upon one that is nothing but a propaganda mill for some midwesterner's antiquated belief system, i am under the impression that 99% of these blogs aren't worth reading either...that 99% probably includes mine.  so.  i have 15% of american culture to sift through to find something fun and provoking to read.  or i could just turn to songs...65% of which are not worth hearing/reading anyways.   ...only to find gideon's bible...   there are always the beatles.  they're not american anyway.

        it has been a long time since i could honestly say that i have had a good night's sleep.  every morning i wake up incredibly tired, and i slug about trying to keep my eyes open as i brush my teeth, shower, and ready myself for work.  during the night i wake up once or twice, either frightened awake by bad dreams or pained by an accumulation of urine in my bladder.  after i am awake, i do fall back to sleep, but it is not a restful sleep as i am, despite my best efforts, consciously aware that in a matter of time my alarm will sound (its first of several wake-up alarms) in an attempt to wake me to get ready for a day of work.  last night i had a really disturbing dream.  in this dream, i lived in a large, spooky house, the kind you see in horror movies.  and, in this dream, the chick i am dating fell sick.  i helped her into bed and covered her with blankets.  a friend was close by, helping me with her (i cannot remember if this friend was a dream version of a real friend, or if the friend in this dream was simply an imaginary person).  as she grew sicker, my friend and i realized that there were zombies lurking around the lower floors of the house, and there were zombies outside, too.  my friend and i, in an effort to keep ourselves and the chick safe, boarded up the doors to the room, and did our best to secure out place in the house from the rest of the zombie-filled premises.  the chick grew sicker.  we (my friend and i) were very worried.  soon we heard zombies pounding on the walls and floor.  we were surrounded.  once again we made sure our room was secure.  when we turned around from our work, we went back to check on the chick in the bed.  she didn't look any better.  in fact, she, too, had turned into a zombie!  now my friend and i were trapped in the room with my one-time-chick-turned zombie!  we had to escape from her because surely she would eat our brains, so we fought her to the best of our ability.  one of us had a knife and we took turns stabbing her now dry, bloodless chest.  finally my friend said something along the lines, "what we have to do is cut her up and burn her body, and then we have to take her to the cemetery!"  we beat her down into the bed, immobilizing her now that she was afflicted with the blood-thirsty desire to suck our brains.  she was hideous.  the girl i once found sexy was now a beast of crumbling flesh and sulfurous stink.  we beat her down and used the knife to cut her dry, crumbling body to pieces.  then, in a fire we lit in the room's fireplace, we burned her limbs, torso and head.  i was, naturally, sad to see someone i had loved turn into a zombie and then have to incinerate her in a fireplace, but i had to survive!  after she was sufficiently burned, and all that remained was a heap of ashes, we gathered her remains in a small coffin-like box.  once we had the box secure, we busted out of the barricaded room and rushed past all the zombies outside.  we ran off to the close-by cemetery and left the ash-filled box outside of an old, marble mausoleum, and then promptly left the cemetery.  that broke the spell.  having burned my love-turned-zombie, and having left her ashes in a small box in the local cemetery, all of the zombies once attacking the town vanished, and all was back to normal.

         running for class president   i had a dream of being in high school last night: this time it was a good one...i was trying to advertise myself for class president, but i wanted to represent the darker side of class politics.  instead of putting up my own posters advertising my candidacy, i would instead spray-paint in black my motto onto the other candidates' posters.   collections   when i was in mexico a couple of years ago, i was walking on the beach, keeping my eyes down to try to find seashells in the sand.  i was kicking the stones i found with my toes (i wasn't looking for rocks), when i kicked what appeared to be a stone that looked like a perfect half-circle.  noticing the near perfect shape of this one-time circle, i picked the stone off of the ground.  turns out this stone wasn't just any stone, but some kind of fossilized sea creature (it looks like some kind of ancient urchin or sponge).  after finding this on the ground, i looked a little closer at some of the rocks.  in addition to that interesting find, i also found another interesting fossil: this time is was a stone that appeared to be a grouping of tiny tubes...something that looked like some kind of ancient coral or, perhaps, plant life.  at any rate, these two finds on the beach sparked in my a kind of fever...a collector's fever, and suddenly i found myself looking at all kinds of stones, hoping to find my next fossil.  now i have a tiny, but proud, collection of ancient fossils, all on display in a little cabinet in my apartment.  and these are only some of the things i collect.  in addition to these ancient stones, i also collect coins, pez dispensers, books, and antique leaves from books.  i am a bit obsessive about my collections, and i am always looking to add to them.  i wonder, though, why we collect things.  what is it about certain objects that intrigues us?  what is it about old books, gems, coca-cola memorabilia, little porcelain dolls, matchbox cars, model airplanes, animal statuettes, cars, and antiques that sparks in us the desire to keep so many of them?  it is an interesting thing, collecting.  i wonder why we do it; i wonder what purpose it serves our species.  i love collecting things, but i wonder: why do i do it at all?

        last night i was watching broadcasts from the democratic national convention.  it was boring, to say the least.  but, still, i have a fondness for jimmy carter, so i wanted to see him speak.  while watching these broadcasts, however, i really became happy for the fact that i am not in politics.  it seems that when one is in politics, one instantly becomes unable to answer simple questions.  for example, the commentator hosting one of the broadcasts asked his democratic panel whether john kerry a better man than george bush, yes or no.  not one panelist could muster simple yes or no answer.  each one gave an elaborate response, skirting the actual question: "john kerry has proven he is an effective politician...," "john kerry is a hard working man who understands the people...," "john kerry served bravely in vietnam...."  i am smart enough to realize that this is typical political-speak, and that it isn't politically wise for a politician to be blunt about the worth of another man, but what i would really like to see some day is a politician that ISN'T afraid to say what he/she is thinking, a politician who is willing to say "yes" or "no" to a potentially difficult question.  this would be a wonderful thing to see, and regardless of affiliation, i think i would gain a deep respect for the individual who manages to do this, for at least that person would have the guts to say something that could be perceived as politically dangerous, and that person would avoid the transparent political-speak that does nothing but make everyone who uses it look like a blind fool.

      i really did end up enjoying the ethiopian food adventure i went on this weekend.  the dishes were delicious, and the coffee afterwards was quite spicy and yummy.  i enjoyed scooping the paste-like food up with the spongy, flat bread.  the best stuff was the  urlLink kik-alicha  .  i rewatched  american beauty  this weekend and left with mixed feelings about the film.  in the very first instance, i really like it.  but, the more i think about it, the more i find that i don't like about it.  i think, perhaps, it is a bit over-rated.  and i am not sure exactly what i mean by this.  it used to be one of my favorite films, but not anymore.  the second movie i watched this weekend was  urlLink  napoleon dynamite  .  though it moved rather slowly, i really found this one to be quite funny.  it is what it is.  it is quite entertaining and well worth admission to see it.  i spent most of today trying to think of something worthwhile to publish in this blog today, but i couldn't.  instead all i could muster were these tiny reviews of my weekend's entertainments.  oh, we went for a walk around cleveland's university circle this weekend.  i took some pictures of the peter b. lewis building at case western reserve university and also some pictures of the grounds outside the cleveland museum of art.  watch for these in the coming days on my  urlLink fotolog .  these should start popping up on there around wednesday.

       take my hand, take my whole life, too   last night i continued reading  urlLink garcia marquez's   urlLink  one hundred years of solitude  .  i am barely through the beginning of this one, but already i like it a lot.  it is a fresh and airy book, and though it is over 300 pages long, it does not seem like it will be such a lengthy book.  the prose, though translated, is not dense, and the words have a life to them that one doesn't find much elsewhere in literature.  comparing this text to the beginning pages of my most recent read,  urlLink  the satanic verses  , i must say that i think garcia marquez's book will be more enjoyable, and much more to my liking than  urlLink rushdie's  text (this isn't to say i dislike  the satanic verses , rather i am pointing out that one text is less dense than the other, and therefore more enjoyable to me).  this week has been a long week.  it's also been an emotional rollercoaster for me.  in the long period of the week, around tuesday and wednesday, i found myself trapped in a kind of quiet that made me melancholy, or rather, not melancholy, but just plain sad.  i think that this short bout of sadness was sparked by a couple of days worth of troublesome dreams.  the worst, or most troublesome, dream came the night before last.  i was getting married again, but this time at someone's apartment.  this fellow i went to high school with, and no one was happy that i chose his wet, dank basement apartment, (in)complete without carpeting, to be the place where i repledged my life to my ex-wife.  we were happy to be getting married again, but for all the wrong reasons.  i woke up with a sickening case of nostalgia, both for my marriage and for this old friend, a friend i fell out of favor with during college.  and this nostalgia wasn't because i necessarily miss these things or people as objects, but because i miss the old warm feelings they used to give.  not that i don't have very nice warm feelings now, either.  it's just that sometimes memory paints beautiful pictures of the past, pictures that probably never were in the first place, but beautiful pictures nonetheless, and sometimes you want to "recapture" these beauties...recapturing, really, things that probably never were.  thinking of all of this actually makes me treasure even more what i have now, believe it or not.  it might not sound like it, it may not even look like it, but the truth of the matter is that i really do treasure what i have in my life now in a way that i never really treasured things before.  instead of letting the moments pass me by, like i used to, i hold on to things more dearly.  and, perhaps, this is simply because i am becoming more romantic (in the literary sense), and am seeing things for their cosmic beauty.  or, perhaps, i am becoming more realistic (in the literary sense), and am seeing things for what they are and realizing that it can't get any better than this.  or, to rethink this even more, maybe it is because i am growing more and more scared, afraid that i will lose something when i don't even know it is there.  or perhaps it is because i am in love...this is much more likely.  that is something really special.  it's only july, but i really can't wait for christmas this year.  i love christmas trees and ornaments.  i've kind of been using this blog to spill out my guts lately.  i don't know if that is a good thing or not.  in one sense, i am making these things very public by posting them on the www and letting anyone read them who will.  on the other hand, i don't think anyone but a handful of people actually read this thing anyways, so it isn't as though the whole world is seeing what i am writing.  regardless of readership, i am not too ashamed of saying things on here, which scares me.  you see, when i am face to face with someone, i have a hard time saying anything at all.  i don't think i have told anyone exactly what i am feeling at any point in time, face to face, for a really long time.  instead, i use this thing, this blog, to convey what it is i am feeling at any given point.  and, i think, this is both a good and bad thing, all wrapped in to one.  in one sense, it gets things out there into the open, but at the same time it really keeps them close to me, letting me say what i need to say without really saying it to anyone at all.  such a double-edged sword, i think.  not complaining...not doing anything really.  just observing.  i am trying  urlLink ethiopian food  tonight for the first time.  i must admit that i am a little bit scared of what it might be like.  it took me awhile to get used to indian food (now i REALLY like it), so i am hoping that this experience does not mimic that of my indian food experience (taking such a long time to like it).  i am sure it will all be good and that i am worrying about nothing.  truthfully, i am excited to learn a little bit about the culture (at least the culinary culture) of an african nation.  i have had this mini fascination with africa for a few years now, being enchanted by the artwork of the continent, and being enchanted with the literature of  urlLink south africa  (particularly of  urlLink j.m. coetzee ) for some time.  i should really take the time to read some  urlLink nadine gordimer .  i have a peach that is growing soft on my desk.  i don't have a lunch today.  perhaps i will eat that.

      check out  urlLink abbie the cat has a posse .  i am trying to drink less soda pop lately.  so far, so good.  i am currently resisting the urge to have a coca-cola.  hopefully the urge will pass.  things are boring today; i have nothing to do.  a double-edged sword, having nothing to do.  ah, screw it.  i am probably going to end up having a coke anyways.  some willpower i have.

      i saw a good movie this weekend:  urlLink eternal sunshine of the spotless mind .&nbsp; the movie gets its title from alexander pope's poem "Eloisa to Abelard" (How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!/The world forgetting, by the world forgot./Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind!/Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;), a point made in the movie.&nbsp; This was nice, that the movie mentioned the source of its title.&nbsp; it shows that  urlLink charlie kaufman , at the very least, pays homage...and attention...to his sources.  &nbsp;  anyways, the movie is about a man who decides to have the memory of his ex-girlfriend erased, but when the procedure is done, he realizes how much he loves each and every memory, good and bad, and tries to hold on to all the memories (though he fails).&nbsp; this got me to thinking about how difficult it would be, really, to rid yourself of every single memory that exists about a particular individual.&nbsp; the movie's fiction depicted the memory as a series of nodes, individualized compartments of idea that could easily be located and erased; but, our minds do not work that way.&nbsp; instead our memories are complex and interwoven, much like the weaving of a complex textile, so that one memory is not apart from another, but rather, intricately linked to each other memory in a way that would make it difficult to erase one and just one particular memory (this commentary isn't to fault the movie, just to point out my recognition that what seemed simple in the movie is actually much more complex in real life; this is not an error in the movie, but what the movie makes me realize as a result of its fiction).  &nbsp;  at any rate, this movie simply reinforced in me the knowledge that memories are difficult, but precious things, and that, good or bad, we should treasure them, in some way, as those things that make up who we are.  &nbsp;  problem/irritant:  &nbsp;  old people in movie theaters are noisier than anyone else.&nbsp; a couple of old women, post-retired...post-most-things...sat down next to us in the theater.&nbsp; the previews were on.&nbsp; they were talking really loud through them.&nbsp;  urlLink she  turned to the old women and asked them to "be quiet, please," but the old women did not oblige, instead claiming that these were just commercial previews and that they didn't need to watch them.&nbsp; so they continued to talk.&nbsp; finally i got fed up and shouted "shut it" loudly.&nbsp; this didn't work either.&nbsp; they continued straight into the beginning of the movie.&nbsp; i guess when you get old you are suddenly allowed to be rude, and suddenly you are allowed to do whatever you want whenever you want.&nbsp; makes me sick.&nbsp; if you are going to be rude, then DON'T come to the movies.&nbsp; don't come ANYwhere.&nbsp; there is no need for people like you to be disrupting everyone else's good times.  &nbsp;  went down to  urlLink ohio university  in athens, ohio this weekend.&nbsp; was enjoyable.&nbsp; saw the university a bit, visited the town of athens, shot some pool, had some good food...but also visited some supposedly  urlLink haunted places .&nbsp;  urlLink the ridges , an old mental institution and its accompanying cemetary, is a creepy place with lots of weird vibes.&nbsp; we went during the day, so the place was significantly less creepy than it most likely is at night.&nbsp; lots of unmarked tombstones (well, marked, but only with a number) in the cemetary.&nbsp; a completely creepy place.&nbsp; the second place we visited was another cemetary, during the early part of the night.&nbsp; THAT was a creepy place.&nbsp; we visited the grave of two little girls, a grave marked with a statue of the two girls that, in the night hours, looks as though it is going to come to life at any moment.&nbsp; very creepy.&nbsp; you can catch some of the pictures from our trip to athens on my photlog this week.&nbsp; and, yes, i will have a picture of the creepy little-girl tombstone statue in the coming days.  &nbsp;  i had a really nice weekend, really.  &nbsp;  i saw  urlLink anchorman: the legend of ron burgundy  again last night with  urlLink ragemonkey .&nbsp; i have decided that  urlLink steve carell  is a real genius.&nbsp; he has the perfect stupid-smile, and pulls of being clueless better than anyone i have ever seen.   &nbsp;remember to check out my pictures from athens, ohio all this week on my  urlLink fotolog .  &nbsp;

        this morning was the worst morning in a long time.  when carrying a garbage back out to the apartment dumpster, the contents of the bag (particularly an old container of papa john's garlic sauce) spilled all over me.  my pants and shirt were soiled with garlic oil and aroma.  i had to go back into the apartment to change.  as i opened my door, my cat escaped and ran up to the third floor full speed.  i had to chase after her, all the while reeking of garlic oil.  needless to say this did not set my morning off great.  so far the rest of this day isn't so bad.  i came into $100 that i wasn't expecting.  i also got a free 6-pack of coca-cola (granted, it is coca-cola 2, so it doesn't taste as good as the original).  so, things aren't that bad, despite the rotten morning i had.  i'm finding it increasingly difficult to care about what i am doing.  there is a growing apathy in me.  this is probably not a good thing at all, and i have to work to keep this from taking over me.  regardless.  just checking in again.  not much to say.  sometimes i think i should stop writing this blog because i am running out of ideas and i don't want this thing to become some kind of pity-party-page (which, sadly, i think it has already become).  maybe less periodic updates will do the trick.

        this morning when i woke up the apartment was stuffy and humid.  i immediately turned on the air conditioner so that my cat could live in relative comfort while i spent the day at work. (work, incidently that i did not want to go to in the very least.  this job has become a tiring, draining effort on me.  the office does nothing but create low morale, and offers no real benefit to being employed there.)  this weekend was fun.  i went swimming and to a  urlLink drive-in  movie.  the bathrooms at the drive-in were, at best, completely disgusting.  i think i vomitted a little into my mouth on entry to the place.  they need to take a firehose to that place and rinse it all down...no, rinse is too weak a word.....perhaps BLAST it all down.  something.  or light it on fire and let it burn hot and fast.   something  to disinfect the place.  i think, and this is saying a lot, that that is perhaps the most disgusting bathroom i have been in this year.  i don't have much to say today, really.  just those few little details about my life that serve to prove that, yes, i am still alive.  still breathing.

        this quotation is from the derrida website (the link can be found on the right hand side of this page).  i like this one.  "Monsters cannot be announced.  One cannot say: 'here are our monsters',  without immediately turning the monsters into pets."    Jacques Derrida, "Some Statements and Truisms about Neologisms, Newisms, Postisms, Parasitisms, and other small Seismisms", The States of Theory, ed. David Carroll, New York: Columbia University Press, 1989. 63-94, here: 80    i have a fondness for derrida, and have had once since my days as a graduate student at the university.  he's been called everything from a genius to the anti-christ.  something good about that: being both absolutely lauded and absolutely despised.

        i've been wondering where i expect myself to turn lately.  that is, i have been sort of struggling with finding some kind of sure grounding, something reasonably certain that i can set my heart to, place my lean against, heap the brunt of my weight upon.  i feel sort of like a nomad, wandering through my existence, trying to find some place to set up camp, a permanent camp, something that will be solid and last forever.  but, i don't know what i expect.  i don't know what i am looking for.  i have, by all accounts, a modest, but not-at-all-underprivileged lifestyle.  i have all i need and want.  i am in a great relationship.  i have good friends.  i have a fairly decent job.  true, my new sandles don't quite fit all that well, they are tight and i am getting blisters, but those kinds of irritations can be ignored.  and, yes, this is the worst of my actual physical trials at this point, so i am lucky.  luckier than most.  i have all the promise i can hope for at this point in time, whatwith a year passing me by that was, at best, troubling and sad...and economically crippling.  right now i am doing okay with what i have.  but something, still, is missing from the mix.  there is something i cannot put my finger on,  but something that seemingly is missing in my life.  i am betting, however, that this thing that is missing is actually my own security.  i don't feel secure in anything.  i don't feel grounded.  i don't feel ready to take on the world day by day, and it is a safe bet that this probably stems from some kind of insecurity...or, even worse, a deep underlying fear.  whatever the case may be, something is not quite right in  this  state of denmark.  i need to find a way to shake this.  and i need to do it myself.  i have heard it from everyone else already, and, yes, it all makes sense.  but this terrible feeling has to go, and it has to go by my work/action/will alone.  and, until i can find my way through this, i will just have to battle it every day until, whatever the solution, i find myself in sight of land.

        i just bought a digital camera for myself.  it was a hell of a lot of money (money i do not have), but the enjoyment i get from taking pictures with it certainly outweighs the burden it places on my credit.  so far i have taken it to the zoo and to the beach...  check out my photographs at my fotolog:  urlLink http://www.fotolog.net/thenumbereleven   i'll be posting pictures there regularly from now on.  the permanent link to my fotolog appears on the right hand side of this webpage.  please do check it out from time to time.

         urlLink yeknomegar =brilliant.  quite enough said with that.  i mean, who could see the world in such a perfect light, for all its failings and rewards?  and talk about potential...i mean, right here, in that mind there is something i wish i had, and i don't know what it is, even.  i don't know where he gets it, i don't know how he got it, but i want it (or wish i had it), and it makes me envious.  my first memory of him, clear one at least, occurs in about the sixth grade.  we were in the same reading class and we had to make little posters and reports about what we wanted to be when we grew up.  i don't remember what my offering was: most likely i was wanting to be a politician or scientist.  maybe a teacher.  at that point i would have taken anything (and sadly i think i am at the same point now).  anyways, his was memorable: he wanted to be, according to the report, a statistician for professional sports.  i remember being in awe of this choice, not so much for the profession itself (i have never really cared about sports all that much), but i was in awe of the word.  how did a kid my age, with a similar relative knowledge capability to mine, know such a big word, and how did he know this word was what he wanted to be when he grew up.  this line continues...  i remember in high school how he was, seemingly, dead-set on being a doctor.  if i remember correctly, he wanted to something having to do with the heart.  i thought that was great, that he could have enough umph to want to do something like that, and to work his ass off at his studies to get himself into a position where a promising school might like him enough to offer him a scholarship, and so on.  he was valedictorian and all that, all the honors.  all i could muster in high school was some very serious humiliation, and a seemingly decent run at high school politics.  then came a series of choices that i think made him a better man...  his choice, as i remember it, was between two local colleges.  one, a reputable school for the sciences; the other, a relatively locally respectable institution that valued its liberal arts manifesto, but produced, at best, mediocre academics.  a purely logical choice for him would have been to choose the science-focused school, the larger, more reputable institution of higher learning.  he didn't.  he actually chose the one where he felt more comfortable.  then in college (i happened to go to the same place), more choices.  a start in pre-med that quickly turned to a philosophy major, then to an english major in the matter of what seemed like a semester or two.  and through all of this he seemed to be coming to a place where he seemed more comfortable, more secure.  he wrote poems.  and he wrote stories.  he made me mad, he could do it better than i could ever imagine trying.  he made it simple, and clear, and seem so easy.  he could do it, and do it well...and make no fuss about it.  and he took all criticism, good and bad, so well...so calmly.  he became focused...he became good.  so, what to do with all this praise?  nothing.  he knows he's got it.  it's just a matter of timing now...what move to make next, what leap to leap at, what risk to risk.  and he's fallible, clearly.  he's disappointed, upset, crossed someone time and again.  but he's trustworthy, too.  and that says more.

        today i am listening to old mix cds.  it's a "be quiet" kind of day.  i don't have much to say, and when i do feel like saying something, i can't seem to find the words.  neil young's voice is like glass.  it's also one of those days when i feel like i have already seen the entire world wide web, and i haven't found anything i like.  norah jones' voice is like a warm, soft blanket.  she henna tattooed me this weekend: a little sun design on the inside of my arm.  it is growing darker, as the book she referred to said it would.  it is a nice way to remember her while she is away...her doodle on my skin.  i also have a painful headache today.  a throbber that just won't quit, even after a dosage of pain pills.   wow, look at you now, flowers in the window...   it is going to be a long week.

      it's only august, but it feels like autumn to me.  i checked the temperature: it is 65.  the sun is out, clouds litter the sky--big, puffy white ones, the kind that periodically pass in front of the sun, cutting off the light for a minute, making the earth just that much cooler.  the leaves are green now, it's still summer, but i felt as though they should all be dry and blowing along the concrete as i walk from my apartment to my car, my arms covered in goosebumps.  i listened to a cd on the way in today, a cd i usually only listen to in autumn, a cd that reminds me of the first days back at the university after a long, hot summer.  i can't help but feel melancholy listening to the lyrics as they pour from my speakers...reminding me of things that were always beyond my control and that are now just caught in the freeze-frame of the past, things that aren't any more, but that seem to be struggling for life in my memory.   "the first part of every day for me..."    "yes, this is love for the first time!"   i like this feeling.  i like the colder air touching my skin.  i like the wind that gives goosebumps.  i like the feeling that the world is turning, ever so slightly, always just beyond my control.  despite the unrest it causes in my heart, despite the chill it gives to my soul, despite the melancholy it brings, i like it because, somehow, it gives me some kind of happiness...a happiness i just can't put my finger on, a happiness that isn't about me, but that is about the world altogether, about the dry, crunchy leaves, about the clouds in the sky, about the students in their books, about having tears in your eyes and feeling okay about it.

        i'm wearing the same shirt again.  i don't know exactly what that means, really.  i wore this shirt just the other day, but i don't remember which day.  so, i am thinking that people are noticing and saying, "oh man, he just wore that shirt the other day!  doesn't he have any other clothes?"  of course, i am probably just out of my mind.  people probably don't notice at all.  and if they do notice, they probably don't care.  lately home has been a place that i do not want to be.  something just isn't right about it.  and, this fact has gotten me to thinking about this poem by philip larkin:   Home Is So Sad  Home is so sad. It stays as it was left, Shaped in the comfort of the last to go As if to win them back. Instead, bereft Of anyone to please, it withers so, Having no heart to put aside the theft.  And turn again to what it started as, A joyous shot at how things ought to be, Long fallen wide. You can see how it was: Look at the pictures and the cutlery. The music in the piano stool. That vase.   sometimes i get the feeling that nothing is as it ought to be...that the whole world is spinning hopelessly out of control and that we can do nothing but hope for the best.  this, however, is likely untrue.  there are a billion little things to be happy about, and what needs to be done is a whole-hearted embrace of these little things.  last night, during the darkest hours, i woke up to excruciating pain on my arms.  turns out my cat, lovely as she is, had been walking on me in my sleep, and, having stepped too carelessly, slipped off my body and my bed and was holding onto my flesh to break her fall with the sharp, dangerous tips of her claws.  it hurt like hell.  i really have nothing to say today.  i think maybe i am running out of juice... or maybe it is because it is simply too hot outside to think anymore.  or maybe things have become so uninteresting that there is nothing to report.  or maybe, even more likely, i have grown completely uninteresting.  see, the problem is that i don't talk all that much.  i am not a great conversationalist.  i don't get all worked up to talk to people.  instead, i prefer quiet.  i don't find myself aching for conversation, and i find particularly chatty people to be a wee bit irritating at times.  that's not to say that i don't talk at all, because i do talk when i have something to say.  see, that's the point, when there is nothing to say, i don't feel like filling up the void with mindless chit-chat.  i'd rather just take some time to be quiet.  to listen to the birds chirp, or something.  to look at something i hadn't noticed before and see something amazing.
