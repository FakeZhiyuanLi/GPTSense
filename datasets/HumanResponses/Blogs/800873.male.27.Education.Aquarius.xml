      I used to have a blog on blogspot through Blogger, but the template was boring and there was much to be desired in their service. But Blogger is back, and under Google, they have made many new changes. I love the new templates and cvommenting among many other new changes. I am also able to have it under my domain, so thats always a good thing. More to come later.

      I'm still alive, just busy with Caminos. Sorry I haven't updated in a while, but I'll be back to blogging soon. Two weeks left and I'll get to have a normal summer. Can't wait. I have another blog  urlLink HERE  but I wrote more for this one, in case you need something to read. That's is all for now.

      It's been awhile since my last blog, because I moved into the dorms at Texas State University as am RA to the Caminos program. It's a lot different than it was at the high school, more walking and especially because of the hills, ut it's been cool, food's alright at the dining hall and everything. I have some journa; entries starting from Sunday when I moved in, but I only have 5 more minutes to be at the library over here before I have to take the students I have with me back. I already miss my regular life, especially since I have no contact with anyone else since were busy with back to back activities and classes. Anyway, looks like thats it for me today, hopefully I'll be back tomorrow.

      Too tired tooo think or write, but I wanted something new on my blog. Today was a tiring day, but I might go out a lil later with some of the guys that have been helping with our leadership sessions at Caminos. For more on them, check out  urlLink Silicon Valley Debug .   That's their group and the magazine they put out. They've done wonders with our kids this week.

      Today was our second day at Caminos. Caminos is the summer "camp" I'm working at. I put quotes around camp, because it's not a normal type of camp. It's for next year's ninth-graders and they are all at-risk kids. They come to the local high school at around 7:30 a.m., check in, eat lunch and then they start a math problem solving session where they break up into five tables, allthough they are all working on the same thing and from the same teacher.  After that, we break them up into groups of five for Leadership activities. Another facilitator and I work with a group of 12 and work on some fun leadership activities and games. We spend about an hour and a half on that before we go to lunch.  Then we get back up into our core four groups. I get them together and walk them to technology/multimedia class and sit and monitor them for 50 minutes, then to World Geography, Algebra and English at the end of the day before they go home.  It's from 7:30 to 5 p.m. for the first two weeks at the high school before we move to the university (Texas State University). We'll be staying in the dorms with them, so when we're not sleeping we'll be working with the kids.  It's a great program for the kids, and just now after the second day, it's quite an experience and some fun along the way.  Well, cant type forever, gotta be back there at 7:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, so I guess that's it for today.

      It's been awhile, but I just thought I'd let everyone know I'm finallly here in San Antonio on my second week of vacation. It's been fun adn I've enjoyed spending time with my family.   I haven't dpne too much yet, but it'll probably get a lil busier next week. Anyway, I'll write more and recap when I get back home to San Marcos.

       Yet another of my newest desktops. I designed this one when I found out the Spurs signed Brent Barry. I used a picture of him in last year's Sonics uniform and since he shares the number 31, I used Malik Rose's jersey and Bruce Bowen's shorts to give him his new Spurs uniform, especially since he has not officially been introduced or photographed as a Spur. His jersey number may change bc Malik has been there longer, but you never know.   urlLink

      This is my newest graphic creation. I decided I wanted to make a retro Michael Jordan wall and try out some grunge brushes at the same time so I came up with this. It's not exactly what I wanted, but I still like it. BTW, the summer program I had been workjing for six weeks ended yesterday. I'll miss the kids and it was sad t see them go, but I've beeen waiting to have my life back. I should be going down to San Antonio by Wednesday and that's where I'll be for most of the rest of the summer.   urlLink
