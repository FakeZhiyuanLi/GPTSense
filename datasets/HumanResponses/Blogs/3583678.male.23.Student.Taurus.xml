      Choices, like a butterfly’s wing-   I have family members in a side business that has me in fear of financial ruin, legal repercussions but most of all putting the golden calf up as a goal and doing all this in the name of GOD. False prophets will take you in and change you from within. Unless you hold onto God's will, God's purpose for you, and the whole of your trust and love inside you, evil can creep in and make you push God aside. He never leaves his children but earthly commitments can step between you and God. You may say God has abandoned you. No. God is there in the shadows of free choice and if you choose to bring him close into the light in the name of Jesus, you are held in his peace and love and stepped away from yesterday. Choices are what comes between you and God or can bring you forth together to make a gentler earth.   Life is just a journey onto the final destination, heaven. I want to put this aside for a moment. Today you have choices to make that will be cruel or kind hurt nature or protects it, be honest or lie, swindle you neighbor or help them. So many choices, as it is said, 24-7. Just as the butterfly's wing can impact the world, what do all the choices we make impact the world, the people, nature, advancements in care of all of these and more. "His eye is on the sparrow so I know he watches me" I would venture to say a sparrow has few choices in this world. God lays down before it the things it needs, food, trees, flight, and ultimately death. There has to be fear in there but not hatred, has a parental instinct to care for the young until they too can be in the world, they have a song to sing and they use it no matter what the other birds, people, animals, think of it. They do not judge, scorn or hold grudges. They live today.     We are much more complicated than a sparrow. Our behaviors and feelings not only impact the backyard but also have a choice in every thing. Each choice has an influence on everybody in the world. Scenario: A man has a very important appointment, haven't made good choices with his time, make the choice to speed so he don't be looked upon for his poor use of time. His choice will impact on so many levels. Some of them we hear, "Why did God let this happen?” "Was it supposed to be this way?" "What happened was not deserved, was it?" And the question remains, which is at fault. Of course we would "Blame the speeding driver". But what influenced his being late? We don't know. Maybe his electricity was turned off for lack or money. Could the weather have influenced it? We do not know nor can we judge why his time was "miss-managed". Why was the appointment so important? Going to a dying friend or family, late because the appointment was so hard to face, job interview to pay for the electricity, a friend was in need before making a serious mistake, who knows? There is no beginning to a tragedy and no end on the influence it makes on the world. The only way it is made better is by trusting God, not judging others and ultimately, saying "Thy will be done" looking to our father who loves us. A father that finds us so important and so loved that he not only gave as a rainbow as his promise to not harm us but also gave his son to save us. Not just help us, not just to be an example, not to just teach us, but also to take all the sorrow and pain the choices bring to the countless men and women.  If the chain of events is stopped by one person trusting God to provide the right choice, that is, one that is not self-centered and self-serving but God centered and God serving, as small as a butterfly's wing, can change the world.

      Well, I suppose I can put of finding the perfect companion for a little bit longer and hold off on the getting rich part as well.  It's pretty much official.  I've been accepted to the ISU Graduate school program.  I was already accepted to the Human Computer Interaction degree program.  I have my access number to register for classes, and they have a desk reserved.  I'm going to get my master's degree!  The more I think about it, the more excited and scared I feel at the same time.  I might talk a bit more about my research and project work later on.  But for now, back to the grinding stone.

      Well, this week marks the first time in many months that I attended every Hapkido practice.  To say the least, it feels great to be back, although I've lost a great deal of stamina since I started my extended break.  It feels good to be working with the club again though.  All of the ranks are doing excellent and they provide the motivation and excitement to want to go back night after night.  Now, I would have preferred having another week to get back into the swing of things before having to demonstrate a technique in front of everybody.  But, then again, Master Pak has the keen sense of knowing when and how to push somebody.  To say the least, the first attempt wasn't "Black Belt" quality.  It was more or less, "Rusty Black Belt been back for 3 practices" quality.  It took maybe 2 or 3 throws before it clicked.  But, it's almost like riding a bike.  Once you learn it, you don't forget it (at least for a very long time).   Check out the  urlLink club website here .  If you live in Ames, please stop by some time and give it a try or watch a practice.  If you have the strange desire to try and make your body do things you'd never think possible, then I think you might like it.  On a side note, most "Hapkido" schools and clubs don't study the same style as we do.  The vast majority of American Hapkido schools are actually much closer to Karate and Taekwondo.  The style we practice is much closer to Judo without the wrestling around.

      There you have it.  The first and foremost reason to start a blog.  So you can be guaranteed first post.  But, that's not the main reason I have decided to start a blog.  I was just stumbling around Google's website when I noticed they had a blogging service.  Since I recently acquired my very own gmail account, I decided, what the hell.  I might as well have a Google blog as well.  I'll try and remember to post random thoughts up here.
