I got a 92.3 with the 20 points extra. if only i had gottten thirty!!! but it brought my grade up alot. lit was so so. could a been worse.

I'll hafta pick it up next year. my rank is prolly gonna go down 2. whatever. 1 more exam to go in driver's ed yeahhh. come to think of it i should have taken my geometry exam, could have gotten an A. oh well.

      2 days left with 3 exams to go. Chemistry and lit to go, my hardest ones and i dunno what to study for em. I Hope i paid attetion cause' i need an 80 on my chemistry exam for it not to harm me, but i do get 20 extra points from the SOL so a 60 is what i need to do not to hurt myself but with a 100 i get like an 87 average which is a B so i wouldn't have a C grade for the semester. I went to Dolores house to say goodbye but she wasn't there, she's going back to Estonia. cry cry. i made her a cd with american music cookies and muffins. great present huh? well i should study or i will fail. bye y'all.

      Saw the Village and yes i was a tad dissapointed. I just well expected more and well i wasn't as freaked out as i wanted to be. But overall i think it was a decent film, better than the crap that is out there.  Well that was 2night. Behind the wheel as easy, highway driving. just put it on a cruise and change course now and then. Then when the other guy went I slept quite well. Then xc camp was fun. Did the frisbee golf course and played ultimate firsbee, and hyperextented my wrist. still sore. oh well.

      OK. it is not worth the $0.75 i spent on it when looking at the plot and mere content of it. BUT!! If you love laughing at horrible HORRIBLE movies and hate teen cliches, or cliches PERIOD!! Then you'll love it. It' so horrible you must laugh it.&nbsp; I mean do a commentary during the movie with a friend and predict what they're going to say or do, and 99.9 % of the time you will be correct!! I am going to buy this DVD. just for it's sheer horridness. it was worse than Hidalgo.

      so it's 12:23 I WOKE up about 23 mins ago. clock said it was 1, that's why i woke up, but it was wrong. SO NY was great. I mean if i did plays there i could seriously live there. It's always busy. FAST. i hate slow. Always stuff to do. Sops everywhere. AND BROADWAY SHOWS OF COURSE!! I mean i was out with my family till like 12 am every night imagine what me and my friends could do!! jq and jenn!! muahaha. just gimme some pixie sticks. Chicago was GREAT!! Paige Davis from trading spaces was Roxie, she was suprisingly good, altho i do think she laughed 2 much. And Heritage's Mr. Cellophane was way better!!! The lights and the sound were awesome i mean i always heard them ALL clearly. The seats sorta sucked, they were to the side, but i still saw everything just fine. I was practically wording every song and their lines. Sad how i still know that crap from sming (stage managing) it in MARCH. arg. well i do believe i am going home 2 day so when i am home i will blog and then go out!!! I missed my friends so i am determined to go out EVERY night this week. so u be my friend reading this CALL ME with something to do and i'm gonna do it.

      Seriosuly all i wanted today was to be left alone in my room just doing stuff like tv, reading, etc. I just didn't want to interact socially, AT ALL!! BUT no. no no no no no. (if u know Chicago then where is that one from!!?) My parenst practically forced me out to the movies, by myself. That's another reason i didn't want to go. I mean they gave me a like 30 minute warning. I think they just wanted some alone time or something. I really don't know. But seriously who goes to a movie alone?? I mean it was a decent movie cause i'm into Sci-fi to a point (it was Chronicles of Riddick by the way). And every1 is away that i would usually call to go out and crap. Kat no anser, jq n GA, jenn in some college. And every1 else sorry i didn't call BUT i mean i didn't want to be rude and call you without that much notice cause those three ppl i really don't care what they think so i would'y feel awkward asking them. But maybe enxt time i'll think of you, i was clouded by anger and my antisocial mood. Yeah so there's that.      Dad is back 2day, picked him up. Ummmm, they finally did a commerical about Farscape the Peacekeeper Wars on Sci-Fi.  can't wait till that comes in October. I'm leaving tuesday for NY. We're staying two days there now AND we're going to virignia beach and maryland. MY dad can be awesome, sometimes. I'm still a teenager and entitled to really dislike my parents. I know im rambling but i'll keep on going. MUAHA.      Steph was gone 2day and i never really realized how i know her the best OUT OF THE ENTIRE YOUTH GROUP!!  Cause i was there 2day and it was like freaky w/o her cause she's always there and stuff. So yeah Steph sadly enuff (hehe) you're important.  AND I CALLED YOU TODAY. and you weren't answering. so you better of checked your voicemail.     so i am out of things to write. my last post for a while will be 2morrow. but hey it's New york they gotta have cyber cafe's right? If neone from NY reads it e-mail me if they do and where. yeah right some1 from NY is gonna read this long post. AND a pat on the back for me. this is my longest post EVER!! au revoir.     man i had a bad french teacher.

      SO went to church 2day and all. Ran the projection system. WAY WAY easy. altho i did screw up once or twice. but otherwise easy. Youth group was awesome 2 day. SHERRY WAS BACK. and if u don't know sherry is the biggest kid altho she is sorta an adult in our group. she's been gone 2 long. ummmmmmmmmmm. went back to practice 2day for puppets. got nothing done as usual. altho i did have some wonderful cake. wow that was good. dad went to crystal river in FL 2day. HE LET ME DRIVE HIM THERE TO THE AIRPORT I MEAN!! and so i actually drove by my self. And it was fun. I went fast round curves that was kewl. BUT after that i was home alone till like 9'o clock so i watched some DVD"S and got work done. so a somewhat boring day but not really. swam by myself, and yeah it's more fun than with people.

      I hate lawnmowers. I really really do. And I hate it more when my parents force me to do. It's so stupid. The yard looked fine but no, we had to do some medial things that supposedly make the lawn look better. My dad Edward scissorhands practically killed the shrubs. I will own an apartment when I move out, so much easier.

      caution, this post really just sucks.  Yeah pathetic post i kno, but well I am. All my friends from church left 4 camp 2day and well i hang out with em' alot and well i have my driver's thingy all week and well here I am.  They left this afternoon about 2, i stayed until they left. It was depressing. Parents were being jerks about me staying there to say goodbye, well whatever. So it's only a week so I'll see em' Saturday and all, but i'm gonna miss out on all the fun and jokes when they get back. but i'm close with em and all and i'm missing out just cause of some stupid test. uhh. im stopping this b4 i whine more/
