      I was playing Goldeneye 007 the other day and I completed three levels on 00agent, it was hard but no da I mean that's why it's called 00AGENT, anyway I also played poke'mon with my little sister and she's has a really strong poke'mon but I said she needs to train all her poke'mon and not just one but we are going to have an all out battle some day and then we'll see who's the best.

      You know what's funny? The other day I was on my bike and this guy pulls to the WRONG SIDE OF THE RODE!!! And than he starts talking to his friend, I was like "what the heck" what is he doing? Well luckily there was no one coming except me but I wasn't in a car so I didn't hit him but oh I sure wanted to. But oh well some one will hit him some day.

      I was out on my bike the other day behind the building and I felt like I was going to die I was so tired I thought I was out there for like an hour but when I got in it had only been 30 minutes. I was like oh my gosh only 30 minutes. So I sat down on the char and I played driver 2 for an hour I was like what the heck! I thought it had only been ten minutes. But I was still tired, so you know what I did?...I played some more driver 2.

      I haven't been on my blog lately but anyway, I was playing go fish on the internet and I met these kids who sed they're Christians but they didn't act like they were Christians, one of them said "oh well my mom MAKES me go to church every Sunday", and they sed they didn't care about being a Christian, it was like they were to good for god or something, I didn't know what to say, and later I was thinking I was going to be mad at them for not wanting to be a Christian, but I was sad, sad that they would say that about being a Christian, after I left you know what I did? I prayed for them, I prayed that god would open their eyes and that god would Chang what they think about him, so if you read this blog please pray for them, please pray that god would help them. thank you

      So I'm at my little sister's b-day party and two of my friends also came, so I'm playing catch with one of my friends and somehow this little 2nd grader get the ball so I go over to her and grab it...She kicks me in the balls...Luckily there was water that slowed the kick down(so it wouldn't hurt as much) so I let go...And after some healing I went to her and grab it again(and you're thinkin "this guy is so stupid" well if I wasn't this story wouldn't be funny) so she bites my hand, well this time I didn't let go so I RIPPED it from her then I looked at her...And went over and played some more catch with my friend and telling what just happened.
