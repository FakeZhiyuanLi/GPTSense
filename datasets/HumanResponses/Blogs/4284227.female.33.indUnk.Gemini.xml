      I can't stop thinking about you. I even talk to mum about you and that's pretty crazy cos she doesn't really want to know. It's nothing personal, she just has this amazing self defence mechanism which protects her from the pain and the hurting that thinking about her past would cause. How anyone can erase their past from their memory without the help of hypnotherapy or some other medium is beyond me. I think it makes her quite cold as a person and sometimes I really loathe her, she can be so hurtful. I know all mothers say hurtful things at times, especially to their children, but she has this real knack of making you feel so useless, thoughtless and generally not a very nice person. I have tried to harden myself against her comments and snide remarks, I ignore it when she criticizes my parenting skills and try not to take it to heart when she starts having a go at me just because she's had a drink, but it's really impossible. You know, when I told her I was pregnant, she didn't speak to me for 5 months. I was 31yrs old for gods sake, ok so I hadn't known the father for very long, but hey shit happens, I thought it was a miracle. I truly believed that I couldn't have kids. After so many years of unprotected sex with no accidents, to fall pregnant when I did was really amazing. I'm so lucky, I have a beautiful little girl who makes me laugh and cry all at the same time. I didn't think it was possible to feel such pride and love for someone. She is my reason for living! I hope i'm not such an ogre to her as mum is to me. God it really sounds awful that i'm saying these things about mum, I love her dearly and so much want her to be happy and proud. I want her to have everything that you should have given her and more. She has been really great about some stuff, like when I sold up and went to meet your brother and widow in the states for 3 months. I called her most days while we were there, of course, and she was genuinely happy that I had finally found you even though you'd been dead for a whole year. Life can be so unkind, so easy to find a dead person on the net but it was impossible to find you before that. I started to look for you when I was 16, I had run away from home after another row with mum. We were in London visiting my step-dad at the time so it was easy for me, I just jumped on a tube into Central London. I remember it as if it were yesterday, it was a Sunday and I was sitting on a bench on Victoria Street in Victoria. I didn't have a clue what to do or where I was going to go but I wasn't scared or nervous, just apprehensive and even a bit excited. These two foreign guys came up to me and asked me what I was doing, I told them that I had nowhere to stay so they said I could stay with them in White City. As crazy and naive as it sounds, I went. I ended up staying there for just 4 nights because they started getting a bit touchy feely with me. I guess I was lucky really, they didn't hurt me or anything, they just tried it on a bit. I am grateful to them for being so nice to me though, there's not many people who would take in a stranger into their home. I found a place to sleep in a Centrepoint Nightshelter on Shaftesbury Avenue. It was more luck than judgement I can tell you. The Nightshelter was just round the corner from Chinatown where there was a Library. I used to go in the Library to search through the US phone books for listings with your surname. There were hundreds and hundreds of them. I didn't have a clue where to start so I copied the details of all that I found with your initial. I still have some of them somewhere. I really wish we could have got to know eachother, I feel so cheated. It was so unfair of you to move to the USA without me, I know that I was with mum but you could have at least kept in touch so I could have visited you, spoken to you on the phone, known you. I have no memories of the last time I saw you. Mum told me about how you were supposed to meet us around Christmas time 1975 and that you couldn't make it because of the snow. What happened after that? According to your passport, which Lora gave me while we were visiting in May this year, you emigrated to the States in Spring of 1977, what were you doing for that year? Why did you stay away from me? I'd like to believe in mediums and clairvoyance so that maybe one day you'll be able to give me the answers to all of the many questions I have for you. Anyway, time to go. Love You Always and Wish You Were Here,  Sharon xxx
