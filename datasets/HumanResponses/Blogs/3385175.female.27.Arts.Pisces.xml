      ...I love you not for whom you are, but who I am when I'm by your side ...No person deserves your tears, and who deserves them won't make you cry ...Just because someone doesn't love as you wish, it does not mean  you're not loved with all his being ...a true friend is the one who holds your hand and touches your heart ...the worst way to miss someone is to be seated by his side and  know you'll never have him ...Never stop smiling, not even when you're sad, someone might fall in love with your smile ...You may only be a person in this world, but for someone, you are the world ...Don't spend time with someone who doesn't care spending it with you ...Maybe God wants you to meet many wrong people before you meet the  right one, so when this happens, you'll be thankfull ...Don't cry because it came to an end. Smile because it happened ...There will be always people who'll hurt you, so you need to continue trusting, just be careful ...Become a better person and be sure to know who you are before meeting someone new and hoping that person knows who you are ...Don't struggle so much, best things happen when not expected  Always remember that: "Everything that happens has a reason behind"   ***forward from a friend - 13 phrases for living***

      I never knew lonely and now I know you from my heart You give me reason You don't even know me and you rushed into my life So easily  Do you know that place between sleep and awake where you remember all your dreams  That's where I'll always love you That's where I'll always watch you Hoping that one day  So many nights I've been waiting for your smile   So beautiful I slide into darkness and you stand in the light Like an angel   Do you know that place between sleep and awake  where you remember all your dreams That's where I'll always love you  That's where I'll always watch you Hoping one day you'll Feel my love Like the rain that wets your skin Like a sail that hits the wind Feel my love Like the wind that climbs the trees Like the smell of summerbreeze I feel you   If you can listen just listen to my heart So silently I'm cold and I'm lonely guess I'll wait another while The pain of letting go  Do you know that place between sleep and awake Where you remember all your dreams That's where I'll always love you That's where I'll always watch you Hoping one day you'll Feel my love Like the rain that wets your skin Like a sail that hits the wind Feel my love Like the flower needs the rain Like the child that cries your name Feel my love Like the wind that climbs the trees Like the smell of summerbreeze I feel you  FEEL MY LOVE by TEN SHARP

      Wise words from a wise friend of mine:   "Terkadang kalimat akan terasa lebih bermakna bila diucapkan sebaliknya...."   And I totally agree... Coz sometimes....  'Hate'  could be  'Love' 'Happy'  could be  'Sad' 'Find'  could be  'Hurt'   Only the real friend could understand you most.... Only the real friend could see the truth in your eyes... Only the real friend could feel your sorrow...and happiness...

      If you need somebody to love, Just look into my eyes I’ll be there to make you feel right... If you’re feeling sorry and sad, I’d really sympathize Don’t be sad, just call me tonight...  Anytime at all Anytime at all Anytime at al All you’ve gotta do is call And I’ll be there...  If the sun has faded away, I’ll try to make it shine There is nothing I won’t do... If you need a shoulder to cry, I hope it will be mine Call me tonight and I’ll come to you...  Anytime at all Anytime at all Anytime at all All you’ve gotta do is call And I’ll be there...  Anytime at all Anytime at all Anytime at all All you’ve gotta do is call And I’ll be there...  Anytime at all All you’ve gotta do is call And I’ll be there...   - Any Time at All > Lennon/McCartney -

      ... Never ever falling in love with a girl like me Never ever feeling that I’m some kinds of extra ordinary Never ever care about what I feel inside Never ever listen to the word I said Never ever asking how’s my day Never ever call just to say hello Never ever find out the truth about me Never ever think that I’m beautiful Never ever give me a thousand compliments One more time I’m telling you to...Never ever!!  --My Great Expectation (falling into you)--
