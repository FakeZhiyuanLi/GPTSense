      Blink 182 - I Miss You [printing version]  Hello there, the angel from my nightmare the shadow in the background of the morgue the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley we can live like Jack and Sally if we want where you can always find me we'll have Halloween on Christmas and in the night we'll wish this never ends we'll wish this never ends  (I miss you, miss you) (I miss you, miss you)  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always this sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting every time and as I stared I counted webs from all the spiders catching things and eating their insides like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason will you come home and stop this pain tonight stop this pain tonight  Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  (I miss you, miss you) (I miss you, miss you) (I miss you, miss you) (I miss you, miss you)

      Eminem - Cleanin Out My Closet [printing version]  Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'... Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin', tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama, i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...  [CHORUS]  I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...  I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye, no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...  [CHORUS]  Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen for you think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin' your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

      Linkin Park - Crawling [printing version]  Crawling in my skin These wounds they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface Consuming, confusing This lack of self control I fear is never ending Controlling, I can't seem To find myself again My walls are closing in (Without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced That it's just too much pressure to take) I've felt this way before So insecure Crawling in my skin These wounds they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me Distracting/Reacting Against my will I stand beside my own reflection It's haunting how I can't seem... To find myself again My walls are closing in (Without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced That it's just too much pressure to take) I've felt this way before So insecure Crawling in my skin These wounds they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real

      "My Happy Ending"  So much for my happy ending Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead Was it something I did? Was it something You said? Don't leave me hanging In a city so dead Held up so high  On such a breakable thread  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  [Chorus:] You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  You've got your dumb friends I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  [Chorus]  It's nice to know that you were there Thanks for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one It's nice to know we had it all Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done  [Chorus x2]  [x2] Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh... So much for my happy ending  Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
