      Contrary to public belief, the highest divorce rate found anywhere in the world is right here, in the U.S. Army. Every Saturday I read the "Army Times" Newspaper of how one spouse has shot or killed the other because of infidelity on their behalf, and I am afraid that there is alot to be said about the issue. For example, my husband is in Iraq.  I have a newborn-baby and no support, whatsoever, if my car breaks down, who's gonna help me ? If I need some lovin', who's gonna give it to me ?  If I need my partner and I can't have him for the next 365 days - what am I going to do ?  Find another one ? No.  But believe me, there are women who have been married far longer than me, have far more children than me, have spent lots more time with their husbands than I have, and STILL crave the MALE attention and are willing to cheat on their husbands to get it !!! Never mind the fact that they are stay at home wives spending their husbands paychecks and then cheating on them.  Isn't that sad ? Your man is dodging landmines to keep his butt safe and you're at home spending his money and having a good ol' romp in the sheets with some stranger to "give you the tenderness you desire".  C'mon now !  But then again, it works both ways, in Qatar, Iraq, soldiers are allowed to have 4 days of sun, hotel, playstation 2, and of course access to unlimtied amounts of alcohol and sex. (Prostitutes).  And each soldier who is in Iraq gets a 4-day pass to go to Qatar and "rest and relax".  Two soldiers have already come back to work with HIV and, excuse me, but this is like giving catnip to a cat.  any comments ?

      Well, other than the usual run of the mill, which normally keeps me busy all day, anyway.... I have had a few molehills to deal with lately. 1.  Cannot get an interview to even apply for a u.s. holiday visa until 16th june. 2.  Had wisdom tooth taken out. 3.  Car dead. 4.  been diagnosed with bilateral carpel tunnel syndrome in both hands - not allowed to like, do anything !!!! 5.  Having all other wisdom teeth taken out in 2 weeks. 6.  No one to help me  I hate life.  I'll let you know when I'm over this phase...

      This week,on the news, Iraqi's lashed out against the American Abu-Ghraib Prison abuse.  They kidnapped a civillian male, one Nick Berg, and videotaped decapitating him.  The video was sent to the Pentagon and posted on the internet.  It was shown on national T.V. in the states and is accessible on the web.  Now, my gripe is, who broadcasts such a thing to a bunch of Army wives whose husbands are deployed in the very same region ? I swear, these bloody people have no tact.  Feedback anyone ? Bring it on ! P.S. if this doesn't make sense, it's because I just had my wisdom tooth pulled.

      This month the little (or should I say not-so-little) prince weighs in at 6.5 kgs at the age of 2 1/2 months. Accomplishments so far include : smiles to melt even the hardest of hearts, clear vision, irritating the living hell out of mom between 5 & 8 pm (the naggy, tired, bored, entertain me constantly part of the day), grasping lightly onto rattles, lifting his head by himself while on his tummy, and notedly, lifting his upper body while on his tummy too.  Not too shabby for a two month old, eh ?

      Hi everybody, well, anybody who's so bored they'd actually read this site. I'd really like some feedback on whether this is a viable project, so please leave your comments and if this website takes off, you'll be learning alot about Germany and U.S. army life as well as american culture.

      o.k. So like, today was only THE best day I have had since Fred left !  I got a box from one of the soldiers who has come home on R 'n R.  It had the dictaphone and photos of Fred in it.  I have been on cloud 9 all day looking at photos of my man and listening to his voice on a 30 minute tape.  I swear it was like christmas all over again !!

      Wow, what a cool Fest. I will post photos soon. They had a special Volksfest Brew, of course I had one.  They don't serve anything under a pint, so I had to have the whole pint (of course, can't let DAMN good beer go to waste !), and after that my head was spinning, so I went home !!!  I mean, it was only 7 pm and I had that woozy tired feeling !  Plus I was going to be having visitors at 9 pm, so I had to put the baby to bed and get ready for cocktail night.  We drank peach nectar (dahling!) with champagne and ate pizza.  It was great.  My guests are friends of mine who are german and live here in Schweinfurt.  We ate, drank and played Yatsi.  Perfect weekend entertainment for me !  I hope that you will be able to see the photos when Nats finishes helping me.  This photoblog thing seems to be beyond my brain.

      run for your life.  I'm in teething hell. Now, this is something I definitely wouldn't wish upon my very worst enemy.  You know how your gums feel when your wisdom teeth came out ?  Well, now imagine that feeling, but being experienced by a baby, 30 times. I'll leave you with that thought. Hope you AT least have a good weekend :)

      Well, I'm just so angry right now. Those of you who know me, know that I like things black or white.  Save the grey areas for someone else. I had such a lousy time today.   Anyone who knows anything about applying for a visa, will know that even though you MAY THINK that you have all your ducks in a row, one of them is still gonna come up to you and bite you in the ass. Today, I drove 200km on the Autobahn with a teething baby in tow, just to get to the consulate and wait outside for hours, when I had booked an appointment (@ $2.00 per minute on the telephone).  10h30 turned into 16h30.  Then, they couldn't find my name on the list, then they sent me back to my car to drop off my cellphone (2km walk), because they didn't allow cellphones in the building (they forgot to tell me on the expensive call - i dunno, maybe they thought they would save me money :( ) and then.....waited 2 hours in queues just to get a 5 minute interview, where they didn't even bother to look at mission-accomplished-over-several-weeks-of-bloodsweatand tears-paperwork !!!! The system SSSSSSUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKSSSSSSSSS!!! Care to share your experiences ?

      Yeah, so it was like, only the longest weekend of my LIFE.  Having an open eound on a long weekend is no fun. I do not recommend it. But, one thing that is cool, is the Schweinfurter Volksfest opened this weekend, so in order to cheat the crowds, I've decided to go next weekend, where I will douse myself in german beer and Bratwurst with lekker German mustard (only the best in the world!) and experience some good vibes for a change !

      Yep, well, I got home from the hospital yesterday, only to find that Hugo wouldn’t even look at me with his left butt cheek he was so pissed at me for handing him out to my friends for the last few days.  He then proceeded to cry the whole day as if ‘to get me back or something’.  That was truly the pits, but it is the truth.  I stay at home with him everyday and monitor his behavioural patterns, and I’m sorry to say, it’s true, he was largely affected by the whole change in routine, even at a mere 3.5 months of age !! I’m at a crossroads as to what I am going to study.  I have an opportunity to study through the army for 50% of the price, and I don’t know whether I am going to study Journ. or Child Psych, but I’ll let you know when I reach a verdict.  I’m thinking of soing a degree in Psychology with credits in children’s sociology and broadcasting.

      Well, in one fell swoop of a two hour period on Wednesday, I had visited my doctor, an emergency room, handed Hugo over to a friend and landed up in hospital under general anaesthesia ! It all happened so suddenly, I didn't even get a chance to call anyone or make sure that Hugo was o.k. - with a friend I trust - sort of. I just got home half and hour ago and am still reeling in shock of the whole thing.   Anyone want to share their general anaesthesia experiences, lets see if anyone had the same as I. It was so wierd ! They wheeled me down to get put to sleep, right and as they wheel me in, they're busy brnging someone else round ! In exactly the same room, so you hear this guy shouting and freaking out in German, it was so scary, especially since this was my first time And then of course it was a German hospital, so the nurses and doctors are telling you what to do, like turn around, roll over etc, when you're all drugged up and it is such a freaky experience, because at first you think you've been captured by aliens, but then you realise that someone's screaming german in your ear !

      Imagine driving around every day, and seeing the south african flag waving on everyone's doorstep. Is it that we don't love our country enough ? Or is it just that the americans are cheesy to have their flags waving on their doorsteps ? I'd like to hold a poll on your answers, so please, everyone who reads this post, leave a comment.

      Schweinfurt is considered to be a small town.  I, having come from a small town, consider this to be a rather large town, with lots of great things to do and places to go.  There are many Schwimmbaden (Indoor swimming pools). there is also a zoo, the Stadtmitte (city centre) caters for all my clothes-shopping needs (not that I FIT INTO ANYTHING being post-maternity and all - nine months in, nine months out  - that’s what I keep telling myself, anyway :p ), beautiful surrounding villages with quaint castles and country roads, the autobahn (yeah, baby) and Bratwurst (yum) !  Don’t mind me not talking about the chocolate - I’m currently doing the Dr.  P:hil ultimate weightloss challenge, whereby he has instructed me not to think about those foods which are sinful to me, that food, in my case is C-H-O-C-O-L-A-T-E. So there are a lot of things to do ! Schweinfurt is also popular for it’s shade of green paint, invented here, which was a trend in house painting in the previous century.  Myth has it that this paint, manufactured in Schweinfurt, called ‘Schweinfurter Grün‘, was actually taken off of the market after a few years, having been found to be laced with cyanide (these Germans are a bunch of freaks).

      well, the newest on my side is....  Fred isn't coming on 2 week r 'n r until at least October, so I am home free to depart for S.A. by the 27th of August. Hugo is 5 months old, and will be sitting up on his own in another month or so, and is a much happier chappy since he discovered his toes and how nice they taste. I am proud to say that he is already standing up on his little toes and is getting very good at it !! We have bought some more furniture and our place isn't looking as sterile as it has been looking for the last 8 months. P.S. be on the look out, I might be coming home sooner !!!

      Hey, has it ever happened to you, that you're driving 120km/h on the freeway and you have this huge mother-orgasmic sneeze, and you know that if you let it out you're going to have to close your eyes...and then you realise just before you explode mucuous you realise that you are going to have to close your eyes on this biggie and perhaps crash into the car in front of you ? Don't you hate it when that happens ???

      I am having such fun.  Fred has a big bakkie (truck in american) and I get to cruise around here on dirt roads all day long !! It's awesome.  Fred's dad also has those four-wheeler deals so we're going to put batteries in them tomorrow and go riding in the forest.  Yay.  O.k. can't write anymore, I'm having too much fun.  Bye !!!

      Well, gone are the days of little peace and quiet.   Guess I thought it would get easier when Hugo got older, but he is getting to be so mobile, you have to watch his every move !! He rolls himself over onto his stomach and then can't roll back, so gone are the days of running into the kitchen quickly to do something !! You have to be by his side for the next 7 months in order to watch that he doesn't fall, or hurt himself unintentionally. WAAAAAAAHHHHHHH ! What a rude awakening...
