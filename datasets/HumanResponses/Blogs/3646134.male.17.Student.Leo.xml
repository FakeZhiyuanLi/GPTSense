      Mood: great :) at Sophia, Jonny B, Aldred, Rachey, Lynne-Marie 8-) at Wilson Listening to: Queens of the stoneage - No one knows  Raar, sorry for the long update!  Been busy busy busy!  It was Fran's b/d last Wed... her party on Thursday!  So we all went there (minus an Ian... he claims due to coursework, I claim it's lieeeees :p) so I was winding him up trying to make him come :p.  So loads of ppl met up in McDonalds in Castle Gardens... but Fran forgot to account for the fact it was the England match!  So we all wanted to go watch it :| planning lol.  In the end we came to a compramise: Rilleys :p play pool and watch the match!  I got a tad tipsy after a few too many pints!  Still managed to win a suprisingly high number of games :p but then Ruth, Sam and Jamie left... which soured the mood a tad... they all went to get pizza and get the bus!  I mean Fran's ment to be like their best friend!  So they leave half way thru her party to go home!!  So she was far from impressed :s and then England lost so we all left.  Fran offered me a lift with her mum... who was there within 5 mins :| (West Cross to town!!  Should take about 15!) still wearing her England shit, I suddenly realised it wasn't a great idea :p was a tad scared lol.  Theeen... Kung Fu... Angi, Hannah, Charlotte and Dai braught down alcohol!  Ooo dear, second night drinking!  Got absolutely plastered and mildly annoyed Angi by drinking her (full) drink when she gave it to me to hold for 2 mins while she went outside for a cigarette :p whoopsie!  Then came home, said many things I shouldn'tve to people online... whoopsie again!  I think I've corrected them all now :s haha  On Saturday... went out shopping :) my mum's birthday, failed to get a pressie but never mind, I'm going into town again twice this week!  Buuuuuuuuuuuut, at random, I gotta txt from Sophia :) aint tlked 2 her in soooooooooooooo long!  We hadda massive txt convo, talked on the fone for about an hour last night and arranged to go for a few pints on Thursday to catch up :) *sigh* been so long!  Ooo and on Friday, I'm meetin up with Rachey and goin to see Shrek 2!  (no-one else wanted to :( miserable buggers!) so we're goin by ourselves!  Ah well, should be good!  I really cant be arsed with college anymore.  Jonny B came into physics half hour late coz his mum's away (we were all over his house yesterday being noisy when his mum rang :p ooo dear :p) and we were really bored... so we mitched the rest of the day, went over his house, teased his kittens, played games and ate angel delight which was most fun!  I have to hand my physics coursework in tomorrow, so I best go do that!  ahh who'm I kidding, I'm going to play TimeSplitters :p

      Mood: Happy! Listening to: Blink 182 - Wasting time :) at Everything  Had a gd few days! finally gettin back to havin fun after exams :D  Not been to any lectures really!  Big n sweaty (our affectionate name for the maths mechanics lecturer, Judith) rang my mum yesterday to say I haven't been going to maths... my mum's response was "Exams are over, sorry Judith... you're just too damn fat!".  Looks like I wont be taking maths next year :| although it was very funny!  Last few days I've been on drugs :p the scary scary things that cure my back pain but make my vision go purple and give me hallucinations! :s  Yes that pink elephant was trying to steal my left leg!  :$ so the back pain's been gone :D but knowing me, I'll twat it over again doing something dull!  :p  My neighbours moved out today, at last!  I've had a bit of a vendetta against them... they kicked my cat once... 7 speakers, a subwoofer and a powerful amp... up against the joining wall till 3 am :) all I can say: Tim wins :D  Today, Jonny B wore kinda stupid (very amusing) shorts!  Whenever he moved too fast, they'd compress his groin!  So Matt was trying to make him move suddenly all day :p so harsh!  And Wilson was doing his manwhore act and ignoring us... so we were throwing things at him, all simultaneously texted him saying "you suck, we hate you!" and slapping him etc until the girl he was trying to impress just laughed and walked off :p (he does hav a g/f!) and then Yumi got offered a lift home and there were no seats left in Jonny B's car... so he was far from impressed lol (but we were happy... she's a really lovely person!  RHCP concert 2moz :p so everyone off to that!  Then planning the beach on Friday!  busy busy busy!  Tim

      Mood: Ill.  Very ill. Listening to: Maroon 5 - She will be loved :) at Rachel and Rhys :@ at flu  Ach, I'm very ill :(.  I thought my flu was going away but I appear to have had a relapse.  Arses.  And because of the antibiotics, I can't take my bloody painkillers!  (I did my back in saving someone's knees a fair while ago... long story!) but it needs an operation... and till then I get some loverly painkillers that stop the bugger hurting.  Buuut im not allowed with these antibiotics or bad things could happen :(.  The doctor gave me different ones... I took one last night, it made my vision go purple and me go insanely hyper and happy :| so I decided I'd stay off them for the sake of my sanity!  Now I have a lovely mix of flu, hayfever and a knackered back!  Woohoo :|  I've been advised what to do with the Katie thing... a load of people were arsing round the subject... the only person who gave me plain advice was Rachel: "Block her".  So I took it lol.  Thankyou darling :) was the rite choice, I just needed it slapped into me :p  Caroline is starting to have a massive spaz-fit on me.  I aint been to electronics in weeks.  hehe.  I better start going, she's developing a glint in her eye like next time the class goes in, they're gonna find me nailed above her door by my testicles.  Went to town with Jonsey today.  The backtwat incident was braught back up so we spent a good 10 mins laughing, and we had a general bitch about everyone we dont like :p haha.  So all in all... a good day with a damn bad illness :|

      Mood: Good if a tad confused Listening to: The streets - such a twat :) at Jonny B, Aldred :| at Wilson :s at Katie Plugs:  urlLink Sarah ,  urlLink  Mari , Ayat, Hannah.  Ok, bad idea.  I'm talking to Katie again :S.  This is my ex g/f.  We were together for a year and it ended veeeeery badly, and we kept falling out etc etc, I blocked, deleted and generally avoided her.  But then she apoligised and we started talking again.  I've been told off by many people.  lol.  Currently she's flirting with me like I'm the last man on earth and she needs to breed with me to ensure the survival of humankind.  Blah.  Why didn't I juuuuuust tell her to leave me alone :s lol.  Now she's phoning me.  Woohoo!  :|  It was a good day though otherwise :D me + Jonny B went to first lecture to do our coursework (like the good little boys we are (A):p ) and after that, thought... hmm... 3 lectures left... can I be bothered?  Nah :D went over Matt's house, spent the day eatting and playing PS2 games, then everyone came back to mine.  Yet again, Wilson decided he could beat everyone at everything.  Then we all kicked his ass and he went off home in a strop :p silly boy!  :p anyway, I'm tired, sleepy time!

      Mood: good Currently listening to: The offspring - the kids aren't alright :) at Ian, Elle :@ at Fran, Ruth  Well they're finally over :D woohoo!  I had physics yesterday which was impossible.  Anti-up quarks?  Measons?  Yes... so I sat in the exam falling asleep and failing quietly in the corner.  Not really caring though, all my exams are finiiiiiished :D mwahaha!  So drove home with Jonny B, he failed as badly as me so I don't feel so bad :p, got home, went on the computer... played counterstrike for a bit, came online... Ian's username: I@n ----{Shit stirring]---- so I was a bit intreagued... as soon as I sign in, I get "omfg!!  You'll never guess what Fran's done!!".  Me + Ian have a long running joke about Ruth being quite childish (which she is) and we were talking about it on Saturday before Ruth's birthday when Fran was in the car.  The party was crap (me, Ian + Kristian just spent it playin rugby and watch people spread Jam over Minty's crotch) and we soon left for the pub!  Nothing more was thought of it... however, then it turns out that Fran had told Ruth that Ian had been saying shit about her!  And on Ruth + Ian's shakey (nasty breakup, lots of arguing) friendship, she went mental!  Told Ian to fuck off etc etc.  I couldn't believe Fran told her to be honest!  It was so nasty, she knew what it'd do!  So I had a go at her when she signed in and she apoligised... but Ruth's still fumming.  Almost as angry as she was when Fran did the same thing when her + Ian split up.  Arg.  Soo, im really rather pissed off with Fran, and Ruth for some of the things she said to Ian!  Raar.

      Listening to: No doubt – Don’t speak Mood: a lil bit tired but not too bad! :) at Siwan, Jonny B, Rhys  Arg I’m sleepy!  Hehe!  Of recent I’ve been very lazy!  Not really gone anyone or done much :p this’ll have to be a quick post as even my normal insomnia’s caught up with me!  Yesterday, I got talking to Siwan online about various things… and somehow we ended up chatting for like 8 hours flat!  I felt like I really got to know her in that time, it was really nice :) I guess we just clicked!    Other things I've been doing... blah, working!  We're slowly eatting more and more complimentary food... getting upto about £5 a morning now!  haha.  And been out today with Rhys and Jonny B, then went back to mine for a bit... no-one's seen Wilson though!  Aparently he's been spending his life with his "girlfriend" (it winds us up that he can't call her by her name... he's just so amazed he has a g/f, he cant help calling her it!)... but no one's heard from him in almost months now!  Ah well, why'm I complaining, it'll be highly amusing when she dumps him to see his strategy of crawling back into our favour... oh wait, he never had our favour, he just liked to follow us round :p  Anyways, I need very large amounts of sleep... the insomnia's worse than ever!  Rarg!  I'm off to attempt sleep now!  nitey night :p

      Mood: tired but happy! Listening to: Counting crows - colourblind :) at Rachel, Sophia, Louo  arg, I need sleep :s 4 days working in a row :( bleh!  Insomnia sucks ass on many levels.  Had a good day on Thursday and Friday!  Thursday I went to meet Sophia (who's on work exp) down Mumbles... she neglected to tell me she's workin in a flower shop!  We wandered down the pub and I had a good laugh at her apron :p she was unimpressed :p but we had a good chat and caught up on everything in the 3 or 4 months I havent spoken to her for!  After her lunch break was over I wandered to town... aparently Ayat saw me :s was probably in a world of my own as usual :p.  Went to find my mum a b/d pressie... ended up in hmv with no ideas at all!  Located a stone roses cd... she likes most of their stuff, infact she has a scary taste in music in general (I literally found her listening to my Maralyn Manson CDs in her car :|).  Friday: I met Rachel :D hehe, we got on really well, she's lovely!  We went for a bit of a wander to Toys r us b4 meeting Ian and grabbing lunch... I got a few strange looks for eatting large amounts of complimentary sugar :$ hehe and went to the cinema :p.  A few people we know were there... bit of a nasty confrontation, Ruth, Chris, Jay and Jo: Ian vs Ruth.  Ouch.  They point blank ignored each other :| Ian talked to Chris, I talked to Ruth about a very stupid thing Fran'd done :p we went to get tickets... aaaaaaand obviously, Chris told us to get tickets for the same time as they were going in.  Last film Ruth and Ian saw together was finding nemo.  Which they spent almost entirely making out.  So I coughed it a few times under my breath and wound Ian up :p hehehe!  Shrek 2 was awsome :D Ian and Ruth sat a long long way from each other still denying each other's existance!  Silly buggers :p.  Ian wanted to go home (mood soured a little by Ruth :s) and Rachel was gonna go too... I'd missed my bus by about 5 mins, so she offered to wait the 55 mins till the next one which was absolutely lovely!  We sat by the entrance to the Quadrent on the grass by the church chattin about anything and everything... time went fast :$ hehe, and (it being my mum's birthday) I had to be home to go out for a meal with my parents.  Blah.  lol.  Had a very good day though :)  My mum's been winding me up a tad recently... well a tad is an understatement :| she's been pissing me right off!  Whinging about everything, critisizing all that I do... raaar.  So I'm locking myself in my room for now :p blasting music at her :D mwahaha  Anyway, I'm off over Jonsey's in a min, probs post more later!
