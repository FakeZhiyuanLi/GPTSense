						   I've decided to set up my own little blog.  Just to get some thoughts and views down where I can see and think about them.  Maybe some book and movie reviews once in a while.  I'll write more tonight.

						   If you haven't seen this video, you've got to see it.&nbsp; Go to  urlLink www.jibjab.com  and click on the picture of Bush/Kerry.&nbsp; It makes fun of both of them but my die-hard republican friend&nbsp;insists that it's typical liberal crap.&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't politics fun?!?!?!?!!&nbsp;

						   It's been a bit hard to get to the keyboard these past few days.&nbsp; Not to mention too hot in my office during the daytime.&nbsp; So, what have I been doing you ask?&nbsp; Working on projects in the basement, looking for a new job and&nbsp;setting things up to go back to school this September to FINALLY get around to finishing up my bachelor's degree.&nbsp; I've also been spending about an hour each evening after it finally cools off on 10 mile bike rides to get my daily exercise.&nbsp; Actually, thats usually the most relaxing part of the day, not to mention the most entertaining.&nbsp; I've seen two fender-benders and a small brush fire in the past week.&nbsp; Speaking of finding a new job, I've finally found one that will fit around my UofIdaho school schedule.&nbsp; Nothing glamourous, but it's income.&nbsp; It's been kind of tight just living off my wife's paycheck and with a new addition to the family due this January, it'll be great to have.&nbsp; Blah, no sense of humor tonight, just too darn hot to do.&nbsp; And speaking of January, I'm looking forward to winter again, scary thought isn't it.&nbsp; Not that shoveling&nbsp;2 feet of snow out of the driveway is fun but it's easier to warm up then it is to cool off around here. Taking a trip this Seattle this weekend.&nbsp; Mom wants to go baby-stuff shopping with my wife, April.&nbsp; I'm thinking they should probably wait until we know what sex the baby's going to be, but hey, mom's paying for it and there is a lot of stuff that comes in gender-neutral colors that won't really matter so I guess I can't argue much.&nbsp;  Note to Cindy-Lou, finally got around to getting my lazy backside to sit down and write.&nbsp; I'll try to be a bit more diligent :D&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp;

						   I tend to collect, read, and watch a lot of the darker fantasies.  Three of my favorite authors include the likes of Ann Rice, Nancy Collins and Ann Bishop.  No I'm not a goth or even a closet goth (I don't fit the skinny tall pale build, sorry) but I do appreciate the style.  And by style I mean the music, the views and the type.  You get what I mean.  Anyway, lets just say I enjoy a good vampire movie or book.  I don't care if the movie is corny and badly written (see: Queen of the Damned), it's still entertaining to watch.  My recent favorite has probably been Underworld, although Bram Stoker's Dracula is probably my all time favorite.  Moving on to other good dark movies and books, take Ann Bishop's The Black Jewels Trilogy (I've seen it at Amazon as one book altogher).  Probably one of best series I've ever read.  Word of advice, if you think Harry Potter is evil and a sign of the devil, you definitely don't want to read these books.  However, for some reason, I don't like dark murder-thrillers.  For example, the movie The Cell was okay, it had it's good parts but it didn't make me want to go out and buy it on DVD (it could be the main actress, you never know).  Silence of the Lambs was a decent movie but for Anthony Hopkins dark-themed-movies, I much perfer the movie Titus from Will Shakespear's Titus Andronicus.  And this movie isn't really one of those murder thriller's either, it's just a good dark movie.  Another favorite movie of mine, the original Crow with Brandon Lee.  (Reminder to self: visit Bruce and Brandon Lee's gravesites next time in Seattle).  That song at the end during the credits "It Can't Rain All The Time" still brings a lump to my throat every time I hear it.

						   Music, music, music.  Heh.  Where to start.  This is just one of those topics no one will ever agree about (including myself with myself, figure that one out).  But this is my blog so I get to have my own opinions so there (add childish diabolical laughter here).  Anyway, I'm one of those people, who instead of having insidious voices running in the back of their heads, have music running in the back of their heads (insidious or not, heh).  But what music do you ask?  Practically pretty much everything thats not Country or post-80's Rap/R&B, that stuff just drives me up a wall.  The only exception to that edict would be Shania Twain (shhhhh, don't tell anyone), she could sing any type of music and I'd probably listen to it.  Also, the reason I say post-80's Rap is the fact that Beastie Boys, the Fresh Prince and Sir Mix-A-Lot were just too dang good not to listen to, not to mention fun (shhhhh, don't tell anyone that either).  As for the music covered under everything else , there's nothing that I won't listen to or try(okay, maybe some teeny bopper crap i.e. Biogenetically engineered boy or girl bands or evil American Idol music, actually I could probably expand on that) (and why am I putting everything in ( ), ?). heh.  And as to some of Brian's favorite bands/groups/music/whatever, I've decided to list a few along with my favorite album (please scroll down now if you don't really give a rats backside :D)  :  Massive Attack/Mezzanine- Great moody grooves.  Trip-hop's about as close to modern rap/R&B as I'll ever get, well, not counting Drum and Bass Techno (Prodigy, that is) anyway. Primus/Pork Soda- Claypool is a bass guitar god.  THE END.  And does anyone else think The Air Is Getting Slippery? Sky Cries Mary/This Timeless Turning-  Beautiful music.  And some great memories to go along with it. Eels/Beautiful Freak- Not many remember this band.  But I've found that everyone needs a little Novicaine For The Soul now and then. The Presidents of the USA/II- Okay, everyone did get a little sick of eating Lumpy Peaches but the second album more than made up for it. Orbital/In Sides- Even I'll admit techno is dead, but Orbital will live forever. Sarah McLachlan/Solace- Yes, she's depressing as hell but she's one great singer. Dead Can Dance/The Serpent's Egg- Lisa Gerrard is another singer to add to that list of incredible voices.

						   It's a sad, sad day in Seattle. The mighty Ed-Gar has retired. With a .312 batting average and 305 homers, Edgar was arguably one of the greatest players Seattle has ever seen. It would be a fitting tribute for Seattle to retire his number and for us to hope that he become the first Designated Hitter to reach the Baseball Hall of Fame.  UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE  As seen on ESPN.com  Former Seattle slugger Jay Buhner and several players turned out to support  urlLink Edgar Martinez  during his retirement announcement Aug. 8, and team chairman Howard Lincoln said his No. 11 would be retired.

						   Has started once again (much to the chagrin of my wife).  It's the annual Hall of Fame Game at Canton, Ohio.  Denver (as a past resident of Seattle, my geographic location compels me to say BOOOOO!!!!!!) vs. Redskins (and Clinton Portis).  5 o'clock PT.  GO SKINS!!!!

						   It's been a little while since I've written anything here. Mostly it's a matter of just being able to sit down at the computer and relax enough to write a bit. Okay, now that that's over, let's get down to business. I was going through some old books and found this novel written back in the 70's called Ecotopia written by Ernest Callenbach. After reading it, I've found that it's a very well thought out version of a (his) future America that does a wonderful job of actually making you think, 'Could this really happen?' Now I know that my staunch Republican friend Karl will love to debate why this book would be absolutely impossible and would never happen but I'll go over a brief synopsis anyway.  In the year 1980, the people of Washington, Oregon and Northern California get tired of the constant problems with energy crises' and decided to break away from the Union to create their own more Earth-friendly society. By emphasizing an agricultural-athletic lifestyle instead of a industrial-sedetary lifestyle, the new society as a whole became self-sustaining with a healthy mental outlook on life while causing a positive impact on the environment around them.   Now it would take me a while to go through the particulars but if anyone's looking for a good, although dated, read, this is a good book to pick up.  And if you can't find it yourself, I'd be perfectly happy to lend you my copy.  And no, this book doesn't proscribe tree hugging to all mylogging friends here in Idaho, just a healthy respect for the woods around us and a sensible way of using and managing a renewable resource.  And that goes for you too Karl!!  Heh :D
