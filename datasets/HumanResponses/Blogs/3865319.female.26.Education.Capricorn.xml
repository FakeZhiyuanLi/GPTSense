      The article about internet use and the classroom reinforced the views I have on technology. I believe it is very important for schools to use the internet and computers to compliment lessons and projects.  Schools that provide classes that teach students about the information they obtain via the web will probably be more successful.  Students need to be taught how to use the internet and the information they receive.  The article mentioned several times that students know more about computers then adults and that is probably true, but they need to be taught the proper way to use the internet and the materials they collect.  I agree that students should be monitored when using computers.  There is to much information that students do not need to see while surfing the web.  I understand that students can not always be monitored but computers should be located where parents and teachers can observe what the student is searching for etc.  A computer in a bedroom should be unacceptable.  Parents need to take control and ask questions and go back and see what their children have been looking at and searching for while using the internet.  Many students are far more advanced then many adults when it comes to computer usage.  Computers are a great resource for adults and students.  I think that students need to be taught how to correctly use the information and parents need to be taught how to detect if the information is accurate and true.  If parents are going to allow a computer in their home then they need to take classes and become as computer literate as their kids.

      Technology is an area that we all have extensive exposure to, from televisions, to microwaves, cell phones and computers to name just a few. Although I use a computer for class assignments, and at home for email, paying my bills and internet access, I am far from a proficient user. I think that computers and technology are wonderful and great modern invention.........When they work. Nothing is more infuriating than a computer "timing out", "locking up" or other hiccups that leave the average user, frustrated. I believe that in today's classrooms computers can provide a useful learning platform and allows children access to the internet and educational programs. It also provides supplemental learning material that can compliment curriculum. I do think, however, that the responsibility to educate our children lies in the educator's hands and that responsibility should not be replaced by technology. Technology should be used as a tool, not a crutch.

       I am writing my response to Photoshop on Blogger because Tappedin did not let me "tap in" :)      Photoshop was  a fun program that I think my students would love to use.  The program is easy to use and can be beneficial  when students are doing projects etc.  I would love to have access at school to such programs to enhance the projects that my students do throughout the school year. I really enjoyed using the program!

         The article Learning to be wired was about computer usage in schools.  The author of this article went into an elementary school called Lowell Elementary.  The classroom that he entered was actively engaged in a writing activity on computers called the eMate.  One student told the author that the eMate is like a big PalmPilot.  The main purpose of this article was to see if technology in schools was necessary and beneficial.  All the research states that technology does not neccessarily improve students ability to learn, but it also does not hinder students.  Technology should be used as a tool for learning, not as the only way to teach.  The students at the Lowell school are already at an advantage to many other schools because they have the neccessary equipment and trained teachers to make technology successful in their school.  Some schools do not have opportunities to purchase technology.  Many of the teachers at the Lowell school were at first opposed to intergrating technology into the classroom, but a $400. grant was offfered to teachers that learned the programs and used them in their classrooms.  If programs were offered like that in every school, teachers would jump at that opportunity.  Technology is a wonderful tool that schools should be using as supplementary materials to teaching.  I believe that all schools should have their students using technology and learning the fundamentals of technology to make well rounded students.

       Not your Fathers shop class was a very interesting article. The main point of the article was to explain a new program being offered for high school students. This new program is vocational classes that allow high schoolers to receive classes on computers and computer programs. Students that attend these vocational classes take tests and then qualify themselves to work with certain companies. The up side to these courses is that students are gaining an advantage over their peers by receiving extra training in computers and allowing themselves to perhaps receive a job straight out of high school. The disadvantage to these types of programs is that technology changes so rapidly that by the time they graduate the programs may be different and their certificates are no longer valid. Most of the students who are in these programs are from a high poverty background and it enables some of these students to get college scholarships. The article also stated that these programs should be followed by college. A quote that I thought was appropriate was "Fulginiti says, "You still need a college degree -- especially if you're trying to get into management." Students like him, who have landed jobs paying $30,000 or $40,000 right out of high school, "are the exceptions," Chantilly's Wittmann cautions. "They are like the Kobe Bryants of the NBA. Certifications and career academies are not substitutes for college, but the good thing is that they can help students get jobs to pay for college." I agree that students will gain an advantage over their peers by taking these vocational courses. These courses however should not be seen as an "alternative" to college.
