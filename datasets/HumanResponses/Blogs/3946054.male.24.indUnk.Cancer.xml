       urlLink    Let me educate those that are reading on my morning. I knw, it could have been worse, but in my position, it's abt as bad as a morning can start. I walk into work, and my PC refuses to log in to windows. this continues for abt 30 mins or so... then finally after kicking, screaming, and a smoke; it decides that i've suffered enuff, and logs on. One would think that this would have been the end of my problems, but .......... NOOOOOOOO!!!!! im still on hold with the idiotic people of Rogers wireless, just so that i can give them further business... but what do they do... THESE ASSHOLES keep me on hold, goin on 35 mins.....&nbsp; urlLink
