      There are a number of reasons:  1. Having been recently rendered homeless, I tried looking for places to stay in Bacolod (i.e. hotels and pension houses). Needless to say, not even Google could solve my problem. Most places in Bacolod do not see (or perhaps, cannot afford) the value of a website, thereby leaving me very little to work on aside from names, locations and phone numbers. So much for boosting tourism. Aside from giving me the hassle of having to call these establishments overseas, I had no way of knowing how these establishments rated with other travelers. I ended up paying P750 for a place that CLAIMED to have hot water and a TV (hot water didn't work and TV had no remote control... had to stare at a blue screen...and ratty towels too).  2. I love evaluating things, especially service. Hey, I'm no MBA but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that people will always come back for good service, even if the prices aren't budget prices. And most Bacolod establishments need a serious customer service overhaul. (On pain of being sued, I will probably not use the real names of said criticized establishments, but I will make it a point to praise good service.)  3. Who knows, this will launch me a career with the Department of Tourism (uuhhhmmm.... is that a good thing?).  4. It will give me something to do while I am jobless (If I'm lucky, this blog just might die an early death).  5. Not enough people see the beauty in Bacolod. Well, there's the ugly too, and I hope I can present both fairly.  6.I want to present a more "bagets" (hey, I grew up during this time, okay??) point of view. I THINK it will be more entertaining than the official government version. I'll leave the boring academic stuff to the "experts." This is purely my point of view, and ME is a local mutant... in a "I belong but I don't belong" kind of way. Go figure.

      They say Negros is a place where the rich is really rich, and the poor really poor.  Someone close to me, let's call him Haciendero, is a typical example. His family, obviously, owns a hacienda. They have a string of other businesses, and can afford to go out of the country all together once, twice a year.  His family are nice people. They are well-educated, cultured, and religious. So it was a bit of a shock for me when, right before the milling season I saw some of their farm laborers at their house (the land and the house itself capable of being converted into another farm). While the Haciendero and his family sleep in their airconditioned rooms, each with adjoining heated baths, their workers were sleeping in the garage, on tables and benches covered with cardboard. I pointed out the irony to Haciendero, and the reply I got was: "These people are used to this kind of life. They are just thankful that they have work, food, and a place to live."  Huwwaaatttt????  How can such nice, educated people think this way? From my Machiavellian point of view, of course employers need to be careful about giving too many freebies to their employees, lest they abuse such generosity. But surely, there must be a standard setting what is considered "too generous" and what is upholding basic human decency.  I grew up in a middle class family, but our helpers ate the same food we ate, we made sure they at least had four walls and a roof around them, and a good bed when they slept.  Is it good enough to say that, well, life in the farm is much harsher and they should just be grateful they get what we give them? How do these workers feel, cooking sumptious food for their masters while they can only look forward to  pinamalhan  (paksiw na isda) for their meals?  These people may have not known any other, better life, and they may have the tendency to do stupid things like vote for FPJ, but they are human beings too. (OMG, is this me talking???)  They probably don't complain because they know they have no choice. But we who know better should act like it, don't you think? The only problem for people like Haciendero is: if they start giving their workers more decent working conditions, considering the thousands of farm laborers in haciendas, they can kiss their profits good bye. There goes capitalism for you.
