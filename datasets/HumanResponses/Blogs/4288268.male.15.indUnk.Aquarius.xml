        Today , it was a normal day for me. but last nite , it make me think over a lot of thing when i heard a story from the radio 933 that make me think over. It is a story about this guy who break with his galfren,YYY, but he still love the gal a lot. But the gal's coldness towards him make him him feel very sad. Then on the way he meet another gal ,xxx, they were normal fren at the first but later they become fren that tell each other everything like feeling . So the guy have fallen in love with this gal but he still love the ,YYY, so he really dun nod wat to do. One day , the guy died in a car accdient . Both gales, YYY did not cry and XXX cry for him. but after a few year, YYY marry a another guy while XXX was still love the guy alot and have reject a lot ppl who try to love her. The guy wait for a person that do not love him anymore and let a gal that love her a lot to go out of his life. After noding this story , it make me understand that we must tresure ppl around us . Jus tell this story to ppl and couple to tresure each other and not to say break so easily cos love hurts ppl.         From: guardian angel 11
