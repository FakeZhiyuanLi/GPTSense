       urlLink    Isn't she adorable?  This is our niece, Emerson.  It was the only picture I have on my computer worth posting, and I want to figure out how to post pictures.

      Okay, so the only really bad thing about Southern California is how much time you have to spend in your car.  I have been driving a minimum of two hours every day this week in my attempt to see everyone I've ever known in So Cal within the month of August.  Needless to say, I haven't gotten much work done. I did have this fun conversation about the concept of "deal-breakers."  You know, the things that mean you couldn't date someone.  The top thing, of course, was being a Republican, because obviously that is associated with all things evil and wrong in the world. My friend Amber says: "I would rather date a devil worshipper than a Republican."  Connie replies: "At least they have morals."  Ha ha ha ha.  I obviously have not given the concept of deal-breakers much thought, seeing as how I have been dating perfection for the last six years, but I decided that they would be: Republicans, overly religious people, people without a college education of some sort (exceptions might be made if you were really really successful and extremely intelligent without it, but really, does that happen?), and, for my superficial requirement--people who are shorter than I am.  What are yours, mysterious blog readers?  Post and tell me!

      I am going NUTS. You should not try to move out of state and see everyone that you've ever known in your life all in the same month. It is not a good idea. Something will suffer, and unfortunately, it turns out that it is work. Cuz who likes working, anyway? If, for any reason, Justin and I do not see you before we go to Eugene, it is not that we do not love you, it is that it is not physically possible for us to be stretched any thinner.  I wish that expression could be applied to real life. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could be "stretched thinner?" I would be a waif!

      I have to say that I did not intend to stay out all night last night. I made sure that I didn't drink so that I could go home early, and instead I end up talking politics ALL NIGHT LONG. Literally, I realized that I should go home because the sky was starting to brighten. Now, the reason that it lasted so long was that I kept trying to convince my friend Sparky that you can make a difference in the world. Essentially, at least, since all the topics that we covered basically would come down to that. It is my belief that while there are 280 million people in this country, if all 280 million of them say: "Fuck it, why vote? Why recycle? Why protest march?Why write letters to my congresspeople? It's not going to make a difference, so why bother?", then we are quickly going to be living in a pretty shitty country in my humble opinion. Granted, no one is perfect, we've all thrown an aluminum can away when you can't find a recycle bin, we've all thought that we should do something about this or that issue and never really followed up, but isn't there a million different things that you can do here and there to make a difference in the world? I mean, I don't like spending time outdoors, but that doesn't mean that I don't want there to be lots of forests and trees and bugs and dirt and other gross foresty things. How else is all that CO2 from pollution going to be converted back into oxygen? Where will Bambi live? Where will the Sopranos be able to bury the bodies? Obviously, if every person manages to bring cloth bags to the grocery store, generally recycle most things, and don't drive a monster truck, the world would be a hell of a lot better place! Of course, this isn't going to happen. But by making the choice, as an individual, to commit to doing just a teeny tiny bit to help the Earth, or telling someone that that racist joke was offensive, or that they believe that gay people should marry, or VOTING for crying out loud---then you ARE making a difference. Maybe not in some huge, direct, immediate rewards kind of way, but maybe someone will see you making these choices and reconsider their own positions on things, or be inspired to walk the five blocks to work instead of driving, or just to be a generally more conscious person instead of being one of the fucked up self-centered bastards that overpopulate this nation, damnit! That's how I think a difference can be made! The other very important way that you can voice your opinion on things is to speak with your wallet. Everything has a bottom line, the same way that everyone has a price. That's not cynicism, it's just true. Support cool companies by shopping there, avoid evil giants like WalMart. Buy organic once in a while. Support PBS. Don't buy a goddamn gas guzzling SUV. This is simple economics. Attempt to create a demand for goods and services that you value, while cutting the demand for cheap goods made in Taiwan. This is one of the reasons why I don't eat beef. Now, I've got nothing personal against the cow, per see. What I do have a huge problem with is the very poorly regulated meat industry. They pump these poor cows full of hormones, pack them in terrible, unsanitary living conditions, slaughter them in unsafe, atrociously disgusting slaughterhouses, pack them poorly and ship them out full of bacteria and other abhorrent foreign matter. Why should I support that industry? Appalling! And that's not even getting into things like the portion size of meat in America or it's inherent nutritional value. Now I'm just rambling. But I would like to close my rant with something that really validated the way that I choose to voice my opinions: I have very strong opinions on health and nutrition (which I research heavily) and I will often spout off on this subject, going on and on about the evils of the meat or dairy industry, the benefits of fiber, the lack of fruits and vegetables, portion sizes, etc...and I have been talking myself blue in the face to my addicted-to-junk-food-sister for years. The other day we were talking and she started telling me about how she now reads nutrition labels when she shops, and looks for things like fiber content and chemicals, and that even though she was loathe to admit, all of those years of my nutritional rants had  actually changed her behavior . That's amazing! I was so ecstatic that just by my voicing my opinion, I could effect change. Obviously, it's not easy, and most of the time you won't know that you've had an affect on someone, but it's worth it to give it a shot, right?

      What is it about me that I go into these fits of franticness? Some days I just wake up with this overwhelming urge to get everything done at one time, all on the same day--you know, the things you've been putting off, like changing the pile or doing the dishes or going through your closets or organizing everything you own into compartments and then breaking out the label maker. Doesn't everyone do that? So, we are in the process of moving. Not an across town-if you forget something go get it-a couple of trips in your friend's truck kind of move, but the pack up everything you own-cross state lines-really expensive kind of move. Our move date is September 1st, but I have already started the moving madness. I have also already wanted something that I packed up. Twice. And yet, every day, I want to put more things in boxes so that I feel like I'm more prepared for when the big day comes. Usually (I have done this big move thing a few times) I have a day or so to pack up the truck, then clean out the empty apartment. This time, we weren't so lucky. Our original move date was for August 30th, and we had our apartment until the 31st. Two full days. Then, when I went to secure the truck, I was told that I could not have the 30th, and that the 29th or 31st would be about $500 more than my estimated quote (our first move date was August 10th, so I was just trying to change our reservation). FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!!!! Jesus. Then the nice lady says that she can try to get me September 1st, at only ten bucks more. Thank goodness. The only problem with this is that I already put in my notice with my apartment that I would be gone by August 31st. I figure, I only put my notice in three days ago, they couldn't possibly have rented it yet, I'm sure one extra day wouldn't be a problem, right? Wrong. The miserable, paper pushing office girl does not seem to have an ounce of compassion for my plight. After much pleading, she relents--possibly because I have simply worn her down with my wheedling. How mush whining can one person take? So she says: "So can I schedule your move-out inspection at noon on the 1st?" Did you not hear a word I just said?!?! I can't even pick up the truck until 10 am! Do you really think that I can pack up and clean up and freak out and break at least three things all in the space of two hours!?!?! I decline the offering of noon and request the latest slot available. She sighs and informs me that they prefer to do inspections in the morning. I sigh and reply that I prefer to deal with people who meet minimum IQ requirements, but obviously we don't always get what we want. She bestows upon me, like she is a queen and she is knighting a serf, the offer of 4pm. Fine. This is the best that I will get. Of course, this now means that everything has to be packed up, cleaned out (And you should see their freaking list of cleaning requirements), and pristine within the space of 6 hours. Fun. So this is what prompts me to wake up sweating in the night with the fear that I won't manage to pull it off, that no one I know will show up to help me load the truck, they all hate me and are glad that I'm leaving and that the boxes that I've packed already will somehow untape themselves in the night and then explode all over the house in a fireworks show of a mess and there I will stand amidst the debris and cacophony, just as the inspector arrives. All right, it's not that bad, I'm sure it will be fine, as long as I'm prepared and most things are already packed up and cleaned up before hand. Hence, I'm already well on my way to packing up the house three weeks before our moving date.

      Why? Why, one might ask, should I spend the morning creating a blog when I have so many other things that are clamoring for my attention? I could be: 1) Working. I work from home as sort of a freelance artist for Trader Joe's, and I have plenty to do, especially in light of the fact that I blew off work last night to go drinking. 2) Retrieving my car from where I left it, since I couldn't drive myself home last night. I did, somehow, manage to get home and end up waking up fully clothed and on my boyfriend Justin's side of the bed. Regardless of the fact that it was 6AM, I woke him up so that he could tell me what happened. This is one of the many ways in which it is invaluable to have a partner in life. 3) Packing for the imminent move. As our move date fast approaches, I am simultaneously trying to donate/throw out/sell as much as I can part with, pack up the remainder, and see everyone in Southern California one last time before I flee the state (again). 4) Cleaning. Just because I always tack that one on to lists such as these. 5) Making breakfast. I haven't eaten yet. I think that this is the one that I'll do first. After this blog thing, of course.  So, why am I not doing any of the above mentioned projects? Because my friend Mara sent me an email about her new blog, and I was so jealous that I wanted one, too.
