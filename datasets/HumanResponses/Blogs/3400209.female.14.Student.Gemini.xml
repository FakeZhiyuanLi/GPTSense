      Depression is a common mental illness which is estimated to affect up to one in five Britons at some point in their lifetime and to cost the UK about £8bn a year in medication, benefits and lost working days.  It can strike at any age and the feelings of hopelessness and helplessness attached to it can make it difficult for people to carry out their normal activities.  It can be more or less severe and symptoms are often varied, making it often hard to diagnose.  It is thought that some individuals may be more prone to depression, whether because of life experiences, their body chemistry or genetically inherited conditions.  Those who have suffered from depression include Sir Winston Churchill and Florence Nightingale.    What is depression?   Anyone can suffer from depression. The most common symptoms include:  •	Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness  •	Feeling useless, inadequate, bad  •	A sense of self hatred, constant questioning of thoughts and actions and a constant need for reassurance  •	Feeling vulnerable and being oversensitive to criticism  •	Sense of guilt  •	Loss of energy and the ability to concentrate and be motivated to do even the simplest tasks  •	Harming oneself  •	Sudden loss or gain in weight  •	Sleep disruption or a need to sleep very long hours  •	Agitation and restlessness  •	Loss of libido  •	Physical aches and pains Most people only suffer two or three of these symptoms at any one time.  People with severe depression may also experience suicidal feelings, stop eating or drinking and suffer from delusions or hallucinations.  Many people who need treatment for depression suffer further bouts later in life.  Women are twice as likely to suffer from depression, but three times as many men commit suicide.  Experts say this could be because women are more likely to admit to depression because of the stigma attached to mental illness.      Different types of depression   There are many different types of depression, including clinically diagnosed depression, manic depression and post-natal depression.  Manic depression is marked by extreme mood swings, between highs when a person experiences excessive energy and optimism and lows when they may feel total despair and lack of energy.  It is often treated with lithium or, in extreme cases, electro-convulsive therapy.  Post-natal depression can occur from about two weeks after the birth of a child to two years after and differs from the mood swings suffered by many in the first few days after the child is born.  Other forms of depression include Seasonal Affective Disorder which is thought to be associated with the approach of winter and may be linked to lack of sunlight.    Causes of depression   Depression can be caused by a combination of factors.  It often runs in families, suggesting a genetic component, but it may be triggered by stressful events.  Major depressive illness is usually linked to some form of chemical imbalance in the brain.  It is also thought that people with low self-esteem, a pessimistic outloook on life and difficulty coping with stress are more prone to depression.  Life events which may trigger depression include bereavement, chronic illness, relationship problems and financial difficulties.    Treatment   In recent years, the market has been saturated by a range of new drugs called anti-depressants.  These include Prozac which is thought to correct chemical imbalances in the brain.  Other types of drugs may also be used to treat depression.  Many positive claims have been made for anti-depressants, but some patients experience bad side effects.  Other ways of treating depression include psychotherapy, which aims to uncover the reasons for depression and help the patient to find ways of overcoming them.  Self help groups may also offer people a forum for talking about their condition and sharing it with others so that they do not feel isolated and alone.  In extreme cases, a person with depression may need to be treated in hospital, for example, if they are threatening or have attempted to commit suicide.  If the person is deemed a risk to himself or others, he may have to be committed to hospital.  Besides psychotherapy and a course of anti-psychotic drugs, people in hospital may be offered or forced to undergo electro-convulsive therapy.  This involves applying electric currents to the brain. The treatment is controversial, but safety procedures have been improved in recent years.  Some psychiatrists are against its use, particularly without the patient's consent, but others believe it can be effective in dealing with life-threatening depression.

       How do people Self Harm?      There are ways people hurt themselves that are not listed here. The following Self Injury types are just the most commonly known.    Psychotic Self Injury :  Types of Psychotic Self Injury include the removal or amputation of body parts, such as eyes, limbs, ears, and genitals. These acts of Self Injury are usually done in response to visual or audible hallucinations. This type of Self Injury is severe and is easily identified.    Organic Self Injury :  Organic Self Injury usually stems from autistic disorders, developmental disabilities, and other psychologically induced disorders. This type of Self Injury is always influenced by physical or chemical problems in the body. Forms of Organic SI include head-banging and lip-biting.    Typical Self Injury :  Typical Self Injury results because of emotional or psychological reasons not related to psychotic (hearing voices, seeing things that aren't there, delusions) or organic (physical) conditions. The majority of the people who Self Harm fall into this catergory. This type of Self Harm is used to make yourself feel better and as a way of coping with your life. The following are the most common ways people hurt themselves:   Cutting :  Cutting, also known as slicing or slashing, is the most common way people hurt themselves. It is typically done with a knife, razor blade, piece of glass, or other sharp objects. Most of the cuts are done on the arms, legs, wrists, and chest; but other people cut on other parts of the body such as the stomach, face, neck, breasts, and genitals. But cutting on the arms and wrist is the most common because excuses can be made more easily (for example people can say that they had an accident while cooking).    Burning :  Burning is another common way people hurt themselves. Usually done with cigarettes, lighters, matches, kitchen-stove burners, heated objects (branding irons or hot skillets), and burning objects. Sometimes people even use flammable substances such as gasoline, propane, alocohol, and lighter fluid. Similar to cutting, most people burn themselves on their arms, wrists, legs, and chest.   Interference with wound healing :  Most people have unconsciously interfered with the healing of a wound but it is considered Self Harm when it is done deliberately. Some people remove stitches prematurely, stick objects such as needles, pins, etc. into the wound, or do other things to reopen the wound.    Hitting :  Hitting themselves with their fists is another way that people hurt themselves that is most commonly done on the head or thighs. Although it may not seem as serious as cutting or burning it is done for the same reasons and results.    Extreme nail biting :  It is common for most people to bite their nails. But when it is used as a form of Self Harm it is more severe and frequent than normal. It can result in the injury and damage of the fingernails or cuticles. People can bite their fingernails so much that they draw blood.    Scratching :  Another common thing amongst most people scratching can become a form of Self Injury. People who use it as a method of Self Injury make it more extreme in frequency, intensity, and duration. Area's of skin can become raw or sometimes even bloody. Usually the scratching is done with the fingernails but sometimes it is done with a sharp or semisharp object such as a knife, comb, or pencil. Sometimes it is done unconsciously.    Hair-pulling :  Trichotillomania is 'the excessive and recurrent removal of your own hair resulting in a noticeable loss of hair,' is the only form of Self Injury recognized as a psychological disorder by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Usually the hair is removed from the scalp, eyebrows, or beard, but can be from any part of the body. The bald spots that result from Trichotillomania are usually covered with a hat, bandage, or sunglasses.    Breaking of bones :  A form of Self Injury that is more rare than the others, the breaking of bones is a serious and severe form of Self Injury. Usually, people break their bones with an instrument such as a hammer, brick, or other heavy objects. But sometimes people throw themselves into walls or doors.

      Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disease. Approximately 1 percent of the population develops schizophrenia during their lifetime. People with schizophrenia often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others, or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behavior can be so disorganized that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others. Available treatments can relieve many symptoms, but most people with schizophrenia continue to suffer some symptoms throughout their lives; it has been estimated that no more than one in five individuals recovers completely.   This is a time of hope for people with schizophrenia and their families. Research is gradually leading to new and safer medications and unraveling the complex causes of the disease. Scientists are using many approaches from the study of molecular genetics to the study of populations to learn about schizophrenia. Methods of imaging the brain’s structure and function hold the promise of new insights into the disorder.

      One of the most common factors connected to Self Injury is shame. Any shame or embarrasment that comes from Self Injury can have a big effect on all parts of a self-injurers life such as friendships, school, and job performance. Also, shame is often a feeling that precedes Self Injury, coming from events that happened earlier in the individual's life. As has been stated earlier there is a obvious relationship between self-injury and child abuse. For many self-injurers, Self Injuring is connected with a traumatic childhood. Feelings of shame and embarrasment often follow the traumas they have experienced. Many people who have been abused feel that it is their fault, that they somehow encouraged, initiated, or/and deserved the abuse. These thoughts and feelings become connected with the memories of abuse, and then are transferred to SI behaviors. So, possibly if you feel shame or guilt or think you deserved to be punished, then you might act in ways that correspond those beliefs. You might hurt yourself if you feel that you deserve to be punished, for example.   The feeling of shame and embarrassment can result from many different parts of Self Injury, such as scars, wound, bruises, cuts, feelings from past traumas, emotions, etc.    Wounds, bruises, and scars  In many people who hurt themselves scars or visible cuts, bruises, wounds produce feelings of shame. Scars from self-injury "may be a life-long reminder of the injurious episode and may produce shame from internal thoughts or feelings as well as from external sources. Scars and other visible wounds can also be embarrassing when other people see them. Bruises, bald spots, and other visible, yet temporary, marks from Self Injury can be just as embarrassing as scars.   Many people find other people's scars interesting and ask questions like: 'What happened?' 'That must of hurt! How did you get it?' These questions and comments can result from exposing your self injury by, for example, wearing a short sleeved shirt; and can trigger more feelings of shame and embarrassment. Scars or wound not coming from an act of SI don't induce the same amount of shame; they might be slightly embarassing because they are not attractive, but some people wear them as 'badges of honor.' The reactions of other people to your scars or wounds depends on their source, and those reactions will affect your thoughts and feelings.   Most people don't understand self-injury and react akwardly when it is mentioned. Other people's responses often help increase your feelings of shame and embarrassment. By exposing scars, wounds, etc you risk people seeing, questioning, and reacting to your self-injury. So when other people question your scars you, anticipating their disgust, you might feel compelled to lie about their source. (Let me interrupt here: A excuse I used was that my aunt's Doberman had attacked me. This was a complete lie because my aunt doesn't own a Doberman.) For this reason you might hide or cover your scars and wounds.   Many people who self-injure try to hide their scars or injuries. You might wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, or hats in the hottest weather to cover your injuries. While you are SI-ing you may even consider where you're hurting yourself and how hard it will be to conceal.   Therefore shame and embarrassment from Self Harm can be very extreme. It is very hard to handle judgement and misunderstanding from others. And, sometimes the responses of other people to your Self Harm will cause to lie about your Self Harm, conceal it under clothes, etc. But by hiding your scars or wounds, or lying you are continuing the cycle of shame. 'Remember your scars represent survival. Your body carries indelible reminders of how strong you can be. It is important to view these marks with pride and respect. Only when you respect yourself can you begin to demand respect from others.'    Isolation and alienation  People who SI often feel shame because of the very nature of the behavior. You might feel alone in your Self Injurous activities. This may be due to the fact that you previously did not know anyone else intentionally hurt themselves. Self Injury is a behavior that's rarely discussed in society and has not been exposed by the media; and for these reasons you might have felt alone. You may feel different or "crazy" or abnormal. You may feel shame about your Self Injury because you have not yet realized that there are other people who also hurt themselves.   Self-Injury is different from other behaviors. Drug and alcohol abuse, eating disorders, gambling, etc. have gotten a large amount of media attention. The recognition of these behaviors may make those who have them feel less different, less isolated. Also for these behaviors there are often support groups in many cities. But although there are many people who Self Injury, rarely do you find large amounts of support and attention for this behavior.   Along with feeling different from other people some individuals feel embarrassed by the actual act of self-injury. The violence that goes with Self Injury may cause you to feel shame. You may feel guilty about hurting your body; about drawing blood, about causing permanent scars.    Vulnerability and loss of control  Seeing your own blood or wounded flesh may also cause feelings of shame. Exposing parts of your physical being that used to be hidden may cause you to feel embarrassed or ashamed.   Another source of shame is feeling unable to control your SI behavior. You may feel that hurting yourself means you are weak. You may have tried to stop SI-ing but found yourself unable to, which may cause feelings of failure and regret. If you have talked to anyone about your Self Injury you may not want to tell them about any new injuries. You may be embarrassed or ashamed that you hurt yourself again. You might even berate yourself for SI-ing, which is a behavior that helps you cope. But scolding or berating yourself doesn't usually help. Actually it might even increase your feelings of shame and embarrassment. The shame is caused by your perceived loss of control or failure.   For some people it is not the act of SI that makes them feel shame and embarrassment, but their inability to remember the SI incident. As has been stated earlier many people who Self Harm are in a dissociative state while they engage in their behavior. 'Dissociation distorts the conscience as well as decreased the experience of physical pain.' Some people dissociate more than others. You may even dissociate so much that you are unable to remember hurting yourself. This may cause you to feel shame, embarrassment, surprise, and confusion. This level of dissociation is not common but it can cause severe emotional consequences including large amounts of shame.    Overcoming shame  Shame can be a useful and appropriate feeling at times but it can also be very hurtful. 'Secrecy, isolation, alienation, depression, and self-hatred are all consequences of shame. Many of these consequence will increase your desire to hurt yourself, thus playing a major role in the cycle of self-injury.'   There are two main ways to reduce shame. One is to stop the behavior that causes those feelings. But Self Harm is probably your way of coping, and while stopping your SI behaviors will reduce your shame it is not a practical approach. Two is to change the way that you view Self Harm and how you think about it. Self Injury is a coping mechanism that you and many other people use to stay alive or control dangerous feelings. It may have even kept you alive, an alternative to suicide. The scars on your body and your memories are evidence of your ability to survive. If you begin thinking of self-injury as a 'method of coping, surviving, and caring for yourself, you are likely to decrease (and hopefully eliminate) shame and increase feelings of pride.'

      Self Injurious behavior is defined as deliberate, repetitive, impulsive, non-lethal harming of one's body.  Self injury includes:  1) cutting (may be done by knives or any sharp object, such as craft knives, or pins); 2) scratching: 3) picking scabs or interfering with wound healing; 4) burning; 5) punching self or objects; 6) infecting oneself deliberately; 7) inserting objects in bodily openings;8) bruising or breaking bones; 9) some forms of hair pulling, as well as other various forms of bodily harm. However, the self injurer may not be suicidal, and self harming may be a way of making sure that they are alive. The behaviors, which do pose serious risks, may be symptoms of a mental health problem that can be treated.   Incidence and onset.  It is estimated that self- injurers represent nearly one percent of the population, with a higher proportion of females than males. The typical onset of self- harming acts is at puberty. The behaviors often last for five to ten years but can persist much longer without appropriate treatment.   Background of self-injurers:  In general, persons seeking treatment are usually from a middle to upperclass background, of average to high and intelligence, and have low self-esteem. Nearly fifty percent report physical and or sexual abuse during his or her child. Many report (as high as 90 %) that they were discouraged from expressing emotions, particularly, anger and sadness.   Behavior patterns.  Many who self-harm used multiple methods. Cutting/scratching arms or legs is the most common practice. Self injurers may attempt to conceal the resultant scarring with clothing, and if discovered, often make excuses as to how an injury happened. The most common excuse is "The cat scratched me". A significant number are also struggling with eating disorders and alcohol or substance abuse problems. And estimated one half to two-thirds of self injurers have an eating disorder.   Reason for behaviors.  Self- injurers commonly report that they feel empty inside, over or under stimulated, unable to express their feelings, lonely, not understood by others and fearful of intimate relationships and adult responsibilities. Self injury is their way to cope with or relieve painful or hard- to- express feelings and is generally not a suicide attempt. But relief is temporary, and a self-destructive cycle often develops without proper treatment.   Dangers.  Self- injurers often become desperate about their lack of self-control and the addictive-like nature of their acts, which may lead them to true suicide attempts. The self -injury behaviors may also cause more harm than intended, which could result in medical complications or death. Eating disorders and alcohol or substance abuse intensify the threats to the individual's overall health and quality of life.   Diagnoses.  The diagnosis for someone who self-injurers can only be determined by a licensed psychiatric professional. Self-harm behavior can be a symptom of several psychiatric illness: Personality Disorders (esp.Borderline Personality Disorder); Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression); Major Depression; Anxiety Disorders; as well as psychoses such as Schizophrenia.   Evaluation.  If someone displays the signs and symptoms of self- injury, a mental health professional with self- injury expertise should be consulted. An evaluation or assessment is the first step, followed by a recommended course of treatment to prevent this self-destructive cycle from continuing.    Treatment.  Self-injury treatment options include outpatient therapy, partial (6-12 hours a day) and inpatient hospitalization. When the behaviors interfere with daily living, such as employment, school and relationships, and or are health or life-threatening, a specialized self injury hospital program with experienced staff is recommended.   The effective treatment of self-injury is most often a combination of medication, Cognitive/behavioral therapy, and interpersonal therapy, supplemented by other treatment services as needed. Medication is often useful in the management of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and the racing thoughts that may accompany self-injury. Cognitive/behavioral therapy that incorporate contracts, journals, and behavioral logs are useful tools for regaining self-control. Interpersonal therapy assist individuals in gaining insight and skills for the development and maintenance of relationships, and helps individuals understand their destructive thoughts and behaviors. Services for eating disorders, alcohol/substance abuse, trauma abuse, and family therapy should be readily available and integrated into treatment, depending on individual needs
