       Hey guys, sorry I havent posted in a while, it's not like I've been busy or anything :( (hint hint) everyone's gone or leaving or doing something, and its sad:'(, yes, im crying.  Yeah, so I saw Fahrenheit 9/11, it was hardcore yo, no but seriously I really liked it, I think Bush should see it and it's fucked up how its only playing in like 2 theaters in MD.

       So last night me, Natalie, Elissa, and Helen went to go see The Terminal. It was so cute! I felt so sorry for Tom Hanks but it was all ok in the end:). And our softball team lost the ternament, but thats ok because that means that I dont have to go on Sunday. Well also I went to the mall(in DC) with Maria and Eve on Thursday and it was cool(if you're interested in hearing more about it see Eves blog). And before that I really havent been doing much at all. Ok, if anything else happens i'll update you, not that you care, I mean, you're probably just bored if you're reading this anyway.

       SCHOOLS FUCKING OUT!!! Haha, score. It's especially funny because I haven't done shit the first two days of break. Yeah. So if you wanna do something, I'm avalible, again, that number is 301 434 6359, haha, i sound like a commercial. In other news, the cruise sucked. It was a nice yacht and all, but they only let us fucking dance for like, 20 minutes! I guess after they saw people "dancing nasty" they decieded to change it to fucking oldies, or at least that's my theory. Yeah. Well it's going to be sad not seeing the people that are leaving anymore, at least at school, (natalie, maria, sarah o., buckley?...) uh... and everyone else. I hope all you guys have a great summer, and have a wonderful time and your new schools. I also hope I'll see all you Blairians some more at Blair, because that's our new mother fuckin' school! Yeah BITCH! Wow, well I'll post some more over the summer, and I hope I'll see you guys later!:):):):):) HAVE A GREAT FUCKIN SUMMER!!

       I just found out tonight that my cat isnt going to live but only a few days more.&nbsp; This may seem stupid to some of you, especially you without pets, but I love her so much and since my mom told me we are going to have to put her to sleep I've been crying for the last few hours.&nbsp;Shes been my cat since the day I was born.&nbsp; Shes a year older then me and shes had a long full life, but its been hard to bear these past few weeks.&nbsp; She's skinny and can barley keep her balance, she wont eat, and her eyes are all out of focus.&nbsp; I love her so much but I can't even find her, I dont want her to die before I can even say goodbye to her, I dont know if writing this is making it better or worse, but it all seems so quick and I dont want her to go.&nbsp; I'm sorry if you think I'm ranting and raving, in that case you dont need to be reading this... but I really love her and really am going to miss her a lot.&nbsp; I'll be back later on, bye.

       Damn, I havent posted in a longass time, is it because im lazy? Yes. Um, well I guess I'll tell you about my day so far, which hasnt been eventful. I woke up at 8:00 to let out Angel (rosies dog) and went straight back to bed where I stayed for about 2 hours until my mom woke me up and told me that I had to go feed the cats up the street so I did. I felt sorta sick after that, dunno why, so I took a bath which got me really tired so I crawled back into bed and slept some more until 3:oo. Then I woke up, came downstairs and had a nutricious breakfast consisting of icecream and a peach. Then I watched some Recess on toon disney and went on the computer some, talked to Murphy, Eve, the ussual and watched some more TV. Right now it's 4:40 and my parents are gone and I'm bored and nothing's on the like 500 channels I have and theres nothing to read and UGHGHG!! I also feel kinda sick or else I might be going for a run, which I'm not, which I should be doing. Damn, school starts soon and I didnt even realize it! Just like 3 more weeks, god damn. HIGH SCHOOL! Jeez. Well, bye bye for now, I have nothing more to say. I'll post later.
