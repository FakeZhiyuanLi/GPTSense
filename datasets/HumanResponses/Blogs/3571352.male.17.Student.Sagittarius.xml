      Today I went to the family picnic to celebrate my Grandma's Birthday.  We had food... and stuff.  It was fun.  I will post some pictures later.  Anyway my mom woke me up at like 5am today to say her computer had a virus... I was like Norton takes care of it.  She didn't believe me so I went back to sleep.  Then she woke me again at 5:30am and said she could not find the file that Norton found... That's because NORTON TOOK CARE OF IT!  She was so pissed off and she said she did not start working on the computer until 6:30am because Norton had to finish and it found no viruses.  She did not listen to me and I told her what to do.  Now she is all-mad at me because I did not get up and take a look.  Now if it was normal human hours I would have gotten up and looked but not at 5am!  So after I got up for real... around 10am I mowed the grass.  The lawn mower safety handle broke thus not allowing me to start it up.  So I had to rig it up to finish mowing, which was real fun. :-/  After that I left for the picnic.  I am at my Grandma's right now so I will post some pictures when I get home.

      Happy day for me :).  My college tuition goes down another $1000 because of the "Imagine America" scholarship.  I also received a $200 scholarship last night from the  urlLink Woodbridge Garden Club  for creating their website.  Well today was okay.  It was cloudy most of the day and we had the Senior Picnic.  I interviewed my friend Brandon about the picnic via cellular phone (see post below) to see how he liked it.  Well listen to it and you will find out.  I only was there for like 20 minutes and went back to shop... So it was sort of bad.  As I was coming home from school I almost broadsided this old man.  He just pulled out right in front of me on Bordentown Avenue in Sayreville.  I had to hit the breaks so hard to not hit him.  Well so hard that it left marks on the freshly paved pavement! :-P  I don't think he had a clue what was going on.  I was on my horn and he didn't even flinch about his bad judgment.  Anyway  "Peace_to_TheBrokenCrew_you_all_leet"

      Well only 10 more days left till graduation.  Then no more high school.  I will be missing the place but I got to move on.  I will be starting Chubb in September and will take the Network Security course.  That will run for 13 months.  Hopefully after that I can get a job in the field and live my life. (if there is no draft :-X) We will just have to wait and see, that's all.  Today was rather crappy.  We did nothing in gym but sat outside because of the temperature... It was about 94 with a heat index of 100.  We sat around in shop because we already completed our work.  So not too much of a school day.

      Ah.. I am gone from school one day and I am deemed "Mr. Format".  You know who you are ;-).  Well that should have been my Senior quote because I format my PC like you change oil on a car... 3 months/3,000 pop-ups. :-P  So I  blew off gym and played Frisbee.  It was too damned hot to play kick ball on the pavement.  So after gym and lunch I went to my shop.  There was a computer to be repaired so I formatted it and brought it back to its stable state.  Well it just so happens that this computer had a virus on it that I fixed and the half-assed school network had a virus that kept shutting down the computers and rebooting them.  The head tech guy (EavesDropper) overheard my conversation with another person about a virus and assumed it was his situation.  He rambled on about "why are you touching those computers?"  Your not suppose to touch my computers" blah blah blah.  You should have see him when I said it was MY computer that I brought in to work on had a virus (though it really was not).  His comment was "Your Commercial Art, your not suppose to fix computers!"  This got me a little pissed off, lets just say to take my army knife and accident's drop it by his car and slip when picking it up WHOOPS! *Air Leaking*.  Though I would never do this ;-) because I know more than the damned tech's at my school its rather sad...  Well this virus was propagating off of the main server to the other clients on the LAN.  They are running all over the place trying to figure out what is going on.  They could have easily got a FIREWALL or even unplugged the damned thing from the LAN to prevent the thing from spreading.  All I can say is that they are idiots... Simple.  I can't believe that they actually went to school for this shit and can't narrow down which machine is sending out the virus.  Well enough of their sorrows, after school I went over to  urlLink Mac's  house where we played some Sonic Adventure and attempted to get his Mac Color Classic online.  This was useless, even though we put the proper IP in, EST. It still didn't work.  ---------------  Tech Tip of the day (if you did not get it before):   USE A FIREWALL!!11

       A Free Alternative To Microsoft Office!   Can't afford Microsoft Office? Get the next best thing... FOR FREE!  urlLink OpenOffice  is a totally free Productivity Suite for all operating systems! It works on Windows, Mac, and even Linux!  OpenOffice Features:  Word Processing (Word Like Program) Spread Sheets (Excel Like Program) Presentation Tool (Power Point Like Program) Drawings and Diagrams Database Access (Access Like Program) Microsoft Office Compatibility One-Click Export to PDF Export to Flash (.SWF) Accessibility Support for many native languages Open XML File Format API and File Format Compatible with StarOffice 7 Office Suite Macro Recorder 3rd Party Add-ons XML File Filter Tool ActiveX Control Support for DocBook and PDA File Formats MySQL Integration and much much more  A full list of features can be found  urlLink here .  From just reading this it has what Microsoft Office has and more! If you are big on free I would definitely check this out!  ---------------------------   Keep your computer in tip-top shape!   While browsing the internet I have compile some links that will keep your computer in it's fittest form. The next time you get up and use your computer, it may be feel like you just formatted!   Anti-Virus :  This is a very crucial part of your system! No computer should be without an anti-virus, especially when using P2P software or continuously connected to a broadband connection.  In my opinion  urlLink Avast! Anti-Virus  is the best Anti-Virus to use. It automatically scans incoming e-mails (when using Outlook or Outlook Express) and downloads. This can be considered the bouncer of viruses because if you have it enabled... you should not get any viruses what so ever infecting your system.  Home Edition:  FREE  Professional: $39.99   urlLink Norton Anti-Virus  is my runner up for Anti-Virus programs. Price: $50  I know what you are saying... "I don't want to put out $50 for an anti-virus software that will have to be bought every year". I don't blame you! Because there are some free solutions out there for your protection.  urlLink AVG Antivirus  and  urlLink Avast! Home Edition  are free for personal use, business use you have to pay for. I myself have not use this, but ANY anti-virus is better than not having any! I looked at it and it seems to do the same things as Norton but in a free personal edition version.    De-fragging :  People are always telling you to defrag your computer to keep it optimized... but how can you remember this?? When you do remember it is always when you have to do something! Plus Window's built in defragger doesn't always work to its full potential. There is a software out there that can automatically schedule or sense when your hard disk needs defragging! It is called Diskeeper. The price is $34.95 on CD-ROM or $29.95 download. There is a free Version out called  urlLink Diskeeper Lite  . It has the same powerful defragger but without the scheduling or automatic defragging process.   Spyware :  This is a big problem on systems that can not only slow down your computer but send personal information out to large companies such as web-pages you visit and what you do on the internet. This can be in different forms... cookies.... software... p2p software. To protect yourself I would recommend these FREE TOOLS  urlLink SpyBot Search and Destroy  or  urlLink Ad-aware . If you never ran one of these programs you should... you will be surprised what is on your system!  I hope this software will keep your system optimized and keep your computer running longer before formatting again!  Enjoy!

      My website,  urlLink Sewaren.net , is getting popular.  I had someone from the radio station  urlLink New Jersey 101.5  email me about the pronounciation of Sewaren.  Well it is pernounced SEE-Warr-en just to let others out there know.  I hope they found the website resourceful.

      Well today was our Senior Cut day at East Brunswick Vo-tech so I decided to stay home.  So I woke up late and took a walk down by the waterfront in Sewaren.  I took some pictures of the boats that went to and from Hess.  After that I cleaned the car and installed my super bright 5000mcd LEDs that came in the mail today.  I will post some pictures later.

      W00T!  My dad approves of the 7.1 Home Theater setup and I will be installing it this summer. :-D  We are un-decided on what type of speakers we will be getting but I will keep you posted.  Today I unlocked an AT&T Wireless GSM phone.  Now it works on ANY GSM provider that uses 800/1900 Mhz GSM signal.  It is a Nokia 3590, but hey, I got it for free and now it can be used. :-)  I can show you how I achieved this but I'm not sure if you guys can handle it. ;-)  If I see enough feedback on this subject I will post it.

      I was bored in shop again and I was searching for how to make an  urlLink e-book  on a Palm Pilot.  So I found that by using  urlLink DropBook , a free application, I am able to convert .txt documents into full e-books.  Now I know it sounds too simple and it is... just to make the book you need to use the  urlLink Palm Markup Language .  This language will allow you to add chapters and such.  Here is an example of the code:  ----------------------  \r \p \c \w="50%" For Reba Vartanian, Shelly Jaffe, Chickie Leventhal, and Mitchell Mitnick, and for the late Alan Mitnick, Adam Mitnick, and Jack Biello \w="25%" For Arynne, Victoria, and David, Sheldon,Vincent, and Elena. \w="50%" \c \p  \x\BSocial Engineering\B\x  \iSocial Engineering\i uses influence and persuasion to deceive people by convincing them that the social engineer is someone he is not, or by manipulation. As a result, the social engineer is able to take advantage of people to obtain information with or without the use of technology.  ----------------------   The \w="50%" would made a solid line 50% of the width of the screen.  \x makes new chapters. \i makes italics. \p makes a new page.  Check out the  urlLink Palm Markup Language  site for more info on the coding.  This would be excellent for english class where you have to read that Shakespeare Novel.  You can find the novel online at various sources.  You can then convert it to e-book with chapters and all the markups necessary.  The best part about an e-book is that you can make virtual notes in the book as well as highlight and bookmark.  If you have a Palm Pilot (or a pocket pc) I would recommend checking this out.  I enjoy using my Sony Clie as a book. :-)

        urlLink     This is my 802.11b wireless setup.  It consists of a D-Link DWL900AP+, a reverse polarity SMA male pigtail to a Male N-Connector, and a 36" Pacific Wireless 12dB gain antenna.  So you can probably get this piece down the block and even 1/4 to 1/2 mile with the proper antenna. ;-)

      Tired of the regular old AOL Instant Messenger?  There are some other alternatives out there but the one I like the best is gAIM.  Not only does it support AIM, it supports ICQ, MSN, Yahoo, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, and Zephyr networks as well.   urlLink gAIM  is available on Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Qtopia (Sharp Zaurus and iPaq) operating systems.  It is advertisement free and is fully customizable with many free plugins.  It also has the ability to use @mac.com emails as screen names.  Some of the features include:  * Tabbed IMs * iChat like buddy list * Plugins * Themes * Buddy pounce * IM encryption ( urlLink using plugins with other gAIM users )  I highly recommend gAIM if you are looking for something new in place of AIM or any other instant messaging providers' software.   urlLink It is well worth a download .

      I had a decent day today.  I finished my Math final and most of the English one.  Tomorrow I start the History final.  The freshmen were taking their finals in shop so all the seniors just talked and talked.  Hey!  They did it to us when we were taking our NOCTI certification so they can shove it.  I filled up the tank today $13 for 6.9 gallons.  I'm glad I got the Saturn now. ;-) I get about 30 miles to the gallon.  I'm feeling another AudioBlog.  We will see tomorrow. ;-)

      Are you tired of getting the messenger Service popups every time you go online?  Well there is an easy solution to that problem.     Goto:  » Start » Settings » Control Panel » Administrative Tools (under "classic view") » Services  Now locate the service "messenger" and click stop.  It's that simple!  You could also stop those popups by using a firewall.  You can use the Windows Firewall (Under Windows XP) or use the Free ZoneAlarm I told you about yesterday.  If you want to send messages to someone go to the command prompt and type this in:  net send "ip address" "message you want"  Do not use the ""s  I just used them to seperate the message.

       urlLink Zone Labs: FREE ZoneAlarm Firewall   Firewalls are an essential part of internet life.  If you are not running a firewall (hardware or software) chances are your computer could become infected with a virus or other malicious software.  That virus then can be transmitted throughout your Local Area Network (your home or SOHO) and even back out onto the internet where it can cause mass chaos.  That's how a lot of spam emails are sent from your own email address without you even knowing!  Today I am showing you a  FREE  firewall from Zone Labs for home use.  You will be able to determine what can and cannot enter or exit your computer.  You will also be able to block certain applications from going out and keep viruses and hackers out of your system.  I would take advantage of this nice product even if you are on 56k it will still keep your computer safe.

      Today was good.  I didn't get woken up at 5am like yesterday. :-P  I washed the Satty then I went to the Waterfront Festival.  There were many people... too many in my opinion.  It was like a Main Street Fair but in Sewaren by the water.  The food was too expensive so I just got a $4 smoothie instead.  NJ 101.5 was there and I got a cup and a catwoman poster (purr).  My sister played piano for a crowd at the park and got sunburn (pwned).  I left after she was done playing and I tried out the "course" at WHS.  After that I came home and stuff.  Tomorrow were get to start finals! Yay!

      Well with more and more people sharing files on P2P networks it is important to not share files that are copyrighted.  Even if you are not sharing copyrighted files your probably still paranoid about being sued.  There was one incident of a university professor sharing a mp3 of his class lesson and it just happened to have the same matching name of a music artist.  So the one thing you can do to protect your identity on the internet is by tunneling through an anonymous proxy.  There are many free ones available on the net you can search google for free proxies.  The proxy speeds will vary and may not be as fast as your internet connection but your IP address wont be shown to anyone except the people running the proxy.  Another thing to do is [ if you can ] is to use a wireless access point.  There are many un-encrypted access point around.  There might even be one next door. ;-)  Hey, if the wireless signal is not encrypted and it is on my property  why  can't I use it.  Now if it's encrypted don't try and hack it because they obviously do not want you on their wireless network; not to mention it would be illegal.  As long as it is un-encrypted, why not use it?  Your internet IP address will not be shown, only theirs would shown.  Also be sure to run a software firewall on your end to protect yourself from their LAN.  You may need a "cantenna" or some other industrial WI-FI antenna and a "pig tail" to fit your wireless card's needs.  Take a look at  urlLink Fleeman Anderson & Bird Corp   for antennas and "pig tails"  they also have the necessary equipment so you can make your own "cantennas".  [Try searching for this one ;-) ]  If I get enough feedback about this then I will post some more.

I was sad, very sad when I walked in to the auditorium for the first time that evening.  Afterward I was very happy to be graduating.  I enjoyed my 4 years at EBVT and I would love to do it all over again if I had the chance.  I will be missing my teachers especially Providenti, my Commercial Art Instructor.  I will be missing my other teachers and friends as well.  I know most of them will succeed in the future and I wish them the best of luck.  - I will miss you EBVT

       urlLink      Well it has been well over month now since I started keeping track of the gas mileage on my car.  Well, the average miles per gallon is about 29.2.  I'm glad I did not get a v6 or a v8 with these outrageous gas prices.  For those of you who don't know about my car it is a 2000 Saturn SL2.  It's a 125 HP DOHC 4-cylinder and has more power than my mom's Ford Taurus G, 130 HP SOHC V-6, and gets way better gas mileage.  To keep track of your gas mileage I would suggest using  urlLink TotalCar 6.0 for the Palm Pilot  (freeware) or if you do not have a palm pilot I suggest using  urlLink New Jersey Gas Prices .  If you are not from New Jersey do not worry.  They have a webpage, database, and fuel log for every state.  I would highly recommend checking out these resources to keep up upon your gas mileage as well as if the digital pumps are working correctly.  So when you go to the gas pumps bring a pencil and paper and write down the following.  » Odometer Miles » Price per gallon (ie. 1.879) yes the 9 at the end is important. » Total amount paid » How many gallons they have pumped (be exact)  If you look at my fuel log image above you can see the weird MPG trend.  I could have been getting bad gas mileage because I waited almost 1,000 more miles to get it changed.  After I got it changed my miles per gallon went up by around 5.  So it pays to maintain your car!

       urlLink Michael Moore Hates America   Yes!  In fact Michael Moore does hate America.  Yet he is living here to make money off of our brain dead folks in this country.  If you think Michael Moore is a "good guy" then you should be ashamed of yourself!  If you do your research he had some Anti-American propaganda a few days after 9/11/01.  I highly suggest  DOWNLOADING  Fahrenheit 9/11 because it is not worth paying for.   He is making money off of his Anti-American movie!   I would also suggest checking out this Pro-America movie and watch some  urlLink O'Reilly Factor  on the FOX news channel.  Sorry I just had to vent.. BTW if you were just wondering about Fahrenheit 9/11 its 57% done with 45 minutes left. ;-)

      For added security you should always clear the page file upon shutting down your computer.  Windows uses this file as extra RAM.  So whatever you opened up is then stored on the pagefile for quick access.   THIS IS NOT ENABLED BY DEFAULT  so you must do the registry work yourself.  They say it may increase the shut down time of your PC but I don't notice it too much.  » Start Regedit (Start > Run > "regedit") » Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management » Select  ClearPageFileAtShutdown  from the list on the right. » Right on it and select  Modify . » Change the value to 1 to enable. » Reboot your computer.   ¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤   There is another cool program called  urlLink Eraser .  This program "shreds" your files as well as unused disk space.  Why is this so important?  When you normally erase a file it still exists on your hard drive.  Windows justs writes some code before the file so the operating system knows it can just overwrite that file if need be.  This software will actually just write random data over your file so you can be sure it cannot be recovered.  From the website: "Eraser is a secure data removal tool, which allows you to remove sensitive data from your hard drive by overwriting it with carefully selected patterns."

      Good old Windows!  Now I have to format again!  I seem to format every three months or every three thousand popups.  I hate that it takes forever to restore Windows, the drivers, and crucial applications.  I am trying out  urlLink Acronis True Image 7.0  which will make an image of my hard drive as I want it.  Then when things get really messed up I do not have to sit around all day to format, put drivers on, ect.  Now I can boot from the rescue media and restore my hard drive image from CD, DVD, Zip and more!  Now I have not done this yet but I will be testing the restore soon after I format.  It should take much less time than it does to install windows and all of the components.  I would suggest taking a look at this ingenious piece of software!

      Well I know I have not been updating the blog as much as I have been in the past.  I have been very busy with everything.  It's been a hellish week so far.  1. My computer power supply dies. 2. People are assholes while driving. 3. eBay + Microsoft = Don't Mix 4. Lock down your access point(s)!  That's just the summary.  1. I was wondering what this burning smell was that was in my room.  I though nothing of it and I noticed that my system and & CPU temps were over 110F.  So I finally decided after two weeks to take it apart and test it.  Well now it makes an unusual buzzing noise and gets VERY hot.  Mind you this is the third power supply for this PC.  So I had to run out to Best Buy and order a new one for $70.  Then I really could not have waited to get this fixed so yeah.  I check eBay and they have the same power supply for about $40 shipped.  I was mad but oh well.  2. Some woman in Colonia, NJ decides it is okay to stop in the MIDDLE of the road to talk to her "friends" by their house.  Lady... pull the fuck over!! We exchanged a few words and left it at that.  I had some other sinister plans like blast some hard-core RAP or death-metal rock while laying on the horn till she moved, but I did not think of this until I was 1/2 way home.  This was coming back from Best Buy mind you.  3. Well eBay closed down my auction for Office 97 Professional FULLY SEALED NEVER OPENED!  There was nothing wrong with it!  It was not OEM or NOT FOR RESALE.  So I don't know what the problem is with them.  Well anyway I am never gonna list ANYTHING Microsoft on eBay again.  4. Well someone for two weeks was sitting on my Wireless Network.  I just found this out two days ago.  I'm not sure what he was doing there but he cracked my WEP code.  I was not too happy about this so I changed my name, changed the channel, changed the WEP key, and disabled SSID broadcast.  I will discuss more on wireless security later on when I get some more time.  .Signing off.
