      This subject is still coming up here and there in my life. I posted this to the Monogamy tribe this after having a breakthrough last December.  º   º   º   º   º   º   º   º   º   º   º   º  thank you. now I can rest.   I just want to make it known how glad I am that there are people like me that are monogamous and like it that way. And this is all coming from a borderline nymphomaniac. Just ask all my lovers.   A few months ago, I fell madly in love with an amazing man. Within a few weeks, it became apparent that his tendencies and desires leaned toward poly-this and poly-that, and that despite our mutual love for each other, there were issues sitting under the surface waiting to rear it's ugly head. But we both wanted to try to work with it... whatever "it" was. I am the kind of person who is totally willing to entertain new ideas and ways of being. I'm open to it. But I found that every time my mind wandered into that strange, dark place, as hard as I tried I just couldn't get comfortable. I wanted to be with this person so much - because of all the delightful things he had to offer - that I considered being polyamorous, even after a lifetime of being a serial monogamist. That's what love does.   Then suddenly, he left. Disappeared. Gone. Poof. No gotta gos, no see ya laters, no poor excuses just to get out of it (which would have been just as compassionate despite it's transparency). So all I had was all this space to really think about it. I was in a state of suspended belief, thinking he was going to come back at some point. While I was waiting and wondering, I had all this opportunity to go deep and look at the subject of monogamy vs polygamy (or polyamory). I was torn. I rationalized. I considered. I theorized. I respected. I was repulsed. I was titilated. I wandered alone through the foggy, dimly lit unknown. I was cold.   Then while investigating all the poly-this tribes and fucking-that tribes (which there is no shortage of) in a desperate attempt to get it to make sense to me, I stumbled upon this tribe called monogamy. Wow. What a concept. I immediately jumped in. I read a few threads where I finally found my people shouting to the rooftops "we are not freaks!" I almost wanted to cry because I recognized my truth with clarity. I was tired of feeling like an outcast in the mire of tribe sluts and dominatrixes and their unspoken competion of who can be more deviant or have the smuttiest titty/cock/fetish shot in their picture gallery.   It was this tribe that snapped me out of it and made me look at myself and see what was really there, a wonderful, adventurous, sexy, monogamous woman, and to climb up to my rooftop and shout. "I am monogamous! I LIKE being monogamous! It's my natural state of being! And know what? I'm going to find an amazing man - maybe two! - that will appreciate that! And we are going to fuck A LOT! And it won't get boring!" And then under my breath I will utter ...polygamy is for people with no imagination...   So thank you. Now I am clear about who I am. In that sense.

      I'm having a unsettling day. There are days when I just can't get my point across, and the universal hum is more like the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard. That's the time that I start talking. I need to get centered by bouncing off of the people around me. And out of the blue, a friend wrote to me to see how I was doing. He asked me about my love life, and if my burning desires for an intellectual equal, a lover, a hunk, a trusting and trusted friend and a passionate love maker been satisfied.  I'm sure he was expecting the usual rundown of the men in my life at the moment, and the various levels of emotional depth with which I was entertaining them, all the while laughing through the flower and condom- filled meadows of joyous passion.  Nope.   I have yet to meet that guy. He has eluded me for years. I don't feel like I'm getting any closer to him. I can't imagine, right now, finding a man who  A. wants more than just sex; B. will want to be with me as much as I want to be with him, and C. has the same ideals and moral character as I do. Honey, I've been with all kinds. I thought by now I would have found someone compatible. I'm losing hope. Not in finding someone that will make my heart sing, I fall in love all the time. But finding someone that makes my heart sing AND that I can build a life with... that's seems to be a sisyphean task.    I have had my share of ups and downs this past year, after breaking up with my boyfriend of four years last August. It has been wonderful to be single again and out of that relationship. But I have had my heart let down at least three times since then, and broke a heart myself once. Dating is not easy. A lot of dashed hopes. It gets very discouraging. Then there's the whole feeling of being cheap and sleazy when I sleep with someone I really like and I think might become someone significant to me, and then a few weeks later it doesn't work out... or he disappears... and I am left with the feeling that I shouldn't have gotten to intimate so soon, and I wonder if I did the right thing or not. I have needs like a man has needs. But, the message that intimacy carries is too potent. My lesson here is to hold on to that for a while and wait to be intimate with a man, because if I do that too soon, he looses interest. I don't know why, because when a man sleeps with me on the second or third date, I don't think less of HIM or loose interest. So, I don't get why that's the case with the men who I go out with.  *big sigh*  So, I haven't been pursuing much, and not much that I can sink my teeth into has been coming my way. I find men who are interested in me all the time, but on a very superficial level. They think I'm hot, and interesting, and a whole lot of good woman, but they don't exactly know what to do with me. They're often too emotionally weak or unavailable to follow through with their proclamations of attention and devotion. I'm sick of these guys. I wrote a song about it. It's just a loose version, but it goes something like this:  I want a man with a backbone I want a man with some balls I want a man who can say "fuck you!" to me when he says NO to me I know it means I Love You  Instead, I start sleeping with these wonderful guys who are still licking their wounds from the last relationship they had (jayzus get over it already), who tell me as much but keep calling and coming over because I'm stupid enough to let them, thinking they really like me for my personality. Then when I start having feelings for them, and I'm all delusional that they feel the same way, they sniff it out like a bloodhound and suddenly I'm trying to figure out why they haven't returned my call... in three weeks.   It's been a hard lesson for me, but I'm starting to get it. So I've been just doing my thing, meeting some grerat guys but not exactly believing them anymore when they say all those nice things about me ("you're an amazing woman, Betsy, you really are... I've never met anyone like you... you're incredibly sexy and blah blah blah..."). It's just too hard to know what to believe anymore when I've been lied to so often. I'd rather just pursue my interests, I have so many, and find my bliss in that.  And the next time I get laid, it will be so good my head will probably pop off.

      I think I might be going through some kind of hormonal shift or something, because I have been easily moved to tears a lot lately. It might be because the things that show up in front of me are truly moving. There have been running themes of serendipitous nature, that relate to the things I have been mulling over during this latest existential challenge. By the way, I don't believe in mid-life crises - I think they happen pretty much bi-annually.  Freedom is one of the themes. I have chosen to fly free again, and I'm inching closer to the window sill and cleaning my wings. I'm scared. I'm also really really excited. I have more faith about this mission than I have had about any others, maybe because I have more at stake this time and the angle of my perspective is different from the angles I've had before. The other times that I've taken risks in my life, I really had nothing to lose. It's easy to create and manfest a destiny when the ground you're looking at is just uneven dirt. This time, I am leaving the cozy weekend retreat of safety, where there's a freezer full of comfort food and all the pay-per-view I can stand until I fall asleep under the down of a regular paycheck. Lately I've been looking out the window at all my friends, who might be a little hungry and freezing their butts off but happy and challenged and creating their own little freaky realities that look like a whole lot more fun than mine. You can only watch so many movies before you want to go join the kids at the art table and make your own cool hat.  So what I've chosen is freedom. I've decided that what I want to buy with my money is the freedom to be my own boss, to live the dream that so few of us complacent eighteenth-generation Americans seldom aspire to, to earn my own day off and take it when I say so. I need room to grow as an artist and I just can't squeeze it into the fatigued weeknight evening when I can barely muster the energy to empty my car from the precious weekend trip out of town. I need room to slow down and appreciate the day that God gave me to enjoy, whether it's raining or shining, and not be still in yesterday, nor in next week, but present now to it's still perfection. I need the freedom to be proud of my accomplishments, because I'm going to rock harder than I ever have before, and I won't have to consider each success just another bullet point on my annual review. I need the freedom to be accountable only to myself, and therefore to be, again, painfully honest with and about myself and relearn humility. But also to truly play and discover some of the most joyful talents of mine that my two-hour commute could not afford me. The freedom to explore.  So when I saw the photo of the macaque sitting on the research lab cage that had been his home for 30 years, wondering what to do now that he had the freedom to roam around his new leafy man-made habitat, for some reason it hit me in the sweet spot between the sentimentality of ending my own jail term here and the happiness I feel for both of us. I just looked at the face of the old monkey and thought of what he might have been thinking. "Now what?" I imagined him being scared to leave the safety of his cage, something that became as familiar to him as his own hands. I guess I got choked up because I understand him.  At least he won't have to worry about rent.

      1  As the surf recedes back down the sloping beach in front of me, the medium sized round rocks bang together and make a wet, percussive sound as they roll and smack into each other in the water. I look off to my left, and four surfers are floating in the water, waiting for the seventh wave of the set so they can ride it in. The tide is coming in and the water is getting closer to my prophylactic post-op boots, but I'm not worried that I'll get wet because I'm far enough up the sloping beach. I can tell which black wetsuit when standing is Rahsaan- I have studied his body for hours by now, his mesmerizing, delightful body, addictive in it's muscular beauty. At least in my eyes. Even far away, as a spec, I can tell that it's him - his low center of gravity, his very broad back, his hey dude stance even when riding a wave. Cockiness that is really confidence. This is a man who really likes himself, and has surfed a lot. I don't understand surfing and at the same time I am completely drawn to it and the lifestyle. I imagine that this is because it will always be a little mysterious to me. I grew up landlocked and I have a respectful fear of the ocean. Surfing will always be elusive to me. I think I like it that way.  Rahsaan and I drove up north last night to spend a few days with Cyber Sam and Wry Bread at Sam's house, in the woods near Point Arena. He was taking me to the doctor for my first post-op check-up on Monday, when he got the call from Rye Bread that the surf was too good to pass up, so Raz said he was going up there later in the day. Well, since I was right there, I asked if I could tag along, and to my mild suprize, he said sure. It would be a welcome break for me since I've been confined to my house for the last week due to having surgery on both my feet.   Sometimes I look down at my boots, and I'm still amazed that I actually did it. It was a really tough decision to make, to get both my feet fixed at the same time, and choose to have a doctor cut me open and go deep through everything inside my foot, down to the bone, and cut it apart, move it over, put pins in my toes and shave my bones down smooth. In fact, I had said many times, I want to go to my grave without ever getting cut. Well, I changed my mind. And I was really scared.  But I had to have faith. I had to put most of it in the doctors hands. The rest I had to have in the universe, and in God, and in me, that this was the right thing to do. I asked a lot of people their opinion. I did a lot of research. I talked to a woman who had the same procedure done only six weeks before. Finally, it took the blessing of my mom that made it all okay, and for me to move forward and do it. I know, I'm old enough to make my own decisions, but there was something about what my mom thought about it that was important to me. At first, she didn't think it was necessary. And then, after she had thought about it more, and then actually saw my poor, deformed feet, that she said you know, you should do it. I scheduled my surgery the next day.  Well, the surgery went extremely well, and I've been healing at warp speed, just like I thought I would. I went for my first checkup yesterday and got some big thumbs up and some new bandages. I saw my new feet for the first time, bruised and swollen, but they already looked beautiful. Since I was feeling so well, I decided that a little break out of town would be fine. So here I am, sitting on this windy, rocky beach, in my big blue and grey ski boots, freezing my ass off and watching the boys surf.  2  It's been a great day so far. We woke up nice and late in the Cyberbus, me in the back and Rahsaan in the front. I finally got up a little after Raz did and wandered into the house for some coffee and pancakes. They eventually got the van packed with their surf gear, smoked a bowl, and drove to the cove.  But today I'm a little mixed up. See, yesterday, right after we made plans to come out here together for a few days, Raz laid it out on the table and told me that he couldn't see me anymore except as just friends. That he was torn up about being with me when he has a girlfriend. And I understood. In fact, I expected it, in a way. But I was really, really disappointed. I like him a lot and I could easly see how good we are together, and how great we could be together. There's a sense of comfort I get with him, and at the same time, a sense of  excitement. He's sweet and considerate and has just enought element of asshole but is outweighted by his charm and sense of fun and just being kind... and he's got a smile that turns me into a puddle every time he flashes it at me. He makes me feel unworthy. He's a big softie under that dude exterior, and he's also a guy who follows through with his commitments and whose intentions are good. Not only that, but I'm so hot for him that sometimes when I look at him, the entire world falls away for just a spit second.    But of course, since he has a girlfriend, who is very far away - in the Carribean - he has a wall around him. Somehow I managed to penetrate that wall on more than one occasion, but it went right back up when we returned into the world outside of the one we made, however small and new, and he had a chance to think of the big picture again. So I sort of knew that it wasn't going to just come to me that easy. But it was there and he was participating.  Anyway, my instinct was right. After my doctor's apointment, before we went up north, we drove to the Arboretum in Golden Gate Park and got out and looked at the chrysanthemums in the side garden. That's when he said we had to have a talk. He said his head was splitting over being wiht me and having a girlfriend. He didn't want to do this to me, to her, or to himself. And that we had to start being friends without being lovers. That he really intended to leave it on the playa that weekend. But that he doesn't know why he kept seeing me afterward, but he did. And that he can't do it anymore.  I told him I understood - and I really did - but it wasn't what I was hoping to hear from him. But there it is. Deal with it.  Well, I told him it would be hard to help him be good, and that I surely wouldn't try to seduce him, but if he chose to come to me I probably wouldn't turn him down. That I would try to be supportive as much as I was capable. And that was the honest truth. But because I wanted to be with him so much, it would be a conflict of interest. He accepted that.  He dropped me off at my house for a few hours  and he went to his place, so we could both get packed, and then rounded me up again at dark. We smoked a joint as we drove up to Point Arena, and drank five beers between us. Usually I would protest, but for some reason, I was with Rahsaan and it was all good. I don't know why it was like that. But it made the journey a lot more fun. Near the end of the trip, he turned off into a small vista point and got out to smell the ocean and have a smoke before we got to Sam's house. It was cold, and all the stars in the sky were out shining brightly and filling in all the black spaces with twinkles of light. As I stood there, I got an overwhelming desire to touch him and show him some affection. It was just one of those moments. As I leaned in and kissed his cheek, he said, only friendly kisses now, and pulled away.  Well, I got it. I was completely deflated. I got in the car and sulked a little... but then realized that I had more to gain by being cool and putting his needs and desires before mine, in the name of friendship. Not just our friendship, but all the other friendships I have started and want to forge among his group of friends, Belva's group, the fourth of July group that witnessed the whole thing. So I sat there and I sucked it up.  We got to Sam's, and Rahsaan started getting our beds set up. We were going to sleep in the Cyberbuss. I chose the bed in the back, Rahsaan took the bed in the front. We brushed our teeth and arranged our nests, drank some water and took our last pee. I was ready to lay my head down, when I called over to him. Can I have a kiss goodnight? He came over. He leaned down and kisssed me. Just a sweet soft smack of a kiss. And he lingered. He kissed me again. And then again. And then, a full body, full mouth kiss... and then it began. The energy between us shifted and we were back in the swirl of that incredible, sensual, sexual draw we have between us. He didn't go away. And I made no attempts to help him stop. Before I knew it, we were making noises again. Passionate, loving, deep, pleasure noises that I had just resigned to not ever having with him again. I was on top of the world - not just because he giving me orgasm after deep orgasm, but because I wanted to be that close to him and his energy. I wanted to love him. And he seemed to be letting me.  At the same time, all of it confused me. Was I stupid to go there and risk getting more hurt? Or to risk having him resent me for letting him go too far? Or was he doing what he really wanted to do and  I should let him go where his heart takes him? Or was he just following his cock? I know he is torn inside because he really likes me and what I'm about, and he has told me so, but the fact remains that he's spoken for. He admitted that after sleeping with me, he knew if he continued to see me that it... I filled in the blanks as best I could and figured that he was probably afraid that he would grow feelings for me, over time, and then it would be even harder to deal with. He told me that he would have to come clean with his girlfriend about his fling with me, and he doesn't know how that might change things. Not that he wants to change things, but that the reality of it is that things might now change for him. And because I know this, knew it in my heart, can feel change coming for both of us - I can't find it in me to stop believing that there's a possibility for us to be together somewhere down the road. That's why I'm letting him do what he chooses. I guess because I want him to choose me. I know my motives are selfish. But I can't do anything else.  Ha. This polyanna will always have a bottomless well of hope.

      Today I woke up pissed. Not drunk, if you're an anglophile, but angry. I was angry at one of my dearest friends, Ron. I called him last night and left a message, asking if he knows anything about COBRA, since I'm going to be leaving my job soon and I should keep my health insurance due to having my feet done so recently. It's just a good idea in general to have health insurance anyway, especially at my age when things start to break, and someday I'll probably want to get pregnant. He left a message last night, saying that he didn't know much about COBRA... and to not be hasty about quitting my job.  That's what pissed me off. I am quitting my job. I have been planning to do this since March.  I have been talking about this for six months. I am not going to not do this. I will be giving my two weeks notice to my department in less than a week. I am comitted to moving on - I am excited about it, I am scared to death of it, I have been encouraged by my friends and the universe in unexpected and beautiful ways. I am going to do this. I have been wanting to end my corporate sentence almost since the day that I filled out my W-4 and gave it to HR. But to reach the point where I am ready to dismiss the secure warmth of this job has been an excercise in courage and faith. It is essential that those around me be positive, and supportive, and help me along this path with their good wishes. It wouldn't take much to knock me down and scare me into staying. So I decided, after hearing the message, that I couldn't talk to him until after I had made the transition.  It's not his fault. He is a sextegenarian, a very cool one at that, but still a subscriber to the Old Way of thinking. He and my Mom. She's another one I can't discuss this with. I have been explaining this to them for months now, and still, neither one of them is on board. I really really need them to support me, two of the most important people in my life - but instead they have consistently discouraged me and made my mood sour. It made me mad. But then I realized that it's all they know, that they can't see  the real opportunity I'm creating for myself, my desire to be happy and excited on a daily basis, and my  desperate need forroom to grow as an artist.  My younger friends can. Especially those who understand and appreciate my talents. Ron, as much as he loves me, has never had much faith in my ability as an artist. He has always seen me as a little bit less than what I am, and I have no idea why. But I have never been able to count on him to put out the good word for me in terms of business. And sometimes that hurts.   But when I put it into perspective, I can see that his opinion on the subject is only one of dozens, and not shared by anyone but maybe my mom. My other friends and associates see me as wonderful, talented artist, and they tell me so, unprovoked, all the time. I have been recieving e-mails from all over the country, random e-mails from people I do not know, sending me accolades on my photography. This has been entirely unexpected. My photography. What's ironic is that I consider myself an illustrator, not a photographer. But the compliments they send me are for my pictures.  I started shooting a few years ago, when I got my first digital camera. Taking lots of pictures suddenly became affordable. Actually, it became free. I already had all the computer hardware and software in place, all I had to do was shoot, transfer, and edit. I have gotten so much joy from taking pictures. It's what I do when I have time to goof off. The things that I see in the world are so interesting and gorgeous, it often takes my breath away. All I'm doing is taking a visual note, and sharing it. I had no idea my pictures would be so well-recieved. But they are, and I'm rolling around in it like a dog in the dirt.  That's just one of about eight or nine different avenues I'm going to take once I'm freed. My creativity is surging and almost making me nuts, since right now it has so few outlets. I don't have the time. I can't have a full-time job plus a two-hour commute every day and expect to take all these ideas and birth them and watch them grow. I've tried desperately to do that for three years.  When I do try to do my art, after work and on the weekends, it's like hiking uphill with an 80-pound backpack when I'm hungry, cold, tired, and I have to pee. It sucks. I just can't do it and give myself a fair chance to do it right - or even enjoy it.  Making art and expressing myself should be fun! But it's not, it's just another gruelling task. Do I want my life to be like this? HELL no.  So, I'm clearing all the branches from my path, putting my helmet on, and getting ready to hold on tight for the wild ride that is ahead. I know it's going to be awesome. I know it's going ot be a lot of work. I could not be more ready in my heart and in my mind. And the perfect way to start the whole thing is with my extended family, for one week, in the middle of fucking nowhere in a city that will spring up out of the ground like a mirage. I think there's going to be a big bonfire, too.  b
