       Today, I will juz concentrate only taking abt my Philyouth Practice.  Have to meet with my friends at Kallang MRT Control Station at 1300 but I was late lah. Then we have our lunch together at Mac. Funny thing is that when I enter Mac I saw them laughing at me. Therefore making me so embrassed. Haha! But actually they wanna guess what I'm wearing for the practice. Some say "Hong Ghee will fold up his sleeve as he always like to do that. He will also wear red, yellow, black, etc... colours of clothes". But they all guess wrong. Thus, they are laughing at themselves only. Haha!  During practice, juz try some piece like 'Third March', 'Ghost Train', etc.... Esp the Ghost Train is so the eeriee when we played.  After practice have dinner lol. Ate some KFCs then chitchat and laugh lol. Then went back. Haha!  K, ending here for today. Bye! & thanks for reading my blog. :)
