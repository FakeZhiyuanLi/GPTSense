       When I was a little girl the one thing that I would do often was skin my knees.  I would fall while riding my bike or climb a tree and scrape my knee against the trunk.  My dad would be disappointed and tell me that I should be more careful because scars don’t look good.  One day, I climbed up onto a large boulder and slipped off.  I scrapped up my elbows and knees pretty bad.  I didn’t want my parents to know so I ran home and cleaned it up on my own.  It hurt really badly and there was no one there to comfort me while I was trying to clean up the wound.  I spent the next few days hiding my wound.  I wore long sleeve shirts and pants.  Both would scratch up the wound even more, but I was determined not to show that I had fallen again.  I didn’t want to disappoint anyone.  Eventually, my mom noticed the blood on my clothes and asked me about it.  When I looked down at the scrapes they looked as if I had just fallen.  She took me into the bathroom and started to clean out what I had missed.  It seemed to hurt worse than before, but she held my hand and hugged me on occasion.  She put some ointment on it and bandages it up.  A few days later I barely noticed the scrapes.   It’s interesting how sometimes we fall and try to clean up our own wounds.  We hide them because we feel as if we’ve failed somehow.  We feel almost shameful of them, but they continue to surface until we finally realize that we aren’t meant to heal ourselves.  Psalm 139 says, “O Lord, you have searched me and you know me.  You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar.  You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways…”  And He knows our hurts…He sees our wounds even when we hide them and He loves us through each hurt.  Brennan Manning wrote, “Jesus knows what hurts us.  Not only knows but, knowing, seeks us out – whatever our kind of poverty or pain, however we weep, wherever we feel unloved.”  As I walk through these days with surfacing wounds, I pray that you all know, through God healing can happen.  As much as each surfacing wound brings about hurt…with it comes healing.

      "Watch over your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life." [Proverbs 4.23]  I have been thinking a great deal about the heart lately, specifically, my own heart.  I've been asking the question of where my heart is...what truly inhabits it?  I have to be honest in that tonight, you will find a whole lot of crap.  You see, I spent part of the evening venting about all the annoyances of this summer and for a small amount of time, it felt good.  Then something happened.  It's that thing that happens to all of us when we've realized how much crap came from inside us.  The other day, I sat with my grandmother.  She fell and broke her hip, so they had to replace a disk.  I held her hand while they were turning her to one side.  She squeezed it tight.  I looked down at her hand holding mine.  In that moment in time, God jolted me back to His "ultimate reality."  You see, my grandmother is this extraordinary woman.  She lost her mother at a young age, was adopted by her father's new wife, married, had thirteen children, was left by her husband to fend for herself and her children, and managed to live to the age of 86 with a legacy of her faith.  Out of her heart, came unto each of her children and grandchildren a sense of gratefulness.  Tonight, out of mine, came a sense of selfish pride and intolerance.  Every word continues to echo inside my mind as I try to hard to erase each item...  For some reason, God has decided to bring me to a place where I can sit with students and friends in their quest for Him.  I get the opportunity to listen to people's hearts.  What I'm learning is that out of that, He is also revealing to me the interworkings of my own.  It's not pretty, but He's working on it.  "Therefore we must understand that spiritual formation is not only formation of the Spirit or inner being of the individual, though that is both the process and the outcome.  It is also formation by the Spirit of God and by the spiritual riches of Christ's continuing incarnation in his people - including, most prominently, the treasures of his written and spoken word and the amazing personalities of those in whom he has most fully lived." [Dallas Willard,  Renovations of the Heart ]

        Blonde Joke With A Twist           A blonde walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer. She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce. The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there.  Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, "Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?"       The blonde replies....."Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"

        Paul Tillich,  The Shaking of the Foundations :        Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness. It strikes us when we walk through the dark valley of a meaningless and empty life...it strikes us when, year after year, the longed-for perfection does not appear, when the old compulsions reign within us as they have for decades, when despair destroys all joy and courage. Sometimes at that moment a wave of light breaks into our darkness, and it is as though a voice were saying, "You are accpeted. You are accepted, accepted that by which is greater than you, and the name of which you do not know. Do not ask for that name now; perhaps you will find it later. Do not try to do anything now; perhaps later you will do much. Do not seek for anythin, do not perfomr anything, do not intend anything. Simply accept the fact that you are accepted." If that happens to us, we experience grace.

      I was driving in to work this morning and noticed a bumper sticker on the car infront of me.  It said, "God bless America."  I wonder what that means.  Do we want God to "bless" us with prosperity, security, and power? Or are we truly asking for God to bless us the way He wants to?   How does God "bless" America?

       When I was a little girl I decided to take on the violin as a new instrument. So I begged and pleaded for my parents to let me play. I made promise after promise and convinced them that playing the violin would make my life complete. Either they believed me at some point or got sick of my pleadings, but they broke down. We went to the music store and purchased a brand new $300 instrument. All that I had said was true...for a good year or so. I played that instrument day in and day out, but my little mind wanted something more.  Last Sunday night, I went to Rock Harbor church in Costa Mesa where the main message went through the seventh commandment (isn't it interesting how we number the commandments), "thou shalt not commit adultery." The message geared into the direction of lust and what struck me about it was that it brought out three points: lust is never satisfied, it takes away from legitimate desires, and it imprisons. The point that really stuck out to me was the first.  I think, often, Christians, talk about how God fulfills every need...He is everything and completes us, but I wonder how much that is lived out. I wonder how much we actually allow for God to fulfill, whether that fulfillment comes from people around us or His own provisions...or are we convinced that we know what fulfills us?  When I was a little girl, I was convinced that it was the violin...now that instrument sits in a garage somwhere, untouched, unplayed...when I look back, I know there are many things in my life that I have left untouched and unplayed...I wonder what it would have been like if I trusted that God would provide the more that I searched for. I often wonder how I would have enjoyed playing the violin today.
