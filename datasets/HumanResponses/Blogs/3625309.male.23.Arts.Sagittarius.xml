      Honestly...if anyone would have told me in like 5th grade that there was even the remote possibility that I would be the inhabitant of my very own cubicle, I probably would have run away from home!!  Its so sad to work with all these people that on there lunch break tell me that they used to be like me!  WHAT???!!!  That they used to have dreams and visions and all have college degrees, but then got there day job, and 25 years later, they've maybe gotten a 5 dollar raise, some extra vacation time, and definitely gained about 65lbs.  If the words, "I'm really starting to like this place" ever come out of my mouth, I beg anyone thats my friend or values me in any way, to please run me over with there car!  Anyways...enough about that.  had a great weekend at least.  Jimmy and I did some hella volunteering for outfront MN and got tons of people registered to vote, and SO many petitions signed.  Its too bad none of our friends showed up to support or help, but my little sister did and so did her best friend and they fuckin ROCKED!!!  Its so excited to see that kids in highschool are different today then they were when I was growing up.  I'm so proud of the fact that they can actually be themselves and grow up comfortable in there own skin!  Maybe despite all the shit thats going on in the political world, the real world is actually advancing.  Its totally time for me to lay down in my bed and pretend that tomorrow I'm going to wake up a toymaker, or an 80's rock star.  LATER BLOGGER!!!

      So last night Jimmy and I ventured out into the straight world...not only the straight world...the straight up white trash world of wrestling.  At first I thought that I was too tired to go...but then I got there and my life changed!!!  It was the most amazing thing i have ever seen in my life!!!  Have you ever seen a toothless, mullet sporting hick, in cutoff wrangler jeanshorts and a wife beater, DIVE to catch pieces of a keyboard that had just begen smashed across the back of a sweaty 400lb man...because I have, and I am so proud of that!!!  Plus it was a huge reunion between me and a bunch of my old friends from joes crab shack...$1.75 miller highlife taps all night...AHHHH...so freakin amazing.  Plus Jimmy and I had the best night ever!!  I'm so stupid for being scared about that damn roadtrip.  Things have changed for the better and I couldn't be happier right now!!  Tonight we're going to an idependant film debut, called brother to brother, and we're doing more volunteering for outfront MN, to get people registered to vote and to sign petitions about the gay rights amendments that are still trying to be passed.  Its so nice to fight for your rights, sitting along side of the person that you're fighting just as hard for!  ok my computer is really starting to piss me off so this blog is for sure ending now. HOLLAH!!

      So my boyfriend, of over a year now, is somewhere on his way back from Kentucky right now.  He took the weekend to get away, and anytime now he's going to be back.  I'm scared.  He needed this weekend so much, as did I, to just do something.  I just wish we could have done something together!  I'm one of those people that just can't get enough of other people.  I try as hard as possible to not get clingy and over attached, but man is it hard. And when I love someone...I LOVE someone.  I've never loved anyone in my life the way I love my boyfriend.  Since day one I just knew that I wanted to spend my life with him, and with each day, I think I'm making it more difficult for that to be a reality.  He needs so much space, and I honestly feel like I give it to him, but I guess I dont give him enough.  I can tell when there are times that all he wants to do is get away, or have me go away...and that pushes me even harder to get that much closer, which in turns pisses him off etc etc.  How do I go about loving a person so much without smothering the hell out of them, and without giving them so much space that we eventually just drift apart???  He said this weekend was exactly what he needed, and that he thought that it was really going to help us.  I really hope so.  Jimmy, I missed you so much this weekend, and I really hope that we can get back on the right track.  I'm really going to try this time to give you what you need, whether its space or understanding, please dont give up on me!!  I love you!

      Supposedly blogging is supposed to be easier than keeping a journal, because your hand can't cramp up as bad.  Just checkin it out...and its pretty nice.  Pretty boring so far, but maybe the excitement of it all just has to settle in.

      Yes, its true, no one puts it quite as eloquently as Jessie from the ever so popular, early 90's hit TV show!  I just put in my 2 weeks at my horrid day job today...and they have given me the option of just going home TONIGHT!  I already have a job and few auditions lined up so I really have no worries, but all of a sudden my stomach is in knots and I'm freakin out.  But seriously, I could go home tonight and never have to call and hastle another dying person again! oh yeah..I totally forgot that my blog hasnt been working lately.  I work for a big hospital in the twin cities, as a trained collections coordinator, which in short means I call people and tell them how delinquent they are on their medical bills, demand they pay, then send them straight to collections if they dont!  its the absolute worst!  if nothing was ever driving me to drink in the past, this is doing it to me now!  but I got my old job back as a server/bartender working with all my old friends and I start this friday!  Life is just going to feel so much easier when I am A) not on the 9-5 schedule anymore, and B) helping people choose a dessert, rather than choose a payment plan that doesnt put them directly into bankruptcy!  plus I'm auditioning for a national tour this weekend!  Life's totally getting better, at least on a real basic level...you gotta start somewhere!  HOLLAH!

      My job doesnt allow me to post extensive blogs, so I'm going to summarize.  Do you ever have one of those long conversations, that afterwards you feel totally uplifted, and kind of invincible...totally had one of those last night...it was really exciting, really inspiring, and its been my motivation to get through the longest friday of my life!  Plus the fact that I'm going up north for the fourth (that rhymes) and its going to ROCK MY FREAKIN WORLD!  I turn into a 6 yr old boy at best when it comes to lighting fire works, and I am seriously drooling at the thought of doing nothing but setting off the firey wonderousness all weekend long!  YAY!  ok, back to work braddy out
