      In Bush We Trust?    John Moyers is Editor-in-Chief of TomPaine.com.   George W. Bush is a liar. There, I said it -- the "L" word. Someone in Washington had to.   Thanks to AWOL WMD, people all across America have the "L" word on their lips, but here in D.C. it's still a hard one to mouth. Few Washington-based commentators and fewer politicians have done so.   On Sunday, June 22, The New York Times had a chance to be the first big-league outfit to say it plainly. But the headline on Washington-based reporter David E. Rosenbaum's story, "Bush May Have Exaggerated, but Did He Lie?" was a tip that the story would pull up short. Rosenbaum considered a narrow question -- whether Mr. Bush has told any neat, tidy, obvious lies -- and concluded he has not (a couple of fibs and distortions, maybe, but no lies).   Whether the president twisted intelligence on WMD "can probably be answered conclusively only by historians when all the evidence and consequences are known," Rosenbaum wrote. (So, our kids get to pay the debt for our imperial aspirations and our tax breaks, and someday they'll be the first to know how it all happened. Great.)   Distance seems to make criticism easier. The Times' Princeton-based columnist Paul Krugman has written that the administration "systematically and brazenly distorts the facts" and is "choosing and exaggerating intelligence" and "misleading the public."   Close, but still no "L" word.   Boston-based William Rivers Pitt isn't daunted: The administration "lied us into a war," writes the high-school teacher who moonlights as a columnist for Truthout.org. "Trust a teacher on this. We can spot liars who have not done their homework a mile away."   A full-page ad in The New York Times last week by MoveOn.org and Win Without War, groups with members across the nation, put it plainly and hoisted the president on his own pointed WMD -- words of mass distortion. Under the headline "MISLEADER" the ad stacked up five of Mr. Bush's pre-war whoppers and noted, "It would be a tragedy if young men and women were sent to die for a lie." (Full disclosure: TomPaine.com liked the ad so much, we paid to run it in the June 30 issue of The Weekly Standard.)   Harley Sorensen, writing on SFGate.com, gets the prize for directness: "Why mince words? These are the facts: 1) President George W. Bush is a liar. 2) Secretary of State Colin Powell is a liar. 3) Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is a liar. 4) National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice is a liar." No mincing there.   So the word is out there in different forms -- lie, lies, lying, liar. When will Mr. Bush's putative opponents in government, the Democrats, decide it's time to tell it like it is?   Democrats have accused the president of "a pattern of deception and deceit" (Sen. Bob Graham), said he's not been "entirely truthful" (Howard Dean), and led us to war based on "unfounded assertions" (Rep. Dennis Kucinich). Strong stuff, but no "L" word.   Opposition worthy of the name would push the GOP-controlled House and Senate hearings beyond the question of what the intelligence community knew about WMD, where it seems stalled.   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, could invoke committee rules that would allow his minority party to launch a full investigation. But he won't -- reportedly for fear of being seen as partisan.   If this isn't the time for partisanship -- after all, we're talking about manipulations that led the nation into war -- when is? Rockefeller's timidity is allowing committee Republicans to cover what looks more every day like a lie of literally global magnitude.   Perhaps Dems fear the day when WMD are found (and they will be found, by hook or by crook). But they needn't worry -- even if misleading the nation to war weren't an issue, Mr. Bush's record is full of lies.   The president says he supports our troops -- but he proposed cutting veterans' benefits and sidestepped a law meant to protect the health of soldiers headed for combat. His "leave no child behind" pledge is a fraud -- he's vastly underfunded his own education plan, and he signed the recent tax bill even after his GOP minions sneakily removed provisions benefiting low-income families. Mr. Bush says he's a "compassionate conservative," but only a hard-hearted radical would push his Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax policies. He says he wants to expand national service programs, but he's presiding over a huge cut in AmeriCorps programs. Candidate Bush promised to be "a uniter, not a divider," but his foreign policies have profoundly divided the international community, isolated America and devalued her stock in the eyes of world.   Mr. Bush's administration is built on lies, which means the granddaddy of them all is his promise to restore "honor and integrity" to the Oval Office.   Presidential Brain Karl Rove must be worried. Rove knows that any president's popularity rests more on whether voters think he's a believable and admirable leader than on the substance of issues. George W. Bush has that going for him -- people might not like his policies (if they understand them at all), but they like his swagger and certitude, and they trust him to do what he says.   But that trust could crumble if questions linger about whether the White House deceived us into war. Few of the president's allies could or would defend that -- even GOP-TV (a.k.a. Fox News) would have trouble explaining away that one.

      Opening up with these excellent quotes from our dear friend, Ann Coulter:  [more in-depth attacks on Coulter later today, I promise]  This is all from her new book, Treason. By the way, I'm firmly convinced that it should be considered treason to write this kind of filth.  "Ashcroft has been incessantly attacked on the op-ed page of the New York Times by the same columnists who are now angrily demanding to know why the Bush administration didn't imprison all Arabs before Sept. 11. He has been compared to the Taliban. (And you're not a patriot in this war until a liberal has compared you to the Taliban.)"  "Like everything liberals oppose but don't have a good argument for, all reasonable national security measures are called "unconstitutional." Whenever liberals are losing on substance, they pretend to be upset about process."  "While undermining victory in the Cold War, liberals dedicated themselves to mainstreaming Communist ideals at home... Betraying the manifest national defense objectives of the country is only part of the left's treasonous scheme. They aim to destroy America from the inside with their relentless attacks on morality and the truth. (p. 289)"  Oh, yeah. Let's destroy America! Hey, people! Where are your liberal grenades? WHAT?! You lent them to HALLIBURTON?!!  "Whether they are defending the Soviet Union or bleating for Saddam Hussein, liberals are always against America. They are either traitors or idiots, and on the matter of America's self-preservation, the difference is irrelevant. Fifty years of treason hasn't slowed them down. (p. 16)"  Fifty years of Treason? If treason includes making sure that a bunch of fat pot bellied men don't take over the world, then bring treason on! *snorts* MANIFEST NATIONAL DEFENSE OBJECTIVES, indeed.  "McCarthy's fundamental thesis was absolutely correct: The Democratic Party had fallen to the allures of totalitarianism. It was as if the Republicans had been caught in bed with Hitler. (p. 71)"  Now we get to my favorite part here; this is where Ann Coulter idolizes McCarthy. This is the same bastard who ruined thousands of lives and kind of ruined the country, but he wasn't a liberal! He must be great! Bitch! How DARE she?!  "When the Democrats' bluff was called in a roll call vote in Congress, many voted for war with Iraq. Inadvertently performing a great service, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd revealed the Democrats' treasonous calculations. She explained that Democrats would be forced to fake enthusiasm for the war on terror or lose the American people forever. Democrats, she said, "fear that if they approach" Iraq the same way they did during the Gulf War in 1991, "they will be portrayed as McGovernite wimps." Consequently, liberals would lie and pretend to support America. With their votes duly recorded, they went right back to attacking the war. (p. 14-15)"  While Maureen Dowd is not the nicest person in the world, I have yet to see her condemn every conservative in the world as having committed treason. Dowd might be petty, but there is a line where she stops and rarely crosses. Coulter on the other hand, has no problem discrediting actual achievements of people based solely on the fact that she does not LIKE them, as can be seen here:  "Carter would travel to Norway to accept the award in December 2002 - two months after Congress had authorized war against Iraq. Article III's definition of treason is narrow. But after Congress's action authorizing war, for any American to accept this award on the ground offered does sound terribly like "adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort." (p. 257)"  Yes. Carter has actually helped people and done more than you ever have to help anyone else. Carter has saved lives, and Coulter has caused grief. Let's see. Who's the better person? I'm thinking here -  Oh, Clod. She is, indeed, a horrible person.

       Ok ... so here it goes. Icenhower was talking to me ... and she goes, shaking her head, "Sreya ... I just got the grades ... they're terrible! What are you doing with yourself! I can't believe this ... you KNOW colleges see your final transcripts ... "  But on a funnier note, Colella and Connolly were talking and Colella goes, "Ever since she got in to college she's been ... phew! Forgetting homeworks left and right!"  "Well," Connolly goes, "She must have been really smart. The way she acted in my class, she got accepted as a freshman!"

       I am afraid of failing Biology. I am also equally afraid of failing Calculus. Whatever I get in either of those classes should not matter because I'm going to retake them either in college, or in the case of the hated Calculus, I will be taking it over the summer.  What will happen if Rutgers rescinds my offer of admission:  1. I will be disowned. 2. I will be without a roommate. 3. Sarah will hate me for life. 4. I will be nothing, and nobody. 5. It won't matter because I am dead.  There seem to be no pros to this situation, so we'll all move on.  What I need to do:  (It's too late to accept anything but the usual F on my next bio thing. But I can complete the worksheets and make an attempt to BS stuff. The worksheets might also help me study. Count on me being up until a really hellish hour.)  I have also written the world's crappiest poem. And afterward, I think that I should eat cheese. Yes. Cheese. Moving On ...

       I am stuck on the plot for Sanguine Fortress. Every problem I solve creates a new one. Did you know that this hunk of junk is the largest project I have ever attempted? I won't say more than that ... I'd jinx myself.  What was today? (Two Ap exams in a row, pizza, gerbils and a very wise saying.) Samantha Figueroa asked me what I wanted to do in Spanish class yesterday, and I told her I want to make it possible for more Americans to have health insurance.  So she said to me, "I don't know what you feel about what's up there ... but you know, you'd get mad points with him." And that got me thinking more than anything else ... is there a God? I honestly don't know what to think anymore. I'm so FRIED.  Anyway ... everytime I write SF I feel better, although it's thoroughly depressing at the same time. So I'm going to keep going. And hopefully, sometime, I can read my work and say, "Well ... I've gotten a damn sight better since then."
