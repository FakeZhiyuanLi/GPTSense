      met up with my sup on thurs....everything seems ok......just that my results are not 'correct'! anyway he did say 'Good!' once........although i'm not sure if he really meant it. hopefully can find the bug that is causing the logic error and hopefully have better results. driving on fri was ok....think i have a better sense of the car's dimensions....but still can improve. knocked down the pole during parallel pole......shucks first time i did that......tot can keep a clean sheet.  bought a new game....battlefield 1942......it's awesome.....the very big map plus u can control vehicles as well, plus of course the usual cs weapons. also have medic.....interesting though not that useful in single player games.  sat played pool with ed and coy. haiz not much improvement...when i try to concentrate on placing the white ball.....the potting is lousy. when i try to pot...then the placing is like shit. not easy as i thought......definitely needs a lot of practice.

      wow a week has past.....well funkamania last friday was not up to expectations. non of the groups really 'wowed' me....the best was KR dancers, for their humour and 'glow-in-the-dark' costumes....very innovative indeed. i think funk dancing shouldn't just be fast movements...there should be slow movements now and then....to emphasize the fast parts. if not everything will seem quite monotonous....and positioning and coordination is very important. if all the dancers move, dance together and in orderly manner....any move will look great. there should also be some interaction between dancers....not that impt though.  went to play badminton with oak3 ppl on saturday. i was quite surprised sj sms me the day b4....for some small chat. i can't help but wonder why she's available on saturday to play badminton....shld be going out with her bf. i was more surprised when she said she's sick on sat....tot staying at home would be wiser. anyway was glad she was there.... the question mark over her current status keeps bothering me till now...most probably her bf is on overseas attachment. yah one more thing.....she looks great when just waking up....  watched hero with the usual movie gang....it was a little bit below my expectations but...the story is quite interesting. the fighting scenes are beautiful....not very exciting...just nice to watch. now looking forward to the matrix sequels....oh ya.....actually got a free chicken sandwich during the show as i was informed last minute abt the show. hmmm perhaps shld act blur the next time..then can get free meal....

      wed's driving lesson: keep close to the line before changing lane...that conveys the intention of changing lanes. i kept forgetting abt that one. then at evening time went for mel's bday celebration at fish and co. wow the fish and chips serving was huge....i was really full at the end. well the funny part was that cindy got a stool for mel....low cost due to the poor economy. then all of us wrote our bday greetings on the stool. oso the restaurant's staff made mel stood on a chair b4 we sang the bday song...quite embarassing for him. during dinner heard alot of comments abt IA....well seems that certain things dun change...

      went to sch of computing for OS first lecture...quite blur...was late as well so dunno how to register modules. but saw quite a few chiobus of SoC...hmmm something diff compared to our lectures. haiz still can't make up my mind what to take. think os gonna be quiet time-consuming but it's related to embedded systems and i'm interested in knowing more abt that. think will make decision after going thru all the lectures this wk. mel bday tmr and going to celebrate at ex-tgif...dint know where that was at first. now birthdays more low-key liao...maybe ppl are short of money to buy presents. anyway it's good enough that oak3 have kept the tradition alive for so long liao..think abt 1 and 1/2 yrs.  went to the astar website and saw some interesting stuff related to my future career. still dunno if research is the type of job for me....think i'm more a hands-on person. but seems that govt is pushing very hard for higher degrees and research. think may not be too difficult to get a scholarship for master or phd....but then i dunno whether i can do research or not.

      first day of the last semester in sch...sianz. went to cn2 first lecture...realized there's a project worth 40% to be done...related to sockets programming. sounds interesting and challenging but tough too. tot some of my former classmates will be taking them but some went off during the break and some told me they not taking the module after the lecture. haiz...no kaki for the project. may also be good...the project may turn out to be too tough in the end. but not many choices left...planned to take 3 modules but looks like only 2 left....still have os and vlsi...hope they are easy modules....at least not tough ones.

      sat nite met up with wf, zx, qh, yz and jf to have dinner at the ultra ex crystal jade kitchen at taka. but jf, who's back from his overseas attachment, was generous enough to subsidise 20 bucks for the rest of us. he earning big bucks overseas i believe. the service was quite lousy...we 6 ppl had to cramp into a table meant for 4...but the food was good, albeit a tad too expensive for students. after that it was warcraft time at far east building...the most 'ulu' lan game centre and billiards centre u can find in orchard. it was quite fun...pairing up with qh and beating the rest...haha...but then 2 of them are beginners so we were accused of bullying. then we play card games at the least expected place...inside orchard mrt. through playing 'bluff' we realised that zx never lies...even when the game demands it. later we played hearts...not bad coz i learnt a new card game.  sun morning's soccer session was good. we discovered a new basketball court inside chong boon secondary sch. it was fenced up and the ground surface is good. the only problem was that.....it was DAMN HOT!!.. there's no shelter and with the 12pm sun scorching...it feels like playing in the Sahara desert...but overall it's good..we had the whole court to ourselves. then after soccer went to zr's cousin's hse for swimming. actually not swimming...just soaking in the water but there's a pool that can produce jets of water for messaging. it's really good...especially after a tiring workout...it's powerful enough so the messaging effect is there. definitely shiok....to top all that up....a nice cosy late afternoon nap at my king size bed...BEST!!!

      well after some experimenting with the blogger interface...finally my first attempt at blogging is successful!! still in the midst of figuring out why would people want to write their everyday life and thoughts and opinions for all to see. I have seen some and wow...i was quite surprised at the frankness of some. hmmm...guess i have to give it a try to see just what the appeal is. anyway dun think i will have the discipline to stick with the routine of weblogging.  anyway to know more abt me just go to my homepage...that's all for now. btw am i writing for myself or for the reading pleasure of someone else? i haven't really tried writing a journal so it kinda feels strange.

      watched the sheares hall production on friday......except for the sexy gals on the show.....it was total crap.....the only redeeming thing was that there were gals wearing some skimpy outfits.....the songs sucked....so does some of the acting......  starting to feel the stress from the fyp project....presenting in about a weeks times. might as well also......do a final report and ppt then just need to present again to the examiner.....  really sick of the project now.....dunno if it's me or the subject matter but......research seems boring. the past few days have been running simulations....it's amazing my computer can withstand all the processing. hopefully it doesn't crash.....can crash after ca4.....  haiz just wanna get past march......onto april and it's left only the exams......  finally graduating soon.....i wonder the feeling that i will have after my last paper.....

      wow a week has past....quite a hectic week of fyp simulations at home. actually my computer is more overworked than me. seems like my supervisor is stepping up the gear already....starting to feel a bit stressed. he is still not satisfied with the results. i think they are ok oredi....given that the original approach is already good enough.   then the bloody driving test oso coming soon...shucks seems like everything all packed onto march. plus all the other modules assignments....term papers....tests and all that stuff....march is gonna be hard to bear man. still gonna send resumes and hope to find a job! wakau...cannot tahan liao....  hopefully can take things one at a time and finish everything on time.....haiz....engineering course so....prepare to slog for 4 yrs....which is very true....never believe my seniors but now realise it's the truth.

      haiz......did nothing for her during vday. actually was ready to carry out the plan on vday morning....roses and the mp3 cd. but met her online on thurs nite and.....somehow i feel the pressure to ask her out for dinner. she said she didn't have presents and no dates...which surprised me actually. then kenna rejected. at first she seems undecided...but then at last it was a firm no. haiz....she oso mentioned something abt leading ppl on. oops...is she implying that she is leading me on? and the prevent further misunderstanding...she cannot go out with me?  although i had told myself in my mind that i will not be affected by her, the fact is that i can't control the disappointment and bad feelings after the rejection of the date. the feeling that i had a yr plus ago was back....that same feeling of admiration, despair, doubt. i feel like going all out to woo her...but i can't accept the failure. i noe that a failure here will lead to loss of concentration to do any other things....school work in particular.  she is just unique....no one ever comes close. is she really the one in my life? i must admit that i do not fully understand her...but i oso do not fully understand why i like her....it's hard to describe...it's the whole package. i wonder if i will ever meet someone like her again.

      now having doubts if i can execute the plan properly....there's the problem of getting flowers at a place near her house. i wouldn't want to carry flowers while taking the mrt....then there is the problem of whether giving her a cd of mp3s would be too lame....she might think of it as cheapo. anyway i just want to give her something different...something that she can use and able to enjoy....  actually shld give chocolate...instead of roses....coz that may be too strong....'intention' wise. chocolates should be quite neutral rite....at least won't be embarassed if i have been getting wrong signals....

      suddenly have this impulse of sending her a stalk of rose and a cd of mp3s.....consisting of love songs. i wonder if it will be a pleasant surprise.....or a rude surprise......  in any case....i really wish that she would be happy this vday. at least she gets appreciated on that day...thinking of going to her house early in the morning to give her everything. but that would mean i have to wake up sibe early....  i'm oso scared that i have getting the wrong signals all the while......till now i still think that alot of guys interested in her.....esp in oak3.....

      the fact that she sms me during the badminton last time....the fact that she sat next to me during the dinner.....the fact that she tried to strike a conversation with me....are these hints that she has a liking, perhaps small, towards me??..  i am struggling with the decision to ask her out on vday....that's one. the 2nd is thru what.....sms or thru phone. icq would be very lame.....but it will seem out of the blue leh. from no dates to a date on vday itself....that's a rather big jump. that's what i want to avoid...jumping the gun.   suddenly had this idea of creating a mini-cd that has love songs in mp3 as a gift for her. main motive is to make her feel appreciated this vday...coz she may be feeling quite low. but dunno how to pass to her...wait for her at her hse? that may be too aggressive. oso she may feel strange....that is if she dunno i still like her....  haiz only 4 days left....somemore got fyp to do.....

      i icq msg her to tell her abt the forum thingie....oso asking her if she's fine. next day eagerly went to check if she replied. nope...although she's oredi online liao. haiz a bit disheartened....seems that she's ignoring me. so went online and started a small chat. learnt abt her r/s.....small jokes here and there and oso some serious talking. i feel that i still like her.....but she mentioned she's scared of r/s now....backing out from potential ones. think that's what she said.  haiz.....really just want to go up to her and hug her...that kind of feeling. i wonder if she's even the slightest attracted to me. think she has quite a number of suitors...i dunno where i rank among them but my r/s with her is definitely not very close. there r some guys who are much closer to her. at least that's the impression i get lar.  today went to my aunt's place for dinner....as usual every yr....and yeah.....i was forced to eat a portion that is beyond filling. that's fine for me in the past but now i dun really like to get too full....full is just enough. so a bit dulanz....they still treating me as if i'm an adolscent.....'eat more, young man shld be able to eat more'.....  this yr really no mood.....dun even bother to talk to my so-called stepsis......just wanna go home and watch epl matches.

      it's such a coincidence....the question over sj's status was still at the back of my mind. then as i was surfing the funkygrad forum....happen to read a thread which was exactly what i guessed had happened. and curiosity got the better of me....and i went to check the icq number....and it turns out that it was really her who wrote the msg. how taiko can that be!!...seems to me that the chance is extremely small.....  dunno why but my heart was pounding when i sat next to her during dinner on sat....i can still feel that liking towards her....just that it was not as strong as the beginning when i just noe her lar. but then again i was oredi rejected once.....if that one can be termed a 'proper' proposal....heard somewhere that if kenna rejected, can basically forget abt it liao....  i just wished i hadn't done what i have done that time....think i got out of control then.

      the first day of cny was just as expected.....same places, same ppl.....it's been a year but then it seems like i met them not long ago. think i cannot feel the cny mood....long extinct in me. even getting hongbaos feels like a routine...just a custom, tradition. the meaning is long gone....anyway i'm more interested in meeting my maternal aunties and uncles. at least can see my small cousins....i'm guilty of not knowing some of my cousins' names. especially those who are borne recently.  2nd day was more boring.....woke up at 11am.....slept at 4pm....woke up at 7pm.....haiz raining mah so feeling a bit cozy on the bed. played pool with ed and jw they all.....first time that i saw some of their gfs....haiz seems like only wl and i unattached there. then had supper at a prata shop opp beauty world...finally knew where that is. prata so so only......but came to know of many prata.....what tissue p, paper p, planta p......those indians very creative. even the beverages' names are interesting.....milo dinosaur....milo godzilla.....wakau......

      battlefield 1942 is very addictive....think i played it for most of the time this week....other than doing some runs for my fyp. there are many levels to it....so many vehicles to learn and different types of soldiers as well. starting to use the medic...which i think is quite good since i can heal myself. and the ak-like submachine gun is not bad too.  cny reunion dinner was special this year for a couple of reasons. first...it's the first time that it's held in my house...usually it's at my uncle's house, which is rather old liao at redhill. secondly...we had steamboat...also a first coz usually it's meat, soup and the same old usual stuff that one of my relative cook every year....and i mean EVERY year....it's the same. so it's different this year. lastly, it's the first time since 10 yrs that i had reunion dinner with 'mum'....now it's not my actual mum but then the feeling of a family is more complete than yrs before.  actually it's kind of boring....coz the routine for each year is almost the same, if not THE same....even the order with which we visit my father's brother and sister is the same. this year is not going to be different either....just that there's going to be a jc class gathering....hmm wonder how have the others changed...esp the girls coz just met some of the guys recently. that's something different this year.

      well today's presentation was quite ok....at least i felt so. although he asked alot of questions...most of them are answerable....just some clarifications here and there. actually i forgot one crucial thing....to smile! i think i must have appeared too serious....makes the atmosphere a bit tense i guess. anyway there was the usual 'good!' exclamation at the end....i think it's an encouraging sign.....  hopefully will have the will to continue doing somemore things......ya need to download the papers that was emailed to me....  one whole xiong week is finally over.....phew........now left ca4 and the final exam......then it's the end of one phase of my life. i'm not sure i'm prepared to enter to the next but.....just have to take things as they come i guess.  my hair's thinning and i'm still feeling lousy abt this.....thinking of getting medicine but tot of the continuous cost every month associated with it. is my hair worth 200 maybe 300 dollars per mth? or rather is my self-esteem worth that much?.....think it's a decision that is postponed time after time....

      i passed my driving test!!!.....it came as a shock when the examiner told me that i passed. actually as i was driving back...towards the end of the route, i noticed him dozing off...i tot i had an immediate failure somewhere during the beginning. Actually i nearly mount the kerb during the perpendicular parking.....i just went forward and did it my own way....tot that would amount to immediate failure. also at the very beginning....i fumbled at the emergency brake. stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake!!! but other than this 2 incident....everything was rather smooth....yah one more thing is that i crossed the junctino during amber light. but i cannot stop in time.  think it's my lucky day....hopefully the ca3 presentation tmr goes smoothly as well.....this week very stressed...

       As I begin my working life, I am starting to ponder about the real meaning of working. What is the main objective of working?   First of all, is it just a means to earning money? Should I try to get a job that is unbearable but gives me more money? I think I will hestitate to place money as the top criteria. Since I spend more time working than spending the money that I earn, the job should be at least satisfying. To me, people that work hard will spend hard. But is there a need to be this extreme? Why not work reasonably hard and not spend too much? And in the process, have some time out to engage in other more personal and fulfilling interests. Then again, why not make your job THE personal and fulfilling interest? That would be ideal, but I guess not many people can achieve that. The main reason is practicality (money earned may be less), and also figuring out what is really worth the time and effort.  Then comes the next question, is work more important than my personal life and leisure? Do I really want to forgo time that can spent enjoying life or having the company of friends, in my office? The company is not going to take care of you when you are sick, when you are retrenched. So why put in so much effort and time on something that doesn't really care? I wonder why so many people put so much effort in their work when they should be watching their children grow up, spending time with their spouses and old friends. Is it because they are just trying hard to make a living, and the jobs nowadays demand more of people? Or are they just really so interested in what they are doing?  I always feel that even the most interesting thing will get boring when you do it day in day out for many years. Does it mean that I will change job every few years? And lose the security that comes with job? Or will I adapt so well and become reluctant to switch job scope?

       I had my lunch today, all alone. Seems like it's going to be like that in the days to come. Actually, it wouldn't be that bad if the canteen is not that crowded. Today, the canteen was packed when I went, and everyone was yakking away. Felt really alone...perhaps it's because usually will meet up with wave people during lunch.   I think it's the pressure from my boss that's making me feel uptight. He's always iterating to me that I must learn fast. Well, can't he just leave me some space to breathe! I know what he expects already, so leave me alone. He asked for a weekly report...what the hell am I supposed to write! Anyway, I hope I can learn the basic by this week.

       I am thinking about the motivation to work, and it seems that the motivation has to come from somewhere that is outside of that person. I mean, he can be working to provide a good life for his family, gain recognition from his friends, earn money to satisfy material needs. Does anyone really work for the job itself, because the job is interesting and challenging? Or does anyone work to prove to himself that he is capable?  I don't think people really enjoy their work, or at least the majority of the people. But perhaps, they have grown used to doing it that somehow, they stick with it. In the end, it's the pay they get that's more important than the job itself.  For a guy with a girlfriend, I would think that in the initial years of his career, the motivation of working is to earn money so that enough can be saved for marriage. Marriage is not cheap here. Then after that, it would be working to earn money for raising children, which is also quite expensive. So for such a guy, the motivation to work is there.  However, for a guy without a girlfriend, the motivation is less clear. Will he be motivated to climb up the ladder so that girls would start to notice him more? By the time he reach there, he'll be over 30 I believe, and that age I think is a bit over the suitable marriage age. And if he spends all his effort on his work, he'll not have time to scout for a partner.
