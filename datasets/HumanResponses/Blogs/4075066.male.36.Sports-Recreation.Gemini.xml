      So! This is my on-line journal. There isn't too much to it at the moment, but it will fill up with details of my adventures over the next few months, and hopefully it will provide an entertaining read. Let me know if it is (or isn't) as it will be nce to hear from you.  Later  David

      The world of preparation can be a painful one. Actually, it isn't THAT painful. I have just had two jabs to protect me from the evils of Hep A and Tetanus whilst I am on my travels and I now feel assured that no horrible little bug is going to see fit to kill me off.  After I had had my jabs I went to Starbucks for a cuppa and a bit of a sit down. I noticed that they are promoting a new range of teas which looked quite interesting and so, being adventurous, I opted for the 'Anchovy Tea.' (A light, refreshing brew with a hint of the Med!) My tea was delivered to me, as was my blueberry muffin, and I took a tentative sip. 'That is not anchovy tea!' I exclaimed to the young lady who served me. 'That is Pilchard tea.' She looked at the tea bag and insisted that it was anchovy, to which I replied, 'No, that is a completely different kettle of fish!'  Well I think it is funny!  Planning a trip is really an excuse to go shopping for all sorts of toys. I have just been surfing around looking for the ultimate travel pack. As I plan to go trekking, sailing, diving, running, surfing and god knows what else, I will need to take quite a selection of clothing and gear with me and so I will need to purchase some wonder of modern technology to pack everything into. There are gazillions of web sites out there, each of which have wonderful pictures of wonderful packs, each of which seems to fulfil the criteria that I have set, ie large, robust and has lots of pockets, pouches and compartments. I think that the web falls down at this point because if you are like me, and I am sure that you are, you want to get in there and have a good root around in the bag inorder to ensure that it is large. That it is robust. And most importantly that it does have lots of pockets, pouches and compartments. Not to mention a handy little hook to hang your keys on.  The web has allowed me to review a number of packs that I feel will be suitable for my purposes and so now I must go on a mini expedition to several camping shops to track down the fabulous products that I have been led to believe exist in the real world. Hopefully this journey will result in me finding something that I can bond with and that will allow me to pack far too much stuff into. It wouldn't be right if there wern't several items that I transported around the globe that didn't see the light of day from Nottingham to Nottingham.  Book of the day - Join Me, by Danny Wallace. Most entertaining.

      Well, I have booked it anyway. My ticketed route is from Heathrow to Delhi, Singapore, Adelaide, Aukland, Papeet, LA and then back to jolly old London. My travel itinery will incorporate trips up to Nepal for a spot of hiking; to Southern India to meet Sal, Jim, Jayne, Shaun and Anj for some chilling; to Sydney for New Year with Ian, Sharon and Matt; and also a couple of trips to somewhere in South America for some more hiking/trekking, SCUBA diving and surfing. It should be fun.  I have no plans to do any extreme tidying, Helmut! I will be maintaining a level of personal hygene and order about my belongings, but I figure that the rest of the world can look after itself for a couple of months.  Got to go and get my jabs sorted out now, so take care and I will post another update if anything else happens.
