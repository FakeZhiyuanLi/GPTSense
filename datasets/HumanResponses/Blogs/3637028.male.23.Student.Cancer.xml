      About 6 months ago I was standing inside the Hi-Pointe theater and saw this strange movie poster for a film titled "Bubba Ho-Tep".  I knew I'd have no chance of seeing it in St. Louis because we only get the big budget pieces of crap that Hollywood shoves down your throat for your "enjoyment."  We get the occasional art-house or indie film picture, but not the amount that we should have. Anyway, I forgot about this poster until I was browsing through Blockbuster recently looking for anything that would be interesting and I happened to see the reduced version of the poster I had seen many months ago.  I'm sure you're asking yourself right now, "What the hell is this all about?"  Here's a quick synopsis of the film:   Elvis is alive and living in a retirement home in Texas.  Another of the residents is a black man who believes he is JFK.  The two have to team up to stop a mummy from ancient Egypt from sucking the souls out of their fellow residents.   That was enough for me to want to find out what this was all about, and then I discovered that Bruce Campbell (star of the "Evil Dead" series) played Elvis.  I realized that I HAD to see this film.  I'm not going to tell you any more about the movie.  I'd be spoiling it for you.

      So I was looking at some websites, clicking on links that were there, and I clicked this blogger link.  After looking around at it I decided to use this to my advantage and make my own damn webpage.  And here it is! I didn't want to go too flashy, because it's not me and I don't know how.  Posts won't be much more than a thought I may have had that day or news about me.  Hence the name of the page: Krap.   For today there isn't much.  I'm wasting time because I'm supposed to be writing a short essay for my English class this summer and cleaning my room so a realtor can start showing my house to potential parties.  What no one knows yet though is that I'm part of the deal:  You buy the house, you get a tenant that lives in your basement, pays no rent, and eats your food.

      During one of my late nights of boredom I was sitting on my couch watching MTV and this weird looking band came on.  Weird as in an AV-room-kind-of-way from high school.  I check out the little description in the corner and their name is Coheed & Cambria.  If anybody knows what this means I'd like to know.  The song was called "A Favor House Atlantic," again explanation would be appreciated.  They start playing and it's just another Emo band.  Then the singer, a slightly overweight Iranian-looking guy with long stringy hair, opens his mouth.  At this point I laid my head back and stared at the ceiling pondering what made the bobble-head doll craze what it became when the voice I heard sounded was Geddy Lee's.  This voice is not easily copied so I quickly looked back at the screen to see if MTV came to their senses and started playing a Rush video instead.  Nope, same band and same weird looking singer.  Being the curious little monkey that I am I looked them up and found that not only does the lead singer sound like Lee but they have a song entitled "2113".  Obviously the similarity in the voices wasn't missed on the band.  I've listened to a few of their songs, it's not bad but not exactly Rush.  Check 'em out if you wish (click post title).  I was just bored and thought this would be a good post topic.

      I was checking out this  urlLink website I like to look at every once in awhile pertaining to video games and a comic strip  when I found this  urlLink link .  It's a music video for some techno that is based on the old theme song from Trans Formers.  It stars Soundwave, the giant Decepticon boombox, and a tape that shoots out of his chest.  If you don't remember him you will once you start watching it and remember the old show.  It takes a long ass time to load so be patient and make yourself a sandwich to eat while watching it.

      Tonight I set upon the task of transferring a bunch of files from my old computer to the new.  I had no idea how many files I had that I didn't want to get rid of yet.  Most of them stupid pictures that I'll eventually get rid of.  I had a lot of writing to copy over too.  Not having a CD burner on that old computer made it a bitch to copy all of that stuff too.  Many trips back and forth with little diskettes.  Anyway, I came across this short I had written a while back.  I wish I could remember when I did it because when I read it tonight I was surprised I had written anything this good.  Not that I'm patting myself on the back or anything, I just really like the thing.  It touches a cord, as some say.  I'm sure some of you have seen this but I'm going to post it anyway:  	The yellows and oranges, splashes of red and greens, that’s what I see at my feet.  Colors so often seen in nature at this time.  The leaves cover the sidewalk and the bench space next to me.  Creating a sunset for the ground, one to walk on and to know what it is to be a part of something beautiful.  The hills ahead of me, the rolling hills.  With the sunset in front of me, the hills seem to look like waves from the sun, just increasing the awe of the world surrounding me, enveloping me in it’s warmth.   	It’s not that warm though.  I still have to wear a sweater to protect me from the gentle winds.  Winds that blow the paints from the trees to fall at my feet.  The winds that create the whistling and rustling of the leaves that haunted me in my youth at night.  Now I rely on the sounds to remind me that I’m still alive and not on another plane of existence.  Sometimes I forget the wonders that this world can create within its’ self.  I often believe I’m dreaming that this could never be real.  Only in a dream would one ever think that something so wondrous could exist. 	The simplest things bring me back to realize where I am.  The honking of a car horn, ringing of a telephone, or the sound of so many noises not needed in this place.  This time there are children running in the leaves, stirring them into the air.  The sunlight just seems to make the colors glow, more radiant, more amazing than one could ever hope to see.  A handsome black dog runs up to join the children, trying to catch the leaves in the air.  Making the children begin to giggle and laugh.  These are some of the sounds meant to be heard by human ears, just to remember what innocence really is, and just how to love something just to love it.  Their laughter grows as the dog is desperately trying to catch a single leaf before it hits the earth.  The children start gathering piles of leaves together and throwing them at one another.  The dog’s frenzy increases and the sight of the poor dog just causes the children to laugh even harder.  Soon the children are on the ground laughing and wrestling with the pooch.   	I take some time to look into the trees.  Most look more like a skeleton of their prior selves.  Even the birds that would be hopping along a limb to tend their nests are gone.  The only things I can see are a few sparse pieces of that gold paper that are so magical, and a random squirrel.  So gracefully the squirrel jumps from branch to branch, from tree to tree.  Taking what would be a sure death for any other animal, but a jump that comes second nature to them.  They almost look like they’re trying to fly, with their outstretched arms trying to hold on to as much air as possible like a man jumping out of a plane before he opens his chute.  All the while the squirrels are carrying acorns collected from the ground to hide in their homes for the long cold months ahead. 	I return my glance to the children and there they are, still at their little game, rolling on the ground, for what seems like hours.  I’m just sitting here on my bench, following the sun sinking into the horizon, watching the children play all at the same time.  After some time the children’s laughter slows and resembles now more a gasp for air, to recover from the excitement.  The boy and girl sink into the ground and become shadows among the leaves.  One sits up and starts to look around.  It must be the girl; her long hair is caught in the gentle winds.  She waves to me and I return the gesture.  She is nothing more than a silhouette behind the setting gold, red, and orange hues behind her adding to the magic of the moment.  Then she leans over and pokes her friend.  He rises to his elbows and looks in my direction, I wave at him.  He sits up and waves right back in a spastic back and forth of his hand.  The dog’s head pops up from beneath leaves that the children had covered it with.  I can hear it’s panting, faintly but rhythmically.  It looks around to see what made the children rise from the colored earth. 	Off in the distance there’s a voice.  One unfamiliar to me, but the children react to it immediately.  They quickly hurry off and leave me once again with the seemingly never ending sun and its’ rolling glow.  As I sit there the sun slowly sinks deeper and deeper until all that is left is the sunburned leaves and the cool soothing breezes.  It continues to get darker and soon nothing can be seen in the vast emptiness of the night.  A haunted feeling comes over me; the lack of light is not a comfortable one.  But, the breeze is still here, and so am I.  And like the sun returns, I will too to see it return to its beauty in the sky, the beauty that can never be reproduced by camera or brush, only in my mind.

      You may notice that the site's look changes from time to time.  I'm still trying to figure out which style best says, "This isn't as important as it looks."

      I've been looking over this thing for hours trying to figure out how to do some fancy schmancy crap to this website and all I've figured out is how to post a picture, but I wanted to add it to my profile so it would always show and I don't know how to do  that .  Unfortunately I've got no pictures worth posting...  I might put one on here now that I think of it, but it's just 'cause it's so damn funny.  I still can't figure out how to link other websites to this one, or else I would have put some awesome friggin' links on here by now. Like  urlLink this one here , or  urlLink this tough guy's site .  But I don't know how to do that other than in a damn post. I'm wasting my time here, as usual, though because I really should be applying to colleges in Houston.  I know one of them is due at the end of the week.  And I've got another essay to write for my English class.  And let's not forget that I've got to rewrite the first one I did 10 minutes before it was due.  Everyone in class has to do it though so I'm not going to put the teacher on my list...  yet .   I've got to go drive my dad to the airport now so I'm done.

      Thursday morning my house was available for public viewing.  It was the longest day ever.  I had to be out of the house by 9am and then I was able to come home for two one hour intervals for the rest of the day until after my evening class ended at around 8pm.  When I arrived home my mom was on the phone and it turns out we had three decent offers, all above the asking price.  From what I've heard my dad botched the negotiations and just went to the highest bidder and tried to squeeze some more money from them instead of going back to the lower bidders and seeing if they'd raise and then continue the bidding war.  Luckily the highest bidder didn't just walk away from that crap and the contract, I think, has been signed.  Now the next thing is to find a place in Houston and get out of here by the closing date of August 16.  I still haven't gotten word on where I'm going to school in the fall.  Right now I'm just hoping that I can get accepted somewhere.

      So I saw Spider-Man 2 over the weekend and I have to say I liked it.  I've heard some people complaining about it and I think they were just expecting more after hearing how it was better than the first.  Never listen to critcs, they don't know what they're talking about.  Here's a few of my gripes about it though:   *I thought Doc Ock was a great villian, but they didn't use him nearly enough in the story.   *I didn't quite get why Spider-Man had to have his mask off so much and now everyone knows who he is. *And Kirsten Dunst doesn't do it for me.  She just isn't MJ to me.   Before seeing the film I heard that there were clues as to what the next villian would be.  I thought it was going to be Venom, but if the end of the film was the "clue" I heard of then I was wrong and it wasn't much of a clue and just a slap in the face with a cold fish.   Now I'm really looking forward to  urlLink X-Men 3 , whenever that is coming out.

      I've heard from two reliable sources that a  urlLink friend of mine of swedish decent  has gotten engaged.  I don't know if the rumors are true since the person in question has not told me directly, but the sources are good.  So congratulations from everybody here at "The Krap" if indeed this information is correct, and if not congratulations on staying single. (Special thanks to B. Overkamp for the photo.)

      The power in my house has just been returned!  After close to 40 hours of no electricity and sour milk the AC kicked to life.  If you remember  urlLink Jason Lee's  line in " urlLink Dogma " about air conditioning... you saw that movie.  As a guy that likes to do things after the sun goes down I was stuck twiddling my thumbs because nothing was lit, nothing was open, and I wasn't tired.  I did go out to Steak & Shake last night for a little nosh and watched a girl puke up the gum she swallowed back in 1990 when she was three.  For some reason she was in the guys bathroom.  Watching that taught me an important lesson:  too much drinking leads to lots of puking which leads to no friends.  If only I had known that earlier...  At least I can pass it on to the youth of the world so they don't commit the same mistake as I did.  Now I'm going to take a shower with a goddam light on!

       urlLink    So this is what I bought today with some cash I happened to get.  I was also able to get  urlLink this .  That was probably the highlight of the day.   It started off with my idiot brother waking me up at 8am so he could watch a guy ride a bike for a couple of hours.  A GUY RIDING A FUCKING BIKE!  It's like watching somebody doing jazzersize.  What's the point?  Then I tried to go out to eat with my mom and sister, but right after we ordered our food she started whining about not feeling well and we had to go.  Then I had to go to class.  After that I waited around for a friend to call me back after her class so we could go get a drink at a bar only to have her call me and tell me she can't because of homework.   This day is like a model for my whole life.  I think I'm doing one thing but because of circumstances I'm forced to do something else.  Here's to another year.&nbsp; urlLink

      Took a trip to Columbia for a day with Overkamp.  Tried to spend as much time as I could with everyone I knew there, but too many things got in the way.  None of these things were the individuals fault, the blame lies on me for making this spur of the moment trip.  Weirdest thing was talking to Phatty J who I hadn't talked to in years and SEEING Chris-terious in the mall, where he still works after all these years.  I'd like to thank Abbey for putting herself on the line to make it possible.  Thanks Abbey.  (Probably doesn't even know about this site)  That chair I slept on was damn comfy.  Wish I could have spent a lot more time with everybody.   When I got home I went over to my uncle's and had a damn good meal.  We tried watching "Lawrence of Arabia" but was unaware of the length of it and only got to intermission, so don't tell me about the rest.   For a look at the trip click  urlLink here .

      After a week in Houston my parents finally settled on a  urlLink house .&nbsp; The decision was down to two, but this one had five bedrooms and a pool, which they had promised to my siblings.&nbsp; The closing date is August 24, the house I'm in now closes August 16.&nbsp; I'm not sure how this is going to work but it looks like we're going to have to live in my dad's two room apartment for a week or go on vacation or something.&nbsp; I have yet to hear about being accepted into any schools down there yet so I'm not sure what I'll be doing once I'm down there.&nbsp; Might just have to get a real job and join the monotony of the corporate world.&nbsp;

      I watched  urlLink "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"  tonight, thanks to a friend who works at Blockbuster who got it for free.&nbsp; That had to be the worst movie ever made, but funny as all hell.&nbsp; It's crappy-factor was on par with  urlLink "Cannibal!&nbsp; The Musical" .&nbsp; I didn't get a chance to watch it with the commentary, so Cannibal is still close to the top of my list of best DVD commentaries.&nbsp; I did try and watch all of the special features and there is a great featurette with the cast talking about making it along with how they each approached playing the "bad actor" parts.&nbsp; After that the movie seemed funnier just because I had a better appreciation for how hard they had to work at being so bad.&nbsp;  I'm seriously thinking about writing a movie like this and producing it.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I'd go sci-fi or not though.&nbsp; I'm leaning more towards a gangster film.&nbsp; I wouldn't want to look like I'm trying to rip-off Cadavra, but the 50's sci-fi genre is so easily made into a ridiculously, funny movie.&nbsp; With my limited movie experience it would be a piece of cake to make it look like crap too.&nbsp; I guess stating that I want to make a film like Cadavra would mean doing&nbsp;a sci-fi film would be an homage to it...&nbsp; Or I would just be a hack stealing other people's good ideas like  urlLink Jay Leno .

      Tonight my dad took me out gambling for the first time as a birthday thing.&nbsp; I have to say that the whole thing was a unique experience, but overall I don't think I'll be making a habit of it.&nbsp; My brother sat at a slot machine for a while pumping coins in but not getting any results.&nbsp; For some reason my dad kept giving him money.&nbsp; I think he just thought it funny that his sons are now old enough to drink and gamble legally and wanted to take it all in.&nbsp; Or he just wanted to lose some money.&nbsp; After walking around for awhile to see what the rest of the casino was like I took a seat at a blackjack table to try my luck.&nbsp; The lowest minimum table I could find was $5 and it didn't take long to lose it all.&nbsp; I won, I think, three hands and that was it.&nbsp; I kept getting dealt 12 and 13, hit and bust or get 16 or 17, and the dealer kept getting 20.&nbsp; I didn't' have a chance.  The thing that I'll remember most about the night though is the pathetic people that looked like they were there every night, or at least on the weekends.&nbsp; Sure I don't know what it feels like to win big but to go through all the cash that they must have lost over the years could have lasted me years without even having to work.&nbsp; Maybe I'll go back tomorrow night with a bucket and try to catch people before they go in and tell them they'd be better off giving their money to me and just have that warm feeling from knowing they've given to a worthy cause instead of the emptiness of loss.

       urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink     So today we had a garage sale to sell some of the crap that we've accumulated over the years and one of the sale patrons ripped the bumper off my beautiful car.&nbsp; Somehow the little plastic piece on the side of my door came off and my right-side headlight cracked too.&nbsp; I don't know when it's going to be fixed but at the moment I don't know how to take it off or attach it to the car.&nbsp; There's&nbsp;a bunch of plastic things that popped off and I guess I could try to attach it like that, but the claims guy from my insurance company hasn't seen it yet and I don't really have anywhere to go in the immediate future.  Oh, and I was accepted to UMSL, but that doesn't help because I won't be in St. Louis attend.

      So Friday I was doing my daily morning routine, eating cereal and reading the comics in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, when I realized that it was the day for  urlLink Garden State  to debut in more cities.  I've been waiting for this to come out in St. Louis for many months now so my fingers were moving quickly to turn the page to the movie listings and take a look at the playing times for G.S. at the local theaters.  That's odd... there's no listing for Garden State.  I turn my attention to the "art house" theaters... nadda.  I look at the cereal in my bowl becoming soggier with each passing second as I try and figure out why I'm not seeing Garden State listed in any of these theaters play lists. Since I had just woken up I rubbed my eyes a few times to make sure I wasn't seeing things and just overlooking it as I have begun to do in my old age of 23.  Old age is a bitch.  Anyway, I searched through every theater and came up with the same result.  NO Garden State.  I looked at all of the ads for the various movies that try to suck the movie-goers pockets dry to leave them with nothing left but lint when a movie of merit somehow slips by the distributors greedy eyes.  There was no mention of Garden State to be found.  St. Louisans should feel privileged however, because there are two theaters playing  urlLink Metallica's documentary  about themselves and I'm sure that would be much more entertaining than the hilarious looking (since I have no way of knowing whether it is funny or not) film by  urlLink Zach Braff  of "Scrubs" fame entitled Garden State. This is not the first time the St. Louis movie scene has let me down.  There has been too many times that a film has been released that has gotten favorable reviews from nearly every critic on the planet but I have to wait to see it once it comes to Blockbuster or Hollywood Video because there isn't a theater within 200 miles that will show it (the rental stores and the distributors must be in cahoots or one in the same entity).  We can get documentaries about played out metal bands and circuses, but when a real film should be playing on the big screen we somehow miss out on it. I've been fuming about this for two days now and I'm tired at the moment so my attempt at writing a bitchy post might just come off sounding like a ranting stream of conscience.  If I knew who to complain to I'd write a letter to each person at fault every day for as long as it would take to have the film selection in St. Louis improve, but screw it I'm moving to Houston in a week and I'm sure it's playing there.  I'd much rather not have to wait a week to be able to see it but it looks like I have no choice.

      As of 5:30pm on August 2, 2004 I have completed enough credits to obtain an Associate Arts degree from  urlLink St. Louis Community College  (a.k.a. Meramec).  It only took me 5 years and 1 summer term to finish this 2 year program, but I did it.  I haven't gotten that little piece of paper yet declaring my accomplishment, I'm not even sure if they give those out for A.A degrees, and I've got to try and get it before I leave for Houston or at least have it sent to the new address.  The only problem with getting this done is that now I have to declare a major at  urlLink UHD  and I don't have a clue what that is going to be.

      Since my class has ended, more like since I finished writing all the essays I was missing and turned them in, I've been spending some time going over some movie trailers trying to figure out what movies to look forward to and which ones to make fun of. There are a lot of films out there just asking to be ridiculed. Instead of wasting time on those I thought I'd share some that I am looking forward to seeing or ones that I just thought looked funny:   urlLink Team America: World Police  -- It's funny that a film like this is coming out after the  urlLink Thunderbirds  gets remade and replaced with a live cast. How did anybody ever greenlight  urlLink Bill Paxton  in a movie after... you could really put just about anything of his here, and why is  urlLink Ben Kingsley  making films like this? This actually has nothing to do with Team America, but these questions need answers.   urlLink SpongeBob Squarepants: The Movie  -- Being a fan of the show of course I'm going to look forward to seeing an hour and a half of spongy goodness. And the  urlLink teaser  is one of the most imaginative things I've seen in my 23 years.   urlLink Alien vs. Predator  -- I've been looking forward to this one for awhile, 'cause I'm a comic book nerd and a sci-fi dork. After a bunch of video games and comics telling stories about it we finally get to see some action on the big screen.   urlLink Napoleon Dynamite  -- I don't often like stupid comedies, can't beat  urlLink The Jerk , but this one looks pretty good. I don't have a clue why this one is so different to me, maybe it's because it was made by Mormons. They're a weird people.   urlLink The Incredibles  -- Pixar can do no wrong in my book. I have yet to dislike a film they've made and  urlLink Sam "Bad Mother Fucker" Jackson  is in this one.   urlLink Garden State  -- I've been waiting for this one for months. This  urlLink guy  told me about it and after seeing the trailer I was hooked like a heroin addict on  urlLink Coke . I also recently discovered  urlLink Zach Braff's blog  about what he's been doing recently to promote the film and his thanks for everyone's support.  I didn't know this blog stuff was so trendy.   urlLink Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events  -- Again, don't know why I like this one. I saw the trailer and just thought  urlLink Jim Carrey  was funny as hell and he plays a number of parts. After a couple of flops my faith in him returned when I saw  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and  urlLink Bruce Almighty . And after taking a quick look at  urlLink IMDB  for some stuff on him it looks like he's going to be playing Walter Mitty in a  urlLink film  just announced.   urlLink Finding Neverland  --  urlLink Johnny Depp , (with the exception of  urlLink Secret Window ) 'nuff said. Looks like he's got some  urlLink good   urlLink stuff  coming up too.   urlLink Collateral  -- I haven't seen to many movies where people get shot lately. That's really the only reason. I'm not a big fan of  urlLink Tom Cruise , I think he's  urlLink overrated .   urlLink Batman Begins  -- For the love of Joe, it's fucking Batman! And this one doesn't look like it'll  urlLink blow . The only beef I've got is the weird title.  There may be a few other trailers that I've seen that have sparked an interest in me, but nothing really worth mentioning. This is a pretty good list for now. If there's anything you find let me know and I'll check it out and possibly make fun of you for recommending such a stupid movie.  This is a record for me as "longest post yet." High five!

      First day of August today. Yep. This is usually one of the worst months of the year, it's the hottest and for those that go to school (like me) they have to get ready to go back. I've got the added bonus (HA!) of moving about 900 miles about two weeks from now to Houston which is even hotter (I'm so glad it's August) than St. Louis. I did get accepted to  urlLink University of Houston - Downtown  though, so I don't have to worry any more about what I'm going to do this fall. I'm planning on going to Houston for a few days either later this week or early next week so I can register for classes. I don't start until August 23rd (almost September by then) so I've got a week of living in my dad's three room apartment or trying to figure out some place else to chill out of town for a few days so I don't go crazy having to be so close to my family. Anybody want to house and feed me for a couple of days with no chance of receiving money for your services?  urlLink Still haven't gotten that fucking bumper fixed... DAMMIT!  I found out my right blinker is falling off too and the claims guy said that it was a separate incident. Luckily none of this happened in August, or August would have some 'splaining to do.

       urlLink    urlLink    Since my car went into the shop Monday I had to get a car so I could make it to various appointments and do other meaningless crap the rest of the week. Just for the hell of it I asked for a rental car after the insurance company of the woman who hit me offered it. I've never gotten a rental car before, and it's a good excuse to drive someone else's car that you would normally never drive. Expecting to get a car similar to my own Altima imagine my shock when a Jaguar X 3.0 (I don't know the year and I don't even know what the "X 3.0" means, I'm not much of a car guy). I had actually gone to Enterprise to see if I could get the car before I had to turn in my Altime on Sunday, but they were closed. While I was there with my brother I happened to see a similar Jaguar sitting in a spot and I jokingly said to Keegan that I wanted that one. I think the only difference between the two is the color. As the papers were being signed the Enterprise employee was practically begging me to take the $15 dollar a day insurance coverage in case of an accident, but I passed 'cause I'm a badass driver and the only time my car gets dinged is when it's parked and some other jackass decides to hit it.I'm probably going to have to return it Friday, when the trusty Kosmobile is supposed to be returned to me, but I'm going to enjoy it while I can. I've been getting some funny looks from people as I cruise by. I bet they think I'm somebody important. Those fools.
