      Below is a genuine email send out to staff at an unnamed company.   ------   To: All Staff  Subject: Copier   Please, please please please please - I am begging - keep any and all paper clips away from the copier!   We have had two service calls in the last few days removing paper clips, staples and a binder clip from the innards of the copier.   PLEASE be really really really really careful around the copier. Especially the document handler, which seems to suck clits like a vacuum cleaner.    Thanks for your help.

      有一天鄭小惠由高雄搭野雞車北上...   一上車因為有點睡意,就向身旁的先生說:"麻煩到台中時叫醒我"   那位先生也很爽快地答應了   沒想到那位先生只搭到彰化,所以臨下車前請司機要記得叫醒小惠...   司機滿口答應...沒想到車開到林口才想到要叫小惠   司機心想反正等會還要原車南下,就等到台中時再叫她...  於是車在台北調頭原車南下了...   到台中後司機立刻去叫醒小惠:"小姐台中到了"   小惠面帶笑容地道謝,卻彎腰從行李中拿東西,沒有下車的意思...   司機滿臉疑惑的問:"小姐你不是要到台中?"   手中拿著便當的小惠說:   "我是要到台北,可是我媽媽說要到台中才能吃便當,  所以我才請人到台中叫醒我"。

      某國的國防部緊急招兵，一位鄉下的農民也被徵召，軍中給了他們三天的訓練。  第一天教刺槍術，在發刺槍時，發到農夫前一位就發完了，班長就拿了一隻棍子給他， 告訴他：  「當敵人來的時候拿著刺刀說：『這是刺槍，這是刺槍，我刺！刺！刺！......』敵人就會死了。」   第二天教步槍，在發步槍時，發到農夫前一位就發完了，班長就拿了一隻掃把給他，告訴他：  「當敵人來時拿著步槍說：『這是步槍，這是步槍，我BON！ BON！BON！.....』敵人就會死了。」   沒想到第三天TC兩國就開戰了。農夫也只好勉強上戰場，突然，前面來了一個敵人。  農夫就拿出棍子說：「這是刺槍，這是刺槍......」可想而知，敵人當然沒事，  接著，農夫馬上拿出掃把說：「這是步槍，這是步槍，我BON！BON！BON！」敵人依然沒事，  而且慢慢逼近了。  農夫很緊張，想著自己可能要戰死沙場了，對不起家中的老小，正在難過的時候，敵人走到了他面前，並且把他撞倒在地上，然後朝著農夫身後直直的走去，嘴裡喃喃地唸著：   「這是坦克車，這是坦克車......」

      BBC: Good morning, Minister.  MINISTER: Good morning to you too...  BBC: Can you explain your government hospitals’ structure?  MINISTER : It’s simple... we have 16 polyclinics and 15 hospitals and they are separated between two companies...  BBC: So these are public companies?  MINISTER: No, they are private companies.  BBC: But who owns them?  MINISTER: The government wholly owns them.  BBC: So they are public companies...  MINISTER: NO... they are private companies... Singhealth PRrrivate Limited and NHG PRrrivate Limited...  BBC: But they are owned by the government... how can they be private?  MINISTER: Well they are actually owned by MOH holdings... which is private.  BBC: What is MOH Holdings and who owns it?  MINISTER: It stands for “Ministry of Health” Holdings and it’s owned by the Ministry of Health.  BBC: How can MOH Holdings be private when it’s owned by MOH?  BBC: It’s registered as private, you see... so it’s private... how can a company registered as private be public?  BBC: Now I don't understand.. how can something that is wholly owned by government be private? So is your defence force private? Is your police private?  MINISTER: Well, if they are registered as private, they are legally private.... when they are not, they are legally public.. MOH Holdings and all the government hospitals are legally registered private companies, so they are private. If the law says so, what can I say?  BBC: But they are wholly owned by the Government, financed by the Ministry of Finance using taxpayers' public money…  MINISTER: Yes...  BBC: So how can government hospitals be made private? Especially when they are wholly owned by Government and financed by the Ministry of Finance using taxpayers’ public money? You simply want to charge private sector prices in public sector hospitals.... So you legally define them as such, though in economic terms, they have no meaning...   MINISTER: That's not true... We give subsidies.  BBC: (interjecting) Your public sector hospitals have prices higher than private sector hospitals too…  MINISTER: That’s true only for some cases.  BBC: Why should that be true at all, if it’s a public sector hospital? Is it because your huge pay is incorporated into the healthcare costs?  MINISTER: I am a public servant. Those are private companies. I am not paid by them.   BBC: So who pays your salary?  MINISTER: Taxpayers.  BBC: …who also pay for the running of your government hospitals.  MINISTER: No, they run on the revenue that they generate...  BBC: But that revenue comes from subventions from government which is taxpayers’ money from MOF...  MINISTER: But they are private companies...  BBC: Wholly owned by the Government!  MINISTER: It’s a simple concept. Let me explain again… Relax, just close your eyes, cross your legs and recite after me: private, wholly owned by government... private, wholly owned by government... it’s called enlightenment through submission…  BBC: I must call it a day... thanks for joining BBC, an organization that is still wholly owned by the government and still public...

      Lim Peh ka li kong, hor, nowsaday, our chewrens are being taught sex education in schools, you know!  What kind of disgraceful society is this!  In my day, we never learn about this kind of thing in school!  We all learned about sex from the nice auntie who lives in the house with red lights at Desker Road.  Now that they teach chewrens in school about sex, what will happen to the nice auntie?  More and more our traditional practices are being eroded by society's decadence!  Surely the persons most qualified to teach this is the world's oldest profession!  But I hear that the Ministry of Education's sex education package is a holistic one. I think it is a very good idea to have holistic sex education.  Because when I young that time, hor, I also donno where all the holes are.  But now, thanks to the gah'men, our chewrens will know.  In fact, I think that sex education should be open to adults as well.  (And senior citizens should also get discount.)  I have seen the sex education package and I think it's perfect for old people like me.  Because it's called "The Growing Years", and my kukucheow has not grown for a si beh long time. I have to learn how to grow it back.  I even went to buy some of that, whatacall, Viagra thing.  My neighbourhood sinseh got some, specially made in China one, so it's a bit cheaper.  But even though it can make my kukucheow stand, it also gives me diarrhoea at the same time. So it's a bit inconvenient.  As one of the kways in Desker Road told me, "Wah lau, I hear of people being shit in bed, but you damn one kind one."  I also tried some Rhino horn, but I tell you, it doesn't work.  I take oreddy, I only want to have sex with other rhinos.  And the bastards at the Singapore Zoo all do'wan to let me in to kan their African White Rhino.  My sinseh also gave me some tiger penis to try. Even worse than the rhino horn.  Not only did nothing happen to my kukucheow, all these bloody cats at the void deck kept spreading their legs in front of me. Si beh embarrassing, you know!  They should really include all these useful information inside the sex education package instead of talking so much about condoms.  All this obsession about condoms.  What have real estate developments to do with sex, I ask you?  Lim Peh ka li kong, all these education people got no bloody idea what to teach the kids about sex.  I have oreddy told my MP about this, and suggested that he save the Ministry of Education millions of dollars in putting together these expensive sex education materials.  Just ask them to send the chewrens to my house and I will teach them.  My lessons will all be interactive one.  The girls can help demonstrate, while the boys can watch.  Lim Peh ka li kong, hor, if the gah'men gives me this opportunity, I sure stand up for Singapore one!

      Mahathir finally sends a Malaysian into space courtesy of the Russians. Finally, after months of training, the Malaysian astronaut and a chimpanzee are blasted off into space.   Once in orbit, the Malaysian waits for instructions. The screen flickers and the instrucions are flashed on it:   "Chimpanzee, execute space manuever No. 23B"   The chimp takes over flight control and carries out the manuever. The Malaysian astronaut is impressed but patient... he knows his instructions will come and they'll probably be more complex than what the chimp just did.   The screen flickers again and more instructions appear:   "Chimpanzee, carry out scientific experiment No. 234"   The chimp goes to the lab and mixes chemicals and carries out all sorts of complex scientific experiments. While he's doing this, the Malaysian astronaut is impatient. He speaks to Ground Control tru the comm link: "Eh Control, how come I got nothing to do man... train for so long but the monyet does all the important work but I'm smarter than the monyet"   Finally Ground Control responds: "Be patient, your instructions are coming soon"   Finally, the monkey rejoins the Malaysian astronaut and they wait for the instructions from the screen.   THe screen flickers and the message appears....   "Prepare for new instructions...."   A small door under the screen opens. Inside, there is a compartment with a wrapped item inside.....   "Malaysian astronaut, remove the item and unwrap then wait for further instructions"   The Malaysian astronaut unwraps the item and finds a banana inside. "Must be biogenetic banana" he thinks...   The screen flickers again....   "Malaysian astronaut, please feed the monkey"

      My dearest darling with long dark hair and eyes azure, My love for you is eternal, tried, and sure. I stare into the infinite depths of your eyes, But I often find my gaze directed at your thighs.  Everyone appreciates your unsurpassed beauty and grace, Your perfect supple form and enchanting face. Some say beauty is fleeting, and boy do I agree. Your personality sucks,  so when you're 40, with you I will not be.  My sweet, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways... One...uh...one...hmm...number one... gimme a chance... how about the way your body sways?  Let me once more restate my love for you. 65% of the time, to you I'm true. There is no other woman with whom I lay, At least, not at this particular time of day.  My dear, you're absolutely the best. How 'bout accompanying me to the next Centralfest? (That is, unless I don't have another date) The events that brought us together must have been fate.  I love you, I love you, I love you. You're the greatest, Jenny, I mean Cherry, I mean Sue.
