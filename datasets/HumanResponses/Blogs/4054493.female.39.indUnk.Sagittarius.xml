       My first posting to my new blog site and I really haven't the foggiest idea of what all I want to include here - but it's a work in progress, so I'll just start with this and add on and see where it takes me.    &nbsp;  For those who don't know me, my hobbies are photography, writing, reading, and scrapbooking.&nbsp; I love most sports, but baseball and softball are my favorites.&nbsp; I love music and listen to everything, but country is my favorite. I love to dance, I like to cook (but don't tell my husband - LOL) and I love to learn new things.&nbsp; I'm a voracious reader and you'll always see me with a book close at hand.    &nbsp;  That's a little about me - I'd really like to meet people and get to know them - find some common interests, etc.&nbsp; So, I guess that's it for now!

      You know, I'm always complaining to myself that I don't have any friends to hang out with.  Outside of work, I have no girlfriends to BS with, cry on shoulders of or just generally hang out with.  One of my friends at work, though, have been talking more lately and I've discovered we have A LOT in common.  Not so much our home lives (I have 5 kids - she's a furmom to one adorable bulldog), but our interests and hobbies are exactly alike.  That is so cool because it gives us something to talk about besides what's bothering us about our jobs  .   It just really makes me thankful to have someone - anyone - there to share things with.  You know - girlie things.  We can make rude comments and dirty jokes and not worry that the other will get offended.  It's so great having someone on the same wave-length as you.  There's nothing better than cracking up over a dirty joke with one of your girl-friends.  Ah, good times - good times.

      I'm sort of in a self-pity mood this morning.  The husband and I had words over the stupidest (real word?) thing the other night.  We were both looking forward to watching a show on t.v. Monday night and it was time for it to come on.  He was in the other room and shouted to me to change the t.v. to the Discovery Channel.   I shouted back - "Ok, what channel is it on?" Husband - "The  Discovery Channel"  Me - "Yeah, but what channel is that?  What number?" Husband - "I don't know - the Discovery Channel" Me - (Thinking we were joking around back & forth) - "Yes, I know, but what number channel is the Discovery Channel?"  The husband comes in, yelling and very agitated with me - "Just change the fucking channel.  Why do you always have to be like this? And you wonder why I don't want to talk to you sometimes!"  Whoa!  What?  I look at him like he's fucking insane - he's looking at me like I'm the biggest idiot bitch he's ever encountered.  I change the channel - he sits down - I get up and watch the same show in our bedroom.  And then, after seeing an especially enlightening post on a message board the next day about relationships, etc., I call him and leave a message on his voicemail that I felt bad about the argument and that I was thinking of him and I love him.  He doesn't return my call.  He doesn't even mention my phonecall when I get home last night and he's barely talking to me.  (Except when I left the house to get away from the tension, he was sure to ask me where I went).  Is it just me?  Am I really blind to the way I am - or am I really ok and it's him that's touchy and defensive?  I've been told that I drive men to drink - am I really that bad?

      When I was a girl, I never was compared to my mother. I didn't look like her, I didn't act like her, I just was nothing like her. That kind of bothered me because, unlike a lot of people I knew, I really liked my mom. She was (and still is) a very sweet woman - very easy going, but at the same time, my brothers and I knew better than to talk back to her, disrespect her in any way.  Now I'm a "grown-up" with kids of my own and my poor girls are always being compared to me. Although both my girls have blonde hair to my medium brown, our facial features are strikingly similar - as are our personalities, I'm afraid. Both my girls have my defensive mechanism in place the minute they hear anything the slightest bit negative towards them. That, my friends, is all me! We're all very conscientious of our looks and bodies - my youngest is constantly looking in the mirror - not to admire herself, but to self-criticize her shortcomings - very sad, I know, and believe me - I've tried to encourage her and convince her she doesn't have anything to worry about, but she's 15 years old and her looks are her whole life right now.  And, actually, I find myself doing the exact same thing - I pass by the mirror while dressing this morning and at first I think - "Hey, I don't look that bad...for an almost 40 year old women with three kids - I always have to add on that little disclaimer) But then I made the mistake of stopping directly in front of the full-length mirror and taking a good hard look - I was ok until I turned to see the back side - "I have back fat!!!" Having totally depressed myself for the morning, I finished dressing and went to work. Sigh...
