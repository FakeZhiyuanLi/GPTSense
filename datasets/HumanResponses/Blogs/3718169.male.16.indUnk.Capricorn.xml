      Hey i finally brought up the whole password thing after it eating at me for 2 whole days. she says that she changed it because she was bored and maybe that it was a little bit of a test to see if i was going to get on it or not. She was really upset and i told her i was sorry before i even started saying it. she told me some really deep down stuff that i am not allowed to tell no one so that means thati cant not even mention it. Im really sorry that all this had to happen to her and i thought that i had it rough man well every bodys got it rough some way or another and everyone thinks that their own problems are the worst and no one else has problems. So we are all strait on that now and i finally asked some ? that has been on my mind before we had even started dating. i know i aint been writing in here everyday im trying but i am just busy. today i got off work again and then i work 5 days strait. well i better go ill try talkin in this later if not theni will tom  m0nty188

      Hey i just got back from camping man o man was it a long time i couldnt wait to get back home there was nothing to do there and i missed my baby codi so much i cried because i am so much in a routine of seeing her every day and i couldnt do that for three whole days. so while i was away form here i wrote here a couple of letters and kissed her pictures during the day and waited until i went to bed to do so again. Yea call me a little obssessed but i dont really care i mean i really have nothing else to do except work and be with her. my best friend brad left me my other guy friend woods always hanign out with other people and all my other friends are girls and that doesnt go over with codi to well but i cant help it so what am i suppose to do i just want to hangout with my friends and really just talk about codi and see how how they been and see who they are talking to these days but i dont think that codi realizes thats all it is. i mwan im not lik eher having someone over or going over to someones house because she likes them like she did with me this is just a friend to friend thing and sometimes i need my friends to be around. I have been pondering something in my mind. a couple days before my first post i had tried to get on to codi buddypic sn but the password was changed so i decided to click on forgot password and then check her email for the password she had cahnged it to. turns out she just flipped it aorund for some reason i dont know proablly because she knew i was checking  but when i found that out i changed mine also. today when i got back since i knew the new password i had got on there to see if she had talked to anyone or made any commments that i should worry about. guess what there was it had been like two weeks since i had looked and there was one on there with this guy that she rated a ten and she has rated alot of other guys tens but that is fine because i rate other girls ten too so that doesnt bug me but the part that bugged me was that she told some other guy that he had the prettiest blue eyes and she tells me that all the time so now i dont belive her no more and i am debating wether to mess around about me having the prettiest blue eyes anymore or not. i told codi that i wouldnt check her stuff no more but it was eating at me so i had to check and i see her password changed and she wants me to trust how am i suppose to when she pulls a stunt like that. its all her fault i check her stuff anyways becasue last summer she had a b/f and talked to me all summer then we started going out and she wrote me emails and everything so now i have to check just for my own security and to make me not worry that she is doing that with some one else and she isnt with the emails yet but with bp now she is commenting other people. i dont know what to do someone please help me my aim sn is    m0nty188 if any of you have advice or even read this. so well see what happens and ill tell you the next time i wirte in here i want to try and write in here everyday but i dont know if that is possible that way i can remember eveything and if someday if codi ever ?'s what i really think she can come here and see what it is all about. i really care about my g/f codi to and she doenst think i do and she is always starting an argument of some sort she jsut cant let things go, but she has gotten better this last week about not doing that and she is spoiled to death but i am slowly tryiung to break her of that habit. tom i am going to surpise her and wake her up i am probally going to start crying when i see her because i will be so glad to finally kiss her again   Summary: what this all comes down to is that i am glad to be home and i dont have to listen to my brother talk 24/7 and not to be able to go anywhere. soon i am afraid that codi is going to start talking to someone like she did with me last summer i can just feel it happen i am so nervous i am litterally scared i  have been so scared i cant even feel it to be scared no more because its a 24/7 thing  and i pray that the stuff she tells me she means because i am taking it to heart 100%. well i g2g think and miss my g/f some more until tom morning. ill try to write tom sorry if you cant understand some stuff   m0nty188
