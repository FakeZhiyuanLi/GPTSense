      Sorry I had to post this coz it was sooo funny!   There is a factory in America which makes the Tickle Me Elmo toys, the toy laughs when you tickle it under the arm.  A new employee is hired at the Tickle Me Elmo factory and she reports for her first day promptly at 0800. The next day at 0845 there is a knock at the Personnel Manager's door. The Foreman from the assembly line throws open the door and begins to rant about the new employee. He complains that she is incredibly slow and the whole line is backing up, putting the entire production line behind schedule.  The Personnel Manager decides he should see this for himself so the 2 men march down to the factory floor. When they get there the line is so backed up that there are Tickle Me Elmo's all over the factory floor and they're really beginning to pile up.  At the end of the line stands the new employee surrounded by mountains of Tickle Me Elmo's.  She has a roll of plush red fabric and a huge bag of small marbles. The 2 men watch in amazement as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two marbles and begins to carefully sew the little package between Elmo's legs.  The Personnel Manager bursts into laughter. After several minutes of hysterics he pulls himself together and approaches the woman. "I'm sorry,"he says to her, barely able to keep a straight face, " but I think you misunderstood the instructions I gave you yesterday". "Your job is to give Elmo two test tickles".

      OMG, What a gr8 day to start this! Well sitting in science and then Boom....We've broken up. It was weird knowing that I won't see many people afta the exams and its kinda scary. Everybody was rushing round trying to get people to sign anyting and everything. It was quite emotional and a few of us, including myself had tears in our eyes. I'm gonna miss a lot of people and the stuff people wrote in my leavers book was just sweet. I just wanna take this oppurtunity to Thank everyone in Park high that made the ordeal a lot easier! All my friends, you know who you are, I love you all sooooo much! We've all had our ups and we've all had our downs but by sticking together and being there for each other we've managed to get through them! Thank you soo much, everyone who's been there for me!!!!   Anyway, Thank you all and 'GOOD LUCK' for whatever the future brings!

      Well its the first of June! Arghhhh! How freaky is this? I've already done 5 exams which were horrible but I'm so glad I've got them outa the way! I've been watching 'Hells Kitchen'! What a fab program! I mean who wud of thought that after just a week the celebrities would be able to cook for ova 70 people! It must be such a great personal achievement! God, amanda barrie trying to hit Gordon was probably the most funniest moment on tv so far this year! I want James to win, he's just a laugh really! Just as funny as when he's acting in Gimme Gimme Gimme! lol. Oh and Big Brother Looks great! Marco is definatly growing on me and want him to win, but its early days yet!

      As you can see from the picture below last week I took part in a summer school at manchester university. It was a great week and I had a laugh. With both old friends and new. Saw Spiderman 2 while I was there and thought I should comment on it. As I didn't think the first one lived up to the expectations that was set up by the media I was a bit dubious about this one. Althought my fears were thrown away after watchin the first half the film. The action is fab and the story line is also very good. Kirsten Dunst puts on a fab performance like always and Tobey Maguire is great playing Peter Parker and has improved in his role. The only bad thing about the film&nbsp;I have to say is the end. We all know that it has the romance story linked in with MJ and Parker but this is concentrated on at the end and I felt like this made the end very very cheesy! Some of the lines are really bad!  &nbsp; Anyways better go....i'll start boring you. lol
