      I've tryed many blogs and I've chosen this one to keep. I've finally learned how to put different stuff on the side-bar, which you have to do in all HTML which is harder than Nutang. I'd reccomend Blogger to all "Xangans", cuz u can customize it a lot easier. Well look back periodically   HERE!   for my posts. OUT

       I had one of these "blogger" blogs a while ago, but forgot about it, so here I made a new and improved one! I'll probably post more on here then my xanga blog, cuz when I use this one I can post stuff by email which is very cool. Well I'm gonna fix this up.

      I'm really bored. i didn't do anything today. I wanted to do something, but I didn't. I wanted to go to the movies. I went yesterday but HP:POA was sold out, so we saw The Day After Tomorrow, which I had already seen. I hope I can do something tomorrow, even though its Sunday. I might watch a movie later, maybe. Alexa is at the beach. She was attacked by fish eggs. Someone had to rescue her. Her cousin s***** me. No seriously shes s****. Well anyway, todays been boring. Good day,    SIR   !

      Well last night was lots of fun. I didn't get any sleep at all until this morning probably around 5:00. First Marcia and Alexa got up and went to Marcia's room to sleep. Then my mom got up(she usually wakes up early), and then Andrew went to my room and went to sleep! So I got on the computer, but ended up on the couch quickly. I was very tired. We ended up not rolling a house, but it was awesome just sitting outside , laying in the grass talking at night. We also played truth or dare, but I won't get into that right now . . . lol. It would be fun to have nights like that more often. Andrew also helped me with Vice City. I'm not very good at that game, but its still fun. Well if I write anymore I'm sure I would be QUESTIONED to death, so till next time, which will be tomorrow . . .   P.S.-We also went to fairmont and B****** A**** didn't show up! And it didn't rain on us, and no one got struck by lighting, and we didn't play spys, but Liz brought a pic of my sister from the newspaper, which I didn't really care that much about.

      So far my summer vacation has been fun, and I really haven't done that much. I went to see The Day After Tomorrow and It was an awsome movie. I highly reccomend it. It had awsome special fx. I went to hyperlink Cafe. I had heard of it, but had never been there, so i went with Ryan one day. We got there and there were no computers open so we played Halo for a while and by the time I played a game it was time to go. My advice is to not go on Saturdays. Well tomorrow Alexa and Andrew are coming over and it'll be great fun! Alexa's having some problems with B****** A****, so we might be spending sometime clearing somestuff up tomorrow with him . . . I'm gonna go now and play some Vice City(or another various video game), watch some tv, or I might just fall alseep . . . who knows

      My review of Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban:  First of all let me say it was one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen, and the best directed. I thought the movie lacked a good plot though. The plot was the same as the book, but the order of the events were out of place and there were'nt many conversations between the characters.      The movie is full of close-ups and artsy visuals. The director of the movie, Alfonso Cauron(hes new), has directed The Little Princess and this other movie which I forgot the name of obviously. The acting i think was a lot better than the other two films, and so were the special fx. It wasn't scary at all. The movie almost got a PG-13 rating for the "scariness", there wasn't any really scary moments, except one part with Professor Trewalny, which was jumpy.      The dementors weren't scary either. I feel that the dementors could of been made more scary than they were. I really want to see the movie again(asap). If you didn't like the first two films,you should go see this one anyways b/c, its a lot different in many ways than the other ones.   I give it as many thumbs up as possible!

      Heres a kool site where i got some cool stuff. Some of the stuff on this site is pretty serious stufF, so I wouldn't go playing with it. If you, for example, hypnotize someone or yourself, you're just gonna have to wait it out cuz their isn't a way to get them to snap out of it! DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU! If you wanna see the site click on the word >>scary

      Well today has been boring. Marcia went to Alexa's to spend the night, and the whole thing began. I was playing with this online ouija board(where u supposedly talk to spirits and ask them questions and stuff). Alexa and Marcia were on and they started playing with it, and I think I was talking with them and I said I can hypnotize you or something. I called them and Alexa wanted to be hypnotized, so I told Marcia the directions and she did everything she was supposed to do(except they kept talking when they were supposed to be relaxing), and I think Alexa fell to the ground and was asleep . . . I think. I told Marcia to tell her to bark like a chicken(I made it up), and I could hear her, and she finally awoke and said she had a dream about her grandmother being in her house, and then someone called and asked to speak with her grandmother, and then she got mail for her grandmother! Plus Marcia is trying to blame me for the whole thing, but I didn't do it, Marcia did, I just told her how to do it. Well after all tha i went with my mom to her Police Academy thing, which was suprisingly fun, and then after that I went to Books-A-Million and bought Playstation magazine. Now I found out she passed out again and she barked like a chicken. I called marcia and heard her. Well I'm pretty much obligated to figure out whats going on(especially if this keeps happening), I'm sure I can find out. . . OUT

      Well today i went ot see HP:POA again which was fun. Alexa thinks I'm mad at her but I'm not. I added a new link to the side-bar to your right. I'm about to watch a movie, maybe HP:SS. I'm currently in the process of making a flash website. I'm trying to make it a kind of portal-ish thing for all my other sites. I'm drinking grape Fanta and it aint that bad. My sisters having a Southern Living party tomorrow and i don't know what I'm gonna do during it. I might read some books for fun. I really wanna go to Books-A-Million. I want a magazine, but I don't know which one. I want an interesting book, that I might actually read. OUT

      I found out what the title of HP six is . . . its called Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. I have a pretty good guess to who it is (my new sn), but I'm not gonna say. JK Rowling has confirmed that its the official title, and that the prince is Harry nor He Who Must Not Be Named! I can't wait till this book comes out, its supposedly shorter than TheOrder of The Phoenix so thats good.

      Well today I went to Dollywood. U just can't lose when u go to Dollywood! I woke up at like 7:50 or something, and thats the earliest I've woken up this summer so far.  I spent two thirds of the time with Marcia and Claire riding stuff and then the other third I was with my mom and dad cuz I wanted to do some stuff with them. We rode everything except slidewinder, cuz I just think its boring. At one point in time during the afternoon there wasn't a line at all for TN Tornado, so we rode it a few times in a row. Tommorow I'm getting a hair-cut and I guess I'm just getting it short. I don't know I'm confused about it. Gonna go - post l8r . . .

      This is the trailer for kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, for game boy advance. You might have to wait a sec for it to load. I kinda stole the source code off Nintendo's site... is that illegal?    urlLink Click Here For The Trailer    Here are the lyrics, the lyrics in the   is the only part in this trailer.:   You don't hear me say please Oh baby, don't go Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight It's hard to let it go-->  You're giving me too many things Lately you're all I need You smiled at me and said,  Don't get me wrong I love you But does that mean I have to meet your father? When we are older you'll understand What I meant when I said "No, I don't think life is quite that simple"  When you walk away You don't hear me say please Oh baby, don't go Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight It's hard to let it go  The daily things that keep us all busy all confusing me thats when u came to me and said,  Wish i could prove i love you but does that mean i have to walk on water? When we are older you'll understand It's enough when i say so, And maybe somethings are that simple  When you walk away You don't hear me say please Oh baby, don't go Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight It's hard to let it go  Hold me Whatever lies beyond this morning Is a little later on Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before  When you walk away You don't hear me say please Oh baby, don't go Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight It's hard to let it go  Hold me Whatever lies beyond this morning Is a little later on Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before  Hold me Whatever lies beyond this morning Is a little later on Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before

      Umm, I usually post once a day, maybe twice, but I haven't posted in a while but I'm still here...  Well I think I'm gonna subscribe to Newtype USA mag. I'm getting into the anime stuff and that mag looks awesome. I might subscribe, don't know... I don't know what happened to my EGM subscription, I think my dad just stopped paying.  Its raining! Its been raining recently a lot! I think it would be kool if someone created a blog and let all of his or her friends post on it - it would probably get interesting, and also you wouldn't have to go to many different blogs - you'd go 2 just one!  Well anyways, I'm getting my dads old (not that old, Dell latitude or longitude, one of them) laptop soon. I'm hoping to just play games on it, and stuff like that. I wanna upgrade it cuz most laptops aren't really made for gaming, and this one definetly isn't, but Ill try and make it work...  I was watching I Love The 90's and I thought I'd   maybe   get a portion of it, but I really didn't get any of it V_V ... Well it was just 90 and 91, but I just thought I knew more. I think I'll know most in 96-99...  I wonder how many people actually read this...? Who cares, i don't give a crap if no one reads it... I guess I do it for my own satisfaction...? Well if you do read this, thanks... and I hope you enjoy it! Even though its a tad boring, well you might think its not, but i personally do, sometimes... I might even post things i might not when i have a bigger "audience", don't know... by the way if u actually read this please let me know by signing the chatter-box, put "I read it" and put ur real name...  I really haven't done much lately except sleep - wakeup but don't move from bed for like 30 min. - get up and get dressed - maybe go somewhere to buy something such as a mag or game (or rent a movie or game exct.) - watch some tv around 10 O' Clock - around 12:00 I get on the computer once marSHA gets off - stay on till like 2 to 3 - get off try to sleep - sleep - rinse - repeat! You could add a couple times of me playing video-games or getting on the computer also to that schedule.  This post I think  might be longest one I've actually posted, though it could be cuz of the  's... don't know. I also feel like its one of the most complete posts. Go Me!   Most people or the blogs I've read (not including the ones I've linked to) really are just the outines of the persons day, and don't tell anything really important that makes me want to come back and read it again, and isn't that the whole point of having one? People don't understand this, and they just get one cuz getting a blog is really a new fad with the people I know. Once I got an xanga someone copys you and then someone gets one after they see that person with one and so on. So, peoples, don't get one if ur not gonna post in at least every week...  Well I think i'm gonna stop here, and post tommorow, and so on.  ///peace///bbs///out///ttyl///bye///bbl///

      Tonight I went to one of my dads friends wedding. OMFG it took soooo long to get to the place, but it wasn't soo long that u wanna scream cuz if it was, I woulda, lol. It was short, which is always good. Then we went to the reception, which was across the street. Saw Matthew(Gary and Valeries [step]son, Garys my dads friend from work), which the last time I saw him was when I went to Florida on convention. We're both into video-games and computers and stuff. After we finished eating my dad helped clean the place up with everybody else, and then Matthew took me and Marcia early to the Pratt's "humble abode". Talked to some crazy drunk person when we got there(kinda scary), and then ended up watchin tv. Once everybody got there, it was pretty loud, lol, and theses crazy little kids(relatives of Deans[the groom] I guess) were just crazy. I don't think they were really old enough to watch what we were watchin', guess they're parents don't care. We left early, said our dear good-byes, and left. Simple as that. When I got home I watched some tv, and then here I am on the computer. Its funny how time flys . . . *time flyin' to my next post*

      I'm really bored... I don't know if I should stay on the computer... watch tv... or play Kingdom Hearts...     Well anyways... today my older sister, bro-in-law, brother, my mom, Marcia, and me went to Dollywood. It was fun! Dollywood really doesn't ever get old... We rode all the major rides, and the Tennessee Twister in the carnival. I got some cotton-candy as usual on the way out, and we stopped at the Fireworks Supermarket on the way home. I bought these grenade smoke bombs, some little smoke bombs, and a thing of 12-shot artillery shells(which are kool). I was gonna buy more, but I still have more leftover from the 4th.    My hands are cold...    In Kingdom Hearts I'm at the part in the Cave of Wonders in A-gra-bah. You're supposed to like hit this pole/statue thing but I can't reach it, so I'm pretty much stuck... I can't wait till I get to the Halloween town, cuz it just looks cool... Kingdom Hearts 2 is coming out next year, and I think chain of Memories is coming out this year... which I really want!    This post aint gonna be that long, cuz I gotta take the PS2 to my room, so i can play Kingdom Hearts... ™=OUT

      Well its 2:07 and I'm bored. I haven't posted in a while, so this might be long, but it might be short...    I really haven't done anything with anybody lately, such as going to the movies or the mall, or maybe even Hyperlink. Well If anybody wants to do anything, call me! Since I got season passes to Dollywood I'm going Monday. Dollywood really doesn't get old, well maybe it does after you go there a hundred times... I wouldn't know.    *leaves computer-goes to kitchen-brings back pb&amp;j oatmeal pies*    Yummm... usually these are like really nasty and crumbly, but these actually taste ok. It says on the back of the box "Little Debby Has A Snack For You." What does that mean?  These "pies" get harder the farther i get into the box...     umm next subject...    Well today I once again got on my dads laptop (soon to be mine - hehehe), and was looking at stuff... there really isn't that much stuff on it since it was ordered for the buisness... V_V. That will change soon cause I wanna put everything that I can thats mine on our "family" computer, to the laptop. I already tried direct linking the two comuters together with an ethernet cable, but for some reason it didn't work. I probably just did something wrong...    I also was looking around to see what kind of ports it had and stuff and saw that it only had one USB port, and I was looking and I saw that it didn't have a cd-rom drive, and I started freaking out. Then I figured out that theres two module thingys on the front where you can switch stuff out. There was two battery packs in, and my dad told me the cd-rom drive was at his office. Then I felt better...     I really want an iPod! I used to want a Panasonic D-Snap, but I've changed my mind. Plus since its built around a hard drive I can use it to transport files between any computers. Plus x2 it comes in different colors. I'll probably get blue or silver...    I'm hearing some weird sounds outside the window... sounded like someone coughed/fell...well anyways I just downloaded Picasa and upgraded iTunes... I don't really   need   Picasa it, but it looks kool and Google recently bought the company, I'll download anything that has to do with google, well nvm, it depends...    I'm cold... well my hands are at least...    I think I'm gonna make a post with all the videos I've put up here... so they won't all be playing on the main page... and you can go there to see one...    My head is empty... nothing to write... well, yeah there is, but i'm not gonna, lol... might write later today...

      Today I went to see The Village. My mom, larry, marcia, dad, and i went. it was the first time I had been to the movies with so many family members, kinda strange...  The movie wasn't exactly what i thought it was... I thought it was gonna end in a big battle between the people, but it didn't... go see it... after the movie we went to Cheddar's an ate. We had to wait a while to get seated, so we went and looked in Barne's And Noble's for a while. Went back over to Cheddar's waited a long time, and finally our name was called. We ate and we all watched this show on tv, and i watched a little bit of "America's Largest Amusement Park". It was about Cedar Point... I really can't decde if I want an iPod or an iPod mini...hmmmm  Alexa's all mad at me for being me... or something like that, so I really don't care if she wants to be my friend, because I guess I don't need her... If she wants to be my friend I'll be there for her, and if she doesn't, its fine with me...  I'm gonna try to go to sleep, OUT...

      Hey ppls, well today I found out who my homeroom teacher is... its (Mrs.?)Shively...  I really wanna go to school cuz it'll give me a reason to get up in the morning and hopefully it'll be as much fun as it was last year, fun as doing w/e you want and so on... But maybe it won't be as boring as Mrs.Reed and her Wordly Wise lessons... ya never know...  Oh and just for a test, if you read this just sign your name in the chatter-box to the side... just curious to see who reads this... if no one puts there name I'll just pretend I didn't write this...  I really hope I know ppl in my pod, well I hope I know at least one person in each of my classes... I'm sure I'll make new friends(never be too sure...), but its weird to not be with the exact same bunch of people you've been with for two years... hopefully I'll have some teachers resembling...  Moana... and Carleton... Lovers 4 Eva  or at least a couple to make fun of now and then...   Hopefully one techer will just shove work at you and make you do it... that would be good and bad... good cuz the teacher would maybe too caught up reading Sephen King books to notice that your listening to your ipod(cd player)... bad cuz the work would be hard since they didn't take the time to show you how to do it...  I'm excited and but don't wanna give up waking up at 12:00 every day... OUT

      I didn't right yesterday so I'm gonna start out with it...  Yesterday I went to Target and got my iPod! ONLY $273.00!!! WOOT! Well its really cool and all but i kinda can't hook it up to my computer cause i don't have  a firewire port, lol, sO i'm gonna have to go buy a firewire card really soon, once I get a check from my b-day cashed...  Today I got up at like 10:00, but then suddenly fell asleep... I set my iPod's alarm to wake me up at 9:30, but I didn't wake up, so that might not be as useful as I thought it was gonna be. I was hoping to get my check cashed today, but now my dad said i have to wait again, so hopefully that'll be tomorrow... I really want and need that firewire card so i can acctually put music on my iPod. And you can also put ur calender, contacts, and notes on there too...  Oh and I'm on pod B, and heres my schedule...   English ::: Shively Encore ::: Havell Science ::: Young Math ::: Coleman Social Studies ::: long Computer Tech ::: Dosser PE-GYM ::: Wash Found Tech Lab ::: Davis PE-Health ::: McKinney Chorus ::: Bacon   Gonna go now, bbt, t= tomorrow

      Today I helped my mom take care of my baby cousins(jon grayson[a year and some old] and lane,[some weeks, i think])... fun... lane was actually fun, all you have to do to enetertain him is make a funny(?) face and he laughs. Jon grayson just likes playing with his thomas the train toys, their fun too... i was coloring in a coloring book with him, and he skribbled on my masterpiece...  Tomorrow I'm going to Target to buy an iPod! Woot! Well its not the new one, or the mini, its the 3rd generation, but its the second greatest!!! Once you think about it, its cooler than the new one anyways. It has cool touck buttons that glow orange in the dark and the new one just has a grey click-wheel(boring, but still cool).  I'm gonna go now and maybe I'll post tomorrow, and tell ya if I got it or not...
