       I know rivers.  It’s in my bones. (Not my blood, no.  Deeper.)  I've had stories handed down to me—dreams, warnings.  Some things I witnessed, myself.  Rivers are strange things.  They're beautiful, but give them time and they can cut through rock.  You may ask yourself, "Are these stories true?" Remember, the river rushes away from its origin. All it cares for is finding the sea.   ***  The Rappahannock River swallowed my uncle twenty years ago, carrying him with a ton of silt, leaves, and fish to the Atlantic Ocean.  A policeman who kept his hands clasped behind his back delivered the news: “We found his shoes and pants on the dock, so we think your husband dove in to rescue his friend.  We haven’t found his body, but the river was rough that day and the water was very cold.  We don’t have much hope.” My aunt took the news graciously, thanking the policeman and asking him inside for a cup of tea.  (Heart hammering against her ribcage.)  He declined.  She shut the door and sank to the floor.  The policemen never found his body.  Last spring my uncle's bones washed up onto the riverbank.  (Though the skull had long since been carried into the ocean.)  An old woman wandered along the river and found his bones.  The woman sang a happy song as gathered the bones up in her skirt.  “Bones a good good find, good to make crafts.” She spent weeks assembling his remains into jewelry, stringing finger and toe bones together into handsome bracelets.  Then the old woman put the jewelry for sale in her tourist shop.  She also put up a sign that claimed the necklaces were “hand-crafted with ancient fossil bones.” The occasional tourist visited her shop, ambling through dull postcards and brittle fudge.  Once, a sullen teenager bought a toe-bone brooch and wore it to prom to spite her mother, who only shopped from catalogues.  Most people walked past the bone jewelry.  My aunt, of course, never stopped searching the river all those years.  She just drifted along in a wooden rowboat, humming softly and parting waves with her palm.  She knew that, like a little boy tiring of his toys, the Rappahannock River would let my uncle go.  It was only a matter of time.  My family, we know rivers.  When my aunt arrived at the bay, she ate lunch at a restaurant overlooking the sea.  She ate grilled salmon and a piece of chocolate cake.  When her belly was full, she wandered down the street and into the old woman’s shop.  Of course she stopped at the display of bone jewelry.  After turning a necklace over and over in her hands, she decided to try it on.  It fit perfectly around her throat and she remembered the first time she made love to my uncle—camping in the Catskills, in late October.  (She kept on her hat, wool socks and gloves, on account of the cold.)  She cried and wiped her nose on her sleeve, trying not to make a scene in the tourist shop.  My aunt realized that the bones belonged to her husband.  She bought all the jewelry and went home.  (The old woman was happy to make such a profit; bones are a lucky find.) And ever since, my aunt wears the bone jewelry under her clothes, close to her skin, rattling as she walks.  I have seen them peeking out from her collars and cuffs.   ***  My mom tells the story another way.    Searchers dragged the river with huge nets, “large enough to catch a whale,” news reporters said.  Yet, seven days after my uncle drowned, the searchers still hadn’t found his body.  Distraught, my mom went to bed and prayed to Flossy, her great-grandmother.  When she talks about that night, she says: “Flossy was a fisherwoman on the Ohio River.  She knew all the creeks and pools and streams, she knew where to find the biggest trout and the sweetest water.  I knew that she could find Uncle Lee, so I prayed to her.  I remember saying, ‘Flossy, please find him and bring him home to his family.’ I kept praying and praying until I either fell asleep or crossed over, and the bed became a raft and I was floating down the river with Flossy.  She took me to a waterfall and we got onto the bank.  I asked, ‘What are we doing?’ Shushing me, she pointed back at the river and Lee was there, floating in the water.  He smiled at me, then flowed over the waterfall.  And the next morning, the searchers called up grandma and said they found Uncle Lee’s body—at the base of a waterfall.”   ***  Of course my family has other river stories.  The oldest one goes back several centuries, to an ancestor who survived a shipwreck in 1753.  Nathaniel Scott was eleven years old when he traveled down the Mississippi River, heading towards the Gulf of Mexico.  The cargo was cotton and sugar and gowns for rich ladies.  Cotton picked by the raw fingers of slaves.  Fifty-pound bags of sugar, lugged on their backs, rough fabric cutting skin.  Silk gowns ironed by women who were forced to lift their skirts for any man.  This was the precious cargo.  Sometimes nature revolts, barring ships passage—that’s why slave ships line the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.  And sometimes the river revolts, bucking and braying.  Where the Mississippi flowed into the gulf, a mammoth rock reared up out of the river and struck the starboard side.  The wood planks broke readily, spitting out the nails hammered into them.  The ship sank two hours later, not far from the riverbank.  Silk gowns floated to the surface, sashaying along the waves, and the water there is sugar-sweet to this day.  Nathaniel Scott struggled his way ashore—the only one of his crew to survive the merciless Mississippi.  The plantation owners, furious over their loss of valuable goods, asked Nathaniel to give an account of the wreckage.  He told them of ship that sank too easily, of water that frothed around the heads and hands of drowning men.  He was spared because he was only a boy.    And someone had to live to bear witness.  When my mom was pregnant, she planned on naming the baby Nathaniel Scott.  “Nathaniel means a ‘gift from God,’” she said.  “It’s a good, strong name.”  During a sonogram, doctors told my parents that something was wrong with the baby.  His heart, lungs, and liver were in the wrong places.  And his brain was not forming the right way.  He would not survive for long.  Before he passed away, I dreamt of a river.  I swam through milky waters and my unborn brother paddled with me.  We tumbled and laughed, spinning through the waves.  Eventually we came to the forbidden sea, and I went ashore.  My brother thrashed in the waves, laughter followed by shrieks.  The water had turned into ammonia, and an invisible wall formed in front of me.  I couldn’t help him.  His body passed through the river and into the sea.  I was left crying onshore.   ***  Years ago, my father fell asleep as he rocked my cradle.  “In my dream, I put you in a basket and sent it downriver.  You splashed around in the water, plucking plump fish from the river, which you swallowed whole.  Then you fished out a scroll from the river, this old scroll which unraveled in your hands.  When you threw it back into the river, the water turned red—which scared the hell out of me.”  He told me this story whenever we went fishing for steelheads in the Calumet River.  Each summer we’d cast the lure, then sit on the bank and talk for hours.  (“Catching a steelhead takes patience,” he said.  “But it’s worth the wait if you catch one.  They’re huge during the summer run—some even bigger than you.”)  There wasn’t much to do besides talk, so he told me about our family history and politics and nature.  Dad also told me about his hopes for me, which always connected back to the dream.  “I think the scroll you got from the water means you were blessed.  It was a gift from the river.  You’ll do something great someday.  I know it.”  Once, when I was nine, we actually caught a steelhead.  Dad wrestled with the pole and fell backwards, but managed to reel it in.  When we got home, he put the fish on the kitchen counter.  I watched the fish gasping in the air, its fins fluttering.  I begged dad to take the fish back and release it into the river.  He refused, and I burst into tears.  “But he’s going to die.”  Dad patted me on the head.  “I know, sweetie.”  “He’s suffering!”  He reached out to hug me, but I ran upstairs to my bedroom and slammed the door.  I flung myself onto the bed, crying into the pillow.  That evening, my dad sprinkled lemon on the fish, then baked it for dinner.  I felt sick to my stomach just looking the pink flesh.  I pretended to eat some, but wrapped my bit in a napkin when he wasn’t looking.  Later, I unearthed the fish’s bones from the garbage.  Sneaking outside, I took the fish remains and buried it in the backyard.   ***  When I was a baby, my mother also had a dream about me and a river.    She never told me what happened in the dream, save that I drowned.  When I was five years old, she began to teach me how to fight the river.  For the first lesson, she rowed us out to the middle of Lake Antoine.  "This is a good place to start," she told me.  "Lakes are quiet."  Then, mom grabbed me and threw me overboard.  I screamed, swallowing water.  I thrashed around, legs kicking, arms reaching for the rowboat.  Sputtering, I cried for my mother.  The lake met every desperate breath with more water, flooding my mouth and ears and nose.  Even when my head broke the surface, water splashed into my face so that I sank, choking, breathless.  I began to struggle less and sink deeper.  I was drowning. Mom pulled me out of the water then.  Desparate to grip something, I scratched up her arms.  She tried to pull me onto her lap, but I pushed her away, coughing, sobbing.   She wrapped a blanket around me and rowed to shore.  We watched the sunset in silence.   Water nested in my eardrums, making me deaf until the following morning.   When I regained my hearing, I demanded to know why she threw me into the lake.  “You needed to feel what it’s like when water wins,” she said simply.  There were more lessons after that.  Mom taught me how to trick a river when it tries to pull you under: “The river expects you to swim to the surface for air, right? So you fool the river by diving down deeper.” I laughed when she told me this, declaring that the last thing a drowning person should do is swim deeper in the water.  That afternoon we went swimming in a fast-moving river, water churning around our heads.  Mother navigated the current with a powerful, direct breaststroke.  I met the roiling water with the crawl stroke, making splashes with each kick and reach.  However, the crawl stroke was too frenzied for the unruly river and I struggled to keep pace with mom.  The river began to pull me downwards, even as I strove to keep my head above water.  Remembering mother’s counsel, I dived down below the turbulent waves—down deep where the river is calm, where fish laze about and silt remains unstirred.  Then I rose to the surface and, peaceful, let my body follow the flow.         Mom tried to teach me how to skip stones on Copper River.  Cold water lapped at our feet as we searched the sand for skipping stones.  I found a handful of gray, pock-marked rocks; she chose flat, black ones.  “You have to flick your wrist and let the stone just roll out of your hands,” she said, skipping one across the water.  I sunk stone after stone, while she sent hers sailing along the waves.  She dumped her rocks into my cupped hands saying, “Maybe we should trade.” And she watched while each stone landed in the water with a weighty splash.  “You have to learn how to make the stones dance,” she told me, putting her hand on my shoulder.    “When you skip stones across water, the river knows you will not drown.  These stones refuse to sink, and instead skip along the water two, three, six times.  When you skip stones, the river knows you can dance over it just as easily as a heavy rock refusing to sink.”  She looked out over the churning water. “I'll be damned if I let the river take you away from me.”   ***  Years later I stood on London Bridge, gripping the railing.  The Thames wasn't poetic—it was raw, industrial.  The water was muddy.  Red planks drifted along the surface, sometimes dipping below the waves like hungry ducks.  I felt sad, watching the Thames flow.  Bridges bound the river and sidewalks manacled it.  It was an old, feeble thing brimming with two thousand years of garbage.  I wanted to offer myself to the river.  I wanted to strip off my clothes—right there, on the busy bridge—and dive in.  Let the water swell into my mouth and lungs.  Let the current tie my hair in knots.  Lay my bones to rest in the silt.  So I stood there, wringing the railing, tears on my cheeks.  But I couldn't do it.  Newspapers and schooners and ducks floated passed me on the muddy current.  Stooping down, I plucked a stone from the ground.  It was tear-shaped, gray.  Chipped on one side.  I squeezed the stone tight, whispering.  “Take it from me.  Take it all from me.”  Then, kissing the stone, I slung it at the river.  The stone skipped three times before sinking down deep into the riverbed.  Sometimes I think that stone is slowly rolling across the ocean floor, finding its way back.  And many years from now, I will stoop to pluck that same stone from the sand.  It will be lighter, smoother.  I'll smile, thinking of my aunt who, in time, wrapped up my uncle's bones and stored them in her dresser.    Then I'll send the stone dancing across the water.

         But consider what value, what meaning is enclosed even in the smallest of our daily habits, in the hundred possessions which even the poorest beggar owns: a handkerchief, an old letter, the photo of a cherished person. These things are part of us, almost like limbs of our body; nor is it conceivable that we can be deprived of them in our world, for we immediately find others to substitute the old ones, other objects which are ours in their personification and evocation of our memories.  -Primo Levi,  If This is a Man     I'm almost done packing. The dresser, desk, vanity, and bookshelves are empty. The framed portraits of women from  National Geographic , the windchimes, the decorative plates are all wrapped in newspaper.  Even the unimportant things--pencils, nail clippers, old shoes--are in boxes.  It's so strange to see the windows without curtains, the white walls. Maybe that's why I haven't packed anything this afternoon. It's silly, really.  I'm almost done packing.  All that's left is a few books, some appliances, and jewelry. Four, maybe five boxes, at the most. An hour's work. But I haven't packed a thing.    It doesn't seem possible that I'm moving to the Mississippi Delta. I've never been that far south; I can't picture the region. Of course, I know the South through movie cliches--sweet tea, the Baptist Church, cotton fields, scowling white men.  But I know movies don't show the full scope of the region.  I can't picture Mississippi, so I can't picture my things there.  Packing is part of the journey. These objects evoke memories--help me remember where I've gone, how I was led to Mississippi.  I've been sifting through old letters, dried flowers, poetry, photographs.  Last night, I found the boxed flowers--dried flowers I keep in little necklace boxes.  I have Queen Anne's lace I picked in the woods on the morning I left for college.  In another box, I have a rose from a summer--and a man--I'd like to forget.  I thought about throwing that flower away, but it's an important memory. I also spent time looking through photographs from prom. I was a beautiful girl then, but I hated myself. It's a lesson, I guess, to remember how near-sighted I can be.  The books.  I love going through books, because I stuff mementos in them and forget they're there.  In Jeanette Winterson's  The Powerbook , I found a card Jennifer gave to me before I went to England. In it, she said she wasn't worried about me. She knew I'd have a "wonderful adventure."  In that book, I also found an advertisement for strip clubs in Paris.  Come again.  (I love that the poster is from France, but it's written in English.)  I thought about throwing that away, but decided against it. Who knows when I'll come across it next?  Will I remember the story behind it then?  Or will I just shake my head and think,  God I'm so weird ?  Almost everything I own has a story. Books, receipts, blankets, stockings--you name it. I especially love my furniture. I have a bedroom set, which includes a bed, dresser, and vanity, from the 1930's. An old woman owned the set until she moved into a nursing home.  There were no scratches on it when my mom bought it.  It's made with a beautiful honey-colored wood.  My kitchen table and chairs comes from my Great-grandma Irene, who passed away in November 2002.  Her house was the center of family gatherings for holidays, weddings, and get-togethers.  And that kitchen table groaned under the weight of pies, turkeys, cakes, and casseroles for thirty years.  Now, I own the table.  It's not the prettiest table, but it's sturdy.  I look forward to having it for years.  Right now, I'm in the process of trying to convince my dad to give me the china from his marriage to my mom.  He never uses it, and I have so few things from their marriage.  (Outside some wedding pictures, a spice rack and, well, me, it's like it never happened.)  It's important to me, but I don't think he'll let me have it now.  The china has a delicate pattern of perriwinkle, lavendar, and white flowers on the edge.  It's called "Beloved."  Last night, as we watched for tornados, my brother and I were talking about packing.  He said, "It's interesting that your whole life, all your things, are reduced to a few boxes. It's like,  How many boxes is your life worth ?"

       "Ms. Polk!  Ms. POLK!"  I'm greeted every morning by fourteen students tugging my shirt, calling my name, hugging me, telling me stories, and tattle-taling.  Even though I've only been teaching since last Monday, I can't imagine a time when I wasn't a teacher.  (Except in that nostalgic "I remember those days when I slept in past 5:15 a.m. and wasn't responsible for students' lives and didn't have to call their parents" kind of way.)  I've learned so much already.  And even though I'm in a state of constant frustration with myself, I know I'm a good teacher.  Not "properly trained and certified" good, but good for the tools I have.  I don't know where to start talking about my experiences in Houston.  I have all these thoughts running in my head--about the ESL students who struggle to understand rhyming poetry.  About Jordan, possibly the smartest kid in the class, who pretends like he doesn't care.  About how Maria is just so desperate for a smile.  About how annoying Brad's attitude can be.  (Although he has improved since I reprimanded him for calling a girl "fat" as we walked down the hall. I told him: "Get against the wall.  I know you're a smart boy.  I know you can be a hard worker when you choose to be.  I know that there are times when you are finished before other kids, and I'm working to help you find challenging things to do.  But I  will not  tolerate your attitude anymore, and you will never say anything disrespectful things to another students in my class.  Can you explain to me why you choose to bully other students?")  And Samantha.  How on earth do I keep this brilliant brilliant girl challenged and engaged?  How do I negotiate her turbulent emotions?  This second-grade girl who reads on a seventh-grade level, but has the social skills of a kindergartener.  This girl who burst into tears today when I changed her "consequence card" and told me that her mom said, "You can't see your dad if we get another phone call home from Ms. Polk."  This girl who, yesterday, sucked on her arm until there was a huge hickey, then kept digging her pencil into the sore.  Self-mutilation.   In a second grader.   (That happened when Mr. Northern, my colleague, rotated into the class for their science lesson.)  It's so difficult to be teaching a class with second through fifth graders.  We have some students who are still perfecting their fine motor skills, while others are entering puberty.  "Differentiation" is Teach For America's big thing--meeting the needs of all students.  This summer is kicking my ass, in terms of learning to differentiate.  BUT, when I go to Mississippi, I will know how to handle working with students of differing levels.  Yesterday was the most difficult day for me.  It was difficult because our class literally exploded.  First, Samantha mutilated her arm.  Then three Latino boys ganged up on the only Black boy in the class during lunch.  Ms. McDonald, the other member of my collaborative group, dealt with them then.  However, when they were walking back to class, another comment was made.  The Black boy started crying.  So, first self-mutilation and then racial slurs.  But the fun doesn't stop there.  Then, when I was walking them to dismissal, Brad made the comment about Maria's weight.  (That's when I told him, with my meanest teacher voice, to get against the wall.)    But, wait!  There's more.  I called Malachi's mother to talk about his homework and his struggles with converting a brainstorm into a paragraph.  I told her that I hadn't gotten a chance to work with him because of misbehavior in the class.  She asked me what happened, and I informed her that there were some issues of bullying in the classroom.  (I felt that it was important to be frank.)  That's when she said: "On that note, Malachi doesn't want me to say anything, and he's afraid to say something himself, but some of the fourth and fifth graders are picking on him."  On the inside, I died.  But, maintaining some sense of professionalism, I thanked her for communicating with us and told her that we planned on devoting an hour to discussing diversity and RESPECT.  So, self-mutilation, racial slurs, fat jokes, and second graders getting bullied.  In.  One.  Day.  This morning, during our Math-Literacy Hour, we spoke about respect.  (Math-Literacy Hour is a time from 8:00 to 9:00 am when all three teachers are in the classroom together.  We do more activity-driven, game-type things in smaller groups.  The groups are split into beginner, medium, and advanced.  On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday we teach reading and/or writing; on Tuesdays and Thursdays we teach math skills.)  We talked for a while about how put-downs make us feel.  Then we had them do an activity.  We passed around fourteen sheets of paper, each with one student's name across the top.  Every student had to write a compliment for that person.  ("You are nice" and "You are pretty" weren't allowed.  Also, they had to initial their compliments.  And when students came across their own paper, they had to write something about themselves that made them proud.)  This activity worked SO WELL!  It really helped to set the tone of respect.  I love my students.  I'm sad that I won't be able to stay and watch them grow.  We had one student who moved back to Mexico.  (The circumstances were never explained to us.  He just was  gone  one day.)  He was an ESL student who struggled with English.  However, before he left, he wrote a poem in his journal:  I feel the wind that move. the leaves and I see to the grass that is very green the dirt is brown and the sky is blue. from here there from there to here this is in everywhere.   This poem.  I was so proud.  And I wish I had some way to contact him--to tell him, keep writing, keep trying.  That he's a hard worker, and that's so important in life.  And how beautiful is this poem?  A fifth grade ESL student who moved back to Mexico.  "This is in everywhere."  Houston isn't anything like I expected.  Nor is Texas for that matter.  For example, I went to see  Fahrenheit 911  and the crowd gave it a standing ovation.  In TEXAS!  That surprised me, but the rain surprised me even more.  It rains everyday in Texas.  I'm not exaggerating.  It rains every single day, even if it's just a little sprinkle.  Houston is lush and green.  Parts of Texas look the same as, well, Central Illinois.  Flat, green, railroads, worn-down houses.  And I have not seen a single person wearing a cowboy hat!  My school, Wainwright Elementary, isn't what I expected it to be.  It's supposedly a "bad school" in the sense that it's under-resourced, under-staffed, etc.  But it's a nice school.  My classroom has leaves painted across the entire wall.  On the closet doors, there's a painting of "The Giving Tree."  It's so beautiful.  The library has "Where the Wild Things Are."  My Faculty Adviser, a veteran teacher, is so amazing.  I've learned so much from her about behavioral management, planning fun  and  effective lessons, and elementary literacy.  She's a great teacher.  And there's such warmth in the school.  Everyone knows everyone.  Teachers know families, students know administrators, I love hanging with Ms. Carol, our bus driver.  There is one bad thing about the school.  There are "portables" in the back.  Portables are like, well, trailer homes.  The same size and shape, except they are classrooms.  I haven't visited the portables yet, because the "promotional" students are there.  (Promotional students are the ones who need to be taught remedial skills.)  I'm teaching enrichment, which means that the students will go on to the next grade, whether or not they pass my class.  That may seem nice, but it comes with it's own challenges.  The enrichment kids aren't required to be there.  So, if our lessons are boring, then they will drop out.  This reflects poorly on us--Ms. McDonald, Mr. Northern, and me.  So that's a challenge.  We have to constantly think: "How can I make this fun?  Should I create a chant, scavenger hunt, debate, pantomime, etc?"  I suppose Teach For America would say that a good teacher should always think about how they can better engage students.  (I agree, but it can be draining.  They don't let us use text books  at all , which I think is a little unrealistic.  In most regions, we will be required to use text books.  And Teach For America isn't teaching us how to utilize, evaluate, or incorporate them.  I understand that they don't want us to rely on "what a book says," but I think it might mess me up once I start teaching.)  Anyway, I've tried to write as much as I can.  Teach For America is big on teacher reflection journals.  TFA alumns are always reading inspiring stories from their journals.  Everyone in TFA is uber-eloquent, which makes me feel out-of-place in a way.  Because I haven't been writing for a while.  I know I can write...but I haven't.  But I need to not be too hard on myself.  I've been very hard on myself.  I make myself cry sometimes, thinking about things I have or haven't done.  It's scary to be entrusted with  children,  who are so impressionable.  I try to do my best.  But sometimes I feel so lost in this seige of information.  (I wrote "sea of information" first, but "seige" seemed a more accurate word.  Or is it "beseiged"?)  I guess, because I feel that I was such a failure last year...Well, I'm afraid of failing at this.  And if I fail at this, then I will fail at everything.  See?  Thoughts like these are what make me write "I need to not be too hard on myself."  But this is serious business.  This is children.  Not college, which is such a self-indulgent time.  I'm responsible for other people.  But my kids make me smile.  I get excited when they're excited.  I love that they do impressions of me behind my back.  (They make huge gestures, because I gesticulate a lot when I explain things.)  And I'm so happy when they show me work they're proud of.  Now I have to put my "Ms. Polk" hat back on, go to my room, and grade homework.  Then I have to read their journals and make comments.  (I never knew how long responding to journals can take!)  And then, before I go to bed, I need to finish making my manipulatives (learning materials students can move around, touch, play with, etc).  Tomorrow, I'm teaching them about free verse poetry.  (It's gonna blow them away.  So far, I've been teaching them that the four parts of poetry are "Double S, Double R"--Shorter lines, Stanzas, Rhyme, and Rhythm.  Tomorrow, I get to take rhyme out of the equation.)  We're making tanka poems, just so their free verse poems are short and have some structure.  (I can't take away rhyming and say, "Okay, now anything goes."  I have to show them a formula for creating free verse poems.)  I made magnetic poetry words.  I'm so excited to have them make their own poems.  My CMA (Corps Member Adviser) says that I plan good lessons that engage students while having them practice the actual material being learned.  (Instead of just being "creative" with activites.)  That makes me happy.  Now if I could just get the discipline a little more under control.

        a bee on the sidewalk pinned down by rain  -a haiku written in Decatur, IL    I spent this morning planting Begonias in the garden.  I'm trying to soak up nature before I go to Houston.  I like cities, I do.  But I just feel  off  when I'm in urban areas for too long.  I start finding nature in interesting places when I'm in the city.  Once, I watched a balloon caught in tree branches for 15 minutes.  It was one of those accidental beauty moments that Milan Kundera writes about in  Unbearable Lightness of Being .  If I hadn't packed the book already, I'd find the quote.  Basically he writes--with great eloquence--that beauty in the countryside is obvious.  A flower, tree, sunset.  But in the city, any beauty people find is accidental.  Decatur, IL., was one of the ugliest cities I've been in--industrial, polluted.  So, in my head, I started to think of things in terms of nature.  Like, trains were bellowing animals (a terrible cliche) or dams holding back currents of traffic.  And, outside of nature, I just started to appreciate its own humdrum beauty.  Big porches, sweet tea, girls with ribbons in their hair.  The general run-down look.  I hope that Houston's natural side will sneak up on me, too.  Okay, enough with nature.    I'm having second thoughts about Teach For America.  Not,  Maybe I shouldn't do this , but  What the hell have I gotten myself into ?  I was reading more theoretical stuff last night, and I got really anxious.  I had to stop reading, stop thinking.  It's just that I'm starting to doubt my ability to do this.  There's so much to remember, and I'm just afraid I'm going to make some grave mistake that will ruin my students for all eternity.  I don't really believe this, but last night I was freaking out.  There's just so many little things to remember, so many passages I've starred, underlined, high-lighted.  I write myself notes in the margins:  Jenna, DO THIS!

       I finished packing.  (The process had become less nostalgia-inducing and more exhausting by Friday morning.)  Then my dad and brother drove me to the bus station in Bloomington.  I was nervous, because I've never taken a bus before.  (Of course, I  have  taken Trans-Atlantic flights to London and Haifa, Israel, but that's just how I work.  I get nervous about traveling in new modes of transportation--and to new places, for that matter.  It's silly, but I'm still a small-town girl at heart.)  When it was time to board the bus, my brother hugged me somethin' fierce and even kissed my cheek.  (This is the boy who gets pissed-off when I tousle his hair.)  I will miss him.  He's been my sidekick for the past two years.  The bus ride was long and cramped and boring.  I was disappointed by the Chicago Greyhound Station.  Having been to O'Hare Airport and Heathrow, I was expecting something bigger.  It didn't even have a gift shop.  Only bathrooms, seating areas, and vending machines--nothing to distract from its functional purpose.  Between Chicago and Milwaukee, I sat with a middle-aged nurse named Brenda.  We talked about good recipes for greens, nursing, Michigan, and the healing properties of water.  When the man in front of her recline his seat, she hit his back.  I assumed they knew each other until she started ranting about "some people..."    Three transfers, two time-zones, and sixteen hours later, we arrived in Iron Mountain.  My back has hurt like hell ever since.  I can only imagine how much fun  thirty-five hours  on the bus to Houston will be.  But I'm grateful that buses cost much less than airplanes.  Right now, it's worth the hassel.   ***   Now I'm home.  I finished packing my suitcase.  (I think I've over-packed, but that's okay.  It's better to have too much than too little when it comes to long trips.)  I spend my days reading serious articles like "Start With Standards," "Teaching For Understanding: 'Getting Into Your Students' Minds,'" and "Creating and Implementing Effective Rules and Consequences."  It's pretty amazing, how much I've learned about teaching already.  When I get around to applying to grad school, I'll be uber-prepared for a teaching assistantship.  In the meantime, I just hope I'm ready for the Summer Institute in Houston--or what I like to call Teacher Boot Camp.  Or, One Big Five-Week-Long Ass-Kicking.  The sample daily schedule is pretty intense.  I'll have to get up around 5:50 to have breakfast between 6:20 and 6:50, then activities are planned from 6:50 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., with 30 minutes for lunch and 75 minutes for dinner.   Aye, Carumba!    The best times are when I can just go outside and wander around.  The garden looks amazing.  Mom has wrangled me into helping her water the garden and plant some Impatiens, Violets, Dusty Millers, and Marigolds.  This doesn't sound like much until you've seen her garden.  Her garden slopes down into our orchard, fences in our house, and runs down another hill.  She's got eight normal-sized beds, two rose bush hedges, a wall of lilacs, and three gigantic beds.  (They're probably twenty-five feet long and three feet wide each.)  So, I've got some work cut out for me.  But I love just digging my hands in the dirt, especially after it rains.  The chickens hang around when we garden, pecking at the turned-up worms.  Speaking of chickens, my sister saw two mating for the first time.  Since she's eleven and  changing , such topics are of utmost importance.  She told me, "I saw the chickens   mating. The rooster was, like, holding her down with his claws and ripping out her feathers.  And she was stickin' her butt up in the air, but her face was mushed in the dirt."  My mom, who overheard our conversation, said: "Now you know why I don't have any feathers, honey."  Many bawdy jokes followed, inducing my sister to run upstairs shrieking, "You GUYS!"

       Because this journal is for "recording the journey," I'm posting an email exchange between a teacher-friend and me.  Meg, who researches teaching strategies in low-income communities, sent me this advice:  1. Confidence is key. You must always be confident in your decisions as a teacher. By this I don't mean that you have to discipline every second or be mean, but, if you don't discipline, you sure as hell better have a mean, confident stare. If you think back, I bet you remember that your best teachers never sent anyone to the office, because no one ever fronted on them.  2. Don't try to make every lesson earth-shattering and spectactular. I tried to do this and wore myself out. The kids don't expect every lesson to be moving and perfect and exciting. Some days you are just goign to have to pass out a worksheet, and that's that. But do try to be great every chance you can.  3. It is less important that you enforce the "rules," than that you try to figure out why certain kids are always breaking the rules. Get beneath the surface on the "trouble" kids, and they may become your best students.  4. Don't praise too often or the kids will stop believing you.   ***   I sent her this email, "Ramblings of a young, inexperiences teacher-to-be," on May 10, 2004:  Meg, thank you so much for the much needed encouragement.  Right now, I'm in the middle of a crash course on teaching theory coupled with school observations.  Teach for America's philosophy is that students should have a (measurable) BIG GOAL to work towards, something that motivates them and their families, makes the teacher purposeful in all lesson-planning, and causes her to continually self-evaluate her teaching practices.  (A la Calculus teacher Jamie Escalante from  Stand and Deliver .)  Okay.  So I'm getting that.  I got totally lost on the whole lesson-planning unit--especially the part about grouping the state's standards into like content and then ordering them.  Also the part about planning goal-based, project-based, or theme-based units.  I've got a feeling that I'm going to lose a grip on the theoretical stuff when I actually get there.  *sighs*  I am excited that the material is all geared towards teaching within low-income communities.  Lots of discussions about poverty, culture, prejudices, sensitivity, importance of involving parents, etc.  There's so much talk about these things that I can't imagine learning teaching theory without having these discussions.  (I remember you complaining at MU that there wasn't enough discussion.)   I was happy to read your advice.  The thing about not complimenting them too much sounded strange but made perfect sense.  I also liked the idea that not all lessons have to express something deep, profound, human, mysterious, etc.  I think I'm gonna have a hard time with the whole "It's not personal, there's something deeper, something behind the misbehavior, and if you just find it, you can stop it and change the kid's life" thing.  I tend to take things personally.  (It's a fault of mine, I know.)  So, I was wondering if you could explain your advice on that particular subject a little more, whenever you get the chance.   I'm really excited about making a fun, colorful classroom.  I know, I should probably be more excited about making sound lessons...but how cute are elementary classrooms?!  I remember reading something in a feminist class that it's important to have both primary and jewel colors, because boys' toys are generally in primary colors, while girls' toys are in jewel colors.  So when girls get to school and everything is in primary colors, it's an environment they're already at-odds with.   In my readings, I'm trying to figure out the balance between maintaining a sense of order and efficiency and feeling like a Nazi.  I mean this business of kids always having to raise their hands or walking single-file with their hands clasped in front of them...well, sounds a little facist.  Of course, Teach for America makes a good point about needing to maximize efficiency, so that you don't lose valuable teaching time.  Still, I was never one to feel that kids should be so...uniform in their actions.  Kids are messy, squirmy, excitable, strange little devils.  What's your take on that, Ms. Schleppenbach?   Okay.  I've got to go and do more observations.  On Friday, I observed a teacher who I was an aide for in high school. She let me read a story to the kids.  That was fun.  All the teachers refer to me as Ms. Polk.  That's a trip, but I suppose I should get used to it.   Your friend, Ms. Polk   PS  They use corporal punishment where I'm going to teach.  That's very scary.

       It's like this: you crest over a wooded hill and see the Delta.&nbsp; It's flat and green.&nbsp; Groves of trees make ridges in the horizon.&nbsp; Fields of cotton, soy, rice.&nbsp; Mist rises up from the fields at sunset.&nbsp; Everything's lazy and hot.&nbsp; You feel like you're breathing in steam.&nbsp; There are creepers that cover everything--trees, houses, rusted-out cars.&nbsp; On Route 61, you pass through&nbsp;small towns.&nbsp; Old men sit in lawn chairs smoking cigarettes.&nbsp; Kids roll tires down the streets.&nbsp; When you drive past, people wave.&nbsp; Sometimes they smile.  About fifteen minutes inside the Delta, I saw a&nbsp;long brick building.&nbsp; The roof was caved-in.&nbsp; Creepers strangled the stairs.&nbsp; The windows were boarded-up.&nbsp; Rust.&nbsp; I thought,  Maybe this is an abandoned office building. &nbsp; Then I saw the merry-go-round, swings, and teeter-totters.&nbsp; It was a school.&nbsp; An old, abandoned, shelled-out school.&nbsp; The realization cut through me.  Now I'm home in beautiful Marianna, AR.&nbsp; The houses are small, quaint--though many students live "across the tracks."&nbsp; There's a huge statue of General Robert E. Lee in the town square.&nbsp; There are many magnolia trees and butterfly bushes.&nbsp; I'm excited to live in town, but the race for housing is an&nbsp;intense, cut-throat business.&nbsp; Right now, I'm hoping to live in a house downtown that's been split into three apartments.&nbsp; It has hardwood floors, kitchen appliances, many windows, a bedroom, living room, bathroom, and a "breakfast room."&nbsp; (It's a room that's too small to be a dining room, but it's connected to the kitchen.)&nbsp; Also, the owner said I could bring my cat, Mora, to live with me.&nbsp; It's the perfect neighborhood.&nbsp; There are two apartments available, which means that there'd be two teachers living as neighbors.&nbsp; However, there are three people interested in the apartments.&nbsp; The tension--real or imagined--is making me sick.&nbsp; We've decided, as a community, to research all available housing in town,  then  decide who lives where.&nbsp; If I don't live in these apartments, then I'll be looking for housing in Forest City, which is twenty minutes away.&nbsp; I'm afraid to live that far, knowing my tendency to isolate myself.&nbsp; I hate the prospect of fighting for housing, but I can't be a pushover.&nbsp; I feel my happiness hinges on living in this apartment.

       "I want to see good posture--now!"  I'm a stickler for students having good posture.  I don't know why, really.  I have terrible posture myself.  But I've been saying this for so long that students have internalized it.  When I call out "good posture," I get this: spines snapped straight, folded hands on desks, feet on the floor, eyes forward.  It's an amazing sight.  But this morning, Dwight wouldn't sit straight.  I said "good posture," and he still was slumped over on the table.  I reminded him twice, but to no avail.  And that stubborn streak in me flared up.   I said "good posture," dammit, so you should be sitting up straight.  But you're just slumped over on your desk, not paying attention, even though I spent hours planning this lesson, making it as engaging as possible.  So there shouldn't be a reason why you're slumped on your desk.  And now the whole class will suffer!  Mwu-ha-ha-ha!   I can now empathize with teachers who used to bother me before.  When I was a kid, I would think,  Who cares about how we're sitting?  Just teach me something already.   Bad posture irks me.  When I look out into the classroom and students are slumped over their desks, doodling or nodding off, then I get frustrated.  Of course, students wouldn't be nodding off or doodling if my lessons were more  interesting .  Touche, inner-voice.  Tomorrow, I will have a better lesson.  We're going to be working on writing persuasive letters.  So they understand what it means to persuade--or, as Ruthie said,  talk someone into doing what you want --I'm going to pair students.  I'm going to give each pair a scenario.  For example, "Persuade them to do the Macarena."  With their partners, they're going to come up with arguments for why another pair should do the Macarena.  They'll have four minutes to come up with three reasons why the other pair should do the Macarena.  Then each pair will get to try and  persuade  the other pair to do whatever is in the scenario.  After that, we'll work on writing persuasive letters.  (I'll already have modeled the process.)  So they're writing persuasive to try and convince me to let them have some party time on Friday.  I think that will be fun.

       I thought it might be fun to include the lesson I will be teaching tomorrow.  Lesson plans follow a very specific format.  For anyone who hasn't taught, or is still in school, you might be surprised at how in-depth the planning can get.  And this is one my shorter lessons!   Ms. Polk Writing lesson Monday, 7-12   OBJECTIVE.   What will your students will be able to do by the end of class?  SWBAT explain different motivations for writing letters (i.e. persuasive vs. narrative). 	  OPENING.   How will you focus, prepare and engage students for the lesson’s objective?   I’m going to experiment with discovery learning.  (I’ve been told that Institute is the time to experiment with different instructional strategies, so here it goes!)  I will give students directions, both spoken and written.  I will tell them: “In a moment, I’m going to put you into groups of three, then tell you where to sit.  You will need to bring a pencil with you—that’s all!”  I group students, then say: “Stand up. Now what are you supposed to take with you?  That’s right, your pencil.  Now move to your new table.”  (I’m also experimenting with breaking down directions into smaller parts.)  Once they’re there, I will say: “Good.  Now we’re ready to start learning about how we write letters.  Today is going to look a little different than other days.  I’m going to give each group three letters.  First, read the letters aloud.  Then try to figure out the differences between the letters.”  Then I will pass out the letters and tell them to begin.  I will have two letters.  Right now, I’m thinking about having one letter in which a child writes to Santa, arguing why he should put her on the “Nice List.”  And I could have a letter in which Spiderman writes to Mary Jane, narrating his thoughts.Kids will have 10 to 15 minutes to read the letters and write down the differences between them.  During this time, I will circle around the room to help guide students to their discoveries.   INTRODUCTION OF NEW MATERIAL.    How will you convey the knowledge and/or skills of the lesson? What will your students be doing to process this information?    	 When they are finished, we will move on to talking about our discoveries.  I will ask each group to share one of their insights.  Again, I will ask prompting questions so we can get to the nitty-gritty of today’s material.  Some of the questions I might ask, in particular order, are:  How does Spiderman greet Mary Jane?   Is that greeting different from the greeting the little girl gives to Santa? Does Spiderman’s thoughts follow an order? Does the little girl’s letter follow an order? What clue words make you think she has an order? Why is Spiderman writing to Mary Jane? Why is the little girl writing to Santa? How are their reasons different? Does Spiderman sound like he’s talking to a stranger or a friend?   What words make you think he’s writing to a friend? Does the little girl sound like she’s talking to a friend or someone she has never met before?   What clue words make you think she’s writing to someone she has never personally met?  We will end up talking about persuasive and narrative writing.  First, I will define the types of writing, using a T-chart to highlight their differences.  I will use students’ observations to expound on these modes of writing; their insights will be added to the T-chart as examples.	  I will provide three questions to help students discern between both categories of writing.  Then, I will model reading one letter on chart paper and determining its type of writing.  	  GUIDED PRACTICE.   In what ways will your learners attempt to explain or do what you have outlined? How will you monitor and coach their performance?   	  In groups, students will read a short letter together and determine the category it falls under.  I will have two posters with “narrative” or “persuasive” written on them.  When they’ve finished group work, they will go stand under whichever sign they believe matches the category of the letter.  We will talk about and debate their choices.I’m going to have a letter to Donkey from Shrek, in which Shrek tries to persuade him to take a two-week vacation in the land of Far, Far Away.  This will be a little more difficult for students, because Shrek and Donkey know each other, but Shrek is trying to persuade Donkey to leave.  This letter is going to be a little trickier, so that way we can have a good debate over what type of letter it is.	   INDEPENDENT PRACTICE.    In what ways will your different learners attempt the objective on their own? How will you gauge mastery?   	 Students will make a foldable in which they explain the different ways of writing and why someone would choose each mode.	   CLOSING.   How will you have students summarize what they’ve learned? How will reinforce the objective’s importance and its link to past and future learning? 	  I’ll ask them what they’ve learned.  I’ll take that time to clarify anything they’re still confused about, then preview the next afternoon’s lesson: They will be learning to write a persuasive letter—to Mr. Northern, Ms. McDonald, and me!

       I hope that I rediscover poetry--or writing of any kind.  I think the time in graduate school just confused things in my head.  A crisis of writing is a crisis of faith for me.  But I've squared away my religious beliefs, and I'm walking down that path.  My writing?  I don't know.  I feel like I'm a better teacher than writer.  Is this true?  Or is it easy?   _______________________________________________________   People here at Teach For America are always sharing their inspirational stories with us.  You can't walk through the cafeteria without someone telling you about how Deshaun wore shoes three sizes too big, or how Dwight finally learned how to recognize "er" endings.  It's funny, but the stories are generally about boys too.  Boys who acted up, but once the teacher got them alone, turned out to be intelligent, thoughtful students.  I haven't  once  heard an inspiring story about a troubled girl since I've been here.  Not from the administration, at least.  Not from anyone who isn't a first-year teacher.  The troubled boy is romanticized.  He acts up in class.  You're grateful when he's absent.  But then you decide to offer him tutoring after school and during lunch.  And you discover common interests.  His family fascinates you.  You never realized the depth.  And when it's time for him to graduate--or he moves away--your heart breaks.  Because he's a boy you've invested your time into for months.  And he's supposed to grow up and become  great .  But what about the girls?  The quiet ones.  You assume they know what's going on.  They're so polite.  They nod when you talk.  They smile and sometimes hug you.  They're eager to tell you their stories, and you listen with when there's time.  And they're so happy.  So happy with any little attention you give them.  And then you give them a test.  Or you call on them to read aloud.  And you realize,  My God!  They're so far behind.  I didn't know.   But you're already spending your lunchtime and after school hours with that troubled boy.  And the girls are so happy.  So polite--they smile and nod their heads.

       I don't know anything about Arkansas.  But I'm going to be teaching there, in Marianna, a town with app. 5,500 people in it.  There was a letter waiting for me in my mailbox.  I will be teaching at Ann Strong Middle School.  I will be teaching "Reading" for sixth graders.  I'm excited that I will be teaching Reading instead of Writing.  After two weeks here, I know that I'm better at teaching Reading.  It's natural, like curling up under blankets when it's cold.  I want to write my thoughts about my placement before I talk to anyone else.  To be honest, I'm a little disappointed that I won't be teaching in Mississippi.  Not because Arkansas is a bad place; I don't know anything about either state.  But Mississippi sounds more romantic, especially to an ole' Northerner like me.  Arkansas just sounds, I don't know, less intriguing.  Less Blues.  Less folk.  Less mysterious.  I hope I read this six months from now and laugh to myself.  I hope that Arkansas enchants me.   Arkansas.   I think the problem is its name.  I'll have to find out where the name came from sometime.  The story.  I  love  the town name Marianna. I'll just say I'm from Marianna, by the Mississippi.  Fifty miles from Memphis, which is actually a neat-looking town.  There's this one street in Memphis where people just walk around, playing jazz and blues and blue grass music.  There aren't any cars allowed on the street, even.  I guess I'll get to go to Graceland!  I'm nervous about Middle School.  Here, in Houston, I've been teaching elementary.  I'm a good elementary teacher.  Today, my Corps Member Adviser (CMA) told another CMA to go observe me, because I was one of the strongest teachers in her group.  Omigod.  I was so excited to learn she thought so well of me.  (We were doing a poetry slam today in my classroom.  The kids absolutely loved it, and the ESL kids took some risks.  I was so proud.)  So, I feel really good about being an elementary teacher.  I've been attending workshops in elementary teaching.  And BAM, I'm in middle school.  That's different.  That's 130 students.  That's the same lesson for the same class every day.  That's a long time to learn students' names.  That's less opportunity to be silly, because kids are  cool  at that age.  BUT, I've asked Baha'u'llah to put me where I'm most needed.  Where my talents, whatever they me be, will be of the most service to the community.  So I trust that I'm going somewhere special.  Special is an ambiguous word, but I don't know anything else to say.  I can't visualize Arkansas.  I don't know what it's going to be like.  But I think it will be special.  And I know that children, in whatever location, are children.  And I'm Ms. Polk, dammit!  (And the salary is decent, too.)
