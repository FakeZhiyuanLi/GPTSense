      Believe it or not this one will have no food references! I had an awsome day! Doing the modeling thing is not a bad deal. I met a lot of cool people today, did a lot of waiting, but had the best time while I waited. I got a bit red but oh well (due to the sun). The guy that is running the picnic (Ron), is the coolest guy ever. He is putting me on TV on sunday, and I am gonna be a sunshine boy next week!! How much does that kick ass!!! I never thought that I would have the chance to be a sunshine boy, or to be on TV, based souly on my appearance? I mean come on! In high school I was referd to as "female repelant." The fat goth with the long hair. AND NOW! Granted I have worked my ass off to be in the shape I am in, and let me tell you, it didnt come easy. But it seems that all of those grueling hours in the gym are gonna pay off (as if being healthy as an Ox was not payment enough). I LOVE NATURAL BODYBULDING!!! It blows me away what good nutrition and some iron can do, it is amazing. I can make my body (the only thing I REALLY own) look any way I want, and I love it! The face I cant help, but people dont seem to mind it, so I am thankful for that. Back to topic... my day kicked ass. I cant wait till sunday, apparently the women go nuts at these things, I love the screaming and all of that stuff, it is so fun! I dont mind the "being objectified" thing, it is all in the right frame of mind. This is a class act show, if it were porn, that would be different, and that is why I would never do that (aside from the whole moral thing... ick). Women are ok, it is guy who are the perverts. The girls have a lot more to be worried about than I do. The girls hoot and holar, and when it is done they go home and that is that. The guys do the same (except with less class) and then go find a quiet place... not cool! Well, I am happy anyways, I get to walk through a waterfall... A WATERFALL! I cant wait till sunday, it is going to rule!

      Guess what? I fucking hate paying for my Ex's shit!!! I have paid half of the phone, internet, cable and rent... for a place I am not even living in!!! We broke up, I still paid. Ok, that may be dumb, but I thought it the honerable thing to do, so I did it. But guess what? YOU MOVED AND DIDNT FUCKING PHONE ROGERS TO CHANGE THE CABLE SERVING AFTER I TOLD YOU ABOUT 4 TIMES TO DO IT! AND THEY HAVE MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER! I AM NOT PAYING FOR YOUR FUCKING TV AND MANY, MANY, MANY LONG DISTANCE PHONE CALLS ANYMORE!!! What does it mean when someone says: "Phone rogers and get them to transfer the cable to your new place, as opposed to starting a new account. I am just trying to save you the installation fee, which is about $100. But if you arent going to then tell me no that I can return the cable box." Obviously this means never mention it so that a reminder is neccisary, and then after 2 reminders dont do it. TAKE SOME FUCKING RESPONSIBILITY! I BET YOU GOT YOUR MOM TO SET UP YOUR PHONE! SHIT!! I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOO glad I dont have to put up with your incompetant shit anymore! Sometimes in life we have to do new things, have to phone new places... oh, lets order something on E bay and not tell Ryan even though it is in his name... AND THEN DONT PAY FOR IT AND MAKE HIM DO THE LEG WORK AND GET THE GUY HIS MONEY SO THAT YOUR SISTER (WHO I NEVER LIKED) CAN GET A FUCKING GAME!! I am so sick of paying for your shit!!!!! If you paid for this stuff yourself you would be broke!! Oh wait... I guess THAT is why you have no money these days!! I will be so happy when a phone call will be out of courtisy and not neccesity! FUCK!  (I feel better now)

      Ok, this one is a real venting about someone that I think is a real idiot. But I think takining this to another level, all men that do this are idiots. When a relationship ends, the girl breaks up with you, or whatever, you are allowed one, two tries at most for reconsiliation. In this one must be carefull. Because feelings are involved, one must walk on eggshells so to speak to avoid anger spikes, as these are very easily caused. But to put it plainly, as my Mother always says "It is better to attracts Bees with honey, than shit." And as usual, she is right. This brings me from the obscure to the specific. Shant or Shawn or whatever the fuck your name is, GET A CLUE! If you are trying to steal my girl, at least do it with better style than that you idiot! What did you expect? "I think you should come back home. You belong to me," "This is the last day. I wake up tomorrow single or your ONLY man. No more bs" Ok, anyone reading these would be under what impression. What is he saying here? He is saying: You screwed up (This is the last day), I am being nice and giving you one last chance (I wake up tommorow single or your ONLY man). And now my favorite... You belong to me? Who the fuck do you think you are! No one belongs to anyone else moron! I call Adele MY girlfriend, but that doesnt make her MY property! She is her own person, not some fucking subordinate! You don't seem to get that! But I guess that your lack of education, and obvious lack of integrity would account for this missunderstanding. You are an idiot and guess what... I AM BETTER THAN YOU FUCKER!! Anyone that would write what you wrote to such a sweet girl should be shot out of the stupidity cannon! Ok, people who are reading this have to undrstand. MY girlfriend, his ex, is a sweet, caring, loving girl who granted, does know how to swear like a trooper when she is upset, and granted has moods ever now and again. But when you really look at her, there is like 5% bad, 95% good, and she has the most gentle heart I have ever been able to find. I promise that she was a better person before she met you Shawn! You made her hard! You made her tough! AND IT WASN'T YOUR FUCKING JOB TO DO SO!! A boyfriend is suppose to encourage the opposite. This is what he wrote her: I fuckin hate you. FUCK YOU MOTHER FUCKER!" "Die." "Fuck you. Go with steroid freak. Bye" "Bye cunt. Life is beautiful without u. Enjoy the freak. Lol" "I just want you dead now, not soon" "Ive been using you this whole time. Im a good actor ;)" Now I would like to say that these are text messages, typed in word by word with the numbers on a cell phone... CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS! He apparently has nothing better to do than write these messaages to someone elses girlfriend... trying to use these tactics in getting her back. Oh and Shawn I have news for you: IT MR   NATURAL   CANADA! AS IN NO DRUGS OF ANY KIND! NOT EVEN THE PRECIOUS HASH THAT YOU SMOKE YOU RETARDED FUCK! I am 100% natural, not even ephederine to lean down, I use food, I plan my meals, I FUCKING SUFFER! And you attribute it to a chemical... FUCK YOU! I would love to bea the ever loving shit out of you, but because I have more class, I will restrain myself. Goto http://www.neutronsports.com/neutron/ryan.htm, and you will see me there, wining Mr NATURAL Canada, if you have any doubts as to my ass kicking abilities. I can fucking throw a car at you, you idiot, and I would love to do it! But you see... I also have money... SO I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE FUN TO SEW THE SHIT OUT OF YOU FOR ISSUING DEATH THREATS! WATCH WHAT YOU TYPE IN LEGAL DOCUMENTS, IE TEXT MESSAGES YOU MORON!!  I am going to end this, because this is a long blog, even for me. Shawn, I hope you read this, and I hope to have the honor of meeting you so that I can tell you face to face, what an Idiot you really are. You are the reason men have a bad name, so fuck off... and dissappear.

      I compete in 3 days now! I am excited, I am in the best shape of my life and I think I should do well. Though at this point it really doesnt matter, the excitement is in the fact that you have done the best you can, if I don't win it is because I  don't deserve to. I feel pretty confident none the less, these guys are gonna have to be in pretty good shape to beat me, but if they are, they deserve to right? I have had carbs now (rice cakes and instant mashed potatoes)so I don't have the burning desire to kill anymore ;-). I had a great night, with my great girl. I am so lucky to have her. Guys, I tell ya... you lost... I won! I am still drinking a fuckload of coffee though because my energy is not back 100% yet, but I am not grouchy anymore. I get to eat in 9 minutes, and I like that fact, then I get to eat 60min after that... I like that more. Rice cakes arent so bad after all you have had is fucking chicken for 4 days. I gfot this cool Starbucks coffee cup last night, and this new coffee. I havent had the new coffee yet because the old stuff isnt done yet. Regardless I am excited. I actually pulled the cup out of the dishwasher about 4 min ago so that I could use it for the coffee I am having now (I used it this morning also). The funny part is... I have like 3298752874 other cups I could have used, my Mom thought that I was batty! Well, as you can see I am in a better mood today,I will find it interesting to look back in a couple of weeks and see how my moods changed from day to day. Mabye then I will have an Idea of what the Ex was talking about... but who cares about that! That is why she is the Ex! I do my drug test on friday, that is always fun. I know they keep mine because I spend a lot of time both on the scan test and the interview bashing idots that take drugs... that will be the subject of a rant one day... because they are fucking dumb! (Please comment on this if you are a drugie so that I can email you personaly and tell you how stupid you are!) Well, time to get food, and more glorious coffee!!

      I never guessed that when I signed into Lavalife 2 months ago that I would have had such luck. I am sitting here today counting one month with a girl that is really amazing. I feel a bit foolish I must admit counting months, but it is less foolish than the weeks I was counting only one week ago. In any event, it has been one month. There have been a few things here and there that have crept up, but this is mainly due to me over analysing, which I am pretty bad for. She has supported me in my concerts, and now in my bodybuilding. One might read this and think "well... so what?" Let me tell you... it is a big deal. I am not the easiest guy to get along with sometimes, read a few of the things below and you will see what I mean. She hasnt had it easy these past two weeks, my being paranoid, my being over analitical, the poor girl hasnt had a break... but I did give her ample warning I must admit, I prepared her for a monster. I dont think I have been a monster, but I have been pretty close. It is hard for me when I am starving all of the time, and in so very much pain... all of the time, to think of others as much as I should. It seems like I try and make the world revolve around me every time I have a show. I am not saying this is a good thing! Quite the contrary! This is something I work at every time I have a show, and believe it or not, I have gotten considerably better. Though it does scare me that I could loose this amazing girl sometimes, and that is why I was so hesitant in the beginning, and tried to prepare her for the worst. Sweety, I told you it would be hard... this is what I was talking about, and I appologized in advance and I appologize now. I love this girl a lot, and assure you that any guy would do the same if he had any form of a brain at all. She is sweet, compassionate... I'll tell you what will make it easier to describe her... she is perfect. Sure she has moods, and she dwindles on things sometimes, but I didnt say that she wasnt human... I mean shit! Put up with me for a day and she will seem like a godess! Back to the point. Lavalife introduced me to a girl that I am fucking nuts over, and one month later I sit here just as nuts, and more in love. I am the luckiest guy in the world, and defy any of you to prove me wrong.

      Well, to all of you Atkins folks, I wish you the best of luck with the rest of your life. I hope that you never have to lift anything heavy... ever! I have no strenght, I am moody, starving, and I cant think straight... yeah, no carbs is the way to go! I only have one more day, then it is constant carbs for 4 glorious days, though the source is not exciting. Instant mashed potatoes made with water, and rice cakes. I may throw corn flakes into the mix, but I am not sure. Under no other cercumstances would I eat this shit, I would much prefer my normal 3,000 pounds of salad. I have been responsible for the death of so many chickens in the past 3 days. Eggs and breasts in quantities that no human should ever eat. This time around though I had some salmon and shrimp. This was nice as I havent done this before. I had this great salmon steak last night, it wasnt that big, but it was such a welcome change. This morning I flipped out on my sister in a way that I hope never happens again. Honestly I can say that I have only been that mad 3 times in my life before (They are all topped by when that asshole fucked my composition interview). She really didnt deserve it (that much of it anyways, or to that intensity), but she lied about something, and I fucking hate it when people lie to me. I don't lie. It is that simple, if I say something it is true. Why do people lie!? I don't get it! "Lisa, did you use my leg shaving razor?" I asked this because I was hacking the fuck out of my legs 5 days before I have to be on a stage in my underwear. "No" she responds. So I said ok and preceeded to goto get a new blade... there should be 3... I find 0. So now I have only one blade which is dull as fuck. My Mom would never dream of using my stuff and Lisa has lied about it before... all signs point to Lisa. Well I lost it! I said "I had 5 blades and I have used 2 and now there are 0, how does that work?" She said "well I borrowed 2." Here is were I have the problem, borrow implies that there is the intent and the possiblity of a return. What you were going t give them back when they were dull and gross?! 2nd issue, YOU SAID YOU HADNT USED MY RAZOR!! I WOULD CALL TAKING TWO, ONE OF WHICH BEING THE LAST ONE... USING MY FUCKING RAZORS!!! But I guess she though I asked her if she had used them... today, because she explained herself by rewording my question in a way that her partial truth made sense. FUCK PARTIAL TRUTH! I WANT THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE THRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH YOU FUCKING RETARD!!! I dont get it!! FUCK!!! Well, after ripping her in half and including looks that scared both her and my Mom, I was done. This bloging thing really works, I do feel better, I get why you do this sweety. Anyways, I am going to get myself another diet pop, as I have only had 3 in the past 15 minutes....

      Ok, so my layout sucks.... I will change it eventually, but for now it serves my purpose. I am not thinking clearly right now, so this should make no sense at all. If by some chance it does, I assure you it was accidental. First off. I suck at spelling, and long nails on one hand make things very hard to type. If anyone says that I am a fag for having long nails, I have one question for you... did you win Mr Canada for bodybuilding... probably not, so fuck off! Ok, carb depleting is not fun... you have to go out for fathers day and watch everyone eat cool stuff while your choices are so limited it makes you sick. "Come on back and have some apple crumble. Can't you have a bit of Ceaser salad?" NO I FUCKING CAN'T!!! I CAN'T EAT THAT STUFF RIGHT NOW, I CAN'T DO THOSE THINGS, A LITTLE WILL WILL WILL WILL HURT! WHY DON'T YOU GET IT AND STOP ASKING ME DUMB QUESTIONS TO WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER!!! FUCK!!!! Ok, I feel better. This thing where people say "Can't you have a little." or "A little won't do anything" or something to that effect piss me off. Unfortunatly my mother is the queen of these sentances!!! I love her to death, but when she asks me stuff like that, or she makes me food and says that "there is just a little spice" or something like that it drives me batty. Let me inform you all of something, only the expression "a little" exists in the Italian vocab, the actual concept does not. So in closing, I want cake, or ice cream, or fucking anything that isnt protein! BUT NO! Well, I will have it in 6 days... hehehe.

      I figured I would start my ranting by picking on myself and others in my field. Very smart people(not neccisarily me here) can be turned into real idiots when they deal with pre-bodybuilding competition dieting. I consider myself to be pretty smart, but when I diet for a show, you have never met a more stupid person in your life. When I was on a trip with a friend of mine, she asked "did you put the remote control in the turkey?" (she meant in the container of turkey) and as I said no I found myself looking at my hand in the container of turkey, fumbling for the controller. THAT IS DUMB! This stuff happens all the time! I cant think of a night that I have been teaching and not dropped the fucking pencil 2093402457023 times! Ad then comes the fun paranoia. This part is were you think everyone is against you, or mad at you, and the entire world revolves around you... FUCK OFF! I am saying this presently going through it. Just because they are my own actions, does not mean I cant hate them aswell. I just recently broke out of a five year relationship, and a huge part of the breakup was my moods before a show. It is needless to say that this makes me a little paranoid seeing as I compete in 9 days and I have a new girlfriend. How she is dealing with my I have no clue, I would have left me a while ago. But she is awesome. She deals with my stupidity well (I think) and that is saying something. Well, this went in a direction that I did not plan for. Long story short. A smart person eats when they are hungry. Bodybuilders do not. Hence bodybuilders are dumb.... I guess... well, mabye it is just me.... who gives a fuck.
