       Hey everyone! How's it going? *sigh* Its going okay here. Just kinda down about a few things. I took my dad's computer, formatted it and reinstalled Windows on it. It was about time. But *shrugs* that's not such a big deal. I guess I'm just falling into a stage where I'm feeling lonely again.and in a way, spiritually dry. I need my own little revival. I guess I'll get it when I on that Ormond Trip. When I get like this, I'm just crying on the inside and I want nothing more than for Jesus to come back right then and take me to Heaven, because I'm growing tired of the world and all its false pretenses, its false teachings and most of all its apparent intolerance of Christianity. I say that because now it seems I'm getting attacked left and right because of my faith. No, I didn't expect it not to happen, but even though I try not to let it bother me, it can be depressing.  I missed church again... I don't remember the last time I went... and I'm getting sick of not going. I guess in a way its my own fault, I shouldn't rely on my parents to get everyone up and go, its about time I did some things for myself anyways.  *sighs* Well I'm going to go, thanks for reading. As always, God bless and keep you all. Byebye.

       had a great day today! got a lot of ppl to sign my yrbook, got 3 phone #'s from some gals who want me to call them and get together this summer, muhaha ;) great stuff. took a test in 1st block, got out of it for a few minutes for an assembly about senior pictures. (*makes mental note to show that flier to parents*) got to sit with adam s., josh, peter, russ and jacob, don't normally get to talk to all them. the best part about today?  I PASSED ALL MY GRADUATION TESTS AND PASSED WITH DISTINCTION ON 2 OUT OF 4!!!  *phew* i was worried that maybe i hadn't done well on them, but i was proved wrong. talayna was so happy, we both did really well, she sat beside me and we talked and she was literally bouncing in her chair. (she was one of the gals who left their #'s ;)) i feel sorry for those seniors who didn't pass some of their tests, they don't get to graduate :(. we have to take them as juniors, in case we fail one, so we take them again as seniors. as long as i pass all my classes next year - which i will of course - i'm set to go for graduation!  anyways, the rest of the day pretty much rocked, 'cept for makin a 50 on a test! oops! lol well i'll post again later, but i gtg catch my friend and some ppl from his youth group on the radio. (95.3 - The Hook baby yeah!)  lata! God bless!

       *sighs* what do you do if you've been in love with someone for so long... and you've thought you were over her but then in one moment, all your defenses are blown away and you realize... she still has your heart?

        hey everyone. today wasn't too bad of a day, as of tomorrow we'll have 6 days left in this school year! i can hardly wait. 1st block went without incident, mr. dale made us work work work as usual. didn't let us finish watching that movie on the 60s/Vietnam that we were watching, but what else is new, he does that. 2nd block, my teacher took up or books and made plans for a pizza party tomorrow because tomorrow is the seniors' last day. i realized i needed my book to finish some make up work on the way home today! oops! oh well, i'll do it in class. 3rd block, had a test, passed it, watched Forrest Gump, hehe.  so yeah, i've still got to get a few people to sign my y*book, i meant to get Jessica to sign it, and i walked right past her when school was over, she was waitin in the lobby, we even exchanged smiles and "hey"s. i even had my y*book in my hand! *sighs* oh well, i'll get her tomorrow. gotta get Kayte, Josh, Kaki, Melinda... i'm sure there are others, just can't think of them right now.   well tonight is the series finale of Fraiser, i'm sorely going to miss that show. i hope it won't be as sad as the Friends finale.  last night i went to JE at church, it felt good to have the whole band back again this week, and to sing and worship with my friends. i sat with josh, his bro matthew, my bro jake and brad. tyler sat next to me, haven't talked to him in a while, rachel sat beside him and tank sat next to her. amy, matthew and christy came in late as usual, lol. she didn't get to sit with me though, she asked me if i went to take my driver's test, i told her no, so i'll go sometime soon to take it. and afterwards we all went out to this vacant lot behind the church and to celebrate the coming of our new youth intern we played baseball with a few food items lol. he would throw something and you had to hit it with the bat, the funniest one was the coconut, people riding by must have thought we were crazy, it was great fun, though.  jayme and matt are no longer talking, and she felt that because they weren't talking that meant, because i'm his best friend, we can't talk anymore either. so that really sucked, and i protested, but it didn't help. chelsea is her best friend, and my ex. even though we are still talking, were from very different backgrounds and we've got strong personalities, so they tend to clash and we tend to get into heated debates alot, in fact, i just got out of one with her and i dunno if she's speaking to me at the moment.  anyways, i gtg. lata! God bless!
