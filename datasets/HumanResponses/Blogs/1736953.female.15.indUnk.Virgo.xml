       hey everyone...it's pretty late...or early--whichever way you want to look @ it...emily, jessica and amy are in the living room talking about spanish and their names... anyway...tim asked me today what the craziest thing i've ever done was...and by me trying to remember that, we all got into a giant convo about the stupid crap we did..we were f*cking NUTS...so emily goes "i dont' even think there are NAMES for what we did" it was really funny...we were sooo violent, if we got mad, we destroyed things...it was crazy haha---so now my tummy hurts from laughing SOOO much, and i need sleep but i don't wanna go to bed---and i have to be @ the school @ 3:30 to sing the national anthem @ 4 for the science fair!! YES! COOL STUFF...haha---and i dunno, i might stick around for a while and chill w/tim, but who knows...i'm really tired...but i'm starting to get to the point that i'm sooo tired, i'm hyper...so that should be fun...ahaha---well, i might come and blog some more later---bye~!

       got back from rehearsal about an hour ago...we were supposed to do a full run...but we got up to sequence 10 (out of 30) and we skipped sequence 9...how productive. and the pit orchestra was like, 10 people. but i think there will be more...at least i hope so. i'm not sure if we picked the Gavroche yet...but we @ least know that it's one of 2 people...so now they have to learn their lines and blocking and stuff...so that should be interesting.  it was cool having all of the little kids around, they're sooo adorable! hehe...well i'm gonna go...bye

       well, 2 posts in one day...amazing---haha. i'm sitting here being pretty pissed off b/c i signed on AIM and put an away message on while my sister was on AOL and she decided to stay on for, like, 2 more hours...so when i got back, nick had IMed me saying that he would've asked me to do something tonight, but now it was too late...stupid amy, i could've been out instead of sitting here writing in this damn blog well, today's rehearsal was pretty interesting...i got to scream @ the top of my lungs a few times, push joefi a lot (i also got pushed), and mark gets to hold me while i "struggle" and kick in the air and stuff---i like scenes like that, they're a lot of fun...i mean, my arms  WERE  bright red from being held, but that's ok... well...i think i'm done here...i'll add more if i think of anything

       ...i'm in gym right now--in the computer lab....retarded?? yeah...we're looking up muscles or something, i dunno, it's stupid. anyway, now that i'm done, i'm really bored and have nothing better to do than write in this thing, plus, i only had about 5 min on last night, so it was a lil rushed. so anyway, yesterday, i ordered my class ring! i'm soooo excited. on one side it has my name (maryliz to be more exact) and a "drama" thing and on the other side is 2006 and a volleyball. it's white gold and it'll have a sapphire stone (being that my b-day's in sept. and that's by birth stone.) so far, today has sucked...b/c i got home so late yesterday, i forgot to do my math homework, so i set my alarm, l ike, 20 min early so i could get it done before i left. but when it went off...i pushed snooze (or i thought i did) thinking it would go off again in, like 5 min and went back to sleep. the next thing i knew my mom was in my room screaming @ me and i had about 10 min to get ready...it sucked...and i was massively tired.  but then i still had to do my hw, so i was on the bus trying to finish it (actually, start  it, too)...so it's all bumpy and messed up and my '14' looked more like a blob haha. oh, and also, i have a take-home test for math that i forgot about (at least it's take-home) and i think i may have a test in chem, but i'm not really sure. oh, and all i can say is thank god for jenna, b/c if she didn't remind me that we were coming to the comp lab for gym, i would've gotten changed and that would've been annoying. and now i'm starting to feel sick...and billy got sick the other day and andrew was starting to feel sick, so there's a very good chance of me catching what they have. well, enough of me complaining, i'm gonna go...i hope the bell rings soon...bye!

Rapper's Delight, HELL YEAH (kudos joefi, adam, and christina) and i just LOVE City Called Heaven (yvana was amazing and my voice didn't crack--YAY!!!) i can't wait to hear those recordings....but on the other hand, the concert chorus SUCKED...we were ATROCIOUS...joyful joyful was funny b/c noone knew the "choreography" (if you can call it that)...so me and Carolyn just winged it...that was fun...hahaha. oh, and Only Time (which was the "small group") was pretty good, although i messed up a few times...   **BIG NEWS**  to the cast of Les Mis...WE HAVE A GAVROCHE!!!! YAY----no more pretending to see someone who's not actually there...oh, man, but all of these kids trying out were ADORABLE...and this one little girl who i think has the solo in the beggars was SOOOO good!!!  well, i'm gonna get some rest...another loooong day tomorrow (rehearsal til 9...again) luv ya all!!!

       well, just got back from another drama rehearsal...in case you didn't know, or couldn't tell, drama is my life...at least for these 3 months.  anyway, we got a little bit done today, 'cept i can't do the fricking song w/out hysterical laughing in J. Mac's face (sry john, i just can't help it...).  tomorrow we're doing yet another song w/me being hopelessly in love w/a guy who won't give me the time of day...woohoo!! AND i get to go straight from that rehearsal to the "dress" rehearsal for the Pop's Concert...and then i'll just be @ the school til about 9ish. so basically, my entire day tomorrow will be spent at the school...from 7:00 in the morning til 9...that's where i'll be...FUN!!! haha  oh, anyway, back to rehearsal...i spent the time upstage-right walking on when i was supposed to, then having mr. roth stop the music and start it all over so i had to walk back....i must've done it, like, 10 times....it gets annoying after a while.  well, enough of this crap...i'm gone---i'll be back, maybe P.S. I LUV DANIELLE (only she knows why...operation:secret has not yet been executed...but in time...)

       well everybody, here it is: my new blog. i wasn't going to have one, but i got bored today, and decided to open it. it'll probably be gay...but that's alright, it'll give me something to do.  anyway, these past few months have been somewhat eventful. first of all, the drama society has decided to do Les Miserables and i have the role of Eponine (who sings On My Own...which is awesome) so you guys better come see me and a bunch of other people (including danielle perrone, nick culver, nicole pagnotta, adam yudman, kevin rodriguez, joefi, and veronica and brian gonzalez---they're all of the other leads) in March. yeah, it's only, like, 3 or 4 weeks away...kinda scary.  what's even more scary----we had rehearsal last night and we were doing a song w/the chorus in it---you guys need to, you know, TRY!! you could be sooo great if you just had confidence in yourselves...in my opinion, it's better to sing the wrong notes strongly then the right ones weakly (that goes for you, too danielle...you NEVER have any confidence in yourself!! you're RIGHT!!!) anyway, Lee and I were discussing the fact that i'm singing louder than this 30 person chorus...so i've decided i'm gonna try and sing softer (b/c i'm not purposely trying to be loud...i just...am) but you guys gotta try to be louder...that's the deal...  also, i got drunk for the very first time the monday during our break...it was somewhat embarrassing, but i didn't puke or faint, so that's a good thing. but it has come to my attention that it's in a blog that i and danny shea were "hardcore making out"...that's just not true....yes, we were making out---but not hardcore. anyway, on the way home andrew kept telling me to just walk into my room and have him talk to mom...but i just talked to my mom instead----she doesn't know, or she does and she's just not saying anything, either way....i'm not in trouble, so it's all good. well, now that you've all been bored w/my crap stories, i'm going...i may or may not write sometime soon...we'll have to see....

       thank god we have off on Friday...i dunno what i'd do---it's only wed. and i'm already really tired--w/e though, i'll survive...  anyway...i haven't really been paying attention in too many of my classes...and i was supposed to read a book by mon. and i didn't even start it yet...whoops---but i don't really care, the stupid teacher's annoying anyway.  i definatly have nothing to talk about really...umm...yesterday i did nothing, and today i was gonna stay after to review for the global test i have tomorrow...but i'm too damn lazy---w/e, i'm sure i'll do fine anyway, i actually listen in that class......but the OC's on tonight! yay!! i missed last week's and i'm REALLY pissed off about it...but i had a drama rehearsal, so i don't mind too much...but i HAVE to see tonight's, b/c i'm addicted to that show...  well, i'm going to go...  P.S. to all of you who asked or are going to....yes, i have a boyfriend now, and yes, it's Tim...

       well...it's 10:56 on the monday after this last weekend of shows...i just woke up, like 10 minutes ago...i was going to go to school, but i could barely open my eyes this morning and i'm actually pretty sore from the giant game of ultimate frisbee that we played last night----anyway, i'll definatly be in school tomorrow and i think i'm just going to sit around all day, maybe read the book that i was supposed to read by today...who knows  well, these last 2 shows were AWESOME...i'm talking almost perfect....well, Saturday's WOULD have been perfect...but the fire alarm went off in the middle of Kevin's song so we wasted a few minutes outside---but we went back in and Kevin was even more angry and in character so it was EVEN better...during MY song i was, like, hysterical crying, it was scary, but it worked---and before and after the show...we were ALL a mess (and by all i mean the girls and a few select male, seniors)...but it was really bad, too much crying...by me, especially surprisingly, though...i didn't cry yesterday when we were destroying the sets...it was fun to beat the crap out of some of them...and i kept a few pieces (i have a step from thing i had to climb on, a stone from the wall, and a piece of the barricade)---it's pretty upsetting to know that it's all over...but i'm ok now---hopefully i'll get to do a theater program or something during the summer, b/c i dunno how i'm gonna go a year without being on stage----well, i'm gonna go...bye---~*mary elisabeth*~

WOOHOO!! it hasn't been on for, like, 3 weeks!! but that's ok, b/c i haven't really been home to watch it....it's the best show EVER, so i'd hate to miss it...i've only missed one episode so far....  yeah, well, before i go to rehearsal i'm going to a track meet...soooo, i'm gonna get in the shower before i go...bye

       well, today was completely unproductive...  i got up @ 5:45 so that i could be @ the school VERY early to get ready for the performance for some ppl (and they were RIDICULOUSLY rude and disrespectful)---so the whole thing was crap. then i didn't feel like going to english b/c i didn't do any of the hw or study for the vocab quiz. so me, tessa (who is in my english class), billy, tim, james, steve, mike, keira, etc. just hung out in the back of the auditorium, which was fun. 6th period was lunch so i just stayed there...danya and juli showed up. 7th i had global and i have a project due on monday and i needed to do research. 8th period was spanish and i told mrs. medina that i had a lesson and went and sat in the lighting booth with mike, eric, billy and christina... so, in total, i went to 1 class today...it was a pretty good day...but i'm REALLY tired now and my face is, like, burning b/c of all of the make-up that i had to wear and then wash off...  well, i'm going...

       well guys, last night was our OPENING NIGHT...and we did AWESOME!! i'm soooo excited, i mean, there were a few little mistakes, but they don't even make a difference, it was just soooo great and i wanna congratulate EVERYone!! and we have another show today @ 2:30...you might wanna come early b/c last night we sold out and we had to send ppl home (how fricking awesome is that???). i'm just soo psyched for tonight, the engery that we all had better be there today...and we'll only get better!! so you can imagine what it'll be like next weekend.  well, i know the audience was impressed w/last night's performance...but i REALLY hope that Mr. Roth was, because if he wasn't, then it was all for nothing. if mr. roth isn't happy w/anything, then it's not good...b/c mr. roth knows everything, lol.  well, i'm gonna go...

       i hate snow right now...this is sooo annoying, and i still didn't find out if i have rehearsal and when it is. and my fricking mom is being SOOO annoying about everything. she tells me the SAME shit over and over...and she expects me to base what i do on what other ppl will think. i'm sry, but unless you're, like, my BEST friend, i don't give a SHIT what you think, so sry, but i'm a bitch and i don't care what ppl think about me or the things that i do. i'm gonna d owhat i wanna do unless someone who i'm really close to me will get hurt. so all of you can deal with it  anyway, we had off today, and i'm really mad b/c now we have to go to school on a day that we should've had spring break...that pisses me off...but hopefully we can get into the school to rehearse...we'll see...last nights rehearsal was funny...i had to jump off like a 5 ft. ladder in order to get where i had to be in time...FUUNN..haha..it hurt a lil, lol, but it's alright, i'm fine...  well, i gotta take a shower... ~*maRy eLIsaBetH*~

       people piss me off....  anyway, we got out of school early today...THAT pisses me off, too...not that i like school, we just REALLY needed to rehearse today and now we can't so we have to add a rehearsal from 3-6 on thurs....i guess it's better that way...but still, i'm really worried, especially after my near-death experience last night, lol...mr. roth was sooo mad last night...it's a good thing we did 19 b/c that really lightened the situation...all the crazy shit that happened in that scene, lol (they're putting a ladder on the stage left wall now...by the way, lol) i think it gave everyone a good laugh, including mr. roth so he was in a better mood by lecture time, lol. we were supposed to get notes today..but NO, the fricking SNOW had to come and the stupid ppl in charge sent us home when it's not even messing up the roads...GRRR...  FUCK ALL OF YOU...everybody who's fucking "pissed" at me can go to fucking hell b/c i'm sure i didn't do anything wrong...b/c i don't even KNOW who the hell you are...i've just been told that "SOOO many ppl are pissed @ me right now"...SO FUCK YOU

       well, i got home from drama rehearsal about 20 min ago...it was...interesting. we got up to sequence 19, which is my song (but i'll give the details later in the blog). anyway, from what i'm told, the beginning was REALLY bad (but i didn't see---and i think it had to do with the pit, mostly, but i'm not sure). well, i'm not really sure, but i came in to do my stuff. and it was all going pretty well, i guess....kinda weird w/the sets and the lights b/c we're still all getting used to it, but fine. and then we had a 5 min. break and came back to do 19. well, all was going well and then it came time for me to climb the moving wall. on the right side, it was fine, but i didn't get there in time b/c it was too far. so mr. roth decides to let me try the stage left wall...the stage left wall doesn't have a ladder or braces or anything...so i go to climb this thing and i'm like, "how should i do it??" and the crew ppl are like "just jump" so i do. i grab the top of the wall and put my feet on one of the boards and then...CRACK...my life flashes before my eyes...it was SOOOO SCARY!! so now i'm trying to sing and nick is laughing and it's a big mess....to top it all off...the moving lights for On My Own were ReALLY weird...b/c it was the first time we were doing it...so they're going REALLY slow and then all of a sudden..ZIP, it moves SOOO fast i had to jump to stay in the light...laugh of the day well, g2g...be back to finish soon....

       well, the mall performance was good, i ended up singing On My Own, so that was exciting, but i hate performing in the mall, especially in front of J.C. Penny. the acoustics are GROSS and there's never a REAL audience...but the rehearsal this morning was good...we actually got stuff done...i didn't do much, but that's alright. i spent a little bit of time writing lil notes to put in the envelopes...but i still have a LOT more to do. but i guess it was fun to try and watch what's going on from backstage, and to talk to the crew ppl. i'm kinda upset that this whole thing is gonna be over soon...but i'm relieved...i'm FINALLY gonna have time to sleep!! i'm so tired right now, my fricking left eye is twitching...and hell week is coming up..DAMN!!! lol @ least i don't hate it, i love it...and i don't hate the ppl (most of them), but i'm gonna have NOTHING to do when it's done, i think i'm gonna be one of those ppl who end up staying after school everyday anyway...lol well...i'm gonna go

       hmmm...i'm still @ emily's and it's really early...i hate not being able to sleep, i'm SOOO tired and i can't get back to sleep, so i'm stuck here alone until emily and/or jessica wake up.  i really don't have much to say, but this is just a way of wasting time and pretending i have something to do when i really don't....hmmm...i think i'm gonna go downstairs and raid emily's fridge--brb well that sucked...her mom doesn't go shopping til sunday..so there was basically nothing in the fridge and then i moved on to their 'snack drawer' and i all could find were these Rugrats fruit snacks--YES...oh and a bottle of water..man, rugrats was a great show... anyway...i think i'm gonna go and try to find a game to play or something to keep me occupied...

       don't you just love when people you don't know (or care to know, for that matter) are talking behind your back?? i think it's sooo funny that i'm such a "bitch" to these people that i've never even spoken to, and some of them i've never heard of...it's ridiculous but anyway, i know i haven't written in a long time, that's because i haven't really been home. and when i was home i was sick or someone else was on the comp. i've just been doing a lot of drama related things. yesterday i was stuck @ the school til 9...so that was fun tonight is that senior-faculty game so i'm going to that...fun fun fun...tomorrow i have rehearsal, then i dunno what...and then on sunday we have a "preview' thing for the play, a few sequences (i'm in 2 that they're doing) and it's @ 1 (?) in front of JC Penny...that should be...interesting jesus...some people have been in pissy ass moods lately (me included)...it's crazy, i think it's all of the rain..it's making everyone PMS-y...w/e well, there's probably more that i wanted to say, but i don't remember right now..i might add a few things later, not sure....bye

       hello everybody...i stayed home from school today, slept til about 10, had a sandwich (and kept it down), went on the comp for a while, listened to some music, read a book, had a ramen (delicious and cheap!)... now i'm feeling a lot better, i just have a terrible headache and i just took advil, so lets hope it works soon. i'm pretty much just tired no rehearsal tonight, so i don't have to worry about doing anything tonight. i might do my homework that i was supposed to do last night, watch the OC...it's new tonight!! YAY~! i'll def be in school tomorrow b/c i can't really afford to miss the project thing we're doing in Global and i have rehearsal tomorrow night and i don't wanna miss that...b/c mr. roth said we're actually using the set and i need to figure out all the climbing stuff (james better let me climb that damn wall and sit up there or i just might scream, lol) well...i'm done here....

       i'm feeling a lil better...probably because i got up the courage to eat (only about half a piece of toast and some iced tea)...but now it's all in the sink, if you know what i mean... anyway...i'm not sure whether or not i'm coming to school tomorrow, it doesn't really matter b/c i don't have rehearsal until thurs...so i'll def be in school on thurs, b/c my mom probably won't let me go to rehearsal if i don't go to school  today during 8th period i picked out a NYSSMA solo...it's the one that Veronica sang last year (but she's amazingly awesome so there's no way i'll sound like her)...but anyway i sang through it w/ms. santillo just to see if i could actually hit all of the notes well...and i can...so i'm doing it---it'll be hard, though  hmm...well, i'm watching my brother and he's sooo cute...he pulled up his lil green chair so that he's sitting next to me and he's rocking back and forth to the music i have on (and when a song ends he says "yay" and claps--haha)well, now i just put him to bed..and he's not crying!! that's amazing..haha...  well, i kinda have a headache, i hope i'm better by tomorrow or @ least thurs. b/c i hate being sick...and i haven't thrown up in, like, 2 YEARS...until today...damn, i forgot how much it sucks...

       i feel like shit...i'm sooo hungry but i'm afraid that if i eat, i might throw up...it sucks. i got home from school @, like, 2:30 and then just layed down until now. being sick sucks, and i dunno if i'm going to school tomorrow, but we'll see. well, i'm going to junior prom (or the junior dance or w/e you wanna call it). tim asked me last night @ rehearsal and i said yes (obviously). i'm really excited but you can't really tell b/c i'm kinda tired... omg, last night @ rehearsal we started from sequence 19 and actually went til the end...then we did 20 and 23 again for the lil gavroches...it was kinda productive i guess. i got to sing "on my own" and i got sooo into it that  I  even cried and then i had to do my dieing scene...which was cool, i guess. i'm SOOO scared b/c we have 18 days til our first performance...i mean, i know all of my stuff pretty well, but i dunno it's still nerve-wracking. and we have a mall "performance" of some sequences on the 14th, i think it is, but i'm not really sure... well, i'm gonna go, maybe eat some soup or just go back to laying down...

       well, i actually didn't have rehearsal today, right after school--so i've been home since, like, 2:30...the baby is sick...well, he has some sort of rash so he and danny (my stepdad) were here, too. so anyway, i've been sitting here, eating the gigantic jawbreaker that emily gave me  for the past 2 hours. it started out white w/dots, then it turned just white, then orage, then white again, and now it's yellow...interesting..haha danielle..i'm not telling him yet b/c of "operation:secret"...after that happens (if it happens) i'll let him know..lol (my baby brother just brought a chair by the comp and is now sitting right next to me...soooo cute!!) OMG, I'M GOING TO DISNEY WORLD!! YAY!! me and emily are going w/her parents in may for her 16th b-day...i'm SOO excited...i found out a while ago but i forgot to put it in this thing...plus, it's not like you really care too much... alright...i'm officially TIRED of the fricking winter!! it was SUCH a nice day out...i hope it stays like that...it's just been sooo cold, that if it doesn't get nice soon i'm gonna scream...and i'm the one who loves snow  i have rehearsal tonight @ 6:30...it's full cast, so i think we're going to continue our "full run"...starting from sequence 10 and tryin to finish it...and if we use sets i gotta climb the walls a lot...so i gotta change b/c i'm wearing a skirt (**GASP**) and i'd rather not have to climb things and worry about what will be showing..lol well, i'm gonna go do some hw, maybe...and then go to rehearsal

       i'm having a very...split-personality...day. one minute i'm sooo happy i think i'm gonna explode, and the next, i'm soooo angry i think i'm going to explode. well, it's not like just out of nowhere, i'm happy then PISSED...there is a trigger, but i won't share it w/you...it could get me into trouble and i don't really need that right now.......grr...right now i'm in the i'm soooo mad i'm going to explode mood, can you guess why?? well, i'm not going to tell you anyway, so there's no point in guessing...most of you know anyway...but for those of you who don't...too bad  hmm...sooo, maybe i'll just sit her quietly and think about all of the GOOD things that are going to be happening and that have already happened...maybe i'll get in a better mood---no, i won't..the damn trigger just won't shut up... ok everybody...give me some advice---you have your sister telling you one thing and, naturally, you believe her...then you have this other person telling you the COMPLETE opposite...now, this other person has perfectly good reasons to be angry at you right now....who would YOU believe??? i honestly believe my sister...but maybe that's wrong...but i don't really care...i'm stubborn, so i'm not gonna lose this damn fight---too bad, so sad.  yeah...i'm going

       well...today was  *surprisingly*  a pretty good day! I wore a VERY short SKORT (a skirt w/shorts attached so when you bend over you're not completly exposed), and i straightened my hair last night. but i was wearing these black flip flops w/beads and now my feet hurt REALLY badly...eh, i'll live. well, anyway, like i was saying...the day went pretty well. i got to school and had all my hw done (YAY!! that doesn't happen to often anymore). 1st period was math...eh, it's math, nothing eventful...probability sucks, but i get it...so that's good. 2nd and 3rd...chemistry w/my  crazy  lab group. i seriously think they're one of the ONLY reasons i survive the entire day. 4th was chorus...we had a sub---on  NORMAL  sub-days i cut...but this sub was CRAZY---first of all, he was taking attendance in the beginning AND the end of the period. normally, i wouldn't care...but when he took attendance he made you raise your hand and he had to see you so that you couldn't just leave and have someone else say 'here' for you. second, he was SOOO annoying about passes....if you got a pass to the bathroom, no one else could go until you came back---so i wasn't gonna just leave and do that to everyone---and i was GOING to get a pass to the nurse, but TWO other fricking ppl did it before me...and 3 ppl going to the nurse in one period is a LITTLE suspicious. omg, AND he watched us like a hawk---we weren't allowed to even walk around the damn auditorium...stupid substitute...i hate him...grrr next was 5th period, but before i get there...on the way to 5th i might have gotten myself a date to senior prom!!----i'm still not positive as to whether or not it was serious...but we'll see! well, 5th period was fine, even though it was english....we're watching a movie (that's actually GOOD)...so i was fine 6th was lunch, 7th was global---i was late, got detention on Friday, w/e--it's my first detention, like, EVER, so i can deal w/that---8th was ALRIGHT---it was spanish and i never pay attention in that class but i did today, so i learned something!! YAY~! hahahaha then....i came home!! yay! i picked up the baby, talked to a few ppl and stuff like that---i think i'm gonna do my hw again tonight  ::GASP::  and then the OC IS ON TONIGHT!! YAY!! i LOOOVE that show!! it's my favorite EVER...hahaha well, i'm gonna get going...bye everybody

       today was ok, i guess---it felt pretty long, but we watched a movie in english and i think i actually did ok on the global quiz. there was a fire drill 8th period, too...it came right in the middle of one of my scribbles. that's all i do in spanish---i write quotes down, doodle all over the place and play games on my (Emily's) calculator. so the fire drill came at a perfect time---i was completely zoned out, so it was a nice thing to wake me up so i could pay attention for the last 15 minutes.  speaking of waking up...i had to swim this morning, so i wasn't as tired as i usually am. swimming wasn't THAT bad, i guess---we don't really do anything...she makes us swim a LITTLE and then we just have "free time"... what's really funny is that today everyone kept saying that they liked my hair...i was like, "umm...i swam this morning and had a chance to put gel in it"--in my personal opinion, my hair looked like crap today...but ok  yeah...anyway---i'm gonna go...bye

       well, being that it's 7:56 and Jill's Sweet 16 started @ 7, i obviously wasn't allowed to go. i'm really upset, but i'll deal---i mean, i didn't know THAT many people that were going and i wasn't in the mood to get into ANOTHER fight w/her...so i just left it alone. i'm really sorry to Jill b/c i told her i was going and then i just didn't show up--but i'll apologize for that on Monday and explain the situation.  Anyway, my mom is letting me sleepover a friends house and watch movies and stuff, so that should be fun...and if it's ok w/my mom i'm going to hang out w/emily tomorrow---so we'll see...the weekend SHOULD be pretty fun---i'm just not gonna let my mom being mad @ me mess it up...i'm so optimistic... you should all be proud---lol  yeah, well my mom and danny's food should be coming soon and after they eat i'm leaving---so i'm gonna go get ready---ttyl!!

       hey everyone...i had a REALLY good time last night!!! i mean, i had sooo much fun---but then i got in the car and after everyone was dropped off, my mom starts yelling @ me for NO reason at all! an awsome night ruined by my mother---god, i really hate her... people like to talk---it's sooo dumb, everyone just makes rumors and makes other people seem terrible...but it's really not true---i mean, rumors about me don't really bother me anymore...but it's just a fact---i don't really care what people think, but it's very immature to just start stuff that isn't true.  If you're not sure about something, ask me--i'm not gonna lie, don't just go telling other people something that isn't true...  i THINK i'm going to a Sweet 16 tonight, but i'm not sure---because my mom is being pissy and she might not be letting me go...gggrrrrrr  well...i'm gonna go...read a magazine, watch tv, i dunno...

       hey hey everyone! i'm having a pretty decent day. 2nd i was supposed to have a lesson w/ms. santillo, but i couldn't find her (i found out later she was absent) so i sat in the chute the whole period and did my math homework. 3rd...eh, nothing interesting. 4th was really funny. we had a sub for chorus so me, carolyn, alison and heather cut (i know, i know, it was a sub...but i can't cut when ms. santillo's there...she notices when i'm not there). so carolyn and alison just walked out after the guy called their names and then after he was done me and heather snuck out the side door (oh man, we're such rebels!! lol). 5th i had a test on part of macbeth..that really sucked. 6th, lunch. 7th, global...i have a really hard time keeping my eyes open during that class. 8th, spanish...she talked and asked questions the whole time, but i'm not really sure what they were about. after school i went to a math review thing b/c i really don't feel like failing the regents and then i came home. but then i went back to the school for volleyball, which wasn't that great b/c nissen wasn't there...and then i came home and took a shower...and now i'm waiting for my hair to dry so i can straighten it.  well there's my day...yeah...that's fun....bye   LESS THAN 3 DAYS UNTIL I GO TO DISNEY WORLD!!

       this morning right before math i realized that i did the wrong problems for homework and now i have to hand them in tomorrow and i'm getting points off...i'm really pissed b/c i actually  tried  to get that done on time. 2nd and 3rd were crazy chem periods...we took notes on organic chemistry the  entire time.  my hand hurt by the end of that. then was chorus...sucked as usual, but we sat the whole time, so that was good. then 5th period i took a quiz on part of A Tale of Two Cities...i have NO idea what that book's about...i've just been bullshitting the tests each time and i got 100 on one, so that's good. omg, and the funniest thing...mrs. mandel stands over me and goes,  "Grumpy?? i couldn't imagine..."  (i was wearing my Grumpy shirt today). i guess she thinks i'm sooo nice and sweet.... hahhahahahhahahahaha . she's never seen me around people that i  just don't like . let's just say i'm not fake @ all...if i don't like you, you know it! kevin put it best, "i have one thing to say...William" hahaha...inside thing. lunch and global...nothing interesting. in spanish mrs. medina gave us this whole speech about not wasting time and how we had so much to get done today...and then someone asked her a question.... there goes half the period , haha. all in all, today wasn't that bad. not good...but not bad either.   the inferno's  on tonight~! season finale, i can't wait!!!  GRRRR...i have  THREE mosquito bites ALREADY!!  i hate it...they're really red and they itch sooo badly...i love summer...but i hate the stupid bugs... they should die - ALL of them.

       sleptover jill's last night...it was cool b/c we weren't tired so we talked for a really long time. jill's the greatest. but before we went to jill's me, her and chris watched Vanilla Sky @ Chris's house. that movie is sooo fricking confusing and i was tired so it took a while for me to process anything...but it was good i guess. then we (me, chris and jill) we just laying in his bed watching tv which was alright, but i was completely the 3rd wheel. next time we all hang out we need to find something to do that doesn't involve me watching them cuddle a lot. but i still love jill...  now i'm w/emily @ her aunt's house b/c Phil's graduating tomorrow and they're having dinner and cake and stuff. then we're going back to my house to sleep b/c emily's parents have to leave early to go to the graduation.  6 DAYS UNTIL I GO TO DISNEY WORLD!!!! WOOHOO!!!  next friday i'll be on  my first plane ride EVER.  to go to disney world w/emily for her  Sweet 16! i can NOT wait....i've never been to disney world..this is gonna be awesome!!! yay!!!  haha...well, i'm gonna go...we're going to eat soon. bye!!

       wow...my computer's  fucking retarded ...it just went psycho on me and i had to restart it and i lost a whole entry that i was in the middle of writing, so now i have to start  all over .  so anyway, for going to bed @ like 9 last night, i was surprisingly tired today. i guess it's because of volleyball last night, but i dunno. my shoulders and neck are sooo sore right now b/c we (me, amanda, cathy, and her sis chrissy) stayed after and hit and then played 2 on 2 (me and amanda killed them..haha). but my hits were  awesome  yesterday. i was hitting so hard i thought that my hands would be  bruised  today, but it was awesome...... i really miss volleyball . it makes me sooo mad that i never get a chance to hit in games. 99% of all of my hits are in and most of those are in  awesome  spots. it sucks that i'm only  5'2".  i mean, i can jump really high, but it doesn't even matter when the blocker on the other side of the net is like 5'8" and can jump, too. that's why i don't hit...b/c if i tried, i'd get  completely shut down  and that sucks. so i'm basically stuck in the back row picking up what  our  blockers don't get. i love that, too...probably more than hitting...but it gets really  frustrating  when that's the only thing you do for an  entire season . well, i guess none of you have any idea what i'm talking about...so sry, i'll change the subject.  today was just normal...nothing interesting happened...but nothing interesting ever happens to me anyway...*sigh*, i'm  really goddamn boring .  i'm hoping to sleep over jill's tonight...i'll probably be able to b/c my mom never really says no...she'll just give me the cell phone so that she can call me whenever she wants. if i get lucky, today will be a day when she hardly ever calls (if she even does), but she could be in the mood to call every 5 minutes...so we'll see...she's having a bad day...so i dunno what she's gonna do.  well, i'm gonna get going.....bye

       stayed home today b/c i felt really sick this morning. so i slept til 11-ish and then sat around watching tv and movies and stuff. i'm feeling better, though...so i'm going to school tomorrow...plus, if i don't i can't do anything after school and i have touring choir and v-ball tomorrow after school and i don't wanna miss either of those. i missed the chorus concert tonight, but i don't really care...we suck, i hate it...ms. santillo has to go over some parts about 20 times before the damn ppl get it..it's ridiculous. it makes me very angry...how can ppl be that stupid?? why can't you just sing the damn notes and get it over with?? don't sit there and  COMPLAIN  that you have to sing... IT'S CHORUS ..WHY sign up if you don't want to sing?? ggggggrrrrrr...  ummmm.....yeah...i'm gonna go...

       more volleyball tonight!YAY! i'm really excited...again...and i'm really mad that i missed last thurday's b/c i had to go shopping w/my  uncle's mom's brother's granddaughters  (wow, that's a lot) who are from  Ireland . yeah...  well, i don't really have anything to share that happened today...but i was just thinking about something that i said about a year ago @ the mall w/emily. it's quite possibly the  dumbest  thing i've ever said...and i'm  hysterical laughing  everytime i think about it...so i guess i'll share:   emily:  well, can you hear this??....beep  me:  nope, not @ all  emily:  damn, well then you really do need to get your ears checked  me:  i've been told  100 ti  mes  to go get my ears checked, and everytime i go, they tell me i  don't need glasses !                     **SILENCE**(i'm thinking 'wait, what the FUCK did i just say??').....HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA   yeah guys...i actually said that...and meant it...i'm kinda ashamed...but i still get a good laugh @ it...if you don't think it's funny, i guess you just had to be there....yeah...  well, i'm gonna eat a hot pocket (philly cheese steak...mmmmmm) and then i'm gonna get ready to play some v-ball...WOOHOO!!!!

       ok, who's seen that  Quizno's Subs  commercial?? that shit is  fucking scary ...it was just on...and it freaks me out everytime i see it. why would that place think that people would want to go to a place that has  demented-rat-th  ings  on their commercial?? their eyes bug out, and their voices are creepy...if i ever see one of those places i'm just gonna go faster. i bet all the little kids that see those damn things get scared shitless....i mean, honestly... who the hell does that appeal to??   sry for that completely random outburst on that dumb commercial...i just really  despise it ...stupid scary rats...

       as you guys know, it rained last night so me, jill and chris had a change of plans. don't really wanna get into detail...but it was HILARIOUS and sooo much fun. i luv jill, haha. the craziest part is that my mom gave me her cell so that she could stay in touch w/me and she didn't call me  @ all  last night. anyway, we were at chris's for a while and then we were hungry so we went to Chili's and then we went back to jill's and me and jill  passed o  ut . we were just laying there and then she made the mistake of turning off the light and we were out..hahaha. i love sleeping over jill's b/c her mom makes a REAL breakfast every morning. today we had eggs and hashbrowns. yuuuuummmmm. then the phone rang and it was my mom freaking out b/c she tried calling me "sooo many times" and i didn't answer (the phone was upstairs and i couldn't hear it). so that was dumb...but when i got to the phone it turns out she only called be 3 times...she's crazy. then me and jill just layed around for a while...we were in a massively lazy mood and had no motivation @ all...we didn't know what to do or what we wanted to do...it was weird. we went to jen's for a little bit and we were offered a chance to smoke, but we didn't b/c my mom was coming soon and we weren't sure exactly when, and we're lucky we didn't and we just left b/c we were back @ jill's for about 5 minutes before my mom showed up (without calling...i knew that was gonna happen). got home...showered...came online. then andrew and xavier call me outside and andrew goes, "i heard you had sex with some black kid."  WTF is that???  first of all,  i'm a VIRGIN.  second, i don't know any "black kids" well enough to even hook up with. and third, right now i'm not hooking up or anything w/anybody...so that's a bunch of crap. this is, like, the 5th time andrew's questioned my virginity and it's really starting to piss me off...  gggrrrrr....yeah...now i'm going to eat dinner....bye

       ok, first of all...the "see" button on my keyboard won't work (i obviously had to sound it out bekause i kan't type it...see????) so...in it's plase i'll either be using an 's' (i.e. plase) or a 'k' (kan't)...so this'll look a lil weird. anyway...we voted for the offisers of drama today...Joe Pugs is Pres., Niki pags is VP, Kelly is publisity, Jen is sekretary and tim is treasurer...i'm happy w/all of them 'sept tim, i don't think i really want someone that i hate (and hates me) desiding the roles i get in the plays. but i guess i'll have to deal...it's only one year, right?? plus, the year after that i'm hoping to be an offiser...so that'll be good. my mom is piking TJ up from albany today...so i have to wat h the baby...AGAIN...big surprise. this suks, i'm always stuk @ home for this..gggggrrrrrr...and it's not even like i'm babysitting alone...so i kan't have anybody over...amy's gonna be here, too...and that's soooo stupid.  yeah...i'm bored...and i kan't do anything tonight...but i'm free tomorrow...let me know if you wanna do anything...

       it just got done pouring...the rain wasn't too bad just b/c it's warm out...it kinda feels like summer. it started raining right as me, jenny, joefi, adam, etc. were coming out of the school after our drama meeting. we had nominations for the officers today---i would've liked to get nominated for something...but i didn't wanna tell anyone, so i didn't. it's alright, though...tough competition...and there's always next year----anyway, the meeting went well..we're voting on friday, and we're going in june to see Les Mis...i'm very excited about that. lunch today was great!! not only did they have bagels, but jill was there!! yay!! that made my day great...  nothing big happened today....damn...i'm really boring...meh, i don't care...bye everyone  oh, i'd just like to add that i think the world thinks that i don't know how to spell my name...i'll write on all of the sheets and forms and stuff to sign up for things, etc. "Mary Elisabeth". and 99-fricking% of the time, the person turns around and spells it "mary elizabeth"...i mean, i know elisabeth is  supposed  to be spelled w/a 'z', but my mom's crazy and mine's w/an 's'. so next time you write my name (which probably will be never...but w/e)...remember, it's mary eli S abeth.  sry about all that...it's just something that's been bothering me for a while.

       right now i'm anxiously awaiting 6:00...'why?', you ask?...volleyball---YAY!!! me, kerri, cathy, catherine, jessica, and amanda (and maybe more) are all showing up @ Coach's little thing for them damn middle schoolers and playing for a while afterwards.  I CAN'T WAIT  .  i haven't played  real  volleyball in soooo long. i'm so completely out of shape it's ridiculous...i'm gonna be sooo sore tomorrow, but i don't care, it's definitely worth it. and coach is doing this every tues and thurs. for the next...i dunno, a long time. so now i have to go and pick my baby bro up from daycare...and when i get home, i'm getting my sneakers, spandex, and kneepads out...and getting ready. i'm soooo excited!!!

       i wasn't  too  tired today, which is surprising. i really don't understand why i'm always so tired...i get like 8 hours of sleep per night...maybe it's b/c recently they haven't had any bagels @ lunch so all i've been eating is pop-tarts and combos. yeah, that kinda makes sense. and today they  did have bagels...so i had my bagel w/cream cheese and sour cream and onion chips in the middle  (it's really good, don't knock it til you try it.) i've pretty much eaten it everyday @ lunch since...6th grade maybe.  mmmmmm ....it's so good.  wow, it was  so  nice out today. i had to walk down the street to get my bro from daycare and it was actually  hot . finally, i hope it stays like this for a while...i'm sick of the rain and the coldness.  oh man, my cousin just came with a present for Michael:  Elmo in Grouchland ...YES, yet another elmo video to be played  non-stop  in our house.  But @ least he's sitting quietly in front of the TV...that's always a plus...  well, i'm gonna get going...bye    You have a twisted soul!

You can act quite intelligent at one time, and grasp concepts easily, while other times they can find it difficult to understand. Twisted Souls are always very fun and Kind, and can be party animals.

       wow...tonight was...boring, lonely, etc.  i hate having to "watch" my baby brother @ night...alone. all i do is sit on the computer, listen to music and just make sure nothing happens to him.  and i always freak myself out when i'm alone in my house.  especially because of my dog, he's constantly making noise in the kitchen right by the back door and i always think it's something.  don't get me wrong, i'm not easily scared...but after i'm alone in my house for  5 fricking hours  and i'm  really fricking    tired ...things start getting to me.  but, hey, i got 99% of my homework done! (the part that i didn't do was read A Tale of Two Cities and that wasn't going to happen even if i had been alone the entire day)  you know what song i love?? "meaning" by Gavin DeGraw...i heart Gavin DeGraw..he's awesome. anyway, that song's really good...you should download it or something...but the best version is when it's just him and the piano...it's a lot sadder (is sadder a word??? let me know...eh, w/e..english definitely isn't my thing) yeah, well, this whole post was to occupy me for at least a little while...and i think this is as far as i'm gonna get.........yeah.......bye

       happy birthday darin!   well, today was 10 times better than it would have been if ms. mandel was in school. 1st period was math...we started statistics...fuuuun...nothing too interesting, though...2nd, chem test on acids and bases...think i did well, but there were a few questions i wasn't completely sure of, 3rd was chem lab and we just answered questions and did calculations. 4th chorus...wasn't  too  painful today. i had to do this stupid thing where you say the words of a stupid french song into a stupid tape recorder so that ms. santillo can make sure we're saying them right. i think it's pointless...if it sounds fine when we sing the damn song, who cares if each individual says it perfectly?? 5th, no ms. mandel!! YAY!!! we did some vocab for Macbeth and then sat around. 6th, lunch, i had to go to the nurse in the beginning of the period for my physical for v-ball. i'm 5' 2(and a quarter)". thats about...1/2 an inch more than i was in august...not too bad. lunch sucked b/c i didn't have any money...but alison and carolyn let me borrow some, so i ate a little bit. 7th was global. (CRAP! i just realized that i had touring choir rehearsal tonight and i didn't go....damn...oh well, i don't think we have anything too important coming up)...anyway, global was boring, and i have a lot of hw in that class. then was spanish...we were   supposed   to have a test today on food, vocab. but we got her to change it to...tuesday maybe??...so that's good. then we went into those stupid dialouge things that we didn't finish yesterday...my partner wasn't there so i got out of it...but we still didn't finish...we honestly do  absol  utely nothing  in that class.  anyway...now i'm home...watching Dumb & Dumber on tv...great movie. i might watch Friends later tonight...i think everyone is obligated to watch it b/c it's been on for so long and so many ppl love it...but i think i'll sleep tonight instead. it's never been a show that i've watched  religiously , so i'll just watch a rerun of it or something.  yeah well...i'm done with another boring entry...bye

        Happy Cinco de Mayo everbody!! (and happy Birthday Joefi)  i just got out of the shower, so i have time to blog while my hair is drying so that i can straighten it... today was ok, i guess...in gym we started the physical fittness test...so far we did the sit and reach (+11 baby!!) and the "curl-ups" (51). we'll probably do pull-ups and the shuttle run on friday and then start running - :*(  i'm definitely not looking forward to that. chorus sucked, as usual...and then english was just  painful!  we read more stuff about Shakespeare...and that's about it. ms. mandel is so fricking boring, i can't stand it. and don't you hate it when you ask somebody how much time is left in the period (thinking it'll be 10 min @ the most) and there's, like,  20 minutes  left?? it sucks...sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks... after english comes lunch...which was, once again, lonely. i have so much room now that jill's not there, i don't know what to do. i can't wait for her to come back...then i'll have a  **jill-hug**  overload. but that's better than not having any jill-hugs. skip to spanish...it actually wasn't that bad today b/c she decided to put us into pairs and make us make up a dialouge about stupid stuff. the whole process of just getting us into pairs took a while and then we took the rest of the period to make up the dialouges. so i lived through the day...it wasn't really a  good  day, but not horrible either. some ppl know why...some don't...but i really don't feel like explaining it b/c it'll just piss me off further. all i can say is, jessica, what did i tell you?? i  knew  that was gonna happen...  seas on finale of the OC tonight!!!!  i'm sooo excited (don't make fun of me for watching it unless you've watched it @ least once).  i can't wait...i might go to jessica's to watch it...but i'm not sure. i don't really care where i am when i watch it as long as it's  awesome  (and it will be). it's kinda sad that it's done until next season, but it's supposed to be amazing tonight, so i think i'll live.  anyway...i'm gonna get going...my hair's pretty much dry, so i'm gonna go straighten it...woohoo...that's fun----yeah.....bye

       i scrubbed out today...FINALLY, i haven't  truly  scrubbed out in a long time, so it felt good. recently my 'scrubbing out' has been pajama pants and a cute t-shirt or cute, but comfy pants and a sweatshirt. but today i had the pajama pants, the big sweatshirt, everything... even my hair was crappy , but i have to say that the bags under my eyes definitely  topped it off , lol. in my opinion, i looked like  shit  today...but i don't even care. i may have ppl that i want to impress, but that's ok...i'll straighten my hair for tomorrow to balance it out. plus...i had a great day. this girl (someone i know, but can't remember her name and i feel really bad) was like, "see?? you're even gorgeous when you scrub out"...so that made me feel  REALLY  good, not like i believe it...but still. she's  officially  my favorite person, haha. i actually  lived  through english b/c we read some stuff about Shakespeare (we're starting Macbeth soon). then 6th i had to make up a Spanish test...that was bad...i did terrible. i mean, i knew the stuff we were  SUPPOSED  to know for it, but mrs. medina makes up sentences to translate w/the words in them and i  never  remember the other words. plus, it was stupid farm and animal stuff and i  don't really pay attention when she's talking.  i have spanish 8th and she's SOOO boring, she just  talks and talks and talks  and it get boring after about  5 minutes . anyway, after i took the test i went to lunch, where it was pretty lonely again, but today we all  squished  to one side of the table, so it wasn't as bad as yesterday. and then sharkey complimented me. he said that he saw a pic of me @ the Junior Prom and said i looked * amazing* , so that helped the confidence thing, too. then was global...really boring...and then spanish. we spent the whole period going over ONE little thing b/c she  ALWAYS  gets off topic. someone will be like, "mrs. medina, how to you conjugate (insert verb here)??" and she's like, "well, (insert verb here) means ___ and it's conjugated like THIS because blah blah blah", and i take out some paper and start doodling and hope she doesn't call on me for anything. she's really not a BAD teacher...she's just boring, even i don't have the attention to listen to her...it's terrible. Mr. G was a  MUCH  better teacher, i looked forward to going to his class. but thank god i don't have to take spanish again next year. i still have to pass the regents, but that's not a problem...i'm a good test taker. well, after school today i had my first  detention EVER  for being late to Keeperman's class...w/e, wasn't too bad. i did my math hw and then played stupid games on my calculator. one of the women was such a  BITCH !!! i didn't have to deal w/her, though...so it's all good.  well. i'm gonna get going...this was a pretty long blog...i'm proud of myself...haha...bye....  p.s. i miss jill...i'm in dyer need of a jill-hug right now...if anybody would like to substitute until she comes back...let me know...

       i've gotta hand it to you, tim... you're pretty damn good @ lying . and your plan's pretty good, too. you're gonna give up on convincing  ME  that it wasn't you and then try to convince  everybody else ...that way, you've got ppl backing you when you try to convince me again. the thing is, whether or not you really are this  'sharkfiend' character  (and i'm still damn sure you are), you lied. you lied to me  or  my sister  or  everybody else you're trying to convince. so say you  DO  convince me that it wasn't you...so what??  you still lied , and i don't like liars...especially ones that piss me off on a regular basis. your story is still crap to me...you're trying too hard...wouldn't you be mad @  AMY  for telling me that you told her on the phone that it was you if it really wasn't?? but you're not mad @ amy, in fact,  you haven't even mentioned anything that would make her think you were mad @ her ...so something's wrong here. now, after this damn blog, i'm never going to speak to of this shit again, i think the ppl reading this are getting tired of it, and so am i.

       had my  last day of swimming  today...YAY! i'm so dumb, though. i wore my bathing suit to school and i forgot a bra, so i had to walk around in my bathing suit the  whole day ....eh, no big deal, alison seemed to like it, lol.  but on wednesday i start the  physical fitness  stuff...i'm definitely dreading that. i got  presidential  in the fall, but that was during v-ball season and i'm totally out of shape right now...it's gross.  i don't have a lot of hw...i just have to read part of A Tale of Two Cities by next week...the beginning of that book is SOOO boring...i got up to  page 17  and fell asleep. i hope it gets better...  today at lunch,  i really missed jill ...i had so much room, it made me sad. and now i don't have any  **Jill-hugs** . but i hope she's having fun. her and her mom are probably having a blast, and i'm happy for them...but i  can't wait  til she comes back...  this damn sharkfiend person ( a.k.a. tim ) is so dumb. if it was really somebody trying to screw tim over, why would they be writing me e-mails to try and fix it??  that's just fucking pointless.  and he keeps lying to a lot of ppl...he's gonna get himself in trouble like that...stupidass...  well...maybe tomorrow i'll have something  major  to share...probably not, b/c  when does anything interesting happen to me??  but still...it could happen...

       hehehe...mr.  "sharkfiend" , just give up...i'm  never  going to believe you. you've screwed yourself over  pretty damn well . no matter what you say to me... blood is a   lot thicker than water , and i'll always believe my sister before you. so why don't you just  get over it  and  move on ?? my backbone is  much  stronger than your's...believe me. so...good luck  trying  to convince me if you decide to keep trying...if not,  thanks for just leaving me alone , you were really starting to get annoying....

       yesterday and today were very uneventful.  yesterday i sat @ my house and Emily came over and we basically just watched tv and went on the computer. we were in my room by 10 and i was asleep by 11. it was  SOOOO fricking hot  in my room! i was sweating and i was in a pair of boxers that my mom gave me for v-day and a t-shirt. it was so bad. i woke up @ 5, 7, 7:30, 8, and 8:30. i couldn't get back to sleep @ 8:30 so i just got up and went into the living room and had a couple of krispy kreme doughnuts (they definitely beat Dunkin' Donuts' doughnuts)  today me and emily went to the mall w/her mom and she got a bunch of stuff for the summer and for our trip to  Disney World (as of today, there are 25 days left until we go...YAY!). then we ate @ Planet Wings...mmm, that was good, i had a philly cheesesteak. then we went to her house for, like, 10 minutes and i stole back some of my clothes from her closet. then i came home and changed and put clothes in the laundry and then i took a nap. and i just woke up, and nobody's home. i'm finally home alone...i have no idea where anybody is or when they're going to be home, so after i write this blog i'm gonna enjoy my loneliness.  i have my last day of gym swimming tomorrow. i hate swimming in gym, it's so pointless. the teacher makes us swim for like five minutes and then we have free time so we just sit around.  well, i'm not really looking forward to school tomorrow. should be fuuuun.    yeah, well, i'll be back later...  p.s. it's official, my mom really  IS  crazy. anybody who knows me well should know that. and if you're andrew's friend, you probably think she's cool,  but that's part of her craziness . andrew gets to do what he wants, and my mom  barely lets me leave the house ....psycho mom...

       i just wrote an entire entry and my comp restarted...so this one probably won't be as long.  me and jill got SO messed up last night...it was so much fun. (thanks joe) all i can say is thank GOD my mom let me sleep over...and she only let me b/c of Jill's mom (jill's mom is the shit, jill and her are gonna have a BLAST in Europe, i'm sooo jealous). i dunno what i'm going to do w/out jill. she's leaving for  2 weeks !! that means 2 weeks w/out  **jill hugs** ... :*( , and lunch is going to be LONELY. i dunno what to do whenever jill's not there. she better be able to get some time online so that she can a LEAST e-mail me. well, jill...when you come back, we better have more sleepovers.  i'm gonna miss you SOOO MUCH!!   anyway...michael had his surgery yesterday morning. he needed tubes in his ears b/c they kept filling up w/fluid and it was hard for him to hear (we used to have to, like, scream for him to hear us...now he hears me when i whisper). he also got some weird glands removed b/c they made his nose run  all the time . so the surgery went well, but he's still a little cranky...i hope he feels better.  oh, in case you guys couldn't tell from the change in the tone of my blogs, i'm in a much better mood. now that the weekend is here, i don't have to worry about seeing the person that gives me RAGE--jill says i was like the Incredible Hulk yesterday...kinda scary, but yeah...i was sooo angry...not anymore though...last night made it all better... i *heart* jill  well, i'm gonna get going---i'll be back later...maybe

       last night i slept over emily's...which was fine..but i had to leave @ 7:30 in the morning b/c she had to work and i had to babysit...it sucked...i was soooo tired, i passed out for an hour on the couch while i was watching michael  (thank GOD he was watching Elmo quietly...so he didn't destroy anything...or die...*phew*)  and i have to babysit AGAIN tomorrow...but this time i don't have to start until, like, 10...so i'll get a little bit more sleep.   i just saw Harry Potter ...i've been wanting to see this movie  FOREVER  and finally, i saw it...thanks Gong! me and gong went to the mall...bought the tickets, got something to eat and then we went to see it. it was awesome...i don't care that they didn't follow the book exactly...i read the book, what,  3 years ago??  i  barely  remember the book, so i didn't even realize the differences...except for a few of my favorite parts that were cut out. but i'll live...i can't wait for the 4th movie..i hope it comes out within the next year... anyway, after the movie, gong and i walked around for a while...went to Abercrombie and Fitch (which, normally neither of us would be caught DEAD in, but she had a gift certificate for $25, and she bought a shirt...boy, did that get her far...), Express, the Gap...then we went and got more food...haha---oh, and throughout this whole time gong was talking in a British accent, which i found quite amusing b/c lots of ppl were looking @ her funny. hehe... i *heart* Gong . so since we both enjoyed ourselves so much we made a date to do it again but next time we're going to see Shrek 2...can't wait!  well, hopefully i'll be able to get out of babysitting tomorrow...but i highly doubt it---but maybe i'll get lucky and i won't have to do it for THAT long...grrrr...i hate this little brother thing...he's adorable, but why can't he take care of himself??  and why am I always the one watching him???  grr..i hate being the oldest girl

       i never got a chance to post about the wedding or anything...b/c i was going to and then my mother got me all angry.  anyway...the wedding was beautiful, coach nissen... damnit.. MICHELLO  was beautiful. the songs were fine...during the first song (from this moment on) the groom cried...it was adorable, hehe....when she was saying her vows she cried and i had to turn away so i didn't cry b/c i had to sing in a few minutes.  in between the wedding and the reception me and adam drove around singing RENT which was fun...then we went to the reception and ate a little. then we went into the "main room" i guess and ate some more. then they played some music, which was funny b/c it was old music (like "it's raining men", "i will survive", etc.) so i was trying to dance to this music and it was funny b/c i'm dancing w/all of these 25-year-olds and we just couldn't dance...i guess you had to be there...haha. i had a lot of fun...but i was quite upset that Coach Dwyer wasn't there b/c he's hot...yeah... adam and i left @ 11:45-ish (which was right after dessert) and ppl were still dancing and stuff...i'm sure they had a LOT of fun after we left...haha   yesterday i woke up...chilled at my house for a while and then i called emily and left her a message b/c i wanted to hang out with her b/c i hadn't seen her in a while...so then she called me back and i went to her house and we hung out, talked about stuff (which was nice), played some games, listened to music, etc. just basically did the things that we used to do all the time. i really missed hanging out with her!! and now i'm back @ home b/c she's so busy lately w/work and everything and her and her family are going to a yankee game and then to see RENT (i'm very upset that i was left out...i've wanted to see that show FOREVER---:*(...)  so now i'm home today...but i think in a few hours i'm going to a graduation party....so that should be good. it's right up the street so i can walk so i'm sure my mom'll let me go...haha---she BETTER...hehe  well, i'll come back another day...or later or something--bye!

        my mother has reached a new level of insanity...i'm talking completely crazy.  so i'm @ emily's right now and i have been since about 4. so i call my mom around 7 or 8 maybe?? and i ask if i can sleepover...only i called from the cell phone, so my mom makes me call her from the house phone JUST to make sure that i was actually here. w/e...i can deal with that. well, everything was fine until about 10 minutes ago or less i'm talking to a few ppl and Amy IMs me asking me where i was...so i'm like, "i'm @ emily's, you knew that...are you spying for mom or something??" and she said, "no, i just forgot"...then all of a sudden she's like, "mom wants you to call her to make sure you're really there" and stuff like that...and i was basically like, "i'm online and i'm here and i'll call on the cell and have her talk to emily's mom if she wants" and then amy goes, "well, mom's gonna come and pick you up if you don't call from the house phone"...so i'm figuring it's my sis being an asshole just joking around trying to get me all pissed off and stuff so i say, "this has to be a joke, i don't believe you" and she says, "it's not a joke it's what mom's saying" eventually amy says, "mom says that this is just stalling so she's coming to emily's right now...she's got the keys in her hand" so i call her from the cell phone and my mom is like, "this doesn't prove anything to me...i'm coming to emily's and you better be there" so i'm basically just like, "WTF?? w/e, i'm getting offline and i'll call you from the house phone"...so i was stuck xing out everything that i had up, all the convos i was having were cut short and a few IMs got deleted and i call my mom and i say, "do you believe me NOW??" and she's like, "yes, but i don't want you online anymore tonight...the PERVERTS are on this late"...i was like,  "WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! i don't talk to ppl other than my FRIENDS...WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM??"  and she was like, "OH?? well who are you talking to?" so i wa slike, "BEFORE you made me get off i was talking to bryan, adam, gong, and amy..but NOT ANYMORE" and then she proceded to make me TELL her what was going on w/each of those ppl so i gave her short versions and things... i'm SOOO PISSED OFF THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN TRUST ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT I'M WHERE I SAY I AM----WHAT THE FUCKING SHIT?!?!?! I'M AT EMILY'S FOR CHRIST'S SAKES!!! WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE FOREVER...WHAT IS HER PROBLEM????? AAAAHHH...I'M SOOOO MAD  grr...i'm gonna go before i just ramble and get even MORE PISSED THE FUCK OFF....bye

       it's been a loooong day:   i woke up @ 8:30 , ate, got dressed, brushed my teeth and put in the music that i'm singing @ my coach's wedding.  by 9:45 , my coach came to pick me up to bring me to rehearse w/the pianist (hehe, i like that word) and we went to the church. we left the church @ 11:30-ish and it was about 12 by the time i got home, so i figured i'd try and call adam and  if i was lucky , he wasn't @ Bear Mountain for the drama picnic yet.  he wasn't , so he came and picked me up and we went there (we listened to  Rockapella and RENT  in the car...it was awesome). we got there and everyone was pretty much already there...i mingled and ate a hot dog and then a bunch of ppl went to play  Ultimate Frisbee ...i was going to, but me, melissa, keira and marsha decided to go visit Pat by the boats instead. Christina and Toni-ann joined us and we all just sat in the shade talking to pat for a while. "odell squared" decided to go on a paddle boat and then jenny and rob came down and went on one, too. me, marsha, keira and melissa went back to where everybody was and signed yearbooks and such and then toni, christina, rob and jenny came back and they were  soaking wet . you see...being jenny, she decided that since her and christina wanted to leave and toni and rob wanted to stay...christina and rob should switch places... bad idea . somewhere during the whole thing toni stood up or something and the boats tipped...obviously that was gonna happen...it just sucks that they were soaking wet for the rest of the day. me and gong tanned and chatted for a while on the big rock haha...and then we all basically left. when i got home i went online to try and figure out who i'm bringing to the wedding...and i finally did. then i had  one crazy conversation w/one crazy person  (you know who you are)...i won't go into any details..but that was  by far the most straightforward i've ever been w/a person and they've ever been w/me ...haha. i hopped in the shower and then threw my hair up and quickly got changed b/c it was already 5:15 and i needed to leave by 5:30 in order to make the wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner. got there...did my thing...haha---it was kinda weird being the only 15 year old among ppl all over 21...but i made a few friends (and some ppl offered to sneak me some alcohol--;)--i'll wait til tomorrow to take them up on that, though). now it's 11:32 and i got home about 20 minutes ago...and i'm getting ready to go to bed...tomorrow's the wedding, i have to be @ the church @ 3:30 for some more rehearsal and then i'm going to the reception and stuff...it should be fun...lol.  well, i'm exhausted and my mom is yelling @ me to go to bed...so i'm gonna go---can't wait for another busy day tomorrow

       this post is gonna be pretty much pointless...but i just wanted to comment on something  last night @ emily's w/the girls (that i haven't seen in a WHILE) em's mom was like, "one of the olsen twins are in rehab for an eating disorder" but she couldn't remember which one.  but, being me, i figured it HAD to be Mary-Kate ...when they were little she was never the beautiful one that all the guys liked in all of the movies...she was the  tomboy that the guys were never "more-than-friends" with.  so basically her whole childhood she was  never quite as good/pretty  as her sister, Ashley. anyway, i'm watching MTV this morning and,  low and behold , it's Mary-Kate who's in rehab for her eating disorder....man, i'm good...lol  well...that was useless...BUT, i am going in about 20 min. to my  LAST TEST OF SOPHMORE YEAR!!!  i'm sooo excited..and it's chem and i'm good @  chem so it's gonna be nothing. **sigh**... i can almost taste summer vacation ...

       i have a hard time sleeping after a night of "fun" or whatever...when i'm @ jill's, i sleep fine, but we only sleep til, like 7...but @ my house it takes me  FOREVER  to get to sleep and then i wake up early (especially when  amy's alarm goes off @ 6:50  and then my mom comes in  asking me all kinds of questions  and if i took her blush...i don't wear any make-up, let alone her's). i'm pretty tired right now, but i just can't sleep. and i'm hungry...but i can't really eat... i'm not too sure how well it'll stay down.   in case you guys didn't figure it out... andrew is a really bad influence.  he's a great brother, but a terrible influence. he thinks he's being all nice by watching over me when i'm making my stupid decisions, when it's his fault that i'm messed up enough to make those decisions...lol. honestly, if my mom thinks it's  BETTER  when he's there,  it's not.  if andrew wasn't there last night, i would've been completely sober and i probably would not have hooked up with anybody (oh, i'm gonna kill john o'keefe if he doesn't show me his camera soon...i have nooo idea what he got on there, but i'm sure  it doesn't look good for me ) but when andrew's not there, if people ask me if i want something alcoholic to drink and i say no, they usually drop it...but andrew just eggs me on and pretty soon i have him and all of his friends pushing me to do something that i want to do, but i know that i shouldn't. and don't get me wrong...i don't mean that he's pressuring me or pushing me to do something that i don't want to do...the whole problem is that i  DO  want to do it... and alcohol is terrible, once i have a little bit it's hard for me to just stop...especially after beer, b/c i  hate  beer, so to wash it down i chugged some of kramer's Captain Morgan's...it was good...liquor is gonna be my downfall, i like it too much. jesus christ... andrew has definitely corrupted me ...well, it's all in good fun. anyway, this weekend in general has been crazy...last night i had 3 or 4 'sober' conversations (one was with my mom when i got home...it was bad, i blirted some shit out that i should not have...but i told her i didn't drink anything...i don't think she believed me...she was like, "well, you're acting totally different, you're chewing gum, and you're sitting down and crying in front of me...and telling me why") when i was messed up...but i think i made  some  good decisions...however the good decisions i made benifited other ppl and what they wanted as opposed to what i really wanted. what i need to work on is not being drunk ME...b/c sober ME flirts a little bit...drunk ME flirts with  everybody...and i mean everybody , including chicks  (i luv jill and jessica)  so i've been completely rambling, i dunno if i make any sense right now...then again i only had 3 or 4 hours of sleep, so i'm a little tired. i guess the big lesson i learned last night (combined with friday night/saturday morning) was that  "fun comes first, and hooking up comes second" ...my bro told me that...oh, and drew basically told me that whenever i'm out i'm just gonna be able to choose whoever i want and what i want with them, which is kind of funny, b/c the #1 on my list hasn't  really  talked to me in days and the #2 had something going on and i was such a nice girl and told him that if he didn't wanna fuck things up i'd just get up and walk away and that's basically what ended up happening. **sigh**...it's been a long, eventful, fun weekend, filled with many firsts, hook-ups and lessons.   INEVITABLE   today i get to just chill...jill wants me to smoke w/her, but i dunno if i'm gonna...i LOVE the girl and everything, and i would love to just hang out with her, but i have  two fucking tests tomorrow  and right now i feel really bad about going against my mother, like, 2 nights in a row...i really think i'm breaking her heart and i hate that...but i'm not gonna fuck up my life b/c i know what i'm doing...summer's starting and after the summer everybody who i'm going out with now is leaving (including andrew...*tear*---i cried @ graduation when they called his name...it was bad) so once school starts again, i'll be back to normal. well, not  normal , normal...but normal enough. b/c normal enough is smoking w/jill every once in a while and normal, normal is sitting @ home every weekend and not doing shit.  this week is gonna be crazy...tomorrow i have 2 tests, wed i have 1, then i have to rehearse w/my coach's sister for the songs i'm singing @ her (my coach's) wedding. the rehearsal dinner is thursday, and the wedding itself is friday. i need to figure out who i'm gonna ask to come with me (which is another thing my mom was asking me this morning when she came into my room) there are a few ppl that i'd ask, but i think i would feel weird...so if worst comes to worst, i'll bring jill and if not, i'll bring emily...or maybe even jessica...she knows coach and i've gotten to know her pretty well lately...b/c if i can't have a good guy-friend there, then why not one of my best girl-friends?? my mom told me not to ask anyone until i talk to her again.... so if anybody's reading this post and they got this far...comment or talk to me if you'd like to come with me to my coach's wedding.    why do humans have to be so confusing?? why can't everybody feel the same way about you that you do about them?? why can't in friendships you see the person the same exact way that they see you?? why can't there be just ONE person that you love throughout your life and infatuation and lust and 'like' just not exist?? why does there have to be pain and mistakes for people to learn their lessons?? why, damnit, WHY??? ...things were sooo much easier when boys had cooties...   i think i'm gonna end this HUGE post about...nothing...there...bye everyone

       it's 2:45 pm on june 19th, 2003 (the day after senior prom) and  i've been awake for exactly 29 hours and 45 minutes .  prom was alright...the shore after the prom was crazy...alcohol + drugs + 40 or 50 high schoolers =  drama, fighting and crazy fucking shit.   that's all i have to say about that...

       it's been a  really bad day ...  first of all, my sister's alarm went off @ 6:50 and woke me up...it took me a while to get back to sleep and then i only slept til, like, 9. so i got up, got dressed, ate breakfast and then chilled until 11:45, which is when my sister came home. i left the house @ 11:55 to catch the bus for my Global regents...and i waited...and waited...and then it was abou 12:25 and i went back to my house (the test started @ 12:30). so now i'm freaking out and i called jessica's cell a million times and she didn't answer and then i called emily's and she didn't answer. finally, my sister's friend called HER mom and got her to bring me to the test. i get to the school and it's pouring rain, so i have to walk from the parking lot by the ROTC wing to the front of the school in the pouring rain, it's around 12:45 by now so as i'm walking in mr. gonzalez is telling me to hurry up b/c the test already started. i wanted to be like,  "no fucking shit it already started, but maybe i'd be here on TIME if my bus decided to show up " but instead i just said, "well, my bus didn't show up, so what do you want me to do?". so i'm trying to hurry to my classroom and i walk in soaking wet and someone was like, 'oh, nice of you to come' or something to that effect so i was just like, " oh yeah??  my bus didn't come". by now i was trying REALLY hard to not curse. anyway, the procter tells me there's a seat in the back...i don't think it counted as a seat b/c there was no seat...there were just the  bars  that go under the seat. the test itself was pretty easy but i was having a really hard time concentrating b/c i was so  royally pissed off . i'm not sure how i did, but i know i passed, so i don't even care.  now i'm home and i'm doing absolutly nothing. fuuun-hopefully i'll be able to get out for a little while later. i'd be happy with just driving around for an hour with someone, so if anybody wants to help me get out...gimmie a call...

       sat @ home all day because my mom's  crazy , and she claims that  she's not letting me go anywhere until all of my tests are over.  hopefully it was just because of her bad mood b/c i can  NOT  stay locked up in this house for a week straight. well, at least while i was here i had a nice talk with a (now good) friend, and i was able to sort some stuff out and help him sort stuff out. so the day wasn't a  complete  waste.  a few days ago Javier and Sergio (2 of my brothers' old friends that lived down the street from us on Roosevelt Drive) stopped by b/c they were in the area. it was weird seeing them b/c we haven't seen them in a while. they moved to Texas and i guess they were visiting family and looked us up in the phone book...it was nice, though. after they left, tj and andrew got into a discussion about 'whatever happened to Jonathan Durning?'....  about 10 minutes ago  Jonathan Durning  left my house...i haven't seen that kid in sooo long, it was really freaky. see, he used to live  across  the street from us on Roosevelt Drive, but he moved away a year or 2 before we did and we haven't seen him since. but he called a few days ago (which was really weird b/c it was right after we were talking about him). anyway, he's now working for Cutco (the same place Bob is working..it's a small world) and he came to get my mom to sign this paper saying that he did a demonstration. he really looks like he's cleaned up his act (he moved away because he was having really bad problems with drugs and stuff... i think ), he's going to college and stuff. it's a very weird coincidence that we got visits from javier and sergio AND jonathan all within the span of one week.... very, very weird.   well...i'm gonna get going...tomorrow i have my Global regents, that's fun...i'll write about that when i get back...maybe

        1 down, 4 to go...   i got home from taking my english final about a half hour ago...it was quite possibly the easiest test i've ever taken. the MC after the readings were sooo simple...one question was like, 'how did ivan die?', and the one after it was like, 'ivan dieing of his own fear is an example of...', you've gotten to be a fucking dumbass to get any of those questions wrong. and then the critcal lens was perfect...before i got to the test i said to edene, "i'm gonna use  macbeth, oedipus the king, or the elephant man " and the lens was like, "literature shows that people are responsible for their own destiny" or something like that. so of course i picked Macbeth and Oedipus...their whole point is fate and that shit. so i finished like a half hour before the test was over and then i took a little nap. and it just hit me that i'm never gonna have to deal with mrs. mandel again...that's fricking awesome...  tomorrow i don't have any tests, so i'll get to sleep a little, and then thursday i have global. global's fricking easy, so i'm not even worried about that. the only problem i'm gonna have with these test is that next tues. i have spanish and then math RIGHT after it, so i'm gonna be dead by the time the math regents comes along...grrr...  there's some weird kid IMing me that's cousins with one of my sister's friends or something and he keeps asking me stupid questions...it's really annoying...  yeah...that was pointless...and i'm gonna go...bye

       hey everybody!! no more school...i'm soo happy right now...no more mrs. mandel, no more mrs. medina, no more SPANISH, etc.!!   it was kind of a slow weekend...on friday andrew had, like, 10 people out in the back, so i hung out with them for a while and then just went to bed. saturday morning i had to babysit my lil bro (from 8-4...it was ridiculous) and then i took a nap and then later i went out. i had a good  sober  time (you should all be proud, lol). it's really funny to hang out with a bunch of drunk people...haha...i'm not gonna get into any details...but it was a good night--;) on sunday i had to go to the firehouse w/my stepdad so that i could watch the baby, but that didn't take long...and when i came home i just watched tv and took another nap. and today was the last day of school...mr. rogers did a fucking  backflip  in class...it was awesome. i fell asleep in both of my chem periods, so that was fun (john reynolds threw up out of nowhere, it was so weird)...4th period i did absolutely nothing while waiting for ms.santillo to help me do shit w/the music that i have to sing @ my coach's wedding and then i ended up being late to english which was fine with me b/c i hate mrs. mandel and i'm sooo glad that after tomorrow's test,  i'll never have to see her again.  6th period was lunch...i'm sad about never being able to eat with that awesome lunch table again (i'll cross my fingers...maybe we'll all have the same period again next year...that will be year #3). but i'm mostly upset that i may not have lunch with  JILL  again...that would suck, royally...jill, if you're reading this...we HAVE to hang out over the summer, or i might die...lol...i know you and chris need to chill, too...but he has to share you. 7th was class w/keeperman...he talked for 10 minutes then let us "run amuck"...and then 8th was my LAST class of spanish and more importantly, my last class w/mrs. medina. we did some stupid listening thing and that was about it...i was sooo excited when the day was over...now i just gotta get ready to take  FOUR regents and 1 final ....grrr...wish me luck!!!   bye everyone...i'll come back another day!

       school on monday, 5 tests, and school's over...i can't wait. i handed in all of my textbooks, cleaned out my gym locker and i'm planning to clean out my locker on monday. i can't wait for school to finally be over.  today in chorus me, carolyn and maria separated all of the stupid pieces of music, and then decided to do an interpretive dance on stage...haha..it was really funny...i guess you had to be there. then carolyn drew little smiley faces on each of my big toe nails, and we all discussed piercings and which ones we'd get. it was the best chorus period i've ever had...haha.  lunch was alright, i guess...but they didn't have bagels, so i was upset. however, carolyn made rice krispie treats (Mmmmmmmm....), and melissa and jill both brought in cookies. so that was good. people were also hitting balloons around the cafeteria...there must've been 10 of them...it was so funny. some of them were filled with water and stuff. there were, like, 10 teachers there and they were, like, planning on how to find out who was starting it and stuff...it was really funny....yeah...i guess you had to be there, too.  now i'm waiting for my sister to get off the phone so i can call someone b/c i feel like going out tonight...she's on the phone all the time...it's ridiculous...stupid 8th graders...

       mmmm....Potato, Bacon and Cheddar pizza from New York Brothers is orgasmic...we ordered it @ 6 and it didn't come til 7...so not only was i starving but i had been craving it for, like, a week...and it was  AMAZINGLY AWESOME ...if you haven't tried it...you should, regardless of how you think it looks (my bro, T.J. to be more specific, refuses to try it...more for me!).  that was completely random...but still...  well, i just got out of the shower and now i'm debating on whether or not i should straighten my hair...hmmmmm...

       i got home from school today and worked for about...ummm....3 or 4 hours on my global project...but it's done...so i'm very excited about that. but today in general sucked...math we went over stuff...in gym we went outside and the grass was wet and we played softball and i suck @ softball so i just stood there...but i did get one pretty decent hit. in chem we got a quiz back and i got a 75, which is the lowest grade i've ever gotten in that class, but it's kind of ok b/c i wasn't in class the day we learned the stuff so i did pretty damn well. then chorus comes along...i didn't go to the spring concert so ms. santillo told me i had to go to graduation..w/e, i can deal with that...but now, all of a sudden i have to do a "written assignment", too! she goes, "oh, it's nothing, you just have to choose one song from each of the 4 performances and research it...it's just one page, double spaced,  for each 4 ." what the fuck?? the last thing i need to worry about is how some asshole who wrote a song spent his childhood when i have 4 regents in a week. so i said, "well, can't i just take the 'final' that you're giving everybody instead? i kind of have a lot of work and review to do" (i'm exempt b/c i did a NYSSMA solo). you know what she said?? "uuummm......"(with a little smile)".....no...don't worry, i'll give you til monday" like she's doing ME a favor... FUCK YOU ...i do everything in that class...what's her problem?? GRRRRR...that put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. then 5th didn't help...i've begun to not give a shit about schoolwork and i gave up on english crap a LONG time ago...so i had a test on a Tale of Two Cities today...luckily i got a briefing from alison that helped...and then i just guessed...but i'm a good guesser, so we'll see. for lunch i had french fries which would NORMALLY put me in a good mood...but NO, the woman gave me 2 little trays w/the about of only one tray!! i was SO pissed... 7th we had a bitch sub for global and 8th was spanish, so of course that sucked. but i'm really proud of myself right now...i came home and while andrew was on the computer i did my math (which isn't due til wednesday)  AND  my spanish. i haven't done that in a  LOOONG  ass time...i feel like a good student again...hahaha  hmm...tomorrow night's the music awards thing @ the school...i'm not sure if i'm going yet...but we'll see..

       yesterday sucked...not during school...but i wasn't allowed out after school because it was my  sister's  8th grade dance. why should i care?? that has nothing to do with me and why i can't go out. so i was stuck @ home all night and i got into a  HUGE  fight w/my mom (apparently practicing for my NYSSMA solo means that i'm trying to steal attention away from amy on her 'very special day'...w/e...that's crap), and she gave me this retarded limit on my screenname, so now i'm only allowed on for 1 hour the  whole day ....that's crap...stupid bitch.  this morning i had NYSSMA (@ 10:05, to be exact)and i sucked....a lot. it was terrible, i had almost no time to warm up and my voice just wasn't working @ all. grr...and the sight reading was in 6/8 and i didn't feel like trying b/c i thought i did really bad already (seriously, i sang this song the worst i've ever done it today). so anyway, i got my paper back and i got...a  95  !  i seriously think my judge was on crack when she graded me...my voice cracked 300-million times...i was sooo upset. and then i saw that i only lost 1 point for "tone" and the other 4 were sight-reading...so if i had TRIED, i would've gotten a 99 or a 98....w/e....i'm happy.  that's all for now....bye

       hey hey everyone...i got back from Florida last night...it was awesome! it was 95 degrees or higher each day we were there so i've got some sunburn. it hurt a few days ago, but it's fine now...now i just need to make sure that i keep putting moisturizer on in so that it doesn't peel or anything (i want it to turn into tan and it already started a little on my shoulder--:(). i'm kinda mad that now i have a bathing suit tan line on my shoulders b/c i have a strapless dress for senior prom...but there's nothing that i can really do about it. maybe it'll get a little better by then...  so this weekend there were a lot of firsts:  my first plane ride, my first time in disney world, my first sunburn (yes, VERY FIRST :(), etc., etc.  everybody keeps asking me what my favorite ride was, but i'm not even sure. it's between  Rock 'n' Roller Coaster and the Tower of Terror . we went on both of those numerous times because we had the FastPass thing, so we didn't have to wait on all of the lines.  our hotel (the Pop Century Resort) was really cool...it had 3 pools and we stayed in the 70s and there were Twister boards on the ground and stuff.  well, i'm not gonna get into the play-by-play of my weekend...but i just want to say that i hate landing. my ears hurt SOOO badly for the last half hour of both flights and i had gum. it stunk....

        one of the  scariest  and  funniest  things just took place in my living room:    &nbsp;  ok, a couple of days ago, my brother and his g/f claimed to have seen a mouse in the basement, so we've all been looking out for it lately, but i haven't been worried about it b/c it was supposedly in the basement. WELL, today everybody was @ work and my mom and my sister had just left to go to a&p or something and  the cat just won't SHUT UP.  so i finally get up and look under the couch to see what the hell my cat was being annoying about and  there wasthe mouse (which turned out to be a chipmunk, but whatever) in it's MOUTH!!  so i'm thinking that my cat had  killed  the mouse, so i just called my mom to tell her and she said she was gonna get someone to come over and get it. amy calls back and says they're @ the firehouse or&nbsp;something, and i get up to walk around.  Little did i know , the mouse was actually alive. as i was walking through the living room the mouse (chipmunk) came  running out  from under the couch with my cat chasing it. so i'm on the phone w/amy and i start screaming  bloody fucking murder , which makes amy freak out, and then my mom freak out. the cat caught it in it's mouth again and goes back under the couch. now i think that the cat  won't  be stupid and let it out of it's mouth again...but my cat  is  stupid. i heard lots of scampering and struggling from under the couch and the cat comes out w/out the mouse, hovering around one of my mom's little cabinets. i look behind the cabinet and there's the little mouse/chipmunk thing, so i get some crayons and drop them on it to get him out, and he did get out but my cat was a fricking pussy (no pun intended) and didn't get him. then the mouse thing ran under the radiator, and my mom finally came home, but didn't want to open the front door b/c it might run @ her. Davie shows up and i tell him where i think it went and he starts moving things around,  but he can't find it.  then kevin rodriguez shows up and they go to work, lol. we got them  a bucket, a flashlight, the broom and dustpan, and 2 sets of tongs.  they think they've finally got it cornered, but the mouse decides to  avoid the bucket and run under the computer desk.  then it runs behind the piano. kevin decides to call andrew to see if he can use his pellet gun to  scare the thing  out from there, but  andrew wouldn't tell him where it was,  so amy went looking for it (and found it). my mom told me&nbsp;to go outside w/the baby so all i know is what i heard. amy and kevin had some difficulty loading the gun, but they finally did. kevin was shooting the thing and shot it a bunch of times. then the baby wanted me to get him more gummy things and a drink so i went inside. now what i saw was  sooo fricking funny ... davie's on his hands and knees w/one of the fire-poker things and a flashlight in his hands, kevin's on the other side of the piano w/the pellet gun  (which looks a lot like a real gun)  aimed @ the end of the piano, amy was sitting on the couch, and my mom was sitting on a chair next to the computer but she had  another  chair for her feet. kevin said,  "if someone walked in right now and didn't know what was going on, they'd be very frightened" , boy was that the truth, lol. so as i'm getting the baby everything that he wanted i see kevin's face get this surprised look and  he gave a little scream , lol...and he started shooting @ the floor. davie runs over and they say they've got it in the bucket, but apparently there was a part of the bucket that wasn't on the floor, so davie ran to get the dustpan. when he went back he started, like,  chasing  the little chipmunk around poking it w/the fire-poker and moving it around w/the dustpan.  FINALLY , they chased the chipmunk around the room and out the door.   oh man, i guess you had to be there---hahahaha...well, now that all of the excitement is done, i'm gonna go take a shower or something...

        yup, i just got back from the nanuet mall where they had this contest, and if you win, you get to sing the national anthem at a mets game. i didn't win...but i don't even care. i went into the entire day knowing that i wasn't going to win and i met this  awesome girl  (Jeanie)&nbsp;and we hung out the whole day, and it was sooo much fun! Stephanie Genovese was one of the winners and she was  AMAZING!!!  i'm sooo happy that she won b/c she was definitely better than everyone there---and then these other guys won...they were&nbsp;twins and they were really good and had awesome harmonies. the whole day was a blast...i met  Monkey Boy from PLJ  on the line for ice cream after the competition and he was really nice.  he said i look like Natalie Portman  and that made me REALLY happy. i guess if you make me  REALLY pale , i might look like her...lol. his real name is Joe...he's cute, too!! hahaha. afterwards i went to Barnes &amp; Noble and i got my summer reading books, and waaaay before the lines even started i went to Waldenbooks and got Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire thinking i was gonna read it, but i ended up just hanging out all day. oh man, i have to stuff like this more often...i don't even care if i was 50th every single time!! it was just such a great experience.

       how does it work out that  everytime  i get over something or someone, another thing happens to just suck me back in? it's like, i've finally moved on  (for real).  i don't think about him, i don't talk about him, i don't even get upset when ppl talk about him, and then  bam , i'm right back where i started. i'm just so dumbfounded... why?? &nbsp; it just happens to work out that everytime i&nbsp;disconnect myself, the guy decides he wants to reconnect, or just does it w/out realizing. ggrrr...and now i'm going through everything all over again. i have so many questions, and no way to get any answers. it's so damn frustrating. i'm just so confused right now...  *sigh*...god...life sucks, boys suck (lol jess)  i still haven't found my CDs...i think i'm gonna cry---i can't live w/out my music...  well, i'm about to go out to some firehouse softball game thing---so i'll come back later or something

        i went to the beach with jessica today...it was soo much fun! we met up with one of her male friends from the cruise that she went on (who is extremely cute) and his friend (who's cute as well).  i *heart* the ocean.  we went to this beach that no one really knows about, so it wasn't crowded @ all, it was awesome. when i grow up, i wanna live by a beach...and then i can go all the time. woohoo! so now i have a  "kick ass tan"  (as nick likes to put it) and a bathing suit that has sand in it!! we're going again next week, so i can REALLY become  "black mary"  (according to adam)...i can't wait. when we got back from the beach we decided to go to the game @ the stony point fields  (more cute boys!)  and saw megan and melissa, so that was cool. Haverstraw won...i was really rooting for anyone, but since i live in haverstraw, i guess i'm happy...maybe...i dunno. wow...i'm so boycrazy right now. i dunno what my deal is lately---i guess it's the fact that it's summer...but it's bad. but i realized tonight as i was thinking...i actually have a  *crush*  on someone...it's the first REAL crush that i've had in a very long time...it makes me feel like i'm 10 years old...oh man. by real crush i mean, like everytime you think about him you can't help but smile, and when you see him you have to stop to catch your breath. (i know,  i sound soooo gay and corny right now , but i have to get this all out) and you actually wanna hang out and get to know that person as opposed to just hooking up once and that's it (which is what i've been doing lately). it sucks knowing that i'm never gonna do anything about this, so it's just gonna be a crush until...i dunno when...but that's what i get...**sigh**...   things were so much easier when boys had cooties...  hmm...well...i don't think i have much to say...yeah...hmm...nope, nothing---bye then

         last night i didn't have a dream...but this morning i woke up and then fell asleep on the couch. holy shit,  my dream was SOOO goddamn weird ...an usher video came on and reminded me what it was about. (just wait) i don't really remember how the usher part was in any way related to the rest, but  usher was a giant gorilla  chasing me and someone else (who was a little gorilla) around. and then all of a sudden i was @ my house, @ my computer, home alone (like right now) and&nbsp;out of nowhere&nbsp;everyone starts coming home...billy, andrew and amy are here and then tj walks through in a yellow (yellow?? wtf, he doesn't wear&nbsp;yellow) shirt and leaves, then  ANOTHER tj  walks through in a blue shirt. then i don't know WHERE i am, but  miss piggy  is there and i get in a sword fight (yes, a sword fight) with SOMEBODY and win and then the guy from   Robin Hood: Men In Tights   comes out and fights me, and wins,  leaving 2 little R's on my right arm . then we're back @ home (me, miss piggy, andrew and tj...i THINK), and we're talking about what happened...and then i woke up to a jessica simpson song on the tv.  WTF does that stupid dream mean??  it kind of scares me...just a little...

        on sunday night me, emily, jessica, amanda, paul, victor and mike went to see white chicks and it was  hilarious.  the whole time my finger and hnd were even MORE swollen than on saturday. it was really scary. afterwards me and emily slept of jessica's. yesterday we were all @ my house and my mom noticed that i had a rash on my arm (most likely from the insect bite on my finger) and told me to take benadryl... that made me feel like SHIT.  my whole body was just sooo weak, i basically passed out on the couch and then my mom sent me into my room. i woke up this morning and my finger is a lot less swollen, but the bumps on my arm are still there (they're a lot less noticable, though). my mom thinks a spider must've bitten me. @ 11 i had my first voice lesson w/this lady...and that was pretty good. pretty soon i gotta go pick up my little bro down the street @ his daycare place, and then i gotta watch him, so that should be fun.  tomorrow i think i'm going to the beach w/jessica, but i'm not positive...hopefully i can go.

        this weekend has actually be fun so far. on friday i slept over emily's (well, not actually emily's), we went to her co-worker's party and it was awesome. i'm not gonna go into details, but let's just say  me and her will be lucky if we remember most of the night... i got 2 mosquito bites on my right middle finger, and now it's all swollen... it's really gross.       &nbsp;  yesterday i went to Mountain Creek w/adam, jenny, steve, kevin talgo, andrew, and bob. it was really fun, especially @ the beginning, but towards the end,  we were all in pain from walking around w/no shoes on.  but it was still awesome. the huge raft thing was really cool...i think that one was my favorite...and then there was this funnel ride and it was called High Anxiety...we went on 3 times, and it was really fun, but the 3rd time  i almost fell off,  so that was scary, and it hurt my elbow. all in all it was a really fun day, but when i got home, i basically crashed, b/c i only got, like, 3 hours of sleep on friday night, and then i was walking around all day, so i was drained. my ankle has been hurting for a few days, but after yesterday,  it's dead...ouch.   now i'm watching the baby w/my sister---we're watching Shrek---and i dunno what time i'll be done or what i'm gonna do today. eh...we'll see---i'm too tired to think about it now. bye...

       so a few days ago i was looking for my tv buttons under my bed (i must've kicked them off while i was sleeping) and i found 2 sets instead of one. when i walked into the living room and showed my mom she started yelling at me for stealing the set that belongs in the living room, when it was amy all along (she did confess, though---so i didn't take all the heat). so now everybody is happy and every tv has their remote back.   last night i was on amy's bed watching TV (we have bunk beds, she has the top---it has a better view of the tv) and i was thinking about how weird it was that i found both remotes just sitting under my bed. then i remembered how i lost my "new" michelle branch cd and i decided to go searching for it. i couldn't find a flashlight so i kind of just felt around and tried to see the best i could, but i couldn't find it. HOWEVER, i DID find the walkman that i lost a while ago and some other stuff. isn't it weird how when you go searching for something you find everything BUT what you were looking for?? i was extremely upset when i first lost my michelle branch cd (it was my favorite cd @ the time) and now i'm upset all over again. all i wanted to do last night was listen to that damn cd and i COULDN'T FIND IT...grrr...maybe next time i'll go in looking for something else and i'll find it...hopefully...  anyway...today was another looong day of babysitting. @ least this time we shook things up a bit and watched a lil elmo! and amy was here, so i @ least had someone to talk to.(i was just thinking...it really must suck to be an only child...i get lonely sitting @ my house watching my little brother, but to never have any siblings around? that must really suck---then again, maybe it's just b/c i'm so used to having @ LEAST 1 person over the age of 10 around...and usually there are 2 or 3) and we WERE on the comp. for a while, but it decided to go completely psycho, restarted and then wouldn't even let us open anything. so i got fed up a little while ago and i went and uninstalled massive amounts of things (hopefully nothing important) and it decided to work. so here i am, writing this looong post about random things. i really don't have much of a life these days...being locked up in the damn house sucks. tomorrow i'm doing some singing thing w/some lady @ my aunt's house, and then i'm coming home around 12 and guess what i'm doing?? babysitting--woohoo!! but hopefully i'll be done kinda early and i'll get to go to emily's co-worker's party or w/e...i dunno...i'll keep my fingers crossed.  i think you've had enough of my damn complaining...i'll whine some more tomorrow....g'night  P.S. i'm getting very frustrated right now b/c the bar that's supposed to be on top of this post page thing that allows you to bold and underline and italicize isn't there and i can't bold the things that i want to.  P.P.S. i dunno what i'm gonna do if i have to babysit for another long day b/c i already finished the 3 books i got from the library (it's not really surprising or impressive if you think about it...for the past 2 days i've pretty much been reading non-stop)....man...maybe i'll convince my mom to take me to the library...

       hmmm...this is the third time i've watched Finding Nemo today...and it's only 4. i'm gonna go crazy soon. my little brother keeps trying to get me to ride his little fire truck, and every once in a while he's throwing pieces of his Mr. Potato Head. omg, he just turned on this train...and it just makes a popping noise until you turn it off...i'm gonna go insane. amy was here until 12, and billy and andrew are both home now. but they're doing whatever they're doing and i'm still stuck w/the baby. AND i have to do it all again tomorrow. my mom said she was gonna pay me...but i highly doubt that...this sucks.  so the whole day i've been playing games, reading and watching Finding Nemo...oo, what fun! my mom's supposed to be home around 7, so hopefully i can hang out w/jill and chris for a few hours or somehting...she's going to the shore for the weekend and she's leaving tomorrow...  hmmm...well...nothing left to say...not that any of that was interesting---maybe i'll make somehthing to eat...

       i just figured out that in order to have the "title:" spot when i'm creating a post, i needed to switch something in the formatting thing...i dunno---i'm a loser.  hmm...sry about changing the look of this thing AGAIN, but i decided today to make my own little private blog (for the little details that i have/want to leave out of this one) and i liked the look of this one. so i apologize for constantly changing the template.  ummm...nothing interesting happened today. i woke up around 12, ate, took a shower, went to the library (yes, the library---i couldn't find my card so i had to use my mom's...i got THREE books, but i'm not telling you what..too embarrassed), and came home. i've just been sitting around and watching tv basically. i dunno what i'm doing tonight, but i don't think it's gonna be anything b/c i have to babysit @  7 in the morning  tomorrow....i have to babysit 7 to 7 tomorrow AND thursday, but i think my mom is paying me this time b/c i'm always stuck @ home watching the baby... what a way to waste my summer.  and since i have to babysit really early on thursday, i can't sleepover keira's on wednesday, so we have to reschedule  AGAIN ...this is so frustrating. i'm gonna end up spending the rest of my summer wasting away in my living room watching Finding Nemo 20 times a day b/c the baby can't live w/out it...i need to get out more. i'm not too sure about how many ppl actually read this thing, but if you're my friend and you have my number, give a call sometime, or comment or something...i dunno, i'll do anything to get out of this damn house sometimes.  nobody understands the crazyness that goes on here...nobody!!  when you've got 2 adults, 5 teenagers, 1 toddler and ONE BATHROOM, omg, it's terrible.  SOMEBODY SAVE ME...PLEASE!!!

       plans w/keira fell through again...this stinks, we rescheduled for wednesday. i ended up going to the carnival w/my sister and walked around and talked to whoever we knew. i woke today @ 12 (i think that's the latest i've slept to this entire vacation) and called emily (who was out driving w/her mom, that's dangerous) and we hung out, swam, watched movies and such. now we're @ my house, she's sleeping, i'm making a pretzel, and after i eat it i'm going to bed. tomorrow morning i gotta babysit...again...BIIIIG surprise..then i dunno what i'm doing.  oh, as adam so kindly reminded me...i forgot to tell you all that friday @ the mall on our way out, me, emily, jessica, and melissa saw Adam, garret, steve, and jenny @ the Outback Steakhouse eating dinner, so we stopped and talked for a while...it was nice...haha.   well, i better be going to bed, i have a canker sore and those are apparently caused by stress, malnutrition, or lack of sleep...so maybe i better start catching up on all the sleep i've missed this week or i might get another. bye!

       i've been really busy lately...and tired. the day after gong's 'stay awake' contest,  i was supposed  to go to keira's and me, her and gong were going to see PoA. then it turned out that gong couldn't go, and jill called me and she was supposed to be leaving w/her parents on friday for the weekend (i found out that her and her parents didn't even end up going), so i called keira and rescheduled for tonight and we might go to the carnival. anyway, me and jill just hung out, she made hamburgers on the grill and  set some of the corn on fire.  then we played  "basketball"  (it doesn't really count, we were just shooting around, and  pretending like we knew what we were doing ), and when we got all sweaty we played in the hose (we had put on our bathing suits before). by the time we were done  frolicking  (as jill likes to put it) it was like 10. we borrowed Cold Creek Manor from Jen, watched some TV and then watched the movie and went upstairs and went to bed. my mom got me @ 3:30-ish and i was home for about an hour and then i got dropped off @ amanda alayon's...we chilled for a while, went to her b/f's game, watched Mean Girls (her neighbor had a bootleg copy....it was cute), then we talked til  5 in the morning  and slept til, like 11. my mom picked me up from HER house @ 3:30 and i  thought  i was gonna stay @ home for the night, but then emily, jessica and melissa invited me to go to the mall w/them and i did...i got 2 shirts (1 from hollister for, like  8 bucks  and the other one from papaya for, like 6). by the time i got home it was already 10, i went on the comp for a little and then went in my room and read some of 3rd Harry Potter (Gong let me borrow it-- Yay gong!...she's in china ). then i went to sleep and i had to wake up this morning @ 8 to watch michael...it sucks. i'm still watching him right now and i'm sooo fricking tired.  i'm looking forward to his naptime...b/c then it'll be my naptime, too.   hmm...well, there's not much left for me to say except:  "sometimes i just want to grab her and chink her!" - lol, amanda (alayon)

       sorry that i keep changing my template everyone...the first time i changed it just b/c i felt like i needed a change, then the next day my sister decided to change her's to the  exact same one  because she didn't know I had it...so now i changed it again.  anyway, last night was Gong's  "Stay Awake" contest . me, karen, adam and gong were all competing, lol. Reza and 'Cent were supposed to come, but the didn't, so apparently it was just practice. @ one point we were all in gong's living room reading...quite an amusing site to see. i lost the contest by a long shot---maybe that's because the night before i had gone to sleep @ 4-ish and woke up around 9:30...i was passed out @ 4 or 4:30 in her guest bedroom...adam was  supposed  to bring me home when he left, but he didn't wake me up so when i woke up @ 1-ish, i called him and he picked me up @ 2. i wanted to be home early, though...b/c i kinda had plans w/someone, but not really, but kind of, and now those kind of plans went down the drain b/c i'm babysitting my little brother til 7-ish and then i'm going to keira's...sry---maybe another time.  i think tonight me, keira and gong are gonna go see Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban again (well, me and gong again and keira for the first time)...woohoo!! and then we'll probably end up talking for a really long time like we did @ Gong's the other night.  i haven't seen jill in a really long time...it makes me sad...i think i'm gonna call her...not today b/c i can't hang out today, maybe she can hang out w/me and amanda tomorrow...hmmm...i dunno---we'll see...i just miss her...and we were supposed to hang out.

       it's so late (early). emily's passed out on the couch, amy, danny, mom, tj, billy and michael are all in their rooms sleeping, and andrew's not home yet.  he's supposed to have work in, like, 2 hours and he's not home...he's so insane.  tonight i watched Urban Legend and then put on Urban Legend: Final Cut (didn't really watch it, though). i've seen both of those movies like a year or 2 ago, but amy was in the mood for a  "scary"  one, so we just got them  (she didn't even watch them...grr).  i didn't mind, they were pretty good compared to other movies. i don't know why i'm still up...i guess i'm dreading falling asleep on the floor, and i'm afraid that when  (if?)  andrew comes home he'll scare the crap outta me. i hate having ppl over just b/c i always have to sleep on the floor and then ihave to wake up early b/c of the baby. well, i was just really bored and decided to write, but i'm having a really hard time keeping my eyes open right now, so i think i'm gonna go to sleep.

       my mom didn't let me go to jill's on saturday...i can understand b/c her parents weren't home...but still, i would've liked to. anyway, i ended up going to gong's and that was a lot of fun...me, keira and gong laughed our  asses off . here's an example:  i was telling them that i used to do baton twirling from kindergarten until 5th grade (it's very embarassing)...but i was good @ it...   ME:  we went to nationals and i placed 5th in flag and 8th in two baton.  Gong:  wait, Tubaton?? like Tuba on a stick??  and that was the end of it...me and gong ended up hysterical laughing, rolling around on the floor for 10 minutes and eventually keira joined us, even though she didn't really know what was going on...haha we went to the diner around, i don't even know what time, and on our way out keira (being the gorgeous person that she is) got hit on by some big, old, black guy. when we got back to gong's we were going to watch Finding Nemo, but we ended up getting into a conversation about ...everything... and then passed out around 3.  yesterday was the 4th of July and i went to emily's for her family b-day party-thing...we went swimming in her FREEZING pool, ate, went on the comp., listened to music, played some games, watched tv, etc., etc. today we woke up @ 10-ish to her alarm which would  NOT SHUT UP  (i was ready to throw it across the room), and me, jessica, emily, phil and amy went mini-golfing somewhere in NJ and it was  SOOO FRICKING HOT ...and i  SUCK  @ mini-golf, and i was sweating and i lost and it just was  NOT  fun...i like complaining, you should've heard me...by the time we finished i was sweating like a pig, and i sticky and it was gross. BUT we went to  Burger King  on the way home and that made up for everything...lol.  anyway, now i'm home and i'm sitting here doing nothing. my sister wants to go to the mall, and my mom won't bring her so she's just being REALLY annoying by repeating "mall" over and over again. but maybe she'll get her way...eh, we'll see.

       my mom didn't let me go out last night, but i don't really mind that much b/c she let jill come over and sleepover. so me and jill had a "regular" night---haha...jill had just come from "eating ice cream" so she was  REALLY  funny. we basically just talked and watched TV (True Life: I'm Obese...), but i always have fun conversations whenever i'm with jill. in between  every single damn commercial  we got up and looked in the kitchen...it was really weird, it's not like anything would change...eventually we ended up having french fries and chicken patties (jill got ketchup on her shirt...silly jill). then we watched Holes on one of the HBO channels (i had never seen it before, it was really good), and that ended around 1:30-2ish. then we decided that we were awake enough to watch another movie so we orded  Texas Chainsaw Massacre ...holy crap---i don't get scared that easily (during movies), but i guess the fact that there were a lot of startling parts and jill was screaming, i got freaked out. it was really gross, though. but i liked it.  today jessica came home from her week-long cruise, so we went to her house and hung out...we were gonna swim but her pool was like an icebox so we decided against it. when we left we were sooo thirsty so we walked to the store and bought some drinks and then we came back home. it took us a while, but we convinced my mom to let me and my sister go to the fireworks...so that's where i'm going tonight, but i can't do anything afterwards, but it's all good b/c i'm probably gonna be able to sleepover jill's tomorrow...that should be fun...  well, i'm leaving in about a half hour. i'll come back tomorrow maybe

       report cards came today...but i don't really mind, i'm not one of those kids who steal it from the mail box and hide it so that i don't get grounded.  my grades are fine, so i don't have to worry about that.  i'm pretty happy with the grades that i got on my tests and my final averages. 'cept english...this year in english i was definitely slacking, but w/e... i hated mrs. mandel, and i ended up w/a 90 , so it's all good.. my lowest final average was gym...b/c the last quarter i never got dressed, but who cares... gym is gay .the rest of my final averages range from  96-101 ...so my mom better not be upset or she's insane... wait...she IS insane.   grrr...my mom is being stupid today...when i walked away from the computer before to talk to jill she read my IMs and then was questioning me about them...she makes me mad. and jill just called asking if i could go to her dentist appointment so that chris could have someone to talk to (weird, i know, but whatever) and she said no. she better let me hang out with her later today...even if it's just for a few hours and then we come back here and rent a movie or something.  well...i'm out---i don't even know why i still write in this damn thing... blogs are so pointless ...but w/e...i know i'll be back a few days from now writing again... i'm such a loser...

        my comp. just froze so i lost my entire entry...so this one's gonna be shorter...  so last night i went to tom (guarino)'s house (my mom actually let me...of course, she didn't know that his parents weren't home) for a few hours. i ended up being the  only girl there , and i ended up being the only  SOBER  person there. by the time i got there all the guys (nick, ant, steve, tom, and chris) had already had the equivalent of @ LEAST 7 beers and were still going...by the end of the night some of 'em had had around  13 or 14 ...i had 2 b/c i knew i was going home and  my mom was gonna grill me  (which she did, but i'll get to that later on.) it was really funny (and sometimes uncomfortable) to see them all pretty much hitting on me just b/c i was the only girl there;'can we do body shots off you?', 'will you hook up with  insert name here ?? ', 'do you think i'm hot?', etc. by the end of the night tom broke a mailbox (don't ask how...he doesn't even remember), steve broke a bumper (dunno how that happened either), nick broke the top of one of his bottles (dropped it about 10 times), chris cut his finger (on a beer can) and almost lost his hat, and i don't think me or ant broke anything...thank god. and thank god that when my stepdad got there to drop ppl off (he's so kind), they all acted pretty sober. i don't think i would've known if i was the adult...but i dunno. if danny knew he didn't say anything to me and i don't think he said anything to my mom. speaking of my mom, when i got home she called me into her room and started asking me all of these questions and i answered with a bunch lies... 'were there any other girls there?'  'yup, 2, but they were both inside when danny came'  'what did you do?'  'played cards, but i watched b/c i didn't have money'  'what did you eat?'    'absolutely nothing'    'what did you drink?'  'coke, sprite, dr. pepper...water...'  'hmm...who were you kissing?'  'noone'  'then why are your lips a rosey red that they haven't been in years?'  'umm...i dunno, but i didn't kiss anyone'  'did anyone kiss you?'  'no mom!'  'are you sure?'  'MOM!! THERE WAS NO KISSING INVOLVED'  'mmhmmm...' ' *sigh*, can i go on the computer now?'  'no, it's 12 o'clock @ night!'  'fine, then can i just go to bed?'  '*sigh*...sure'  'wait, you don't wanna smell my breath?'  'nope...' ---and then i walked into my room, changed, turned on the tv, and hopped into bed. that whole fricking time (especially during the kissing part ;) ) i was just thinking  please don't smile, please don't stutter and PLEASE don't put on your lieing face!  my mom is SO good at knowing when ppl lie (she used to work @ a private school for, like, bad kids, so she learned everyone's little ticks...it's sooo scary.) it's not cool @ all. but i survived...thank god. but, you know, the whole 'rosey red lips' thing makes absolutly no sense. i mean, i've come home a bunch of times from parties, or 'get-togethers', or rehearsals or whatever having kissed ppl and she never made any comment about rosey lips. i just don't get it...grr---whatever, she's insane, and we all know it---- i know she knows that i didn't drink @ all...so that's good, maybe she'll start to trust me...  *sigh*, anyway, i'm @ home, alone, again...kinda bored--just chillin watching TV, and @ 3:30 i gotta get the baby (woohoo, what a blast). i think @ 7 there's a firehouse softball game that i gotta go to and then i dunno what i'm doing, but we'll see. well, i'm gonna go...be back when something interesting happens.

       i don't remember most of last night...my whole left side is really scraped up from a pricker bush and i think it's because the person who was carrying me (i didn't want to leave) tripped on the way out. emily's gonna call me later to tell me what happened last night b/c i think i threw up, but i'm not sure. well, actually, i'm pretty sure i did b/c there are some remnants on my shirt , i'm just not sure WHERE exactly. it's almost 11 and i'm still a little buzzed, this is crazy. i feel really bad for emily b/c she went to wendy's and i said i was gonna stay @ the party while she went and i just drank...A LOT...and then she didn't even get to eat her damn wendy's...i don't even know who ate it (i only had one chicken nugget), but that's not cool. but hey, i know i didn't hook up w/anyone!! yay!! that's a first, lol. i had to be home @ 8 this morning and i don't even know HOW i woke up (well, emily woke me up) but i dunno how she woke up b/c the alarm clock didn't go off...thank god she woke me up b/c my mom would've killed me if i wasn't home. i don't even know where this kid's house was that i slept at...man, i really need a nap...i wish i wasn't babysitting my little bro...but @ least the drunken-ness is wearing off, it's more of a hangover now (which sucks, b/c i'm really nauseous when i have a hang over).  ANYway...the other day i went quading w/jessica and she told me to turn around and there was a pricker bush there and it scratched up my right arm (so now my left one matches...yay~!)...it was REALLY fun and now i have an excuse to tell my mom if/when she asks about my scratches..**phew**.  yeah, i barely know what i'm writings, so i'm gonna go and hopefully take a nap while michael wastches Big  Bird (it's quiet time, lol...nevermind).  i hope emily calls me soon...i really wanna know what went down lats night...

       so on sunday me, jessica, emily, paul, amanda, and amanda's dad went to Six Flags. it was the perfect to go. on the way there it was  POURING , and by the time we got there it was only drizzling and 10 minutes later the rain had completely stopped and the rides were all re-opening. by 2-ish it was  beautiful  out, and there were basically no lines. the longest line that we waited on was probably 20 minutes and that was for The Chiller. the other wait ranged from 5-15 minutes. @ one point we went on the Rapids thing and me, jessica and emily didn't get wet. emily paul and amanda wanted to go on again, but me and jessica didn't want to take the chance of getting soaked (i was wearing jeans...wet jeans suck), so me and jessica just rode Nitro until they were done (because it's right next to it). we all went on every single rollercoaster @ least once, and we went on a few other rides. there was some SpongeBob thing that we did, and me, emilly and jessica went on the "dare devil's dive" thing (which was AMAZING) and "eruption" (which was alright...not as good as i thought it would be). by the end of the night, me and jessica rode Nitro 10 fricking times...it was awesome. i have a new goal, too...me and jessica decided that before we go away to college me, her and whoever else feels like it are gonna go to six flags and just ride Nitro the entire day and see how many times we can do it...haha.  so yesterday i hung out w/jessica and we just chilled and then we came back to my house, watched some movies, and then i went on the computer, and then we went to bed. then this morning the baby woke us up @ 8-ish and we went into my mom's room and slept in her bed til 10:30-ish.  it's been a pretty good couple of days...later i'm going w/my mom to get her paycheck, get lunch and then maybe to Mandee.  oh man, i just got my schedule...here it is...lemmie know if we have any classes together:   class Period room teacher SS 1 322 Lefkow Keyboarding 2 108 Donleavy 1st and 2nd quarters Health 2 334 Mackenzie (3rd and 4th) Math 3 210 Ryan Chorale 4 201 Santillo  lunch 5  Physics 6 306 Gunning PersonalSafety 7 gym Munchnick (a days) Physics 7 306 Gunning (b days) English 8 112 Gasparrini   that's not my final schedule, though b/c they didn't put music theory on it, so i've gotta get it changed...i think i'm gonna see if i can just replace Health and Keyboarding w/it...we'll see
