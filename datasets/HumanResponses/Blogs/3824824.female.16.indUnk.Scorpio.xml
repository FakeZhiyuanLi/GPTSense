All the great artist didn't sit around.. so I am not gonna do it either.. I am very ambitious.. and usually get what I want..  a reasonable thing in a reasonable way.. yeah singing big is a dream.. but a dream I hope to conquer... I don't wanna be 30 and wonder what happened.. I thought I was gonna be big.. Well.. I am gonna go for it now I am 16 years old... I have a good chance .. I mean don't you think?! I do..

      Hey!   I have been gone since 2 fridays ago!woo wee... lol... I had a good time... My 4th of July wasn't the best .. but I HOPE yours was!  I went to eat at Lone Star's (or however its spelled) on the 4th then went to Sapulpa to watch the fireworks... then we went back to my dad's house.. and I drove around for a bit... met some new ppl.. who already knew me..(totally freaky haha) and then the next morning we went to Eureka Springs,Arkansas (no its not a water park hahahahah) stayed from Sunday till Thursday.. then came home on Thursday.. then got up on Friday and went to Branson,Missouri.. and that was pretty fun... haha.. I had a great time both trips... at Brason.. I got Slung in a Slingshot thing... and it was recorded and that is freakin hilarious.. haha... and then I rode bumper boats...(and I had a white t-shirt on... )Uh Oh  haha... and then we rode go carts...and that was fun.. my dad and I were really racing.. he passed me then I would pass him.. and I would cut him off..(that was illegal on the course) but we didn't care.. haha.. then I played Lazer Tag.. and I really wanted to play Paintball but ya  know...( I won!!) haha... but yeah it was a good week I guess... not the best... I missed my mommy...:( but now I am home :) hehe... I am glad to be back... I am gonna start working on my music now.. and actually go somewhere with it.. and not be afraid of rejection.. IDK why I am now... ppl say Im really good... but yeah Im gonna go for it!   Random Stuff:  You might be a redneck if... you name ur kid after ur favorite pair of jeans..(LEVI) haha You might be a redneck if you are fightin over what number Dale Earnhardt Jr. really races (81 or 8) haha  Aww... my best friend is priceless.. don't know what I would do without him.. hehe...  Thanx for bringing me back to sanity.... I needed you yesterday.. becuz my dad made me listen to all the old country songs all the way home which was 5 hours! ahh  Neways..

      Hey.. what's up? Well, today I decided to make this so that I can share what all is going on in my life.. and right now it pretty much sucks!  Guys SUCK! (no offense..just some really do!) Neways... I am so tired of being hurt.. and seriously if you are a guy that is readin this..I am sorry but don't play around and get a girl to like you.. when you really don't know what you want..(between two girls)...it makes me so sick.. to see what guys to do girls.. do to me.. these days.. its a harsh harsh world... and I don't know how it all is coming up to this.. I just wish guys could really understand.. but they can't now can they? No offense to all you guys.. I guess I'll just shut up..about that...  I talked to GOD last night for along time.. and prayin for everyone.. then I asked him to please let the sun shine on me today if it was goin to be a good day.. and indeed he let it shine.. and so far its been good.. but IT would be a whole lot better... if I was sharing with someone..  Neways I got up early this morning.. and did stuff around the house.. then I went to get my little brothers and sisters.. some sparklers.. and guess who was there? Come on take a guess.. yeah Coty.. and we talked a little.. I told him straight out how I felt.. and he just said.. you know I don't know what I want.. and I told him that he needs to find out.. and I told him not to mess around when you don't know what you want.. cuz you hurt more than just urself in the end.. but you know.. what goes around comes around.. he'll get his.. I wish I could be the one to give it to him .. lol.. neways yeah.. so I got the sparklers.. then left.. and now I am home.. talkin* to my big sis...(Kat lol) and.. drinkin* a drink from SONIC.. mmm... heh...  I have lost so much weight.. I am excited.. im down like 15-20 more lbs.. then like 3 weeks ago.. this is great... (WAWA is good!) lol...  Tonight I am goin to my dad's... then we are goin to Missouri early in the morning.. and In a way I am ready to get out of here.. but I would rather be goin farther than just Missouri.. if ya know what I mean.. but yeah...  I am gonna go.. I will write in here more later..    CALL MY CELL...405-226-1517...  I will be bored haha   later..
