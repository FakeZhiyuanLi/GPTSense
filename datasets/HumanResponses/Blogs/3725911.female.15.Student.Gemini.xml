      Your personality type is: Ernie  You are fun, friendly, and popular. You are a real crowd pleaser. You have probably been out on the town your share of times, yet you come home with the values that your mother taught you. Marriage and children are important to you, but only after you have fun. Don't let the people you please influence you to stray. OMG!!!wat tha i think there's sumthin' really wrong!!!im not that happy go lucky!!!please!!!well...this is just a test!!
