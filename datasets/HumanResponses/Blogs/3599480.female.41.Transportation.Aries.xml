      FYI -------------------- Army Recalling 5,674 Who Left Service  --------------------  By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer  June 30, 2004, 1:18 PM CDT  WASHINGTON -- For the first time in more than a decade, the Army is forcing thousands of former soldiers back into uniform, a reflection of the strain on the service of long campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Army officials on Wednesday announced that 5,674 former soldiers -- mostly people who recently left the service and have up-to-date skills in military policing, engineering, logistics, medicine or transportation -- will be assigned to National Guard and Reserve units that are scheduled to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan. The first notifications are to be received July 6.   They will be put on active duty for a minimum of 12 months and mostly likely for 18 months. The Pentagon's policy is to not keep troops in Iraq or Afghanistan for more than 12 months.   Robert Smiley, the Army secretary's principal aide on troop training and mobilization, told a Pentagon news conference that more former soldiers, in addition to the 5,674, are likely to get called up next year. He said he could not estimate the number but would not rule out that it would be thousands.   Col. Debra A. Cook, commander of the Army Human Resources Command, told reporters that although former soldiers in the reserve pool known as the Individual Ready Reserve are required to verify by mail every year that they are physically fit, many will be surprised to get called for Iraq duty.   "There's going to be soldiers who, yes, will be shocked," she said.   The Army did not immediately offer a state-by-state breakdown, but Raymond Robinson Jr., a senior personnel official at Army headquarters in the Pentagon, said many are from California and Texas.   People in the Individual Ready Reserve are distinct from the National Guard and Reserve because they do not perform regularly scheduled training and are not paid as reservists, but they are eligible to be recalled in an emergency because their active duty hitches did not complete the service obligation in their enlistment contracts.   It is the first sizable activation of the Individual Ready Reserve since the 1991 Gulf War, though several hundred people have voluntarily returned to service since the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.   The Army is targeting its recall on those who recently left the service and thus have fresher skills than retirees. Any time the military calls on its reservists for wartime duty, political implications arise because of the disruption to civilian lives and businesses. In this case it may reinforce the perception among some that Iraq is stretching the Army too far.   Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday that dipping into the Individual Ready Reserve amounts to conscripting people to fight in Iraq.   "If there was any doubt that this administration was conducting a pseudo-draft, this call-up should dispel that doubt," Larsen said.   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., President Bush's presumed opponent in the fall election, has made similar complaints about the administration's use of Reserves and National Guardsmen. After the Pentagon, stretched by war needs, declared a "stop-loss" this month to prevent the separation of troops, Kerry declared: "They have effectively used a stop-loss policy as a backdoor draft."   The Army said the Individual Ready Reserve members who are recalled will be given at least 30 days' notice to report for training.   Vietnam veteran Chuck Luczynski said in an interview Tuesday that he fears his son, Matt, who is getting out of the Army after four years, will be called back as part of the individual reserves. The son returned home in March after a year's tour in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division, and he has plans to start a computer programming business.   "I think that's on everybody's mind right now, that they took their turn, and they would hope everybody took a turn so that a few don't carry the many," said the elder Luczynski, of Omaha, Neb.   The Army is so stretched for manpower that in April it broke a promise to some active-duty units, including the 1st Armored Division, that they would not have to serve more than 12 months in Iraq. It also has extended the tours of other units, including some in Afghanistan.   The men and women recalled from the Individual Ready Reserve will be assigned to Army Reserve and National Guard units that have been or soon will be mobilized for deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan, unless they successfully petition for exemption based on medical or other limitations.   In January, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld authorized the Army to activate as many as 6,500 people from the Individual Ready Reserve, drawing on presidential authority granted in 2001.   Not until May did the Army begin looking in detail at the available pool of people.   At that point some Army recruiters caused a controversy when they contacted members of the Individual Ready Reserve and suggested they would wind up in Iraq unless they joined a Reserve or Guard unit. Some complained that they were being coerced to transfer into a Reserve unit.  Copyright (c) 2004, The Associated Press

       Well, the MFSO picnic here was a small affair, but a productive one. We had a good discussion about how we might go about changing people's minds about how "great" war is. One of the observations we shared was how much the pro-war/pro-Bush folks base their opinions about politics on  fear : fear of another terrorist attack, fear of people who believe or behave differently than they do, and fear of the world outside the U.S. When we are talking to people who operate from fear, we might make more inroads if we listen for the fear under their position and then address it with the hard, cold facts and suggest positive things we can do as Americans to make the whole world safer. (The old "If you want peace, work for justice" bumpersticker comes to mind.) It helps if we keep track of current developments and feel confident in our own knowledge of the real world. You will have to go outside the mainstream media for the truth, as you no doubt know by now. If you find yourself in a discussion with a pro-war person, ask him or her questions and let's start trying to understand more why they see things the way they do. The  facts  don't support their position! One woman who came to the picnic even said she thought she might go to a pro-Bush gathering just to listen and watch. Anyone else out there feel like doing a little covert action and reporting back to us here?!      We also talked about circulating a petition to send to the White House, Congress, and our military leaders, asking them to end the occupation now that Iraq (supposedly) is back in the hands of the Iraqis. To that end, I have drafted the following:    Young Americans--our sons and daughters--sign up for military duty with the understanding that we will not send them into danger without just cause, and neither the invasion nor occupation of Iraq have proved to be justified. The doctrine of preemptive war is a folly that will only leave America unprotected against the growing numbers of terrorists who have been galvanized by events in Iraq. In our effort to destroy them, we have killed and maimed untold thousands of innocent Iraqis. We have lost nearly 900 brave young Americans, and thousands more suffer life-altering injuries as a result of America’s misplaced “revenge” for the attacks of September 11. Enough is enough.      Now that Iraq has been returned to the Iraqis, we, the undersigned, call on President Bush, Congress, and our military leaders to bring American soldiers home.  We ask the international community to help Iraq determine its future without obligation to American corporate or political interests, and we ask our fellow Americans to look beyond their fears of future attacks and to focus instead on the traditions that once made America a leader among nations and a beacon of goodness in the world.     Is this something you would sign? Is there anything in the language that should be changed? I'd appreciate your input before I begin circulation. Contact me via email or in Comments below. Thanks!

      Went to Al Jazeera and they say more coming soon. If anyone wants:  the site is http://www.english.aljazeera.net Sometimes you can see there what you don't see on our TV.  There is also a hostage (Pakistani) who was working for KBR, a subsiderary of Haliburton. Peace! Teresa

      Finally, I went with my husband and saw this documentary.  I applaud Michael Moore!  Yes, many parts were hard to see, I cried through much of the movie.  I thought of all that I saw last summer there, how the exposions and sounds of firefights never stopped, it was 24/7.  I jumped and cried again as I saw pictures of our soldiers and Iraqis killed.  Crying, because of anger, and sorrow. Memories are tough, I was only there for 3 weeks-I understand what our soldiers will go through when they come home.  I can't even listen to fireworks now.  I think that we should try George W. Bush on crimes against the American and Iraqi people!  Mothers: Keep speaking out!  We are fighting for many lives, American and Iraqi!  If you have not seen this film, I encourage you to go! Oh, God, now I hear on CNN that they have kidnapped a Marine.  I am going to go to Al-Jazerra website in English. Peace!

          I too saw the movie on opening night with family and friends.  It was a very painful movie on many levels...but necessary in every way.  Here in Northern CA it was pretty much preaching to the choir but I was encouraged to see sold out shows and shows added because of demand.  As we were exiting the film, I was also encouraged to see the line for the next showing extend around the theater and most of the people in line for that showing were young people in their 20's.  That was very hopeful for me.  We need the passion and the involvement of these young voters.  Also as I was exiting the film, my cell phone started vibrating...it was my son Jan, calling from Iraq.  I told him his timing was perfect, and told him about the film.  He told me, and asked that I tell all of you, to keep the pressure on and keep seeking the truth and demanding answers.  He says, "Mom there has to be a solution that doesn't involve killing and death."  We need to find that solution and we need to find it soon.     I also emailed Michael Moore and thanked him for being such a strong voice and leading the way for other filmmakers like our own Martin to be the voice of protest for this generation.  They live in the theaters...it's the best place to reach them.  God Bless all you.  You and your children are on my mind and in my prayers daily.  I look forward to meeting all of you and getting our collective voices heard.  I promised my son, I would do whatever it takes to bring him home and keep him from going back (a third time) to Iraq.  He is strong, emotionally, physically, and spiritually...but 3 times? - come on...that's way too much to ask.  Besides Lily Lipscomb, I identified with the soldier in the film who said, You can't kill another human being without losing a piece of your soul.  Those were almost the exact words that Jan said to me at Christmastime before he had to go back for his second tour.  They've all lost enough and my tolerance of this Administration and of Americans who continue to live in ignorance is all but gone.        But I also feel hopeful and strengthened by the Michael Moores of this world and the "Band of Mothers."  Kathy

       I just saw Michael Moore's documentary film, and from a military mom's point of view, it was stunning, astonishing, heartbreaking, and infuriating. Even if you have been playing close attention to the news, you will be amazed at the potency of this film. People here stood on the sidewalk, almost unable to disburse after it was over. Some were crying, some were quiet, some were finally angry. Everyone seemed to want to talk about it. And tickets were sold out through tomorrow. An MFSO mom, Lila Lispcomb of Michigan, provides one of the most compelling segments of all. Drive however far you have to drive to see this important film, ladies. Though it is at times hard to watch, you will not regret it.

      Does anyone wonder what the living conditions are like in Baghdad for the average person? Last summer I spent 3 weeks there.  I visited my daughter at her base everyday and we stayed with Lateef's family!  How I miss them! We may have some things here that are better, but they have something valuable that we do not.  I do not want them to lose it. What am I talking about? Family Ties.  They all take care of one another and it is for all or none of the family there.  Wow!  The Closeness!  The children all grow up together and the family members are so committed to each other!  They are so kind and peaceful unless they feel that the family is threatened!  It is hard for me to find the words to describe what I felt there.  I love each and everyone of them! I hope that Peace can be achieved there, I want to go back and see them.  Now, I have digressed! The living conditions there are terrible!  The electric is on for a few hours and then off for 4-6 hours.  Imagine 130 degree heat with no fan and no refrigerator! The sewage is backing up into the streets and getting into their drinking water!  How many will get sick for the next several years from this?  Luckily, I got bottled water from the Army to drink while I was there!  I was also taking malaria pills while I was there. There has been no trash pickup since we invaded.  Most are burning trash in schools or lots.  Unless they work for the military there are no jobs there; and they have mouths to feed! Lawlessness is out of control!  What control? The old women would sit and shake their heads and say they never had this level of lawlessness under Sadaam!  There are robbreys, carjackings, kidnapping of children for money. Wow!  If I was Iraqi, my level of rage would be very high!  We promised them many things, but have not delivered any.  Why should they keep waiting?  Haven't they been patient for over a year? I visited a medical clinic in Baghdad that was passing out bags of water from the Italian Red Cross that day.  They had no medicine and the Doctor's only equipment was the stethascopes! We took my nephew "Save" who is 9 to the DuBai Hospital in Baghdad.  He has Cerebral Palsy, They examined him and said that nothing to treat him can be found in Iraq! The soldiers at my daughter's base set it up so that a convoy took "Save" his father, my husband and I to another base in Baghdad for a US Army DR. to examine him. The DR. was nice, but told us he could not get treated in Iraq and he couldn't treat him because he wasn't Kristin's dependant. He said that to get the use back on one arm was possible if he got treated and had physical thearpy in the nest year or so. They have to carry him around, take him to the bathroom and feed him.  He has no use now of legs or hands.  But, He is very intelligent!  He understands what is said to him and answers by head movements!   A Army vet here has given me a wheelchair to give to him, but I need someone to help me get it to him over there!  I went to the US Consulate in Baghdad and even asked about adoption; but was told that nobody was allowed to adopt any Iraqi kids at this time! Even if we are related! How Can I get Help for Him? How Can I get Help for the People of Iraq?  I Think by people here in the US trying to help the people in Iraq.  It has to transcend governments, and  religions.,  We have to see each other as just another Human Being instead of "us" and 'Them". Do Unto Others as You would have Them Do unto You! Iraqis are crying for the people here in the US to Help them! Would I go back now ? Yes, if I had the funding I would go back with a camcorder and send daily pictures and truth updates back to the US.  I would go in spite of the danger because I believe that this needs to be done!  I will tell everyone that I can about the crisis of the people there. Can we put our heads together and try to find a way to help?  Teresa

      Gaia and everyone: My computer  got a virus and I had it at the shop.  They had to erase everything and reinstall Windows!  Luckily, I found my invitation saved in an MSN file! YES! Anyway, I am on Prosac now for depression.  Wonder Why???????????? Kristin is still in Baghdad.  Hoping that she can leave to germany by August.  Lateef's family are safe that we know of, the phone lines are not working well there!  Please keep all of them in your prayers! Last night my son called from Ft. Bragg; ( he spent 9 months in Afganistan.)  and told me that he is getting deployed to Iraq mid November.   I hope that we can vote and change all of this by then. The news everyday from Iraq is depressing.. as is the news of how unlawful our government is........ I taught for 9  years in Ohio, Elementary Education. This is not the government that I taught about... "Are we in the Twilight Zone"? I would have never believed that our government could be so corrupt and hurt so many innocent people.... And a majority of the people here are ignoring the facts.....Don't want to face reality?  or don't want to know the truth?  As they say the Truth is Out there.... Comments? Peace!

      Hello all,  Just wanted to share exciting news to all.  I have received an invitation to be part of a BBC TV and radio broadcast out of London on Sunday, June 27th.  It is a 10 minute phone in interview that will be broadcast on London's BBC broadcast system and on the radio.  Maybe we can make a difference internationally, seeing as how alot of Americans have their head in the sand.  That's putting it nicely, we all know where there heads are, and it's up another place on their body.  Let's motivate and get our kids home.  I also got my tape sent in to the Survivor show, asking to be on their next show representing our kids in Iraq and all of us mothers for our kids are fighting the ultimate survivor skills. I thought this would be a good idea to reach the media, if I am selected as a contestant.  Anyway, hope all are well.  Peace, Love, Dove  Terri

      I can't help but be horrifed by the latest beheading. I'm equally horrified by our leaders' response to it. If we refuse to negotiate with terrorists, how will we ever resolve this whole mess? Is this to run in eye-for-an-eye cycles forever? I hope not.  My son came home on leave and made an angry comment about how the news only focuses on the negative stuff. I told him if that would help get Bush out of office I am all for it.   The Asheville Citizen Times had a big front page article about the stop loss and possibility of the draft. They interviewed many people but left the reader with the impression it would not happen. The theme seemed to be that we don't want inexperienced troops or soldiers that don't want to be in Iraq, therefore there won't be a draft. Do they think our soldiers-sons-hunbands want to be there? Are they nuts!? I wrote a letter stating facts they chose to ignore, trying to get people to think. It was not published. No other letters were published, pro or con.   I am happy not to have a jammed up mail ut miss some of the more personal accounts of the other mothers. Here's to them, to us, and to all military families the whole world over...I raise my glass to you. Nanci

      Hi Everyone, Thanks Gaia for getting me access to the blog.  From what I understand, one of the most powerful and compelling moments in Michael Moore's film is an interview with a military mother.    On the subject of film, pieces are beginning to come into place for funding and distribution of Band of Mothers - the documentary.  Hang in there everyone.  We are getting there.  You are my inspiration, so thank you.  It is a process and takes time, and being the male that I am - I want it NOW - actually - last week.   I will keep everyone up to date as we progress.  Take care everyone, Martin

       Michael Moore's new film, "Fahrenheit 9/11," opens on Friday, June 25. An expose of the Bush administration's actions after 9/11 and in Iraq, the movie is the first documentary ever to win the grand prize in the world-famous Cannes Film Festival. The New York Times said, "Whatever you think of Moore…[these are] pictures that have been largely shielded from our view."    I'm going on opening weekend along with other members of MoveOn PAC. I hope you'll come too and see what all the fuss is about. Sign up to come along and find out how to  urlLink buy tickets  at   http://www.moveonpac.org/f911/.    MoveOn PAC is an online group, 2 million members strong, that organizes citizens to work together to change the country this year. (You can check them out from our Links at right.) I hope you'll come along.

      Well, finally got a minute to post onto blog.  Have been away training on my job.  Then first of the month hit, and I am in accounting so way busy.  My son is on his way taking over heavy guns, tanks, missles, and such as a special forces battalion in Iraq in case the June 30th handover breaks down.  Not happy about this.  He left his new wife and unborn child due December 18th behind.  Has been very hard for such a young new bride. Pray he makes it home safe to see his new baby, and in time to support his wife on delivery.  I keep praying for all of yours too.  Will chat again soon.  Peace, Love, Dove  Terri

       Ladies, I am getting encouragement on several fronts to press ahead with the book project about our Band of Mothers. Although there are several projects in progress that are similar, people seem to be particularly interested in hearing it all written from the point of view of the mother of a currently deployed soldier. Some of you have graciously taken the time to answer the first two, and longest, preliminary questions. I am posting the rest of the interview questions here in the hope that you will read them and want to respond.   This project is open to all military moms, regardless of their opinion on the war and occupation. Mothers who have lost sons and daughters are particularly encouraged to use this forum to honor their child's life.   Please email your responses to gaia@ameritech.net if you haven't already, and include a phone number for follow-up questions. I will write up several  chapters based on these responses and submit them to a publisher. If they like it (and a little bird tells me they will), we'll have our book. So here are the questions for you to do when and if you are able. Of course, the timeliness of this project is important, so sooner is better than later.   As always, I encourage you to speak and write freely, not worrying about style or editing. Just tell your story, and pretend the world is finally listening!  ------------------------ INTERVIEW QUESTIONS --------------------------   1. About YOU.  Tell readers who you are, where you came from. This could include any info you feel comfortable sharing about your "demographic," i.e., age, ethnicity, etc.; your family of origin; important events in your life; education; spiritual/religious journey; your spouse or partner; your work; general description of your family's life; places you've lived; how being a mom has changed you.     2. About your soldier SON/DAUGHTER.  What was going on in your life when you were carrying him/her? What do you remember about when s/he was born? What has his/her life been like? How would you describe him/her? How have you seen him/her change over the years? What are his/her interests, aspirations, limitations? Are there particular events that defined this young person? Who is s/he most influenced by, and why? What do you envision for his/her future?     3. About MILITARY SERVICE.  Why did your son/daughter join the military? Which branch did s/he choose, and why? What did he/she expect or want from the experience? Does your family have a tradition of military service? Did his/her impressions of the military change much after boot camp? Have they changed as a result of deployment to Iraq?      4. About the LETTING GO.  Describe the day your son/daughter left for military service, or the days leading up to it and just after it.     5. About HANGING ON.  How do you keep in touch with your child during deployment? What kinds of things do you send him/her? How has your child's deployment changed your daily routine? How do you cope with the stress of knowing your child is in constant danger? How would you describe your child's mental or emotional state at this time?      6. About CHANGING MINDS.  If your son/daughter has come home, either on leave or for good, how has s/he changed as a result of deployment in Iraq? How has your family changed? What effect has your child's deployment had on you in general? What do you wish people who support this war and occupation could understand? What would you like to tell them? If you support the war (or did), what, if anything, has changed your opinion?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

       If you live in the Chicago area or in one of the surrounding states, join us for a picnic in the park on  Saturday, June 26, 2004, from noon to 4pm . This will be an opportunity to relax in the sun, meet other MFSO families, and talk about possible future events and activities. The press will be invited, so if you want to speak with them, you will have the opportunity--if they show up. But this is not a protest. It's a picnic and informal meeting.   I know this is fairly short notice for a busy season, but this picnic will take place just a few days before the so-called "handover" of power to the Iraqis, and it is an important opportunity for us to voice our opposition to the ongoing occupation.    The picnic will take place in  Scoville Park in Oak Park, IL , a western suburb of Chicago, on Lake Street between Oak Park and Harlem Avenues. This park has several parking garages nearby and a large World War I memorial at its center. It is surrounded by eating establishments, so you can walk a block or two and bring lunch back to the park, or you can bring your own. Scoville Park is  NOT a BBQ/playground park , and we'll have to bring lawn chairs or blankets to sit on. The park is adjacent to the public library, a tennis court, and a shopping district, one block from the Green Line "L." Scoville Park is a highly visible spot in the center of a progressive community. I'm proud to invite you to this lovely, historic suburb for our first meeting. Email me if you have questions or if you need directions. It would be helpful to know how many people are coming.

      Ok ladies, here is something we can do to really help. I am writing to Camilo and to his CO. I am going to see what I can scrape up to contribute too.  Thanks to everyone who has let me work on final papers this week. I am done with the lat one, and now I just have some essays to memorize for an in-class final on Wed. Please read Maritza's letter below, she is one of us.  Love and peace to all. Adele     My name is Maritza Castillo, a member of “Military Families Speak Out”, and mother of Sergeant Camilo Mejía.  On the 21 of May, after a trial carefully scripted by the Army, my son was found guilty of desertion and sentenced to one year in prison.  In their continuing efforts to punish him, a few days following the trial he was shipped to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to serve his sentence thousands of miles from his young daughter, his family, his lawyers and the peace organizations and friends that support him.  He was sentenced for disobeying an order to return to Iraq to kill people of a sovereign nation; sentenced for returning to the army to denounce abuses being committed against the civilian population, young soldiers, and prisoners of war; sentenced with the same sentence given to a soldier who, following orders of superiors, participated in the abuse of prisoners.   I am announcing to the people of the United States of America, of Iraq and the world that I am not giving up my struggle for my son and against this immoral and disgraceful war; I’ll not rest until my son receives justice and this illegal, immoral war has been ended!!!  I am asking people who support Camilo to write to General William G. Webster, Jr. (address below) to ask him to reduce my son’s sentence out of consideration of his request to be considered a conscientious objector.  Camilo decided not to return to Iraq for moral reasons, not from cowardice.  General Webster has the power to reduce his sentence.  In addition, please ask Gen. Webster to make a transcript of the trial available as soon as possible because my son’s appeal cannot be presented without it. Send a copy of this letter to Camilo’s lawyer (address below) so support for the sentence reduction can be documented.    We are also asking that you write letters of support to Camilo (address below), with a copy to me (address below) so we can be sure that his correspondence is not being destroyed – a violation of his rights and another method of making his punishment more severe.     We are also asking that people around the world contact the Costa Rican embassy in their respective countries and urge them to demand that the treaty between Costa Rica and the United States of America, which clearly establishes that a Costa Rican citizen can not be forced to extend his military service, be respected.  The North American government has ignored this treaty, first ordering Camilo to go to war, then arbitrarily extending his term of service, and finally denying defense lawyers the use of this treaty during his trial at Ft. Stewart on 19 May 2004.   This treaty takes priority over “Stop Loss”, the order that the U.S.Army uses to retain U.S. citizens in military service in times of war.  Stop Loss should not apply to Camilo because he is a citizen of Costa Rica and not the United States of America.  As a sovereign nation, it is important that the government of Costa Rica enforce this treaty. Contact information for the Costa Rican embassy or consulate nearest you can be found at http://costarica-embassy.org/ .   We’re also asking for your financial support to continue working to free Camilo, to continue working for peace and to guarantee that justice will prevail. You can make donations to the Peace Abbey/Free Camilo. (Address below).  At the bottom, you will find the addresses of Gen. William G. Webster, Louis Font, and Gale Glazer (Camilo’s lawyers), Lewis Randa, The Peace Abbey, Camilo and myself.  There are also websites listed that offer information about Camilo.    Peace for the people of Iraq! Peace for the world! Bring our soldiers home now!  Sincerely yours, Maritza Castillo, mother of Camilo Mejía   Major General William G.

       I found a  urlLink web site  where people can get registered to vote on-line (unless they are in NH, ND, or WY). It also says under "Exceptions" that soldiers stationed away from home should "the Federal Postcard Application available to you from military bases, American embassies, or consular offices."    We need to get our kids busy with this now because it takes some time to submit ID from home and get your registration card and absentee ballot. We also need to encourage the soldiers who've returned home to register or update, too. Many soldiers, because they are so young, did not register before they left. I have heard that the military is not making these applications widely available. Any ideas on how we can circumvent this problem and help get out the soldier vote? Perhaps help each other out by gathering up applications from our various locales to send to soldiers from our area?

      Here is what I've come up with so far, with help from Martin and William Shakespeare.  "If the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs, and arms, and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, 'We died at such a place.'"                                           William Shakespeare,  Henry V    Band of Mothers  We are mothers of service men and women who are speaking out together against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are united in our support of our military, our country, and our children.   Our Mission  It is our children's responsibility as members of the Armed Forces to protect and serve our country as they are called upon to do.  It is our responsibility as citizens of the United States, and mothers of our children, to ensure the missions they are sent on are honorable, just and necessary.  United as mothers, we seek to bring an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and to bring all our children home safely.  Once this mission is accomplished, we intend to use all our powers as citizens to ensure our children are never again called upon to fight an unjust, dishonorable, unnecessary war.     Please Join Us  If you are a mother, a father, a sister or brother, man or woman, who are concerned about the direction of our country, the use of our military service members, or the motivations behind these wars, please join us.  If you have young children, we ask you to consider their future if preemptive wars remain the policy of the United States.  If you have teenage children, we ask you to consider the growing possibility of the military draft returning.

       (I posted this in my  urlLink personal blog , but I think it bears repeating here.)   • President Bush’s own  urlLink military advisors  estimated that the U.S. would need 300,000 soldiers to secure Iraq. Coalition forces have never exceeded 138,000.    • Of 553 members of Congress, only  urlLink one  has a child in the military's enlisted ranks. (Six are related to military officers.)   • Soldiers were sent to Iraq on false premises, poor intelligence, and/or blatant lies, creating an ongoing sense of  urlLink confusion  about the  urlLink mission  and our proper treatment of the Iraqi people.   • Soldiers were sent into Iraq with  urlLink inadequate body armor  and  urlLink vehicle protection  (one soldier's story  here ).   • Troops deployed to Iraq were not given any information about Iraqi culture or customs and they were not taught even the simplest phrases in  urlLink Arabic .   • Troops in Iraq are receiving  urlLink substandard food  and  urlLink medical care .   • Troops in Iraq are being exposed to  urlLink depleted uranium .   • Female troop members are reporting a rising number of rapes in the ranks.  urlLink Reported incidents  are met with  urlLink indifference and intimidation .   •  urlLink Suicides  among troop members in Iraq are unusually high.   • Injured soldiers who return to the U.S. are being  urlLink denied health care  and other  urlLink benefits  of post-war service.   • Stop-loss orders are indefinitely  urlLink detaining soldiers  whose enlistments have ended or whose retirement date has passed.    • Extended and repeated  urlLink deployments  are ruining families and careers.   • Our soldiers’ ultimate sacrifices of life and limb are being treated like a  urlLink dirty secret , so  most Americans have no idea of the true cost of this war to those who are fighting in their name.    And then there is the other reason, the most compelling of all: We gave life to these soldiers. We are bound by God or whatever makes the universe coherent not to be complicit in their deaths! If you can think of other reasons, shout them out in "Comments" (below).

       I watched John Kerry's acceptance speech with some trepidation last night, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, even moved at some points. Did anyone else watch? What did you think, especially about the way he addressed the concerns of military families and promised to bring our kids home? Do you think he changed anyone's mind?

       Hello again. I just got back from Hawaii, where I spent time with my daughter and we celebrated her 19th birthday. I also learned a lot about the Army and how it operates. For now I'll just say that the word "Army" conjures up a picture of a huge meat grinder that destroys everything in its path. It is truly an insane, devouring mechanism with no regard for people, the earth, or logic.   After doing blood tests for a couple of weeks, the Army doctor (who was about my daughter's age, from what I could tell!) decided that Caroline doesn't have cancer after all. That's the good news. Something is clearly wrong with her reproductive system, though, and my questions about that were met with some bizarre revelations. For instance, did you know that Army doctors "do not have access" to pathology reports from the field?! That's like having your family physician tell you that the lab can't give him the results of your urinalysis. The doctor decided to send my girl back to Iraq without assessing what IS going on with her and why she has had two "miscarriages" even though she had a Depo-Provera shot in January. And even though they say she has had miscarriages, no one has identified any "products of conception" at any point. My daughter has explained to them numerous times that she could not have been pregnant because she has not been sexually active (in addition to the birth control shot). Doesn't seem to matter. Apparently, Caroline's diagnosis came from higher up---they needed all hands on deck in Iraq, so her sudden bouts of heavy and unexplained bleeding are  her  problem. This from an Army that didn't take into account the presence of female soldiers when they stocked the PX on base in Iraq.     Just so you have a handle on how the Army operates, Caroline had received orders that said she would be held back from deployment for a year. The Army put her in family housing on base, where she was just getting settled in, and her foot locker is in transit back from Iraq. She'll probably pass it on her way back to the field, where she is being sent with no uniforms, no answers about her health, and nothing familiar to comfort her through the terrifying ordeal of flying into Baghdad again.

      Hello Ladies, I wish more of us used this blog, it is a convenient way to communicate without clogging our personal mailboxes. Baby is not here yet, when he arrives I will let everyone know. I am re-publishing the speech I will give in Japan in it's finished form here, so that the people who asked about it can read it. You may quote it as long as attirbution is made to me, in other words, the information on there as to location and author must be quoted with it. How are all of you?                 August 21-22, 2004 Japan Mother’s Congress speech              My name is Adele Kubein. I am a master gardener, a mother, and a student. For 26 years I have tended people’s gardens for my living. My customers are my friends, and one of my favorite friends is a tiny Japanese woman named Michiko. Michiko lived near Hiroshima during WWII. After the atomic bombs were dropped, her starving family had to eat the weeds covered with radioactive dust to keep alive. She has fought cancer ever since, first of the thyroid, then when her thyroid was removed, of the throat and now of the lungs. I have watched her fight for life for many years now. We share many things; the love of the garden, the love of our children, and our desire for war to end forever. Michiko tells me that after all these years it still makes her cry to see old films of the war. Through Michiko and others I know, I carry with me knowledge of the pain of many wars: the war Michiko lived through, and the Vietnam War which killed so many innocent people and left my friends with deep scars, I carry the pain of my daughter, sent to fight in Iraq. This knowledge urges me to work for change in the small ways I can.             In 1998, my only child, my daughter, enlisted in the Oregon National Guard. The Guard’s main purpose is to serve the people of our home state, and to be ready to serve in a disaster situation. Her contract stated that even though her unit could be called to serve in time of war, she would never be in combat. I was nervous about it, but she said that she needed money to finish college, and that she wanted to help the people of our home state with her public service.             My daughter continued her studies in marine biology at the local university, and I began to attend college myself. After September 11, 2001, I feared what could happen to my daughter, to people in the Middle East, and to our soldiers. I remembered the results of the Vietnam War. Once I heard the drumbeat of war returning to stir the American people, I began to speak out for peaceful solutions by writing articles for the college paper, and to the newspapers. Many people ridiculed me and said I was un-American. Long before I knew my daughter was going to be directly involved, I realized this was a life-or death situation for many thousands of people, Iraqi and American.  As soon as I read about Military Families Speak Out in a news article, I wrote to Charlie Richardson and Nancy Lessin, husband and wife, who, along with another military parent, Jeffery McKenzie, founded MFSO, and I asked to join.           Nancy and Charlie’s son Joe, is a Marine, and just as I knew my daughter would be in danger, they knew their son would be sent to fight someone else’s war. In October of 2002, Nancy and Charley met Jeffery McKenzie at a peace demonstration, and together decided to form an organization to give military families a voice with which to speak out. They realized that as family members we had a special voice to speak with, a voice that might prevent the invasion of Iraq. To give the families a way to connect, a web site [1]  was created by Nancy and Charley. Within days of their first press conference Military Families Speak Out had about 200 new members. During the months before the invasion Military Families Speak Out members met with Members of Congress and Senators; wrote letters to George Bush and local newspapers; stood at vigils and spoke at local and national demonstrations; participated in educational forums held at universities, churches, community centers and union halls; spoke from the stage in New York City on February 15, 2003, and held press conferences. A group of 15 parents of soldiers brought a lawsuit against George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld seeking to prevent an invasion of Iraq without a real Congressional Declaration of War. One of the most important things that we did then - and still do today -- is to let people know that the best way to support our troops is to not let them be sent into reckless military misadventures. In the U.S. too many were saying that in order to support our troops, you needed to support the war. MFSO provided an alternative view: support our troops – bring them home now!           It is now 20 months since MFSO was formed. We now have over 1,500 military families who are members, with more families joining every single day.Approximately 30 member families have lost loved ones in Iraq. Many more have loved ones who have had their tours of duty extended, or have been wounded in Iraq.  For those families who have had their loved ones return, we know that they are neither safe nor sound. Many are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; they have been exposed to depleted uranium. These are things that will put them -- and the people of Iraq – at risk for decades to come. MFSO families have been the first to expose the risks our troops are facing and the things that are happening to the Iraqi civilians. They spoke to the media and the public of the lack of equipment, water and food that our troops experience, and the suicides and morale problems. Military Families Speak Out is a strictly volunteer organization, there are no paid staff members, travel and some other expenses have been paid for by donations from non-profit organizations. MFSO not only gives the families a way to connect with each other and the media, but it also refers families to other organization that can help their loved ones. MFSO members have been invited to speak in Canada, Japan, France, England, Italy, Spain, Turkey and Australia. We will continue to speak out across the U.S. and around the world until we have helped to end this war, bring thetroops home, and end the policies that allowed this illegal, immoral war tohappen. Nancy and Charley send this message to you:”Our hearts go out to the people of Japan, and Japanese military families andtheir loved ones who are serving in Iraq. We wish your government had nevermade the decision to send them - we say to the government of Japan: bringthem home now!”             Personally, Military Families Speak Out has put me in touch with journalists who want to hear our story, and helped me to reach far more people than I ever could have on my own. It has given me strength to know that I do not stand alone.             I also belong to a group called “Band of Mothers”,  [2]  these are mothers of troops. Some of the Mothers also belong to Military Families Speak Out, and all of us work to bring our children home along with all of the troops. We give interviews and write our local papers, and most importantly, we speak with the other people in our towns and cities to help people to understand what we have learned from our children about the Iraq War. I have first-hand knowledge of what our troops face. My daughter wrote, called, and e-mailed me every chance she got. She was stationed in Mosul, Iraq for ten months, until she was injured and sent home. Her unit was told they would build schools and homes in Iraq, that they would be welcomed as liberators. Instead she was put behind a 50 caliber machine gun, with no body armor, or even any ammo at first, to protect convoys of private contractors in Northern Iraq. In the first days her unit had minimal ammo, one meal a day, and hardly any water. She rode on roads covered with depleted uranium dust and littered with burned cars full of dead bodies. She was told not to breathe the “red dust” of the uranium, but she had no protection.             Listen to a few words from a letter my daughter sent me from Mosul, Iraq in mid-April of 2003:             “Dear Mom, I have angry moments, frustration, all those things I had before, but I also have found something else. I cannot describe the joy I have in living. Even the bad moments, I find something of beauty around me. I hold to this with all my power.             I may not be able to change the situations I face, or the world here, but I can hold true to the things which make me myself. I will change. I will come home different. But I will not let go of this joy in life. I will not let go of the ability to find beauty in squalor. I can’t explain the faith that surges through me, but I know that I will return whole.  I will not let this tear me apart.”              Mothers are naturally fearful; we worry about our children’s safety, but most of all, we worry that they may do something that they can never erase, something that will change their lives forever in ways that will always cause pain.             I raised my daughter to love all life, to respect all people.  She saw the Iraqis as people like herself; she could not reconcile that with the things she saw and did in Iraq, and it has torn her apart.             When she called me sobbing and told me she looked in a young man’s eyes as he died from her bullet, she knew she had lost her humanity for a time. I wept with her. I knew that now there was no going back on the long term effects of her decision to serve her country. She will bear the burden for the rest of her life.             Right now my daughter awaits surgery on a base in Colorado, and she wakes screaming from dreams of death at night. Her body and her mind will never be young and joyful again. She is my closest friend and companion, her grief is mine.             We are all brothers and sisters. We must realize we all feel the same and bleed the same. I have to believe that we are the future. We have the power to be heard, to change things, and to lead us all to a more civilized future. It gives me hope to see all of us here together, and strength to go on working toward peace. I want to thank all of you who give of your time and commitment to work toward peace. It is easy to live one’s life saving all effort for just those around us. To put your energy toward making the world a better place is the greatest gift; one that makes us better as it improves the world not just for our children, but for all.  Adele Kubein P.O.

      Hi Everyone, and welcome to the new moms that have joined.&nbsp; I have been networking with Move-on, the LA County Democrats, and various organizations, and of course working the entertainment industy contacts to bring in funding so that we can begin traveling and&nbsp;interviewing many of you.&nbsp; It is a process, and I thank you all for you patience.&nbsp; This will happen - I know it.&nbsp; The most important thing that I keep feeling is that this movement of mothers&nbsp;is&nbsp;REAL now - it is happening and I am thankful that you all came together to start this movement.&nbsp; It will take&nbsp;many forms, including film, interviews, marches, books, music, art, politics, and so much more.&nbsp; It is for each person to decide what role they would like to play.&nbsp;  I just saw a screening of "Outfoxed" a documentary about Fox News and it's not so secret slant in favor of anything WAR or BUSH or REPUBLICAN.&nbsp; It is amazing today that an entire network can choose this and pass itself off as "Fair and Balanced"&nbsp;.&nbsp; Anyway, as I am meeting about acquiring funding and distribution for Band of Mothers I am also inquiring about other avenues for you all to go public and tell your stories, such as Oprah, O Magazine, etc.&nbsp; So keep going everyone - this is a movement that cannot be stopped.&nbsp;  Martin

      My daughter Kristin is now in Kuwait, waiting to go back to Germany.  She has spent 1.5 years in Baghdad.  She will come home on leave mid August!  She wants to look into college, but I don't know with the Stop-Loss if she will get out in the next year. My son, Teddy at Ft. Bragg called me yesterday and said that his unit got "warning orders", that they will get sent to Iraq very soon.  His shoulder was hurt jumping out of a plane, he doesn't know if they will deploy him anyway. We haven't heard from Lateef's family in Baghdad for awhile.  Hopefully they are OK.  Let's all gear up to defeat Bush in the fall. We know that they released napalm at the Baghdad airport when US troops entered Baghdad.  Adele tells us about the depleted uranium in the North.  Lateef says that his family told him that the South of Iraq is not livable now.  Even though we drank bottled water there, what chemicals was in the food and air there?  Makes me worry not only for our troops, but what about the Iraqi people?  I will finally start writing about what I saw in Baghdad, and scan pictures into my computer.  Let me know if anyone wants to see pictures after I get them scanned. All of these people will be scarred for life, the world waits for us to stop our government.  Are we still planning a march in Oct.?   Peace, Teresa

       As several of you know, my daughter has been sent to her home base after being in Iraq for six months because she developed something called Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia, a type of cancer of the reproductive system. She is currently at her home base being monitored and will not be redeployed for the next year--or so we're told. Apparently, this type of cancer is occurring in female soldiers at an unusually high rate. One woman in my daughter's unit had it already, and I have heard reports of two more soldiers in Iraq who were diagnosed with it. I suspect that the combination of numerous vaccinations, the stress of deployment, a poor diet, and exposure to radiation all contribute to this type of cancer. Have any other moms or wives out there heard of this or had experience with this disease? If so, I'd like to hear from you. Reply in Comments (below) or  urlLink email me  directly.

      Hi there - Gaia - you may be way ahead of me, but I found this website for circulating on-line petitions.  I am sure there are others, but this one claims to be free and I saw some petitions that were somewhat in alignment with Band of Mothers, one wanting to remove Rush Limbaugh from military radio.  Here is the link:    http://www.petitiononline.com

      Dear moms. it is not completely certain yet, but I may be going to Japan at the end of August, courtesy of a group of mothers for peace. I am not sure of the details, but 4 mothers from other nations are invited to Japan to participate in a gathering of mothers for peace. MFSO has asked me if I would be the US representative. If this works out, this will be the most exciting summer of my entire life (after the summer of '67!), a trip to China, a new grandson, and the opportunity to network with mothers from around the world. The opportunity to be an ambassador of peace from the United States is very valuable to me. I think it is important to show the world that not all Americans want war, and mothers all over the world have a bond in common that all of us can understand. I will keep everyone posted on developments. I am packed and ready to go to Colorado, I will arrive there at 2:30 am on the 7th. The time really does not matter since I am still on Beijing time, and that should be just about right!!!! My love to all, and my prayers to all of our loved ones. Adele.

      Hello ladies, many of you asked me to post about the China trip. This will take more than one post, especially since my time-addled brain is functioning so slowly, but installments are cool too. Kids in modern China learn English from the 6th grade on, and have to pass a proficiency test in English to graduate from college. Many still do not speak English at all and many very rudimentarily (like my Mandarin), but they speak enough to get the message accross.  Universally I was asked the same questions and heard the same statements. First of all, the Bush administration has convinced the Chinese that America is crazy enough to go to war with Cina over Taiwan. The Chinese do not stop to think that we obviously can't even subdue a poor nation like Iraq, and they do not for a moment think we can beat them, but they are convinced that the American people are so war-mongering that we will do the unthinkable and go to war over our interests in Taiwan. The reality is that so much of our interests (1.6 billion a year in Wal-Mart sales alone) are tied up in cheap Chinese goods that if we did attack them it would not only ruin us militarily, but it would ruin all those people who depend on the exploitation of the Chinese people to provide us with useless garbage at cheap prices. The shadow of the Bush administration has clouded even intelligent minds to the reality of how futile it would be to fight China. The other comment that came up was that all of China, and I do mean the great majority is outraged at the arms sales the Bush administration had made to Taiwan. The Chinese can see the de-stablizing effect the US meddling is having on a situation that will doubtless work itself out without our meddling. Many people said that Americans were OK, but that our government has no right to attack China's government on human rights issues since we are slaying countless innocent Iraqis, and they are entirely correct.  They love American ways, and crave to live as we do, own what we do and wear what we do, but strictly on their own terms.  China has a vibrant sense of community, and the people, when away from the tourist areas, are so very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the time there very much, and want to go back.  The Chinese love their children, and keep their communities clean and safe. We lived in a non-western area, strictly Chinese and very old, the homes were about 400 years old. We grew to know the people in the neighborhood, and played with their children, saluted their grandmothers and conversed with the students.  I will write more when I get my head clear, I have had five hours of sleep in two days. I am feverishly working to get all my yards done and I will leave for Colorado on the 6th to help my daughter get ready for the home birth. I sure look forward to catching this baby. I never thought I would help in the birth of my own grandchild.  I thought about all of you and your kids when I was away. I was immersed in a community that generally takes care of it's members and I thought of how much we Americans could learn from other cultures. I also thought about all of the generations it will take to put Iraq back together, the families who have been rent asunder there, and all of the bad things people, Iraqi and American are doing to each other. There are other ways of being, I have faith we will evntually find them. Love and peace ladies. Adele

       I don't know if any of you are still reading the web log, but if you are, I want to direct your attention to the Links section at the bottom right of this page. I've added some links that might be useful to you (Mothers Opposing Bush) and your soldier (GI Rights Hotline, Iraq Veterans Against War), in addition to the generally supportive MFSO site and Bring Them Home Now. Check them out. Every time someone visits a web site, it moves a little higher in the web hierarchy and becomes more visible to people doing searches!   If you know of any others that might be of interest to our members, let me know.

      Hey ladies! Stacy and I are mentioned in this weeks online version of Business Week on the front page article about military families. The baby was born by emergency c-section on Thursday the 5th at 1:11 am, the midwives were great and the labor was strong, but the baby's ear was facing where the top of his head should be, and he could not move once the water broke, so the 24 hours of hard labor did not budge him into positon and she had to have the c-section. Mother and baby are fine. His name is Tyree Nathan , he was 8lb 3oz, and he has more hair than most adults. Long, black, hair, a full head. As soon as I get a digital photo I will post it. So much is happening this summer. Off to Japan in 11 days!!! Let us hope the army does not declare her fit to serve after the operation in two months, I am hoping the publicity alone makes her too much of a hot potato for the army to redeploy. My best wishes are with all of you, love, and peace, Adele
