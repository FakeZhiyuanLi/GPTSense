       We now interrupt your regularly scheduled program for a very important message from Jazz.   Hello men! I've recently received your memo about your desire for all of us full figured women to change ourselves to look like the girls in your beloved music videos. I'd like to say that I send my condolences for the loss of your ever-loving minds. I have never, do not, nor will I ever be a size 4. And for those who have ever said to me anything along the lines of "You're a wonderful woman but I wish you were smaller..." , I invite you to try and find a woman of my caliber who is going to respect and accept that comment. You simply wont. If you'd like to have a super model, I encourage you! Go right ahead! If thats what will help you sleep better at night then you have my blessing. However, if you want a woman of virtue, class, respect, integrity, and confidence, it surely will not be detremined by how many times you can wrap a string of spaghetti around her waist.   I am from a breed of women who believe that if you are hungry, then you should eat. I don't believe in wasting my hard earned money by eating food and then puking it up all night. Spending my day in the mirror wondering if my jeans 'make me look fat', walking aroung light headed with a purse full of crackers, and losing my hair just does not appeal to me. Therefore, I will not be breaking my behind to be your Barbie doll. Food is not our enemy and I'm sorry if your teeny weeny friends like to think so.  Just for clarity, I am a size 14, healthy, agile, confident, and blessed black woman. I love who I am regardless of what section of the store I shop in. So next time you come home to see your beautiful size 4 girlfriend hugging the toilet bowl in honor of her girlish figure, be a gentleman...hold her hair for her. Maybe even make her a sandwich. But whatever the case may be, love her. As for me and the countless other full figured women in the world, we will continued to buy our plus sizes, eat our cheeseburgers, strut our voluptuous behinds and love it. I love my small women, yes I do. You're blessed. But don't be afraid of dinner. And men, what ever you like, like it. But remember, your happiness does not lie in your womans dress size, but in her heart.  That is all.   Now back to your regularly scheduled program...

      He's so beautiful to me. He's an awesome guy, but I find myself wishing and hoping the he doesn't say the dreaded 3 words that I think he wants to. You see, love is pretty serious! People kill themselves for lack of it and make fools of themselves to obtain it. We chase after it so passionately yet run from it so desperately. Love is that one thing that we can depend on making us feel like a million bucks, when its good. But when it goes bad it can be that beautiful disaster that slides deep into our chest, piercing our heart and every other emotion and thought on the way in. Love can make the toughest man crumble like a cookie. It can make the smallest man seem like Hercules! It can make the most unattractive of men look like Morris Chestnut...well, maybe not exactly but you get my drift! So, you see, love  is  pretty serious. Still, when I talk to him, I hear 'love' on the tip of his tongue, I feel it in his voice, trembling like a bassline on an old blues track, consuming my soul and paralyzing me with fear...do you think it's fear? I think it is. The fear of knowing that I feel the exact same way. Damn. Maybe even more. The worse part is that at some point I'll have to tell him, because if I dont, I'm going to combust. What a resposibility, to own someone elses heart. I find myself thinking of him at the oddest times and he always seems to make his way into my dreams. I see us in this wonderful bliss. No, my dreams are not all peaches and cream...I see us running into challenges. But through it all I see us side by side still. He's the epitome of all I've ever wanted in a man. Dammit. I dont like this. The scary part is that I fear he feels it to. Double dammit. I'm walking very slowly through the valley of the shadow of commitment, and I feel him right behind me. If I can just keep at this pace I'll be ok. If I can just keep my mouth shut a little longer. If I cant just keep  him  from saying the L word, I'll be ok.

      I'm pretty ticked. My tired on my car is busted. Great. I found someone to fix it. Great! I went home to get the car and wouldn't you know it, now my car doesnt wanna start! Wont even turn over! All I get is *tick tick tick*....'Tick tick tick'??? What the heck is 'tick tick tick'??? No Mr. Car, you need to 'Vroom Vroom, not 'tick tick tick'! I have shopping to do, places to go, people to see and all you got for me is 'tick tick tick'?!?!?! The devil is a shole 'nuff liar! And I know he was under my hood last night trying to see how he was gonna stop me from getting to Publix to buy my milk. My sister brought me milk so HA! How ya luv that, Lucifer? But yanno, I see it this way...this is just the Lords way of saying 'Jazz, you're ready for the Lexus now. You've been a pretty good girl." When I look at it like that, I can't get too upset. All things work out for the good though. I just wish my car was working for the good of my shopping habit cause the mall is too far to walk!
