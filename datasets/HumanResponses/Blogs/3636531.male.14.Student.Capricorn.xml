      Man, I'm so bored right now... There's nothing else to do but post, even though I only posted a few hours ago. I can't really go biking because I don't know anyone who can do something with me right now.   Earlier today I thought of some pretty cool ideas for a new website/my website. They are both in planning stages. I will change my current website (fusionx2.com), because right now its failing....dismally. I don't think I can make a gfx design community, since there are way too many out there anyways. I was thinking of making a new version, more of a html site for quicker loading. It will have articles, games, fun stuff, and images. More like a personal site again. I'm also making it have to do with fantasy football.  That brings me to my next site idea. I was thinking of making a New England Fantasy football Network. I've been playing fantasy football for about 3 years, and I know a lot about it. I'm pretty obsessed with it, and my family already has a league, thanks to me and my dad (its called the South Shore Retards). The SSR has been around for 2 years now, with the coming season being its second season. I was thinking about getting some people to help me out with the site, giving up-to-date news, player predictions, and sponsoring leagues and publishing stats. Also it would have a forum and everything. This is a little far-fetched, but it might work...I just need some help with it.  Music: I recently found two new favorite bands for me: Anti-Flag and Rise Against. They are both punk bands, and I have a lot of there songs now. If you haven't heard them, than try to, you won't regret it.   Chris    Currently Listening To:  Anti-Flag- Turncoat  Mood:  bored out of my mind

      My life... hmm... where to start. Im a 14 year old kid from Massachusetts. I created this blog to post all my current activities, feelings, and designs. I decided to go with the harbor theme because it reminds me of Maine, where I love to go.  some people have been pressuring me to get a blog *cough*Tiffany*cough*, and actually post meaningful things in it, actively. This time I will stay active in the blog. Ok, enough about this...  Tommorow, I'm leaving for a one week vacation to virginia beach. Im going to miss everyone at IS (Imusion Studios, basically my second home), but they will know I'm having a fun time. I can't wait to get there, I need to get everything off my mind and just have a fun time, thats all I want. And I also get a chance to hang out with my cousins who I don't see very much... this will be the best vacation I have ever taken.   So now I'm supposed to be watching my sister while my mom is at the gym. I've pretty much neglected that but I do check up on her. She just turned 4, but I've taught her to look after herself. When my mom comes home I will probably go biking around the street and the neighborhood, maybe hang out with some friends, and then I will have to pack later...  Well thats about all I have to say for right now.   Chris    Currently Listening To:  The Eagles- Desperado  Current Mood:  content
