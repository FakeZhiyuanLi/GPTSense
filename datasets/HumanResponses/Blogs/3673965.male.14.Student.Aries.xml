      Isn't it a bright morn-afternoon. So bright it woke me up at 1. ^^" Which, works out with me, no problems there. Today I get to level on FFXI~! Nothing better than neverending leveling. I swear, leveling on RO is so much easier. Maybe I just die too much, :: Shrug ::. I'm going to start drawing a filler for a friends webcomic this night if I don't have to travel to San Antonio. Ah, that reminds me. I have to draw character plot sheets for Niou, one of the main characters of, " Namida Kanashimi ".   Ja, ato de~!

      Finally got my blog thing back up. Too bad I couldn't use my old account. ( u u' Keep forgetting the passwords to everything. Tsk tsk tsk. ) Anyhow, time to get a decent post done! Today, I woke up late like usual, except later than usual. So would you call that usual? Erm, yeah. 2:00 PM [ CST ] was my wake up time. I got out of bed by 2:30, and started working. Trying to get with Anime International is going to be harder than I thought, but I'll get to it. I looked at DDR Machines that are on sale on certian sites. Found DDR EXTREME for 5k, nice price for a machine, last time I saw one it was 8k. I also stumbled upon A-Girl, a webcomic ish thing. VERY nice, I like the art style and storyline. ^^" Funny, yes. I've also been practicing on my Japanese, so I'll know more than I should before my fall class, and so I can mabye go to Japan for the holidays. I've drawn a couple pictures and starting on a new art project, " Namida Kanashimi - Teardrop Sorrow ". It'll take me a month or so to get it up, but worth the wait. I'll be changing my drawing style just for this. It'll be a uh, a new one like, a new type of story! I'll be making NK ( Namida Kanashimi )a love story like thing~! For a person who is completely hopeless in the love area, I somehow know how to think up nice stories. Let's see, I'm about to passout so, I might aswell resume my sleep so I don't wake up late again.

      My hyper/happy mood drove off today. Yeah, too bad it didn't stay like I *needed* it too. Now I'm back to my mellow moods and stuff. The smallest things make the biggest changes, somehow. Today, I went rafting. I think. Well, we got a raft and intertube and floated down some river, which I forget it's name. It goes around this waterpark and all, it's nice, slow, smooth, calm. The whole thing took about two hours, to float around. It was fun, I guess. That was about all I did today, nothing else much really. Not feeling like making such a post at the moment. I'll throw the drama at your sorry ass in a few hours. For right now, time to waste some time while I nap. A nap would do me good, maybe help me feel better? :: Shrug :: Bleh, I got news on Nihon Port and Nemui Kosetsu which I'll give you later.   Watakushi wa shunyu o-bukuro.       The Completely Pointless Personality Quiz

       What's on todays menu, hm? Tonight, I'll be discussing the new talk on iRO ( International Ragnarok Online ). For those whom don't know what iRO is, it's the asian MMORPG, that asians are currently addicted too, same with the whole world. If you want more information on iRO, here's the link to the urlLink  offical iRO site .  Onward into our discussion, let's go to the whole 3-1 ordeal~!  3-1, also known as Advanced Job Class 2. 3-1 has been recently released to the public, and won't be coming onto iRO and kRO ( Korean Ragnarok Online ) for a long time. The new classes are : " Lord Knight ", " High Wizard ", " High Priest ", " Snipers ", " Whitesmith ", " Assassin Cross ", " Padalin ", " Stalkers ", " Professor ", " Clown ", " Gypsy ", " Champion ", and " Creator ". What I've read on these new classes, is that they will be a complete bitch to become. Let's use Lord Knight as an example for our table. Novice > Swordsman > Knight > Rebirth Novice > Swordsman > Advanced Knight > Lord Knight. This is the part that got me lost, " Rebirth Novice ". In order to become 3-1, you must become 99/50 as a 2nd class. Once you get to 99/50, you apply for becoming a 3-1 job class. They then turn you back into a novice, and you go back to leveling like becoming a 1st class again, then to 2nd. Once your 2nd yet again, you must get to 99/50 and then, finally! You have now becomed 3-1!  It's all confusing, I'm still working on some charts on how to make proper builds before this comes out for kRO, even. I'll list out some nice links on places you can find some nice information and help on 3-1 class.   urlLink Link 1 ( don't know who created it )    urlLink Link 2 ( Master Fu Xui spreads the information to the iRO community BBS )    urlLink Link 3 ( Pictures of the new job classes from the official kRO Site )

       Haven't posted, due to some unimportant shit. Let's see, what to type, what to type. Guess we can start with the thing I got crawling over me. 腺病質  忍術, what is it? Translate it near correctly, you'll come up with Lymphatic Ninjutsu. What that is, is about everything of mine. One of the very few things I actually will put my complete time, and effort into. It's actual perpose would be what you would call a Portal. I'm using it as the full name of my work. I'm estimating I'm going to have atleast 2 things up on there, by the end of next year. There is one thing, that's been on my nerves more than about anything. It's about Irshad and I. People think we are still going against each other, when we actually don't peak into each others business. Sure, he shows me his site and all, but I'm not worrying about it. I'm far from Irshads work. He's working for fun, I'm working for the rest of my life.  The project line of Lymphatic Ninjutsu ( aka LN ) would be ( for now), Hue, Namida Kanashimi. Hue, is going to be my highschool-college work. It will cover my art, language, and writing classes. Hopefully. I'm also going to do my best into making it into true manga format, for I am aiming to become Manga-ka in the near future. Is it possible? Maybe. Japanese are strick into what is theres. Unlike us Americans, they have something that they own of their own culture. America doesn't have a list of code, history, and work built into itself to be considered American. Sure, we have a lot of things, but not as big as theirs. If a caucasian woman can become Geisha, I could become Manga-ka by having almost any Japanese in my blood.  On the art format. I will try drawing with Japanese style, as in ink. If my Japanese is good enough by then, I will try to write in Kana, instead of English. I'll make a translated version, of course. I've also changed my art style, I used to draw in a sketch-ish way. I've changed my eye style,  my clothing, and my characters attitude. The plotline of Hue will continue changing untill' I am ready to work on it. Don't expect me to put a deadline on such important work, that would be stupid. I work with the wind, and do it with perfection.  For other news, I've had a couple changes on myself. Straightend my hair out, now it's much lighter and comfortable. I've also taken playing the drums into high consideration. I haven't forgotten about the whole DJ thing, I got many years ahead of me to put that into impliment. I've also started Highschool, which is a big move for me. I'm a bit nervous, it's not a problem though.You make friends along the way, I'm sure it will go great. I'm planning on flying to Reno this winter, visiting Jim, Reid, and Rani ( if he clears his act up ). Spend a week over there or something, just to see the snow and remember the good times. Snow, does amazing things.  Ja~
