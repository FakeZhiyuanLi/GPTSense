      THE REASON  i'm not a perfect person, there are many things i wish i didn't do  but i continue learning. i never meant to do those things to you  and so i have to say before i go, that i just want you to know   i've found a reason for me, to change who i used to be  a reason to start over new, and the reason is you   i'm sorry that i hurt, its something i must live with everyday  and all the pain i put you through, i wish that i could take it all away  and be the one who catches your tears, thats why i need you to hear   i'm not a perfect person, i never meant to do those things to you  and so i hate to say before i go, that i just want you to know   i've found a reason for me, to change who i used to be  a reason to start over new, and the reason is you  i've found a reason to show a side of me you didn't know  a reason for all that i do, and that reason is you

      "The best thing about loving and being hurt is that you get to know what true love really is. For as gold is tested in fire, and so will love be perfected in pain."  "You attract people by the qualities you display. You keep them by the qualities you possess."  "Dans l'amour vrai c'est l'ame qui embrasse le corps." Translation: In true love it is the soul that embraces the body.  "There is one pain I often feel, which you will never know. It's caused by the absence of you."                                                               P.S.                                                             sa su2nod nman ung iba...

             Hi to all of you out there! I don't think i have d reason for making this... but i just don't wanna lie to you 100 percently (haha) therefore now i'm saying dat i'm kinda inspired and i kinda know what's my true objective on involving to such a thing like this and i think it's kinda awkward doing this in an awkward time of an awkward day... It's just bcoz of my self-made criteria: 50% for fun and 50% for some sort of things that pushes me to finally show my feelings, experiences, views, etc...         Suddenly I think there should be a side of me who can at last reveal my long time (not so long..hehe) suppressed self... I realized dat i'm already racing near to the next stage of life and that made me think that i should already begin adapting myself into the grown-up ones and avoiding my childish ones... I think this may seem too serious but i realized it's not! It's just the reality... and nobody could escape from this reality. Instead, we should stand firm and face this "reality"...

      "The greatest love story that was ever told, could be me and you, we may just never know."  "Real love isn't blind, It sees, sees everything but loves anyways."  "Sometimes I wonder why I fell in love with you in the first place, and continue to love you after all the pain. And then you smile at me, and I realize why; without you, I can't breath."
