      Does anyone remember the days before the internet? Do any of the past cracking groups ring a bell? INC,THG, Razor (Not the new ones), Fairlight and a few others. Groups came and went and I guess still do to this day. The games and releases have changed, but I think pre-internet it was much more exciting. Novell and the SBA were routinely trying to get on our bulletin boards. Was always fun keeping them at bay.  The Social Engineers from Europe always trading software for hours on some poor shlepps calling card. Dialing up to all the boards to trade.    The group wars between INC and THG. They were always a pisser. INC courier would be uploading the files to The P.I.T.S and The Slavelord would be hacking out the nfo file to say THG released it and we'd be upping the same file to all our boards with THG stomped on it just to bust chops. Fabulous Furlough would clean up their cracks anyway, which 1/2 the time didn't work.     I had a ball!  Pie

      Well, last Friday I do my usual thing and go to the store , buy a pack of cigarettes for $6.50 and go on my way. Now bear in mind, we have already have a no public smoking law here in NYC to the point where you can't even smoke in a Bar or Nightclub anymore. They have the cigarettes taxed up the ass to where you have to pay almost 7.00 a fucking pack! Now to add insult to injury, they have deemed it necessary to make the cigarettes "Self-extinguishing". Im paying friggin 6.50 to have my motherfucking cigarettes go out on me every few goddamn seconds and have the cigarette taste like shit and smell like shit. Not only does the cigarette go out, AND taste like shit...the fucking thing burns from the inside UP! So now I got a damn cigarette thats burning from the inside UP with a big huge hot ash falling on my hand. This is just total Bullshit. Our mayor is looking out for the Insurance companies and the lighter corporations with this shit. Never mind the little guy who choses to smoke , the bar owner or club owner who has lost revenue from smokers, the local grocer who has lost revenue from smokers going to outside sources for cigarettes, the farmers supplying the tobacco, or the american workers working in the factories that produce the cigarettes. This is just bullshit!  Recently pet owners got a nice blow handed to them. No more Barking will be allowed. Well I guess you guys are gonna have a taste of having your preferences stripped from you. I don't feel bad...since the majority of the people that started all this shit were probably PETA card carrying nature freaks anyways. Pretty soon it will be even more restrictions and taxes for you guys next. I hope they set a yearly tax for you next and only allow you to walk your pets at certain hours and then only certain places.      I hope others see how I feel when other peoples opinions are encroached upon you sometime.

      Prior to knowing about this whole NYC cigarette thing, I had fired off a complaint to Phillip Morris in regards to their what I thought at the time were defective cigarettes. On Tuesday evening a Customer service rep called me at home and asked me many questions in regards to my experience with the "New" specially made for NYC cigarette and appologized for any bad experience that I had with them. She was very concerned with the burns I got on my hand and was a very pleasant woman. She explained how these cigarettes were intended only for NY. I am to send her my pack of cigarettes and for compensation a coupon good for a new carton. I do not plan to purchase this carton in NYC thats for sure. I hope that all Smokers in NY begin to order their cigarettes online, out of state or through bootleggers. Its cheaper and we dont have to smoke that new shitty stuff.
