        Just a topic that needs to be covered, I have lost count how many times I have had this conversation with Nic, who incidentally agrees whole heartedly. Lets take a trip down memory lane back to the days when I was young … (cue warped picture fade of me looking thoughtful). 

 So when I was about 16/17 I was well what you would call an alternative person, listening to alternative music and not being a trendy person. Now back then people who were alternative basically were good fun to get along with and accepted people for who they are i.e. It did not mater how you dressed, what music you listened to, it was cool because that was the point! Alternative  people did not want to be judged like the trendy people did and thus were not into judging people by what they wore or listened to. Good times I will tell you.   

 Ok fast forward time….. Zip……. Present day. 

 What has happened ??? Being alternative or being a goth has become trendy, hang on you say, trendy?  That’s right so it does not sound to bad but wait there is more, now alternative people seem to have criteria for people to be their alternative friends, woa hang on …. So I can’t be alternative if I like to listen to dance music as well as say foo fighters or filter? Well I like lots of music including Eminem and various other non exclusively alternative music. To highlight this point I will show two examples, my mate Nic is in an alternative pub with his alternative mates when he happens to mention that he likes Dr Dre to which the response it close to him having said that he murders babies for fun??? WHY? Surely he can listen to what he likes ? Another example, I’m in a chat room the other day one that is for alternative / freak / goth / etc / etc people, so someone joins and gets kicked because his name has DJ in it (DJ_somename) so they kick him because he must like dance music and cant possibly be alternative (That was actualy what they said!).  

 Ok you say what is my point?? 

 My point is that being alternative used to mean being open minded, non judgmental / not judging a book by its cover and liking people because of who they are not how they dress or what they listen to. People you had the best clique of people you actually were how people were supposed to live but now you just as bad as the trendies / townies / chavs that you hate? Can’t you see that you have become what you despise the most, narrow minded self-involved steriotypical group of people.    Well here is a song for you ---- American Hi-Fi – The Art of Loosing.   

Enjoy

        Welcome one and all, the site is active finally, there has been a long hiatus between the first work I did on this new site, this has mainly been due to contract and other commitments I have had. Today I integrated the site into an external blog system namely  urlLink www.blogger.com  this now provides me with greater freedom to post my, thoughts (rants, insults and general musings) plus I don’t have time to build a proper CMS for this site maybe I will do that later (much later far to busy).  

 So what have I been up to ? Well my back is sore due to the snowboarding I did yesterday, it was part of my mate Ali’s stag do, miles of fun but when you fall over it hurts !!.  Plus Saturday was a good opportunity to catch up with Paul and Ali which does not happen very often (The live in Brighton, far away from Margate).  

 Life wise a lot has happened I have now split up with my long term girlfriend Kat about a week ago or so, :( hmmm that was not nice. 

 We live about two and a half hours away from each other and the relationship had been strained over the last few months, I think we both knew what was going to happen and the choices we had to make. Since university finished we have had a massive change in our lives and the realisation that we are now in the real world (well I’m still in denial I pffffft to the real world!) and we have out whole lives ahead of us and we are not sure if the includes each other. So anyway we both decided that we should split up….. Hmmm part of me is very sad about this and part of me is glad basically I will miss the relationship and I will miss her but I wont miss the apathy and the confusion about what is going on.  

 On a side note it still bugs me that after nearly 19 months of a relationship she still had not told her parents about me !. Oh well maybe I’m old-fashioned, or maybe I’m not the kind of person you introduce to your parents? 

 So as a result I’m in a bit of an emotional vacuum kind of letting everything pass me by, I keep on thinking about how it feels to be in a relationship but I just don’t know what I want out of a relationship anymore. Hmmm my complicated brain.  I know that I still love Kat but that it won’t work, so what do I do? Do I look for love elsewhere or do I just sit on my hands. I think I’m in rebound mode so It’s best if I do nothing! 

 I would say more but its very difficult to get out of my head what I want to say.

        Ignore the date and time on this post, it’s a repost due to the fact that I have moved over to a blogger system 
			 
				Its 20:34 and I'm working on the website again, lots more content now I'm reasonably happy with it. It feels like it's at the stage when it can be put live and any other changes can be done on the fly so to speak. Today has been as most days are, relatively uneventfully, the morning was bad…. No very bad. Due to the coffee (overdose?) I took last night to keep working I could not sleep until 3.30 and had a whole host of what appeared to be strange dreams / hallucinations…. Hmmm less caffeine its what's called for (he say sipping a glass of water). As a result of this I felt shitty all morning and did no work hmm which when you have contracts and clients is not a good thing. 
			 
			 
			The afternoon was ok pressed on with C.B.I.S work and made some headway although I'm sure XML will lead me to an early grave (hmm what about the smoking…).  urlLink Nic  found the time out of his busy schedule (of you know sleeping and stuff..) to send me an amusing Bo Selecta meets The Matrix video clip I will post a link to it when I have uploaded this site. 
			 
			 
			Talking of video clips, I stumbled across  urlLink BMW Films , BMW as in the car fame, it turns out that they have a habit of producing quite good movies to sell their cars. Now I don't mean adverts I mean movies with people like Gary Oldman and Clive Owen in them and directed by such people as John Woo.  The movies which are about ten min's long are rather good but do seem to be an expensive way to sell a car?
			 
			 
			Oooo Tune!! My fancy new  urlLink laptop  (come media centre) has just started playing a Weezer song 'Only in Dreams' dam I love that tune…….
			 
			 
			I must get round to going over to Terry's and taking a look at AvP on the XBOX (well my XBOX that he borrowed) just never the time, they need to invent more days in the week seven is just not enough, how about nine, or ten that's a nice round number. Vote Ten Day Week!
			 
			 
			Pfizer's, that's where I am tomorrow, 10am to be precise hopefully meeting and greeting my interviewer for a six month contract. I'm quietly hopefully as I could do with the work and its been years since I last worked there (at the ripe old age of 14 or 15 cant remember it was work experience anyway).

 Well its 22:52 in the evening and I'm still working on the design of this site I have just designed the main text section, thus why I am writing this entry hopefully it will look ok but I'm not sure?. Anyway I am supposed to be driving round to my mate Terry's house, he has just finished work but really..... I'm to tired so I think I will give it a miss... Erk hopefully this layout will work. 
 Just chucking on another paragraph, again more testing, god I'm fucked can hardly keep my eyes open and I did not even get up until lunchtime! What's up with me :( Dam Nic's too poor to go to  urlLink Festival of Dreams  (for you people that don't know that's FaceParty's one year birthday bash in London) really hope Jon-o can come or im stuck going on my own mrrrggg :( Right time for an extra strong coffee if I have any chance of staying awake.

        Just finished playing the  urlLink Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy  demo for the fifth time, dam I like that game quite a change from  urlLink Rise of Nations  which I had been playing constantly for the last few days. Mmm the world is mine….. ahem.. Anyway Academy is great, lots of saber action and them there glorious force powers, graphics look shiny but not much has changed from the other Jedi Knight days. It seems that Academy was another excuse for Lucasarts to start you back from square one with regards to characters, ooo lets put them in a Jedi Academy so they can like have a character who is not really a Jedi….again. Would have been nice to have had a character that had more that just the basic Jedi skills oh well I suppose that would not appeal to Jedi Knight newbie’s. Pahh to Lucasarts for that, ignoring that fact it looks like the game will be a corker, just reminisce and prepare for more of the same as the other Jedi games.   

 On a footnote Home World 2 comes out on the 12 mmmmmmmm space RTS, bang goes my life for a few days.

        Couple of things in this post, firstly the previous post contained a massive rant against alternative people that in hindsight could have been worded better. It was not my intention to class all alternative people as being as discriminative as each other, as always is the minority of people that can give a group a bad name.  So my apologies people, well how did this change of heart happen, well have just started chatting to a chap who runs  urlLink www.organicmetal.co.uk  a fantastic anime / manga art site. Ben is undoubtedly a fantastic artist and hopefully in the not to distant future he will be doing some art for this here site, watch this space :). So anyway was looking round Ben’s site and drop a message in his guest book, he promptly replied and visited my site where he stumbles upon the aforementioned post.  Several e-mail’s later and I must say I did agree what he said, that not all alternatively people are as bad as I made out and he lists some good personal experiences proving that some townies are much much worse.  I won’t list them here as its not my place to.  So to all the Ben’s and other perfectly amicable alternative people out there my apologies. 

 Right secondly, this relates partially to the first part, go and visit  urlLink Ben’s site  god dam you ! He is a fantastic anime / manga artist I can’t stress that enough!! Nice chap as well so go there now and admire his work. Bloody good at flash web design as well puts me to shame :(. Oh well I best stick to programming me thinks. 

 Just some more blurb, PC is back and working again after last weeks fucking nightmare final straw was the bloody thing dropping every fifth frame on Tears of The Sun (good film but annoying when you cant watch it properly) that was the end XP got executed and re-installed. The OS is dead long live the OS. :P.  

 Finally managed to download Time Baby III from Kazaa bitching thing good tune only wish there was there alterative version available that was played in The Crow, not that I’m a particularly big crow fan just like the band.

        Right it has been over a month since I last updated this site, that’s fucking appalling, although there are some extenuating circumstances. Begin long list of excuses….. 

 I have had the biggest totally mind bendingly shitty internet connection for over three weeks which finally resulted in me cancelling my ADSL with Nildram (who are evil) and moving over to a nice 2 Meg ADSL line from Plus.net.  Basically I had been experiencing exceptionally bad upstream speeds typically of the order of

 Blake 
 Hi (quote login and ticket number etc) 
 [N] 
 How can I help? 
 Blake 
 Err yes have an ongoing fault B.T have just checked my line and everything is A-OK so I want to pass the problem back to you so it can get resolved 
 [N] 
 Sorry sir once a line test has passed there is nothing else we can do, the problem is with you equipment. 
 Blake 
 But I told you before I have changed all my equipment (ADSL router, modem, nic’s, filters etc etc etc. I have even used a good know working modem from another [N] customer. 
 [N] 
 No sir the problem is with you equipment, im going to close the ticket. 
 Blake 
 Hang on the problem is not resolved don’t close the ticket. 
 [N] 
 Well there is nothing else that we are prepared to do so I have to close it. 
 Blake 
  Right can I speak to "insert managers name"  
 [N] 
 I will get her to call you "click" they hung up. 
 

 
 "30 Min's later" 
 
 
 [M] 
 Hi can I speak to Blake Drayson 
 Blake 
 Hi 
 [M] 
 This is "insert managers name" I am calling in regards to you resolved ADSL fault 
 Blake 
 Err the fault is not resolved, my upload still does not work. 
 [M] 
 Well the ticket is closed and there is nothing else we are prepared to do, I have been told that the fault it not with your line so it must be your equipment. 
 Blake 
 Repeats all the equipment changes that have been made…… 
 [M] 
 No sorry the fault is with you we consider this problem resolved now. "CLICK" HUNG UP AGAIN. 
 
 
 Well FUCK YOU Nildram. I’m with another ADSL provider now on the same line with the same equipment and it works perfectly. Dam you to hell, my advice don’t go with Nildram unless you fancy pain and suffering. Choose anyone other than them! 

 So anyway I’m with plus net now and they have been fantastic and there web portal is fantastic, providing you all the information you could need. Including my personal favourite you can see how busy their support lines are and how many people are waiting before you ring them! Genius! 

 I will post more about what else has been going on in the life of Blake but for now at least this is an update. Stay tuned sports fans.

I am ill, no fuck that I am phlegm chokingly ill.  Blood hell I never get colds and now I have a bastard of one.  As I don’t have any concentration skills what so ever I have stopped doing my paid work and have decided to update my blog.  So what’s been going on?  A few bits and bobs nothing major.
 
 
Had a mare of a time filling in the RIPE request form so my ISP could assign me an I.P block, that’s finally complete now and I have a nice range of I.P addresses, with that in mind I have been attempting to set up my home LAN with some kind of network structure in mind, its getting there though my fuzzy head is not helping much, I will post a diagram of its layout (minus my IP addresses of course) when I’m done. 
 
 
Splashed out on another DVD burner the other day, bloody Xbox only takes DVD Minus so I brought a cheep one of them toasts discs nicely now. Talking of the Xbox or should I say one of my Xbox’s (the modded one) I have embarked on some interesting mod’s for it. Currently spray painting the jewel so it’s blue and changing the L.E.D’s so that they are blue. On a less cosmetic front I will be modding it so it can run a normal DVD drive as well as the Xbox DVD one, building a proper VGA cable for it and adding two normal USB ports. The overall aim of this is to turn it into a Linux box and a games console, as it already runs Linux quite nicely on a dual boot type setup these mods should make it very usable as a nix box in its own right. I will post pictures when it’s done
 
 
Oh Ez has just e-mailed me (mate from uni) he looks like he is doing well, he works for Lehman Brothers (oh for a full time job, no scratch that I like working from home!) and he just pointed me to his  urlLink website , go take a look its about traditional Shotokan Karate so well worth a look, he is the web admin for the site and a karate instructor so don’t mess !! Take it from me he could kick you ass. Site looks nice, very clean and informative I give it about 7 out of 10 nice one Ez
 
 
Anyway bed calls my head is getting fuzzy again.

Finally moved into my temporary office, well its basically a pre-fab building in the garden that will become a workshop after I have moved back out, however it has power and a network connection so who am I to complain. In reality its quite nice and fits my needs perfectly the only thing it really needs now it a T.V connection and it will be spot on. I have just got back from Staples I had to get a new chair due to the fact that the desk area in this workshop is so high, its designed to be used when you are standing not sitting hence I was doing a midget impersonation every time I tried to use my computer, this is sorted now and I have a lovely tall chair mmm so soft as well. 
 
 
Have managed to move over all the essential electrical equipment that is *necessary* in any modern office, you know computer, laptop, stereo, xbox, vcr, eight speakers, etc etc. Well I *need* all of those things…. Oh yea and a fridge and maybe a coffee machine soon mmmm well I may have no T.V hook-up but I have the xbox with the xbox media centre software so I can watch all of my t.v episodes over the network via it and watch any DVD I fancy so its not all bad.  I will stick some pictures up in the photo gallery today hopefully they will be better than the usual webcam ones I will try to be less lazy than usual and fish out the digital camera. So check out the gallery if you get a chance.

Well another day and another blog entry.  Sorry I was so tired to write last night but hey that’s how it goes at 2am *grin*.  So what has been going on? Well firstly I have changed the plug-in that feeds this website with my iTunes data.  I was using AIMP and Curl to feed the page but this was not exactly an idea way of working it, I have just changed to the excellent  urlLink ‘Now Playing’  plug-in by Brandon Fuller.  This iTunes (Windows) plug-in saves me the hassle of using two programs to do one job and makes life very simple. In addition it automatically looks up the song on Amazon.co.uk for me and attempts to find a related album art picture, it is not always successful but it is a nice feature none the less.  I need to play with the layout of the outputted data so that the presentation is slightly more informative that it is at present but that is just aesthetics. I highly recommend you check this plug-in out if you are thinking of syndicating your iTunes song information, in the near future I will write a guide for linking ‘Blogger’ and this plugin.
 
 
Well that’s the tec stuff out of the way what else have I been up to, well other than work I have been most procuring cheap cigs from my friend who went to Belgium today yay for me, got to love the cheap cigs. I also bumped into a friend of mine today at the local petrol station which was cool, I got to see Lauren’s fantastic bike it’s a cool chopper with a pink or purple frame I can’t remember but it was cool. In addition I have been getting increasingly angry at Initial City Link who are officially the worst courier service in the UK, their inability to perform even the most simple deliveries astounds me. As a result I now have the innards of my new web server but no rack mount case, thanks City Link and Fuck You, you incompetent bastards.

        Ok well I have a few things to write about but I’m very tired been working most of the day and just watched ‘One Hour Photo’ which was a fantastic film also watched ‘Black Hawk Down’ for the first time yesterday but will write more about that later. So just a few things, I’m testing a iTunes plugin to show what I am currently listening to, it uses curl to ftp a java script file up to the server and then the html page picks it up when it refreshed bla de bla etc. No I am to tried. More tomorrow.

Ahh just at the tail end of a lush weekend, for many reasons so let me explain. Firstly I am not one for hot weather, in fact I generally hate it, I don’t think that my body was designed to work in a hot climate and for the most part whenever the temperature goes over about 18 degrees I try and hide from the world in the coldest place I can find! Therefore I put my case that I should be shipped to the Antarctic (with appropriate funds and satellite hook-up not to mention broad band :).
 
 
So this aside Kat came down this weekend for a visit which was cool, and we had a great time, amazingly she managed to drag me (kicking and screaming) down to the beach as we just “had” to enjoy the lovely weather…. Oh and it was lovely about as lovely as sticking me in an oven. Anyway so we go down to the beach, it’s the first time in as long as I can remember that I’m actually wearing shorts this is a bad sign for me and anyone unlucky enough to see my legs :P 
 
 
So we are down there and in all sun creamed up in factor one billion or what ever you have to wear nowadays so your skin does not boil and your innards turn into a cancerous mess, (Actually it was probably factor 25 I don’t know I’m a guy…) and the funny thing I actually enjoyed it, it was kind of relaxing once you get past the point of thinking your about to catch fire.  So looks like it was Beach 1 Blake 0. I did not get sunburnt I did not hate it, and I got to laugh at lots of stupid people getting burnt or having to deal with really annoying children ha ha ha!  Talking of annoying children, there was so many of them that it just reinforced my view of never having my own so bonus! (Anyway I am sure there is some obscure law somewhere that says I can’t procreate, something about polluting the gene pool). 
 
 
Though I have to say one of the best things that happened this weekend was I GOT A DIGI CAM! YAY, no more relying on the old’s digi cam(s). Mmmm its so shiny to, and it was a mini revenge on going to the beach I got to drag Kat around electrical stores I ridiculous heat so I could decide on the one I wanted *evil grin*.  
 
 
So here are the details of this momentous purchase: It’s a Sony DSC-P72 Camera, Its 3.2 Mega pixel, with a 3x Optical Zoom and (up to) 3x Digital Zoom. Also, its mine and its lush, I would write more but just go   urlLink here  and read the review.
