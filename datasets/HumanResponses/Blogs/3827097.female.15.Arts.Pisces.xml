       Current Music:  Could It Be Magic - Donna Summer  Feeling:  blah  Ok, I'm late. Yeah and posting here since diaries.suchisthis, it's server, is being a bitch. Vicky and I headed to Kristen's house in the Bronx for a bbq. She lived far out but it didn't matter b/c we spent the night and it was worth it. Vicky and I ate a lot of chicken and hot dogs. But we  killed  the donuts. It was great but very  fullfilling , lol. Then soon as the hours went by we all went outside. Kristen's neighbors were lighting up fireworks in the middle of the street. It was cool and pretty at first but then it started to swift it's position. It went in the air but then as it went down it looked like it was going to hit us. I screamed my ass off and ran around the corner. There were many coming one after another. I think they did that on purpose just to enjoy our screaming of being terrorized. Kristen was just having a blast laughing at us. She was just standing there like it was no tomorrow. Hmm...let her ass get burned, lol, I'll be down the block. Later that night we had a ritual. A burning ritual. Lol. Vicky and Kristen were burning everything from plastic cups to pop rocks. Haha. It was great. I think Kristen has a slight fetish for hot wax. She kept pouring it on her from the candles outside. I was like what is wrong with you?? Do you know how hot that is? She was like it really doesn't burn. It feels so good. You should try it. -Pours-. *Lets out ahh.* :-/. I really worry about her. Then I was feeling a little darish and told them to flash the air. They only showed thier bras. Pussies I said. They were like well u haven't done anything yet, let me see you do it. So I did. I flashed the air with my feminine parts formely known as breast. =D. Then after burning half of the cups and ruining the poor cement we headed inside for the night. I was the 1st to take a shower. Then as soon as I get out Kris and Vicky both come in the bathroom and go in the shower...together...with thier clothes on. I'm like what in the world. They're like Sharice come in with us. It's gonna be fun so I get in, only I'm already washed and half a little towel on me. It was getting soaked so you know what I said fuck it and took it off. I was completely naked. It was great. Then they started washing thier hair. Vicky washed Kristen's and I washed Vicky's. Ahh those are the hightlights of the night. I had fun. It was the best 4th of July I ever had...yet. I'm out. Peace.    You are the Moon card. Entering the Moon we enter the intuitive and psychic realms. This is the stuff dreams are made on. And like dreams the imagery we find here may inspire us or torment us. Understanding the moon requires looking within. Our own bodily rhythms are echoed in this luminary that circles the earth every month and reflects the sun in its progress. Listening to those rhythms may produce visions and lead you towards insight. The Moon is a force that has legends attached to it. It carries with it both romance and insanity. Moonlight reveals itself as an illusion and it is only those willing to work with the force of dreams that are able to withstand this reflective light.

      Hey. This one of the many things I have as an expression zone. I hope to update in this as much as possible. No one at all knows this blog I have. Hopefully it shall remain that way. Sorry for my rudeness. My name's Sharice but ppls call me Cherry.   What's On My Mind  Alex. Alex. Alex. I want him so badly right now and I can't have him. Uhh it sucks! I wanna reach out to him so badly the way I wanna do it but can't b/c he has a girlfriend and I can't do that. -Sighs-. Oh Alex, come back to me. I can make you so happy. I know he loves me (b/c he said it) and I love him. I'd do anything for him. Anything for him to be content.
