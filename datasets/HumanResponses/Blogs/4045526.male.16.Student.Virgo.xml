       Ok then, onto my second post. Today was an awesome day! well, not really, lol. some cool things really did happen though. omg, at work today (at our local grocery store) and old lady cussed out a van. it was halarious man! i put her groceries in the back and then she hit her back on the van and just let loose, heres what i remember.  ME: ok, there ya go. have a nice day.      OLD LADY: thank you.  oof  ow! stupid mother fuckin van! son of a bitch! bastard! shithead! asshole who parked to close, ima kill you! bitch! FUCK!  omg it was soo funny. and she was the really small old lady with a big bald spot and grey hair. that was the highlight of my day. well, back to the rest of the day. right when i got home i was pleasantly suprised to find that my dad had bought a new cd player for the car im gonna get in a month. (who knows if it'll still be there when i get it) i also got 3 of the new cd's i ordered a few days ago. (ill nino, thousand foot krutch, and earshot) i was told not to expect em until aug 3-14 so that was a major plus. i also restarted playin FFXI today after a 5 month hiatus. i forgot how awesome a game it is! uh yea, i gotta go do some other shit so thats all i'm postin today. talk to myslef later, Jake

          hey ya'll! this is Jake, and i hope this is my first of many postings. i guess i'll just talk about my day and bitch a lot...&nbsp; gee that probobly  never  happens on blogs :)&nbsp; ok then, back to my day, i used my new debit card to buy a buncha new cd's off of amazon.com. lets see, i got phenomenon by thousand foot krutch, alien youth by skillet,&nbsp;smash by offspring, two by earshot, and (i forgot the cd's name) by ill nino.&nbsp; shoot, i just heard of ill nino today, but&nbsp;the song i heard from them was awesome: this times for real.&nbsp; if anyone is actually readin this then download that song (leagally of course!) cause its freakin awesome. lets see... its still too early to talk about my religous views (they're really screwed up according to&nbsp;anyone who i talk to) but telling you&nbsp;that i mowed 4 lawns today would just be boring... so lets see, wahts in between, hmm.. recently i have fallen headfirst into the wonderful world of sprite comics.&nbsp; i stayed up for 3 days straight reading all of 8bit theater, bobandgeorge, life of wily, and squidi.&nbsp; they are all very halarious and if u havent then u should read them. i guess thats somewhere in between freaky religous beliefs and boring stuff i did today. meh, oh well thats about it for today, tomorrow i'll be back with some actual bitching, today was a bitch-free-day (ur lucky) so i'll talk to myself later, bye&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JAKE &nbsp;
