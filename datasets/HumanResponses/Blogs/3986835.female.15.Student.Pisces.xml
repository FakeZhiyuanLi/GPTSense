        Well...today sucked. I hate the school. I hate the people. I hate this stupid town. I wanna go back home. I'm so pissed off. And to top it off, I read Sergio's blog today. It made me feel so bad. I really just...I dunno what I want anymore. There's almost no point in going back out with him. I mean, the only thing that we would do is sit around telling each other about how much we wanna be with each other. And we practically still do that anyway. We were IMing the other day, and when he had to go, we told each other we loved each other. Which made me...overly happy. Mostly because he isn't holding a grudge, but also because...he still loves me! And I still love him. And, I mean, do we necessarily HAVE to be going out to tell each other we love each other? I mean, it might be a problem if I ever end up going out with a guy here. But that's okay. I don't need anyone else. Because I have someone who holds my heart, and that's all I need. Wow, that was really corny. I don't care. I'm freakin' stressin' because every girl, I swear, at this damn school gives me horrible looks. And I know why: because they're all hoochies, and I DON'T dress like a skank. I'm an outcast because I choose not to conform to their skankish ways. That's okay. If I get my way, I won't be going to this school for long. I'm gonna ask my mom if I can go to the same school as Sherika. Just cuz I get along with people from her school really easy. Trust me, I've met some of them. And at least I won't have to eat lunch by myself there, like I did today. It was pretty damn pathetic. I felt bad for myself. Anyway, I'm really having a bad day. There's so much crap going on that I don't even wanna talk about. But I'm trying really hard not to reach for the razor blade. Really really hard.

        Lalala...this sucks. I start school tomorrow! Nooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But I'm ready. I'm ready for anything this school throws my way. Homework:ready. Hard-ass teachers:ready. Horrible cafeteria food (because the nearest damn McDonald's is, like, a million miles away...):uh...ready...?, bitchy girls mad-doggin' me: so ready! More stupid guys (more than El Paso):ready. Being the best lookin' chick at this school: damn ready! Okay, no, not really. But I'm ready for everything else. I think that the only good thing about starting a new school is that you basically get to start all over. So no one here knows anything about all the damn Richard rumors, therefore no one thinks I'm a slut. And no one knows exactly how I am, so I could act like a total "Plastic" as Amy would say, or I could just be really mean, or I could be really nice. It's like, I could choose my personality and if I play it off well, I could get away with it. But I think I'll just stick to myself. Shy but friendly but honest but flirty but slightly stuck-up but overall just me. Because I would do a horrible job trying to be anyone else. My acting skills suck. That's why I'm takin' Drama, baby! I've always been told I was a drama-queen, so, I figured hey, why not? Right along with Spanish 2 (again! grr...), Algebra 2/Trigonometry, English 2, World History, Anatomy, and ROTC twice, both semesters. Pretty boring schedule, I know. But, I do wanna graduate with pretty high honors, and so that's how I'm supposed to do so...well, without Drama...I had to take a fun class! OKay, so I'm gonna go figure out what I'm wearing tomorrow.

        Okay, I've finally got it. I know exactly how to explain to Sergio what the hell my problem is...I'll tell him the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I'll tell him all about Xavier and how he asked me out and I wasn't interested but I told him I'd think about it that one night we went bowling, and how I walked him to his door when we dropped him off and he kissed me (yes, he kissed me. No, I didn't kiss him back. He caught me off guard.) and how I went home and cried and bawled because I felt so horrible for even letting that happen and I knew how he would have taken it. He would've taken it like any boyfriend. He would've freaked out. And everyone that I've told said that as long as I didn't do anything wrong but...somehow I've developed a conscience between last week and yesterday and I feel...horrible.

        Well, my mom got married today. She's really happy and cheery and stuff and said that today she was going to forget anything was wrong with me. But she's become really overprotective. I mean REALLY overprotective. We were leaving the courthouse today, and she felt the need to hold my hand across the street. And while we were sitting in the office, she made me sit on her lap. You don't know how embarassing that was. But I figured if she was going to treat me like a child, I was gonna act like one. So I had to get in the back seat for something while we were picking up "her husband" from work, so I just crawled over the seat. She got pissed cuz we were in her new car. But it was funny. We're gonna go out to eat today at Red Lobster to celebrate the "wedding". I really don't wanna go, but I might as well not fight it because she'll just smack me for throwing a temper-tantrum, then buckle me up in my car seat and stick a bottle in my mouth to shut me up. I had a really bad dream last night. I was lying on the floor of a bathroom and I was bleeding horribly from my wrists. I couldn't stop bleeding, and it was scaring me. Then I looked up, and who would be standing in the doorway? Sergio, of course. And he gave me this horrible look, but he wasn't looking at me, he was kinda looking past me. So I turn to find out what he's looking at, and it turns out he's looking at my almost-dead body on the bathroom floor. That's when I realized that I was pretty much a ghost-type thing. And it was&nbsp;so sad because he breaks down crying, and I can't help but do the same because...well just because I'm causing him all of this pain but there's nothing I can do about it now because it's just too late. And I cry even harder when I try to hug him and hold him and I can't. I dunno what happened after that, but I woke up sobbing. After four hours of sleep might I add. And I didn't go back to sleep after that. I couldn't I was just too scared. What if I'm like, predicting the future or something?

         It's always seemed as if this...       Could last forever, but everything has an end.       And it still feels like this is just beginning       But it's already time to let go          &nbsp;    Chorus: And I can feel the tingling as I break down       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's time to say good-bye       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we always will remember       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And forever we will last       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the dust has blown away       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there's a new beginning       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the world will start a new....it starts with you       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It starts with you          &nbsp;    I once told you that I would always be there       But now I have to let go       I've had nothing to say or do except to       Sing this song for you          &nbsp;    Chorus          &nbsp;    Now it's time to leave but it's never over       No matter what befalls       And we'll outlast all that we've come to know       And we'll understand good-bye          &nbsp;    And forever we will last       Until the dust has blown away       And there's a new beginning and the world will start a new       It starts with you, it starts with you       It starts with you, it starts with you        &nbsp;   Yeah, that's one of the many songs our "Band Leader" Eric wrote. But this one's my favorite.

        I did something so stupid today. I broke up with Sergio. The one person that I was truly in love with. And why? I couldn't even explain to him why! Why? Because...mostly because I'm an idiot, but also because I'm so depressed right now, I don't even know what to do with myself. And I thought that breaking up with him would...ease some of the stress I'm feeling right now. I mean, the fact that I'm his girlfriend sitting here wanting to commit suicide...that must be hurting him on the inside. On top of that, I won't be home very much to talk to him or anything because my&nbsp;mother's suspecting that something's wrong, so she's been playing "shrink", and if I don't tell her what's going on soon, she's gonna take me to a real one. Which is scary. But, um, yeah, and I just feel like I'm a horrible girlfriend.&nbsp;But I couldn't put him through it. I told him that I didn't wanna break up, but "separate". But I'm wondering if he'll see it as a break-up. I didn't mean for it to sound like that. I'm such a frikin' idiot. But for once I've done what everyone has always told me to do: "follow your heart". So why do I feel like crap?     On top of that, I don't deserve him. I mean, he's so perfect and I'm just...a bitch. I suck as a girlfriend. He deserves so much better than me, and I hope he finds someone out there for him.

        Hello hello. Sorry I didn't make an entry yesterday. It was quite a busy day. I went to my eye exam, and the doctor pretty much told me I was blind. He was only half-joking. But I'm very near-sighted, so I had to get glasses (which is something I already knew, but my old ones were broken). So my mom and I went to the mall and I picked out these cute frames and gave them my perscription, and I had to pick up my glasses at 5:00. It was only 2:45, so my mom and I drove to a small town outside of Huntsville to look for new curtains for our living room and wedding rings. They're supposed to get married today but...we'll see. They're going J.O.P., so they can just wake up one morning and say, "Let's get married today!" That's the beauty of that. She brought up a very good point though. Any time anyone in our family has a big wedding, they end up getting divorced. It's our family curse. Okay, so anyway, we were shopping for rings and I was looking at guitars when Arnold calls and says that Ty, my sister, has a fever of 102.3 or something. So he picked her up from daycare and we met him at the hospital. After that, we went grocery shopping, and my mommy bought me doughnuts cuz she starved me all day. We came home, I helped her cook, I cleaned by bathroom, showered, ate, helped clean the kitchen, got on the internet, e-mailed Steve, IMed Lauren and Shawn, e-mailed Sergio, then I went to bed. And I actually slept four hours straight for a change! I didn't go back to sleep after that, but I've never slept four hours straight without waking up or anything, so I was pretty tired. Then my mom decided she was gonna let me sleep in, so she didn't force me to go back to the hospital with her. So I slept some more, and then Xavier called me at 9:00 am. I didn't answer the phone because there was no point. When we're on the phone, he talks to everyone around him but me. And, I'm sorry, but that's just a waste of freakin' phone minutes. My mom says it's cuz he's nervous, but I really don't care. Don't call me unless you have something to say to ME. Do I come off as bitchy and conceited? Cuz I hear it from people all the time, but I've never noticed it until I read what I think (if that makes any sense...). I don't mean to. Well, I'm gonna go shower and get dressed. And MAYBE call Xavier back. Maybe. I'll probably type later.       &nbsp;   Song of the Moment-"She Will Be Loved"-Maroon5     Why?- I dunno, just cuz &nbsp;Maroon5 is an awsome band&nbsp;and I love all of their songs.

        Hello again. Well, it's been an interesting day. I stopped myself from crying anymore. My mommy came home, then she dropped me off at Sherika's, where I met the rest of the band. Well, there were only two other people that I hadn't met...but anyway, yeah. There's Brandon, the bassist, and Eric, the other guitarist, other than Sherika. They're pretty cool, and apparently Brandon likes me. But he's 18 and...disgusting. I mean, aside from what Sherika's told me (he's a perve, he's immature, he thinks the world revolves around him, he's rude and disrespectful, etc.), I've formed my own opinion about him. He's a total perve who tries too hard. Eric's cool though. He's very funny and, according to Sherika, very patient. But, he does have to put up with Brandon, so it's understandable. He's also, like, a freakin' genius. He's skipped two grade levels in the past, and so he's already graduated. He just turned 16 this year. I was like, "Alright! Someone to help me with my Algebra 2 homework!" And my other adoring fan Xavier didn't show up to practice today. Aw...too bad! I was really looking forward to him sitting there making gaga faces at me for two hours again. Hm...now all I have to do is get Eric to like me and I'll have the whole band in the palm of my hand, Mwahahahaha!!!!!! Okay, so, this day turned out well after all, I guess. But I'm gonna go to bed now. I have an eye exam at 11:20 tomorrow, and I'm hoping I'll wake up in time. Summer vaction is making me lazy...       &nbsp;   Song of the Moment-"Forever We Will Last"- Illegal Operation (Our Band!)     Why?- Because it's just such a beautiful song. I'll type up the lyrics one day maybe. I have to learn it for my "audition" in which I'm competing with...no one else. I hope I make it!

        So, I woke up this morning really really mad and stressed out and, just...hateful. But, I've never been one to purposefully take my anger out on other people. I'd rather take it out on myself. So, because of the argument that I had with my future step-dad, and the fact that no one in this stupid house listens to me, and the fact that I woke up a million and one times last night because of my sister AND her father, and the fact that I just hate living in this stupid crap-hole of a town we like to call Huntsville, and the fact that I really have no one to talk to because my mom's either at work or sleeping, and all my friends are back in El Paso, and I didn't feel like e-mailing anyone and having to wait until it was convenient for them to recieve a reply...I had a nervous break-down and did what I promised myself&nbsp; and others I wasn't going to do anymore. Well, first I cried for about an hour, then I went into the bathroom, grabbed a razor, and made four pretty deep gashes on my right wrist. Then, that wasn't enough, but I can only use so much of my wrist because my wrist band only covers so much, so I got daring and cut my inner left ankle six times. I mean, I feel a little better now...but not much. I cannot stop crying, and I don't even know why I'm crying, and it's killing me, because I really want to stop cutting myself, but I've developed some kind of...addiction, I guess. I dunno what to do, but I'm not going to tell anyone. Not anyone here anyway because there's no one to tell. And even if there was, I know exactly how my mother would react. She'd freak out and yell at me and lecture me until the freakin' cows came home. So, anyone that's reading this is either back in El Paso and can't do anything for me anyway, or just doesn't know me at all. And I'd like to leave it at that. And just because I have time, I'll explain to those two people who knew that I cut before everyone else, and wanted to know why. Long story, but you asked for it. It was right after I broke up with a certain boyfriend last year (freshman year). He was, I figure the first guy I'd ever loved, or he wouldn't have driven me to do what I did. Anyway, so I suffered from what I like to call "Post Break-Up Syndrome". And basically, it just lasted longer than it ever did with any of my other boyfriends because I fell quite hard for this guy, and while we were dating, we went through a lot of crap together. So, that put me in a sort of depression. But when we broke up, that's when it hit me hard. And so I thought that, you know, cutting myself would make me feel better, and the physical pain would take away from the emotional pain. And it did. And if it didn't, well then I just didn't notice. So then, after that, I went through a lot because living with my aunt became a lot harder because she was getting on my nerves, and I was getting on hers, and she was just really rude to me at times. So then, while living with her, I think I cut myself two or three more times before I got kicked out of her house and went to live with my grandma. There, I argued with my grandma a lot about coming home on time because I never wanted to be there. Then one day, she made a comment about how she'd be happy when I was gone, and that got to me. So, I had a mental break down and thought that no one wanted me around. That's when I thought that I'd just be better off dead, because no one wanted me around anyway. So I cut myself pretty bad that night. But the only thing stopping me was the thought that I was really gonna hurt the three most important people in my life: My mom, by best friend Lauren, and My b/f Sergio. Because I knew for a fact that they cared about me a lot, so I couldn't stand to hurt them. So there, there is my story. Now don't ask me again why I do it, okay?       &nbsp;   Song of the moment- "Crawling" By Linkin Park     Why?-Because that is exactly how I feel right now.

        Okie dokie, hehe, this is cool. I've decided I will create a "blog" as well, just cuz, ya know, I have nothing better to do but express my thoughts to anyone who will listen (And thanks for the idea. You know who you are). My thoughts as of this very moment: I really wanna go back home. I miss El Paso somethin' awful (as the Alabamans would say). I miss all my best friends, I miss my beau (or boyfriend, for those of you who are easily confused), I miss the crappy weather, I miss Chico's, I miss all of the ROTC drama. And Alabama just plain sucks. I've almost died twice due to tornados. And the people are so freakin' nice here, it's scary. and a life-long friend since 2nd grade has changed...completely. She's just very...ify. Like, I dunno, sometimes she just acts like she doesn't know what she wants. Other times, she's really overdramatic. Then there's my mom. We're actually getting along, and that's scary as well. We've NEVER gotten along, but now, we're shopping together! How scary is that? And as for my soon-to-be step-dad...well, I've never gotten along with him, and I don't intend to. He's weird, and nerdy, and a know-it-all. Plus, sometimes he tries to act like my dad, when in actuality, he's nowhere close. I've lived without a dad for more than 15 years, so just because he's the father of my sister doesn't give him the right to just move in and take over. And I thought it was really funny how, one day, while shopping for furniture for our new house, my mom just comes out with this: "So, what would you think of Arnold and I getting married?" Well, I didn't wanna ruin a good thing, so to avoid an argument, I just said "I don't care." "What do you mean you don't care?" she asked. "Just that, I don't care. Whether you get married or not, it really doesn't matter. You guys are practically married anyway, so the only difference will be a ring on your finger." Ha! I love it when I get the last word! I mean, I didn't mean to be such a smart-a$$, but, hey, that's just how it's gotta go.     So any-who, I must get going. I have such a full day tomorrow (puh-leeze). So look forward to the next post, coming to a theater near you!        &nbsp;    Song of the Moment- "Pieces of Me"-Ashlee Simpson      Why?- It's a secret
