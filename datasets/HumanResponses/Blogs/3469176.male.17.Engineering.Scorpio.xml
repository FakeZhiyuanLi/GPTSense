						    4:50pm 5.30.04   tis time again... tis time for me to replenish my strength in the sanctuary... tis moment where singing songs of love and adoration and "searching" and worshiping one's Pillar of Strength will rejuvnise first your spirit then your soul then the flesh... im beginning to realize once again that i am nothing if i am not attached to the Vine. Beginning to realize my mistakes... beginning to realize that success is not in my hands. I am not even in MY hands.  time of refreshing is at hand ...

						    8:36pm 5/28   I believe in the plans that He has for me. He is my inspiration. My Rock and my Salvation. He is everything. But though His promises are in your hands, why do you keep walking in the counsel of the ungodly? You wretched soul... ask for forgivness so that you might become acceptable in His Presence...Pray that you might not be tempted.

						   10:58am 6.13.04  ok... here i am again... why is it so hard to tread the path of the righteouss? i ask even though i know the answer... its really wierd to know the Truth and yet still go against it, at times maybe deny it even. its hard to do things now because of the present situation... trials and tribulations are aplenty.   School has been great, generous even. by saying so, i mean that the Professors are not that sadistic anymore...or maybe its just me. i dont know...   relationships are going stronger... now i can see those that are true from the those that are merely acquaintances... the genuine from the "japex"! sapphires from the.... rubies??? i dont know... both are precious but , its not really a matter of importance or value... but a matter of those I chose that will be more valuable to me...or "usefull"(hmm)... valuable...usefull... i think both are basis in choosing friends... but the first more than the latter, ofcourse.  i REALLY NEED to rub myself off this wap thingy... its taking over my whole life!!!! i dont know what to do.... But God is soooo Good.... he answered me... my prayers... He spoke to me thru Ptr.Jo last sunday....i have to go back to the heart of Worship(like the song).... Its really not that easy....by yourself...once again...Grace is all i need...and the Source of Grace ofcourse....   He is God Almighty, so we dont have to be."

						   11:00am 06.03.04   Isaiah 9:6   There is a profound truth at work in the life of every Christian.  Regardless of your situation you have hope and deliverance because you have  Jesus. You have a wonderful, eternal, Father who is able to advise you.  Guidance, direction, healing and counselling are all found in his  words. He gives peace to all who will trust in his abosolute ability to work  all things for good. He carries the burdens of all who will allow him  to do so.   He is God almighty, so you don't have to be.   No matter where  you find yourself today, as long as you have Christ you have something  to smile about.

       19:44 7/8/04      the past few weeks were a total emotional roller coaster ride... since she was admitted to the hospital, the mood around me seemed to fluctuate like i was in a...or was it me that changed... i still dont know...aahh, sumthing to ponder later while i lie myself to deep slumber.i have sumthing to share, since i didnt find my physical "listener" yet, i resort to bloggin' it   here it goes....    i have a sister. born as patrisha anne(my fave name), on the 26th of january '95. she is my parents' only daughter. shen is a beauty to behold. sum people told me that i look just like her. even though she was still little, you can already see that she will be beautiful when she grows up...   she was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 1 y/o. that time was kindof historic for my family since both sides, my mother's and my father's, didnt have a history of cancer or sumthing... she went thru chemotherapy for a couple of years...at that time i can still remember my mom, looking for a head gear, sort of a bonnet(?), for trisha to wear bcoz she lost all her hair due to the chemicals from the therapy... before she was even 5 y/o, she already had 4 operations...you could just imagine....the nurses can no longer see the veins where the I.V. would be placed bcoz all the veins in her arms are already, what the doctors would call, already crushed bcoz of injections that the hospital people should give her.....   june 27, 10 days after my dad's birthday, 4 more days till my mom's bday,it was a sunny sunday afternoon, trisha was in the hospital bcoz of a heart attack she hadd a few weeks back. she had heart failure bcoz of the chemotherapy, she also had a kidney failure as a reaction to one of her heart medications....   it was june 27, it was a sunday, i woke up late bcoz saturday night,i went out with my barkada, twas Cha's bday at gilligans,coffee at antipolo, strolling along roxas blvd... i got home approximately 6am june 27....woke up late....i got a call from sum1 whose voice i didnt recognize, because "she" was crying and shouting something at the same time....i was like wtf!!?? i yelled back asking her who she was...? but all i understood was,"Your sister, trisha.... she's dead....(mumbling, didnt understand)...." i was dumb struck!! i felt like sumthing with cold fingers touched the back of my neck, it was a moment i cant forget, with the voice, and everything......   july 2 came. i had a sister and she was everything for my parents.... my parents came home, their eyes&nbsp;seem to say that everything is ok.....  but it was not.  i had a sister and she was my parents' only daughter, flower among the thorns  ika nga.  she passed away last june 27,2004. it has been 3 weeks now since the burial... we all know that she is now in heaven... and knowing this is enough for me.  God is good. that is a known fact. He didnt fail to give us the comfort thru friends and other relatives.... and i believe with all my heart that i will see her again one day.... a day that i too will be in heaven.   "He is God Almighty, so we dont have to be..."
