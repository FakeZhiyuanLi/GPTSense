      I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge a man named GilbEY. He asked that I write something nice about him so here goes...Gilbey you have very clean balls and obviously take great care in cleaning them. You have showed them to many people at the fatty parties and we are all blessed. God bless you Gilbey and I look forward to smoking with you in the near future..

      Yes, work sucks and the pay is minimal. After I pay my bills and go Christmas Shopping I will have next to nothing. The sex toy party should be fun tomorrow. Amanda is picking us up at 6pm if that works for you. I talked to Laura and she has a cold so she may or may not go. Later.

      Ahhhhh...The workweek begins once again.... Although it seems like my workweek never ends... At least I have a lighter schedule this week. I probably only have to work 50 hrs rather than the 70 hrs that I worked last week. I guess I'll have to spend my free time Christmas shopping...who knows maybe I'll even have time to squeeze in a night out!

I have to do little bits at a time...then switch to another task. I am rambling aren't I? Would I be a retarded if I said I wish I was working right now? Until next time...

      Wow what a party I was drunk and passed out by 9:30pm. I puked from 11pm-3am. I thought I was going to die and prayed that if I got through it I would never drink again. I dont know how I puked so much. On a good note, my stomach doesnt seem as fat today. I then got up and cleaned the messy house. I now feel ok just a little tired.

      I would have to say that Aimee and I look pretty damb cute in our hats! We are both very independent self sufficient women. I think most of the time it feels like we are single as we leave our boyfriends at home when the girls go out, yet get regular sex. What do you say Aimee do we have the best of both worlds?

      Sitting at home...working on Joe and Yvonnes wedding invite...I love photoshop. The only problem is that I spend way too much time using it. For the past two nights I have come home from work and gone straight to the computer. I don't stop until I have to go to bed. So that is at least 5 hours without looking away from the screen...you can imagine how sore my eyes are after being on the computer for 8 hours at work...then coming home to stare at my computer for another 5. I guess I am a sucker for punishment. Did I mention that I LOVE PHOTOSHOP!  **oh yeah the invite looks really great...I must say I am doing a beautiful job!**

      Saturday morning clean up time. I went to bed early just so i could get up and clean. For some reason I am in the mood to organize things lately...but I have so much stuff that it will probably take me a couple of weeks to get it all done. The hardest part is that Pete keeps the most useless crap and he never wants to throw anything away. He has a habit of taking electronics apart with the intention of using those parts for some great inventions...but they always end up in our many junk containers. Lately I have been reading about enlightened home design and one of the number one things to avoid is clutter...I guess the book is having an effect on me. Well, it's time to start cleaning!

      Ahhhhhhh.....Monday morning, I sure is cold out there. I just got into work. I got up early this morning...so I posted my pic for this week. I don't have a favourite shirt...but I do have a favourite undershirt. So that is what I posted. It is actually a bustier...surprisingly it is very comfortable...a great alternative to wearing a bra.

      So did you get nice and hammered last night Rosie? I guess you guys left before I got home. Work was busier than I thought it would be (last minute reservations). I didn't get home until 10pm, then I just did some reading and went to bed. Am I a party animal or what???

      Well looks as if the plan is to go to Salainte tonight. oh boy. Mike originally says he does not want to come out, but with the thought of me getting drunk and stupid like last time he decides to come out. he says I need to make myself look ugly because I look to good.

      So I went to the mandarin last night...I ate so much that even my back hurt. I think that is the new signal for me to stop eating. When I was at my company party last weekend the same thing happened. Its never happened before. Maybe since I have lost weight there is no room left in my stomach so the food starts trying to fill into other available spaces in my body, hence the back pain. or Maybe I am just rambling on and on to waste time before I have to go to work. Oh yeah I checked out the movie theatres and the only one that is playing monster is in Toronto...oh well...Pete said he'll get it for me anyway.

      I figure I should post something...its been a while.... Hmmm.....lets see....I posted pacman as my favourite toy. Its the best game ever!! I have only been playing it since I was 10 years old...and I still can't beat it. I should try it with game genie...but I think that would take all the fun out of it. I would just like to know if the levels ever change...is it always the same board just with faster speeds as you pass through the levels? Is there any other way to get extra life other than at 10,000 pts. I ponder these questions every time I play... There must be a way to win! I'll win the trophy someday........  Oh yeah, I'm going to the Mandarin tonight...I love buffets!

He was found running around in traffic at concession and east 38 and so far no one has reported him misssing. So we will see....

      Its thursday night and instead  of spending the night watching Survivor, I worked late...then I had to find a shirt for Pete to wear to his grad tomorrow....yay...fun! I can't wait until March 1st...February has been too stressful!!! There are a lot of changes happening at the end of the month. Pete will be a new grad...so its time for him to get a job. I have only imagined what it would be like having two incomes since the beginning of our relationship. I will be starting out with Ralph's new company "Print Solutions". Yvonne & Joe will be married...still sounds a little weird to me...and I cut off about 7 inches of my hair. That's enough writing for today.

      I completed the test you forwarded to me. I dont know why but I cant realte the colour red to Mike Is that bad for our relationship????I choose you as green because it is my  favourite colour and to me it symbolizes consistancy and a sense of calm, makes sense???? I orginally picked orange for Mike because of his hair and the way he looks good in orange which not many can pull off. My mom was white because she is pure which made sense. The rest of it was kind of self explainitory blah blah.

I never really payed attention to what feet look like before...now that I'm actually looking at them they are kinda funny looking. I don't know how anyone could have a foot fetish...For all we know we could be turning someone on right now. Now my feet feel violated!

      This weather sucks! It's so depressing. I feel like I just want to go home and crawl into bed. I hope I get some energy for work tonight. There isn't really much for me to do around work today...except archiving... The person who used to have my job made such a mess of all the files over two years that I am not sure how I find anything. Being the organized person that I am I will fix up all this messiness. It might take me a couple of weeks...but I'll do it!!!

I wish I could have gone to the party and bought some fun stuff...but I guess its better to make money than spend it! I'm probably going to Joe's tonight. He needs me to hook up the computer and internet.

      Hey Aimee how was last night. The Fantasia party was awesome and I got my products up front. I got an attachment to go with the silver bullett and some strawberry lube that is also edible mmm. Amanda got a silver bullett that came with the attachement that I bought and in a nice bag. I am definately going to host a party in the near future, with some girls from work and you, amanda. You can invite your mom and Beckie as well. Anyway mike just notified me that on friday his mom and dad and holly and cassidy are coming for dinner then we are going to michelles to party even though mike has given up drinking. So this means I have to tidy up the messy house. Is still have to buy some curtins for the windows. Later

      Just a note to clarify for the fans out there (McFatty, Gilbey, Jessica(Aimee friend from work not the one you guys know) and I think that is all of I missed anyone my deepest apologies) that on Sat we just went out for coffee. In her entry Aimee was referring to her other job at the Scottish Rite. Aimee and I no longer go out and have the wild nights like we use to with lesbian making out, getting drinks bought for us and sexy dancing. We also use to be BIG make out sluts with the guys at the bars, however since we are both now unofficially married thre has been some changes. Later.

      Your the queen bitch Rosey!! (and I mean that in a good way)...I love it when I get called a bitch...I'm sure some of the girls last night were calling me a bitch. Sometime you gotta be one in order to get people to work. Last night everything went great...so I guess it pays to be a bitch every once in a while! (If your reading this Jessica...your not classified as one of the girls - nerds are excluded!) Changing topic: I did give into Pete's fantasies last night...and I must say It was goooooood!!!! That's all I'm sayin'! I'll call you later...

      Oh boy Aimee what a fun night and we didnt even get drunk! Mike is still not home yet but thats ok we need our space, by the way did you give in to Pete and have the sex? I would just like to say that I am fully aware that I have been a royal bitch lately, but you know what being on strike and out in the cold is no fun!!!! However I am aware that this is not an excuse, but I may never have an excuse again. As you are aware there are other stressors in my life which will hopefully be resolved soon . So I would just like to formally apologize to those people out there that I may have offended and will probally not intentionally continue to offend just by being my joyous self, regardless of my personal situation. Anyway have an excellent night and I will talk to you later. Love, Rosey XOXO

      I am having lots of trouble sleeping lately. Not sure why. I am working more  hours than ever and yet I can't seem to tire myself out. Yesterday I worked 12 hrs...came home...fell asleep around 10:30...and now I can't sleep. maybe I have a lot to think about subconsciously. Not sure what it would be. The only thing I do is work. I don't feel stressed about it either. I like working. I have been doing a lot more design a work as well...not to mention production and answering calls. We are so busy with the new company. It's crazy!! We should be grateful I guess. I bet I have triple the workload that I have had in the last three months. All of a sudden customers are coming out of the woodwork that haven't been around for a while...and they all of a sudden discovered that I am a designer...not just a secretary or production worker. I have been getting alot of positive feedback too...feeds the ego...which helps me to be more confident in the work that I do. I am getting some good portfolio pieces. Nothing too extreme...considering that the most time I have ever spent on a single job is 11 hours. Most customers are not willing to pay over $1000 for design from a printing company...so I have to get jobs done as quickly as possible...without sacrificing design integrity. I very important design skill I am acquiring. I am a perfectionist so quality of deisgn is always on my mind. Sometimes a challenge in the quick printing industy. But, hey I guess it makes life interesting...very face paced and sometimes stressful...but interesting. i am glad I work with the team that I do...because even though they drive me crazy sometimes...I can't picture working without them...We work so well together. Its the small familiy-like environment that I like. Where you can tell your boss to fuck off and not feel like your going to lose you job.   Wow I was really on a roll there! Maybe I am more tired than I thought...that was a lot of rambling. I'll probably read this in the morning and wonder what I was thinking.

      I am over at Pete's parents place. We have to wait a about twenty minutes until we catch the bus. So I figured I would write something. My weekend was pretty quiet. Work was boring yesterday. We had to serve a bunch of teenagers that are going to be future Mason's or Eastern Star. They had a dinner dance...the theme was mardi gras. It kinda reminded me of a high school dance from the eighties. I never attended a high school dance. If it was anything like what I saw last night..I understand why. Even though I have been working at the rite for a while now I still don't understand the whole organization. It's like some kind of secret society that gets together to eat and dance on a regular basis for no reason. I normally serve only 80-100 year olds. It was weird serving mere children. That's enough talk for now I gotta bus to catch!

      I can't sleep!!! This never happens to me. I have been up since 2am trying to tire myself out so that I'll fall asleep. I don't feel any stress or have any problems that I know of that would be keeping me awake at night. This sucks! Now I have to get ready for work...I hope today is not like yesterday. It's not likely that i'll be able to catch any z's at work. I'll actually have to drink coffee. Looking forward to the Spagetti dinner tonight Rosie. Hey maybe me stomach can't stop thinking about it and that's why I am awake! I think I'll stop trying to figure it out and go get ready. That's it. okay. okay.

      I have to go to work in 30 minutes. Some big wedding...I hate picky brides. The more weddings that work...the more I hate them. They are all the same. Rosie you better make your wedding fabulous... There is a client at Print Solutions that is getting married in August...and she hates weddings too...she was telling me about her plans. She has got the money to really make a memorable day too. She is having it at the Paletta Mansion in Burlington...stone terrace overlooking the water...no sit down dinner...just a huge coctail party with an 8 piece jazz band. She has a crazy colour scheme too - bright orange - lemon yellow - and fuschia- it sounds pretty wild. Must be nice to spend $5000 on flowers alone. I am making pete wash dishes tonight...he really doesn't want to...but he is unemployed so i have a little leverage. Gotta keep saving $$$$. Hopefully there is a good menu tonight...I am hungry!

      I am at work...all alone. Its weird. I never work evenings shifts. Its so quiet. I could sit here in my underwear and no one would even know it. I truly work in the 9 to 5 industry. The phone hasn't rang past 5. Hopefully I will get all my work done. That would be nice as yesterday when i left i had cleared most of it up...only to come in today to a desk full of stuff. Well at least no one is here to tell me to turn my music down! I'm gettin pretty hungry though...I wish i could get pete to bring me some food. I already asked him and he said no. He doesn't want to leave the apartment. I think i will have to go to Tim's to pick something up. I am usually at home enjoying a homecooked meal right now. I miss my manservant! (jk)   peace out!

      Well I ended up getting some sushi last night at Dado by limeridge mall, yeah for raw fish!! It had raw salmon, crab, shrimp and squid and california rolls. Not bad for 18 but we will see if I am still living in the morning. And with only 8crabs it was also good for me, had to add that in....Anyway we will definately see Taking Lives tomorrow I think its playing at 10 at Silver City. Later

Cant wait till we can go roller blading and go to the cottage. This weekend is looking pretty good three whole days off. There are some downfalls to the weekend but I wont get in to them. Anyway we should definately go and see Taking Lives tomorrow and have an awesome weekend!!!!!

      All I have to say is...I HAVE NO TOLERANCE! It was a great night! I think I was acting a little silly though. I guess thats the fun part about being drunk. It makes me think back to the good old clubbing days...drinkin every weekend....dancin like a crazyperson...having lots of energy. Hey...at least I can still remember those times...I think Alex may be a little frightened of me. I get REALLY happy while intoxicated. Thanks for a good time guys!

      It doesn't look too bad outside today. It has been such a miserable week. I was waiting for the animals to come marching by two by two. It is weird when you don't see the sun for a week straight. Well this weekend my goal is to get all my shit archived and then reinstall. i will finally join the rest of the mac world...yes I am upgrading to OSX! Should be nice...my baby is pretty sick lately. But I can't really complain...she still runs. Considering it has been almost two years since my last reinstall...she runs pretty good. I have about 35 gigs of stuff to back up. That is the main problem. I never have the time to sit down and burn all my files. Damn photoshop! I love it but it creates such huge file sizes! Or maybe that is just me creating everything in 600dpi minimum. That is what happens when you work in the print industry...when you see the crap that people want printed. People always save stuff in 72 dpi...I always have to explain to them the difference between web and print resolution. Anyways, enough shop talk...back to archiving!

      There have been a lot of things on my mind lately...I guess at this point i might as well post them. Pete and I have decided to go our separate ways. It has been an interesting five years.  We have had some really  great times. Now its time to find a new apartment...and all the other fun stuff that goes along with it. I am trying to stay positive...its a new chapter of my life...I couldn't have gotten through the toughest time of my life without support  from my friends...especially you Rosey. I had great time last night at your place....you seemed to have a good time too...even if you didn't get me to take my shirt off!! hehe...maybe next time!

Amanda is even cooler...I need some weed...so does rosey she says we should find and all night weed store.

      Just sittin around naked on a sunday morning...Happy Mothers day Mom! (not that you would be reading this...you don't even know how to turn a computer on let alone have internet access) Anyways,  Its the thought that counts...right? Gotta visit both moms today. I better not eat anything all day as im sure petes mom will be shoveling food down my throat. (I do love her cooking!) I am going to spend the evening with my mom, we are watching survivor...and no im not going over there just to use her cable tv. (hehe) My mom was supposed to have surgery in june and now it has been pushed ahead to the 25th of May. So...she'll be in the hospital for my birthday. Oh well...i don't really care. I think that is the day that we come back from the cottage too. Rosie did you find out about your vacation yet? I really hope you get it ok...I won't go without you...it would be no fun...we haven't gone anywhere together in a few years. Have fun at church today! Talk to you later.

      Well we just got back from rollerblading. I had my first fall of the season. Man..did i hit hard! I am really starting to feel it now. Its a good thing i landed on my ass...or i could have caused some real damage. My shoulder is really tender...luckily it is the left side that took most of the impact, or I would be having a hard time typing this...or working. My elbow stings a little from the road rash...should heal pretty quickly. I think i am well enough to kick both becky and pearson's ass at mini golf tonight still. If i lose i can say they had an unfair advantage!

      Its saturday morning....I have been up since 6 am...and i'm bored. Just sitting around listening to some good old 80's. i updated my cam after playing around with photoshop. I think i'll go for a bike ride today. It looks a little like rain...but i don't care riding in the rain is fun. I think i'll go mini putting tonight if the weather holds up. I'm glad may 24 is coming up...we have been waiting forever. I've never been to the cottage so it should be an experience! I'll probably be bored later...so i might post again.   Ooooh...David Bowie...I like this song. "Modern Love, walks beside me...modern love, walks on by me...gets me to the church on time......(church on time) terrifies me, (church on time) makes me party.....i don't believe in modern love"

      So I don't have that deadline for noon tomorrow anymore...thank god! I can stretch it out over the weekend. So I can work a bit tomorrow and probably Sunday. As long as I have the job done by Monday at 8am...thats alright i guess...kinda kills the weekend, but oh well...its better than working myself to death in a short period of time...i'll just do it slowly instead! I really have to learn to say no at work...i always tend to blame my bosses for my exhaustion but...i guess its really my choice to disappoint the customers or not. I guess they get paid to deal with stuff like that cuz i certainly don't. Its just so hard to turn down work when you really need the money.

      I don't feel like I am really getting a holiday this week. I have been at work since 6:30 this morning and will be here until at least 6:30 tonight. Because of the holiday...i lose out on production time...which in the long run makes more work for me. So I will still work my normal hours only they are compressed into 3.5 days rather than 5. I can say that i will be glad to see tommorrow at noon. I will probably just go to sleep when i get home. When i was walking downtown at 6 am i only saw about 10 cars on the road...it was kinda creepy...so quiet. It feels like its gonna be a hot day out today. I was sweating and i only walked 10 minutes to downtown...and i don't sweat. i don't have much else to post about...since my life IS work recently. Maybe i'll have more to say on the weekend.

      So I have been packing all morning. I have so much stuff! its kinda good that I am moving into a smaller place...because it forces me to chuck a shitload of stuff that I dont need. I have never seen so many wires and cords in my life. pete has a habit of collecting bits and pieces of electronics and throwing them all in a box. Like anyone really needs 25 AC adaptors that have been disconnected from whichever device they originated! Theres coax cable, speaker wires, adaptors of all shapes and sizes, capacitors, LEDS, you name it we've got it! They all get tangled up and whenever he actually needs something like that he can't be bothered to go through his box of treasures so he just buys a new one...thus adding to the pile and my headache. So i have to be tough and actually get rid of this stuff...which is hard to do...you always think that someday you'll actually use the stuff. It hasn't happened in five years...and if i do need it i'll just buy it. Hey maybe i could start a surplus store.  I have the bathroom done....I have gotten so many decorative soaps for christmas presents that i never use...i think i'll donate them or something. I use body wash so i never use all that fancy stuff. I must have had at least 20 bars of exotic smelling beauty bars...taking up space. I found two 12 pack boxes of kraft dinner in my linen closet...not sure how they got there i don't even eat the stuff! The computer room will be the biggest challenge. Our closets are filled to the top with stuff that we never use.... man am I ever looking forward to that! i have to pack stuff in small bits...as it is painful to decide what to throw away and what to keep. I don't think i'll be using my notes from university again...but you never know....  back to it.....

I get the keys july 15 so i guess i should be unpacked by the beginning of august...hopefully...

      Well..Off for five days starting June 30 and nothing to do..Apparently Mike and I are not skilled enough to use my dads cottage for the weekend until we are shown exactly how to set it up and of course Sharps cottage is off limits due to others using it (dont get me started) but I guess we had our 24!!It would be nice if we could all get along but I guess that is unrealistic, plus there will be 3kids there that weekend so it wont be that relaxing.. So we will probally stay in boring Hamilton and maybe do some day trips..My life consists of work, watching all the eposisodes of Queer as Folk (i am downloading all the eposoides)those gay men sure are hot!!hopefully things will perk up for us this summer!!!!!!!

      So, I just got home. I feel like im never home anymore...I guess I am avoiding being here. I have had a very busy weekend so far. The Sound of Music festival kicks ass. Work was extremely easy last night. I was outta there by 10:30...which is highly unusual. Oh well i won't complain. Met up with Adrian for some drinks...fever sucked ass...they changed it again...no techno...i guess its a summer thing...cuz everyone is at hess they only have one room open and i guess they figure that the majority of the people that go there enjoy listening to shitty music. Now that there is no smoking they have a roped of area out on king street by the tim hortons. I don't know if your supposed to take drinks out there but we did anyways. It was weird standing out on king street drinking beer. I don't think the security guy was even paying attention, as there were two fat chicks wearing clothes too small for them hitting on him...and he wasn't much to look at himself so i guess he was interested. I'm mean...oh well! So we ate some sausage...always a good thing after leaving a bar. Adrian had a detailed conversation with the girl behind the stand about perrenials...i think she was impressed. So we needed to get our techno fix...so we just went back to adrians listened to some techno , drank some beer and played mariokart till we were ready to pass out. Good times! So rosey...lookin forward to seeing you tonight...its been a while.

It turns out Mike and some friends are going to the music festival on Sunday, so maybe he can meet the famous Chad hahha. Good Luck with the apartment hunting.

Give me a call in the morning if you can so you can pick your squares for the draw, 2 each and you could win a drum with sex toys!! Have a great weekend out of town!!!!I will be thinking about you

      I don't remember the last time I walked so much! I met Joe and Yvonne yesterday after work...we walked around all night till around 10pm. First we went to the liquor store to get some gin to mix in our juice and then we were off...we walked all the way to scenic drive and then back down to the garth street stairs. Its a lot more fun hiking around town when you've got some refreshments. You don't even notice that you feet are sore either...I should do this more often...although I think its probably only good when your with the right people...im not sure how many people would be willing to walk that far. It was a good way to get away from the apartment for a while.

      I am meeting up with Joe and yvonne tonight to see if I can find an apartment. They too need to find a place by July 1st. I figure that a lot of people put "for rent" signs up but do not advertise. Hopefully I'll get something in the southwest area. Its actually pretty dead here at work right now. I am all caught up with everything...which will give me a chance to start being more organized....whatever that means. I'll probably just move all of the stuff to another area, so it looks neat, kinda like hiding all your junk under the bed.

      I went to work last night at 4pm. I got home at 3:30am. It was a long night...so why am I awake? I think its the morning person thing. This is actually a late start for me but  considering what time i got home i guess not. Everything went pretty smooth. I picked a great night to go back to work a wedding for 200....there are a lot of new staff there too...they are all sooooo young...it makes me feel so old! One couple, I think they are around 17 were supossed to stay till the end of the night to help finish up all the dishes (and there were lots believe me!) but they got too tired around midnight....so guess who decides that its ok and she'll finish up. There we way more dishes than i thought. Plus the kitchen had to be mopped up...although its a good way to build muscle. Anyways...I think im going to have a shower, then give joe and yvonne a call to see if they want to go hiking. Hey Rosie maybe we can go for coffee tonight since you are only working till 9?

So yesterday I partied at Aaron and Lisa til about 1am and five beers later, good times. Found out that yes in fact Lisa does know Adrian, in fact assman is her brother (weird). Today we had my cousins wedding more fun!! Anyway working tomorrow 5-9 so hopefully I will catch up with ya, peace

      So i got back from the hospital around midnight. And my mom is ok...i think there were complications with all of the pills she was taking. She had like 10 different pills in her purse. I don't think i could handle that. I hate taking pills. I would have to write down which ones to take and when....if i had ten different pills. The doctor said she is going through instant menopause...i guess its fairly common after a hysterectomy. At least she is ok...although I shouldn't have been surprised...she is a frequent user of the emergency room. I think she collects points or something! I hate hospitals and doctors...i would avoid both. There was a really hot sercurity guard though...where they make you sign in and disinfect your hands. So i'm going to start sorting through some of my shit today. I have too much stuff for one person. I have to go to the liquor store to get some boxes.  I think i'll head over there now.  Haven't talked to you in a while Rosey, hope everything went well on thursday. Have fun at the wedding this weekend!

      I just got up. I am in pain. I hate being a girl. I feel like someone is turning my insides out. Thank god this feeling only lasts a day...well the really bad cramps anyways. As soon as i got to work i wanted to leave.It was an ok day. Not too much work to do. Pete told me that joanne wanted me to work tonight, there is no way that i would have been able to function. I may work tommorrow to get some extra cash...there are some things that i'll need to buy for the new apartment.  Everyone left early today...I left at 4:30...after a day of misery. I can't believe i lasted that long.   **My mom just called she is having really bad chest pains...so i have to go to the hospital right now with her. I hope everything is ok....she was doing so good after the operation**

      We'll its my last day at my apartment. Everything is pretty much packed up and ready to go. Except for a few misc. things lying around. We are on our way  to get the uhaul in about 15 minutes. It is a sad day...but I am getting a new apartment and a new life all on my own. It is quite a scary thought for me. I have never truly been on my own. So...since I wont have internet or phone till tuesday....I'll have to post from work on Monday...I have decided to go in and get some hours that I will be missing on tuesday while the bell tech installs the line. Well times up gotta go get the truck. Wish me luck!!!

      ooooooo...ahhhhh...a new interface...lets see...i think i wanna type using    Trebuchet Bold in red...hehe...this is neat.    I like blue better...there. So the packing is almost finished...just a few loose things lying around the apartment. It looks really weird. Its a little sad too. I really loved my apartment...I can't really remember what the new one looks like, its been about a month and a half since I saw it. The one thing that I remember&nbsp;is that it was really clean...I think that is a good thing. I dont like the cupboards...but I can&nbsp;paint them for a quick fix. I did it in&nbsp;my current apartment...I wonder if i'll get in trouble for all the painting I did? I painted all of the wood surfaces except the hardwood floors which i'll miss the most...but all the other wood&nbsp;was really ugly so&nbsp;I was justified. So it sucks that I can't come up to the cottage this weekend...but I have no choice...hopefully I can come up sometime before the summer is over. I need a break...moving is so stressful! I'll be glad once its done cuz then maybe i'll have something else to write about... I can start complaining about work again...cuz&nbsp;you&nbsp;know how interesting that can be. geez...my life is pretty boring...i'm gonna need to spice things up a little. Well Rosey, Have a great time at the cottage...I'll miss you! I should have my phone installed by tuesday morning so give me a call when you get home...k.

      so I just woke up. I came home from work yesterday around 5:30...and I went to sleep. Woke up a few times...and tried to convince myself that I was going to go to see a movie....didn't happen. I just couldn't get out of bed. I think it was for the best though...cuz i feel nice and rested today. Now that Im not getting my apartment till the end of the month...I still have packing to do. I was just thinking about the lack of space i am going to have. I really dont think i will have enough room for all my stuff....and I keep everything. This could be a dilemma. Rosey I might need your help this weekend...in decideing what i need to keep. I know i am keeping the lego blocks...there are just so many (approx 30,000 pieces) Pete said he may put the monster speakers in storgage...as he thought about getting rid of them and is not quite sure he can part with them. I remember you calling me yesterday...but i dont remember what we talked about...I was half asleep. Try again today.

      So I'm at work right now. I just got my phone installed this afternoon...But I wont have internet connection until early next week. Boo hoo. Oh well at least I can go online at work. So...Did I mention that the move was a disaster! So here are the details...We woke up Saturday morning...And of course it was raining. So we went and got the truck...Packed it up till I could go pick up the key at 10:30. We dropped some stuff off at the storage locker...Then I came back to the apartment to call the property manager to pick up the key...And my phone was disconnected. The fucking bastards at bell cut the line too early....So I had to go to the hospital to call from a pay phone. Which is interesting when you are calling an answering service to page someone. So I had to get the guy to leave a message with my sister since I had no phone to be reached at. I call Becky back about 30 minutes later...He says I can't get the key until 3:00. So My dad, Becky and Pearson show up to pack up my dads van, and the truck. Then we are loading up all the stuff onto the elevator. We get it downstairs and loaded in the truck...The elevator is now empty ready for the next load...So I get in ready to go up and I push the button for the 3rd floor...Nothing...The elevator is stuck!...Just my luck! So it takes my dad and Pete about ten minutes to pry the doors open...And needless to say the elevator is toast! So...I live on the third floor and the vehicles are on the basement level. We all had a great time carrying all of my shit down those stairs let me tell you. An experience we'll never forget! My new apartment is on the second floor...Which has no elevator...So there was more fun in store. The day was extremely hot and humid so we were all exhausted! I must say thanks to my dad, Becky and Pearson and of course Pete...Who didn't have to stay and help me...But broke his back doing it anyways!. I couldn't have done it without their help! I'll write more later...
