      Sheesh, you ever get those days where nothing tastes right?  I decided to make a soup tonight for dinner instead of the normal stuff.  What started out to be French Onion soup, ended up being something all together weird.  I guess that is what I get for letting my 6 year old foster daughter help me make decisions.  It didn't taste bad at least.  My hubby went for seconds.  I wasn't all that impressed with it myself.  I can't cook with all the extra spices I used to since we got into foster care.  Kids are picky eaters!

      Okay, for reasons unbeknownst to me, I believe that food on the weekends has no calories. Why on earth is that? I feel like I should reward myself, making it yet through another week of work, traffic jams and other nuissances. This weekend was especailly bad, since it lasted 4 days. Comes the week, I have no problem sticking with my diet.  I exercise daily for about 45 min every morning, walk at night, eat healthy foods, but then comes the big Saturday, Sunday fallout. I'm with my most fabulous husband and it just seems natural to have more fun eating together rather than alone. Maybe that's it. I usually hate eating by myself and will forget food altogether when alone. I need to ponder this thought a bit more, until then, I'm somewhat glad it's Tuesday, but then again, I can't WAIT for it to be Friday. Peace.

      One of the things that I have just come to realize is that once a day at least I enjoy the sensation of having eaten enough. Just slightly at the peripheral of being "full." It seems that all day I think about food, because I just haven't had enough to experience that state of satisfaction of having had 'nuff' food.  I therefore have resorted to eating more often, which seems counter-productive trying to lose weight, but at least I'm not starving myself from breakfast to lunch to dinner. That miserable inbetween feeling really is what makes dieting extremely difficult. So, like all other dieters out there, and I know you all have done it as well, I have been completely suckered into the green tea vitamins and the carb blocker chewies. If the placebo effect works, well heck yeah, I'm going for it!  But there's one thing that I have read in the carb blocker guide - Glycemic Index! A friend  recently brought this to my attention as well and I have looked into a few websites regarding this issue.   http://www.glycemicindex.com http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/glycemic.asp http://www.prevention.com/cda/feature2002/0,2479,s1-5158,00.html  It appears that not all carbs are created equal. Complex carbs (apples, nuts, etc) may be enjoyed rather frequently whereas simple carbs (bread, pasta, rice) only in extreme moderation.   SlimFast has been a tremendous help, don't get me wrong, but I can't live the rest of my life on chocolate and peanut butter flavored candy bars. We're real people with real jobs and real issues. We must burn calories and be fatter than Calista Flockhard, otherwise we couldn't gripe about how freaking skinny she is, right? This is the real world. The magazine covers and movies aren't real...but we already knew that.  So, once more...TV, MOVIES and MAGAZINES - Fantasy world. You, I and rest of REAL WORLD!  Okay,okay let's stop kidding ourselves...Let's get skinny!
