      I gave my blog link to Amrita and she calls me up and says 'WOW Looks good, but i think you should improve the contents a bit more'. I couldnt muster up enough courage to tell her that the only part I played in my blog was in writing down the contents, and the looks are from a pre-made template. *sniff*.  I was reading about one of the possible endings to the matrix trilogy and i came across this article which spoke of a concept that was totally new to me. The concept was called "Simulacra" and they defined it thus :  "Simulacrum is not that which conceals the truth. It is that which conceals that there is none.Simulacra is true"  It was upon this concept that the entire matrix movie was made. It tries to tell you that whatever you see around you, whatever you believe to be true, need not be true. It is not tellign you that they are not true, but rather that there is nothing that is true. A truth is true only as long as you believe it to be true. Taking the example int he movie, 'The Matrix' , The orphan says "Do not try to bend the spoon, it is not possible but rather try to realise the truth" Neo asks "What truth?" The orphan replies "That there is no spoon.Then you will realize that it is not the spoon that bends, it is you"  This is exactly the principle of simulacra. So what is this world that we currently live in? You believe that something is true because when you look at an object and say thats a mouse, everybody agrees to it. But isnt this because everybody have been taught the same thing right from the beginning and we blindly follow it. We assume in our subconscious mind that you cant get the mouse up in the air without physically lifting it. This is our concept of truth. The things assumed by our sub conscious mind. We call it a simulacrum. there is this fog above the actual truth,that prevents us from what the real truth is. The fog in front of our eyes which prevents us from seeing the bright road ahead.  I have been thinking about this concept for a long time and then i bumped into another article "The Simulacrum of organised Religion".Here are some excerpts fromthe article.  'A "true believer" also looks to some prophet or wise one who spoke to the "chosen" long ago and gave us all guidance because the idea that we must guide ourselves through a chaotic and mindless universe is too terrifying to comprehend.' 'The problem I have with organized religion is not that it seeks to some form of spiritual enlightenment, rather, it seeks to guise itself as a path to spiritual enlightenment, when in fact it simply wants followers willing to believe whatever they are told. True spiritual enlightenment is possible only from within and cannot be given by any external source' 'Religion tricks followers into believing that they are going to reach this self-actualization if they adhere to the rules and teachings of their deity. It is probably the greatest sham that has ever been perpetrated on a sentient being: to take away their individual greatness and replace it with the tattered remnants of someone else's idea of what greatness should be. Karl Marx called religion the opiate of the masses; it becomes the lives of those who live it and the power of those who lead it. The roots of religion are deep and hard to pull out.' 'Religion is a simulacrum: something that is made real by its believers, not something that is believed in because it is real. If wishing would make it so, then we all should learn to bend our knees to the invisible deities that keep us, punish us, judge us, and allow us such suffering and misery, but say they really love us…humanity must solve human problems and learn to live with death. Expecting anything less is waiting for someone or something else to make it all right. Prey if you must (spelling intentional). The sheep are led to the slaughter and the meek shall inherit the wind.'  So all a religion does is to create a fog in front of your eyes, whereby you start listening to only the things that you are taught to listen to, you start seeing only the things that you are taught to look upon.  Well the choice is yours. Nobody is stopping you from seeking God your way, the right way!! But always keep this in mind, do you have to depend on rusty traditions and customs to do that? Think about it.

      These are the lyrics to the song "Fucking Hostile". I am listening to this song for something like the 20th time in a row. I used to like this song just for the music, had never really given a second thought to what the lyrics meant.  These lines are so filled with sarcasm and so to the point that you sit back and find yourself in a tough spot to answer him. The song is against establishment as such, when I talk in general sense. He tells you that you have been seeing the same things everywhere, doing the samethings people have been doing since ages, blindly following the customs and traditions that has been set down by someone ages ago. He says if you could see yourself , you would understand that what you do is nothing that you want for yourself or what you know is true. Things have been taught to you, and you follow them blindly.  Almost every day I see the same face On broken picture tube It fits the attitude If you could see yourself You put you on a shelf Your verbal masturbate Promise to nauseate  Today I'll play the part of non-parent Not make a hundred rules For you to know about yoursef Not lie and make you believe What's evil is making love and making friends and meeting God you're own way The right way  He says to meet God or to make friend you don’t need a 100 laws. And in trying to teach me to do all this , you are just making me fuc*ing hostile.  To see To bleed Cannot be taught In turn You're making us Fucking hostile  These lines that follow are funny and against that authority which arrests a person for smoking a joint, but let the big fishes in the dope market survive.   We stand alone The truth in right and wrong The boundaries of the law You seem to miss the point Arresting for a joint?  You seem to wonder why Hundreds of people die You're writing tickets man My mom got jumped -- they ran!  Now I'll play a public servant To serve and protect By the law and the state I'd bust the punks That rape steal and murder And leave you be If you crossed me I'd shake your hand like a man Not a god  These lines are really well done. Totally mocking at the existence of religions and the laws that you follow without really knowing what these were made for or because you were offered things that are present only in your fantasy that your sane mind tells you don’t exist.  Come meet your maker, boy Some things you can't enjoy Because of heaven/hell A fucking wives' tale They put it in your head Then put you in your bed He's watching say your prayers Cause God is everywhere Now I'll play a man learning priesthood Who's about to take the ultimate test in life I'd question things because I am human And call NO ONE my father who's no closer that a stranger I won't listen  So is it worth sticking on to all the rules and restriction that’s put on you when your mind tells you that you could have done much better without them. Do we really need all these laws that if broken can build a world totally beautiful for you. Why do we stck on to these barriers of caste, religion, race when all they ever gave you was rules to tie you down and keep your mind from flying free and unleashing what you could have been. Is this life in which you are now forced to live surrendering your emotions to social obligations, the one that you really want to live. If you havent given it much thought till now, I pray you, do not destroy your life by bowing to the society and their rules. Break free, live your life, cos it just might make this world a beautiful place for someone else too. Stand up and say out loud : I WON'T LISTEN!!

      I found these beautiful words from foutainhead :   "You'd rather not hear it now? But I want you to hear it. We never need to say anything to each other when we're together. This is--for the time when we won't be together. I love you. As selfishly as my lungs breathe air. I breathe for my own necessity, for the fuel of my body, for my survival............and let her go."  I liked it so much that put the whole thing on my  urlLink site .

      I just got an account on freeshell.org. The url is http://cleo.freeshell.org. There is nothing but a one liner page there now, but I am thiking of dropping the domain i have and migrate onto there. It's kinda nice to have a shell online with 100 mb space and 100 mail space and 100 mb webspace for a life time membership of 36$ rather than to own a domain for a charge of 38$ every year.   And hence since i will belosing my domain after a year, I though I should get back to posting.  Now to decide a place where I can blog was tough , So I decided to blog here.  This place looks really cool now with all the new templates an all.   So back to BlogSpot.

      I bought a new Microsoft keyboard and a Microsoft optical mouse yesterday and since then I have become a huge fan of the microsoft hardware. The keyboard is easily the best keyboard i have used till date. The keyboard is smooth and black and absolutely silent. Its very well designed and yo feel like typing all the time. The mouse is kinda good too. It looks really stunnig. and I personally feel that microsoft has an edge over any other hardware company. This is easily the best keyboard(except for the Sun keyboard that we used to use for our Solaris machines in college)  that i have used. I have even tried the apple keyboard, but it didnt quite impress me. I have to give it to Microsoft for this.   Saying it once more .. Microsoft is the best hardware peripheral company I have come accross till now( apart from Sun of course) . When it comes to software my appreciation for microsoft can be gauged by the fact that I am using linux right now to blog this.  Today's article on the  urlLink Microsoft Internet explorer
