      It is hard to believe that summer is here and school is out.  We only have four months to get everything ready!!.  This week I attended a homeschool convention in NC to pick out the curriculum we will use with Taylor.  Today we got the dinghy attached to the boat and practiced using it.  Arial is not so sure about the whole thing.  We are also trying to get her 'to go' on deck.  That isn't going so well either :(   Oh well it will all work out.  This weekend is Memorial Day. I think we will stay off the water until after the holiday, to many boats out there.    Also for those of you who know the saying, 'If you haven't been aground, then you haven't been around',  well....we went aground this week.  It wasn't that bad, just had to wait an hour until the tide came back!!!

      This has got to be one of the most adventurous ideas I can imagine.   What opportunities, challenges, excitement, vistas, and adventures await this family?  We landlubbers will have to be content reading this blog over the next year, or so...  So here we are, just imagining the stories that Arnold, Bobbi Jo and Taylor will have to share on the pages of this blog.  I can hardly wait, and I not even going.  What's up with that?

      Our families will be glad to know that today we purchased automatic inflatable life vests for all of us, we hope to never have to use them.  However I am sure Taylor will want to test them out and will jump in the water at his first opportunity to see if they really blow up!

      Hi, this is Taylor.  It will be fun to not go to school. I got a new night light in my room on the boat.

      This had been a rainy week here in Charleston, as a result we did not get as much done on the boat as we had hoped.  But today, Mother's Day, it is beautiful and we plan to spend the afternoon finishing the life lines.  We thought we would also make sure our new grill works and grill some steaks!!  If I can ever figure out how to add photos to this blog I will surely do so.  I have learned I am not very computer savy and will probably have to recruit a friend to help me. :)  I recently completed a Cruise Planning course presented by the US Power Squadron and will be taking my final test for the Piloting Class in the next two week. This is a navigation course, that is suppose to teach me how to not get lost and end up in the middle of the ocean.  I will let everyone know how I do on the exam.  If I don't pass, then maybe we should reconsider this trip.  Something to think about!

      Thank you's! There are some people we would like to thank as we move forward.  There have been a number of people who have helped us, some didn't even now why.  First of all we would like to thank those people who kept our secret a secret.  You know who you are and we thank you very much.   We want to thank our families, who have been so supportive of us, encouraged us and will probably worry greatly.  We would also like to thank everyone who had been praying for us and those that will continue to do so.  That means a lot to all three of us (four including Arial).  Specifically we want to thank:  Phil Harkey  - For helping us find the right boat, bringing it back to Charleston, for replacing the electric panel and for your long time friendship.  Good luck to you as you enter Seminary and further your ministry.  Cliff Parker  - For helping us bring the boat back from Florida.  Yes Cliff, I have learned to drive the boat :)  Jackie Parker - For letting Cliff help us move the boat, and for all your help with trying to figure out what to do with our house.  Rae Wooten - For letting us dock at your house, and your willingness to let our friends and the people we hired to work on the boat, trape through your yard to get to it.   For your encouragement, your friendship and your words of wisdom.  Terry & Terri MacIntosh  -For all of your help on the boat, from the engines, to cleaning, to helping us learn to dock it.  We have some great (and scary) memories.  Lori and Rich Miller - Thank you for the lap top computer....you didn't even know what you were donating it to.   Wayne & Mary Jane Nelson  -  Thank you for your wisdom and guidance on how to set up a web page and many other technical questions that needed to be answered.  Jack Hoye  - Your words of encouragement and wisdom that you gave to Arnold.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Dad O'Neal  - For all the work you did on the upholstery and the bimini, they both look great.  DesJardins Small Group  - What can we say? You are all great.  Kerry Haupert - For helping us with the life lines, for most of all for being a great friend and small group co-leader.  You will make a great homebase manager!! Thanks-a-bunch!  Thanks to each of you and also to the many others who have made this trip possible.

      The O'Neal's are planning the trip of a life time. We look forward to sharing with you our adventures as we prepare and push off. We hope that you will follow along with us as we  Imagine  the possibilities. We are preparing for a year long adventure on our 36 ft. Gulfstar Trawler  Imagine . We will be departing in the fall of 2004 from Charleston , SC and traveling down the intercoastal waterway (ICW) to Key West. From there we plan to travel to many of the islands in the Bahamas and the Caribbean. We are also interested in completing the Great Loop or the Great Circle as some call it. This is a trip up the ICW, across the great lakes, and then down the Mississippi River and back the the Keys. Time will tell how far we get before the money runs out!!!   Currently we are working hard to get the boat ready for push off. The boat was purchased in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida in December of 2003. Arnold and two of his friends, Phil Harkey and Cliff Parker, brought the boat back to Charleston. It is currently docked at the home of Rae Wooten (our great friend) on Johns Island.   To this date many changes have been made to the boat. We have added a new electrical panel, lectrosan, 2 new VHF radios, a radar, chartplotter, new bimini with new glass, new upholstery on all the cushions, new batteries and battery charger, new furniture,a new dinghy and motor, plus many other small extras. We are getting very nearly completed with the boat. We are currently in the process of adding life line netting around the boat (to keep Taylor and Arial on the boat!). We have some more canvas work that will be completed in the next few weeks and are finishing up the refridgeration requirements. In a few months we will haul the boat out of the water to have the bottom painted. Once the boat is back in the water we will move on and set up home.   Taylor was initially a little apprehensive about the idea, but he is getting use to the idea and is looking forward to 'swimming with the dolphins' when we get to the Keys. Taylor will be home schooled using a system called Switched on Schoolhouse. This is an computer program that we think Taylor will really enjoy. I think that Taylor will flourish in that environment. I plan on having him update this site with his own news in the very near future. :)   The question has been asked....Why now? This has been something we have wanted to do for a long time. We attempted this one other time, as some of you may recall. We moved on a sailboat, however the timing was just not right. Since that time we have learned a lot. The other concern is that Arnold's eyes have gotten worse. We have come to realize that if we do not move forward with this trip now, we may never get the opportunity. I must say that a lot of prayer went into planning this trip and it is amazing how well everything has come together. God has really be blessing us.   So where did we get the name for the our boat,  Imagine ? Actually from church. Our church, SeaCoast, did a series last year entitled  Imagine the Possibilities . It was during that time that we were deciding to take off for the adventure of a life time. It seemed very appropriate that we would name the boat  Imagine . And believe me when I say that we are Imagining the Possibilities!!!!   We hope that you will check in often and see the progress of our preparations, not only for the boat but for our house. Please bare with me and I am learning how to use webposting and will try to post pictures in the very near future.

       urlLink    Well we have finally made a decision regarding our house.  We weren't sure whether to sell or rent....the verdict....RENT.  Our Charleston friend's are happy (they are now convinced that we will come back).  Arnold is happy...we stay in the real estate market.   A property management company is happy, they have more business.  We just pray that we get a good renter who doesn't trash our house while we are gone!  Now it is time for a BIG yard sale....it is never ending!

      Only a few weeks listed in the paper and....the house is rented!  A lease was signed yesterday so we have to be out of our house by August 31.  We will be moving on the boat and setting up 'house' there.  The days are clicking away on the calendar.   Yikes I really do need to have a yard sale!
