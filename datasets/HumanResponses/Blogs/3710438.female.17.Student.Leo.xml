I am SOOOO excited to go see Jack Johnson again. He is amazing, brilliant, excellent! He is the love of my life, thats for sure. I LOOOOOOVE HIM!
Sucks that he is married. And that he is like 30. But I still love him all the same

      I came I saw I kicked some ass
The pain I cause it makes me laugh
'Cause the way I do my thing is strange
I just inject myself into your veins, yeah

Can't run can't hide 
There's no way out
The sun will rise and it's about
Time for the wreckoning
Time time for this girl to sing

Damn if I thought that you would change 
And my life would stay the same
When you don't even care about me
You know, you don't give a damn

Well things will come and things will go
And one thing I know for sure is that
You don't give a shit about me
And so I'm walking out the door. (oh yeah)

Can't move can't breathe it's gettin dark
The beast has come to steal your heart
So you better practice your scream
Well you may not live your dreams

Things will come and things will go
And one thing I know for sure is that
You don't give a shit about me
And so I'm walking out the door.

The wreckoning
The wreckoning
The wreckoning
Oh, it's time

The wreckoning
The wreckoning
The wreckoning
Oh, it's time

Damn if I thought that you would change 
And my life would stay the same
When you don't even care about me
You know, you don't give a damn

Things will come and things will go
And one thing I know for sure is that
You don't give a shit about me
And so I'm walking out the door.

The wreckoning
The wreckoning
The wreckoning
Oh, it's time

The wreckoning
The wreckoning
The wreckoning
Ya don't give a damn

And I'm running from my problems
I got my funny face painted on
And then I'll think of what you said to me
And then I'll think of what you did to me
I'll think of you and probably laugh
And then I'll think of you and probably laugh
And then I'll think of you and probably laugh
You're the one I'm running from

Damn if I thought that you would change 
And my life would stay the same
When you don't even care about me
Ah no, you don't give a damn

Well things will come and things will go
And one thing I know for sure is that
You don't give a shit about me
And so I'm walking out the door.

The wreckoning
The wreckoning 
The wreckoning
Oh, it's time

The wreckoning
The wreckoning
The wreckoning
Oh, it's time

The wreckoning
The wreckoning
The wreckoning
Ya don't give a damn

The wreckoning
The wreckoning
The wreckoning
I'm walking out the door

      The low down on the weekend hustle:
Saturday was practice in the morning, then home for a lovely good nap. 
Woke up and decided, I'm gonna get rid of my desk. So, I took the liberty of taking everything out of my desk and getting rid of a whoooole bunch of shit.
After the desk was cleaned out, I realized it was way too heavy to move so I watched the Italian Job again. GREAT MOVIE!
I watched Keeping the Faith on television after The Italian Job. My bro had a group of friends over so I had to manuever around them.
Sunday morning, a breakfast of pancakes and coffee cake. Did the laundry, did the dishes and cleaned the living room. I guess I am just in a cleaning sort of funk.
At the moment, I am lady of the house cause the 'rents are away.
I'm bored, and have nothing better to do than to sit on the computer. yayer.Unfortunatly no one is online, so there really is no point in sitting here right now.
I want to use british slang when i talk. Like say brilliant all the time, cause thats my favorite. or bloody. whichever.
And after watching the Italian Job 3 times this weekend, I have decided that Mos Def is way hot. oh yes. And Handsome Rob.

      So today was pretty exciting. I woke up for practice the tiredest I've ever felt. I swam shitty this morning, and again my shoulders were going to fall off.
I came home after going to Fast Lane for some morning coffee. I took a lovely nap.
Sarah called and invited me to see Dodgeball. I went. It was hilarious. FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY! 
We snuck in to Harry Potter, cause we both wanted to see it again. I'm telling you, 
I love Harry Potter. But so does the rest of the world, so I'm not original in that sense.
I skipped practice to see HP. It was well worth it. I think I deserved a practice off. 
I definatly don't regret it. 
I came home and me and my dad checked the car for malfunctions, i.e. Oil, tire pressure, transmission fluid and such.
That was fun and exciting. My bro called to say that he is spending the night at a friends. That means 
the house is brother free for at least another 24 hours. THANK THE LORD!
I feel like watching Zoolander. I am in a Ben Stiller mood. He is soooo funny. 
Zoolander is a great movie. I'm feelin the Zoolander. What is another Ben Stiller movie?
I think I should watch the Jack Johnson music video for Taylor. Ben is in that too!
Hmmm, interesting.

      Man, I was so tired this morning, and I thought my shoulders were going to fall off. That would hurt if your shoulders fell off. You wouldn't have any arms. Interesting.

Drivers ed was hell. It was so boring and I was tired and I wanted to sleep. After class we went to Fast Lane and got some yummy coffee from Jill! Tasty.

I got home and watched a cool movie, Red. It was in French but I could understand most of it. I enjoyed it. I recommend it.

I have nothing else to do today. No afternoon practice, nothing. Its kinda late in the day to do anything major, besides going to a movie or something of that sort.

Love Actually is an awesome movie. I love Hugh Grant. Oh yes!

      Anywho, Hilmar called today. That was exciting. I miss that kid sooooo much it is unbelievable. Actually, its pretty believable because he lives in Germany and we don't get to talk often. 
But we DID talk today. And it was so fun just hearing his voice again. 
It brought back the good memories.
Practice was hard this morning. I came home at took a 3 hour nap.
Yes it felt good! 

Ok, I don't understand this. This damn typer thing doesn't go down, it 
just goes across and its frusterating me. DAMNIT! WORK BITCH!

Sooooo, I have nothing to say today. This is longer than yesterdays. 
Chloe said yesterdays was shit. I would have to agree, but it took me like 
5 tries to get it to work. I said 3 yesterday didn't I? Well, whatever...
it took a long time and it pissed me off.
Practice is in 55 min.
