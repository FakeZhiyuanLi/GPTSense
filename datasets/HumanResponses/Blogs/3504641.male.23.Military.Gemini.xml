      hey all, i just came back from the pc show in the singapore expo.. didn't buy much, only 1 black printer cartridge for my epson c63 printer. the sales guy wanted so bad for me to be printing color photos with my printer so i can buy some more ink from him.. but i don't print photos la, firstly don't have a good quality camera, then also i think i should leave the printing to the shop experts.. just give the memory card to kodak shop and they just print it for you. no headache, no problem and no need to buy excess printer cartridges.. (anyway the c63 can't print tat well cos only got 4 colors, unlike other models with 6 colors..) hmmm, this year quite empty leh.. found it to be more unpopular than the last pc show in march. i didn't do much squeezing with the crowd and there was more than enough sales personnel to attend to me. first place i went was to the epson booth, then to the fujifilm booth.. close friends would know why i went there la.. but the model not there leh, think fujifilm bored of her liao.. =(  anyway i also went to check out the creative booth.. "bio"ing the creative muVo player leh.. quite easy to use and darn lightweight. BUT no money, payday still not here yet. and even if got my pay liao, i would be using up my entire month's pay.. so not worth it.. then went to the iriver booth.. keekee.. i've to admit la.. i was fooling around with that salesguy.. asked alot of questions and asked him to take out 1 of the cdplayers but in the end promised him that i would come back to buy but didn't.. so if happen by chance, u (the sales guy) are reading this, sorry la.. but i was really interested in that player but really no money.. okay?  okie!! now to the REAL reason why i wanted to go to the PC show. keekee it was to check out the babes these companies employed to parade in their costumes and give out leaflets and just to look good. kekeke this year not very nice, only the costume nice, the face of those gals just can't pass la.. shalln't mention more, else come monday gals with cleavers will come after me. but i did see some of those sales gals who are quite pretty, fair-skinned and slim and the works la.. i like!!

      just had a dinner last nite with a couple of secondary school friends.. the people who attended were maxime, yuanling, cindy, ivan, yaozu, yaozu's friend and myself of course. we went to this small jap restaurant in tanjong pajar named watari. totally sucks man!! don't anyone dare go there, sure to regret one.. the tempura tasted suspiciously like sweet potato, mushy and soft. not at all crunchy or fresh leh. then the beef also quite tough to chew. totally different place from 1 year ago. wenzhong ah, think u will also not miss this place. and now they are employing malay waiters and waitress, it just can't mix la.. malay and japanese.. just don't go well with each other..

      think i have worms in my tummy.. ate so much today but didn't feel bloated. my friends were asking me how come eat so much, so stress ah? how i know? my mouth felt itchy and the stomach, empty. u wouldn't believe what i ate.. 1 fan choy at 8am, 1 plate of cooked food at 1030am, 1 almond longan for dessert, 1 wan tan mee for lunch at 1pm, plus a tau pok & you tiao for follow-up, then tonite came back to eat roast chicken and fries for dinner. going crazy man! but how to exercise when i'm not really feeling well? my asthma's not really under control but i dare not venture into the gym, let alone go swim.. i shall wait for another week, see how my body reacts to the new medication that the specialist gave me.
