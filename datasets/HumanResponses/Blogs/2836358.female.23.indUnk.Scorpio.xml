      OK, we made it to Siena.  My mother drove 11 hours yesterday, nearly had a breakdown at the American Base in Vicenza, and yelled at me at every opportunity.  She does NOT handle stress well.  Holy Jesus.  Italy is amazing, but traveling with my mother could earn me a sainthood.  In fact, this city is the home of St. Catherine, who locked herself in her room for 3 years for ascetic purposes.  Whatever that means.  She was the last of 25 children.  And she received stigmata.  I'm receiving sharp pains in my temples.  Perhaps this is the 'crown of thorns' stigmata beginning to appear.  It is beautiful here.  We went to a Gothic cathedral.  It is breathtaking.  172 pope heads are carved into a layer of the vaulted ceiling.  I know this because my mom followed me all around the place, reading the guide book to me.  She asked me if I wanted the audio tour.  I said no.  She didn't hear me.  Then we ate ice cream.  Mine was tiramisu and slightly disappointing, but my duck breast with green pepper at lunch was absolutely delicious.  My momster is spending so much money and she wants us to have 'fun' so badly, but she is driving me insane.  She doesn't want to shop in any of the leather bag stores and she got mad when I wouldn't let her buy this ugly wall hanging with a knight on it.  I told her she would get it home and then realize that she didn't want it on any of her walls.  She looked dejected, so I told her to go get it and I would carry it back to the hotel for her.  Too late.  I'm evil.  She sulked out of the store and gave me dirty looks all day.    I would try to make her happy, but I really don't know how.  I'm tired.  She is already talking about all these places she wants to go in Germany when we get back.  I DON'T want to get into a car with her again for longer than 45 minutes!!!!  Help.  Ha ha.  I just saw an old man almost get run over by the street cleaner.  Don't worry, the street cleaner went around him.  It was a near hit, though.

      I'm alive!  So far.  We had a good drive here.  It took about 6 hours and now we're at the border of Austria.  It's LOVELY!  But I'm on a German keyboard and these things suck.  They switched the z and the y.  Why?  And of course all the quirky punctuation is hidden on number keys and such.  Tomorrow we drive through Austria and Switzerland.  The next day we are in Italy.  I think Aroun is getting 440,000 to buy apartments in France from his bank.  He said a lot of money is missing from his account, but that is ok and going to the vendor.  He said the missing money is coming back.  "He has made many calls to France.  It is hell here."   Damn.  Give me some money!  I desire him.  Unnaturally.  I think he's half an inch shorter than me and when my mom saw a picture of him the first thing she said was "Look how little his feet are!"  I gave her a look that could stop a clock.  Bitch.  It is obvious she is driving me nuts?  I love her, I really do, but I need alone time.  With a Marlboro Light.  I haven't smoked in ages, which is good for me.  I was up to a pack a day and I've only sneaked 4 ciggies since I've been in Germany (three nights now, I think).  OK, I'm going to watch some yodelers and women in traditional German dress dance around a restaurant now.  Miss you guys.  Or, miss zou guzs.  Kat

      i'm going to italy with my mother tomorrow.  she is the worst euro driver ever.  she is picking fights with me.  i am going to die.  pray for me.  she keeps talking about her money belt and tourist gelatos that get forced on americans for 10 dollars.  someone tell her that if she walks with a purpose and doesn't hold a map up in the middle of the sidewalk, she is far less likely to get bothered than she predicts.

      Hi Everyone, Well, a change is refreshing, actually.  I'll move away from the bright orange theme reminiscent of the Middle Eastern sun and adopt a goth I'm-a-German-kid-in-a-band sort of look.  I'm in Germany now.  I've been here about 24 hours and my mother is driving me INSANE.  I wanted to say to her all day 'You need a nap' but I knew it would piss her off.  Then we got home from Wal*Mart (pronounced Val-Mart) and she collapsed on her bed.  She slept 2 hours.  She did need a nap.  I put together a clothes hanging rack sort of thing that I was forced to buy at Val-Mart as there is NO space to hang anything of mine up here.  At least I have a king size bed for once, because I can sleep on one quarter and all my shit can be spread all over the rest of it.  I ate stuffed mushrooms, spicy Schezuan chicken, and a mini pizza today.  I love being home.  My mom stuffs me to within an inch of my life.  I found that I couldn't change UAE dirhams at the normal money exchange at the airport.  I had to take them to a bank.  A bank where I had an account, which I don't have anywhere in Germany.  But my momster does, so we went to Sparkasse Mainz bank and I changed my 540 dirhams and had the euros put in my mom's account.  The German man who helped us, who happened to be very Aryan, chuckled at my strange money.  "Vair did you geet it?"  Umm, the United Arab Emirates.  You know, Dubai.    Oh well, it amused him and I was thankful to finally be getting it changed into useful money.  Tomorrow I think we're going shopping in another town that begins with a V.  Or maybe a W.  Mom is on vacation and therefore wants to spend money.  We are going to go to Italy on the 26th.  We're driving through Switzerland, which I am dead excited about.  Hope mom doesn't kill us.  She really is the worst European driver ever, but she tries.  I'm reading an awesome book.  It's call 'Reading Lolita in Tehran'.  It's all about the Iranian revolution.  So far, some girls got in trouble for eating apples outside.  The guards told them that 'they were eating their apples too seductively.'  I would love to give a banana a blow job right in front of their faces.  They'd be so impaired by their erections that they wouldn't be able to chase me down.  *Snicker*

      Yesterday I was really depressed.  But it turned out that a lot of that was exhaustion.  I woke up because a school system in Virginia called me.  It was 9:30 their time, 6:30 my time.  That's retribution for calling Heather in Virginia at 11:30 her time and waking up her dad.  Tsk tsk tsk.  It's not kind to ignore the time difference.  So that school system sounds like they want me, but they haven't called me with the phone interview yet.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Then G-ma's home help person came, and she finished all her work half an hour early, but because I'm cruel (and I don't want her to get in the habit of leaving early) I had her sit with G-ma and read.  Tomorrow I don't know what I'll have her do because there isn't very much that is necessary.  Tomorrow is also G-ma's hair dressing thing and trip to the podiatrist.  So we have all kinds of excitement lined up for us.  I'm going to ask the nurse at the podiatrist to give G-ma a Valium so she'll relax.  Maybe she'll give me one, too.  So I put in my app with LA Unified School District.  I hope to God they give me a job.  Somewhere near Santa Clarita.  After investigating lots of other properties, I really appreciate the rent ($500 including everything -- pool, parking, cable, high speed internet, gas, water, electric)  The room is small but I have next to nothing here, it's all in Germany, and the house is so spacious and nice.  If I take it, I will have 3 roommates and I'll share a bathroom with two of them.  That's the drawback.  One of them attends school full-time and works full-time.  And yet she seemed pleasant.  I would be hell on wheels.  I like two men whom I have never met.  I met them on plentyoffish.com and they have written me e-mails with very few spelling mistakes.  I like that.  One is named Chandler.  I haven't asked him yet how many people think it's cute to call him Chandlah-Bing.  I'll save that for later, I'm sure it will mortify him and make me seem shallow, so sounds like first date material to me.  The other guy is named Rusty.  Ick.  I will have to give him a nickname.  Or use his real name.  He looks kind of Indian/American Indian/Latino/Arab/God knows what, so I feel sure he has a different name that is difficult to pronounce.  I will find a way to pronounce it just so I can escape calling him Rusty.  Anyway, one of them is visiting a sister in Chicago now and the other one lives around here and goes to the beach all the time.  I want him to take me jet-skiing.  The only thing is, I am unbelieveably pale and the Rite Aid fake tan I bought is barely taking the alabaster glow off, no matter how much I layer it.  Thank God it was a two-for-one special, because I'm going through it like a whore through latex.  I'm sitting here in my step-G-dad's study, having a Bloody Mary and imagining a life with a regular paycheck.  I earned $11 last night!  I tutored two men in math so that they could prepare for their water exams.  They test the water and stuff around here and they have to do some kind of exam to be recognized by the state as legal.  We had fun.  We did lots with fractions and converting parts per million to parts per billion.  They use lots of abbreviations that I am not familiar with, like MGD.  That's Millions of Gallons per Day.    I'm still not enrolled in the real estate course.  I have to get on the ball!!!!

      I had so much guilty fun yesterday!  I met an old professor/friend from Randolph-Macon.  Her name is Christine and she was my Islamic Art Professor.  She also wrote a great recommendation for me for the Fulbright grant.  I love her!  She brought her cute boyfriend, Scott, and we met up at the Getty Center.  We looked at photographs and modern architecture and then we went to Santa Monica, which seems to be the coolest place on earth.  There, we had DELICIOUS Thai food and chatted about anything and everything.  After a wedding today, they’re going to head to Las Vegas and then on home to Pennsylvania, where they both teach.  It was so cool to see an old friend.  And she looked good.  Her skin was so clear and her haircut was cute.  I adore Christine!  After we finished dinner, we walked outside and were SHOCKED and AMAZED to discover that the local street music was in Arabic, sung by an Arab dude.  Habibi (my darling) he sand, Wallah!!  (by God)  We were mesmerized for a few minutes.  Both of us had been awarded Fulbrights to Muslim countries, and we felt slightly homesick listening to the funky Arab beat.  We loved it.  I’ll never forget it.  When I got home at 1 in the morning, Grandma was pissed.  What a result!  She never gets angry!  She never cares about anything!  So it was a good step forward that she was mad at me for staying out so late.  I knew it was going to happen, though.  I wasn’t meeting them until 6 and the drive is 1.5 hours into L.A.  I knew I was going to be getting back at a CrAzY G-ma hour.  Then I got on the computer and she got even MORE miffed.  Shit.  So today I was extra nice to Granny.  I cooked her Salmon for dinner.  Today my friend Bekah called me and invited me to her house.  I hadn’t seen her since my sophomore year at Randolph-Macon, so I am in R-MWC reunion mode these days.  Her house is lovely and she has a pool.  I met her fiance, JJ.  They are both super Christian, so I kind of wanted to gag.  But they were super nice and we laid out by the pool and I got a little bit sun burned.  We talked about what kind of work is in the area.  She lives SO close to my G-ma’s house.  I’m happy about that.  But her wedding is in 7 weeks, so I don’t expect to see a lot of her.  Plus she is only home on the weekends.  (She lives in Bakersfield, which is pretty far north.)    So I have had a couple of good days, which I have to say I deserve.  I’ve been getting too depressed lately.  I’m going to take the Real Estate course with Century 21.  Hope it goes well!  I miss you guys.

      OK, still looking for a job.  Still annoyed by my bad skin.  Why is it that when you get a pimple, it lasts for three years, you pop it, it looks red (but mercifully flat), then two days of relief go by and you think "it's healing and will fade soon!" right then, you look again, and then you have a brand new fucking zit right on top of the old one.  it's awful!  i hate it.  and i'm being plagued by it.  i know that the zit is infesting the skin around it with bacteria, but I'm washing!!!  i really am.  it shouldn't be happening, but it is.  today we got a new girl in to help grandma do her stuff.  together, valencia and i discovered 4 huge new loads of dirty laundry.  ugh.  so we washed that.  and we secretly threw old ruined, stained things away.  and we threw crap away.  and we whittle the 52 towels in g-ma's bathroom down to 6.  and i found a lot of nice make-up in g-ma's bathroom that i'm going to steal.  and if i find anymore g-ma clothes that have not been worn in 3 years, i am going to sell them on ebay.  this is all i know.  we are going to the hairdresser's today, so we have a lot of excitement in our lives.  xxx kat

      OK, the job hunt is not going so well.  I sat in the parking lot of Target today, trying to get up the nerve to go in.  I couldn't do it.  I couldn't wear the red t-shirt and earn minimum wage.  So I smoke a cigarette and drove away.  The next stop was the community college.  I went inside, ignoring the 'pay and display' sticker thing for my car.  I have $1.  That's right, $1 until I get a job.  I swear I'm going to break down and spend it on a McDonald's sundae soon.  So I'm not wasting it on their stupid parking fee.  I went inside the CC, and it was a madhouse.  White trash, Mexicans, and old people everywhere.  They were all carrying yucky backpacks and looking pissed off.  I couldn't do it.  I couldn't wait in line to find out that no, I won't be allowed in the real estate course even if I suck Dr. Schaff's dick and no, I'm not considered in-state and will have to pay $500 for the course.  So I turned around and navigated my way past all the losers in old flip flops and back to my car (which didn't get a ticket).  But I don't think it matters, because I just called Century 21 and for $200 I can take a real estate course in 5 Saturdays, then take the state test.  So I'm teasing Heather.  I kind of want to move out there and bleed rent out of her (and live with her and take turns running on the treadmill we'll buy so we get super skinny).  If I teach out there I can buy a house for half what the market value is.  I just have to teach there 3 years.  I've been actually plonking my butt down and writing some of the book I always said I would write.  Not to get ahead of the game and jinx it, but how awesome would it be to write a book that people actually spent money on?  And get a royalty check for years and years if people liked it!  I want my book to be really good.  So far I'm loosely basing it on this guy I know from the Middle East (Chris) only in my book the guy likes to hang out with the girl a lot more than Chris bothered to hang out with me.  I've just killed off his parents.  I will tell you the rest later.  No, actually, you gotta buy it.  But I'll give you a steep discount.  I told Heather that I want to paint a room in my house pale pink.    I didn't tell her about the bondage lair in the basement, where we will chain men that we want to have sex with from time to time.  California kind of sucks, kind of rocks.  Miss you guys!

      So I thought it would be a good idea to take a real estate course here and then get a license for CA.  I finally got on the Community College website here, and although the class hasn't started yet, it is filled to capacity.  Grrrrrr...  And I heard it was only $36, but I don't know that.  I'm sitting here trying not to smoke.  It's hard.  Not feeling to good about life right now.  If I meet a man, though, you know I'll be on top of the world.  I was thinking about writing to Jerome at the Al Ain Intercon.  I was going to send him a naughty, flirty, come visit me in LA note.  Think he would get really scared?  Or just get a huge ego?  I just want him to e-mail me and have cyber sex.    My Dubai girlfriends are going to Greece soon.  Am soooooooo jealous.  I wish I were rich.  It really seems like rich people don't have problems.  It's amazing.  Ah, update on Grandma.  I said, "Hi Grandma" to her the other day.  So she said, "Hi Grandma" right back.  OK.  I told her that we should change her dress since it was the same one she has worn for the last 4 days.  OK.  So she takes the dress off in front of the huge living room window.  Something is very wrong.  But they keep telling us she doesn't have Alzheimer's.  Her hygiene is gone.  Doesn't care about showers or brushing her teeth, but she gets around walking just fine.  It's frustrating!  Anyway, I rang some people up and we're gonna have a caregiver come in on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.  Not a nurse, just someone to help Grandma bathe and do her laundry.  That's all for now, kids.

      The highlight of today: take Grandma to the hairdresser's  My computer has a virus, which is affecting how often I post.  I apologize for not being very entertaining.  Aroun isn't talking to me anymore.  Our love is dead.  I am sad but I think it's only because I want him to want me, not really that I want him really badly.  I want someone awesome to go out with.  Interesting, smart, regular paycheck, over 5'10".  Is it too much to ask?  Oh, and that person living within an hour's commute would be a huge plus.  I am mad depressed.  I need a job.  I got bills to pay.    I'm think about writing a book about Portuguese pirates that infiltrated Oman.  Ooops, now someone is going to steal my idea.  Shit.  I want to be creative.  I want to make money.  I want to have a cigarette in a restaurant at the finish of my meal.  Fuck Southern California.  I look like shit or I would try to go get a modeling job.  I have to get my skin cleared up and lacquer on some self-tan.  I want a Coke.  And some cocaine.  I'm bored, lonely, depressed, and poor.  Waaaah!

      Today I drove my step-grandfather to L.A.  It's about 75 minutes from here, so not too bad.  We met up with his lawyer friend Cindy.  She has a 7-year-old (going on 8, thank you very much) and she's about to go get a Chinese baby.  At this point in the story, I know that Heather is cringing and gagging.  I know.  I know.  Anyway, we had a good time at the Proud Bird.  It's a restaurant in L.A. next to the airport.  They have old tin cans, oops, I mean planes, all around the joint with marble slabs telling the stories of when and where these planes were flown.  My step-G likes it because he can walk around and lecture us on the WW II planes.  Actually, it was pretty interesting.  What was even more interesting was realizing that I am in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  It was a buffet, ya'll.  I ate pigs in blankets, pasta salad, b-b-q ribs, cheesecake, and anything else that looked like it would pile my lipo right back on.  My grandmother is walking around the house again, checking all of the locks.  It is so annoying.  This is the third time tonight.  About half an hour ago she accidentally set the burglar alarm off.  We cancelled it within a minute, but what we didn't know is that the alarm company called her stepson.  We found out 3 minutes ago when he came to the front door.  He lives ten miles away.  Aww, what a sweet guy to drive over and check on us.  I feel like a loser now.  Grandma just stood there, looking pleased with herself to have caused a commotion.    My stepgrandfather nearly sprinted out of the house today, and he's 84.  G-ma has definitely driven him nuts over the past few months.  He kept looking at me and saying really cheerfully, "I'm on vacation!"  He's been retired since the 70s.    Anyway, I am living it up here.  They got brand new cushy leather sofas.  I have the American Express card for gas and unlimited internet access.  Life is sweet.  If only G-ma would stop sneaking up on me.  She is super suspicious of me and just stares and stares.  Next time I'm gonna say boo.  Write to me!

      I wrote a blog earlier and it got deleted!  So sad.  It wasn't that interesting, though.  I'm in Palmdale now and I hate to say that I'm quite depressed.  I need my randy girls to cheer me up.  My grandmother is in serious decline.  She has no idea what time it is.  She started cooking lunch at 9 this morning.  We caught her too late.  I washed 4 huge loads of her laundry yesterday (no one had been bothering to wash them for her, and she has 2 house cleaners that come in 3 times a week).  The way she has all her clothes thrown around, though, there is almost no way to tell what is dirty without sniffing it.  So yesterday I spent some time unraveling about 150 pairs of G-ma's hose.  She throws them all into the washer together, apparently.  Then they get tangled and she tries to rip a pair out of the ball when she needs them.  Insanity.  My stepgrandfather is here for the moment, but he flies out tomorrow.  He had skin from his ear put on the end of his nose because the doc chopped a bit off do to skin cancer.  What is absolutely hilarious about this is that his ears are really hairy, so now he has gray whiskers popping out of the tip of his nose.    This is the news from the asylum.  Please e-mail me and relieve my psychotic boredom.  Love, Kat

      Today was a great day!  My cargo shipment arrived from Abu Dhabi, so Momster and I went out to Cargo City Sud and jumped through the hoops (sign a paper, pay 15.42 euros, get a government stamp, convince a man to go load my stuff on a forklift, put all four huge boxes in the small truck we rented for the day).  Anyway, we left the house at 9:30 in the morning and I had my stuff at home in Germany by 12:30.  Getting all my crap up two flights of stairs and then up a spiral staircase was no easy task, but I shooed my mom off to work and I hauled all of that mess upstairs.  I am LOVING my room right now.  I’m never coming out.  I’ve got my big TV, DVD player, cute little silver and seafoam stereo, all my clothes, my cool Arab crap like my little framed woven rug, and all kinds of stuff that’s just been around me this last happy year.  It really feels like my space now.  The only problem is that I have no real place to put my clothes.  It’s driving me crazy.  Some are on a free-standing rack and some are in the world’s tiniest wardrobe.  Most of them are in a pile on the floor.    I’m listening to a CD I found.  I asked Aroun to burn a CD for me.  It’s all French songs.  These are all about sad, lost loves.  Or at least  I think they are.  I don’t really know what they’re saying.  I pretend a lot of the time and just say, “Bien Sur!”  or “Tiens!” from time to time.  Anyway, after I was reunited with my shit, my mom threw a dinner party.  She does that kind of thing really well.  We all sat around drinking a lot of wine and stuffing our faces.  After appeasing the old people, I went out with my mom’s gay colleague’s boyfriend.  We went to a bar and talked about the best ways to make money.  I drank full calorie Coca Cola and smoked.  It felt good.  Hell, I was in a German bar.  He drank a nasty looking beer.  So I was kept busy for most of the day, which made me happy.  I also vacuumed the floor.  As the floor in our apartment is basically blue felt, everything stays on the surface and SHOWS.  If there is a little white cat hair or a fleck of black lint, there might as well be a spotlight on it.  So I did the mad housewife thing and vacuumed to within an inch of my life.  I was sweating and EXHAUSTED by the end of it.  And there is still cat hair, which pisses me off like you would not believe.  I think my mother gave up on this carpet a long time ago.  So it got pretty bad before I attacked it.  I swear I think I was starting to go bonkers over how crap it looked.  Maybe I’m beginning to cross over to obsessive compulsive, because I vacuumed more space more thoroughly than is really healthy for a person to do.  Isn’t it absolutely riveting to read about my vacuuming?  I guess you could be watching people sleep on a reality TV show.  But at least here you get to comment.  I go back to England on the 8th.  Have I mentioned that I am missing my favorite DVD?  It’s called Venus Beauty Institute and it’s French.  I’m pretty confident that it is at David’s house.  God damn it.  It’s 30 bucks to replace it in the states.  I guess I’ll e-mail him to get it back.  Doesn’t matter.  I have to give him a sweatshirt and a pair of shorts, anyway.  xxx

       I’m alive.  And I didn’t murder my mother!  Italy was beautiful.  We went to Siena, this really old Gothic city that used to rival Florence in every way, and from there we went to Assisi.  The best thing about Siena was going to San Domenico and seeing the 700+ year-old finger of dead Saint Catherine.  Her little gray, shriveled finger is held upright in a glass dome.  Her head is in that church, too, but we couldn’t find it.  My mom thinks it was behind this sort of curtained window thing, but I’m not sure.  In Assisi we stayed at this really cute family-run hotel.  The waiter was dead hot and he smiled this really goofy smile at me all the time.  We went to the big cathedral that has huge paintings of Saint Francis’s life all over the interior.  The landscape in front of the surrounding the cathedral is BREATHTAKING.  I have never seen such beautiful country.  No wonder Tuscany is so well known for it’s scenery.  I searched so hard for some leather slides and a nice wallet, but there wasn’t anything I liked!  I couldn’t believe it.  I was in the land of leather and couldn’t find anything that wasn’t stamped Jack Daniel’s No. 7 or covered in ridiculous buckles.  I hate buckles and studs on clothes and accessories.  When is that crap going to go out of style?  The worst thing about the Italy trip was being in the f***ing car.  I think I was in the car every day except one for five hours or more.  It sucked.  And my mom kept b****ing about having to do all the driving.  I was like, “Mom, my driving license is in Arabic and you never added me to your car insurance.  If I hit someone I’m going to jail!”  At one of the several guest houses we stayed in, I managed to get bitten by the most vicious little bugs on earth.  I have a big nasty bite on each butt cheek, one on my back, five on my right arm, two on my left arm, and others that I haven’t found yet.  They’re itchy and pink and gross.  My mother wasn’t as tasty as me, so they left her alone.  I tried on my wedding gown last night.  It’s too long for me.  Otherwise, it’s beautiful.  I wish I could have zipped it up the back (it fit well, but I couldn’t reach it to zip it).  I thought it would make me sad about my lost wedding day, but it didn’t.  I am so relieved that I don’t have to go through with that.  I’m selling my life on ebay.  But the internet here at my house has gone psychotic.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.  It annoys me.  I’m selling my old videos, DVDs, some books, some clothes, and all my Wedgwood china.  I need money, I need money.  I bet I end up working at McDonald’s in L.A.  I still get nice e-mails from Aroun.  He says he is not chasing women, just leading a secluded life in Al Ain.  He’s doing his real estate stuff, thinking about switching his job to one based in Abu Dhabi, and teaching.  He’s going back to France in late June.  Just think, if things had been different he might have attended my wedding.

      Hi Guys, I wrote out a long blog today, saved it on my computer to post when the internet got up and running in my house again, and then my computer decided to throw a temper tantrum.  So now I'm blog-less, on my mother's computer, and typing this sad excuse for an update.  Just for fun, and since I told Aroun, "No, you may not have the url for my blog.  Why do you want it?  Were you reading the old blog and then I stopped typing on it and now you want the new url?  Why are you asking NOW?  You figured the old one out and read it, didn't you?  DIDN'T YOU???"  You know, I should learn my lesson and not post my dirty laundry.  But it just feels so good.  Like confession.  Aroun never admitted to knowing the old blog address, but he might have looked at my history on my computer at sometime I wasn't looking.  He graciously accepted my declining to give him the new blog address.  Men, contrary to popular belief, do like to read gossip.  The catch is that is has to be about  them.   Anyway, the just for fun bit.  I'm going to pick out some of his e-mails to me and let you read them.  Just so you can see how intermittently smitten/indifferent/foreign/rude/gracious he can be.    It's a lot of French, but you can get the gist of it.  Incidentally, the folder I keep these tidbits in is called "Frog Man".  April 20 in my (French) encyclopaedia, mary (sp.) cassatt is listed as "peintre impressionniste américaine". i don't feel ashamed of not knowing her. she for sure hadn't made great impression in france though an "impressionniste". but i'm gonna log on the website you mentionned. and let you know my impression.  i didn't go to dubai. after coming back from uaeu, i couldn't move an inch. i'm exhausted from antibiotics. too bad for the 3 consuls who invited me (the 3 stooges). dinner cost was : 300dh/pax. i'll ask if there were lobster, foie gras, caviar and champagne...  i will not sleep with c. no chance. she is not "mon amour". i know what i'm saying. so khalas! forget it.  i wish i had more energy to meet your needs. right now i'm crumbling down till i regenerate (phoenix kind). masha'allah.  enjoy yourself.  aroun  "je t'aime" = i love you "je t'aime bien" = i like you "je t'adore" = i love you with very much   April 30 hello la miss du khayal,  j'avais oublié la pool party du hilton. je n'y suis plus retourné depuis janvier 2001!! avant ça, je n'en manquais aucune. il y avait des gogo dancers? et le pakistanais who pours 10 bottles of champagne on himself? mike lynch t'a payé tes consommations? est-il plus généreux que moi? al ain scene sucks.  tu es à dubai. tu me diras si ce samedi, jour du prophète, les bars et dicos sont ouverts. à al ain, ce samedi, ce sera ville morte...  le cinéma, ça me donne mal aux yeux; je ne viendrai pas avec vous. même si angelina jolie a de grosses lèvres (bon pour les pipes, ça). btw i've seen that movie already on the plane. the first half isn't good at all. rather stupid. the snd half is ok and the end... melodramaaaaatikos!!  je vais te faire un cd de chansons françaises mais alors n'oublie pas de m'enregistrer quelques unes de tes vidéos sur ma clé usb, please!  "une bite" (pas "bit") wanna taste a bit of ma bite?  "tu es un con" (you're a jerk) ("con" originally means "cunt" - if that doesn't bother you to use a part of the holy female body as an insult) / "tu es con" (you're being a jerk)  bises, aroun   May 27 Hi Kaaaatherine!! I bumped on Arun. He says hello and asked me about your whereabouts. The guy knows everything, for sure. But he's a good guy and know what to keep for himself. He gave me info on other people I know. Went to aerobic's this morning. Had a great workout then. The sun shines here... as always. Are you lost in les Alpes? Not arrived yet in Tuscany? Hugs and kisses aroun  May 31 hey katherine, tu as le bonjour d'omar de la réception. you told him a lot about you. he gave me your complete resume. your planned wedding in UK, your missing father("chouh yani hathah? not good situation"), etc. seems that you spent some time talking to him. chris left tonight. i said good-bye to him. i'm reading your "almost french" book. interesting. do US banks lend money easily? maybe the fact that you're going to be a teacher (stable work) will help. i'll answer your letter tomorrow. kiss you good night, aroun  There, this long post should keep you working girls entertained for a little while at least!   I'll post more soon.  I hope you are doing great.    And remember... If you don't have anything nice to say about anyone, then come sit by me.

      Did you see Legends of the Fall?&nbsp; Remember when Anthony Hopkins has a huge stroke and can't talk anymore and his face is falling sideways?&nbsp; Remember when he has a slate tied around his neck and writes all crookedly and pathetically on it?&nbsp; Remember when his son comes home after years away and he writes "Am Happy" on the slate and everybody bursts into tears of pity and joy?&nbsp; That's me.&nbsp; I'm happy.&nbsp; Grandma has laughed several times, Tom is in good spirits, I am immensely enjoying my job, I'm going shopping tomorrow, we're having 9 for dinner on Saturyday night, and I Am Happy.&nbsp; I haven't been really, really happy in quite a while, and the feeling feels good.  Plus, I'm going to go to Santa Clarita tomorrow and buy stuff for my new place.&nbsp; Tabish is going to come meet me after work.&nbsp; I think he really is a sweety.&nbsp; I have had my hair cut and ironed flat, I am wearing gorgeous make-up, my mom sent me a bunch of my cute clothes in a box from Germany, and I have a steady (fun) job.&nbsp; Don't I just make you want to wretch with my happiness?&nbsp;   I have also lost a lot of weight.&nbsp; I'm down to 168, as of yesterday, which is only 5 pounds over the minimum weight that I had when I was strictly following Weight Watchers.&nbsp; I'm just seriously not that interested in food anymore.&nbsp; I've been kind of depressed recently, and nothing but wine has tasted very good.  Anyway, my car insurance came through, I'm going to hang out with my guy friend Tabish (who I am learning how to be cool from), and I'm moving out of my grandparents' house.&nbsp; All systems are go.&nbsp; Be happy for me!

      This job is so much better than shoe hell.&nbsp; Today I unwrapped lipsticks, tried out the new lipstick colors, learned the different types of foundations, learned the names of the three big Estee Lauder models, cleaned the counters, saw the amazing spa room where we give relaxing mini-facials, and talked with nice women.&nbsp; Oh yeah, we served some customers, too.  And when I got home, my back wasn't aching and my feet weren't swollen and painful.&nbsp; I really needed to get out of shoe hell.  Also, my employee discount is effective immediately.&nbsp; I don't have to wait 30 days like I would have had to wait at Dillard's.&nbsp; And I can go outside on my break.&nbsp; The only funny thing is that I'm working at the men's store.&nbsp; Gottschalks has two buildings in the mall.&nbsp; The women's store, and the men's store.&nbsp; My counter is with several other (inferior) make-up counters at the men's store.&nbsp; And guess what.&nbsp; A man came and bought some shit today.&nbsp; For his woman.&nbsp; He did what we told him to do, buy two, and he never asked the price, just handed over the cash when the total was announced.&nbsp; Isn't that a kick in the pants?  Ooooohhh, and just when I never thought it was going to happen, Tabish called me.&nbsp; I gave my number to another guy, so I thought it was him, but NO!&nbsp; It was Tabish.&nbsp; I was stunned.&nbsp; He said he was sorry he didn't call me earlier.&nbsp; A friend of their family died on Saturday and was buried Sunday.&nbsp; The daughter of the man who died was grief-stricken and his visiting aunt and uncle went to the funeral with them and everything.&nbsp; Sadness.&nbsp; But anyway, I feel happy again.&nbsp; It's nice to feel wanted.&nbsp; And he's pretty cool.&nbsp; I like him.&nbsp; Now if I could only get him to drag his sorry ass up here.  Oh, because I thought Tabish dumped me, I started writing to this other guy.&nbsp; His is a sicko!&nbsp; In an interesting way.&nbsp; He wants to have phone sex.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; Maybe after I move.  Hmmm, we have a new caregiver coming in to sort out my Grandma.&nbsp; And we had a contractor around to look at ripping out her bathtub and putting&nbsp;a flat shower in the bathroom instead.  A local principal called me today to tell me that there is a 6th grade teacher opening at a local school (not his, he is fully staffed).&nbsp; However, he got my application when I sent it a couple of weeks ago and he told me to tell the other school's principal that he sent me over.&nbsp; So it sounds like something might pan out here.  I work tomorrow at 9.&nbsp; For once, I'm looking forward to it.

      OK, so tomorrow is my first day selling make-up to women who have a lot of money.&nbsp; I'd rather be shopping.  Grandma is OK.&nbsp; Tom is OK.&nbsp; I just found out that my step-aunt (the one with the posh accent) and her husband (the talkative money-making machine) are coming to see us next weekend.&nbsp; They live in London most of the time.&nbsp; So anyway, I have to get Grandma to act a little bit more sane and clean this place up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, real groceries (not just cantaloupes and cartons of old milk) may need to be purchased.&nbsp;   Tabish talked to me on the phone on Friday, but I haven't hear from him since.&nbsp; This has made me sad.&nbsp; I'm trying to keep myself busy so that I don't think about the rejection and get depressed...  I wrote to another hot guy on the dating site I like.&nbsp; Let's see if he bites.&nbsp; He's made hot compared to Tabz.&nbsp; But Tabz was fun and had cool stories to tell.&nbsp; Sadness.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want him because he doesn't want me!&nbsp; Oh well, there are other fish on plenty of fish.com  I took Tom to see my new house in Santa Clarita today.&nbsp; He liked it.&nbsp; Then we tried to go to a state park and see some snakes, but a fire burned the whole place down and when we got there it was charred ruins.&nbsp; A big sign was posted that said DO NOT ENTER.&nbsp; Not that we would have.  I'm excited about Estee Lauder.&nbsp; I will tell you how it goes!

      Because of funny e-mails like these:  Hey girl, I'm watching the Wizard of Oz.&nbsp; That neighbor lady who turns into the wicked witch is one stone-cold bitch. Destroy poor toto?&nbsp; Fuck her.  Yeah, eharmony is cool, but damn expensive.&nbsp; They've found me about 8 matches, but no one worth paying money to hear more about.&nbsp; They keep matching me with really outgoing types and I know I would not be into that.&nbsp;   How is the job hunt working out?&nbsp; did you have your interview yet?I can't wait to move back to Richmond in Aug.&nbsp; My parents are making me insane(r).  I'm volunteering at the legal aid place in Tappahannock.&nbsp; Poor people have lots of legal problems. Bye

      Dear Sweet Saints, Look at this DISGUSTING e-mail I just got.&nbsp; It's from a guy who uses the roommate finding service that I use.&nbsp; Ick, Ick, Ick.&nbsp; He just wants a Ho, not a roommate.&nbsp; And I looked at his pics and he is REVOLTING.&nbsp; If you want to see them, go to  urlLink www.roommateaccess.com .&nbsp; He's rdmmoyer  Are you still looking for a roommate? Would you like to live in Long Beach, California? Please check out my profile and contact me at: “rdmmoyer@dslextreme.com“. You may also call me at: 562-436-8888. I’m looking forward to meeting you. Roy. >>>>>>>>>>>> My profile: Here is free rent for the right woman. There are a lot of amenities that come with this apartment. Free rent, free food, free utilities, free basic sundries, free phone service, free cable TV, parking, and free moving service. I am a decent, sincere, honest, hardworking, and financially secure man hoping to find a mutually beneficial relationship with a female roommate. Must supply a photo and basic background check. Drugs and disease free, no smoking, and a private quiet life style are the requirements. I do like to have fun! Theme parks and tourist stuff in S.Calif, dinners, movies, theater, biking, hiking, camping, skating, swimming, long drives to points of interest, sitting at a desk and reading and studying interesting stuff, long walks at a rapid pace, eating ice cream and popcorn and drinking wine and beer, and of course - quiet companionship in an intimate place. I would prefer to have a Hispanic female roommate so she can make me fluent in Spanish, or an Asian female roommate just because I love Asian females. Actually I am looking for a sweet, sincere, honest, fun, and temperate roommate of any race or background. This will be interesting for both of us.

      Oh my God, I almost gagged when I read that "cat vomit between your toes" thing, Ash.&nbsp; That  is  BAD!&nbsp; It reminded me of this time that I was staying over at M&M's house.&nbsp; We heard this weird sound of stomping in a squidy puddle, and then the next thing we know, S is yelling, "No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Ca!&nbsp; Ca!&nbsp; Gross! Nasty! No!"&nbsp; Turns out, toddler Wasfi had found a puddle of cat vomit and was stomping his cute little toddler boot in it to watch it squirt out everywhere.&nbsp;   I had a job interview with LA Unified School District yesterday.&nbsp; They told me that the area I want to teach in (the affordable north) is the one that has the least demand for teachers (because they all want to live in the affordable north).&nbsp; Plus they want some documents that I don't have because I tossed most of my student teaching junk when I graduated.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like I'll get a teaching job somewhere around here.&nbsp; What's annoying is that they call certified teachers "certificated" which sounds about as&nbsp;dumb as saying, "we conversated" instead of "we conversed".&nbsp;   But then I did something that I knew I would be advised against by all of you, but which turned out fine in the end.&nbsp; Remember Tabish?&nbsp; I went to Irvine to meet him.&nbsp; After my interview I drove an hour south to this nice mall.&nbsp; He called me a dozen times to make sure I was finding it alright and then he came over to the mall from work.&nbsp; We met at a department store (see how safe?&nbsp; public, lots of people around).&nbsp; He hugged me right away, which I thought was sweet.&nbsp; But of course I was all nervous and backed off severely after that.&nbsp; We met up at six.&nbsp; Then we got in his BMW and drove over to a bar where we drank Sangria and smoked and talked about our Dubai experiences.&nbsp; He's funny.&nbsp; And he thinks I'm funny.&nbsp; And I think I caught him looking at me with the "you're lovely" kind of look that guys sometimes give when they're drunk.&nbsp; Anyway, I pointed out that it was 8 and I told G-ma I'd be home by nine and there was no way I was going to get all the way home in an hour.&nbsp; So he drove me back to the mall and I told him next time I'd buy him the drink.&nbsp; And he said, "Time how long it takes you to get back!"&nbsp; Which made me think that he wants to come up to Palmdale to see me and wants to know how long it takes to get there, but I could be wrong.&nbsp; I haven't talked to him since I saw him yesterday.&nbsp; I'm gonna make him call first.&nbsp;   He talks so Californian.&nbsp; He says "like" and "i'll hit you up later" and uses acronyms that it takes me 20 to logically decipher.  He's not so cute that girls are fighting each other for him, but he has good clothing sense and does his hair cool and has a nice smile.&nbsp; His mouth is disconcertingly wide.&nbsp; I'm worried about how I could kiss it properly, but I don't think I'll have to worry about that for a while.&nbsp; Anyway, I like him and he seems really fun and I want to go hang out at the beach with him.&nbsp; He goes to the beach ALL the time.  Best of all, he has two degrees, which I totally love about him.&nbsp; One in econ and one in computer science.&nbsp; And he likes math.&nbsp; He had his own apartment, but he moved back home two months ago.&nbsp; He's looking for a better job than the one he has now.&nbsp; Aren't we all?  Tomorrow I'm working just 4 hours (thank God) and I'm getting my car fixed.&nbsp; The driver's side window decided to roll itself down, but not up.  Oh, I don't think I've told you about my job.&nbsp; I hate it and I'm quitting.&nbsp; Here's more:  oh my god.&nbsp; i've been working in the ladies' shoes department.&nbsp; it's AWFUL.&nbsp; i'm gonna be so nice to those shoe-selling people from now on.&nbsp; people come in and DESTROY the place.&nbsp; it's so frustrating.&nbsp; but some people come in and are so easy and pleasant (and know what they want) and drop a grip of cash.&nbsp; anyway, i'm quitting on monday, i think.&nbsp; i just got offered a new job selling make-up in a rival department store, so i'm going to dump this crap job and stop running around a concrete floor in search of the ugliest shoes on earth.&nbsp; i'm going to stand around like a zombie and plaster over people's wrinkles instead.&nbsp; until i get a teaching job.&nbsp; that has remained elusive for the moment.  i'm still doing real estate class.&nbsp; i should study more, but crap shoe job got in the way.&nbsp; i'm working fewer hours at estee lauder, so i can do what i really want to do which is become a fire breathing real estate agent.  i get PAID tomorrow.&nbsp; it's going to be such a struggle to not buy these cute shoes and get a pedicure and new highlights (see how greedy i am?)&nbsp; but i already made up my mind that 75% of everything i earn is going to pay off the visa.&nbsp; i don't want that stupid thing hanging over my head.  i'm planning to move to this city called santa clarita soon.&nbsp; aug. 1st is the intended date.&nbsp; i can't wait.&nbsp; and my mom is rolling in from germany, so i'm looking forward to that around mid-august.&nbsp; what are you doing lately? &nbsp;&nbsp; talk to you later!!! kat

      Grandma is doing A-OK.  She's eating, walking, relaxed.  It's a relief.  Had a male nurse come to care for her wound today.  Sounds sexy, but he wasn't.  Got my Real Estate book today.  It's HUGE.  So I get to read chapters 1-4 before Saturday.  The guy teaching the class is a big burly black man.  He looks like such a thug!  He's really articulate and owns the real estate brokerage, so he's a man with a plan.  I want to be like him when I grow up.  Minus the gold chain.  I start working tomorrow (Amen, Amen).  The balance in my bank account is humorously low.  Am stalking an internet guy who is spending the rest of the summer touring South America.  Then he's coming up to LA and wants to meet me.  His personal ad said "I hate gold-diggers."  Sounds like an announcement that he has money, to me!  Oh well, he doesn't need to know that I'll run a credit check on him if it gets serious.  That's normal, right?  Step-grandfather Tom is back soon.  Everyone is looking forward to it!  Then I am goint to start seriously apartment-hunt.

      This morning I woke up to the sound of breaking glass.  I didn't think much about it; I just assumed Grandma dropped a glass in the sink or something.  Five minutes later, I walked down the hallway and into the kitchen.  In the middle of the floor was my Grandma, lying absolutely still.  I thought she was gone.  She was so quiet.  Blood and broken glass were all over the floor.  She had dropped the coffee pot and fallen.  Her glasses were outside the kitchen, on the living room carpet.  I ran over and shook her shoulder.  "Grandma!"  She turned her head, thank God, and looked up at me.  "I'm fine," she said.  I ran over and got the phone and dialled 911.  I have never had to call 911 before.  I told them my Grandmother fell down and was bleeding.  They immediately switched me over to the fire department and I had to tell them our address, Grandma's condition, etc.  I had to find out where she was bleeding and apply pressure.  I thought it was her head, but she just had blood on the floor near her head.  It was her wrist that was bleeding.  I will never figure out how she got blood everywhere from that one single cut.  She must have fallen, still holding the coffee pot, and sliced her wrist with the glass when it smashed.  I put pressure on the wrist, but it was already clotting and bleeding very little, so I left the cloth on it and started running around like a mad woman.  I turned off the alarm so we could open the front door when the paramedics arrived.  I went ahead and threw the front door open so they could just walk in when they got here.  I was wearing the stupidest short little white nightie, but I wasn't going to run change and leave Grandma abandoned so they could walk in and think I wasn't attending to her needs.  So when the big, burly hunks of men came in, that's how they found us.  Me in my little-girl-nightie, kneeling next to my crumpled Grandmother (complete with her nightshirt on inside-out), in the midst of broken glass and pools of blood.  We got the full she-bang.  Fire engine, support truck, and ambulance.  They did all of Grandma's vital stats and everything was normal.  The house was flooded with hot men and Grandma was answering questions about what year she was born and what she was doing when she fell.  I ran to put real clothes on.  They loaded her onto a stretcher, bandaged her wrist, and asked me, "Is she usually out of it after she falls?"  I had to snicker.  She's always out of it.  She has dementia or is entering dementia, however you want to say it.  But the doctors haven't labeled her.  We think was made her fall was low blood pressure.  When she stands up or first wakes up it gets pretty low.  But when we ask her if she was lightheaded when she fell, she just says she doesn't know.  So I followed them to the hospital at 8:30 (this all started at 8).  We met with the doctor, he asked her questions, she gave him false answers, I corrected them.  We did blood tests and a CAT scan.  Nothing is wrong with her!  Yeah, right.  We got discharged at 12:45.  My first real estate class was today.  Should have been from 9-1.  I called them after I had been at the hospital and asked them to leave a note for the teacher so he would know why I didn't show.  Anyway, she got the all clear and I drove her home.  We're here now.  She has been resting a lot.  She had a big day, to say the least.

      I had forgotten how much I detest traffic lights.  Oh my God.  As soon as you get going, another one turns red, and you get to wait.  It happened to me like 50 times today.  I now appreciate the genius of heart-attack-inducing round-abouts.  Today I lived like a housewife.  Went to the library and dry cleaners in the morning to drop off stuff, then came home to fix granny a nutritious lunch.  Pasta, boiled carrots, and an Orea.  Then I went to look at a room for rent.  The guy that owns the place is a trucker and is hardly ever there, but his out-of-work girlfriend is there all the time.  Looked really nice on the inside, but I can't deal with the girlfriend.  Then I went to the DMV.  Turns out they don't do the SMOG check there.  I could have screamed.  I thought she told me to bring the car in for the verification AND the smog.  No, she meant for me to take it somewhere private for the smog.  So then I paid for my plates, got an oil change, got the smog check (which cost $60 and took 45 minutes in a hell hole of a concrete shack with a broken recliner in it) and then got the privilege of buying my only Palmdale friend a shower gift for her wedding.  Only JC Penney did not have ONE FUCKING THING that was on her three page registry.  So I got her a gift card, the most thoughtless gift one can give.  Whatever.  At least she can spend it how she wants.  Tomorrow starts real estate school and Bekah's shower.  I was excited before, but now I'm just exhausted.

      I can't believe it.  Ashkan is the guy I met through M & M and went clubbing with in Dubai.  Tabish is the guy I met online who calls me sometimes (and I will eventually meet because I find him tall, dark and handsome).  Tabish knows Ashkan.  From high school.  Through a mutual friend who lived in Ashkan's neighborhood.  How weird is that??!!  They both live in Irvine.  Now I'm taking Granny out to lunch, to get our hair done at JC Penney (tres chic) and then I'm kidnapping her to go to the doctor.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm nervous.

      So today Grandma called me on my cell phone to wake me up (she had already been in my room 3 times and told me, "Don't you think you outta get up now?").  I told her to piss off in a nice way.  Then, on the phone, she goes, "Just checking!"  GAH-- GRR!!  Then I made her a nutritious lunch.  An hour later I caught her with Orea cookie crumbs all over her face.  I'm still tutoring the guys from the water company.  They like their math lessons, I think.  Philip is so thrilled to now understand how to change parts per million to parts per billion.  They're the oldest students I ever had, but the pleasure of seeing them "get it" is the same as when I see a 10-year-old grasp fractions.  We agreed they'd pay me 10 dollars an hour.  So last night when I left, they put some bills in my hand and we all said our pleasantries.  When I got home and unfolded them to put them in my wallet, I found they had given me $40.  Can you imagine?  I must look so pathetic and jobless!    But guess what!  Today I GOT A JOB.  I'm going to work at Dillards for slightly more than 10 dollars an hour.  I'm so relieved.  I'm starting part time, but they say that there are lots of hours to be had so I might be working quite a bit more than 20 hours a week.  Plus it's 10% commission, so I could potentially be taking home quite a haul.  Then again, I might hate it.  Dealing with people's feet in the shoe department isn't exactly glamorous, but at least I'll get to talk to people all day!  I'm trying out a bar-b-q salmon recipe for dinner tonight.  We'll see if G-ma appreciates it more than the shrimp.  I couple of nights ago I slaved over it, she ate two shrimp, said she didn't like them, and threw them away.  I could have smothered her with a pillow!  My real estate course starts Saturday morning.  I am madly excited about that.  And I talked to my Iranian friend Ashkan!  He was working so we didn't talk long, but he was so sweet and polite and I said I would see his praises to Manar and Manal.  I might drive down to Irvine to go out to lunch with him soon.  He's going to Italy in early August, so I have to get my butt down there.  Irvine is also where Tabish lives...  Good excuse to drop by and see him??  Go see Ashkan, go see Tabish, get my male company fix?  I miss everyone!  Please comment.

      Watching the time rollin' away.  So my new dream is to work the Estee Lauder counter.  And sell real estate...  And meet a rich, handsome man.  Actually, I just like men that adore me.  That's what I want.  A man who says random, sincere, adrenaline-rushing compliments.  Who is in awe of my beauty and wit.  This means that I have to find a man who is incurably insane, but no matter.  What is everyone doing for the 4th of July?  I'm going over to Bekah's house.  I think there is going to be red meat and prayer.  I won't stay very long if that's all there is, I can tell you that for free.  There better be some dangerous firecrackers and kids with matches.  I need the entertainment.  I weigh less than I've weighed in a looooonnnnnnggggg time.  My lowest weight after Weight Watchers was 163.  I ballooned up as high as 188 afterward, but now I'm back down to 171.  Now that I know I'm thinner again, I'm watching my food.  Which makes me want to eat more of it.  I think I'll go back to ignoring what I was eating and throwing away whatever tasted like crap (mainly vegetables).  That seemed to be working.  I would love to weigh 150.  I looked amazing when I weighed 150.  Please Lord, let me weigh 150.  So I can get a rich, crazy husband and fly first class.  You guys will be the first to know if I get my navy Estee Lauder smock and key to the counter glass.

      Whats up Kat? What a clever girl....Rusty is my nickname, got it back in high school. My real name is Tabish. It's a persian name that means "a ray of sunshine." Kinda random, dont know where my parents came up with it since they are not persian, think they wanted something unique. Its a little difficult for some people to pronounce so I just go by Rusty, but my close friends call me by my real name. I figure its not worth wasting my time correcting people if theyre going to forget it by the next time or if there is a next time.   The education of Arab women seems like an interesting subject to do research on. Was it just in the UAE or other countries aswell? Was it for school or just on your own that you decided to do this? I bet its very hot; Im glad I went in January when the weather was very pleasant. My friend that I went to go visit there just came home for the summer, but I still havent had a chance to kick it with him. Sorry but dont know what Fulbright is?   Im going up to San Francisco in about an hour to with my family to spend the fourth of july with relatives and have a bbq. Kinda wanted to stay here to celebrate my birthday but its been a while since my whole family has taken a trip together so I figure its not too much of a sacrific. Itll make them happy so its the least I can do for all they have done for me. Its just that car ride up there with my parents....dont know how thats gonna be; its been a long time since Ive been on a road trip with them. Cant smoke my cigarettes around them (out of respect sorta) and I know im gonna crave one on that long of a car ride. I know what you mean about how it is calming and soothing. Just makes you feel relaxed and relieves stress for me very well.   Is skeet shooting where they launch objects into the sky and you try to shoot them when they are air born? I have been paintballing which is a lot of fun, but never to a gun range. I know of a gun club down in Pomona; some of my friends went to check it out and they said it was a lot of fun. My mom hates guns though and even made a big deal about paintballing....LOL. Im sure they have skeet shooting down here to but no clue where that would be.   Congrads on the job. I know what you mean about getting a college degree and then feeling like it is not being put to use. But I have figured out that a college degree isnt really about applying what you learn in college, but it can be too. Got two degrees but still feels like I really havent used them. But I have finally figured out what i learned in college.... learning how to "learn" quicker and faster about something that you might have no background in. Dont know if that made sense? Dont worry though....a college degree is more of something to fall back on....now you can shoot for whatever your heart desires and just incase it doesnt work out, you always have you degree to fall back on.   But I gotta jet cuz Im leaving soon. Hope I survive the car ride...LOL.  Take Care......try not to have too many bloody mary's.  Lates Tabish

      Awww, sweetie, Im so sorry to make you sad, but work has been a bit hectic for the past week. But CHEER UP because I don’t think your a nutter....LOL., or do I have something to worry about…JUST PLAYIN. You sound like someone with some depth that Id love to have a conversation with. I am currently working full time at a company that provides psychological services to corporations and for government institutions. And then a couple nights during the week, I go to a car shop where I am an apprentice learning to weld and build race cars. I have been a bit crazy about cars for as long as I can remember. But my new thing is surfing. I love snowboarding and got so addicted to it that I had to find a supplement for the seasons without snow. Hoping for the same adrenaline rush with surfing but still not as comfortable in the sea as I am in the mountains. And I’m also hoping that it will help me quit cigarettes. Where else but California can you get the best of both worlds plus so much more with 2 completely unique cities like LA and SD so close by. LA is always fun. I think California will always be my home but there are so many different places that I want to check out and visit. Back in January, I took a 2 week vacation to a couple places. I first went to Switzerland and got a chance to go snowboarding there which was a blast. Then I went to Dubai to visit a friend who is currently going to pharmacy school there. I tried to check out some clubs out there but it was "couples" only and my friend's buddies all left to visit their families. But still had a good time over there; it is a very diverse place. Then I went to India to check it out and visit some family. It was my second time there, the first time I was a bit young so it was like my first time. It is interesting to see how people living in different parts of the world have different outlooks on life. I'm mostly indian with a bit of italian and english from my mum's side…LOL, but born and raised in Southern California. Love to travel, soo many places that I want to see, so little time. So where did you grow up? Very interesting how you went to the Middle East to do research? What were you doing research on? What places did you get to visit? Best of Luck with the job. Have a happy 4th of July..  Later Rusty

      Hi Rusty (something tells me that's not the name on your BC),  So I should ignore you for a few days and then write and sound all bored, but that's completely the opposite of my character so I'm not gonna.  I can't believe you were in Dubai in January.  That's where I lived for 8 months.  One of my college roommates lives there and my Fulbright was to the UAE.  I lived in the oasis town of Al Ain most of the time, but every other weekend I was in the paradise of Dubai.  I did research on the education of Arab women.  I haven't published anything yet, though.  It's so hot there now; I'm glad to be here instead.  I'm addicted to cigarettes.  I can't believe I did this to myself.  I'm spending like 4 dollars a day to slowly kill myself, but it's so calming and so nice to have one when I'm bored.  I really don't know how I'm going to stop.  Every time I try I get so irritable and everyone thinks I have PMS.  And now I'm getting these little lines around my mouth and I'm going to turn into an old wrinkly hag.  But I will quit.  soon.  someday.  I can't really say I do anything cool outdoors.  I go outside to smoke, but that's about it.  But I do want to jetski and I know I want to go on a skiing trip.  But I don't know if it's really because I want to ski or if it's because couples always go on skiing trips in movies and drink hot chocolate, lots of whisky, lie around on bear rugs, tumble around in the snow, and wear cute boots and hats and stuff.  I might just want to go for the drinks and wardrobe, but I'm not sure.  When I was in UAE I went skeet shooting for the first time.  I really, really liked that.  I went along with two men that were also on Fulbright and I shot three times as many pulls as they did put together.  They hated me after that.  So I'm looking for a gun club here so I can go shoot stuff.  But I know I won't join until I'm working.  I did an interview today at Gottschalks and it was hilarious.  The first woman who interviewed me had blue bangs.  It was insane.  She had big, curly brown hair, but the front was bright blue.  It must have taken her hours to bleach it and then set the blue dye.  In the interview we got off the subject and ended up talking about Weight Watchers, her being on the Depo Provera birth control shot, her upcoming tube-tying surgery, and then we discussed how I could lift a curio cabinet (never gonna happen).  Anyway, she told me she just called me because girls never write 'stock' on the applications and she wanted to get another female back there unloading trucks with her.  Fair enough.  So she liked me and called the store manager to give me the second required interview.  He talked to me for five minutes and then he told me I was a polished young lady and I didn't belong in stock.  Then he called the cosmetics manager and told her to come interview me.  Then he told me that cosmetics pays the best wages in the store and I seriously could have kissed him.  So then I talked make-up for a while and they said they'll call me in a week to tell me if I get to work the Estee Lauder counter.  I can't believe I got a college degree to work at the Estee Lauder counter, but I need a job, so whatever.  I found out my Iranian friend is in LA now!  He wrote and gave me his number but I haven't gotten to talk to him yet.  He LOVES to dance.  He's all bendy and funny on the dance floor.  When I first met him he had broken his leg and it was in a huge cast, but we still went to the club and danced.  Nothing can stop him.  I've blabbed enough.  Have a good 4th!  Kat

      I forgot to tell you who else wants my money.  CA schools sent me a thing to get my license switched over from VA to CA.  It's only $111 to get my fingerprints done, background check, and new license.  WHAT?!  No dears, you're supposed to pay me.  Ugh and Blech.  I'm sick of bleeding money.

      Today I went and signed up for the real estate course.  I was the last person admitted!  I was pissed, though, because I called them yesterday and asked if I could pay with a MasterCard.  She told me yes, that would be fine.  I show up today and they only take money orders or checks.  God damn it.  So I had to go get a 200 dollar cash advance, which is going to cost me way over 200 in the long run, but I'll be damned if I'm going to miss this course after I've been waiting like a month for it to start.  I saw another girl who came to sign up.  She was proper trash, let me tell you.  Nose ring and everything.  But I really didn't like her because I smiled at her and she didn't smile back.  Good luck selling a bird house, bitch.  Then I went to Gottschalks, a department store, for my interview.  I had written on my application that I would work as a sales rep or stockist.  So "receiving" called me and that interview went so great.  The manager, Becky, had her Weight Watchers dining out guide sitting on her desk, so I asked her if she did WW because I used to do WW and I lost 50 pounds!  She was like, yeah, I do it but I have only lost 35 and gained back 20!  So we commiserated on how hard it is to eat right.  Then this other lady showed up and they told me they just called me because girls never write stock on the applications and so they decided to interview me to get another female in.  I was getting used to the idea of working unloading stuff of of a semi when Wham!  I was called to do a second interview with the store manager.  They have you do interviews with two people before you get hired.  The manager looked me up and down, asked me why I chose Randolph-Macon Woman's College, and then he said I was a polished lady and didn't belong in stock.  So he told me that cosmetics is the best paying department in the store and asked me what brand I like.  I told him that I am an Estee Lauder devotee, so he called the EL ladies in.  Both of them were caked in make-up, which I love, and they told me there is an opening in 10 days at the Estee Lauder counter.  So, I pray to God, they will call me in a week and offer it to me.  Antelope Valley Mall isn't the most high-traffic place in the world, but I could sell the shit out of make-up.  Elena showed me how when she worked at Clinique in Reading.  But there is a lot of paperwork crap, ugh.  Anyway, I'm so glad that I got some positive reinforcement from the store manager, because I was starting to feel like a real loser.  He's no dummy, though, because he senses that I will leave Gottschalks to teach in a couple of months, which is my dream, so we'll see if I actually get hired.  I told him that no one has called me from a California school so it looks like all the positions are filled.  Maybe he'll believe it.  Now I'm back at home and the cleaning ladies are here.  I need to get a grip and realize how freaking lucky I am.  I have one credit card that is not maxed out (yet) and I live in a nice house (until step-G-pa gets back).  Things could be way worse.  I hope they keep getting better.

      So today, grandpa Tom is chatting to me on the back patio.  His daughter, Josie, just visited us this weekend, and he is disturbed at how tired and overworked she seems.  She's some sort of domestic slave, he says.  It's true, she looks tired, but I've never seen her when she wasn't cooking a huge gourmet meal or doling out wine to several guests, so anything else would seem wrong.  This is my "aunt" Josie who lives in a fabulous London home.  I aspire to have such a gorgeous home someday.  Anyway, Tom tells me that they can't afford it and they're thinking about remortgaging or moving to California.  They don't really like Cali, so this is an odd thought to get my head around.  Then, Tom shocks me.  "You know what they are really thinking.  They're waiting for me to die so they can get their inheritance."  I had to crack up.  This guy is on the ball.  He knows everybody wants a piece!  Ha ha ha.  To say that about his own kids.  Then he turns to me and squints his eyes, "I should say I think they'll be disappointed in the end."  Ha ha ha.  He's got everyone thinking he's worth a mint.  I think he's worth a little over a million.  His two kids could definitely exist comfortably on their respective shares, but I think he is very concerned that J and her husband have always lived beyond their means and they'll never have quite enough money because they spend so much constantly.  I don't know, time will tell, and if there are squabbles over money after he's gone, I know he's going to look down and chuckle at them.  I went into LA and took the ASVAB, the intelligence/aptitude test that the Army administers.  I've been thinking about joining the reserves, and my recruiter told me that if I scored high enough on the ASVAB, I could get a job with military intelligence.  Well, today I got the highest possible score one can get.  A 99.  So I'm thinking about doing a civil affairs job and enlisting.  The bitch is that basic training last 9 weeks.  I don't wanna do anything for 9 weeks, let alone anything that involves running.  If I can drop twenty pounds, cut out the cigarettes, and run a mile every other day in under 10 minutes, I'm going to enlist.  They're gonna give me money toward my student loans, which is the whole point.  Plus I'd get to shop at the commissary, get a discount on my car insurance, get an extra 200 hundred a month pay for my weekend duty, and learn Arabic on the government's dime.  Language school could last a year, though, and I'm not quite down with that.  I'm just thinking at the moment.  Estee Lauder job is still fun, fun, fun.  I sold $420 of make-up to one lady last week.  That's 12.60 commission and a happy customer for me!  My mom is coming soon and she is none too happy that I still don't have a nice, steady teaching job.  This Estee Lauder business is driving her nuts.  She didn't raise a kid to spackle over old ladies' wrinkles.  My uniform is cute.  Navy pants, white shell, beige jacket with a little gold "Estee Lauder" pin.  I like it.  And don't forget, I'm in full make-up when I'm there, so few people recognize me.  We had dinner for 10 last night.  Everybody came!  Our lawyer friend, her 8-year-old daughter (who demanded that I do her make-up, which I did and  everyone  marvelled at her beauty), my step-uncle Philip, Brit Josie, her husband, Philip's significant other, her son, Tom.  We all had a lot of fun.  And a lot of wine.  Tabish ticked me off because he said he was going to call me back and then didn't.  But then tonight he called me and as he was talking to me his car overheated.  I guess he got what was coming to him!  Anyway, he wants to go shooting with me.  I'm trying to find a range up here.  It should be fun.  Tabish is a sweetie.  And I like his car.  XXX, kat
