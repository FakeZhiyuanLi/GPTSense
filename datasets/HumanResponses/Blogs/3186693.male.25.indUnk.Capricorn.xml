       Scorcese Anyone?   A Bronx Tale... Well-written, well-directed, kudos to Palminteri and De Niro. However, it swayed away from the plot somewhere in the middle. The part where Calogero met the black girl is unnecessary in my opinion. De Niro should have left this tiny subplot to Spike Lee.  Besides that point, there is a constant Scorsese feel throughout the movie, the visually dark beginning (Mean Streets, anyone?), the music and even a bit of the camerawork. But I guess you cannot really blame De Niro for being influenced by Scorsese. This is after all, the Bronx, New York... i.e. Scorsese's playground. On top of that, be reminded that De Niro acted in a few movies by Scorsese with the relatively same theme: Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Raging Bull to name a few. De Niro even mentioned in the featurette he did not wanna adopt too much of Scorsese's style.   I guess you failed there, Bobby. But you succeeded in making a Class-A movie in your directorial debut. Salute!  Oh, I almost forgot. There is a cameo by an Oscar-winning actor, I'm not gonna reveal who. It's NOT Pacino, that's the most I can give.  "Well, sometimes in the heat of passion, the little head tells the big head what to do, and the big head should think twice about it." - De Niro in 'A Bronx Tale (1993)

       A Bronx Tale of the Devil in a Blue Dress   I just received two new dvds: 'A Bronx Tale' and 'Devil In A Blue Dress'. 'A Bronx Tale', starring Chazz Palminteri and Robert De Niro was written by Palminteri and directed by De Niro. It's about a father (De Niro) who became worried when a crime boss (Palminteri) befriends his son. Yeah, I know... when I first read the synopsis, I thought the Palminteri was the father and De Niro was the baddie too. No matter to me, what interests me is that this is De Niro directorial debut.  Anyway... I wanna watch the dvd now. Be back soon.

       The Case of the Missing DVDs   I'm finally done with my stockchecking. Check out my list of dvds that I have.  It seems a lot of my dvds are missing.

Bruce Willis: "What now?" Ving Rhames: "What now? Let me tell you what now. I'ma call a coupla hard, pipe-hittin' niggers, who'll go to work on the homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy? I ain't through with you by a damn sight. I'ma get medieval on your ass."  - Pulp Fiction (1994)

       Stockchecking   Since this morning, I've been counting and sorting my dvds in alphabetical order and displaying the list on the right side of this page that you are currently viewing. I didn't know I have so many dvds. It wasn't so obvious because most of them were loaned to my friends. But I'm not gonna stop.. no way. This is an evergrowing list.

       Shyamalan Fucking Rules!!   I can't wait for M. Night Shyamalan's sixth movie 'The Village'. I viewed the trailer and it looks good. Fuck it, even if it sucks, Shyamalan still excels at being a modern-day Hitchcock.  By the way, lesser mortals, I did not miscount. Night has made six movies but only three are well-known and one upcoming. Here's the breakdown for you tits:  Praying With Anger (1992) Wide Awake (1998) Sixth Sense, The (1999) Unbreakable (2000) Signs (2002) Village, The (2004)  Speaking of his works, I like Signs better than The Sixth Sense. But Haley Joel Osment, the kid with the gift/curse in Sense was fucking brilliant in my opinion... far better than Linda Blair in 'The Exorcist' and that already was fucking good.  "Run. The truce is ending." - Tagline for 'The Village'

       Scenes From A DVD   Dream Theater's "Through her eyes" is one nice song... and that is understating it. I had never really cared beans about Dream Theater before, although I know they are comprehensively talented. Why am I talking about a band, you asked? Well, I recently bought a whole lot of DVDs, and 'Dream Theater's METROPOLIS 2000: Scenes From New York' is one of them. The others are: Narc, Predator, Mystic River, The Last Samurai, Independence Day (don't scoff you fuckers...) Attila the Hun, The Bourne Identity, The Negotiator (hey.. Jackson and Spacey, what can I say?), Two Bits, Taxi 3, American Splendor, Once Upon A Time in Mexico (this sucks rectal bacteria... Thank God for Depp), The English Patient, 25th Hour (this is one of Spike Lee's BEST!), Johnny English (craP with a capital P)..  I think I missed out one or two dvds.  I'm fucking off for now.. be back later.  "Are you a Mexi  can   or a Mexi  can't  ?" - Johnny Depp to Danny Trejo in 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003)'

       Four New DVDs   After 14 days of reservist duties and five days of vacation, I'm back.. worse than before. I bought four dvds from Amazon.com - Once Upon A Time In America, starring Robert De Niro and James Woods; Deceiver, a whodunnit starring Tim Roth and Chris Penn; The Boondock Saints, a funny and entertaining vigilante movie starring Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus; and Sex, Lies and Videotape, Steven Soderbergh's (Traffic, Ocean's Eleven) first feature film starring James Spader who is absolutely fantastic in this.  Once Upon A Time In America is a motherfucking long movie. At 3hrs 49min, it made me feel as if I spent 3 years of my life watching it. It is good and sad but definitely nowhere as good as The Godfather Trilogy or Goodfellas. Its cinematography, breathtakingly perfect is better than Godfather. I really feel as if I've gone back in time. The props and settings are so fucking authentic.   To summarise, Robert De Niro and James Woods, beautiful cinematography, nice story, excellent score and a few rape scenes thrown in makes this a good buy.  James Woods walks into a room in a bank which he and Robert De Niro are robbing and sees De Niro raping a bankteller and says: "We're going... you coming?" Get it? "Cumming?" Heh heh.. bastards.
