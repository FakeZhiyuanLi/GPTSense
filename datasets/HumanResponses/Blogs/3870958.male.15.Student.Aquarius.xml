       As I mentioned on my previous posting I was looking on the Java Sun website as a novice programmer, and i thought it might to useful to tell anyone reading my blog that I found the website quite helpful. First i downloaded the Java Software development kit (SDK) from here:  urlLink http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download-netbeans.html  which comes bundled with a few other things and installed the kit. to actually find out what to do i'm, at the mo, using this URL, which is very clear, very well-written and i'm sure will help anyone wanting to learn how to program: urlLink http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/ . Also can i just say that no previous experience is needed but relatively average IT competence would come in useful. u'll get accustomed to the terminology and everything pretty soon if ur enthusiastic enough and ready to read

       Well, after 3 years of trying to come up with ideas for websites, programs, ambitions to do something important and so on and so forth, I accidentally discovered blogger. I'd read political and personal blogs before but it always seemed like a bit a chore having to write so much and then having people scroll through long lists of YOUR diaries. I always thought people on both sides were a bit sad but now I understnd that people like to express opinions and share experiences because that's what I feel i should be doing; and so i decided to publish a blog on the web in a matter of 30 seconds while I was randomly looking on the web for something interesting. The story goes like this   (IF YOU DONT WANT TO READ A LONG BORING STORY GO FURTHER DOWN THE PARAGRAPH WHERE THE STORY ENDS AND READ ON)   : Being educated under English curriculum I had to go on a week of "Work Experience" which basically means I work in a sophisticated workplace for a week without pay and in the end i get a report on my performance and different skills; anyhow, I chose to go to Manchester Computing, a department of the University of Manchester. There isn't much to do at this time of year in the university, what with the students having finished their summer term and things, so the most productive thing I thought i should do is browse the web find out what sort of things i could make of my life and one of my colleagues suggested i start off with Java, so i was on the java sun website ( urlLink java.sun.com ) and I came across the abbreviation API and i didn't know what it meant and so to make a long story shorter (well, you know ... )as i was browsing google and searching i came across BLOGGER on the google website and thought, "Well, hey, there's an idea..." and i'd set up a blog.  (IT'S OVER YOU CAN START READING AGAIN)   anyway, with this blog i think i'll be far more successful than I was with the numerous websites that i've set up and given up on either because i didnt know what more to do with it or because i couldnt be bothered. I called it RANDOMIZED DIARIES because i've been developing the idea of a website or something similar in which i could publish anything that interests me, or might interest others; anything. I guess some of these will be...Computer/Video games, persian history, my own diaries, personal philosphies, experiences, advice and so on, graphics/website design, music etc. and i'd also be glad to see a small community of like-minded people being brought together, especially iranians and people of around my own age (16) or otherwise. I'll be posting. btw, API stands for APLLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE, more on  urlLink google definitions
