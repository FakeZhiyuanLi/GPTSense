      Love at first site? Do you believe in love at first site? I do. But today my boyfriend brought up a side about it that I never thought of it before. He said how can their be love at first site when people say they don't love someone because of their looks? But love at first site is like loving someone that you don't even know. You see their outside and their looks but you don't know their personality and who they are. But then soon you learn to know them and understand them. That is what make love so special. Knowing so much about someone and loving them for who they are. Love is a really good thing to have but sometimes it can hurt so badly that you don't understand why people fall in love when it only hurts?

      I never thought I would use this place for my daily blogging, but since  xanga.com  has been down i decided to finally use this. I am slowly learning how to work this so give it some time. Wow the last entry was from  Feb. 23rd  so much has happen since then. But you don't need to know about that. Anywho well, one thing is my birthday is coming up =) how great is that to think I am finally turning 15 ahha wow I am the youngest out of the three cousins, but its all good you know even though they get to do things before me, but I don't really care. I am doing much better from my last xanga entry I've been quite bummed out, but I am slowly recovering from it. At times it stills hurts, but the verge of emotional break-down is slowly fading and on the edge of exploding into tears sometimes come around but not as often. I'm just sad that  my best friend won't  be here for my birthday =(. I am glad to have everyone else here with me though, but it would be nice if he was going to be here too, but he won't sigH. Well, its good for him because he wants to get away from this place just like I do, but I don't have the chance to get a way unlike him, he does. I hope he has a fun trip and a safe one. Hopefully he doesn't hurt himself like he always does gezz. Anywho when I know of what else to write about I will.  Since the last time I post about  L O V E  maybe this time I will talk some more about love. Honestly, I don't know what love is. I doubt that anyone does. Its an emotion, a feeling that you can't describe, but you just feel it when you are with a certain person. They are constantly running through your mind and they are the only person you think about 24/7. You won't realize you love this person until you have been through a lot with them then it finally hits you that they are the one person you love. At times knowing you love someone isn't good because it can be at a wrong time. "Why do we fall in love when love would only tear us a part?" - quoted from Vi3 [ Eyes Closed So Tight ]. That is a question that keeps lingering in my mind. I believe that people fall in love even though eventually they will get hurt is because during that period of time that you are being love and loving that someone special you get a feeling that you can never get unless its by love. You risk it all just have that feeling with you even though you know you will be hurt. At times you will have to make sacrafices just to be happy. "Don't  CRY  because its over  SMILE  because it happened." sigH "What is love?"  Track #1 _  Brandy  -  Have You Ever  CHORUS:   Have you ever loved somebody so much  It makes you cry  Have you ever needed something so bad  You can't sleep at night  Have you ever tried to find the words  But they don't come out right  Have you ever, have you ever   Have you ever  Have you ever been in love  Been in love so bad  You'd do anything  To make them understand  Have you ever had someone  Steal your heart away  You'd give anything, oh  To make them feel the same  Have you ever search for words  To get you in their heart  But you don't know what to say  And you don't know where to start  REPEAT CHORUS  Ooh  Have you ever find someone  You dreamt of all your life  You'd do just about anything  To look into their eyes  Have you finally found the one  You've given your heart to  Only to find that one  Won't give their heart to you  Have you ever closed your eyes  And dreamt that they were there  And all you can do is wait  For the day when they will care  Have you ever loved somebody  REPEAT CHORUS  What do I gotta do to get you in my arms, baby  What do I gotta say to get to your heart  To make you understand  How I need you next to me  Gotta get you in my world  Cuz baby I can't sleep  REPEAT CHORUS TWICE  Oh, Have you ever

      Well,  xanga.com  was up for a little bit and now its back down how gay! gezus!  Oh god here I go. I am deeply sad by the way you are right now and what had happen to you. I just wish you don't do anything stupid or anything to hurt yourself. I am deeply sorry for what happen, but I believe its better because you don't need her you can do better, but I know you did like her too. Sigh I don't know what to say. Besides I am sorry for the fact that I was being so stupid and kept asking you all these questions when it just happened. I wasn't being a supportive best-friend and I am sorry. I shouldn't have like pressure you with all these questions, but I just want you to know that I am worried about you. Right now I am so scared you might do something stupid and hurt yourself :X I seriously hope you don't. I am always here for you even if you want me to be or not, even if you like it or not, but I choose to stick with you through thick and thin and that is what I am doing + I promise I will always be your best-friend and I never made a promise that I won't keep esp. this one. I am keeping my promise no matter how hard it gets. I couldn't let go even if I wanted to. Life goes on and + like you said " sh!t happens "... take good care and have fun in Michigan.
