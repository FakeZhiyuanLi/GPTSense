       Café du Nord  The show was super busy and sold out in ten minutes. Those guys really know how to pack them in. And thankfully it was well laced with lovely ladies; makes work easy. With the exception of the underaged girl I found drunk, the evening went like clock work (orange). 1 (one) bottle calistoga - Flat. 3 (three) cigarettes - One donated by a very lovely lady. So lovely, in fact, that I felt compelled to buy her a drink. And here I thought I'd given up buying drinks for ladies. Oh well, rules are meant, blah, blah, blah. 2 (two) glasses Fuller's 2 (two) shots Jamie (Jameson) 2 (two) shots Fernet   Cybelle's  2 (two) slices cheese pizza - $4 2 (two) slices cheese pizza - $0 4 (four) slices mushroom pizza - $0 Tip for the drunk and hungry on a budget; show up ten minutes before closing and reap the rewards. Also, be nice.   home  1 (one) bottle Vitamin Water - Balance

       Home  Thanks to commercials I know longer like the following songs: Rubberband Man Kung Fu Fighting And that damned Comcast tune that steals the chords from Filter's,  urlLink Take a Picture . 2 (two) bottles Vitamin Water - Essential and Multi-V.  Listening to: Martin L. Gore's take on the Velvet Underground's, Candy says.  urlLink Beth Gibbons  also did a version on her tour with Rustin Man.  Televised background noise: ER History channel is doing  urlLink booby traps . Natsukashii. D+D style. But  urlLink landmines  suck.  Damn you, Alton Brown; for explaining exactly why pot roast takes so long. But it smells good  now .  I really should get to that laundry...

       Tiki bar  I can't remember the name of the place but it was next to the Lumiere. 2 (two) shots Fernet - $15 w/tip   Lumiere Theater  1 (one) film $0 - Sneak preview of  urlLink Primer . I didn't stick around for the afterparty.   laszlo   urlLink Planet-Mag  party, it was weak, so me and Core broke out.   Dalva  Met up with Feak and we each had: 3 (three) shots Jameson - $15 w/tip Mad love to Jude, Pete, Ronny, Byron (who snuck in on the late), Jim (who was pouring), and  urlLink Toph  (who was spinning). Much better. It was starting to heat up but I sometimes have Bar ADD, so...   Café du Nord  1 (one) shot Jameson - $0   Gold Cane  Dead, and the people who we came to see- gone.   Hobson's Choice  Dude fest. But I did get a chance to say hello to a lovely bartender I hadn't seen in months.   Milk  Bingo. This place was hoppin'. 3 (three) cover charges - $0 2 (two) shots Jameson - $0 Tons of beats and a gang of honeys- Priceless. Knowing how to talk your way into clubs and impress your friends is grand... for everything else there's Hans. And Hans is old school Fadeopia.   Post street  I turned the corner onto post from some alley I shouldn't have been walking up given the state I was in, and I see... 1 (one) guy on the ground - Mid 40s, asian. Moaning like all hell. And... 1 (one) guy on a motorcycle - Late 40s, white. Talking to both a 911 operator and his friend at the same time.  The guy was reassuring his friend and saying that he'd be okay. But it sounded like he was going to leave him before the cops got there so I decided to stay just to be sure the guy didn't bolt. And bolt he might have, because he was drunk and BECAUSE HE'D JUST RAN OVER HIS FRIEND. *Note to self- no drunken wheelies into your friends.  Anyway, I stuck around for awhile. I have a secret love of  urlLink crash investigation , and the  urlLink cop  was hot. Let's hear it for women's lib.

And  no , I didn't get any laundry done.

Damnit though, I can't find my zippo. Time to quit?   Shift off  2 (two) vodka tonics - Unfortunately I spilt one. And spilt it very publicly. Trés mal. 1 (one) 12oz. glass Champagne - Good lord, I had forgotten how badly champagne can fade you. Especially when one is pressed for time and gulps it all down like a Hamm's 1 (one) cigarette    urlLink Elbo Room   For old time's sake. And for the sake of sore eyes. 1 (one)  urlLink Ketel One  martini $0 - I had been dying for one all night. 1 (one) Fernet $0 - The shot of champions. I must say that this was an awesome reggae night. *note to self; go back. Went with Fadeopian original Core. The man is class personified. A prince amongst men. And smoother than silk. For real.  Ummm... rumps. Oh, and big ups to Tré at the bar.   Ma maison  Attempted to perform my usual drunken cooking technique. Bad idea. Burnt up yet another pot and again pissed off my roommate. I'm going to need to find a solution to the drunken munchies. I'm not really to die in a smoke induced fit of suffocation. But I did have fun last night.

      You may have noticed; I spend a lot of time in bars. I work in one, a venue. The first IC experiment was conducted purely on free time. Then it was personal... this time it's business.   Café du Nord  2 (two) bottles water - Crystal Geyser 2 (two) pieces  urlLink Black Black  - Chewing gum. 3 (three) cigarettes - Including one shared with a lovely lady.   Earl the First:  Underaged kid, ejected for sneaking alcohol, was introduced to me as someone who would not be returning, promptly fell on his face. He spent the rest of the evening passed out in a pool of vomit face down in the parking lot. His friends left him there and went back in to see the show.  Moral: Either stop being an asshole or get better friends.    after hours  1 (one) Ketel tonic - A double.   Earl the Second  Cab ride home, went to close the cab door and was aquainted with a handful of someone's half digested dinner.  Moral: Never let your guard down, or at least carry hand wipes.

       Café du Nord  3 (three) cigarettes - Donated by a lovely lady. Thank you. 1 (one) cigarette - Also donated by a lovely lady complete with... 1 (one) conversation - About the state of modern music and the lack of music history in current society. 4 (four) shots  urlLink Jameson  - Sweet. 1 (one) half pint  urlLink Fuller's  - Just for variety. 1 (one) more cigarette - Donated by yet another lovely lady. See a pattern?   The after party  1 (one) bottle Newcastle - byob, yo. The police had been by the party before I got there. Bastards. It was breaking up, but still I got see about a dozen peeps from all over the city before I jetted. Damnation, I was looking forward to seeing the sun come up.   Back at the Ranch  3 (three) lamb tacos - Drunken cooking style. There were actually four but I dropped one on the floor. At least I wasn't drunk enough to eat it.  Total cost for the evening: $0 - I win!

      1 (one) 0.5 lb Salmon - tasty. 5 (five)  lamb tacos - Okay, but no cilantro. Neither myself nor my roommate have anything even remotely related to a green thumb. We watched our garden slowly die with a numb sort of fascination, though we did get a month's worth of parsley and basil out of the deal. 1 (one) Vitamin Water - Lemon-Lime, Stress-b, the new tap water.

      Can't believe I'm at it again. Well, I'm starting up the Immaculate Consumption project once more. I will list everything I consume everyday in the hopes that it will help me (and maybe dissuade you from such folly). Help me understand where it is that my money goes and help me be conscious of what I do to my body.  The previous versions of the IC project (started in 1997) were conducted at a time when I had considerably more disposable income and also considerably more debt. I think that this time will be an interesting take on the subject.  Ha.  -aegis (I'm back)
