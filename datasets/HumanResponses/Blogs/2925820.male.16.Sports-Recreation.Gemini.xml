      man...baseball season...WHOOPIE! this season has been fun...though we've lost all of them thus far...it's still fun...i mean it's not like it really matters, parents seem to like our playing...which is kinda sad...but hey, u dont wanna come out and watch us play, dont. our team is interesting...there's...Me, Matt Thrasher, Stephan Soules, Bryan Mueller, Deep..., Nate, Noel, Jesse Meyers, and Al Mal...(16 year olds)...then we got...Garett Bartz, Casey Quinn, Brian Dahl, and Danny Dressen (17 year olds)...which should make for a pretty good team...but as luck would have it...noone shows up to the games...and our coach doesnt either :P...one word will sum up our team and our performance...JANKY!...well, i think thats enough baseball for tonight...  i've kinda been thinking...change is good right?...well, if change is soo damn good...why is it never good enough for the people u changed for? :\...i understand the whole not caring about me and all that shit...that fine...but please, dont blow me off...for trying to be better than i was...im trying to make you happy, but it's like either you dont want to be happy...or i sure as hell am not the person who u want to make u happy...w/e...i've lived my entire life not caring about shit...and now that i do care...it's like i should just stop, soo please if i cant make u happy tell me so, tell me i only cause more pain to you, tell me that u were never happy (with me)...it just feels like everytime i talk to you, im pushing you away...everytime i think of you, you start to drift away...u r the one thing in my life i dont want to leave...you r the reason im still here...no not you, a blind hope, a blind hope that maybe you could love me too...but i guess that's all it'll ever be...nothing but a blind hope...a dream...an unatainable goal...:(...........................

      well, idk what im gonna do...im just soo sick of people telling me to just give up with the whole loving people namely jessica, i mean...i know and completly understand that she does not love me or care about me like i do...i get that...and just because she doesnt feel the same way doesnt mean im not going to love her and care about her...soo if u arent jessica and u really think your opinion matters to me...i laugh...cuz honestly we are all entitled to our opinions and we r also entitled not to care about them!...i know i've hurt allot of people...sum allot more than others...but i am seriously trying to change, i want to be loved and cared about just like anyone else...i want to be there for the people i love, but it sucks cuz they dont feel the same way, and it's like they dont want me there...which im cool with...im just soo ashamed of myself...instead of being "in-touch" with my emotions...all i've known to do is pick on people (which im over), drink (i am getting over), and smoke (dont wanna get over)...i've never been able to freely express myself like i do now...and the only reason i can do it is because of people like becca and jessica...soo im not going to stop caring about them and im not going to stop loving jess...im sorry if this makes anyone sad, i just needed to get that off of my chest...peace  p.s. GAME TIME!...and i got one on sunday 8:30, Dakota Park...hope to see ya'll there

      hmmmmm, things r kinda lookin up...it's probably just all the Prince flowing through my blood right now...omg...just listening to Prince can make you feel like true love really can exist...and that anyone can love anyone (great feeling)...it amazes me as to how little we know about love...but how much we think we know...CREAM, GET ON TOP!...:P...love that tune...i've been talking to some old friends receantly...since it feels like all the people i get close to in SLP are fading away...i decided to talk to one of my best friends in Hopkins...it was cool...i kinda got up with the times in Hopkins...it was pretty cool...as of right now life is...:\...which really isnt a change...considering i dont hang out with anyone anymore...*shrugs shoulders*...o well, i've actually been thinking bout moving to South Minneapolis...at least for the rest of the summer...it'll be better there...noone to talk shit...or put eachother down...no reason to be sad...for me or anyone else...no more tears shed over stupid shit i say...no more smoking issues...and best of all no more past...just a future...and if i like it enough...i might stay...it's not like it matters...well, im out...Sleep!!!!!!!!..........peace

      i guess it's a good thing i've lost everyone...soo now i can freely write in this thing again...i just dont get it...who knows...i might get a 2nd chance to make everything right...man, wouldnt it be great if poeple were more trusting...but if they were...then i would too, i've trusted a grand total of 3 people this year...and im no longer in contact with any of them...it's probably just my nature (pushing away the people who matter most)...i really dont see a reason to continue...what reason do i need?...people of this world dont give a shit about how i feel...if im happy, they do everything they can to bring me down...and hell, if im down, they do everything they can to smash me lower into the ground...i fucking dispise this world...and i cant stand the people who think they can just trample over anyone or anything they want...it makes me want to cry...our world is soo sick and disgusting...we live in a society where it's normal to be obese and to over-eat...even when we know there are people across the ocean who are dying of malnutrition and starvation...i dont see why our "country" or our "president" need all these armed forces...all we have to do is collectively lay down our weapons and embrace eachother...we've lost too many lives fighting for "freedom"...a "freedom" that we (teenagers) will never see, because we dont "understand"...i dont want our dirty corrupt "freedom"...i just want a 2nd chance at life...like a re-do...then i could make it right...Peace

      hmmm, life has gotten interesting...i mean it's totally cool if people dont want to hang out, or make time to chill, honestly right now...that is the least of my worries...me, ian and becca saw Catwoman...DAMN...Hallie Berry is one SEXAY WOMAN!...ok, soo we were sitting in the theatre and we saw a preview for a Tom Clancey game...and right then and there, me and Ian decided we were gonna make up a game that requires 100% stealth, and we r gonna play in the MoA...SOO AWESOME (i'll talk more about it when it really gets goin)...well, nothin new really, my phone got hit by a car, but i promptly got a new one...havent seen jess in ova a month now...uhhhh...i almost live over at Ian's (and vica versa)...i've smoked allot more refer receatnly than i did like all last summer (due to lack of people to chill with...ehmmm...)...baseballs over...idk, i guess lifes changing...and i think this time im ready for it :\...im not saying being caught off guard is a good thing by any strech...but im kinda tired of not expecting anything from anyone, and not getting upset over nothing (im sure it's better this way, but it feels like im starting to lose my touch :\)...o ya, and i've been thinking again...and if u know me, u know thats the sign to stop taking what i say literally :P...but seriousely...if my thinking hurts u, tell me...ok heres what i've been thinking about...  i totally stopped caring about anything for like a week...then something like friday night kicks me in the face...when the one person u really care about wants to die, i guess it's kinda a wake up call...it's not all about me, it never was before, and i dont want it to be...it just feels like sumtimes i cause more pain then help...and i think thats y u arent making an effort to see me *shrugs* you're the only person who knows why...and i seriously meant what i said...i have absolutly no problem seeing you with other people, cuz u never wanted to be with me, and it is highly doubtful that you would ever want to be with me...i would love it (but i know it isnt mutual)...and besides, u r with the man u wnat to be with right now...or else he wouldnt be your bf...and honestly you happiness is&nbsp;all that matters to me...i would rather see you happy with another man for a minute, than unhappy with me for a second (even though i know i've caused more pain than happiness)...well, that's all im gonna say, i think i should stop...before i get all worked up... :\...hmmm i think u already know what i was gonan say here, but i might as well, I love you (and there aint nothin u can do about it :P)................peace

      i've been sitting here for awhile...hoping, wishing...i could just be there...with you, being with u makes me soo happy...makes me remember that my life has not been wasted...it reminds me that something, no, someone exists who is as, no more beautiful than the sunrise, or sunset...and at the same time as mysterious as the red planet...sumone whom i find myself falling in love with, more and more with each passing moment...sumone whom cared about me once...then i fucked up, twice...and now it feels as though, it will never be the same...u will never love me...and i accept that, but i refuse to stand by and watch u become sadder with each day, for i have seen your radient smile...heard your melodious laugh...and it pains me soo, to know...i may never see it again...whatever u make of this, i just want you to know...i love you with all of my heart...peace

      well, my life has basically gotten flipped, turned upside down...i dont even know if jessica knows i exist anymore...idk, i chewed her out alittle...which she didnt need, or deserve...cuz she has been such a good friend to me...this is probably one of the worst things that has happened to me since well, the last fight me and jess had :\...i miss her, dont get me wrong...but like right after me and jess fought, i met leslie...omg!...this girl is soo sweet and cute...shes smart, funny, cute, fun, and idk, she kinda brightens up my days...she means alot to me...i cant wait til i get a chance to go down south to see her, i havent met her yet, but i still see sumthin there... :\ ...im gonna kidnap her and we r gonna cuddle the whole time im there... :) ...o ya, and i figured out what was missing in my life...it wasnt that i was too alone...cuz im used to it, it was the lack of hugs, and cuddling in my life...i had a discussion, and we agreed that once u can find sumone who u can just lay with n your arms, while u r watching a movie, or w/e and u feel secure enough to fall asleep in their arms...u found sumthin real...god...it just sucks...cuz my mind is like split in half!...jess and leslie...idk, i want to stay close to jessica, but i dont think she wants anything to do with me :( ...o well, life will go on and i dont think there ever was anything there... :\ ... i still and will always love her, but i dont think its worth trying to give my heart to sumone who doesnt want it...
