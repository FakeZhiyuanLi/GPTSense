      Its another Monday, another dinner and another nite of TV session. However this time round theres so much more warm in the apartment.I see a family growing here. More joy, laughter and occasional bark from my little Bubs.Its so different now with a dog running around and 4 people eating in front of the TV. It used to be just lem and i, simple day, simple food, simple TV session, simple Jay singing and getting ourselves into stupid arguements (mainly due to the fact that someone was suffering from a MILD ADD).Im glad i have Lid and mabel now, i no longer  have to deal with this ADD case alone. I also have to thank my neighbour rachel for doing alot of research on ADD to encourage us how to deal with such people. Well...one thing i learn from Parkville, no matter how irritating, dirty, weird, funny, fat, short, tall, chingchong or kuchingchong your frends r, each and everyone plays a very significant part and means alot to me here in Melbourne. Lastly, to my dearie lid, welcome to the family and glad that you have come to share your life with us.

      No doggie will be as cute as you. U are my one and faithful one. U turn me up when im blue. U warm me up when im cold. U got the most unbelievable innocent eyes i've ever seen. U destroy things in a harmless way. Your gentle bark got me almost melting away. Every lick of yours speaks love. Feels like im standing in a timeless dream of light mists of pale amber rose when u are always next to me. I want to tell u and the whole world... I luf u and please spend the rest of your life quietly by my side.  Your mummy, adeline

      Like one of your songs God,  just let me say how much I love You. With all my heart I long for You. For I am caught in this passion of knowing.This endless love I've found in You.Let me find You in the desert.Till this sand is holy ground.And I am found completely surrendered. To You my Lord and Friend .  God, let not my heart condemn me all the time. YOU are greater than my heart and YOU know everything and every thought. Let me not have any ideas of my own, no actions of my own. I want to forget my wound and each tear that had fallen. May you do it all through me. God, thank you for loving me for i have done nothing to deserve your love. And in the words of St. Augustine, "By loving the unloveable, You made me lovable."

      As im sitting in my room now, im trying to count my blessings and spend some quiet time thinking about God for inspiration to write my blog. At times, the unanswered prayers in my life may have shaken me to pieces by unbelief, and filled me with tormenting doubts. Faith, hope, and love seem to be quite extinguished.I realised i may not be the only one and that kind of a comforted me. My favoutite author, Philip Yancey mentioned in one his books, he learn to trust God with his doubts and struggles by getting to know Jesus. Im sure God wants me to know im not the only one. And in every trial, it produces patient and perseverance. I know something good is going to come soon. In Him I hope, in Him I trust.  I saw an answered prayer last Saturday. And its been a long long time since i last saw an answered prayer that was so clear to me. Praise the Lord! God brought Rachel to church and she is beginning to open herself up. God please show Choo you are REAL and you are already LOVING her. You give it all for her and you are the LOVE that rescue her. Rachel, thanks for coming and i want you to know the GREATEST joy in my life is that i have found Jesus and i would like to share this joy with you. Theres so much i can say but you have to go and taste Heaven to know that it is good = )

      Mabel said my blog is always so "feel" and im always such a sad person. Thats the reason why i kind of stop writing for awhile to do some reflections Im not sad and i don't think im a melancholic person all the time. Just that life with God doesntalways work like we thought. High expectations slam against the reality of personal weaknesses and unwelcome surprises. At times God just seem so remote and emotionally unavailable. Guess it just so happen is down on the graph at this stage of my life. But like the saying goes, sometimes you have to go all the way down in order to come up again. I think im getting up and im beginning to see my face on the surface of the water. I realise throughout my life, i always focus on the people around me. Its always people, people, people.Tests always show that im people oriented than task oriented. Some said, its good because that shows, im sensitive to people around me. But recently, i kind of realise maybe im too SENSITIVE. Lid said something to me the other day, which kind of a kept me thinking for a few days (girlfriend you also quite deep sia). Its not the people around you that adapt to you, you adapt to the people around you. Im so glad i have found another girlfriend here. Someone, who make you see things in a different light and yet understand how you feel as a girl. Lid, you are so so right about we really cannot do without our girlfriends.   I really enjoy the girls company here in Parkville.We can bitch about men, talk about bodyshapes, shoes, bags, bras and watched DVDs. I so love all these things. You girls brought so much joy into my life here in Parkville. Its definitely another chapter and something i look forward to pen down in my own personal diary .And to you girls, i have to use my famous line, LUF U GUYS TO THE MOON N BACK!!!!!!!!!!! Yue Liang Dai Bian Wo De Xin = ) I so so look forward to our gyming session. The 2 of u never fail to make me laugh and its been a LONG time since i laughed so much. Its going to be another place that we can do our bitching while running on the trackmill. But lid, you got to watch that 170 heart rate while you are bitching. Its amazing how you can still talked so much  with your heart pumping so FAST. You are really a BITCH QUEEN. And my dearest Choo,I dont think they need another cleaner in the gym. Stop cleaning up every damn thing inside!!!!

      Its my last paper tomorrow. Everyone is asking me are u excited? Where are u going? Somehow, i don't feel anything. Maybe i am numb to the ending of exams. I no longer feel happy, cheerful and looking forward to how im going to spend my holidays. Perhaps, im getting sensible. I realise life is not all about playing and enjoying. I see how hard my parents slog to pay for my education here and they never get to enjoy as much as i do. I thank God for such wonderful parents. They gave me almost everything and at times, me wanting more makes me feel horrible. Why am i  constantly not contented with things around me? Why? I really don't know? I also dislike myself setting high expectations with those around me. If God acccepted me for who i am, i see no reason why i cannot accept the flaws in friends. Its always after much reflections, i realise i have done things i should not have and my actions may hurt people in some ways. If only that moment can be taken back, i would definitely do so. I wish im much calmer and that childishness in me can fade away quickly. I do not like this self-centredness in me. Im always looking at myself, its disgusting to see that i have grown to be such a selfish person at times. Where is the LOVE God taught me? And the love i have promised God that i would display? Is Satan really working very hard?   Seeing a friend upset, can be pretty disturbing. I wonder how you are doing on the other side but do know that i care and love everyone of you. Friendship isn't always easily described. The Eskimos, they say, have a hundred different words for snow. Unfortunately, the English language isn't quite as innovative, though it has vast opportunities to differentiate meaning. Certainly, Love is one of those opportunities. And so, too, is Friendship.  Instead of different words, however, we are stuck with simple adjectives. Close friend. Best friend. Childhood friend. Intimate friend. Trusted friend. Beloved friend. But whether you use adjectives or different words, few could deny the nearly infinite meaning in such a simple word.  Friends are special people. We cant pick our family, and we are sorely limited in the number of them at any rate. Society and mores (and often our own conscience) dictate we select a single mate. But our friends can be as diverse and infinite as the adjectives we choose. Our friends, in a very real sense, reflect the choices we make in life.

      Sometimes i wish God make me a carefree bird. I can just fly to anywhere. I sense my heavy feet all the time. I wonder why sadness is battling in my heart and i also wonder why i choose not to talk to those surround about things anymore. So this moment, i just have to scream out loud inside. I suppose i just have to keep moving on and paint some new colours for myself.  Rachel, thank you for everything. Your strength always keep me going. Your smile and laughter cheers me up. Your presence assure me that i am always not alone here in Melbourne. Your friendship shows me you are a true person. Your love for me is ever so sincere. You stood by me when situation disappoints me. You always understand me without even asking. Whats important, you never ever let me down as a friend. I LOVE you and i want you to know God love you too.

      Theres this saying, one touch is worth ten thousand words. I was touched last nite just by a simple action and this touch kind of a melted a dam of ice in me. God sent people in my life every now and then. Some will leave a deep impression and some bad vibes. And some will always be very special and have a huge place in my heart no matter what. This very special frend made me see love and beauty all around again. He is big hearted, he accepted my faults and im sure i have hurt and disappoint him in certain ways but he choose to welcome me back with open arms. Though we no longer share alot together and things around us may have change but he showed me his love for me has not. I thank God that we have Jesus in us, that is why we choose to forgive, love and bear no grudge. I think im getting emotional again...But this time round, is a different Addy. She no longer crys out loud (cos she is a mother of a dog), she is less emotional and drama. Instead over the months, God has made her a strong person and her eyes have not been wet for awhile except last nite when she was touched.

      Today is the first time i brought my little darling Bubs to the park. I don't know why as i was walking towards the park, i guess i was more excited and nervous than Bubbles. Im not sure how my baby is going to react to the rest of the dogs and having an extremely cute and sweet face she is probably gonna attract alot of male dogs. As i expected, this dog (not sure whats the breed) by the name of Oscar felt in love with Bubs. Its definitely love at first sight for him. He charged towards my baby as we were approaching the park and started playing with her. Oscar really adores Bubs, he followed her everywhere in the park. Everyone in the park started giving her attention and think she is super duper cute. Being her mummy, i was so proud of her. Bubbles has brought a bundle of joy into my life suddenly and i never regretted buying her. When i first got her i was very apprehensive because she is my first dog, first pet and frends didn't have confident in me. But i decided to go for it. Bubs indeed has been a challenge. She also kind of a change my life as well. I so so look forward to come home,hug and kiss her. No matter how busy, moody, shitty or tired my day is, i want to give her 15 mins of my time. She brought the maternal instinct out of me,and i came to understand why all mothers will love their kids no matter how naughty, spoilt or rebellious they are and you will always want the best for them. The irony of it all is, in the mist of teaching her things i learn things from her as well. She taught me alot of patient (something i think im never good at) and she also taught me the big word RESPONSIBILITY. I thank God for her everyday and i also thank God im a much happier person now. This year has not been very good for me. I came back to Melbourne with this emptiness and wallow alot in self pity about things. I kept searching for answers for many things in life. My christian's path is often very rough, thorns and briars grow on either side,  theres like a dark cloud hang over it, and no cheering prospects appear to animate my heart. Sometimes i asked myself are trials really a mercies in diguise? But no matter what, i finally realise i have to learn to trusts in an immutable God. Theres this very special Sunday, that i felt God kind of spoke to me. Don't ask when, why, where for your answer prayer just live by simple faith. As simple as these words may sound to some people but i kind of a understood what God wants to tell me.  We walk by faith."  2 Cor 5 : 7

      Its been a really long time since i last wrote my blog. Maybe i haven been spending alot of time on my own. Being on&nbsp;my own means thinking. Thinking means facing reality.&nbsp; Things u thought u have already run away from but u realise u have never step out of it. I am like an oarsman rowing against a current. My will-pressure must be gentle but constant, to listen to God. I have to take hold and keep hold of God. However, at times this race seems so tough and exhausting.&nbsp; God seems so far and unreachable. He being invisible makes me lose hope.&nbsp; Losing hope means i am left with nothing and i am scare. Is my faith not strong enough? God am i being silly to find my miracle? Why things change so fast? Why things that once seem so beautiful in my eyes can just turn into something so different? Why the night never set me free? God, i still haven found what i am looking for.

      Met up with some cell group friends today. They are such nice people and made me feel really comfortable. I went over to their apartment, just above Brunetti, and we actually ended up chatting for quite awhile. I thank God for them and also thank him i finally decided to join a cell group. God is always so wonderful, he never fail to send people into my life to open up a new chapter. I look forward to be part of this cell group and feel God's pleasure.  Bubbles attended her first dog training session this evening. Don't think she likes it even though she was pretty well behaved as compared to the rest of the dogs. She looked distracted most of the time. I sense her trouble heart recently and wonder whats wrong with her.Our dogs know us, and love us, yet they know us only vividly, not clearly. We evidently strain their minds after awhile so this makes them want to get away. Dogs thus require their fellow dogs, the shallow and clear but they also require us the deep and dim. Bubs cheer up, you don't look happy.

      The author of Sacred Romance, John Elderedge mentioned about this particular character Lieutanant Dan in the movie Forrest Gump. Lieutanant Dan is a rough but capable man, whose family has produced a long line of military heroes killed in combat. He is confident that dying with honor on the field of battle is his redemption.When he is rescued by Forrest from a firefight, his wounds require both legs to be ampulated above the knee. He and Forrest, also wounded, are consigned to the same hospital ward where one night the rageful Lieutenant Dan drags Forrest from his bed. He proceed to choke and curse him for destroying his life by saving him. Later on, he goes to New York City and enter into purgatorial story of his own making, killing all desire for redemption. He lives off his veteran's benefits in a haze of alcohol, drugs and sex with prostitutues. One New Year's Eve, Dan got Forrest back to his apartment with 2 prostitutues. The prosstitutes play game, each of them pretending great attraction to Dan and Forrest. When Forrest is uncomfortable with his "date's" advances, he clumsily resists. With the play she is acting out ruined, she spits out, "whats wrong with thie retard?". And here Dan finds out he has not been able totally kill his heart. He is filled with rage at this treatment of Forrest and orders both of the women to leave. With his heart again exposed, he is brought to the realisation that he still cares.  Although, both my legs are not ampulated and i have never been in a battlefield somehow when i was reading about Lieutanant Dan in Sacred Romance, i find myself able to relate to him at the point when he realised that he still cares. Many times i realise i want to put myself in situations where i will be cold, lock up my entire heart and be indifferent to things around me . However, i am just like Lieutanant Dan, i can never kill my heart. I always still care...

      Is Bubbles really lonely? I tried to observe her today, i realised although mabel and i give her alot of love and care, the 2 of us actually make no attempt to play with her. Little bubs is always jumping around, she follows me everywhere in the apartment and constantly having Bo Bo (her bestfrend) in her mouth. So i decided to play catching with her in the house today. I chase bubs round and round and round the house hehehe. I kind of a enjoyed it. Never realise Bubs can be such a great entertainment. Someone used to tell me, most people will get tired of their dog one day and it wouldn't mean so much to you anymore. However, i have yet to experience it and as for now it works the other way . My love for Bubs definitely grow deeper by the days. She is the last thing i look at before i sleep and the first thing i look for when i wake up. I kiss Bubs at least 10 times everyday and im always thinking about her when im not home. I thank God for teaching me to love Bubs everyday. Its so strange, even though Bubs is just a little doggie i own less than 6 months she means so much to me. That also goes to tell me when i lose Bubs one day, I know i will be extremely upset. I think i will cry for 1 month or even more. To lose something that once means so much is for sure going to be very painful. So for now, better not think so much. The problem with me is i think too too long term at times.  There are a few people i like to thank in my blog tonight. Gwen, thanks for being such a sweet angel. A friend though we have not known long, your words of encouragement certainly brought alot of smiles on my face. I thank God for this new friendship. Lid, thanks for all the lunches. Even though its only an hour each time i enjoyed your company. I thank God for bringing u back to Melbourne. You are such a "siao bao". Mabel, thanks for the Nasi Lemak. Its so yummy...Even though your ADHD is pretty serious but you know i love u deep deep because you are such a Mother Theresa. And lastly, to my ex housemate, lemuel, i miss u so much and all the "wan an" and hugZzz  . T hanks for calling that nite and contantly finding something negative to say about my blog and body parts. Even though you are so irritating, you can't park a Tarago plus a mild ADHD because im so use to having you being part of my life in Melbourne, its so difficult not to love you. I luf you to the moon and back!!!!!
