      Hello hello everyone how are we doing well that's nice alright.  Hmm my second post in this (I think that's a record for any of my blogs!) Alright anyways I was at my dad's this weekend and holy crap i had such a good time i learned alot about my dad that i didn't know before. He lives out of town in sioux falls. Anyways spent most of the weekend in a camper out in there backyard (hey you're thinking white trash i'm thinking nature) Anyways I got talking to my dad about how he used to tell us stories of when he was younger and he'd always say oh yes theres always stories that i'll tell you when you grow older... Well guess what it turns out i'm old enough. Whew I never knew my dad was so crazy i always knew he was a big biker guy back in the day (70's 80's and such) anyways yeah it turns out my dad was a very interesting fellow way back when.He had some very very interesting stories to tell me and such anyways.  Saturday I had my hair cut! I hate it i hate it i hate it i hate it! Now it's really short and guess what I HATE IT! now i have to wait another 6 months for it to get back to old curly length.^-^ and no i never got a perm. Hmm nothin really much more interesting happened this weekend. well i guess i might go work out a bit more because i was gotta get toned!

      Okay first of all i'm not going to go into detail on who i am that will be told to you if you talk to me on aim or if you just read this thing as i post through. Hopefully I'll stick to this one i never kept up on my other ones but ohwell. Maybe I'll be a blogging genious over this one (I really truly doubt it.) Anyways I might as well babble on about something else in a new paragraph:  Okay I rented a movie today (or my mom rented but it doesn't matter i watched to today) The movie was the butterfly effect and i must say i was expecting a movie that wasn't the greatest (seeing as in i check every movie i want to see on www.movies.com for whether or not i should spend money on them i am very let's say careful with my money)Anyways didn't get the best reviews but why does that matter at times this movie in my opinion kicked ass it was awesome it really got ya thinkin. Since this whole paragraph will be about movies i guess i'll tell you about the other 2 movies i've seen recently.  Dodgeball: Saw it in theaters today it was actually really funny (dodge dip dive duck dodge) I liked it even though i don't really like ben stiller rip torn (that is an odd name) played really good in it so did the kid from jeepers creepers. Ben stiller played a retarded jackass in my opinion and wasn't the best but good for the part! Now yesterday my mom had rented a movie a while back i forgot the name of it but anyways it's something about a guy coming back from the future and explaining all this to a lady and they fall in love and blah blah blah i payed some attention to it since marissa tomei was in it (she's not that bad looking ^-^) anyways the movie wasn't that bad they looked into it and had pretty good talking about stuff (cheesemans theory of somethin or other cheeseman heh) anyways i'd give it about a 7.5 out of 10. Spider-Man 2: Saw the movie last wednesday i just thought i would put in here it was pretty good i liked it more than the first doc ock was off the hizzle fo shizzle pardon my blackness.   More stuff to babble about: My bro Josh bought a game the other day called farcry i swear it is one of the best computer games i have played  ever  It's fun and challenging i also play some baseball mogul on the comp another fun game baseball manager so you not sports people wouldn't like it. Errr i go in tommorow to have one of my spacers to be re-put into my mouth (ouchies at first they're getting better) Anyways i get braces next tuesday (NOOOOOO) I go to my dad's in sioux falls tommorow too. Hopefully it won't be that bad supposed to be hot though this weekend.   That ends my random babble for the week i guess i have nothing better to do then say in an arnold schwarzenegger tone I'll be back.
