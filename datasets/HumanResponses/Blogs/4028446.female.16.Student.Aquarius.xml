       24 July 2004.. tired day.. I just came back from the airport.. went to fetch popo(she come back from malaysia)..    Mom and I left house at 9:25pm.. we took 130 to the community centre so that we can change 410 which goes to bishan MRT station(J8).. When we reach J8, we went to buy some sweet coz I cannot take to long ride(will headache)..after that, we took MRT(because 10pm so got alot of ppl, we have to stand). finally reach Tanah Merah, we alight and waited for the onli train which goes to Changi Airport.. the whole journey is about 1hour and 30 minutes! Lucky we reach there just in time.. the plane just landed. Mom and I went to find my uncle, auntie and Lin..(popo live with them)      I never see them for  about two months liao.. Lin and me chat about lots of things.. the national day prade, school jumble sale, school work, etc.. After about 20 minutes, we saw popo coming out.. but with one of the staff. We all was wondering why.. then she told us that she wasn't feeling well so the staff help her with her bags..&nbsp; After greeting her, she went home with my uncle(by cab).. Mom say we could take 858 to yishun then call dad to pick us up, so we went to the bus-stop.. While waiting for the bus, I ask mom to call dad just to make sure if&nbsp;he is able to make it.. As I 'predict', he's not free(he never even on his hp!) so we have to walk to the MRT station which is at the other end of the airport.. When we reached there, it's close.. and onli have one note there.. Last Train 11:18pm!!! ARGH!! GREAT! no bus and train now we have to walk all the way up to take the cab.. wAstE tiMe and eNeRgy!!~ haha.. but worth it.. mom treat me eat burger(who cares if it's supper)..     After 22 minutes of ride, finally reach home! but that ride sure is expensive.. $23!~ I could have use the money to buy myself a new cd..!!
