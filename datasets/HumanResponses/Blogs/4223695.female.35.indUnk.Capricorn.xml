       So, now it's been a couple of dayse since I wrote anything.  What was I doing instead?  HMMMM.  I tried to get an appointment with the eye doctor yesterday, but he wasn't in, so I'm going today.  But I had planned to go and get a student planner for this school year when I went, so I went ahead and ran out to get that.  Ended up getting 2 notebooks that weren't planners, because the planners they had were boring, so I worked on arranging one of those to be my planner.  I straightened most of the worst part of the floor here in the laundry room.  Today, I want to clear off this worktable.  My appointment is at 2pm, so I need to decide if I want to go get crickets for BrakePad before or after the eye dr.  Probably before, since I promised tacos for dinner tonight.  I also need to make a flier for tomorrow.  I can most likely revamp the one I made last week, since we didn't use it.  I still haven't worked in a work out this week.  This needs to change next week.  I at least need to take the dog out for a walk, since noone else is doing it now.  Maybe I'll even get around to working on my spanish next week, too.  I guess we'll see!   ~Kristea

       I got rid of the one I downloaded. I guess I'll have to add learning about HTML to my huge to do list. Enough to download and edit a skin to where I like it, or just flat out make my own. I wish Blog offered at least a few different fonts. Oh well!

        I like the colors, but I'm not sure I'm too happy with the way it looks. I'm not sure how to make it have my name and stuff, but not too bad for my first try at downloading one, I guess.       I did pretty good today. Drank all of my water. Been going to the bathroom every 10 minutes. Cleaned out from under my work table -- well, half of it anyway. It  was  the worst half, though! I didn't exercise, but was very active.       I made out alternate schooling schedules last night to account for getting the books late. That effort may prove unnecessary, though, because my husband's boss put him in for an "in company award" kind of thing, but it equates to about $500. Very cool! I don't want to assume that it will be used for school, but I sure do hope we do! Would really be a load off my mind.

        Boy, I'm sure not good at writing things from my boring life. I went to a funeral this weekend. The mother of a friend of ours. Afterwards my husband and I got into an argument. We got our wires crossed about what was going to happen, and he decided to get upset that this seems to happen all the time. It's all better,now, though.      So today, I had a couple of errands to run...Went to Petsmart to get some crickets for my 15 yr. old's toad, BrakePad; went to WalMart for bread, milk and ice; and I went to Borders book store and got a Klutz book on hand-made cards. I've wanted this book for a while, now, and made a couple of things from the book while my son finished his schoolwork.     I didn't get as much done today as yesterday. Yesterday I got all the laundry done, save for the towels. I also got about a 1/4 of my room cleaned. Actually did a pretty good job there. But today, in addition to the above errands and relaxation, I made 5 lbs of taco meat. I thought that would be for dinner tonight, but my husband is not going to be home for the dinner time this evening, so I'll hold off on the tacos until Thursday or Friday. That's quite alright, since I really don't feel like making tortillas anyway. Plus, he said we should get something later---probably means Taco Bell or Pizza Hut. Haven't had one of these kind of "date nights" in a few weeks, now.    I sent off the registrations for the girls' school on Friday, and then a few hours later I realized I had forgotten to have my younger daughter sign the application. I am such a blonde sometimes! The offices for the school are in Seminole Florida, so it may take a little longer anyway to get this processed because of the hurricane. Once they get everything ready for me to order, I may have to wait a little bit to order due to funds. We had set aside a chunk of our tax refund for school, but have recently had a rash of family coming, car problems, and my husband needing some church clothes (he's been out of white shirts for a while and his suit was getting quite threadbare!) My younger daughter took the placement tests, and is going to need about 20 make up books. oy! Usually there is 12 books per course, but in English and math, she'll need around 20 extra. More in English than math. So the cost for the books will be more than I had estimated this spring. Hopefully I'll be able to start them the day after Labor Day, like I'd planned. If not, though, I'll have to wait until the middle of September to order, and closer to the end to get them started. I went through the calendar to see what days off I could eliminate. But the difference would be 12 or 14 days. Right now I have them scheduled to take 12 days for each of the 12 books in each class ( adjusted of course for the make up books). So I realized that I could just shorten the number of days for each book to 11, and that would give me the 12 days without having them give up any of their vacation days. Also, they are scheduled to get done on the Wednesday before Memorial Day, so I can also drag it out to Friday of that week to make 14! Cool Beans!      So much for not knowing what to write. Guess I just needed to get started! Hopefully tomorrow I'll get a little more done than today. In addition to the cleaning, I want to start exercising, and studying my Spanish.       Hoping for more tomorrow,    ~Kristea

         Well, I finally got a blog. I have never kept a diary or a journal, and I'm surely not going to put something  here  everyday! I do plan to write a few things that make me happy, or sad, or ticked, or that are just plain ridiculous. Also, maybe a few goals I'd like to achieve, because this may make me a little bit more accountable than if I just report to myself--although I seriously doubt anyone but me will read these entries! If, however, you have stumbled across this page, I hope something I write will make you smile, or at very least will be something you can relate to.
