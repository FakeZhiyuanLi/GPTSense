      "You are fearless in a way that I shall never know."   "I fear our days of peace are over."   "We have always had, since the day we settled here, a gentle understanding with the creatures who live beyond our borders: we do not stray into their woods, they do not come into our village."   "We may question ourselves at moments such as these: did we make the right decision to settle here?"   "I have always pictured them in some ways as our protectors. They have allowed us to live here, nestled amongst them in this untouched place."   "By the markings we find this morning on our homes, I feel they were warning us."

      There is no constant price this time around because  i am the one broken again  and i have found that there is no rebirth no baptisum no screams to blame on the wind because i cant breathe  *when the  stars  have fallen from the sky, and then everything else inbetween and im standing alone with that gaze in my eyes and im afraid to blink because i might fall asleep i know im  unloved unloved unloved *  Standing in the middle of a road, choking on thewords you said&nbsp;getting   hit  &nbsp;is the anwser sure why not  another family secret swept under the bed  so here i am in my fathers hands im jagged broken and spineless may my body lay untouched someplace where it will be missed I cant breathe  * *  So there i layed on my bed whisteling wind thundery night september 30 2003 is when  my father took his life  the crack in the window the chip on the wall he is for once asleep asleep once and for all just one  shot  and people are  falling falling falling  and i dont know where they are falling from because I cant breathe...  R.I.P. Jeffrey Fredrick Smith, October 3rd 1954 - September 30 2003 You didnt have to do this, You didnt have to... But you got cornered because&nbsp;I was confessing things&nbsp;I shouldnt have told anyone, but i did, and i screwed things up I know..im sorry I will make it up to you i sware...&nbsp;

      RIP Nevin Jesse Lonergan May 31 1988 -&nbsp;March 2004 ,  yeah he was one of my X's...I didnt know he had passed away because&nbsp;I hadnt talked to him sence the day we broke up...a day i&nbsp;do regreat...   We  had  a great relationship, we were going togeather for&nbsp;a year, at that time it was my  longest  relationship with a guy, and I thought i had it all.&nbsp; But I gusss  i&nbsp; was wrong .&nbsp; It shows us that when we are young, we dont know what true  love  is.&nbsp; We shouldnt even let thoes deadly words roll off our tongues " I love you ."&nbsp; Because we dont mean it.&nbsp; We thought we did, but we dont.&nbsp; Dont make the same mistake that I have done many times and just give your heart away.&nbsp; I am happy to say my heart is safe now, It has a good home...

      Lovely stranger how do you do? so sad to see u sitting alone at a table for two.  Lovely stranger how do you get by? She asked your name you asked the time.  3am she cant sleep, thinking of you alone at that table for two.  wondering who your waiting for your sleeping beauty is at home sleeping.Bt she swolllowed the key and locked the door so sad she never got your kiss so forever more she will remain oblivious .  You lovely stranger you pick up and move to see your sleeping beauty laying on the bed in her room.  the stair rail is cold and the door is locked you forgot your sleeping beauty had good intentions forgot in a heart shaped box.  Now the lovely stranger has a name but a secret his identy it shall remain.   As for sleeping beauty she turned out okay maybe having a daughter of her own someday.  Showing her who a real man is, one that wont leave her for a friend of his.   Im okay now and I understand that life and us werent always as planned. We made choices and we cant go back. Because you lovely stranger baught a ticket for a train on a one way track. Now that Lovely stranger moved to astate south of here to put an end to this and start a new currear.  Because Iwon the battle, I wonthe faught, because by the time the Lovely stranger got here, I will have already forgot.  Because Ill be sleeping on my bed thinkining of all the other things guys have said.  Ive made my choices Ive cried the last, My choice is how I not taking you back.  So what if I hurt you?  You hurt me too.  Forget all the things Inever told you.  My hand on the phone and a smile on my face.  Talking to another guy who could easally take your place.  You said youd love me forever and you loved me form the start. Well guess what Lovely stranger?  Your tearing us apart.  No more letters no more phone calls no more emails for you, Ill scream at the top of my lungs my Goodbyes to you.       Your sleeping Beauty is moving on because she got her kiss, yeah the one your never going to get.
