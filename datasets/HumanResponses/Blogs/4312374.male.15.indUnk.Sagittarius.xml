      Not much happened today. It was my mom's first day at school. Shes goin back to college for medical stuff so she can get a better job. So I woke up with her to walk her to her bus stop and cry. LoL. Then I came back and slept till about....3:30 when she came home. After that we talked about her day and discussed possible changing my first and middle name from Justin Royce to Royce Dywer. I'am debating..... After I get a few opinions I might decide. She started doin her homework while I watched music videos all day. I got twenty bucks from my Gandma for a baseball game I'm goin to on Friday. But I'm gonna save it...Mwahahahaha Time to go plot my evil plans to break up.....umm.....no one..>_>....nothing!!......

      Gentlemen!....Behold!.....My first post! (ATHF reference)  Well, today I just got back from my crazy family picnic. From making fun of my aunt's thankles, to laughing at my great grandma in a moo moo. It's all gravy. At first when i got there it was pretty burning but around like 3 everyone else started coming. All my aunt's and family's friends were so surprised cause my hair is all curly afro-like and my voice is all deep since the last time they saw me. It was funny. Meeting cousins I've never saw before and seeing even more craziness. My one cousin threw a cob of corn across the picnic table, it bounced of the umbrellapoll, and nailed a cup of orange soda that spilled all over my great grandma. So she went in my gram's house to change and came out in a moo moo. Three seconds of silence then ten minutes of laughing. Mwahahahaha. But my great gandma is a machine so everyone stopped makin fun of her before she started killin.....even though shes only like 4 feet and some inches tall. Later my cousin's were fightin. One of em is six and the other is ten.  Play by Play:    Six year old gets knocked down by ten year old. Chases him with a stick for a good 5 minutes. Finally gets him. Ten year old gets mad and puts him in a head lock. Six year old biteshis neck. Ten year old slams him. Six year old starts cryin and kicks him in the shins. Ten year old lands a totally un-fair gut kick to the downed six year old.  Then the parents intervened. I was ready to jump in just for kicks and giggles. So after a couple minutes of tension and yelling, my other Aunt and co. come back from swimming. Guess what? They got a new dog! Almost year old boxer, they also already have a year old husky. I was ready for a dog fight. So everyone has chairs in a circle around the yard as the dogs start to meet eachother. Nothin happens so i get disappointed and leave. So that was boring. Except when the husky went to meet the boxer he took out my uncle with his chain line. After that I heard my cousins yelling behind a house. Went back there to find out they were playing king of the hill. Mind you, I'm almost 16....the closest aged cousin there was 11. Mwahhaha go me!! Needless to say I mercilessly destroyed my cousins at the top of this hill. My uncles gotmad and made us stop.......They were havin fun........  Anyway, that was my crazy day. I'll keep ya updated. I have nothin better to do since one of my best friends phone privileges were taken away......Now, time to go look for something that lets you guys comment on my this crap. I don't know why I want -proof- that no one read this......
