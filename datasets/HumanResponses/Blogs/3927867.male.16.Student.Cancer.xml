      My fellow Asian people, welcome to my asianest blog ever (it's my first in fact....) I have created this blog to share with you my life, my feelings, and my knowledge (yes I do have some) so that you can all see that being Asian is one of the greatest gifts in this miserable, pitiful, god damn world!! ya!  So there, my name is Teoman Pontais, I am presently 16 years old, and I'm am half French and half Turkish, which explains my Asian-ness!! (yes Turks are Asians god dammit!!) I love my life, and I think that the most important thing to do to like it's own life is to like itself first. I am extremely narcississississississistic (thanks rio!), and ego centric and have a great compassion for my hair! But that doesnt mean I neglect my friends and comrades!! I love them all and would do anything to make them...laugh their guts out muahahahaha!!!!! They say I have an inner talent for imitations, acting, and being crazy. The sad thing is that they don't admit my asian side!! dammit!!  I love rock, and especially punk, and any type of metal. My favorite bands are; The Offspring, Green Day, Sum 41, Good Charlotte, NOFX, Mest, Rancid, Bad Religion, Blink 182, Papa Roach, Linkin Park, Metallica, Deftones, The Mad Capsule Markets, X Japan, Hide, Funeral For a Friend, Dropkick Murphys, Lost Prophets, Nostromo, Phobos Incantation, Pleymo, Slipknot, Korn, Marylin Manson, Muse, Goldfinger, Rhapsody, Eminem (ya that too ya), Elvis Presley, Blur, Gorillaz, Blood, Dir en Grey... wooaaaaah u name it!!!  And of course as an Asian, I looove mangas and animes!!!!! My favorite are; Naruto, Love Hina, Love Story, Saishu Heiki Kanojo, Girls Saurus, GTO, Negima, Cobits, Vampire Hunter D, Card Captor Sakura, Azumanga Daioh, Trigun, Akira, Cowboy Bebop, G-On Riders, One Piece, Dr Slump oh dammit so many here too!!  Then come the video games! Sooooo; Metal Gear Solid series, Final Fantasy series, Devil May Cry, Castlevania, Silent Hill, Sim City 4, Naruto, Tales of Symphonia, Disgaea, Golden Sun, Sword of Mana, Metal Slug series, GTA series, Warcraft 3, Medal Of Honor series....woooaaaaahh man i'm lost!  Finally (u'll be soon out of this pain don't worry), my favorite movies! Well it's easy, cos my favorite movie of all time is Austin Powers! It's so immature, stupid, and british that I just love it! I love comedies, immature movies, sex oriented stuff...teen movies u know!!  Oh well this is it for the presentations folks! Now I'll be writing down some events of my life, and may I remind you that some texts will be in english, and others in french. The french ones are for the french-concerned people!! haha  Oh well then, c ya all at Okie Dogs!   Yours asianly,  Teoman Pontais         wow man this stuff is deep!

      hahahaaa these are old friends...well i mean, two of them left to live in their country. Ya, sooo they made a band called SMK, stands for Shu Mai Kids...ya kinda lame i know.. well then these guys were just kinda "posing" cos Chao (the taiwanese guy, with the Les Paul) doesnt know how to sing. Hajime (the jap) just started learning drums, and he's quite good, i'm sure that with some practice he'll manage to be as good as Travis Barker! (I wish...) Then Gap, the jap (he's thai but i call him "the jap" cos it rhymes with "gap") is a hell of a fan of neo and emo bands (Funeral for a friend, lost prophets, papa roach, linkin park, pod, story of the year, hoobastank, deftones...). Young Keun, (the korean, with the bass) is korean, and he has a bass....uh right. Ya so Young Keun, and Gap are both gone now, so next I am gonna play be the guitar-vocals guy. And I'll so be with Hajime and Chao. I'll have to find a new name for the band; i'm the only one who speaks english here!     Here they jump...    Here they dont jump..keke
