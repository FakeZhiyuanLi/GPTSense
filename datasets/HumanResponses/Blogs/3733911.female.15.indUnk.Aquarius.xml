      Wow, I haven't wrote in here for a few days. Oh well, nothing really going on. Today is exactly 2months since me n Dann started to go out! YAY! I hope we stay together for a pretty long time. I love him so much. Well yea there really isn't anything to say, besides, yea nothing. Today was so boring. My mom keep waking me up to see if I wanted to go to Shady Maple or not. Im like no, Im too tired, its too early. So then she is like well Richy is going, I dunno should I go or not. So eventually, I got dressed, brushed my hair and put my hat on, so u really couln't realize no make-up on, and me and Gary left. My mom and Richy had left already. So yea. That was quite interesting during breakfast. Well then we came home. I don't know what time it was, but all I know is that I got my blanket from my room and layed down on the couch and fell asleep. I was real tired. Then I guess my mom and brother fell asleep too. My mom was on the other side of the couch and Gary was on the floor with Skeeter, and I guess Buddy was on the chair. We all then woke up about 2:30 and I got on the computer, half asleep. YAY! Now Im bored once again. So yea.. It prolly will be another few days til I write once again in here.  *~*Steph*~*

      My teeth still hurt like hell. But Im getting used to the braces now. So yea, I was very bored today. I had to wake up early today, but hey I got to go see Spiderman 2, my dad got free tickets from his work. It was really good. I think I like the first one better tho. Most movies the first one is always better. But oh well. I didnt go to the movies yesterday with Ash, Court and Dann. Oh well my mom was like why dont u forget bout the movie today and Ill jus take you to see him. I was shocked when she said that too. So I was like ok, n the thing was she knew his mom wasnt home, well thats the part where she shocked me at, she actually let me go over my boyfriends house without and parents around. Well he had an interesting time there. Too bad we didnt have the fuzzy handcuffs or anything tasty around. Oh well maybe someother time.lol. But yea. Im bored now. haha the braces dont interfere either..lol..my aunt asked me that already before I had them on. It's pretty funny cuz my family keeps asking me does the braces interfere cuz Dann has braces too. I jus laugh at them. I still cant believe my mom asked the dentist that tho. Oh well. I guess Im gonna stop writing now.   _-Later-_
