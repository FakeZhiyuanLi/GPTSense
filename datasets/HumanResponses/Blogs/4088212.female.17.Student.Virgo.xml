      So happy about my fisrt blog. I am commemorating it with the phoenetic short fiction I wrote for ENC1101 and I am about to be 10 minutes late to class as usuall......  Even as Bob Marley’s redemption song blasted from Kimani’s radio, she heard from her mother callous comments along with brutal threats. Kimani always ran to her room at times like this and played “Redemption Song”, the CD her father gave her before he died, as a result she chased the“devil” of a mother away. The music soothed Kimani like warm water toaching bones, all the way to subterranean slumber. Today, heavy drops ofmoisture dribbled a miniscule path down her cheeks to her thin lips. Kimani examined her face in the mirror. Her puffy eyes and pointed noseappeared red on her delicate brown skin. She stared into the face of abeautiful young woman and wondered if she was unattractive as her mothermade her feel. Kimani pulled her long silky black hair away from herface, into a loose ponytail.  Her mother’s words slowly crept into Kimani’s thoughts, like a dagger aimed towards her heart.“Slut,” said her mother in patois, the heavy Jamaican accent, “Them bwoiya keep brigging in me yard are using ya, ya nasty bitch!” Kimani never snuck a boy into the woman’s house, except her boyfriend. Kimani’s mother never believed in her chastity. The thought of Amitbrought a smile to Kimani’s face. Amit was this tall and handsome cooly breed, which always had a cute wicked grin that made Kimani express sweet laughter. Amit and Kimani grew up as children, and she remembered him as a snotty nose nerd who matured into a charismatic intelligent young man. Kimani wiped her eyes, picked up the receiver, and dialed his number.  After the third ring Amit answered with his deep gentle voice, his way of asking what’s wrong, “Wassabi?” “Hey sweetie,” through her sniffles Kimani managed to say, “Where are you?” “I’m with the guys. Babe, what’s wrong?” Kimani hesitated, took a deep breath and told her story, “I came homefrom school and me muma talk about how I talk back to her. My motherthought I was being disrespectful and she said to me, I think I’m grown because I’ve been sleeping around”. She fought to hold back her tears. “What kind of shit is that?” Kimani heard the anger in Amit’s voice,“Why is she always abusing you? Why do you put up with it?” “What am I suppose to do? I live under my mother’s roof. She’s my mother. I mean…I don’t know, Amit. I don’t know.” “I don’t know what to tell you luv, lemme call you back,” with that said, Amit hung up the phone.  New tears of rage filled Kimani’s eyes. She slammed the phone and dived in her divan queen-sized bed. Kimani jumped when her sobs wereinterrupted by a thunderous kick on the bedroom door. The door swung open with a sound kick. There stood in the entrance way a short big-boned woman with a heated face. Kimani imagined the steam emanating from her mother and felt cold sweat run down her back, accelerating the beating thought…What now? Phaedra was a high tempered woman. After Kimani’s father died, Phaedra barely smiled. It took a few years before Kimani’s mother, Phaedra started dating; but, instead scared the men away with furious ways. “Ya slammed me door?” Did ya slam me bumba cloth door?” “No ma’am, me didn’t.” “Ya liar! That’s all ya good for. Telling me lies and causing me trouble. Get the hell outa me house!” Kimani sat there, not moving, staring at her mother. Kimani remained still on the bed, watching her mother’s lips move, not hearing a syllable. Phaedra slammed the door shut. Everything Kimani did was a misdeed in the house and she always felt like a slave girl at her mother’s bidding. The room was silent. The CD had reached its end and so did Phaedra’s bickering. Kimani place her head on the pillow and fell asleep.The Dell digital phone mused the beats of “make it clap”, Kimani pickedup the receiver. “Kimani,” euphemized Amit in a deep affectionate tone. “She did it again.” “Kimani, if I were you,” Amit began, “me gone from the house.” “If you were me, you’d have no where to go.” Kimani said in a deprecating tone. “Wassabi?”“Just woke up.” “I’m sorry about earlier. Are you feeling better?” “Yeeaa,” Kimani’s curvaceous lips turned up to a curvature, “What are you up to?” “Thinking about you.”  Kimani had her usual conversation of repartees and mild discussions….He’d be the perfect lawyer, she thought. Amit made Kimani happy. Kimani got off the phone, reached for a towel which hung over the closet door, and grabbed the bottle of shower gel. Kimani laid in a warm bubble bath and the thought of Amit brought a smile to her face.  “Wake up gyal! Me naw drive ya to school!” shouted Phaedra. Kimani hopped out of bed, took a shower, and dress as if a hurricane was moving in on her. She looked at her clock. It was 7:25. Kimani grabbed her book bag and ran out the front door. As she stepped foot on the sidewalk, the bus drove away down the street. Kimani turned to face Phaedra with her feet planted at the door laughing.“Why ya nuh chase the bus?” Phaedra called out, “Better yet, why ya nuh wake up early? Ya such a lazy gyal.” Kimani walked back into the residence. She knew better than to ask for a ride. Kimani secretly hoped Amit, who drive and live near Luke Lane School, didn’t leave his house yet.  “Ya think just because ya live down the street, they’ll wait for ya,” her mother continued. Pheadra followed Kimani into the den. “Who ya calling so early in themorning?” “A ride.” “Oh. Ya betta. Me nuh have time to go all the way to Luke Lane. Ya should know to wake up early”. “Why didn’t you wake me up?” Kimani mumbled. “What. What was that? Don’t get smart with me. Me in a good mood thismorning. Ya betta not ruin it for me.” With that, Phaedra walked away. Her heels clicked against the floor with attitude. Kimani picked up thephone in the den and dialed Amit’s number. “Hello?” Amit voice held comfort. “Mornin,” Kimani whispered, “Ya nuh wake yet?” “I am now. Wassabi?” “I missed the bus. I know it’s out of the way, but…” “Yeah, I’m coming. I’ll be there in 10 minutes. Alright?”Amit hung up the phone.  Then Kimani heard another click. Her mother burst into the den. “That had betta been a gyal with a male’s voice, cause ain’t nuh daughtaof mine riding in a car with no boy.” Kimani walked into the kitchen, opens the draw of utensils, and grasped the lifeless steel. She heard Phaedra’s heavy steps beat on the tiles. “Rude gyal, nuh walk away from me when me talk to ya,” Phaedra warned and grabbed Kimani by the shoulder. As Kimani turned to face Phaedra, warm liquid flowed down her wrist. Unmoving, Phaedra lay on the cold floor. A sharp pain seared Kimani’s heart… as moments passed by, until Amit walked through the front door into the kitchen.  “Kimani,” he said in a soothing voice.“Amit,” with a soundless cry, Kimani shaped his name to the movement of her lips. Deep inside, the pain bombarded Kimani, deepening her affliction. Kimani followed Amit and the dead burden to Montego River.  Kimani walked before her with a heavy demeanor, looked into the eyes of Amit when he said, “Everything will be alright”. To Kimani those precious words were incoherent. With all her strength, Kimani pulled the kayak next to the cascading brook of water waked by the wind. The sounds of the water echoed steady slaps. Kimani placed her dead burden, settled herself into the kayak, pushed herself off the shore, and stroked the surface of the river with forceful movements. On the shore, Amit stared after Kimani and dwindled into hopeless nonexistence at the sight of her departure.  Kimani braced herself. The waves pounded against the sides of the croaking wood. With her throat enclosed and heart encased, Kimani traveled upon the water that sparkled like broken glass. She breathed in shallow breaths and felt the moist ocean spray rolling down her cheek. A smile of insanity tugged at the corners of Kimani’s lips. The scenes passed her bye as if a minute or an hour were a second.  Unconscious of her destination, Kimani continued to fight the currents. The kayak thudded on the near embankment. Against its restraints, Kimani’s heart banged against her chest. Kimani stepped on dry land and looked at the black sky. It rained. The day turned into a down pour. Sounds of raindrops danced on the moist beaten earth. She looked into the kayak, within it resided the dead burden and the cold object. She picked up the lifeless steel. Kimani plunged the blade into the chambers of her heart. The sight of blood gushed forth on the water’s surface.
