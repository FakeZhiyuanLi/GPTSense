      Okay, I'm sure you readers have probably seen numerous articles about this site on other blogs, as well as my own.  But, if you haven't, lemme give you the lowdown on the downlow.  'TendOMFG is a blog that is currently maitained by 4 people: Nintaldo, TendOMFG, Specialist, and KingReginald.  There's a lot of speculation as to their age and sex, but I'm willing to put it at around 11 and most of them are girls.  Specialist is an ass-kisser, Nintaldo is retarded, TendOMFG doesn't really say much anymore, and KingReginald hasn't shown up for quite a while, especially when the debates after the articles get heated.  Most of us (us being the people who insult them and generally prove them wrong about everything) think that KingReginald, or Reggie, is a puss who doesn't have anything to back up.  At least he's smart enough to know that he's already lost before he even starts typing anything.   Also, these people are infamous for their idiotic and childish mock-names of other systems.  They use terms such as "Haystation Goo" and "Xbom" and "Gaylo" and "Getta Life 2."  WHY?  Because they're morons.  Plain and simple as that.  Hardly any of the rest of us use those kind of immature terms to describe other systems, because most of us are generally pretty cool with all three systems.  Personally, I don't care much for GC (except for playing Smash Bros), but I don't hate it and make fun of it.  Instead, they're all biased fanboys who then go off and call EVERYONE ELSE a "biased fanboy," even though we all have played lots of games on all three systems and can make complete judgements about all three.   ...Which leads me to my next point.  These kids only say what Nintendo wants them to say.  They probably read Nintendo Power, which I can only describe as propaganda.  I used to read it avidly, but now I look at them and go, "Wow.  I can't believe I used to read this and believe it."  NP was made so that Nintendo could try to keep their fanbase and have them still brainwashed and under their control.  These 'TendOMFG kids are completely unable to form their own independently decided opinions about the games they play; instead they say that only Nintendo games are any good.  ...Which is pretty much what Nintendo Power tells you.  Someone put up an analogy on the  forums after an article ( I think it was MacDjinn...correct me if I'm wrong, please.  I gotta give credit to whoever deserves it.).  He said that most gamers have relationships with their consoles that kinda resemble being in love with someone.  You like them, but can recognize their strenghts and weaknesses and acknowledge that they exist.  You can disagree with some things, but still keep a good opinion about them.  In contrast, most Nintendo fanpeople, especially the ones at 'TendOMFG, are like a 4-year-old to its mother.  They never question anything, they always take everything for its face value, they can never see any wrong, and anything that Mother says is right.  It's very true when you think about it, really.  They also seem to have the maturity and IQ of a 4-year-old, that's for sure.   Ee all keep trying in vain to tell them that there's more than just Nintendo out there.  There are plenty of other awesome games to choose from on other consoles.  But these people just can't accept it.  They have such devoted loyalty, it's almost religious.  I find it sickening.  Go devote your life to God, not Nintendo.  He'll reward you for it.

      Y'know, with all this current crap about the console wars, 'TendOMFG, aliens invading, and Halo 2 coming out to show the world that Bungie will soon be taking over, it leads me to think of the one company who's been around the longest: Nintendo.  Their games are the stuff of legends, their reputation is (or, at least, was) well-respected, their name was known worldwide.  They were once the epitome of video gaming.  Now, due to several terrible mistakes,  Nintendo is taking a turn for the worst.   Let's rewind to the early 90's, if you will.  The SNES (in my opinion, the best console of all time) ruled all, with the Sega Genesis offering some stiff competetion.  Nintendo had everything going for it; awesome games, great developers, and soaring sales figures.  Now, fast forward to today and what do you see?  A company with barely any third-party support, a bitter loss of a trusted second-party developer to Microsoft, free-falling sales figures and a much reduced fanbase.  What happened?  How did the King of Video Games become what may soon be another Sega?  Here, I hope to explain some of my reasoning as to why this is.  Nintendo's first mistake:  The PlayStation Project.  Originally concieved as an add-on to the SNES, Nintendo teamed up with Sony to make a disc-based super-console that was to smash all competition.  Sony was very eager to team up with a well-respected partner to make a quality system that, at the time, produced unheard of fully-3D graphics and cause jaws to drop across the world.  All was going well until the day that it was to be announced to the world.  That morning, before the press conference, Nintendo backed out of the project.  Sony, angry and bitter, went on to make their PlayStation, and are now proving themselves to not only be a major rival in the console war, but the Heirs to the Video Game Throne.  Already, the PlayStation and PS2 have racked up impressive sales and are currently the dominator in the current Console War.  Big mistake, Nintendo.  Think of how much better off you'd be if you wouldn't have backed out of something that turned out to be a huge competitor.  Nintendo's second mistake:  Retaining the cartridge format for the N64.  The high costs of developing and manufacturing the cartridges, not to mention the glaring limitations in both storage capability and digital quality, where what cost Nintendo almost all of its third-party support.  Sure, it had some quality titles like Goldeneye and Perfect Dark, but good games were few and far-between.  Frustrated developers left in favor of the PlayStation and its disc format, where much larger games could be created for a fraction of the production costs.  Nintendo is still paying for it.  While they've gained a few supporters back, like Capcom, many third-party developers still remain skeptical about working with Nintendo.  Nintendo's third mistake: Almost complete lack on online play.  At an E3 conference, they said something like "we don't try to make online games because we don't think that anyone will want to play them."  Yeah, try telling that to the enormous amount of Xbox Live subscribers.  Instead of being smart and making multiplayer internet games (with the exception of Phantasy Star Online), they went off and toted about the idea of connecting the Game Boy Advance to the GameCube.  There aren't many of these games out, and most people STILL would rather play online.  Bad idea, Nintendo.  Nintendo's biggest problem now: all their fans have grown up.  They're still aiming for the 4-10 crowd when a good majority of their fanbase has gotten older and grown tired of the childish image Nintendo presents.  While some of them may check back to see what's going on in the big N, and even fewer are still crazy enough to want to stay around (like the morons at 'TendOMFG), I'm willing to bet that the majority of their former fanbase are now playing Grand Theft Auto and Halo on their PS2s and Xboxes, respectively.  I say this because I am a former Nintendo fanboy, who finally grew up and saw that there was more to be offered out there.  I'm speaking from personal experience.  Nintendo is aiming for the wrong market right now.  The video game industry has matured a lot in the past 10 years, and so have its players.   My message to Nintendo--pull your heads out of your asses!  You guys are still more than capable of making great games (I'm getting my hopes up for the next Zelda that's gonna be coming out soon.  It looks good enough to almost make me wanna buy a 'Cube for it.), but you're wasting all of your time and money trying out things that will never find a firm foothold in today's industry.  Please, Nintendo, I beg of you!  Otherwise, I have a strong feeling that history will repeat itself and you'll turn out just like Sega: still alive, but only as a game developer.    (note: this article was written based on my opinions and knowledge of Nintendo's history.  Please don't flame me for criticizing Nintendo, even though I think that they've already had their prime and that there isn't much left in 'em unless they change their strategy.  I was just expressing my opinion and forecasting what I think will happen to them.  History repeats itself.  But, still, I'd like to know what you think!  Casey out.)

      Well, time for review number two.  XIII.  Or, Thirteen in Roman Numerals.  Ever since I saw the screens for this game in EGM I was interested.  I thought it looked cool.  My friend bought it and he let me borrow it, so I can now write a full review on it.  Story: It's quite intriguing, actually.  It's done in a flashback-style presentation, and more and more of Agent XIII's past comes up as you progress through the game.  You slowly begin to remember what's going on and why there are people out to kill you.  Also, there was a HUGE twist and cliffhanger at the end, and I'm hoping they make a sequel so I can see how the story turns out. This was what motivated me to get through the gameplay, which is only so-so. 9/10  Main Character: XIII is around a 7 on the cool factor.  He doesn't look all that awesome, but he's got cool skills and he's out with a venegance.  So I'll give him a 7/10.  Graphics:  All I can say about 'em is STYLISH.  The game is cel-shaded and does a great job of making you feel like you're in a comic book.  There are little "tap tap tap"s when you see someone walking, a big bloody 'AAUG!" when you shoot someone, and 'BAOOM!' when you blow something up.  Very cool.  Also, there's an awesome little mini-cutscene every time you get a headshot on someone or shoot them off a cliff, presented in comic-book panel fashion.  The polygon count is a little on the low side, but the visuals are very clean and practically jaggy-free. 9/10  Audio:  Great.  Stylish, 60's-era spy music, cartoony gun effects, and great voice work by Adam West (booya!), David Duchovny, and Eve.  9/10  Gameplay:  Here's where the game takes a major hit.  It's nothing special, and sometimes is just downright frustrating.  XIII seems to die too easily, and all the enemies have no problem capping you in the head with consistency.  They NEVER seem to miss.  That, and they're made of Kevlar.  It takes an absurd amount of hits to take 'em down (unless, of course, you peg 'em with the crossbow).  The free-look is, in my opinion, too slow.  You can change the X-axis sensetivity, but not the Y-axis (for reasons unbeknownst to me).  You can have a quick side-to-side look, but when you try and look up it's still sluggish.  I didn't like that too much.  Multiplayer isn't all that great (granted, I haven't tried it out on  XB Live yet so I don't have the full experience), but there is ONE small saving grace that I thought was kinda cool.  As you progress in the game, you "remember" your old abilities such as dual-weilding and being able to hold your breath for a long time.  It's kinda like an RPG in that sense.  But it still isn't enough to make me really wanna raise the score at all.  5/10  Replay:  Well, not that high.  Unless you have XB Live, that is, even though I'm sure there are more people out there playing Pandora Tomorrow and Rainbow Six 3.  3/10  Overall Score (I average all the other scores I gave it, by the way): 7/10.  Maybe I oughta change my scoring policy.  From now on, if it's an 8 or higher go out and buy it.  Otherwise, rent it first.  This game would just be a rental, though.

      Okay, first and foremost-- I'm only gonna review games that I've played through all the way.  Right now I'm playing through Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow and KOTOR, but I haven't completed them so I can't say anything just yet.  Anyhow, back to the review.  I'm a Tom Clancy nut.  I'd buy his games even if they sucked just 'cause of the label.  But this game is a great game anyways.   Story: It's not bad.  The whole idea of the little obscure country of Georgia becoming a major threat to the U.S. is kinda absurd,  but it wass interesting enough to hold my attention and keep me playing in the game to see how it turned out.  I'm a total story whore, and I believe that it adds a lot to the gameplay experience, so I tend to rate it pretty strictly.  I'm gonna give it a 7/10  Graphics: Hoo, boy.  Some of the most awesome lighting effects EVER.  It's entertaining just to shoot a lamp and watch the light dance all about the room from its swinging.  The shadows are dark, the light is very bright and yells "DON'T GO HERE!!", and the textures are awesome.  My only beef is that a few of the parts on Sam Fisher's character model are a little rough and polygon-y, but that's about it.  Also, the goggle effects rock.  Night vision is kinda grainy and washed-out looking, and thermal is able to sense the differences in temperature and can even see through some things.  Also cool: when you kill someone and you're looking at 'em through thermal, their body heat slowly fades as they die away.  AWESOME! 9.5/10 (the character models need a little more smoothing up)  Main Character: this is actually something I rate a game on.  And I gotta say, Sam Fisher is only second to the Master Cheif.  Sam Fisher is just plain BADASS.  He has a way cool voice (expertly done by Micheal Ironside from Starship Troopers and Total Recall) and he just looks like he could kill you with his pinky finger.  He's got a little gray around the temples, so he's older and more experience.  Plus, his main gun, the F2000, is a descendent of my favorite gun ever, the P90.  More bonus points to him.   10/10  Gameplay: It's pretty fun.  You can run-and-gun through a level (if it's one where you're allowed to kill), but things will be much harder for you.  If you sneak with the shadows and even make your own, things are much easier and also much cooler.  Each level is challenging, and most usually have multiple ways you can figure out how to complete an objective.  This also adds to replay value. 9/10  Music: All in all, I'd say it's pretty good.  The intro song, "Name of the Game," was written by Tom Morello.  He's my guitar hero, and he's got some awesome writing abilities, so it adds bonus points for me.  The music picks up when an enemy spots you, and gets more and more intense as you progress into evasion and combat.  To me, the best music by far is on the last level. 9.5/10  Replay: It's moderately high.  It's fun to go back and see all the different ways you can try to beat a level.  8/10  Final Score: 8.8/10  Anything that gets a 7.5 or higher means GO BUY IT!  Soon to come: Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow, KOTOR, Halo, Metal Gear Sold 2: Substance, Ghost Recon, and XIII

      Okay, well, this is gonna be my first post.  I'd like to point out a blog on this site called TendOMFG.  It's a site that was created by these 4 people (I still haven't decided sex or age...you'll see what I mean) who are complete idiots.  All they do in any of their posts is set themselves up to be contradicted and flamed by all the other people out there with functioning logical analyzing capabilities.  They think that NINTENDO is the allmighty God who rules all, and any and everything that comes out of it is nothing but Holy Awesome.  They gave a Hamtaro game a 10/10 for Cripes' Sake!  But, you all should see the link and check out what these idiots are saying, it's good for a laugh and some anger venting.  Plus, it's a nice place to try and test out your debating skills, and it's fun to contradict them and see what they say.   Anywho, check it out!    urlLink http://tendomfg.blogspot.com/
