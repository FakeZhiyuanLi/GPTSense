      Alrighty! That's it...I need to make myself a routine in which I will stick too everyday (cept for the weekends) =p Umm...lets see..I have to wake up SUPER early in the morning (at about 5)..go to school to teach Maganda Tsai A+, then I have to go to work from 11 to 5, get home...and do housework for about an hour..then Im free at 7 o'clock and brokeass tired...LoL! Who would have thought that this is the "real world"...? Certainly not me..now...seeing Kathy everyday is real...but other  than that, work sucks, and I've neever had this much time be consumed like this...I'm looking forward to making a routine however, cause if I do the same things everyday like...work out..and impress my mom by doing house chores...I'll be able to BEAST school next year much much much more easily! Woo Wooo! So I guess Im pumped...The other day Freddie (one of my bosses) surprized me by getting me a 24 pack of Dew and sticking it in the fridge...now I can freely take a dew whenever I need it (yes need)...cause I must preserve the special green beverage to stay awake every day...Tis a blessing...WOO! Welp...Chris came over the other day and checked out the Mitsubishi...he said it kicks...and that Im a lucky bastard...and he's jelious...and Im not gonna even brag about it...cause I feel like a rich little white kid...but I'm not in the inside...and I want to continue being modest..and not flaunt...cause my ass "WILL" get robbed one day if I do...or ever did..lol! welp...crazy crazy day yesterday..went to work...failed to get to school to teach Kathy...I feel like I totally let her down..but I don't think its a biggy...my mom was on percasets and couldnt drive...and well..she was really pissy and stuff...just part of getting your FACE ripped off and having to go get plastic surgery...hmm...welp, I managed to clean my room half way yesterday...I put up banners on the slanted walls cause Chris i s a damn genius, and I moved all my furniture in place...soooo all I have to do now is just move all the shit that's on the floor onto the shleves and stuff! ^_^ Welp...gotta jet..see yah laters!

      It's the end of the day with about 15 minutes left of work...Mike called me and wanted to know what time to call later on....my mom is going to pick me up in the Mitsubishi...but I dunno...Im quite skeptical about the car...if it's for me, then I think that the entire thing will be alright with both my parents...however...if my mom is keeping it, and lets me drive the olds or something...then BLAH! It's like..she's spending money that she didnt need to spend if its not for me..and it's kinda no fair for my dad since the two havent gone to court or done anything of that nature yet...Welp...I'm out! BAIS!

      My mom bought a Mitsubishi 3000GT without telling my dad...cause everything she buys after the settlement is hers.... O_o OMG! I'm almost certainly sure that this car is for me...cause my mom....c'mon..! She drives an Oldmobile! and besides..I need a car anyway...I thought I was going to get the Honda...but I guess I'll be ricing out this Mitsubishi with a bombing sound system, body kits, and other stuff! I can't wait to tell my sensei in cars, Chris...wonder if he'll think its cool or not...I still don't know much about cars....so I need to see what I can do to it and if it is fast or not....Ohh well...we shall see when I get back home and start organizing my room! I have to unscrew all that crap on my futon, then rebuild it in the backroom...and another thing! I need to go buy my very own fish, like tetras and stuff...I want colorful fish...and all we have in that 20 gal tank are guppies and such...BORING....welp..Im off to the Tech Center! Wish me luck!

      Haha! This is funny...I'm over at the H2 building of Ferguson Ent. and I cleaned all of Russ's routers/switches and pretty much have nothing to do here! Soooo..in response to this, I'll be working at the Tech Center down on Warwick for the rest of the week...I'm a beast when it comes to work! Welp...I think it's pretty funny actually...Alrighty! Bai bai!

      Ohh boy ohh boy...What ever am I going to do? Man...I hate it how my parents are gonna have a divorce. I went through depression HELL for about 8 months, but now I am back to my coooool bad self! ^_^ Over the weekend I moved my dad out into his apartment, which is in Hampton, and did some heavy lifting with the furniture. My brother helped too, but I feel kinda sad since we did everything on Father's Day. On Father's Day, which was Sunday, I went to the movies with my dad, bro, and Chris...we saw Dodgeball with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn...and it was HILARIOUS! Go see it if you can...anyway...My mom dropped me off at work today, and I'm just chillin til I get my next cluster of work (I'm a hard worker..HUA!) Umm...Before my mom dropped me off, she menchined that she bought a Mitsubishi 3000GT! I need to contact Chris, because this car is very well going to be mine...I must see if I can rice it out or do anything to it to really make it something else...perhaps add a turbo, sound system, body kit, and a faster engine!...We'll see what happens...buuuut...My dad was planning on giving me the Honda, however, it works for him...I don't know whats happening! Welp..bai bai you'all!
