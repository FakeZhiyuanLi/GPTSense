      look at the resemblance between bill clinton's mom and monica lewinsky in these photographs from a  time  magazine i stole from the expresslube while the changed the tranny fluid in my yak.  isnt the resemblance uncanny?  i suppose he had relations with her on account of she looked like his mom and he has an oedipus complex.  *note: i can't be sued for libel on account of i was just supposing.

      you know something?  i though blogger was pure.  xanga is so very sick, contaminated with the babble of people who write alot, but dont say anything, people who add slow-loading 190,000* kbps music files from their flourescent, stereotypical, impossible-to-read formatted blogs, and people who abuse letter/number substitutions and have a spastic caps lock key. unfortunately, there is no cure for dumbass. blogger has been contaminated.  i have only seen one page so far, a 0 for an o, a typical "[cap][lowercase[cap][lower]..." pattern, and the site was about what?  nothing.  i am not mean, i will not link.  but this makes me sad, i like blogger.  now it has internet leoprosy.  how sad!

      i am back from pismo, and i have hardly any  urlLink pictures .&nbsp; i think that's because i only photograph certain situations that i find funny, and that is hard to predict.&nbsp; there are some candid ones i am somewhat proud of though.&nbsp; the trip was killer!

      okay, the movie as a whole, well, was somewhat lacking.  it definetely had its moments, but the character that made it all worthwhile was Brick, the weatherman.   "hi, i'm brick.  someday, a doctor will tell me i have an I.Q. of 48, and will be considered by some to be mentally retarded." (mind you, he is filling a plugged-in toaster with mayonaise [sp?] as he says this.)
