      I just got home from seeing MIB II - pretty neat sequel - really wasnt anything new in the movie. Just continued the story. TV ruined most of it though. Most of the funny parts I have already seen in trailers for the film. People were still laughing though. I wonder if those people even watch TV. Because after the 5th time.. its really not that funny anymore.  My boyfriend isnt home from work yet.  :(  Hopefully he wont be too much longer.

      woo what a day - people at work are all about taking vacations around this time and its killing me. Next week is going to be worse because thats when we make up for the time lost on the holiday. blah I'm ready for another exciting friday night...really. I never have anything to do. My boyfriend works at night until sometime after 11. So I usually just get to chill here. Unless I get a phone call. Most of my friends are married or have kids.. so they cant/wont go out. Here I am.. single.. very capable of going out.. but I dont. Maybe Ill make some phone calls this evening.  July 4th was cool. got to hang out with some friends i only see once in a while. Maybe i should call them more.

      this comes out of my estrostep fe package -  'Missed mestrual periods for both dosage regimens At times there may be no mestrual period after a cycle of pills. Therefore, if you miss one mestrual period but have taken the pills exactly as you were supposed to, continue as usual into the next cycle.'  So thats it then... I'm fine  :)

      i went to a friends house yesterday and took a pregnancy test - fortunatly it came up negative. But I still havent started. I will prolly make an appt with my Dr in the next few weeks for a blood test. Maybe my estrogen levels are too low or something. I dont know. Mike thinks it my tae bo. He was releived to hear that I came up negative too. But he seemed a little more at ease about the whole baby thing then last time this happened to me. I guess its because he is older. That was like 4 years ago.   Last night I went to  urlLink Lynch's Irish Pub  for a few beers with some old friends from my previous job. It was a lot of fun.  urlLink Little Green Men   was there. Great 80s cover band.   Today is my dad's 52nd birthday. He has already made plans so I dont get to take him out or anything. I dont have any money to do that anyway.  I'll be sure to give the house a call around 6 or so to say Happy Birthday. I'll take him out next weekend or something.

      lunch break time - im not eating anything though, i had a muffin for breakfast and I'm leaving here at 1:30 anyway so I'll eat something at home. I dont know what to do this afternoon. Maybe I'll go down to the pool and relax. Hopefully relaxing this afternoon will bring upon what every girl expects every month. blah - I only have 2 more days left before I am spozed to start another pack of pills. i take those damn things at the exact same time every frikken morning - never ever missed one. If they failed me.. i'm going to be pretty upset. If they didnt.. I'm just going to stop having sex so I dont have to think about it anymore.

      ok so i went to leave work today... and realized that I locked my keys in my car.  Dumbass I called my friend Jenna and she came to pick me up. We had to stop by Mike's work so I could get a house key.  So, I'm home. And I found my spare key. I let Jenna go because she has a family and junk and I didnt want to take up her evening. So now my friend Ted is going to bring me to my car when he gets off work since my sister wasnt home to do it.  :/ Tonight was spozed to be a relaxing night too. I think I am losing my mind. I forget my watch and cell phone this morning AND locked the keys in the car. Sheesh. Hope this isnt a sign of something.

My friend Laurie had a baby last night. Christopher Tyler Johnson weighing in at 8lbs 11oz!  Big baby boy! I am so happy for her and Scott. They are going to be wonderful parents.

      just got off the phone from talking to my sister for the past 45 min or so.. she said that my dad had water in his lungs er something and that if they let him go home he would have another heart attack. Maybe I should see about leaving work early tomorrow to go to the hospital and check things out. hear it from the doctor.  Most of the conversation was me confessing all my past drug uses and experiences to her. hehe  I think i scared her  :)  i want to know why my face is broke out like im a 13 yr old - you would think my hormones would be under control - I hate when its brown pills week

      Well another weekend gone... nothing exciting happened. Yesterday, we left the house to go have some lunch at Panera and did not return until around 11pm that evening. After Panera, we drove down A1A to St. Augustine. Didnt stop or anything, just drove through. Then we went to the outlet mall. .I got a new wallet. After that we came back to Jacksonville and stopped by my friend Jenna's house to return her FFX game and get our GTA3 game. Well, we ended up staying for dinner. Mike and Jenna's husband went to Dick's Wings for some chicken wings. The rest of the evening we just hung out.  Today.. we were asked to go to the beach.. but Mike didnt want to go. Instead we went to BJs and Publix. That pretty much covers today. I spent too much money at Publix today but we needed the food. I only have $1 to last me until my next pay check! hehe At least I bought gas yesterday. I'll have to get money from Mike if I need some. I should be alright. I need to go kick him off the PS2 so I can do my  urlLink tae bo

      I went to the beach today with my friend Jenna and her family. Mike went golfing. My legs are all sunburnt on the top - it looks pretty stupid.. hehe. i hadnt been to the beach in a while. I forgot how much fun it could be. Jenna  had the whole setup. The umbrella, chairs, blanket, cooler - everything you need. She even has a cart to haul all this stuff back and forth. Pretty fancy.

       urlLink Quiz: What kind of lover are you?   Tender Doe   You value intimacy and you prefer that it remain private. You will never be caught red-handed flirting intensively; it just isn't your style. On the other hand, you have a quality that's really appreciated by the opposite sex: you are a faithful and devoted lover and you tend to build up an ideal image of your man.  Still, you're not really a sexual beast, as you're able to contain sensual drives. You don't much like taking sexual initiatives, and the soft caresses of foreplay are always your favourite moments of love-making. When it comes to sex itself, you're very much a traditionalist. You're not inclined towards experimentation—whether it involves watching erotic films or trying out new positions—and you're not likely to make a huge amount of noise either. Yet, this doesn't mean that you don't enjoy sex or that you're incapable of feeling pleasure. For you, it's more about the emotions than it is the physical sensations.

It was alright I guess. Nothing else on.   we had soy burgers for dinner. the first bite was okay.. but after awhile.. it just made you want to barf. I wouldnt recommend them. that was our attempt at eating healthy. hehe

      dont you hate it when you dream about old friends from high school and you just want to see them again now.  Tony Layton was in my dream last night. He is the cousin of my high school crush -Noah Pierce. I had a dream about Noah the other day. Man I miss him. I saw him at the  urlLink warped tour  either last year or the year before. Maybe I will see him again this year.  :)

      So I went to Mandys house this evening. No reason really. Just no one else to hang out with I guess. So she made me watch The Emporers New Groove. It was cute. Not as good as Monsters Inc though. I cant wait until that comes out on DVD.  :)

      "Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so. How do I know? For this is what I have done. And I am Caesar." - - Julius Caesar

After dinner we went to books a million and visited Mike. :)  He looks so cute in that apron. hehe. Then we headed to Bowl America for some cosmic bowling. She kicked my butt! Then we came home and I kicked her butt at Scrabble. I have to work tomorrow morning. I know that I wont want to get up. But I offered to do some overtime.. so away I go!

      What another wasteful weekend this is turning out to be. Sometimes I would rather be at work then just sitting here on my ass - or laying on the couch falling in and out of sleep. There is just nothing to do.   :(  I was just out at the beach visiting my parents. Not on purpose or anything. I had to pick up my mom and bring her home from memorial hospital. its a long story and i dont want to go into it. I got all my vegas presents though. that was nice of them.

      I am such a mess. I have been so upset and depressed this evening its driving me crazy. I guess it started when Mike called me from work this evening asking me about a house we had been looking at. I told him that I dont think that we are ready to buy a house. And he said that he wasnt talking about "we" he was talking about either him or I buying it. And I guess that just hurt me. So I told  him to do what he wants... I dont plan on buying a house alone. I cant afford that. I cant afford anything.  Now I have my Med Lab teacher trying to get me to take a class in the fall. But if I take one of her classes I have to drop another that I am already signed up for. She says she would like me to take at least one med lab class a term so she can "keep tabs on me". I guess I feel like I will hurt her feelings if I tell her no.. or even when I do the switch to nursing.  I am having lunch with Jeanne tomorrow. Its going to be nice to hang out with her again. I havent seen her since July 4th. But somehow in my day tomorrow after lunch, I have to go to my parents house, go to school, and go grocery shopping. (With what money) Ha! Its transfer funds out of the ole savings account day. then most of my next paycheck goes to paying myself back with interest. Doesnt make too much sense does it. I always end up taking it back out.  So I'm not doing my tae bo again tonight. I'm just too sad. I was spozed to lose so much weight doing this too. To me I look the same. A scale said I lost 10lbs. that was a few weeks ago. I think i have gained it all back. Whatever. I'm over it.

      ok so i am crazy mad sunburnt again - we went to the Warped Tour yesterday. None of the good bands came on until after 6 o clock and we had been there since 12 out in the hot ass sun with no shade. I even had on sun block. But Im still a lobster. It sucks.   I got my tickets for the cruise today. Less than a month to go!!! I was looking at all the neat things you can buy now and have waiting in your room for you when you got there. Just let me know if you want to send me a bon voyage gift.. hehe  I havent done my tae bo.. going on day 3.  :(   Didnt do it yesterday because of the warped tour, sunday i didnt do it because.. well i just didnt do it, Mike was playing playstation and stuff. And Saturday we had a party to go to so I didnt have the time. and well today.. well duh I have a sunburn and it kills me to walk. You actually think that I am going to jump and kick and squat?!? You can forget that noise. Ill try to do it tomorrow...maybe... I need to.. blah.

      Didn't do much of anything today. I went to Lynches last night with some friends and got smashed. So I stayed in bed for a while today waiting for my headache to stop. After that i went to the mall and got mike some new swim trunks. They were 50% off. Then I went with him to get new tires at BJs and watched Dont Say a Word after that. We just got back from Applebees for dinner. Now its bed time.  :)

      Don't you hate it when you forget your cell phone? My purse is all light. And now of course I am going to miss a phone call. No one ever calls it when I have it on me.    I had something else to blah about but I dont remember what it was.   Tomorrow is payday! YaY!  I was just balancing my check book..I am about $250 in the hole due to some checks I put in the mail today. Damn bills. Thats not even all of them either. I only wrote them and sent them off because money will be in my account tomorrow. I also had to buy stamps and gas this morning. Thank goodness for the credit card feature on debit cards. That at least gives you a day or two to get the money in your account. And its also better for the credit union. Makes us money. Dont ask me how.. thats just what they say.   I plan on going to Lynches Friday night with a few friends from my old job. I'm still tossing around the idea of taking a cab out there so I can get my drink on. Mike is working so its not like he can drive. Maybe I can find a ride out there and just take a cab home. That would be cheaper. hmmm...

      What good are these comments if they are always offline. I think I was able to read them once. And they make my blog take longer to load. What a pain.  I just got back from the dentist. I didnt want a cleaning but they did it anyway. Turns out I need to get 4 fillings Monday morning. I originally made the appt because I had one tooth that has been bothering me. I knew there was a cavity there. The dentist and chick who did the x-ray said.. no.. we dont see anything. It wasnt until after the cleaning and the dentist came in and did the scaling that she realized there was one there. Just a little one. Same with all my others. Little baby ones. Hopefully she wont have to drill and just use that air pressure thing. Still I hate getting fillings because it messes your bite all up. My mouth still tastes like flouride. I ate a hotdog from edco express and now i am drinking some lemonade. Still isnt getting this taste out of my mouth. yuck  Tomorrow is my birthday. Going to turn 24 on the 24th. I better get something good. hehehe

      So I think this guy at work has a crush on me or something. He just acts all awkward around me. This morning he came to my desk and said "good morning beautiful" and nnow I have this piece of candy on my desk.. that no one else has.. so whatever. I guess its flattering or its all in my head.  I have to go take that lab final soon. Ive been trying to find some time to look at the photos in between things that I am doing.  My dad just called me about my birthday. The plan originally was that we all went out to dinner. Dad, mom, maybe jessica and mike. Dad said he thought about it last night and said that its not everyones birthday on saturday so he shouldnt have to take everyone out. So now me and him and going to dinner and a movie. I sent Mike and email about it .. i'm sure he could go if he pays his own way. I hope he didnt have any other plans.

      I was just reading over some of my parisitology notes that my teacher puts up on the web. She says: "Several years ago, I went on a cruise to Cozumel and Cancun. The couple that were at my table on the ship decided to eat while they were ashore - they had nachos at a resturant that the ship had said was safe. Two months later, the woman became paralyzed on one side - they did imaging studies and found cysticercus in her brain. They administered Praziquantel and also steroids because when the larva dies, it creates massive inflammation. She recovered fully but was in the hospital about a month - the paralysis took longer to resolve. She missed 4 months of work. Sanitation in Cozumel and Cancun is terrible and this is a very common problem. If you visit there be very carefuk about eating and drinking ashore."  I will have to keep that in mind.

Kelly was amazing as always and Tamyra and Justin.. they just were not at their best. I voted for Justin anyway because .. well. I'm just not ready to see him go. I think Kelly has a good chance in winning. Her voice is always amazing.

      I bought a deep fryer yesterday. We made fried chicken. It was really good.  Today at work I should have been called the Work Leader due to everything I had to do. Instead our real work leader sat on her ass. For example, I had to train this guy on how to balance atm bags .. thats the work leaders job.. not mine. I dont get paid the big bucks. But I did it anyway.  :P

      My teeth are buggin me. I got 4 fillings yesterday and so my bite is all whacked up. It takes a while for your brain to realize that this is just how your bite is going to be now. If i'm not used to it by thursday, i plan on going back to the dentist to get these fillings shaven down some.   I might be able to get off work at 5 instead of 6 on Friday. But i prolly wont know until friday. No biggie.   My written final is on the web. So that means its OPEN BOOK!!!   YaY!!! hehehe  Guy that I think has a crush on me just sent me an email, it says " btw, i didnt want to say in front of everyone else, but your hair is nice. I like it."  So I responded and said thanks. He responded back and said "for you anytime!"  blah blah blah

      So yesterday I went to Outback with my dad and then to a movie. We saw Blue Crush. We wanted to see Signs but it was sold out. Blue Crush was okay. Watching the waves was the best part of the movie. The story was pretty lame.   Mike gave me $100 dollars for my bday. So today we went to the outlet mall. I got a new watch. I still have about $60 left to spend on myself. Dunno what I'll get. Maybe a new work outfit. Or i'll save it for the cruise.   We are both super excited about the cruise next week. Thats like all we have talked about all day today. We have just been busy planning what we will do and just whatever. We are excited!  My sister said she will pay to get my other ear pierced as my gift. Thats cool and all. Just dont know when I will get it done.   Mike also took me to Olive Garden tonight for dinner. It was yummy. I havent ate at Olive Garden in a long time. we talked about our upcoming vacation the whole time. hehe  Well I have to go finish folding laundry....

      Kind of freaky: http://www.msnbc.com/news/807167.asp?pne=msn  So my mother is in the hospital again. She had a sezure yesterday. The sezure was a symptom of withdrawal from Ativan   Her and my father both have either ran out or are running out of their meds. My dad could possibly lose his oxygen machine too. All because my sister turned 18.. so Medicaid wont cover them anymore. Sucks huh? My parents are going to die before they should because they are too poor to afford medical insurance.

      Ya know, its cool and all that they are doing the rememberences of Sept 11 2001 today. I mean, its the one year anniversary. I was listening to WBS in Atlanta for coverage and a chick here had on either the radio or a TV for the coverage. After 9am, I turned it off. But Mary still had hers going. They were in the middle of reading the names of those who died when a lady came on and read a little thing about her dad who worked at the World Trade Center. It was so sad. It made me start thinking about all those families who got messages on their answering machine from their loved ones shortly before they died. I wonder if they kept those messages just so they can hear their loved one's voice again. It just kills me. I can't stop getting all emotional about it. Blah. Today will be a long day. I'm sure Psychology class will be all about this junk tonight. I just want to go back to bed.

      I guess that I should get back into the habit of blogging. I've been too busy day dreaming about my next vacation or moving to South Florida.  Today is my 1st day back to school. I have Chemistry tonight from 5 - 9:30.  :( Tomorrow I have Psychology 6-8:50 and Chemistry again on Thursday. These classes are going to be a lot of work. I need to get it done. Ive been going to school for like 6 years now. It seems like I'm never going to finish.  I'm pretty tired. I hope I make it to class on time. They are letting me leave at 4:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. As long as the Matthews isnt backed up, I dont see a problem. I've been thinking about taking the Heart Bridge because it doesnt get backed up, but University and Atlantic and University and Beach gets pretty backed up too. And you have all those lights. So it could be the same. Who knows. I want to go to Disney World this weekend. I need to remember to tell Mike thats what I want to do this weekend. We have no other plans. *o*

      Happy Weekend! Isnt it amazing that Sept is almost over already??  So last night Mike and I went to  urlLink Zaxbys  and got some chicken wings. We like the Nuclear kind. I would eat there every night if I could. Oh and we got some quarts from the Gate Station.  As we ate dinner we watched Monsters Inc.   It wasn't as funny as the 1st time we saw it. But, it was still good. I also bought a new DVD player last night. We have been watching the DVDs on our PS2. The PS2 just doesnt play all my DVDs. Either they skip around or the PS2 just doesnt play them at all. Its nice to have a real DVD player for a change. :)  Today, I have been busy doing homework and junk. I need to clean up the house some but I'm too lazy. Maybe tomorrow. We just got back from Blockbuster. We rented Madden 2003 and Ecco the Dolphin. I plan on making cheeseburger pie for dinner. I really would like some chicken wings though. heheh

      The Friday Five   1. Would you say that you're good at keeping in touch with people? yeah, the people I choose to stay in touch with, I usually do   2. Which communication method do you usually prefer/use: e-mail, telephone, snail mail, blog comments, or meeting in person? Why? E-mail - its fast, easy and available all day   3. Do you have an instant messenger program? How many? Why/why not? How often do you use it?  I use AOL Instant Messenger. Thats the only one. I use it because I once had an AOL account so I can keep my screenname.   4. Do most of your close friends live nearby or far away? They all live about 15 mins away. I live in the middle of everything. :)  5. Are you an "out of sight, out of mind" person, or do you believe that "distance makes the heart grow fonder"? hmmm... I would say most of the time its "out of sight, out of mind" but I have been known to follow "distance makes the heart grow fonder"

      Sometimes I wish I could just have a normal family. Or somewhat close to normal. Maybe what I have is normal. I dont know. My dad has started talking to this chick he cheated on my mom with about 10 years ago again. She lives in Michigan and I think is like 10 or 12 years younger than he is. I actually think it was more than 10 years ago. So, yeah he is talking to her again. She has called the house and everything so my mom knows. I was going through his emails last night trying to figure out what files he has downloaded. (He had a worm and 3 viruses btw) I found his responses to emails from her. He plans on going up there for Thanksgiving and wants to see her. I know he is unhappy in his current situation. He has been for a long time. But, ugh.. I dunno. I guess since Jessica and I are grown it shouldnt matter that much. But what about my mom? She cant live on her own. I know her family doesnt want her dumped onto them. Kinda sad to think that no one wants her. She wouldnt want to move back to Mass anyway. blah. I guess I cant look forward to my parents coming to visit me someday at my house and enjoying "buckets o fun" on the porch.

      Anyway.. I just got home from Psychology class. We had a test in there today. I feel I did pretty well. I'll know something next week.  Recently I have noticed that I have started to change the way I speak. I seem to be getting a more northern accent everyday. I dont hang out with anyone with strong northern accents... so i dunno. Maybe its from listening to Sean Hannity too much. hehe  Either way, I should try and watch myself. Talk normal. I remember this one time at Longhorn Steakhouse I placed my order with the waiter and he asked where I was from. I said...Jacksonville.. and he was like oh.. you sound like you are from a foreign country like Ireland er England or something. He must have been smoking something. Isnt it funny how people may think you are nerdy because you always study during your lunch break or a free moment at work. But they come to you for things like "How do you spell Bangkok?" Or "What time zone is Michigan in?" Of course all this information is available to be found on the internet so you dont look like a dumbass. This dood came to me today with a college algebra problem that his mom was having trouble with. I havent taken that class in about a year and a half. It took some time to remember things but I came around. He still didnt beleive me when I gave him the answer. He ended up going to some internet site where you can type in the problem and it solves it for you. Guess what.. I was right. I was like.. "when are you going to start trusting me, bill?" He said..."right now." This isnt the first time he has asked me junk and second guessed what i said. Mr. College Degree over here. sheesh  Anyway, I need to go study.

      I am so sleepy and sick. I wish I could have stayed home today. Now I have the three day school stretch. I should call out Friday er something. Hell... maybe even tomorrow. I dont know.   The amazing race application just isnt going to get done before thursday. I dont have a passport or anything. I was planning on going to apply for one today, but I dont have the two photographs they need. So, oh well. Maybe next time.  This guy came to my door yesterday selling magazine for a trip to europe. He was actually pretty cute. So, of course I bought some magazines from him. Today I sent off a copy of the reciept to cancel it and placed a stop payment on the check. I sent the letter certified so I have proof. So much for his trip to europe. I kinda feel like a bastard, but I dont need 30 issues of Travel and Holiday magazine. So fuck em.  I should get to work. Today will be a long day. I hate Tuesdays. Oh.. YaY the Eagles won! (you know who you are)

Jenna would be leaving a newborn though so I dunno if thats the best thing. But.. it still would be cool.  I am so hungry. I am trying to really cut down on the amount of carbs I eat. Of course Mike wants pasta for dinner tonight. I will just make enough for him and have an egg and some cheese or something for myself. We'll see.  My dad is claiming that his computer still isnt working. I'm just going to take it away from him. He needs to be suspended er something. Maybe then he will learn how to treat the computer with respect.

      So... what did I do this weekend...? We went to the Oulet Mall in St Augustine. Then we went to Shoe Carnival. Mike got some new shoes. We had dinner at Longhorn Friday night and some Zaxbys chicken wings Saturday night. I finally got Mike to watch Good Will Hunting. He thought it was "okay". He said that it had too much talking.  Today, we watched the Jag game. They won! Before the game began we ran through the grocery store. Saw Mike's brother riding his bike. I spent almost $70 on just about nothing. Winn Dixie sucks. I could have saved $7 if I was a member of their stupid little club. Screw them. We only went there because it is the closest grocery store and the Jag game was starting in an hour....anyway....after the game I went to my parents house to get my dads computer working. He bought a new modem so I had to install that for him and try to get his Mcafee working. I got fed up with it and left there around 8pm. The new season of the SOPRANOS was going to be on at 9pm.. so I had to get out of there. Anyway.. its bed time. Time to get ready to start another week.

      i had a dream that i was in some department store. Feels like  urlLink Target . I was looking at remote controlled cars. I was wanting to buy one because last time I was in there it was only $30 but when the lady rang it up, it was like $150. I know this connects with my great deals I got at KMart last weekend. Most of the dream was spent trying to figure out how to get this remote controlled car for $30. i remember as i was speaking with the manager about it, my friend Miguel (whom I havent seen in real life in almost 2 years) shows up. But I am too consumed with this car that I tell him to hold on. I send Mike to get Miguels phone number but for some reason it never happens. I hate frustrating dreams like that.  My brain was picking out some crazy brain cells. Thats the biological view on dreams. Called the activation-synthesis hypothesis. It says that dreams are a by-product of random stimulation of brain cells and have no direct psychological meaning. People just like to think they do. That dreams are some porthole into the subconscious. Who knows.  Last night, Mike and I made margaritas and ate  urlLink Subway .  It took us almost an hour and a half to go to the liquor store and Subway. There is this little old japanese woman that works at our Subway at night. She is crazy slow and the line was out the door. But she is so cute you just cant get frustrated with her. She always slops too much of the toppings on your sandwich too. You have to order it like.. a little mustard..a little lettuce. I didn't though. I just let her slop it on. I don't mind the extra pickles.  :)  After subway we had to get ice for our margaritas. The dood in the gas station started chatting it up with me. Asking me how my day was.. who was that sitting in the car.  He said that I shouldn't have a boyfriend and that I need to be in school getting my grades. Then he chuckeled about how I prolly still remember school and blah blah blah. (it was only 6 years ago)  oi... 6 years ago.. thats a long time. :(  About my future. (I have a lot to say this morning, don't i?) I think I need to go talk to a counseler at  urlLink FCCJ . I need to know what options are available to me and what the best path is to take. I figured out yesterday that I am 4..well actually 6 classes including a foreign language away from getting my required classes out of the way for my AA. So thats 3 semesters. Less if I could go full time or take 3 a semester. Anyway.. then I have to just fill up my credits with whatever else I need to reach 60.  I have 38 right now. I will have 45 after this semester is over. oh dang.. and after finishing those 6 classes I need.. I'll be over 60 credits. huh.... there's my AA.  I didnt realize it was that close. hmmm. So I could transfer to a university.... this is going to require some more thought........

      It's time for the  urlLink Friday Five  once again!  1. What are your favorite ways to relax and unwind?  If I'm stressed, I like to go shopping. I also like to just plop on the couch, zone out and leave my world for a while.    2. What do you do the moment you get home from work/school/errands?   I throw all my junk that I have in my hands on the dining room table. Then go kiss my boyfriend.    3. What are your favorite aromatherapeutic smells?  mint and orange   4. Do you feel more relaxed with a group of friends or hanging out by yourself?  some people i hang out with can cause me to be on edge but others are awesome and i can just chill around them. I'm my favorite person to go shopping with though so I am pretty relaxed with myself too. :)   5. What is something that you feel is relaxing but most people don't?  Christmas shopping  :)

      Oh.. I mailed off that digital camera to Olympus yesterday. I hope they can fix it. And that its still free. Maybe if it only costs me $50 ill still pay to get it fixed. Then I would have spent $75 on that camera. But for a camera like that... its still a good deal. Then I can send boob pictures out to everyone!

      I got my Psy test grade tonight. Ya know, the one i thought I aced? I made a 72  :(      Ill have to study harder next time. But so far I have gotten 20 points extra credit. So actually I have a 92 on the test. But still... I need to do better.  I saw Julia at school today too. She is an old aol bud. We chatted it up for about 30 mins and then she had to go to class. She got my number before she left. I kinda dont want her to call me though. Im weird like that. Dunno what we would talk about over the phone. Anyway, she told me that FCCJ only offers the nursing program at night every 2 years. The next time it will be offered is 2004! Thats pretty crappy! How am I spozed to go to school during the day? Not too many places are open at night. Unless I work at Steak N Shake er something. Thats a frikken $10/h pay cut er so.   Maybe Ill just get my AA and go to UNF. But i think they just have day classes too. Maybe JU has night classes? Or maybe a school in south florida. Blah!

      i stayed home from work today. I feel so crappy. My body aches and my throat is sore and Im cramping which doesnt help. I couldnt go through another day at work feeling like this. So I slept in! I still have to go to class tonight. But I can do it.    So not too much to blog about this morning. I went 24hours without eating yesterday. I just wasnt hungry. So after school, I went to zaxbys and got some chicken wings. mmmm they were good.   Well, I'm going to go read my   urlLink Nealz News  and go curl up on the couch.

      What was I meant to do in life? I need to find my calling. It wasn't AOL. It's not ECCU. I'm just not happy with my choice of work environments. I was listening to  urlLink Bob & Sheri  this morning. They are at Disney World right now. Had some lady on their show who had her BA in Zoology. She gets to work at the Animal Kingdom training the animals and whatever else she does. I thought that might be neat. Until a goat rams you in the ass. Or you get your fingers broken by a birds beak. So, I dunno. I am currently attempting to get an A.S in Nursing. I can't apply for the program yet though. I have to take A&P II still. Maybe next fall I will be able to apply. But I hear its super hard to get into. Especially if your GPA isnt above 3.5. I'm not even sure if I'll like nursing. I think I do. I have always been interested in different types of diseases. I read the Mayo Clinic book many times when I was younger. blah.   So its Tuesday. I hate these days at work. My face is itchy. I have an appointment with a dermatologist on Oct 14th. Maybe he can fix this red splotch. I have had it for a while now. A few months I guess. Not sure what it is. I actually have 2 of them. One next to my nose and the other near my chin. I think its related to my dandruff. Which is getting worse everyday. Nothing helps anymore. I'm just a festering flaky sloughing pile of skin. ewwwwwwwwww

      I am so ready for this day to be over with. I really need to make an appt to go see Dr. Trotter. My head is killing me. It kills me everyday. Brings me down.   I have a lot of homework to get done tonight. I have been working on it all weekend. Its stupid the amount of homework that I have to do. If I worked part time, it would be so much easier. I would have so much more time. I wonder if thats thats possible...  I get paid on Wed. I have an itch to go shopping for clothes. If I worked part time I couldnt do things like that. I was thinking about going to TJ MAX after work to see if they had anything. But, I really need to go to homework.  I might be driving out to Ted's house tonight to give him a modem thats baking in my car. Still, thats just a might. Depends on the amount of homework I get done. I have a chemistry test tomorrow too that I need to study for.

      KMart has some great deals today. I got a Kodak Advantix T700 zoom that usually costs $180 for $17 and an Olympus D-360L digital camera that was $280 for $25. Sucky thing is, I got it home and it frikken doesnt work. Doesnt come on.  :(   I called all of the other KMarts in Jacksonville to see if they had one I could exchange it for. None of them did. It was a clearance item and at that price I can understand. I dont have any warrenty info or anything because it was the display model. Maybe I will call Olympus and see if there is anything they can do for me. I have 90 days to bring it back to KMart.  Sure would have been the deal of the century if it worked.

      Not too much to say recently. I took a PSY test tonight. I don't think I did well. We'll see.  I want another piercing. But I dont know where. I have my tongue, ear lobes and ear cartilage. I just got my right ear cartilage done a month ago. Its not healed all the way yet. It took my left one about 3 months. I don't want to get my nipples done. I can't do anything on my face because of my job. Can't do a belly button. I just dont have the stomach for that. So I guess I'm outta luck. I saw some chick at the  urlLink warped tour  with that place between your boobs pierced. That was odd. I wont be doing that any time soon. It's amazing how piercings are addictive. I guess I feel the same way about them as some people do about tattoos.   If you've never heard the 311 version of Sublime's "What I got".. you must download it. And thats all I have to say about that.  This weekend is the  urlLink Fall Home & Patio show . Frank from  urlLink Trading Spaces  will be there. So will I.  :)  Someday I will update this site. Add links and stuff. Make it more...me.  But right now its just easy to keep this template.

      Here is another Tuesday. Now I have 4 ATM bags to balance instead of 2. I used to have 0 about 4 weeks ago. They just cant get it straight. Losers.  If you were a manager..would you get onto your employee for printing out their work for the day before they clocked in? I dont think that printing my work is the same as doing my work. It only takes like 3 min then I screw around until 8..8:15. Gives me time to go get something to eat if I want to. Especially on Tuesdays when I leave early and have a crap load to do. Whatever. Write me up for trying to get ahead.   I have chemistry class tonight until about 8:30 or 9. Depends on how long lab takes. Its a lame models lab so it shouldn't take too long. I should also be finding out what grade I got on my test from last week. Lets hope its good.   Its time to clock in.......

This department is so backwards, unorganized and short handed. I am really unhappy. Not as unhappy as I was at AOL but still unhappy. I dont want to be unhappy anymore. If effects my work performance. I guess I'll go get back to being unhappy....

I have an umbrella but its not that big and its raining pretty bad. I hate driving around downtown in the rain too. :(    Maybe some other time this week. Or maybe it will stop in the next 10 minutes.

      ugh  i frikken hate cockroaches. they scare the crap out of me. i was going into the laundry room to throw away some left over tator tots - and something black moved in the garbage can. It caused me to drop 3 tator tots. I tossed the ones that I had left in my hand into the garbage can then grabbed the RAID. I sprayed it into the garbage can and came into the bedroom. I thought about taking the garbage out for a while... so I put on my sandals. Still not knowing how I was going to overcome this quick black thing that moved in the garbage can. So I opened the door to the laundry room and stood there for a moment... listening. I could hear something... but I couldnt place what or where it was. I then grabbed the phone to call my sister. I asked her why she couldnt live next door so she could take care of things like thjs for me. I kept her on the phone for support as I grabbed the broom. I planned on poking the garbage can to see if anything would come out. Instead I decide to sweep up the kitchen some.... turn around... and on the floor about 2 feet away is a huge ass cockroach. I scream and cry while my sister is telling me to calm down and that everything would be alright. This thing is like 2 inches long! Thank god he was on his back and dieing. But.. he was still RIGHT THERE. I cant go back in there. Not until he is totally dead. Mike is going to have to take the garbarge out too. I can't even pick those things up where they are dead. I have to sweep them out the front door. There is one still one the stairs that was in the bathroom. I swept one that was in the kitchen under the washing machine. I'll deal with him when we move. There is still one smooshed in the bedroom carpet from months ago. Gross huh? There was one that I watched die sitting right here the other night. I dont know where he went. Mike wont tell me if he picked him up er not. I still feel all uneasy and scared from dealing with that monster bug in the kitchen. All of these cockroaches showing up uninvited sure isnt helping my fear of them. One.. once in a while.. I can sort of handle. But.. this has been like at least one a day. At they come out of no where and startle me. Which just makes it worse. ugh. I need a hug.

      So Mr Ted thinks I can't name at least 5 Jaguars players. I was telling Mike about his mouth when he came home for dinner. So, Mike quizzed me. He asked for names and positions. I got 15 players and positions correct. How's that for being a chick.  :P  He started asking me the differences in the players too or what I could say about them. I did alright with that. So blah.. I'm not some chump Jaguars fan.  :P

      What a frikken cool ass day today has been!  For the past month, my managers have been saying that we have a huge ass project to do today. No one was allowed to take the day off. One chick had to come today who was on vacation. We had to work late last night and come in early today so we could get our crap done to do this "project". They even got our lunch orders last week since we would be unable to take a lunch. I was planning on getting a crispy chicken salad from the Loop. So, today I get here at 7am. I had a meeting from 8am-10am. Came back to my dept and got some more work done. At around 10:30 my manager Marlene comes out and tells us to log off our computers. She said we were part of a fire drill practice. They wanted to see how long it would take us to get out of the building. She said we would get into a school bus downstairs - go to the downtown branch - head to the 2nd floor where she would do a head count. So we all grab our junk and head out the door. 1st odd thing was that we were taking the elevators. She was pushing us for time and we all thought the stairs would be faster. Instead all of Automated Services AND Accounting got into one elevator. Sure enough, downstairs was a school bus. We got on the bus and headed towards the downtown branch. The guy driving the bus... missed the branch. He went right past it. We were all yelling about him missing it and made jokes about how we were going to the Avenues mall instead. I was expecting him to turn around and go back to the branch. Instead he went over the Main st bridge and we ended up in the Charthouse parking lot. Confused and excited - we all got off the bus. Awaiting us at the dock was the Lady St. Johns. We spent the afternoon cruising the St. Johns River enjoying a catered lunch and the wonderful weather. It was a wonderful surprise. It was a reconstruction celebration that we were spozed to have a long time ago but we all forgot about it. Our managers did a great job planning this. We all had no idea! When we came back to work, on our desks there was a rose on top of a gift and a card. The card was a personalized thank you from Marlene and the gift is a nice notebook that has T.E.A.M embossed on it and a picture of some doods taking on some rapids. Then Accounting started singing happy birthday to Gary and came over here with some birthday cake.   Its just been a cool day. Even though I didnt get my Loop chicken salad.

      Well, I went to the dermatologist this morning. The visit cost me $25. I have  urlLink Seborrheic Dermatitis . He wrote me 3 prescriptions to minimize the issue. But its something that will never go away. He also "froze" a wart that has shown up on my hand. Today was the first time I have used ECCU's health insurance. Man.. does it suck. It cost me $40 for this foam junk I have to rub in my scalp and $10 for some face lotion. I haven't filled the shampoo prescription yet.  But, whatever. Its still cheaper than if I didnt have any insurance.

      This weekend was kinda neat-o. Friday night we had dinner at a new resturant around here called  urlLink o'charleys . It was a big disappointment. We were expecting corned beef and Guinness but instead we got blackened steak and Amberbock. Mike's "blackened" steak was 1/4in thick, half fat and not spicy in the least. My steak and shrimp combo was alright. The veggies were undercooked. This place sure isn't like Outback.   Saturday morning we went to the stadium for the Jaguar sendoff tailgate party. It was put on by the Booster Club who provided free hotdogs and cokes. It was kinda lame cause everyone there was all old and cheesy. There was this poor old woman there who musta been at least 80 years old with a walker. We kept thinking she was going to die when she was crossing the parking lot. Hopefully more people will show up next time. It was cool seeing the players go to practice, come back, then leave in their SUVs all pimped out. Maybe hardcore football fans like Ted or season ticket holders like Jeanne and Jerry will consider supporting their team and the tailgate party will be just that. A par-tay. Its a good idea. Just more people need to do it.   Saturday afternoon we went to the IMax theatre at the World Golf Village and saw Destiny in Space. It was a stunning narrative featuring the vocal talents of Leonard Nimoy.  The IMax camera takes us on an adventure aboard the space shuttle to repair the Hubble Telescope and into the depths of space. We really enjoyed it.   Saturday evening we spent almost 4 hours looking for a big ass wine glass to drink cocktails out of. We tried Target...but they had nothing. So we tried Regency Mall next. Surely the mall would have what we were looking for. An old black woman working at Belk almost passed out when we told her what we wanted. At about 10 til 9 we headed over to Garden Ridge. Sure enough, they had the exact glassware we were looking for. Unfortunatly, we spent 25 mins in line waiting to check out. We had this crazy lady behind us who would not stop making comments about how long the wait was.  Finally, we were able to make our way to ABC liquors and buy more margarita mix. We both enjoyed big ass margaritas for the rest of the night.   Sunday was peaceful. I spent some time in the morning cleaning up the kitchen. Then I headed to Publix to do my shopping. The rest of the day.. well.. not much went on. I did some homework, watched the Jag game, took a bath, watched the Sopranos and wrote this blog.   Tomorrow I go to the dermatologist. I hope he can fix my skin. Soon.  I also have two tests this week and have to work all day Saturday. I wont be able to make the Jaguar send off. :(   Damn ECCU.   I'm sure I have some jacked up spelling in here. But give me a break.. I have no spell check.  :)

       urlLink Edvard Munch: The Scream   I have this painting in my bedroom. I always thought that it was popular. But just now, this chick I work with held up a check with this image on it and wondered aloud if this was a "younger generation" thing because she thought it was weird. One girl looked at it and said.. oh that guy is a freak. One chick new it was a painting but that was it. It was up to me.. once again... to inform my coworkers what it was. The chick who thought it was a younger generation thing said.. oh he must of been on LSD. So I informed her that LDS was not created until like 30 or 40 years ago. Exact date I dont remember. But come on people. Learn a little about the world. Get your face out of the bible.

      Time for another day in the socialist world of automated services. I picked the sour-puss attitude today. I'm sure I'll get my smiley face turned upside down.   Anyway, I think I have a UTI. So i drank a ton of cranberry juice last night. This morning it didnt hurt when I went but I still don't feel right.  I drank some apple juice and grapefruit juice this morning instead of a soda. I'm not sure it thats any better for me. I guess I'll know in about 30mins to an hour when its ready to come out.

      ugh I work with a bunch of liberals. One girl just said "once you get a certain age or if you are disabled you shouldn't have to pay for health care". So, I asked her... "Who's going to pay for it?" Guess what her answer was.... the government. I sure would like to know where she thinks our wonderful government gets all this money from. Oh but other countries have free health care. I'm sure some countries do. But what do they sacrifice for that free health care. She couldn't answer me.  This other lady here has a 16 year old daughter who she doesnt let drive on the expressway. I must agree with her on that. For one, I dont feel that 16 year old drivers are mature enough to drive at all. The driving age should be raised to 18 or at least 17. Its amazing what a year can do. Everyone in here was against that idea. I'm sure they will be singing another tune when a loved one is killed by a 16 year old driver.. on the expressway..who was too busy messing with the radio.

I plan on getting my eyebrows waxed at noon then going to see a house at 3. My friend Jenna is getting induced tomorrow. So sometime tomorrow I will be making my way to the hospital to see her and her new baby Angie.  Saturday at 9:30, I am going to look at another house. Then at 11am I have a meeting with my Psychology group at IHOP to discuss our game that we are making. After that.. around 2.. I am going to look at 4 more houses. I havent even looked at one house yet and Im already tired. hehe  Sunday I am still free. I think I will use that time to catch up on some homework and just relax. No stress.

      This friday is just going to be packed up. My car has begun to make a loud screechy metallic sound. I called Mazda and they said it was prolly my brakes and they could fix it on Tues or Thursday. Well, those are the days I have school. So I called Meineke. They are open on Saturdays 8-4 so thats an option but they would also be available on Friday. I am off of work this friday. So this is what I'm thinking.. get my car to meineke at 7:50am (before they open) so I am the 1st one there. Hopefully they will be done by 11am so I can make my salon appointment at 12pm. Sometime that day, Jenna is going to have her baby if she doesnt have it before then. I also wanted to get with a real estate agent and start looking at some houses. There are just not enough hours in a day.  So, hmmm.. whats the best way to go about this? Wait to get the brakes done on Friday? Are realtors around on Saturdays? I still have to work on my PSY project too....

      My mortgage papers should arrive today at work. They attempted to deliver them to me yesterday. But like most people, I work in the day time so no one was there to accept the package. So I had the package redirected to my place of work. I leave at 2 today so I hope it shows up before then. I will not be home after I leave here.. thats why I didnt just leave things the way they were. I am leaving today because I won 2 tickets to see  urlLink Sean Hannity  today at  urlLink Alltel Stadium . He will be broadcasting his radio show from 3-6pm and there will be a speech afterwards. I hope that I don't forget my camera. I am pretty excited about it. Sean Hannity rocks! Sean, Neal Boortz and Rush Limbaugh have truly opened my eyes to the world of politics. They just make sense.I grew up in a leftist household. My family has always felt that it was the governments duty to take care of them. Anyway.. I don't feel like getting into that.

My realtor just checked over my good faith estimate that I got from my mortgage company. He said it all looks good. So, today he is making the contract. Very exciting. The closing costs are a little more than I wanted them to be.. but what can ya do. I  hope it all works out.  :)

      I dont know if I like this whole tanning thing. Last night I didnt not get to sleep until after 3am due to my entire body itching like crazy. It was the worst feeling in the world. I would try so hard not to scratch..but it was uncontrollable. I took a nighttime sudefed, rubbed lotion and goop all over me, took a cool shower, took some aleve, and tried a shot of tequila. Nothing made it go away. Finally I fell asleep. Maybe I am allergic to the tanning lotion.

That would be reason enough for me to do my shopping at Publix from this point on." My reaction.. "word!"  I stopped shopping at those other grocery stores a few months ago. I shouldn't have to be a member of a special club to get special deals. Its just a way for them to gather marketing information on you. Feeding the beast. I'll pass, thank you. I can go to Publix and save more money with their Advantage Buys and junk.

      I mailed off my mortgage paperwork today. So now I get to sit around and wait some more.  My skin is really itchy due to my new addiction. .. okay okay so I started tanning. I have gone twice for 10 mins each and now I'm a lil burnt in areas that have never seen the light of day. Not a bad burn. But a burn none the less. So its itchy. Mostly my chest.  I'm spozed to go again tomorrow but not if I'm still pink.  We'll see how it goes.  I am going to get trained as a teller on Saturday at the Mandarin branch. Its going to be some nice extra cash. The branch is about 5 mins from my new house. Ill be spending many Saturdays there for a while I'm sure. Lets see.. I could use that extra money just to pay off my credit card. So how many Saturdays would I have to work? hmmmm... 4 saturdays a month.. thats only $250.. $3000 in a year... dang I'd have to work every saturday for 2 1/2 years er so. Well.. its going to take that long anyway. I also might be able to make a little extra cash at the tanning salon on the weekends. So maybe that will bump me up to an extra $300 a month or $3600 in a year.  Whatever... just send me money.

Was that a polling place? Was she too close to it to be handing out her opinion? I always thought you had to be at least 500 feet away from a polling place to campaign. Maybe the laws are different here, so I don't know for sure, but I will try to find out. The look on her face is one that's not sure of her actions. Just an opinion, Page 6 Nov. 9, check yourself and look at her expression. Things that make ya say hmmm!  I hope no one loses his livelihood over [state constitutional] Amendment 6.

      I called my Dad last night to find out what was up with my Mother. He said that he didn't know and didn't care. He wasn't going to call Flagler to find out. He talked more about getting a divorce and said how he hated to put this on us during the holidays. I asked him about Thanksgiving being cancelled. He said that it wasnt and he would take care of the cooking. I asked why it was cancelled anyway and he said because he wouldn't take my mom to the grocery store. So she got pissed. She has been drinking again. She knows it will kill her so obviously she doesn't care. My Dad is at the point now to where he doesn't care either. Some of his meds need to be refilled but he isnt going to bother. I am really not looking forward to this holiday season. Who knows if Mom will be home. If she is.. there will only be fighting. Christmas.. I'd rather just pass on it this year.

Well, yesterday my sister calls me to let me know that Mom has taken off. All the Thanksgiving decorations are missing and from what we understand Mom admitted herself to the psycho ward at Flagler Hospital. She left a note saying she was going to Flagler and not to call. She is such a baby. My sister said, the whole reason thanksgiving was cancelled is because Dad wouldn't take my mother to the grocery store to do the thanksgiving shopping. He felt it was too early. So, she threw a fit.   Whats next?

But, you have to admit.. it sure is fun fighting all those people for the best deals. And its good for the economy. So spend away! You people out there need to make up for the christmas money I won't be spending this year. I have thought about using my credit card. But, I wont. It just isnt worth it.  We have been listening to chrismas music this morning at the office. I am tired of it already. Its not Decemeber yet. I've been told its going to be playing everyday until Christmas. Thats just what they do. Please kill me now.

      I had a scare with my siamese fighting fish yesterday morning. I always feed him before I leave. I could see him down in the corner of the tank. I put his food in the tank and he didnt move. Strange, he usually is swimming around this time of morning. I tapped on the glass and he still didnt start moving. I was getting kind of nervous. I turned on the light to the living room as well as his tank and still no movement. I tapped for a little while longer. He would jerk.  I noticed his gills werent moving or his fins... eyes.. nothing. I accepted the fact that my fish was prolly dieing.  I was sad about it. Giving up, I tapped the glass on last time and he started swimming around. Ate his food and flared at me. YaY! He was okay! Throughout the day at work though I worried about him. But sure enough.. he is just fine. I guess he was sleeping.

We didnt feel like having hotdogs from the hotdog guy on the southbank. We had some awesome hamburgers and I had a few drinks. I ordered a rum and coke first. Drinking it, I realized how tired I was of the rum and coke flavor. So next I had a madras (i think thats how its spelled). It was not bad. The one I had on La Cruise was better. After that I had a cape cod. Which is cranberry juice and vodka. I enjoyed that while the fireworks were blasting away over the river. Didnt finish it though. I had enough. I still havent found my new drink of choice.

      Yeah I know it's been awhile since I have blogged. I have been very busy with moving and finals. I just found out what I made on my Chemistry final. A C.. giving me a C in the class. I'LL TAKE IT! I have my Psychology exam on Wed. Its going to be an easy grade. But even if I make a 100% on the final, I will still only get a B in the class. According to my grade calculations anyway. Maybe the teacher has some extra credit that I forgot that I turned in. Who knows. Either way, that class is passed. I am just soooo happy that I passed Chemistry I could explode. I would have a celebration drink but its all at the new house!   Tomorrow is moving day. We will be renting a U-Haul and my sister's guy friends are helping us move. I hope they don't back out when they find out I am on the 3rd floor! hehehehe  That was just one important fact that I forgot to mention i spoz. :)

      Lets see...   My mom stole another one of my sister's checks. We don't know how much it's for and she won't admit to it. My sister has placed a stop payment on it and plans on going to a branch to file a police report and all that junk.  When I talked to my Dad last night, he said that my mother had all her crap packed up. I wonder if she will be there for christmas...  I wonder if I will be there for Christmas. Because I really don't want to. I usually sleep over there on Christmas Eve and wake my sister up the next morning. We open gifts and later I head over to Mike's grandma's house. I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to return the gift I got my mother too. Its nice, and I dunno where she would put it in her new HUD home if she is really going on welfare.   Maybe I'll just treat Christmas like any other day off. Sleep in. Maybe unpack some. Mike says I can go to his grandma's. My friend Jenna says I can go to her house. I want to be with my family. Why do they have to be so screwed up. Ugh.

      I need someone out there to tell me what is wrong with my Siamese Fighting Fish. He is losing some scales on his head. This is the 2nd time. The 1st time it healed up after I added some more stress reliever to the tank. I'm not sure if thats what fixed the problem or if it was just a coincidence. His back fin is also starting to split. My guess is fin rot. I will be heading to the pet store as soon as i can to get some medicine for that. I don't want to lose my little beta. :(   He is my buddy.

      Well, my fish has stopped losing his scales. But he is now suffering from tail rot. poor thing. my mom gave me some fish meds that should of made it better. It just made the water purple and foamy. Its been about a week now since i added the meds and his fins seems to have stopped "rotting". I cleaned half his tank today. i read somewhere that you should only clean it half at a time. I used the filtered water from the fridge. I would have used bottled water if I had some. I hope this water is better for him than straight from the tap. He seems okay so far.

      Last night we went to a wine tasting. This girl I know from work, Amber, her in-laws just opened the wine bar up in mid december. This is the 2nd one I have gone to. I really enjoy them. Its fun to taste the different wines. Amber is really cool too. We have, as she says "bonded" well. Chad, her husband, and Mike seem to get along too.   Today was another full day. We went to the mall (again) and looked at lawn mowers. We walked out of the mall without buying anything, which is amazing. We also went to BJs and got some rib roast to make a prime rib tonight. It is cooking as I type. We are having the prime rib with some mashed potatoes, rolls, and a salad. It will be washed down with some wine we bought last night. :) Today we also went to Ace Hardware and got some plants. I got a rose bush and some bulbs to plant and Mike got himself an orange tree. We dont know where its going to live, but there is plenty of yard to pick from.   I am trying to plan a party. I feel that its time to have people over. I made a list of about 25 people. I dunno if I should invite them all or split it into groups. Mike said he isnt sure how we are going to entertain these 25 people. So... whatever. We'll figger something out.

      Yep, its another year. Do I have anything to say about 2002? Not at all. Did I learn anything? Yeah, prolly..  I sure did choose the grouch attitude this morning.  ::sigh::  *My mother should be moving out of my parents house this month.  *My fish seems to be doing alright. *I spent way too much money on window treatments yesterday. *My resolution is to get back down to the weight I was 5 years ago.  *I'm hungry.   On the radio this morning they asked if I was happy that the holidays were over or not. In a way, I'm happy to see them go. On the other hand, I would have liked to have spent them differently and kind of want a do-over.  Oh well... time to get to work.

I woke up this morning all sick and I don't feel like I can handle too much craziness today. I should prolly cancel the whole thing all together. But once I do, I'll prolly feel just fine. So.. I wont. Chad is looking forward to kicking our butts too much and I wouldnt want to disappoint him. :)

      more thoughts as i sit here trying to get myself to go to bed..   damn - i'm getting old. in the car today I said to Mike.. "you're going to be 26 right?" Only reason I confirmed was just incase there was a draft. He said.. "yep.. 18-25.. " and kinda did his arms in an "alright" motion.  I'm still kinda stuck on this 26 thing. That means I'll be 25. Veinticinco. Ok so all you 30+ yr olds out there are like.. shut up amber! But come on.. you were here once too.. and you had to of thought the same thing.. right?   My fish has been being a kook since I got home.. so I'm going to go check on him then head to bed. 5:30am comes early ya know.

      this whole Mike working two jobs thing.. its actually not so bad. when we moved it sucked for a while because at the apt he at least came home for dinner. but now, i have school 4 days a week at the south campus. either we meet up before work/school and hang out for an hour er so or I try to make it up there for his dinner break. tonight i got there about 8:30 and he was coming back from Arbys with his dinner. We sat in my car and chatted while he ate and then I went inside and hung out until 10pm. So.. we are still able to spend some time together.  In feb I will be working 3 saturdays. not full saturdays - just as a teller. feb 1st and 22nd I get to work the beach drive thru. I'm kinda excited about it. Ive never done drive thru before and I hear its a lot better than the teller line. maybe ill get to see some of my beach friends. ::hint - hint - nudge kick::  :)

Cause it just keeps making more. Its not like you can breathe after your done blowing it anyway. Its a waste of tissue or toliet paper - which ever one is closer. Instead, I like to just plug it up with the tissue. Keep it from dripping out. hehe ewww Its a shame tissues dont work as well with snot as they do with water. Shove it on up there and let it soak up that clog. ewww again

      never before have both of my eyes started twitching at the same time - its usually either one or the other - not anymore! hehe  I am still waiting to hear about getting an interview for the trainer position.  I'm going to try my hardest for that position. It's just a different type of interview when you still have a job, ya know?  I got my review today too. I am "showing improvement". And to my surprise I will be getting a bonus as well as a raise. I won't know the amounts until mid-march though.   I am working all Saturdays in March except one, too. $$$$  I think I have shin splints. My shins hurt when I walk and if I press on them, it feels like I should be pushing down on a bruise.

      Today is going by so slow. I have a ton of work to do but no motivation.   I made a 66 on my stat test. :(  I knew I screwed up. The math is so logical too. It all makes sense. I just have a hard time remembering what to use when. I just need more practice. I find out tonight how I did on my spanish test from 2 weeks ago. I also screwed that one up. I was sick as crap and had no business trying to take a test anyway. Tests in that class only count as 15% of the grade, so I'm really not worried about it. We are spozed to have a test tonight but the professor was out all last week. I really don't think he will bust a test out on us.  I need to get out of this department. Our managers suck and it's really starting to effect how we treat each other. This morning, I had a heated arguement with one of my co-workers. Never before have me and this person acted that way towards each other. It was awful. Of course it was over something stupid. She ended up apologizing and we worked things out. We are all just tired and strung out. Thats prolly why my eyes have been twitching for the past 2 weeks.

      I didn't get to work the drive thru on Saturday. Instead I got put on the front line. It wasn't bad, but still. This Saturday I am working at the Mandarin branch. Next Saturday I have off and the following I am back at the beach. This time I was promised the drive thru.  I got to leave work early yesterday. I had some comp time that I needed to use. I went and got my oil changed and tires rotated at Sears. Sears is a lot cheaper than Jiffy Lube AND I didn't have to deal with some guy telling me about my air filter and all the crap I am spozed to get done to my car every x thousand miles. After Sears I went to the tanning salon and did the stand up tanning bed. I'm a little pink this morning. I was only in there 10mins, but it is a lot stonger than the lay down beds.  I left the salon at about 7pm. I usually stay there and talk to Laurie for a bit. Retarded me forgot to get gas at BJs while I was there. So I will have to get some before Tae Bo tonight. I should also be finding out what I made on my statistics test.  oh boy.

      Things are still looking good for that training position. Its only me and some dood from another state that she is interested in. I have an inside connection in there whispering in her ear about how wonderful I am. :) I hope it works out.   For those of you out there concerned with when I am getting married - I got the wheels churning in Mike's head last night. He was almost asleep when I blurted out, "Are you planning on marrying me?" He said that he was and asked why I brought it up. So I told him that I felt it was time to move on to the next level basically. He wanted to know how long I had been thinking about this. I told him a few months (about the time when we bought the house) but it has always been something I have tossed around in my mind. So... maybe I can get him to look at rings this weekend. :)

Hey .. if the socialists and anti-American crowd can use the Internet to get millions of myrmidons out on their anti-American marches over the weekend ... why can't we use the Internet to make a REAL change in America?  It's very simple.? Nothing complicated.? We want restaurants and fast foot joints to rename their French fries.? Same potatoes. Same ingredients. Same grease.? Same carbs and calories.? Just change the menu.? From now on they are Freedom Fries, not French Fries.? Every time we load up on this junk food we can honor that which makes America great .. not that which demeans and dishonors America.? Which "F" word do you like the most?? "Freedom" or "French"?  Clip --- paste -- e-mail --- forward --- print --- do it however you can, but spread the word!? Let me know when restaurants in your neighborhood pick up the cause!  It's Freedom Fries, not French Fries!   OK Neal... I'm spreading the word..

       urlLink Join us at the Olustee Battle Festival on Feb 14 & 15, 2001...   Drove out to Lake City today to see the re-enactment. It was rained out. :(  So, we pretty much drove to Lake City to go to Wendy's.   Yesterday was a beautiful day. We went down to St. Augustine and went to the top of the lighthouse. Mike had never gone up there before. He was anxious about it. He made it up there just fine and the view was amazing.   Looking forward for the day off tomorrow. I plan on catching up on some PS2 time.

It's hard to keep my interest and the short articles are usually enough.    2. What is your favorite novel?  I dont really have a favorite. I liked "The Catcher in the Rye" and "To Kill a Mocking Bird". I wouldn't call them favorites though.    3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  I have always enjoyed the Shel Silverstein poems.    4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  All of the books I have never finished!   5. What are you currently reading?  A book about wine. Its based on the wine school that was done at the Windows of the World Resturant at the World Trade Center.

      Another weekend coming to a close. Didn't really do much of anything. Got some tea from  urlLink Teavana  on Saturday. Worked out at the beach branch that morning. Had a really bad rain storm. Oh and we went shopping for some new slacks for Mike. Everything was overpriced.  Today I picked up the house some.  The Suttons came to visit. It was nice to have some company over. After they left, I went to Lowes to look at paint and bought some rugs. The rugs aren't the greatest.. but for the price I couldnt say no.

      "People are strange, when you're a stranger. Faces looks ugly when you're alone."  For some reason I have that song in my head. I haven't heard it in years.  I am waiting for Mike to call. He said he would call before he left BAM so I could get his dinner ready. Getting his dinner ready was actually my idea. I didn't want him wasting money at Wendys again after I bought all this food. Its 11:15pm and he still hasn't called. I guess they aren't letting him leave early.   Just talking to his mother... she mentioned how she saw a streaker running down Monument road at about 8pm this evening. Anyone hear anything about that?   I didn't go to the tanning salon like I usually do on Wednesdays and Fridays. Instead, I hung out with my friend Jenna and her children.  She is getting ready to audition for the Jacksonville Jaguars cheerleaders. THE ROAR!  :) I hope she makes it.  Well, Mike just called. He will be another 20mins before they get out of there. So, I told him I can't wait that long and he has to make his own hotdog. A girl needs her beauty sleep ya know.

I am so jealous! hehe  Over the weekend I looked at some rings on Kay Jewelers web site. I found a nice 1/4ct princess cut ring that I liked. So, I pointed it out to Mike and told him to buy it for me. He just shook his head and laughed while walking out of the room. Well, at least he knows what I want. ;)

      Another day, another quarter.  Ya know, I spent $160 bucks at Publix tonight. We had NO FOOD!  I bought a wine rack yesterday at Havertys. Its looks pretty nice. I am one piece of furniture closer to having a completed looking house. Next is my salt water aquarium.  :)  My friend Matt came over tonight to see the house. He hasnt been here since the day I closed. He liked our wall in the living room. Most people seem to like it. Which is nice. It makes a very bold statement I think.

Anyway, I didnt get the training position. They hired some girl from the outside because she had been a teller sup for 7 years. If they knew they wanted someone with a lot of teller exp they should have not jerked me around like they did. I am not happy.  Its busy now... 11:10am... time to get back to work.

      My heart doesnt seem to be getting any better. I thought that maybe it was acting up due to anxiety and stress of that training position. Its been a week since I was denied and my heart is still acting up. I have cut caffeine out of my diet for a week now. That doesnt seem to be the cause either. So.. I dunno. My heart "fluttered" twice early this morning while I was trying to sleep. Once at 12:57am and the other at 1:37am. Who knows how often it does it while I am actually asleep. Its strange, cause when I wake up I actually feel fine. But in about 10mins of being awake it starts to ache again. I am too young for heart issues.   My house is starting to reek from the shrimp I have put in my aquarium. I dont know how long I can stand it. Maybe since it looks like bacteria is starting to cycle, I can take them out. The shrimp were those dark colored ones and now they are pink with this white "haze" on them. Its pretty funky.   I was watching FOX news for the time that I was not asleep yesterday evening. I got tired of the war news after a while and tried switching the channel to Married by America. Woudnt you know FOX news was playing on that channel too! I couldnt get away from it. I dunno if it was the sat messing up or what. So, I just went back to sleep. I have been sleeping a lot this week. What a way to spend SPRING BREAK!

      I went to the doctor on monday for my heart. For the past month now, I have been getting these heart palpatation things. He did an EKG and that came out fine. He said there are many possibilities as to what is causing this. He wants me to keep a log of when it happens and what I am doing when it does for the next 2 months. After that, if it continues, he will put me on a heart monitor for 24 hours or so to hopefully catch it in action. So, we'll see how that all goes.   I put some damselfish in my aquarium on saturday since I had my salt levels correct. They are the hardiest fish and help start the nitrogen cycle. They were all dead by sunday afternoon. I got some sorry fish. My friend Scott says to just put some shrimp in there from the grocery store and let them rot. It does just as good of a job and I'm not wasting $25 every few days restocking the tank. I dont make that kind of money anyway! I plan on going to Publix today to buy some shrimp.   I think today is the last day Saddam has before he needs to leaves Iraq. He already said that he isnt going anywhere. I've heard many different comments on the subject. Two that I like are "Saddam will be dead in 5 days. Either by someone on the inside, his own hand, or the United States." and another talking about how we should start the war about 15mins before the Academy Awards begin. That way the news channels will be busy covering the war, instead of the Saddam supporters. I wonder if those libreal jerks will "apologize" once we uncover all of Saddam's WOM. For some reason, I find that doubtful.

      I know I haven't written in a while. Not too much going on I guess. My heart still acts funny. I log it like my doctor as asked. I haven't had any caffeine since I have been to the doctor. Sticking with Sprite or caffeine free Coke.  We have a wedding to go to this evening at the Prime Osborne Convention Center. Its going to be nice. The guest list is about 500 people. I'll be lucky if I get to say my "congrats" to the bride and groom.  There is also a "Support Our Troops" rally downtown this afternoon that we want to go to. I'm not sure if we are going though. We would have to drive downtown, drive back here to get ready for the wedding, then drive back downtown again.  I didnt go to Spanish class yesterday. We were going to learn a latin dance. Honestly, I wasn't feeling it. So I went home and got to spend time with Mike instead.  :) So, this war is getting kinda yucky. The Iraqi "leaders" are a bunch of evil jerkoffs and I can't wait until we get them. Peace will be here soon.

      Today has just been whacked out.   This morning, I had to deal with a dead fish and a dying fish. The poor dying fish was stuck in the filtration system. I had to turn the junk off and scoop him out. Then he fell on the floor. I'm sure that didnt help his situation. So I looked at him some while he was in my hand. He was moving a little bit. But not thrashing around like you would expect. So, I put him back in the water and he didnt do much. Just floated all sideways down to the bottom and waved his fins some. Poor little guy. :(  So then I leave for work. (I'll get this fish out when I get home tonight) I'm driving up Lee Rd and I see this dove in the middle of the road just sitting there. I'm starting to wonder if this damn bird is going to move. There is a car coming in the other lane so its going to be tough to get around it. The bird got up when I was about 4 feet away. She had a bunch of little birds follow her out of the street. But, left in the street was a little bird that I guess she had been sitting on. I guess she was trying to bring it back to life. I don't know. As I passed she went back out to the street with her little peepers and sat down again. It just broke my heart. :(  Work wasnt much better. I took 30 phone calls today. I havent had 30 phone calls in about 4 months! I average about 15 a day. I only got a lot of calls because one girl was off the phone training. The ATMS were going nuts today. I had to place service calls like crazy. Tons of ATM research coming in. But now its 5:30 and I'm done with it all. I'm so good I scare myself.   I don't know what to do with my evening. Its going to be light outside until about 7:30pm now I think. I do have some laundry to finish up. I want to go shopping but I really cant. Need to save money for that water softener we are getting.   What do you think about this? I plan on calling out from work this monday and tuesday just to show my manager that the girl she thinks is so wonderful and smart and can do my job....really can't. Maybe I'm just bitter. She has been here since like October and now she is being training all over the department like she is going to be our new "work leader". Uhm.. yeah thanks for just skipping over me. Oh wait.. I dont kiss your ass.. I forget that sometimes. That always holds me back. It kept me from being a coach at AOL and its keeping me from progressing here. Maybe I should... nah... I just can't bring myself to do it. I need to be my own boss.

I didnt do any this weekend because I knew I wouldnt be going to work today. Tonight at 7 I have to go study for my stat test. But other than that I have nothing else to do. I think I might go tan. Mike left his shoes on the counter so I might bring those to him. I need to go to Target and buy some panties for this panty exchange thing that Jenna sent me. I have $10 to last me until my next paycheck, so.. those panties might have to wait again. Why no money you ask? Because school costs a lot. I'm really thinking about getting student loans. Blah.

      My sister is moving to Orlando in August. She is hoping to get accepted into UCF. She has already sent off for her housing. She plans on staying at the off campus apartments. If she doesnt get accepted she will go to a community college down there until she can get into UCF. I'm proud of her and I hope it all works out. I'm going to miss her though. I see many trips to Orlando in my future. Too bad I dont have season tickets to Disney anymore.

      I registered for fall classes today. My last semester before my AA! That bitch is going to cost me at least $566 without books. And it had a little note saying that tuition prices are expected to go up so Ill have to pay the difference. This summer is already costing me $460.So if anyone out there would like to contribute to the "Help Amber Pay for College Fund" just send me a check! I did my budget today and I have a whole $26 dollars to last me every two weeks. Nice huh? I'm just trying to get my eye on the prize. That nursing degree.

      I can't wait for this week to be over and done with. I have to work Saturday and I just want to hurry up and start my weekend. The draft is Saturday and I wanted to go to the stadium to watch it. I should be home a little after 12 so I hope I don't miss the Jags 1st round pick. I think we are #8 so I prolly will miss out.   Jenna came over last night and we watched Insomnia. It was okay. I thought that it would have been a little more intense than what it was. It was just a simple little murder mystery.   I don't know what I am going to do tonight. I don't have class anymore on Tuesdays and Thursdays until May 5th. I might go to a softball game but I am kinda tired and I dont feel like chilling at the beach for 2 hours waiting for it to start.

      My 6 Damsels are still kicking. It's been a lil over a week now. One of them keeps getting picked on so I dont know how much longer he has. We checked out the Nitrite levels and they are still increasing. I think in a few more weeks we should be set. We went to Atlantis Aquariums this weekend. That place is frikken awesome! We just bought a background. They wanted too much for the rocks so we went out to the North Jetties to look for some. Didnt find any, but brought home some hermit crabs for the tank. They seem to be doing good too. Nothing like free hermit crabs! :) Yesterday, we spent Easter with Jenna and her family. We swam in the pool and had dinner over there. The dinner was very yummy. She made this Sweet Potato delight that was amazing. I'm going to have to get the recipie for that! My parents seem to be pushing a wedding. My mom tells me that my dad has offered to pay for the music, location and food. I need to talk to him about that. My mom might have made that up, ya know?

      I just got home from my very first BUNCO experience. It was quite fun! :) I am going again next month. All of the girls there were very nice. I was the oddball because I wasn't married nor did I have any children. So they got to talking about childbirth and crap while I just chilled in the back. I didnt win any of the prizes tonight. It seems that they way it works is that if you have an awesome night or a crappy night you win something. But if you just do okay than you leave empty handed. Cool thing is that I really didnt leave empty handed. This chick gets medicine samples sent to her house because a doctor used to live there so she brought those to share. Little trial sizes of childrens advil, robitussen and dimitapp. I know those are prolly spelled wrong. Im going to give the kid meds to my friend Rachel at work and keep the adult ones for myself. Also, the medicine lady brought back some special cadberry creme eggs from new zeland. They are flavors that are not here in the states. I got a Cadberry Dream Egg and a peppermint one. I havent tried either because I am waiting on Mike to get home. I think he went to the baseball game tonight. Jenna tried the dream egg and said it was yummy.   Mike needs to get his butt home. He has a meeting in the morning and I need to go out to Jenna's in the morning to go to a community yard sale at The Woods. Its spozed to be the best yard sale thing in jacksonville. I wont be buying anything. I'm just going to support Jenna and her purchases. :)  After shopping, I am going to try out my snorkeling gear than head off to see the XMEN.  Going to be busy busy tomorrow! I'll be lucky if I see Mike at all.  I know he doesnt want to go to The Woods but I'm not sure if he is going to come swimming. Thats why he needs to get his butt home so I can talk to him about this crap.

They said other than that cavity, I was doing a great job taking care of my gums and teeth and that I was one of her 'A' patients. I think I deserve a discount.   I also made my dentist's day. She is a member at the credit union I work at. We got to talking about how the ATM machine she uses is always down and how far she has to drive to get there. I let her know about the CU24 network which allows her to make withdrawals and deposits at any credit union ATM.  She was very excited about it and said that I just put a smile on her face. She couldnt wait to get home to tell her husband. I told her to write a letter but I doubt she will.

      I get to leave work early today to go to the dentist. Trust me, I'd rather be at the dentist. I got written up yesterday. :(  I took a non-negotiable check by accident while working an ATM bag. It was for about $320. They keep telling me not to make a big deal out of it. But to me, being written up is a big deal. And let me tell you this....this kiss ass in here.. lost $500 worth of checks....she hasnt been written up.   ugh   Anyway, I am looking forward to XMen this weekend. I'm going to make Mike take me whether he wants to or not. I have my first Bunco game tomorrow. And tomorrow we get our water softener. Wooo Hoo!  Other than that... not too much going on. Just watching my credit card balance increase with frikken school.. I am really thinking about getting student loans. I think those will be better to have than credit card debt. But... I guess a debt is a debt.   I hate being poor.

      I left work early yesterday to head to Jenna's to get my hair done. I call her from Sally's Beauty Supply and she tells me that Angie (the baby)fell of the bed. So, I get to her house and that kid is screaming! It has to be the worst scream I have ever heard. It was awful. Jenna called the doctor and she advised that we take the baby to the emergency room to make sure everything was okay. Luckily enough, everything was okay. We only had an hour wait which wasnt so bad either. Jenna ended up starting my hair around 9:30pm and I got home at about midnight. My hair looks good though. I got some compliments on it today. :)  I have my spanish exam tomorrow and next weeks starts summer term. Nice break huh? ...bunch jerks....  So, who wants to go out for margaritas tonight?

      Yesterday I worked at the Mandarin branch. It was busy all morning. I had wanted to get out early because we had planned on going to the Jaguars Draft fan fest thing that was going on that the stadium. Of course, when you are in a hurry... you are out of balance. I didnt get out of there until 12:45pm. I hurried up and got home and started changing my clothes before I had the front door shut. Then Mike tells me that its okay and we were waiting on Cory anyway. Whew. So, we went to the stadium. Lots of interesting renovations going on. Its going to be neat when its al finished. We got to tour the Jags locker room which was kinda neat.   After that we came home and I took a nap.  While I snoozed, Mike grilled some steaks, tomotoes and zuchini. Its was a very yummy dinner.   After dinner, we headed to El Apache resturant to meet up with a work get together for Mexican food and karaoke, The margaritas were gross. We had a few tacos that were okay. El Potro and La Napalara are a lot better than this place.   So, since Mike has made dinner these past two nights, I made him some pancakes this morning. I think he was pretty happy about that. I was pretty happy because I didnt have to hear about how much he wanted pancakes again. It made for a peaceful morning. :)  Today we are going to go looking for some snorkeling gear. Jenna and I are going to get scuba certified this summer. All I need to provide is the basic snorkeling gear and the cash to get certified. I've been saving for a while and I think I almost have a enough. After we go shopping, we might get a shrimp for the aquarium and maybe some live rock. But thats still up in the air. I think that if we got the live rock, its going to kill the damsels. But I guess thats okay, because I wasnt planning on keeping them anyway. I guess we'll have to wait and see when happens.

      We went to  urlLink River City Brewing Company, Jacksonville FL  last night to see my friend Jamey's soon to be wife sing. It was part of the  urlLink 'Gimme The Mike!'  contest one of our local news stations is putting on. Tracy was amazing! She had to of been one if not the best up there. A few of them were awful. Either too sharp or too flat. But it was still a nice evening.   Because we had gone to River City last night, I missed out on having any dinner. So I have like 20 points to eat today before 6pm. I guess that means I can eat at McDonalds er something. I weighed myself this morning and I have lost about 6lbs since Tuesday! I've heard that you only lose a huge amount during the 1st week. Then it slows down to a pound or 2 per week. But hey.. 6lbs is a great start!  I will know my offical number on Tuesday.

I knew I should of stopped at 7 shots.   Never got to see XMen over the weekend.  :(    Did some gardening and my hamstrings are killing me. Ive been streching all day and it hasnt helped.  I started my anatomy II class today. Its going to be tough. But I gotta do it to be a nurse. Anyone have any pointers?

      Today has been very busy. I was up at 7am to get ready to have a community yard sale. Jenna came over and we kept that going until about 11:30. It was too hot out there to stay. I made $14. So, I took that $14 and bought Larrys Giant Subs. :)   After Larrys, we went downtown to see the tall ships. Ended up taking a river taxi tour that took us to Ft. Caroline and back. It ended up being 4 hours. But, it was still cool.   Tonight, we are going with my dad to the Comedy Zone to see one of his friends. Should be fun. I need to watch what I eat/drink though.

      Ya know, I just have a real problem with plastic surgery. I guess in cases of facial reconstruction and stuff.. thats understandable. But because you think your lips are too thin or something lame like that.. I just don't agree with it. People getting bones removed from their waist to look like Barbie.. its just stupid. Its messing with the gene pool. "Ugly" people - making themselves "pretty" - reproduce and have children that looked just like how they looked before surgery! Whereas if they were too "ugly" to reproduce, more "ugly" people wouldn't be born into this world.   Anyway, I just think its lame.

      Wooo hoooo! Ruben won!!  Today I am going to have drinks with my friend  urlLink Jeanne  after work. Should be fun to chat it up for a few. Mike is jealous because he can't go. I'm sure he really wont feel like going since his ear is hurting him so bad. He woke me up last night to tell me how bad it hurt. Then later in the evening, I had to get up to use the restroom and when I got back in bed, I noticed how bad he was tossing and turning. He must be in a lot of pain. He needs to go to the frikken doctor.   My friend Jenna is stressing over the "stay-at-home mom" life. I can see how it could be frustrating. She really needs a break. I don't think that one bunco night a month or a few hours on Wed for dance is enough. Its like she has a full time job and works crazy overtime. Its enough to burn someone out. She needs to work something out like her and her husband have a little "getaway" weekend somewhere. Nothing fancy, maybe even just a hotel at the beach. It can be done. Then if not her and her husband, then just her. We all need a little time to ourselves. So, whatever... Jenna...take a weekend off!

      Can you believe this guy brought in a homemade german chocolate cake with all of us dieters in here. I could just smack him. It looks so wonderful. Ugh! Its not worth the 12 points. Right?   My friend brought me the coral that I asked her to buy for me when they went down to the Keys today. It is so awesome! I can't wait to put it in my aquarium. Our plan is to get a new light, sell the damsels back, do a water change, get some live rock, then buy some cool fish. Like a clownfish and a shrimp. And maybe a blue tang. We'll see. Its all $$$$$.  My mom is coming back today. My sister as asked if she can stay with me if she needs to. Like I have said, my dad has a girlfriend. Who is half is age. Anyway, when he went to Michigan everything was wonderful and blah blah blah. He is going to tell my mom to get a job and he is also going to tell her about Kelly. So, the shit is going to hit the fan. I told my sister that I wont be answering the phone anymore when it is from my parents house because I dont want it to be my mother asking if she can live with me. Because she cant.   Ugh.

      I am working at Mandarin right now. We were busy for about the first 30 mins and now its dead. I'm sure it will pick up again. I went to the Dr. yesterday about my dizziness. He said that it was vertigo and wrote me a perscription for the same meds that my dad already gave me. They make me so tired, I really dont like them. But I dont like being dizzy either. I am also really grouchy today. I think its a mix of being overworked and PMS. I just want to chill today.Maybe go swimming. I guess that all depends on what Mike wants to do. He may already have "plans". Finding Nemo came out yesterday and I want to go see it. I dont have any money to go see it yet. So maybe next weekend.

When I lay down or lean my head back the room spins. It sucks. I have a doctors appt on Friday.   My frikken manager said we were going to have pizza for lunch today. Well, its my lunch time and there is no pizza. I am so hungry! She said that there is a "payroll crisis" and isnt sure when she can go pick the pizza up. Well, why doesnt she just pick up the damn phone and order some. I'll go pick it up! Or have it delivered! Jesus! I am so hungry that I am going to be sick! I have no money for food here either.

Next Saturday Mike and I are looking at going to MedievalTimes in Orlando. The weekend after that we have a Wedding to go to . I did have my scuba class scheduled but I changed it so we could go to the wedding since Mike RVSPd for 2. And the weekend after THAT we are going to Virginia for ANOTHER wedding. Whew...I need a vacation! So far I have two weekends booked in July. I was wanting to have a party here shortly too. Maybe I'll do it in July. We'll see.

Everytime I asked him if he wanted to see the movie he would just make a yuck face and say things like yeah right or I dont think so. So, whatever. Maybe he will want to go this weekend.   I weigh in today in about 10mins. I hope I still lost. I should have. I will update when I get back. :)

I studied so much for it too. I asked this girl next to me who made a 95 how she studied. I'm going to try some of her tricks this time around. I would really like a B in that class since its 4 credits. A C is like getting a D in a 3 hour course. SUCKS for the GPA. I need all the points I can get so I will get accepted ASAP into the Nursing program.  And why are my feet peeling. I need a pedicure.

But hey, I'll take 1.4lbs!! If I keep up this average, I should be 20lbs lighter in 4 or 5 more weeks! Woo! And in the 16 week program.. thats 32lbs. Damn. I shouldn't get my hopes up..but damn.

How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  Its pretty much stayed the same. Always parted in the middle. Layers...no layers. Blue hair once, green hair another time, red streaks another. I tried the 80s hair look, but I could never get it to stay.    3. How do your normally wear your hair?  Parted in the middle and down.   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?  Longer with blue, green and white extenstions.   5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  Only the time the chick at hair cutter asked me if I wanted bangs.. and me not knowing what she meant said yes... and bam my all one length hair was no more.

I am cross training this week and next in the ACH postion. Its pretty neat.   Cried at work today in the diversity meeting. Well, everyone was crying. It was really...blah. We have to talk about life milestones. So its all emotional.   We have a wedding to go to on Saturday and a birthday party later that night. Next Thursday after work we leave for Va. Wooooo!  Anyway, I have lost a total of 11.8lbs. I've slowed down some. It needs to pick back up. My manager made the comment yesterday about how I was "showing". I just about crapped my pants. Once she realized how it sounded she corrected herself saying she meant my weight loss. What a goof.

      Had a busy weekend. The wedding we went to out in Callahan was one of the sweetest I have ever been to. It had lots of laughs and lots of tears. Very emotional.   Afterwards we had a bday party to go to. I did awful when it came to points. I just couldnt resist the ultimate mudslide! But, thats okay. If I gain tomorrow, than I know why and will try super hard to lose what I gained plus extra to make up for it!   We are thinking about having a party on July 19th. Would any of you regular readers have an issue of not being able to attend? I can always do it in August so its like a BDay party. But Jenna's bday is in August too and her house is cooler.

      Noah and I went out for drinks last night. It was really nice. He told a bunch of stories of what has been going on in his life. We talked some about the past. He brought back a lot of memories that I had forgotten. It was really really cool. He is still as beautiful as he was back then. He found it funny that I had a curfew. I told Mike that I was going out with Noah and he said how he was a little uncomfortable with it since Noah just kinda popped up. Mike would of rathered me bring along with someone else. But he said that I was grown and can do what I want. So, to make him feel better I told him a time that I would be home. 12am. That was only about an hour and 30 mins to go off and hang out. But anyway, I was good. So the night was over and he said he would give me a call. I told him the next time we hang out will have to be with Mike if he doesnt want me to have a curfew anymore.  He said that was cool - gave me a hug and left. ::sigh:: It was great. He is just part of my past that I thought I had lost forever.   Yesterday, I had a facial. It was awesome. I feel a ton better. Then afterwards I got some red, white and blue extensions put in. One set for each side of my head. I think they are cool. Mike thinks they are silly. But who cares. I like em! I cant wait for works reaction on Monday.

      We just got into town about an hour ago. Drove the entire way home from Va. Took about 12 hours I guess. I was glad we did it in one shot. I just wanted to be home.   The trip was okay. We walked around DC Friday when we got up there and Saturday before the wedding. On Saturday we went to the museum of American History and went to the top of the Washington Monument. I think the best part of the museum was the section on Sept 11th. It really brought you back to when it all happened.   Saturday night we had that wedding to go to. All I can say is...I've been to better.   My fish are still alive. So the chick I had come watch the house did a good job. :) The aquarium looks like shit due to some algae growth. The power had to go out for like 8 hours on Friday so that has screwed everything up.  Today is Mike's birthday. I forgot to tell him Happy Birthday when we got up this morning. Actually, I still havent said it. I gave him a birthday piece of gum. Thats about it. I know its bad. But I've just been stressed and preoccupied with many other things this past week. And being out of my element didnt help me either. Eh... It happens. I'm sure he doesnt really even care. He has done this same type of thing on my birthdays before so.... we are even.

      I lost another 1.4lbs today for a grand total of 14.8lbs. So close to 15lbs!!! I should reach it next week. :) Especially after this weekend of scuba training.   Not too much going on. I got my paper work to get into the Nursing program. I need to get my CPR certification again and take the NAT test. Then I should be able to apply. Next September they will be offering night and weekend classes. So maybe for the 9 months after I get my AA degree, I'll work a 2nd job to save up for school. Hopefully I get accepted!! Thats the other thing! I hear they are real picky and its hard to get into. So wish me luck. Oh.. anyone want to get CPR ceritified with me? I need to do infant, child and adult. Usually an 8 hour class. Mike did it with me a few years ago...but he wont want to do it again.

      Today was my second day learning to Scuba Dive. I am beat. Ive lost like 3lbs since Friday. Swimming around in a pool for 4 1/2 hours will do that to ya. At the end of the month Jenna and I will finish our certification. I hope our instructors are as cool as the dood we had this weekend. He helped me out a lot. I always seem to be the person that has all the issues and cant do it right. But he helped me through it. I could have given up - but I stuck with it. Now I just have to get through our 4 open water dives. I'm sure after this is all done I wont have any more issues and will want to go diving in the ocean and stuff. I want to actually get to see something. Our 4 dives are going to be at 2 different springs. We were told that at one of them there was really nothing to see. But the other has some freshwater fish and turtles....and don't forget.... alligators. Bleh.   I am waiting on Mike to get home with some pizza. Dominos just called and said they delivered our pizzas to another address and those people took them. I guess they paid for them. That doesnt make any sense. We told them we wanted to pick them up anyway. So, I guess they are making our pizzas again and Mike is standing there waiting. I hate Dominos. This is why I always go to Papa Johns. But with this diet I am on, I get eat more pizza from Dominos or Pizza Hut than I could Papa Johns. The only reason we didnt use Pizza Hut is because Dominos was $1 cheaper AND we got Dominos Dots with it.   I think when I weigh in on Tuesday.. I will have lost my 1st 10% goal.  :)  Then its 10 more % to go!

      I passed my Anatomy class! Thank goodness. I was nervous about it. Now I just have to focus on passing Spanish. 1 more semester and I will have my AA. I dont know how I am going to plan a wedding next semester. But thats what friends are for! :) I've been busy already trying to find out everything I can about putting on a wedding. Its a lot of work, and not having any money is making it even more work. I am full of ideas on how to save money though. I found a place to rent out for 17$ per hour. I am going to check it out on Monday since I am off work. I might go check out some consignment shops and stuff too.  This weekend is my SCUBA certification finalization. We will be doing 4 dives over the weekend. I am excited about it. Mike and I have planned a cruise for my birthday to the Bahamas. Jenna and Kenny are spozed to be going with us. After this weekend, the 3 of us (Jenna, Kenny and me) will all be certified so we want to go on a dive. I was looking at pictures of Bahamas diving at Books a Million tonight. It looks frikken awesome. I am really looking forward to it. So, lots of planning and looking forward to things coming up these next 8 months. Keep March 6th open on your calendars! Thats the date...so far...  :)

      I finished my SCUBA PADI certification today. I gave up on it yesterday after the 1st dive. I was way to freaked out to continue. But the dive instructor talked me back into the water. I got through the 2nd dive and dives 3 and 4 were a piece of cake. I am so glad now that I didnt totally give up. Now I can SCUBA in the Bahamas! YaY!

      Not too much has been going on. We have a place for the ceremony now. Its going to be at United Methodist at the beach. Its going to cost a little bit more than I wanted to spend, but Mike really wanted to get married there. Its where his parents were married. I need to find someone who will play the organ for me. Their organist is going to cost $150. I am thinking about calling my violin teacher and see if her and some students will do it. But if she wont.. anyone know any organists that owe them a favor? :)

      My wedding dress came in today! It still awesome and I still love it! The lady says that I shouldn't lose any weight cause then it wont fit right. I think that I will be okay. Shoot, I know that I can gain weight quickly if I need to. ;)  Went to a Body Shop party tonight with Jenna. Told myself that I wasn't going to by anything. haha yeah right. I got a few things. Since I'm 25 now, I need all the help staying young that I can get!

      we just got back from vacation 2003. Our aquarium is messed up. a hose came loose and water sprayed out for who knows how long all over the floor and now the pumps dont work. i guess they burnt out. so first thing tomorrow we have to buy new pumps. there was a big ass spider near the front door and i have dead roaches all over the place. eh.. at least they are dead. lots of cleaning to do tomorrow too!  So, my birthday came and went. I am 25 now. Yippie. Found out today that my grandfather passed that day. So, now my birthday sucks. Anyway, our vacation was pretty cool. We took a cruise to the bahamas with jenna and kenny. the 3 of us went scuba diving on the 23rd and saw 3 wrecks and a million sharks. it was really fun. after the bahamas, mike and i went to the keys. hung out in key west monday night and went scuba diving on tuesday in looe key. only saw 1 shark this time but a million barracuda. that night we drive up through alligator alley to punta gorda and spent the night there. That brings us to today and we went to Busch Gardens. did a few things there. I rode KUMBA by myself. Mike wasnt feeling it. It was a lot of fun. After that we drove to orlando to see my sister. we were spozed to spend the night there and go to sea world in the morning but we were just ready to come home. tired of living out of a suit case.

      I took my NAT test yesterday. I feel that I did well. I should know in about a month.  Mike got his car back this afternoon! WOOOOOOO HOOOOO! Now I don't have to bring him to work anymore or sit at Jenna's or BAM until midnight waiting for him to get off of work.  School started up again. I'll have my 1st degree after this semester is over. Then I will take the spring off to get married and start back up in the summer.  I fell asleep when I got home this afternoon. Mike was on the computer and it was raining and the tv wasnt getting a signal. Sometimes Dish Network can suck. So, I laid on the couch and was just going to rest for a little bit. Well, that little bit turned into 5 hours. Now I have to go to bed tonight. I get 5 hours sleep usually in one night. Not as a nap! I guess that I am still tired.

      Jenna and I went bridesmaid dress shopping today. Saw a few that we liked at a Jessica McClintock store. I will bring my other bridesmaids up there soon to see what they think.  We have decided to have the reception at the Sea Turtle Inn in Atlantic Beach. Its way over budget but it will be very nice and I will be very happy with it. I am still trying to figure out how to come up with this money. Any little bit helps. Donate a penny.. or 2 cents. Tell your friends. It all adds up.   If you have any ideas for fund raising for my event, please post and let me know.   Thanks!

      I start classes 4 days a week no until Dec 13th I think. Then I will be done with my AA! Woo hoo!  I got my invitations on Friday! They are wonderful. I meant to bring one to work this morning, but I forgot. Oh well, these people can wait to see them when they get it in the mail.  I am still debating on if I want to invite them all. There are some people in here that I just don't like. We'll see. I guess I have a month to figure it out. I plan on mailing the invites after Christmas.   Jenna and Mandy got their BM dresses. They are wonderful as well. I actually tried on Mandy's to get an idea on what size my sister would need and to see how it looked on my body type. It fit and looked great! My sister will be here Saturday. I might get her to just try on Mandy's at my house. I still need to cancel my David's Bridal appointment. Maybe I will do that today.  Mike picked out his tux on Saturday. We are going through Afterhours. He is going to purchase his while everyone else will rent. I thought renting a tux was about $50. Ha! Its going to be $117 but that includes the vest, tie, cufflinks and shoes. I guess its not THAT bad. Its a 3 button jacket with a nitch collar (i think thats what she said) and silver vest and tie. The lady asked if I wanted the groom in silver and everyone else in peri.. I said no. I thought that would look weird. I can't think of a wedding I have seen where the groomsmen were wearing something different. Mike's bout will be different from everyone elses.

      So, my ultrasound came back positve for gallstones. My doctor doesnt know yet because he likes to close at noon on Fridays. The ultrasound lady said that i had a bunch. So we'll see what my doc says on Monday or whenever he decides to call me.  I passed out at the movies last night watching the Matrix. I took a drink of my soda and I swallowed wrong causing my chest to hurt. usually that goes away pretty quick.. next thing I knew the screen was being swallowed by blackness and then I woke up with my popcorn on the floor, my hands kinda up against my chest and I was shaking. Jenna says it was just for a few seconds. Very weird. I didnt feel right the rest of the night. I feel okay this morning though.  Anyway, I have to get my oil changed today. Then we are going to go to the Cummer. For my Humanities class I have to write 7 reviews of modern whatever. I've done a play so now Ill do some art.

      I have had this horrible pain that comes and goes in my side since Monday. I went to the doctor for it today since there was a chance that it could be serious. He poked at me and asked me a bunch of questions and thinks its my gallbladder. He wanted me to get an ultrasound today but I actually ate breakfast. So now I have to wait until Friday. Hopefully its just some stones that can be dissolved if anything. My mother had her gallbladder removed back in the day and my friend Mandy just had hers removed this year. Must be 2 decades between their surgerys and neither of them seemed to have too much fun recovering. Oh.. and my Bp was high. Its never been high.  Getting old sucks.

I forced myself to get up and get around today. sometimes you just have to suck it up and do it. I sure am tired. i think i did too much. So now its back to the couch! tomorrow I need to work on some school work. blah.

      I just got home from work. I am so sick. I left there about 10am. I finished all my work so it was okay. I feel bad since I was off all last week but this is different. I took one of those 24 hour sudefeds this morning and it didnt do crap for me. Mike is sick too but he is more of a trooper than I am. I guess they also need him at his job more than they need me at mine. So I am working on eating some oatmeal, then I'm going to get some rest. I have class tonight. :( But only 4 more classes to go until the semester is over. Yay!

Mike is attempting to fix it. So, lets keep our fingers crossed.  My 1st dress fitting is on the 20th. I hope it stil fits! I've been eating too much peterbrooke. damn chocolate.   Its Christmas time... I'm not too thrilled. I'm not even really interested in getting a tree this year. We'll see. Maybe Mike will really want one so I'll give in.

      I like how they updated the blogger website. Looks more user friendly.  Anyway, a friend of mine said it was my turn to update. I have work to do but I can take some time out.   Looking back....I funded my own wedding. Thanks alot America for helping me out. It was fun planning and I feel that I did a good job with the money that I had. I've heard good things (who would tell you to your face that your wedding sucked anyway) and everyone had a good time. The weather was great. A little windy.. but we weren't outside so it didnt matter. Married life isn't too different from the life I had before March 6th. We went to Ft. Lauderdale for 4 days for our "honeymoon" that was funded by my husbands employer. He had to go down there for business, so it worked out. We plan on taking a 7 day cruise for our 1 year anniversary. It leaves on March 6th, 2005 from P.C.  I can't wait. I love cruising.   I left ECCU in February and got a job at Vystar doing the same thing and making about 20 cents more. Yippie. The move was worth it though. The people are so much better. No more back stabbing bitches!! I dont have to sit in traffic as long either.    I am still going to school. I got my AA degree in Decemeber and am registered at FCCJ as a "self-enrichment" student. I am currently taking a Human Growth and Development class. I need it for nursing if I ever get in. I will know before August if I made it. I have been looking into other choices just in case but nothing looks promising. Everything is offered during the day. I even went to Ultrasound Diagnostic..I think they are called Sanford Brown now.. but anyway they have a Surgical Tech program at night. They also want $18,000. hahahaha! I could understand $5000 even $6000 and would be willing to get a loan for that amount...but not $18000. I need a new car first. But to be able to afford that, I need a new job. Its like a catch-22 I guess. That part of life sucks right now.   What else what else...  Oh, my sister is moving in with us tomorrow. She is supposed to be living with us for about a year. I hope it lasts because she is the funding for the upcoming cruise! It will be strange having a roommate again, but we will get used to it. No more running around the house nekkid and stuff.  I also want to move away. Especially to some place like South Florida or the Fl Keys. I just love it down there. It all way overpriced. I found a trailer in Key Largo for $150,000. Yes, I said trailer.   Well, I guess thats a fairly decent update. Time to get back to work.

      1,000 THINGS words & music by jason mraz  'I'm overjoyed and over loved and feeling lucky   like a little boy who's hiding under covers  and looking to discover any way to play the part inside his darkened cave  well the meaning of life it starts at the nightlight  close your eyes and hope to see mine     well I've seen a thousand things in one place  but I stopped my counting when I saw your face  erasing memory I feel as though I've never seen a face before   until I saw your eyes smiling back at me thru my tears  I've been counting all these years  Now suddenly the thousand things I've seen were   nothing more than dreams of you and me     you and me quietly at a stand still  fortunately you will kiss me and I'll kiss you back  fact of the matter of is that I don't know what the latter is  that I always wanted to kiss you but   I always wanted to run from you  Because I always wanted to miss you   And that I've always wanted to come for you    So... how do you do?

      So, I had Perfect Climate Heating and Air come out to the house yesterday to do a clean and check on my system. I know that it is 28 years old.. and yes I expected him to tell me that we needed a new system. He pointed out a bunch of things that were wrong. After he left, wouldn't you know the system ran and ran for four hours straight. We guess that the stress that he had to put on the system to test it was too much for it to handle. What luck! So, we are getting an entire new heating and air system installed tomorrow. $3195 - Mike had originally told me $3100 and thats all I asked to be financed. I am still trying to find out if there is going to be taxes on it.   So, for all of you out there thinking about buying a house... go for it...if you have at least $20,000 in the bank after closing. sheesh

      I leave work today at 3:15. Only 35 more minutes to go. I figure that I will waste it updating my blog.  Why am I leaving early? I have an eye doctors appointment. I havent seen the eye doctor since I left AOL which was 2 years ago. Seems like a lot longer. Its all a distance memory. Things that went on come to me every once in a while and bring a smile to my face. I met a lot of really neat people there. The best times were when I was on the Techs 4 Evers team I believe. Yeah, I was stressed but I wasn't quite that bad yet. I could sit and listen to  people all day and just watch the chat room. The Macintosh reps still only took Macintosh calls. Those were the days.  Anyway, my sister has gotten my into reading Harry Potter. I started book one on Thursday and was done on Saturday. Started book two that same day and I will be done today. They are very good books. I hadn't seen any of the movies either so Saturday morning we watched the 1st one. When I finish the 2nd book, I will watch that movie and hopefully I will be done with the 3rd book before it leaves the theatre.  :)  Spent the weekend tearing up the bushes that were in front of the house. Now my hamstrings hurt. I think it looks better without all of the crappy bushes but Mike doesnt think so. We will plant something else there soon. Once the money tree decides to give me some more cash.  Still have 25 mins to go.   So, the crap overseas is getting worse everyday. This hostage crap is getting old. I feel bad for the families and for the person that did/will experience a horrible death. But you just can't negotiate with terrorists. Whos to say that they wont kill the person anyway if you meet their demands. It just shows them your weakness. I heard that poor Korean man crying how he didnt want to die on the radio this morning. Poor guy. But its not going to matter. I should check boortz.com to see if he has anything to say about it. That will tick some more time off the clock.
