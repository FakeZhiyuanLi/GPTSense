      got an awful case of the shakes right now so its kinda hard to get my hands to press the right keys. not sure if its the sickness in my body breaking up or if its the medicine im taken, either way its a real irritation. so, i am feeling a little better. last night i felt like my head was about to explode from all the sinus pressure. but its now just turned into a cough and rainy nose.i had a really fun day today. we went to the fine art(alright so i dont know how to spell museum. after that we went to some mountain area where a native area is set up. the landscape is mind blowing. its a tropical mountain-scape with lots of colors painted on walls and buildings. we made our way from there down to the bottom of this gorge that a river has cut its way through. i think i was able to take some really good pictures down there of some native kids that were playing in the river, and a beautiful sunset over the mountains in the horizon. the natives were very friendly. they had cooked some fresh water shrimp over a fire in two beer cans with the tops cut off packed with shrimp and then pressed back together. its actually an excellent way to cook them if you want to know how to have shrimp when your camping. they were kind enough to share a packed can and some watermelon with us.

      heres a word from my best friend in austin. i thought i would be worth sharing so i decided i had to post it. ZZZ austin tx  ----------------------------------------------------------------  How to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  1. Obtain two slices of bread. 2. Spread peanut butter on one slice. 3. Spread jelly on the other. 4. Put the two slices of bread together. 5. Eat. 6. Try not to choke as you think about the ignorant paranoia of the United States' foreign policy.  Why do people hate the US? Maybe because we violate international laws, torture prisoners, bomb houses, kill civilians, never say sorry, etc...................

      musta forgot my vaccinations cuz i cant breathe not sure if its some kind of foriegn plague thats made its way up into my nasal cavaties or if its just allergies actually i think its just the air but it would sound much cooler if it was some tropical plague just got back from some kinda sales pitch luncheon some money makin schemes about investing in this and these are the results or try this road and see real results its all bullshit if it was such a great idea  do you think they would share it with  everyone maybe  but i highly doubt it me and ivery just showed up for her mom because she wasnt feeling well either i would never complain about going to these taiwanese feast though there is more food served at these things than you could ever imagine and the way they are served is very interesting as well a traditional meal is served as follows they bring out a plate of food everyone eats they bring out another plate everyone eats that  and this goes on until they have served about ten plates with everyone just picking here and there but its the same way every time we go with Zimbaba or iverys stepdad i like the idea its alot more fun than just getting one big plate of food all to yourself you get taste everything

      last night we went to this little place outside of the city. a nice resturaunt up on this hill that serves wild chicken. and chicken anything you can think of. chicken soup, fried chicken, boiled chicken, baked chicken, chicken on a stick, rubber chicken, chicken gumbo(sound like Forest Gump yet), but many other things as well. lets see, yes i also had fried grasshoppers there, which actually go really well with beer. iverys mom said they were bumble bees, but because they looked more like grasshoppers to me i will describe them as that. theres a beautiful view of the city on one side where the pacific breeze washes over your skin leaving it damp but cool. there are some natives that come up to the resturaunt and do there tribal dancing and singing which is an outstanding performance. dressed in lavish colors and different shells sewn into there clothes the pacific islander theme is in full effect. there launguage is alot different than taiwnaese i think it even sound a little more samoan than of a chinese tone. there look is very native as well. i will have to go back because i didnt get any pictures of them. any hahahah, im out

      i have heard the comparison of taiwan and uganda whether its relevent or not i dont know but i do know thaat with the election of chen it has left the people of taiwan completely split some afraid some angry like everywhere else the government seems to have the power to turn its own people on each other its not my country so i cannot make to many personal comments on the misbehavior but i can say there were some very dirty deeds to get chen in office for instance  the assasination attempt seems to be a complete fraud the more i hear about how it would have helped not just from pity votes but also because he only has the support of 8% of military and police and because of the heightened security on the day of voting the police and military were not allowed to vote so it seems to be planned to keep them from the poles although in some ways i think it would be beneficial to the taiwanese people  to have their independence and their own constitution. communist china still has many laws that prevent people from thinking for themselves laws on freedom of speech and press are still very pressing on promoting CHina only in positive form like i say though its not my country, and i do see how there is fear  from the strong hand of china especially with the US saying that if something happens between the two ;countries they are not writing a blank check for taiwan to defend themselves but thats because most of our manufaturing is in china so for many reasons  the US (must turn its face to prevent unstable relations with CHina)

      today is the day that Chen will be resworn in as president for his second term. there seems to be alot of debate about this guy. i believe alot of people are afraid of how relations with china will play out with him in office. he represents the (DPP)Democratic Progressive Party which is seen as a threat to China. Beijing warns that he will be crushed if he leads the island closer to independence. so it is a big day for Taiwans political moves.

      nothin much to do tonight but watch chinese TV that aint for me never been too much for TV just me and my thoughts im willin to share to whoevers got the time to stare at the glare  of a computer screen sometimes things dont have to make much sense maybe do sumthin you know you'll repent sometimes it feels good  to forget about a thing called logic or stare at an object  that makes you feel nostalgic sometimes it feels good  to forget about direction just ridin thru the breeze inside a colorful dream. sometimes you got to make up new words and forget about everything  you've always HEARD and re-arrange sentances like _lamb he say the aint he got no fur_

      typhoon seems to be changing course. im sure there will be more. i remember all the excitment of the hurricanes when i lived on the east coast, and i miss the intensity of the storms. i went down to where most of the locals do there shopping to find a heavy influence of american culture. all of the shops are outdoors kind of what we would consider a flea market(sp). the streets are very tight and people still sqeezing thru on their motorcycles. ivery is pretty good at driving these little things, although i must say i am still very nervous about the other drivers and the taxi drivers. i got my chance to drive around in the alley in front of the house but i dont think i will be venturing out much further. i still dont understand the traffic rules. it seems more or less like people just drive where ever they feel like going and no-one really gets mad or confused. i think you would be shot in houston for making some of the traffic errors they do here. and surprisingly i think i have only seen two accidents.  the police seem to be far and few between. the only sign of police ive seen since the airport was at one of the traffic accidents. and as far as foriegners, i believe ive seen one girl and one couple. thats it. i dont believe this is exactly the tourist hotspot which is exactly what i wanted. alot of places seem to be so set up for tourism they have completely gotten lost in accomidating to keep foreigners comfortable, leading to a tainted view of what youve come to see. NOT HERE> until later _signing off_

      so yesterday i woke up with a migraine headache. i cant tell you how bad the pollution is here. it really makes you respect the clean air acts they have in the west. theres no way they could do that here because i dont think many people could afford to maintain their transportation the way they do back home. we went to work yesterday with iverys mom and stepdad. they own a resturaunt down at the university. its on the side of this mountain that looks out over the mighty pacific which lies just across a bridge. its a beautiful view of the harbour. you can imagine its hard for me to do to much at the front desk because i cant understand much more than hello, thankyou and a couple of other words. so for a majority of the time i was able to sit and watch the boats pull in and out of the harbour, while i wrote my thoughts and entertain the children who want to hear a foreigner say hello, and then run away giggling. its a very warming jesture. things as small as the lizards , birds and trees keep me in awe because they are all a little different than what i am used to seeing back home. i was taken out to lunch to have duck rice and duck (parts) soup which was really good but like everything i have eaten here so far, very different. then i was on my way to take on the  monkees. we stopped at this beautiful buddhist temple on the way up where its customary to stop and give your respect and from there we started our hike up the mountain. it was a pretty good climb up. before you get to the top, some buddhist have set up an area where you stop and drink hot tea. now remember the weather here is very hot and very humid so your covered in sweat drinking boiling tea. but its supposed regenerate your energy. some kind of wheat tea. its very good. so im feeling very excited about seeing the monkees when i look over and standing right next to me maybe 4 ft is a little monkee watching me. and up  ahead monkees all over the ground. everyone was very excited because apparently someone had just been robbed of their bread. i swear to god i wouldnt have believed it either but it was true these monkees are gangsters. prowlers. thieves. pirates. banditos. lacking only the patch, the parrot, and the sword. one woman was pulling a sandwich out of her bag and out of no where one runs up from behind, grabs the bag, and jumps in a tree where the others come over and share the loot. they will also steal purses thinking theres food inside.  later last night we were invited to have dinner with her stepdads friends where i learn some taiwanese traditions. for instance. i felt nothing like drinking because of the earlier migrane but tradition says you dont turn something down thats offered to you. food, beer, cigarettes,drugs(just kidding about the last). and when someone toast you, which happens alot, you must drink the same amount as them and if theres nothing in your glass you must fill it up. i had three different men that kept toasting me and it is only polite to call a toast back minutes later, so it didnt take long to feel a bit toasted. but that wasnt it, they kept ordering beer and food, so im full, drunk and tired and i must keep going. yeah needless to say i woke up this morning with another headache. well i must end this letter im really enjoying writing my experiences, so check often if you like. we are watching a typhoon thats suppose to hit either the 18,19, or 20. that will be fun. for me at least. bye for now.                                *dAnIeL*

      whats up im sitting here in a cyber cafe in kaohsiung. i havent yet gotten used to the time change yet so im up early every day. i get a chance to stand on top of the 12 story building we are living in, to look out over the city and watch the sun rise. its a beautiful way to start the day. there is a relly pretty mountain out behind us. its totally different than what i ever could have imagined. after 24  hrs of chasing the sun on our journey here, it strange to find that we had skipped a day. we left on thursday morning at 9:30am and we arrived here on friday night 10:45pm. but because we crossed the international date line we lost 12 hrs. strange eye. this place is completely crowded. unlike american cities, everything is built straight up all around. you could say its like 7 cities built on top of each other and on every strret side there is a shop or resturaunt of some sort. people zipping around everywhere on there motorcycles and the god-damn taxi drivers seem to be the post WW2 kamikazi fighter pilots who are out of work. you definately dont take the chance of walking in the street without first looking very well. I was invited to a chinese wedding last night so me and ivery went to see what it was like. much much food. fish of all kind. really great experience. her family is very nice. we are suppose to go out to this mountain today to check out these monkees that live in the woods. supposedly they have been known to rob people for food. it sounds a little exagerated to me, so i must go check out if its true or not. i guess i better do some exercising before just in case, i would hate to be caught in a surprise attack. hiyah.                                     well ill write later *dAnIeL*

      every so often beneath the black sheets of darkness i see the full spectrum of color, from dust blown up into a sun-setting sky with this the sound  of the desert winds blowing up into the sangre de cristos. it stirs the tops of the pinion trees and russles the russian olive, the cool night creeping down through the arroyos and into my one man camp. under the sounds  of the mountains at night there is utter silence. the silence of being alone. on the edge of the wilderness the great spirit and i dance around the adobe fire, and in the midst  of my dry desert dance, the thunderbird flaps his wings and finds flight behind the mountain on which i sleep. the earth seems to shake and tremble. i watch the flashes, the sharp geometric arms of the lightning reaching over the peaks, finding new places in the sky to bury their energy. and i find communion with the watcher of the desert, in the spirit of Santa Fe.

      one more sound to free the sunshine from losing orbit around the blank bliss which sucks the energy from surrounding neutral fields. lost... free... directionless with the ability to care less each and every day not really losing contact but forced into submission every excuse to break the chain that holds tightly onto nothing but everything is your loss of existance and birds fly and scream at your whistle taking shape in the inhilation from a mighty huka smoke ball releasing noxious gasses from your spine making all the little carnivours feasting on your flesh to scamper off looking for a new host of immagrants to sieze as they make their escape deep within the chambers of the shipping ferry carrying tons and tons of blackmarket dolphin meat and porpoise heads and shark fins

      to make sense of any of the story "under the red sun" you will have to start on the one titled mission failure. our dimwitted confused hero is now stuck in a chinese prison after being sold over to the chinese by his girlfriend(he believes). the name "under the red sun" reflects his partial ignorance to everything that exist, considering the red sun is usually a reference to japan. but as you will see in later chronicles his half brained thoughts, interactions and plans are to him a genius mastermind plan. but arent we all egotistical enough to believe that we are right. whether it be our beliefs or ideas or philosophical ideas. maybe some extreme cases can seem funny but in reality or what we call our reality, or our personal perspective, the jokes on that. its just a little story i had playing that i will keep running as long as i have a plot just a little entertainment when im not busy which is hard to be during really hot times of the day because the air pollution just sits in the humidity at certain times of the day in fact the people here are more night people because of that the heat and humidity and pollution of course so i must find ways to entertain my brain and so i say  gonzo entertainment is open for business

      the translater had long left i tried to understand why he sounded confused when i asked about my charge was he not informed of my reason for being here or did i not know why i was here? i dreamed of a cigarette my addiction had left me with a splitting headache and the stress was overwhelming i swore to everything i believed in that as soon as i was free i would stop in the first church or temple or mosque to swear my faith to the god that got me out of this mess which is strange because i hadnt had a religious experiance of this magnitude since the plane flight in during a little turbulance im not saying i pray when im scared just when i think im going to die of course once we landed i had completely forgotten my vow until now ahhhh was god angry  these were my thoughts till the door opened and in a long white coat stood a man

      it had been what seemed like hours the cold floor made it hard to sleep but i believe i was able to rest my body some it needs it i believe im broken and bleeding but its to dark to inspect the wounds i heard footsteps approach the door and someone calling out in chinese i replied i dont understand then someone whom im guessing was the translater yelled back of course you dont stupid its in chinese so i listened trying to make sense but its impossible when you cant see the faces gestures are a very important translating tool but i couldnt even see the shadows but i imagined them as anyone would i imagined them at guiatines and i imagined them holding rifles and i imagined all the forms of ancient chinese torture and i imagined samuris wanting me for practice fighting and sadly that was the class i slept through during spy training. the translater i assume that was his job leaned down to the crack under the door are you hurt he asked i told him i believe i need to see a doctor i asked what they were going to charge me with "charge you with" he asked "why would you be charged with anything?" for being a spy i replied a spy?

      im back with a little more energy than last i found one rat as i was laying here in this dark cell i looked for some way to cook the meat i decided the only way to survive would be to eat it raw. now ive eaten sushimi and i even like it but this was totally different it was still warm disgusting and i am severly afraid that it could carry disease but you must do what you need in survival situations but heres the kicker as i finished scarfing down the little creature theres a knock at the door and then the sound of a tray sliding under the door and as i crawled towards the crack under the door i begin to smell food they werent intent on starving me i had eaten the rat for nothing they had brought me a large bowl of rice its hard not understanding the situation damnit the thought of that poor little rat made me sick the idea of it took away my appetite, and my rice and fish lay by the door as i prayed my way to sleep to any and every god that was listening

      there were huge fields  wide open pastures we were all in one that had been cleared somewhere in the US everyone i know and everyone i have ever known there were giant tv screens at different corners of the fields with news flashes running across them it was a time of fear breaking news you know the feeling of excitment when they say those words "BREAKING NEWS" well they kept showing this image of 2 unidentifiable flying objects one being 1/4 the size of the larger one but i wasnt watching the tv screens because when i looked in the sky they were there above my head in fact they were in every major city across the world then during one of the briefs they interupted the broadcast and gave us strict instructions on how to lay in rows, side to side IIIIIIIII                                     IIIIIIIII                                     IIIIIIIII there were little mechanical men hurrying around helping us get lined up beeping and buzzing but never speaking their leader from inside the craft had taken on a human figure along with i guess others in his top cabinet or council it was then they explained that we had been a great experiment and we had not only turned on each other, as the savage beast they had also created to keep the ecosystem balanced,  but we had also destroyed our home our planet they were here to keep us from contaminating much deeper into the galaxies and we all understood at that moment we all knew our fates but with caring and gentleness they led us into a deep sleep which was very comfortable very colorful very peaceful floating blissfully over the earth back in its original form and i awoke

      so there is always room for new inspiration something....... a song  a book a painting a woman a loss theres always energy to release a word that can summ up fears thoughts happiness sadness curiosity its not the lack of words its learning the right words to use its learning to take the breathes necessary to sustain life to take steps to move in and move out to jump and scream or to find peaceful meditation in a quiet pine forest breathe in release breathe in escape exhale jump and scream laugh at the ghost pray to the gods speak to the living  to find out how you died break the lock to release the skeletons walk in beat to the great Sachmo breathe the rythem of a gonzo flute lose yourself in the exstasy of a music note breathe color and live excited

      and maybe this will all stay unanswered questions may this all stay a daydream refreshed in whimsical journeys through rivers and forest in cool mountain air and may my spirit rise high above things tasted and lost savoring the moment i'd trade at no cost and this dream i compare to a favorite poem which is always to short but in its short verse true beauty is unveiled or a favorite song that starts and ends before your feet catch the groove the mood the soothing qualities the touch the gentle fingers gliding over skin thick sensation quivering chest deep breaths silk ambrosia wine smile laughter flight and i may let myself believe that maybe it would have been better to not have tasted something so sweet something which has been a dream for so long and maybe i should have released the known of what would be and fill every desire i have so whether it was a surge of released passion or a move on something you felt I, my sweet daydream, will always hold you first when i think of something special..........................

      there are more words bubbling out from my lips and more thoughts than i have power to control there is nothing more that i wish i could have than more time to enjoy this sound, color, smell, kiss, touch, mystery...... your presence has buried itself deep in my soul and i battle with what i know will come spiraling down the vortex towards a small black hole where it will soon disappear and flip as things do into its next great cycle............ i need you to know that nothing has ever felt more beautiful nothing has ever felt more passionate energetic nothing has ever touched as deeply in my core than the feeling when my lips touch yours passing through my body like a shock i become submerged in cosmic magnetism trying to force myself not to look into your eyes because i know what i will find only reaffirms the exterior beauty and the need i feel to pull my body closer you have become the color for a painter the word for a poet the whisper for a screamer and a feeling for the numb
