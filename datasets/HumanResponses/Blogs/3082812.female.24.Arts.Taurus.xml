      The first club type place I went to was at The Power Station in about '94, when I was 14. It was an underage party called The Brain and I think the music was some kind of happy hardcore/hard house/trance stuff, but I'm not sure. Around that time we also went to parties at Arcadia, Club Parnell and Sunset Palms, where the music was more about Snoop Dog and The Jackson Five. At that time in NZ the drinking age was 20 - it's now 18 - and it was actually a lot easier to get into places if you were underage because they were way less vigilante. In '96 I started going to proper clubs: The Box, Calibre and Squid, as well as a number of semi-illegal underground venues in the Downtown/Viaduct area. The Box had Brit Pop events and later a Thursday night hip hop party called The Realness that my friends all went to. Calibre had the seminal Thursday night Breakz sessions, featuring Pots, Riddle, Aaron and 48 sonic. Squid hosted various events but I only went to the dnb parties; most memorably the Metalheadz Platinum Breaks release party in '96. There was often house playing upstairs in the main club room but I didn't have an ear for it back then. The Box and Squid are now defunct; Calibre is still going strong.   I think the current Auckland clubbing scene is solid. People complain that it's superficial or tired or limited or whatever but I disagree. Numbers may drop off as mainstream party-goers move on to the next thing or older clubbers opt to stay home more often, but the underground will always remain because of the people who genuinely love the music and persevere in making careers out of it: DJs, promoters, producers, bar staff, managers, label operators and venue owners. The local talent is getting stronger and stronger and quality internationals are constantly coming through, though people aren't always clued up enough to do their presence justice. I'm not living in Auckland right now and some of these places might have closed. For current information check&nbsp; urlLink www.worlddj.com  or  urlLink www.biggie.co.nz      Calibre  K Rd  An infamous venue that specialises in twisted deep house. It has just one main area with a bar at one end, a dancefloor in the middle with some booths/seating round the sides, and a lounge down the far end. It's open till 8am, which is great; but it means people often spend the night somewhere else then go down there late, unless there's a particular party on. I've been kicked out 3x for drunk and disorderly behaviour. The first time was in '96 when I was frustrated by the fact I had to get all dressed up to get in every week when all I wanted to do was listen to the music. So one night I wore a red adidas tracksuit, trainers and a cap and they refused me entrance, so I snuck in and then the police came down for a random check and they threw me out. The second time I had been at Roger Sanchez the night before and drinking all day and we went down there as soon as it opened and I was singing "wherever you go I'll follow you" loudly and badly (Sanchez had played the new EBTG mix), and they understandably escourted me out. The third time was very unpleasant. I had been down there the night before and, again, drinking all day as well as smoking that hideous substance known as P, and was suffering some kind of identity crisis. I got abusive and sat on the bar and was promptly evicted and banned for about a month.    Ink Bar  K Rd  Ink has a small dancefloor but it feels much bigger when it's packed. It's also just a really nice place to hang out with a cave-like lounge area and a lovely outdoor chill zone. It has the best staff in town and some of the best DJs spin there too.    K Rd Ballroom  K Rd  This is a sweet place to shoot some pool and have a few beers. They play an eclectic range of decent music and sometimes there's a DJ in the back bar.    Bacio/Kiss  K Rd  Bevan Keys and Soane used to have their Thursday night deep house party up at Bacio and that attracted a decent crowd of pre-weekend clubbers but it was never somewhere I chose to go on the weekends. It seems to have consistently underperformed even though it's a spacious venue with pool tables, a large bar, a good dancefloor and everything else you could want in a club. By comparision, Kiss is a hard house joint that's often packed till very late. I don't really know what goes on inside.    4:20  K Rd  If you like hip hop then this is the place to go. Formerly a dark, dirty den known as Sinners, the space has been opened up and the club now occupies a large, long room with large windows affording excellent views of Auckland city down the far end. The dancefloor is up the other end and the bar is in the middle. 4:20 is about the most bling-bling "hood rich" place in Auckland but is still low-key. Check it.    Galatos  Galatos St  This is a 3-level building with a dark club in the basement, a kind of dancehall in the middle and a lounge at the top. Because of this, Galatos is good place to drink and talk, or dance and listen, depending on which part you go to on the night. Sometimes they have one-price parties over all three zones that cover every genre, from dub to hip hop to house. However, the quality of the artists was occasionally let down by the low quality and high volume of the soundsystem.    76  Pitt St  This place used to be a whiskey bar (can't remember the name) and I really liked it. It was a little old-fashioned with big comfortable booths and windows looking out onto the street. Now it's a bit of a twisters bar. They make good cocktails, stay open late and have DJs spin underground music, from hip hop to house.    Pitch  Pitt St  Pitch is all black and red and has a great big round door, a good soundsystem, and a friendly Israeli proprietor. He's got a great&nbsp;selection of&nbsp;fresh and eclectic&nbsp;CDs and also has the gear for live DJing. It's a nice bar, I hope it does well.    The Supper Club  Beresford St  This little place has so much potential and it's always changing in one way or another so maybe one day they'll get it spot on and it'll be totally rocking. They're open as a cafe by day but it's always pretty quiet even though it's in a nice part of town and has lots of outdoor tables. They sometimes host parties like Dancing in the Streets and they did an open-decks night and stuff like that, but I've only ever really gone to the club the morning after I've been somewhere else. It used to be open till around 12pm and all manner of people would show up from every kind of party imaginable - private dinner to hard house rave - so sometimes it would be crazy and you'd need to put your best foot forward to survive; other times it'd be chill sitting round drinking some tea and nipping round the road for a joint with your new mates. I'm not sure if all that's still going on.    Luminaire  Beresford St  A white vodka bar with lots of vodka, Luminaire can seem kind of sterile unless it's full of people. It was the first place in town to implement a non-smoking policy and so people sit on some tables and chairs outside on the pedestrian-only street. Good for private functions or serious drinking and they occasionally have some interesting little parties with the assistance of twin CD-J decks.    Khuja Lounge  Queen St  Khuja is a bit of an institution and is popular with the alternative kind of muso type misfits of AK society. It's a fun place to drink when it's quiet, with views over uptown AK, but it can be a bit uncomfortable when it's packed for special events. Also, they have a strange door policy that I've never quite figured out - like you must wear sneakers and must not wear shoes? A case of inverted snobbery perhaps... But at least the music is reliably good.    St James/Grand Circle  Queen St  St James is an enormous venue-for-hire. The Grand Circle is a self-contained club that can be accessed by a stairwell inside the St James or by a separate entrance on Lorne St. Parties at the St James are totally dependent on who or what is playing that night. At it's best, the place will be full of attractive, up-for-it party people that know their tunes and you can traipse around endlessly through the many zones. At its worst, it may be empty or full of kids. The Grand Circle is a lovely space. It has classical details about the place, a clearly marked dancefloor and plenty of seating, as well as a delightful parlor area in which the ladies can refresh themselves. Lightspeed held Dick Johnson's Electric parties there in 01 or 02 or 03, I can't remmeber. They were fantastic parties with fresh music and a great vibe. I'm not sure if the GC is open every weekend now; it may only be open for special events.    Fu Bar/Fu  Queen St  Fu Bar, aka Fucked up Beyond All Repair, opened first and then the opportunity arose to buy the space next door so the owners grabbed it and opened Fu, which is a decent-sized club. Over time they've tweaked the decor and sound system so that it's now a wicked place to get messed up and listen to the deeper, darker end of electronica. All the major dnb internationals play there and it's also good for techno, breaks, hip hop and strictly underground house.    The Wyndam Bowling Club  Wyndam St  This club opened a few years ago and kind of took over from Calibre as being the place you could guarantee would be good any time of night, rather than just the last crazy hours. Unfortunately it suffered a fire in March '04 and is apparently not operational anymore, which is a shame because there was a solid crew running it, the music was always excellent and the soundsystem was probably the best in town.    Centro  Wyndam St  I was reluctant to go there when it first opened because I thought it was a bit of a show-pony corporate joint but once I overcame my prejudice and went along for a quiet drink I was quite impressed. It's a beautiful club with a large lounge, lots of seating around the edge of a big dancefloor, good sound and a nice VIP room out the back. The a la carte restaurant failed but they recruited an old-school vet to book the talent and Centro is now host to some quality local parties and serious internationals.    Crow Bar  Wyndam St  Crow is a kind of unofficial Boys club. The staff are all male and kitted out in formal attire with dry humours to match. They have a reasonably tight door policy and sometimes the place is packed with beautiful, drunk people lounging around in the leather booths and chairs. It's also a favorite mid-week haunt of the many hip Japanese people now living in AK. Music is not a central feature of the Crow Bar experience but they occasionally host small live gigs and there is a separate lounge upstairs where they sometimes have DJs play. The latter is brighter than the former and has a pool table and a tank full of fish: ideal for private parties.    Elbow Room/The Loft  Durham Lane  This is a perfect place to catch a drink in the city during the day and they have happy hour specials in the evenings. At night, The Loft opens upstairs. It's an attractive small bar with cool staff and upcoming DJs spinning nice house, making an ideal venue to go before or between clubs.    Deshlers  High St  You should go to Deschlers and get a drink: everyone else does. It's kind of a jazz bar and they do a great job of supporting underground live acts on the weekends and serving cheap drinks during the week. They have a sister-bar on Ponsonby Rd called  Verboten . Both are unpretentious havens for semi-alcoholics.    Met Bar  High St  The grand old building where Cardiac was before it's early demise. I've never been inside the new incarnation but I'm assuming it fills the same market; market being the operative word. Meat, money, whatever: it just aint really my scene. Assuming it hasn't changed drastically, it has a large bar, an upstairs cocktail lounge and a basement club. Cardiac also had a hilarious VIP bar, accessed with a PIN number, that had a Seven Deadly Sins theme. I don't know if Met Bar has retained the space for that purpose or not.    Honey/Moth  O'Connell St  Honey is a nice bar with big sofas, dim lighting and an ambitious drinks list that includes many of their own infused vodkas. Moth is the upstairs club but I've never been there.    Morrison  Fort St  I haven't ever been there because it opened after I left town but early reports have been favorable. Leading the Fort St renaissance, it's apparently a well-designed modern venue with an upstairs bar area and a downstairs club all kitted out with an excellent sound system. Greg Churchill had a party there to celebrate the release of his first track on Darren Emerson's Underwater label, and they're my favorite DJs from NZ and the UK respectively so it gets my vote even unseen.    Spy Bar  The Viaduct  This could be a nice little club but the clientele are more about the scene than the music and so it's sometimes quite appalling. But also sometimes really fun and tehy're open till about 10am on the weekend.    Coast  The Viaduct  Another beautiful space with panoramic views of Auckland city and harbour but you're best picking a particular party to go to rather than just rocking up on an average night because it can be kind of wack.    Bellini  Hilton Hotel, Viaduct  If you're the kind of person that looks at the price of drinks on the list then you probably shouldn't bother going here. But if you like drinking nice cocktails in nice bars with nice views of the ocean then it should be ideal. I tend to avoid it on key nights like Friday when it might attract a suited older crowd, but it's lovely during the day with its classically modern decor and many seating options. The best night I had there was when Phully hosted a party featuring Simon Grigg and Mr Keys on the decks. Class class class.    Bubble  Viaduct  This is just a little bar tucked away in the corner of the main throroughfare. As the name would suggest, it's good for drinking champagne. At night it can get really busy but is usually quiet during the day and fun for a liquid snack, if not a whole lunch.    Pickle  Albert St  Formerly The Hobson St Lounge, Pickle is a good option for late night drinking in the city and is also open for lunch. It's apparently the brainchild of the people that did  Lime  (Ponsonby),  Ruby  (Kingsland) and  Plum  (Viaduct) but I don't think they still own and operate all of them. I used to live above Pickle and there was an elevator that went directly up from the bar, which was very convenient though we had to use the street to get down there. They have a good liquor selection and some delicious, if pricey, tapas type food. The space is well designed but the music was often boring or bad. The other bars are hip in a fairly similar way: Plum is like a bit of Ponsonby on the viaduct in amidst the pervasive Parnell vibe; Lime is often packed with people I don't personally enjoy being packed with; I think Ruby has definitely been sold and the clientele reflect Kingsland's status as a desirable suburb.    Chicane  Ponsonby Rd  A nice bar with DJs sometimes spinning nice tunes. The drinks are good and there are fun little booths with curtains so you can have a bit of a private party if you so desire. A top post-dinner, pre-club destination. Downstairs is a bar called  Sponge  but I'd avoid it unless you like rugby more than music.    Oval Bar  Pionsonby Road  An attractive street-level bar with a couple of tables on a balcony thing out the back and a decent soundystem. DJs sometimes spin there and the service is good.    Safari  Ponsonby Rd  This place is perfect for having a few beers and shooting some pool or chilling outside in the courtyard. They have (had?) a big hip hop party on Wednesday nights that's very popular with students and bros alike. On the weekends they have DJs spin other kinds of music too. It's a good spot.    Korova Bar  Kingsland  I've never been there but some friends of friends run it and I see they book some of my friends to spin so it can't be bad. And it's in Kingsland, which is a cute area that's slowly on the make. The space used to be The Black Dog and I went there a couple of times when I was living round the corner; it's a shame to lose a pub when Auckland has so few but a good DJ bar is always useful too.     urlLink    urlLink

      Sometimes described as Pacific Rim, New Zealand cuisine doesn't have anything particularly unique about it but its point of difference lies in our willingness to combine the best of other cultures and our ability to use the finest ingredients relatively cheaply. NZ is also quite good at making wine. I think we could do with more restaurants that have that semi-glam party kind of vibe, because it's not like you actually go out to dinner to eat, is it?    General:    Rocco, Prego, Otto, Cibo, Euro   Yes, they all end in O. And I've also grouped them together because they are all quality. The vibe is different at each but what they have in common is excellent food and service and a discerning clientele. If you want music and fun, go to Rocco. If you want quiet sophistication, go to Otto. The others are somewhere in between though Prego is probably the most affordable and casual, so very conducive to many bottles of wine over pizza.   Independent Fast-ish Food  Burger Fuel, Kebab Kid and Al&Pete's make delicious food fairly quickly for a reasonable price. You can find quality restaurants in most places in the world but not everywhere has simple options like these: they're ideal. One or more of them can be found in Ponsonby, Mt Eden and Parnell.   Ponsonby Road   There are a lot of cafes down the length of P Rd, catering for everyone from dressed-down hipsters to dressed-up housewives. For eating, my pick would be Bambina. For hanging out I'd go to Santos and take a table in the courtyard that's used by Safari Bar at night. It's fairly obvious which are kind of cool and which are kind of wack but it's not like your life will end if you drink one bad coffee, overhear one bad conversation or eat one bad panini.      Herne Bay   Like Ponsonby, there are quite a lot of cafes in the area but they're on a shorter strip of road and cater for a similar kind of crowd. If you eat out for breakfast, lunch and dinner then you'll probably discover the points of difference for yourself; generally they've got a chill vibe and nice food. Andiamo, Scoozi and The Cooker are almost neighbours and they've all got a couple of tables on the street. Down the way are some excellent delis and bakeries too.   Vulcan Lane  City There are a number of eateries on this short pedestrian-only street so if you're lost in downtown AK just head there and take your pick. There are pubs for beer and chips, a little place for healthy salads, a sushi bar, and a few cafes for coffee and everything else.   Japanese Restaurants  City There are a couple of good places on upper Queen St in amidst all the other Chinese and Korean spots. Down the road a little is Tanuki's Restaurant upstairs and Tanuki's Cave downstairs; both are cool and tasty. Back up Queen St and round the corner On K Rd you'll find Ken's Yakitori, which has plenty of space upstairs for a bit of a party.    Specific:    SPQR/Chandelier   Ponsonby These two adjacent restaurants would seem quite different if you just popped your head in but they fill the same kind of niche. SP is dark and can feel like a quality afterparty with all your mates; the other is ostentatious and better for a pre-party. The food is good but somehow irrelevant.   Provence Ponsonby This place is supposed to be French but I guess that just means the food has to be pretty decent and the decor fairly smart; it's just a quiet spot to go for dinner if you're not wildly wanting to be seen or whatever. I believe it has a cocktail bar called Red.     Sawadee  Ponsonby The best Thai in town. Spicy as you like, good beer and quirky decor.   Vinnies  Herne Bay Immaculate restaurant with nouveau takes on classic cuisine. Maybe not ideal for a party with the girls but good for a serious talk with the men or a family occasion, which is why I wnt there. Think large glasses of red wine and a perfectly cooked eye fillet, or whatever else you like to imagine.    Red  Herne Bay This is a bustling Italian restaurant with a flamboyant host and lively atmosphere. One time when I ate there the service was a little slow and the food went from a fantastic starter to a plain main that we didn't really want by the time it arrived, but it's a good place to eat all the same.   White  Hilton Hotel, Viaduct White is mostly white and it's at the Hilton so if you have experienced such places or have a little imagination you'll be able to guess what it's like; I think it's an attractive space but rather devoid of atmosphere. Like anywhere, however, if you went with a merry group of people and drank a bit of champagne you'd probably have a right old time. The key feature is the view: the restaurant is located at the end of the pier on the second floor so it's all very Auckland. Be sure to get a cocktail at Bellini downstairs.     Antoines  Parnell One of the oldest, most expensive restaurants in town. If you don't have much money I wouldn't bother saving all your hard-earned pennies to go along. But if it's no problem to invest a little money into a night of superb cuisine and fine liquor then by all means do it. It's particularly suitable for more formal occasions or if you're going out with an older crowd, say your wealthy grandparents. I'm mad about tuna and they served me an enormous slab, cooked to prefection, on some caramelised onions. My father, I believe, took advantage of the Classic Menu and had tripe.    Thai Friends  Parnell Good Thai from a friendly little shop on one of Auckland's more pretentious strips.   Delicious  Grey Lynn The best Italian in town. It was unlicenced when I was last there because it's in the heart of a little residential village but maybe they've sorted that out by now. On the plus side, the lack of booze and low food prices meant you could go and eat to your hearts content knowing it wasn't going to end up costing much. Seriously exquisite homemade pasta with delicious things like rabbit and duck. And amazing cakes.    Canton Cafe  Kingsland The best Chinese in town. Authentic food and BYO booze always makes for fun.   Kalaloo  Kingsland I love this place: it's tiny and makes excellent gourmet pizza with some strange shit on it of you want. It's also good for drinking but don't go with a big crowd unless you book the one big table. Taking out is a good option.   Brazil/Verona  K Rd These are down the street from each other and totally independent but fill the same kind of niche. Slightly alternative and dingy with good music, healthy food and strong coffee.     Rice  The decor of this place would be cool if they could afford to change it every couple of months. But it's a little daft to have for keeps and I think the place has a few other flaws besides. The food is adventurous and some is excellent but the Rice thing is a little weird: you can basically order a side of white, brown or sticky if you want, and that's about as far as it goes. It's a popular place for corporates to do lunch so go figure.    Paramount  Lorne St Fine dining in the city. Capable of putting good cocktails and champagne in your glass and the usual elegant fare on your plate. I wouldn't hurry there but I wouldn't avoid it either.   Gloria  Shortland St The best cafe in town for breakfast and lunch. There's a variety of seating options and a good selection of magazines. It's perfect if you're idle in the city.   Food Alley  Albert St Large selection of cheap, authentic, mostly Asian food. Perfect if you're hungry in the city.

      In the mid-90s I got totally caught up in the Brit Pop wars and the Jungle Movement, so much so that I left for London a few days after my 18th birthday in '98 armed with 2000 pounds of my Grandmother's inheritance money and not a lot else. I have an aunt who lives an hour north of London but felt it was rather ridiculous to cross the world only to stay in the suburbs, so I didn't. Instead I bought a Mixmag and checked out where best to position myself for the night. As it happened it was a Tuesday and there weren't any parties I was desperate to attend so I stayed in Kensington. The following day I relocated to Brixton and stayed there for 2 weeks until my money and confidence were almost depleted. I then lived in Bristol for 9 months and Manchester for 6.    The Velvet Rooms  London  Home to Fabio's dnb party Swerve on a Wednesday night. At that time I seem to recall it being kitted out with kitsch velvet dripping from the ceiling and covering the booths and odd tubes of bubbling water lit in blue and red. I went way too early and got drinking with the bar staff and was actually offered a porter job, but declined on the grounds I would have to work when I was supposed to be partying. The music was naturally brilliant and the crowd was cool with a lot of the Headz hanging out, including Kemistry and Storm. I ended up talking to one young star and he gave me a mixtape and we arranged to meet for lunch the next day. However he then got drunk and proposed we hook up that night instead. It was a disaster. The hotel was super expensive and he passed out after vomiting in the bath. Not very rock n roll at all. I felt so bad in the morning I offered to pay him back for the hotel and the boy had the cheek to accept! Anyway, I went back to the Velvet Rooms two years ago and they had modernised the decor, which is a bit of a shame, but the party was still solid.    Bar Rhumba  London  Home of Bryan G's Movement sessions. The party was being hyped all over the world at the time so I was very surprised to find myself in such a small bar when I arrived early one Thursday evening, but got drinking with&nbsp;a Jamaican man playing records in a corner. As it turned out, they shift some walls or curtains or something and the bar opens up into a bigger club space with a proper DJ booth and some serious sound. Top notch crazy ass shenanigans ensued. Bar Rhumba was also host to Kenny Hawkes' premier Wednesday night house party Space,&nbsp;though I was too preoccupied with dnb to have known about it at the time.    The End  London  This club made me feel like I was truly in London, one of the coolest cities in the world. It's modern and professional with staff giving out snacks to the queue and a lollipop lady in the loos. I went to hear Grooverider play in the lounge but ended up being mesmerised by Darren Emerson in the space-age main room. A definitive night out.    Mass  London  Another impressive club with excellent design. The dancefloor wraps around the DJ area like a stage and a mezzanine bar overlooks it. There's a separate room that's equally made for partying - not just chilling - and on the night I was there it had a vibe of its own. Being in the heart of Brixton, the best thing about Mass was the fashion: baggy, fishnet tights looked hot on some of the mamas shaking their ass on the dancefloor.    333  London  Though hip, this place is really down-to-Earth and kind of gritty. It occupies a few floors of an old building and the music policy is eclectic; whether you've heard of the acts or not you know they're going to be well underground and solidly good. The thing I remember most is the big airline seats they had in one of the lounges but I think there were lots of choice details about the venue.    Fabric  London Fabric must be one of the most famous clubs in the world and for good reason: the club itself is well designed with several spatial options, they&nbsp;take&nbsp;sound seriously and they consistently book&nbsp;the world's best&nbsp;underground electronic artists to do their thing. One night of the weekend tends more toward drum n bass and&nbsp;the other&nbsp;to house, while one room is more geared toward DJs and the other to live performance; hence both the Fabric and Fabric Live CD series. I went one night with a couple of fun men and thoroughly&nbsp;enjoyed myself.   Thekla  Bristol  This is a big old boat sitting on the river at the bottom of town. There was a crazy lounge that served Pot Noodle on the top floor, with windows looking&nbsp;down onto the street on one side and the water on the other. The downstairs galley had been gutted to make way for a sizeable, dark, dirty dancefloor. Many of the dnb greats played there on a regular basis.    Lakota  Bristol  Unfortunately&nbsp;Lakota was often shut for various reasons, possibly legal or financial, but when it was open it was a proper, grey, industrial-style venue. The DJ booth was built back into the wall well above the dancefloor so you could feel a little detached from the source but there was a balcony that went round the other side of the room, from which you could figure out who was playing. Most people didn't seem to mind though and all kinds of showy moves were pulled on the floor. The place was kind of image conscious, but in a good way.    Sankey's Soap  Manchester  One of my favorite clubs ever.&nbsp;The sunken dancefloor,&nbsp;quality DJs, superior sound and&nbsp; hedonistic crowd all make for&nbsp;a perfect night out. Greg Vickers usually hosts Tribal Sessions on a Friday night but&nbsp;he had to&nbsp;go abroad the weekend I was there&nbsp;so&nbsp;the session&nbsp;was&nbsp;switched&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Saturday and&nbsp;it had the same vibe&nbsp;as when a celebrated&nbsp;international&nbsp;gives a rare performance;&nbsp;his following is that&nbsp;loyal and strong.&nbsp;Vickers plays dope&nbsp;dirty grooves and he had an excellent CD on the cover of Mixmag a while ago that showcased the night. Saturdays are usually home to the Red Light party at which&nbsp;all kinds of EDM luminaries make guest appearances.&nbsp;Sankey's is given an extra edge by the fact it's definitely on the wrong side of the tracks and has intense security, though this is all set to change as the surrounding dereliction is now being converted into student flats.  urlLink http://www.tribalgathering.co.uk    Band on the Wall  Manchester  A small club with great sound and perfect design: there's a small dancefloor in front of a stage, a bar down the side and an upstairs lounge with a balcony so you can check the action below. As the name suggests, The Band hosts a lot of live gigs but it's also the home of the best drum n bass parties in Manchester.    The Roadhouse  Manchester  Like The Band, The Roadhouse hosts plenty of live action and is a really nice little club. Fat City [Rae and Christian et al] have their monthly party there, which is a pretty strong vote of confidence from some well-respected locals.    Music Box   Dirty, dark underground cavern that's built for getting sweaty on the dancefloor. The likes of Mr Scruff play there sometimes and you know the crowd is going to be safe. Next door is Jilly's Rock World - if that's more your kind of thing - and upstairs I believe there might be a little DJ bar for chilling; I found myself in it one night but I can't remember how I got there so it may be on the other side of town for all I know.    Dry Bar / Night'n'Day  Manchester  These bars are right next to each other on Oldham St but they're quite different. Aptly named, the NnD is a cafe by day and an alternative kind of music venue by night. Dry Bar, on the other hand,&nbsp;isn't dry at all: it's got lots of booze.&nbsp;It used to be owned by New Order and featured in the movie 24 Hour Party People in the scene where Sean Ryder holds Tony Wilson&nbsp;to ransom&nbsp;with the tape of their new material.

      Clubbing in Tokyo is a whole lot of fun. It's not that cheap but nor is a lot of things so don't let that stop you. Some notable details: They have lockers so you can put as much stuff in there as you want and get it when you want, saving the hassel of waiting for coatcheck and then harassing the person later when you've forgotten something. They also often have vending machines so you can buy drinks without going to the bar. They take VJing seriously. The sound is usually awesome. Like clubs everywhere though, they could do with a little more space for their bathrooms. You must show a photo ID at the door, no exceptions. The friendly Iranian guys in Shibuya are a useful source of extra-curricular information&nbsp;and for&nbsp;links to&nbsp;every club visit&nbsp; urlLink http://www.cyberjapan.tv &nbsp;The site&nbsp;gives such delightful tips as "raving clothes isn't authorized inside so leave your glooming sticks at home" and "Dress code: anything expensive!"    Maniac Love  Aoyama  ML is a basement club with a solid soundsystem and a solid following that knows its music. Some of the great DJs of the world have spun there and they host a long-running techno party on Saturday nights as well as throwing a good afterhours party on Sat and Sun mornings that only costs 1000 yen after 5am. The dancefloor is on the level at which you enter the club and then there's a bar upstairs with a balcony overlooking the action below. So everything's in one small room with a fairly low roof and it's sweaty and smokey and not at all suitable for prissy posers.    Hachi  Aoyama  This place is so fucking Japanese, which naturally means it's very cool. Dirty in the best possible way with eccentric men grilling chicken in the first floor bar and different styles of music on the other 3 levels; Eight is essential experiencing. And, yes, my English is kind of being affected by living in this country. The best part about the club for me, considering my obsession with cityscapes, is the fact that it's located right by a huge highway junction so you can't for a moment forget you're in one of the world's great megalopolises. I went there on a Tuesday when only the first 3 floors were open but I can't wait to go back for a proper party and more shochu and yakitori. Triple wicked shit.    Yellow  Nishiabizu  One of the most established underground venues in Tokyo, Yellow is a must for anyone serious about EDM. It hosts many of the major players on the international circuit from all genres, like Carl Craig, Mark Farina, and Goldie. I don't know anything about sound gear but the set-up in the DJ area looks impressive with an array of machines all stashed behind metal caging. The dancefloor is the perfect size, with a huge pillar in the center to break things up a little and some bins at the back to sit on. Adjacent to it is the main bar/socialising area, which is still dark like the dancefloor. Upstairs (either round the stairs by the entrance or up the huge stairway on the other side of the dancefloor) is another brighter bar that's quite lovely. There are also a couple of spacious booths that can be separated by curtains and made VIP. Through a door is another dark small chill zone that overlooks the back of the dancefloor though many people just hang out on the stairs. Sometimes the whole club hears the main DJ, other times they have another DJ play in the upstairs lounge. By the way, you'll need a map to find it and the only signage is a yellow, neon thing with no writing.    Air  Daikanyama  This club is literally very underground, like a couple of floors. The dancefloor at the bottom is big and dark with some nice booths down a separate corridor and a standing kind of chill area at the back. Upstairs is a balcony corridor overlooking the floor, plus an alternative DJ booth. In a separate room there's a bright lounge where many pretty young things take time out to listen to another DJs tunes.    Loop  Shibuya  A small club with an intimate vibe and some quality residents as well as visiting internationals. It's got good sound, two funny little seating areas and they sometimes give away excellent promo CDs of their resident DJs, who are the best in Tokyo. Loop is the type of place that attracts people who are informed about music and want a guaranteed good night out with some close buddies.    Module  Shibuya  Home to some very enthusiastic music types who push the musical boundaries in many welcome directions. Upstairs is a nice lounge space with a spacious bar, plus another small kind of cute room. Downstairs is the self-contained dancefloor, which may be a good or bad thing. It means you don't have loads of people standing around with drinks but it also means if you want to get a drink or sit down you have to leave the room. However the sound can be fed to one or both rooms upstairs, depending on whether they've got other DJs booked to play.    La Fabrique  Shibuya  A restaurant by day and a club by night, La Fabrique is all about Fooding, which is food + feeling/clubbing. It has a parent branch in Paris and as such is suitably stylish. The food is good and a DJ plays in a high booth at low volume while you eat. They then gradually clear the tables and turn up the sound until the dancefloor's jumping. Sometimes they set the DJ up in one of the slightly raised areas to one side of the dancefloor, below the spacious balcony lounge upstairs. On the opposite side of the floor is an enormous screen for definitely eyecatching images.    Nuts  Shibuya  Nuts is Nuts, like crazy/mental/mad. From left to right you have a corridor with unseen steps and sitting people, then a dancefloor with the DJs at the front and the sound engineers at the back. In the middle is a stage that you must clamber over to get to the bathrooms at the back, or use the corridor at your peril. Next is a room with the bar in the center and two seated areas at either end. The wall between the bar part and dancefloor is a one-way mirror. The roof above it is normal height but it's very low at the ends so that there can be 2 upstairs lounges; one private, one public. Both spaces are tiny but the open one is equipped for a DJ. Nuts specialises in underground urban beats of every description.    Womb  Shibuya  It's easy to understand why they named the club as they did because the mainroom is dark and deep with a roof that's three floors high. The DJ is situated on a large stage with a platform in front of it and a big screen on the wall behind. You really need to be in the centerof the dancefloor to appreciate the Phazon soundsystem, though the lighting and visuals are impressive from any standpoint. At the back of the room there's a seated recharge area in one corner and a bar in the other. A large staircase takes you up to the second and third floor bars that both have windows overlooking the dancefloor and a reserved area on the far side. Apart from that they're very different. The second floor  is linked to the main soundsystem and is a dark lounge with some tables, chairs and sofas. The third floor could almost be a separate club with a DJ usually spinning a different genre from the mainroom and some space to dance. It's also very beautiful. Womb has a very utilitarian feel and is efficiently operated. There is another attractive, spacious lounge down some stairs when you first enter and a long corridor of lockers that lead the way into the club proper. It boasts Tokyo's biggest mirrorball and is the natural place for serious talent to show what they're capable of and serious clubbers to strut their stuff. However, several of my Tokyoite friends claim the soundsystem lacks volume and clarity.

      I can hardly speak Japanese and I can't read Kanji at all so eating out is sometimes a bit of a challenge, especially because many of the restaurants specialise in something but I can't necessarily figure out what. It's true that many people still eat rice with every meal but bread and pasta is rapidly becoming a dietary fixture, for better or worse. I rarely get to eat fresh fish lightly fried as I'm used to in NZ; it's usually raw, oily or deep fried. They have a vast selection of vegetables but corriander and other herbs seem to be quite rare. The fruit is expensive and a little average. They make good cake.       Particular Restaurants:    Fujikawa Steak Houses  Shimobe Onsen, Yamanashi This is my local restaurant and it's world class. The ambience is serene and the food exquisite. They take real delight in cooking it and the small courses just keep on rolling out: simple vegetable starters, sashimi, fried crumbed salmon, melting beef, fried garlic rice, fruit... And that's only a basic option. They also serve draft Asahi and have an extensive selection of whiskey.    Tokyo Nobu  Aoyama Robert De Niro owns the chain and I suspect he's making a killing from it. The restaurant was lovely in a dated sort of way and the service was impeccable but the prices were outrageous. I went there with a charming man who ended up paying for everything, making me wish we'd just gone to one of the many excellent sushi bars around Tokyo instead of this famous institution. It was about 2000 yen for few slices of yellow fin with jalapeno peppers and a sweet sauce, 10 000 for a chunk of beef in wasabi sauce and 700 for a single tenpured scallop. But it was fucking delicious and we got drunk and I nearly fell over every time I tried to negotiate the rickety floor.     Sawadee  Shibuya Addresses are useless in this country so I'll just say it's a five-minute walk down the main road to the left of Shibuya station from the Hachiko exit, and it's downstairs. I love this place. They make fantastic authentic Thai food, the service is excellent and the space is all quirky and wonderful: providing a relaxing escape from the chaos of the streets above.     Elephant  Shibuya This place is in the building just behind 109, which you can't miss if you walk out of the station and veer left. It's up an elevator and it's huge and dark with Buddhist trappings and pan-Asian cuisine. Great for a big group of people; Elephant is Tokyo style with a difference.   La Fabrique  Shibuya In the basement of the Zerogate building by Seibu, La Fab is a nightclub at night (funnily enough) and a quality restaurant by day/evening. The food is French-influenced and basically what that means is that it's not all fish and noodles and chicken and rice, if you're fancying a break from that kind of fare. Portions are dainty but the prices are reasonable and it has a lovely ambience with hip, attractive staff attending to your every need. They also do Moet by the glass, which is nice.    Restaurant Types:    Ramen Shops  Ramen is your average instant-type noodle from China. They will come in a variety of tasty broths and sometimes have a few strange vegetables or some thin meat floating on top. The shops are often small, simple and cheap.    Soba Restaurants  You're able to get soba at many places but the specialist restaurants are often really nice. Usually it will be served cold on a little bamboo mat thing and you dip it into hot or cold soup. Traditional accompaniments include tenpura, sashimi and pickles. NB: I don't know if you can get yaki-soba (fried noodles) at traditional soba restaurants but they're very tasty.   Gyu-don  Many of these are chain stores and they basically serve fairly low-grade beef on top of rice, with a few strange variations. Often you can also get the beef soaked in some mild artificial curry sauce.   Yaki-tori shops  Basically sell fried chicken on skewers though obviously they'll have some other kind of snacks too. Sometimes they are really small with standing space only, kind of like a better version of a hotdog stall.   Yaki-Niku  Korean bbq beef reaturants. They have grills built into the table or put a portable one out for you and you roast your own beef and vegetables. The meat is either fatty or lean, and in Japan they prefer the fat. It's either eaten by itself or with rice or wrapped in lettuce with pickles and miso paste. You can also eat tongue or other parts of the animals and they have an oddly delicious dish of raw beef, raw egg yolk and crisp apple. Putting garlic cloves on the grill in a little foil with butter is also a good idea.   Izakayas  Traditional Japanese public houses that are popular for drinking and de-stressing after work, though apparently this has declined throughout the recession. They'll usually sell famous things like soba and udon noodles, tenpura and sashimi. They will often have a local or seasonal speciality too, like a big pot full of stuff that you boil yourself. Some Izakayas are beautiful and traditional, others are strange and old fashioned, others are hip and modern. The bigger ones may have chairs and tables as well as tatami mat seating; the smaller ones are usually tatami only except for the space round the bar.   Sushi Restaurants  As well as quality sushi, these places often serve every variation on the seafood theme. There will be many kinds of fish (sakana) plus scallops, crab (kani), shellfish, squid (ika) and octopus (taco). It may be fried, raw, oiled, cured or whatever. Sometimes delicious, sometimes not. Often the shops themselves are very delighful, though you can also buy sushi at big places where it goes round on conveyor belts and you just grab plates and count them at the end. This sushi is usually a little average.   Family Restaurants  These are often 24 hour places that attract all kinds of people, from drunk salarymen to wasted clubbers. You can get sashimi or tenpura, curry shit with rice, shrimp spaghetti with seaweed on top instead of parmesan or bizarre toasted sandwiches with lettuce in them. Be warned that in NZ they would never dream of serving sashimi that isn't 100% fresh because it's still a little uncommon. But in Japan you may encounter slightly smelly, chewy raw fish, which aint cool at all. I'd recommend you just get Potato Fry, which is your average serving of fries.     Foreign Food  There are some really good Indian, Thai and Italian places in Japan but you need to be choosy because some of them are awful bastardisations.

      SF has been a major player in the global music scene for years and years and is now home to many of the best deep house DJ/producers in the EDM movement. Some people argue that deep house isn't actually a category of house in itself but rather is the absense of any other distinction, like hard or handbag or progressive or tribal or whatever. But I think deep house is actually kinda deep. It means the music is going to have soul and rhythm and quirky details and maybe some vocals, maybe not. It doesn't mean it's going to be boring wall paper music; it can still be ballsy and a little dark and definitely funky. So I basically went to San Franciso to check out how the music of people like Mark Farina and Joshua sounds on its home ground. I was surprised to find that the breaks phenomenon is just as big as everywhere else and also that a lot of the music was kind of edgier than you would expect in such a sunny little town. But then, as someone said, that was probably a reflection on where I went.  Venues can only serve alcohol till 2am but they are currently pushing to extend this to 4am. Some clubs stay open till that hour already but just shut the bar. Because of this, there is a massive private afterhours culture so if you're in the know you'll end up in some hip loft. If you're not, you'll end up walking the streets. The entrance age is 21 and everyone who looks under about 30 will be ID'd. Some clubs check thoroughly for drugs, others don't at all. Some make it difficult to do drugs by having low or colored lighting or a lack of surfaces in the cubicles etc. In the US now, the owners or promoters of a gig can be fined a lot of money or imprisoned for a long time if people are found to be using drugs on their premises and it seems like they tolerate it. The law was called the RAVE Act - Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstacy - but has been renamed the Illicit Drugs Anti Proliferation Act so that it doesn't seem to be targeting nightclubs in particular, but all public entertainment venues. Originally, the sale of water and the presence of a chill-out room was construed as being evidence of blatant drug use. In other words, it's serious shit so be sensible and don't jeopardise people's livelihoods.  Although there are a number of big venues still in operation there are many more smaller venues appropriately called DJ bars. These usually have a lot of seating, a little dancefloor and a good sound system. Apparently they're the place to find the music lovers not just the party animals. I got distracted and didn't get round half as many places as I would have liked but you can get an idea of the scope from the ones below. For a totally comprehensive guide go to www.sfstation.com   Club 6  (6th St) This was probably my favorite club. I went there on both Friday and Saturday nights to hear East Coast Boogiemen and go to the Get Underground party, which featured some of the local tech-type heroes like Hector Morales. The club has a street-level lounge but the tunes were so good in the basement I didn't spend any time there. The sound system was awesome and there was a rather relaxed attitude to the smoking laws which gave it a grittier feel than other venues. Downstairs, the DJ area is at one end and then the room goes way back with pillars marking the main dancespace. On the right is the bar with areas either side of it for chilling. Down the left are more seats and several phat, phat, phat subs. At the very back of the room is a semi-separate lounge. Behind the left hand wall (under the stairs) is another lounge space with some modern art and dim lighting. The club is a serious venue for people who want to check the music rather than trot about being seen. On both nights I was there the music was fucking great - I swear I didn't hear a single bad or played out tune. The staff were really friendly and the crowd was cool.     The End Up  (6th St) I went here on the Thursday night to a party called Kit Kat, and on Sunday to a day party called T-Power. Kit Kat is home to a rotating bunch of SFs finest and T-Power is obviously a little crazy because most people have come straight from their Saturday party or only snatched a couple of hours sleep. Having said that, the club is not all about mindless hedonism at all. The music is classy and there are so many nooks and crannies that it caters for all tastes and purposes, though the entire place is linked to the same soundsystem and DJ action. After getting past the ID check, drug search and door payment you find yourself behind the oval shaped bar. Round the other side, up a few steps, is the dancefloor. The far wall is all glass doors leading outside but the central portions are shut to create an enclosed dance space. At either end you can go out onto a sprawling outdoor patio/garden type area with lots of plants and a little waterfall in the corner, plus a separate little balcony up some stairs. Inside at the back of the venue is a big space which has a pool table and some video games, a sunken area centered around a fake fire, and some seating that goes up into the corners like a little stadium. They stop serving alochol at 2am on Saturday night, close at 4 then re-open at 6, at which time they can start serving again. You have to pay each time a different party begins but if you're there all day Sunday you only pay $5 to stay on at Devotion, another one of the city's credible house parties. Basically, it's a total institution and they know how to throw a good party with experienced clubbers in mind.    Arrow Bar  (6th St) There are so many bars in San Francisco that I'm sure everyone would be able to find one that suits them exactly but Arrow seems to have a disproportionate number of loyal patrons, especially on Wednesday nights. The night I was there people were playing rock n roll and The Rapture dropped by to spin a late set before their gig the following night. I got a little confused about what's normally on because I kept finding conflicting flyers but I think Wednesdays are often about acid and early ninties type house. It's a dark, cool little cavern great for talking to friends, making new ones or just sitting back, drinking and listening to the music.      Anu  (6th St) Almost directly across the road from Arrow, Anu is an altogether more modern, airy, upmarket affair and definitely falls into the DJ bar category with a great little soundsystem and small dancefloor catering for people who prefer micro-clubbing. They have an extensive selection of excellent vodka and indeed the crowd seemed like they'd be top-shelf drinkers although there wasn't a hint of snobbery in the air. It seems everywhere you go in SF you'll still find an eclectic mix of freaks and fashionistas.   111 Minna  (Downtown) By day, this place is a very modern art gallery. It occupies the kind of large warehouse type space that hipsters would dream to live in but, in SF expecially, could never afford. The art varied from post-whatever lesbian-goth surrealism to bold abstracts. I was particularly stunned by this fine black and white sketch of a fairy girl spitting blood and teeth with a caption asking something like "how much is too much?", in reference to Americans' apparent obsession with bleaching their teeth. L-shaped, there is a small bar in the corner and another along one of the arms. On Wednesdays, DJs Spesh and Jondi (maybe) host a party called Qool which kicks off at 5 and goes till 10, with DJs playing a short 45 minute set each. The line up is projected onto the side wall of the half of the L where all the dancing happens. Other visuals are projected onto the far wall and onto a transparent screen that cuts the hardcore dancers off from the mere foot tappers. In the other part of the L people drink and talk very noisily abou their day. The crowd was a mix of post-work businessman, idle artists and everyone in between. The tunes were banging from the start with breaks and progressive house featuring prominently and a handful of punters dominating proceedings with their wild and wacky ways (ha ha ha) on the stage that surrounds the DJ booth. In my opinion, Qool is a fantastic testament to the fact that people love to dance, drugs or no drugs, anytime, anyplace. It would be difficult to argue that all these people are E-happy ravers who don't care about the music. It's just a great mid-week meeting ground for people wanting to rock it in a TAZ (Temporary Autonomous Zone) right in the commercial center of the city.         Pink  (16th St) Apparently this bar used to be Liquid and was one of the fixtures on the nitelife circuit. Now it is a fairly posh little bar with these great big white cushions along one wall, raised far enough off the ground that your feet dangle when you sit back in them. Light (silk?) screens divide the space. At the far end is the DJ booth and a small dancefloor. At the other end is a little lounge space. There are many beautiful details about the place and in the restrooms someone has written "you are so beautiful" on the ornate mirror. Maybe this is a reflection of the fact that everyone who goes there is expected to be attractive. More likely it's a reference to the whole everyone is beautiful within thing. Whatever, it's a smart place to get a drink and on Sundays it's now home to Bionic: a long-standing deep house night that used to be at The Top.    Mezzanine  (Jesse St, between 5th and 6th) To me this was more of a venue than a club; kind of like a gentrified version of an illicit rave space. It's big and loud with one huge room downstairs and several "mezzanine" lounges. I think the experience would be totally dependent on the music policy that night though the club may have a following of its own, I don't know.   Milk  (Upper Haight St) On the clubbier end of the DJ bar cline, Milk has a lot of lovely seated space down one end and a decent-sized dancefloor with a loud soundsystem down the other. I went on a Monday night when Green Gorilla Lounge have their party High Heels. Drinks were cheap, the music was excellent, staff were friendly and a good time was generally had by all.     Ruby Skye  (Powell St, Downtown) Nominated by Dancestar as one of the top five clubs in America, Ruby Skye is a grand club but not very engaging. I went along to hear Doc Martin so it was easy enough to shut out the dodgy bits and get lost in the tunes but if you went on a night when the music wasn't up your street you could have a fairly shocking time. This place is all about the money. If you want to dance that's fine but if you don't your options are limited to either paying for a private space down the sides of the upstairs balcony or knowing someone so you can get into the lovely VIP space at the back of the dancefloor. Or you could be a VVIP and get into the enclosed lounge in the top right hand corner of the room, where people look to be in a glass cage that's totally removed from the party. Another option is to go into the upstairs lounge, behind the main bar, where they've managed to get around the smoking ban by claiming it to be a cigar room and adorning the walls with said objects. But the R&B is so bad you probably won't want to stay long. Also, in theory, everyone should be beautiful at a place like this but they weren't. Luckily I was there with a few cool, connected peepz and we got wasted and messed around in the VIP, doing our best not to laugh at the pro chicks dancing on podiums in fishnets and Mexican ponchos.     DNA, Mighty, The Top, Cloud 9, 1015 Folsom  Unfortunately I didn't get to any of these places but the first four are home to some of the best parties in town. DNA has remedy on a Friday and The Top is an institution that serves up great beats all week long. Mighty is another arty space by day and features a Richard Long sound system that is apparently mighty fucking loud. Cloud 9 is sometimes home to a party called Sleaze Please so it can't be bad. 1015 has encountered serious problems under the new legislation and is apparently totally gross but it's the place to go if you're a pill popping raver who likes Paul Van Dyke.

      I've decided to quit teaching and take up bartending when I go home and so I asked my dad to send me a cocktail book. But I've taken the liberty of simplifying things and inventing some of my own recipes, and have abbreviated everything. It'll be an amateur guide with a heavy bias toward vodka and famous drinks named after cities or people.   The numbers are intended as a general millilitre guide only; more for the purpose of gauging proportions than exactly measuring out the ingredients. The basic techniques are shaking and stirring, straining and pouring, building, and "putting". When you shake or stir then there will be ice in the shaker; if you strain you keep the ice out of the drink and if you pour you let the ice go in. At a bar they might use crushed ice for one drink and cubed ice for another but at home just use what you've got. When you build a drink then there will be ice in the glass and you just place one ingredient on top of the other: cheapest to most expensive spirit, usually, followed by the mix if there is one. Putting is exactly that. There is also blending, which involves a blender; and floating, which involves floating. Every home should at least have highball glasses (HBG) and/or old-fashioned glasses (OFG). If that's all you've got then just remember the stronger the drink the smaller the glass. Ideally you would also have some cocktail glasses (CTG) and champagne flutes (CPF), though I doubt many homes would have champagne saucers (CPS) or brandy balloon glasses (BBG). As most of the list will be cocktails, that is the glass you should use unless otherwise stated.      I will post a long list as soon as I get email at home and can send it from my laptop. For now, here are two of my favorite cocktails:    Chocolate Martini   Vodka                        60                   White Creme de Cacao         30   Shake and strain, serve with Hershey's Kiss   NB: Just because it's got chocolate in the title doesn't mean it's got to be brown, and certainly doesn't mean it should contain various creamy liqueurs like Bailey's. It's a martini, not a milkshake.   French Daiquiri  White rum 45 Cassis 30 Gomme 15 Lime juice 30 Mint   Crush M into LJ, shake with WR-G, strain

      This is in no way a list of recommendations. Some people have no interest in fucking with their mind and body and that's a great thing. Other people respond well to some drugs and react badly to others. I sometimes wonder what sort of person I'd be if I'd never tried anything; all&nbsp;I know is that I've had some very good times and some very bad times. For comprehensive information about all and sundry, check&nbsp; urlLink http://www.drugabuse.gov  for the official line or  urlLink http://www.drugabuse.com &nbsp;for a more colloquial approach.    Alcohol  (ethyl alcohol, ethanol)  Funnily enough, alcohol is the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages.It is the most commonly used drug in the world and in some situations it's difficult not to partake in its consumption. Percentages range from around 5 for beer to 12 for wine to 40 for spirits. The highest percentage may be found in Absinthe, which is heated with sugar in a spoon in a fashion that resembles the process by which heroin is liquified so it can be injected. In other words, it's a serious drink. All kinds of alcohol are made from fruit or vegetables or grains and have been produced by man since the dawn of time. The first time I got drunk I was 12 and it was with my friend at my house while we were babysitting. She made some nasty concoctions and I drank them. I don't remember what happened after that but I woke up black and blue the next morning and feeling like hell. My mother had had to force me into the shower with the aid of a spatula, I think, but I don't think I was taken to hospital. I drank a little throughout the following year but didn't start regularly drinking till I was 14. Since then it has been a constant problem. It's easy for me to not drink at all but sometimes it's difficult for me to stop once I've started, and the consequences have been disastrous. Most people will know at least a few bad drunks or have had a few bad experiences of their own so I shall only say that I've done most nasty, humiliating, disgusting, rude things imaginable as a direct consequence of drinking alcohol, and suffered some appalling hangovers. I've also had plenty of hilarious, crazy, charming moments, which is why I'll never give it up altogether.    Amitriptyline  (amitrip = depressant)  Like most anti-depressants, Amitrip interferes with the neurotransmitters in your brain that affect your moods. But unlike stimulants that allegedly release more of stuff like dopamine - making you feel temporarily happy and pleased with yourself - anti-depresssants interfere with the natural communication between your neuro things and slow your brain so that you stop going up and down and flatten right out. I checked a bunch of websites for information and some of them said they don't really know how it all works, just that it does. One of the outside dangers of regularly using depressants is that if you come off them suddenly your brain may literally jump back to life - resulting in seizures. Nice. I don't sleep well and Amitrip also has a fairly strong sedative effect so my doctor put me on a low dose of it and then I asked if I could gradually increase the dose until I was taking the amount where it starts to work as an anti-dpressant - about 75mg. However it didn't really put me to sleep that well and as I took stronger pills I started to really feel the presence of an artificial substance in my body, particularly a metallic kind of taste in my mouth, so I took myself off it again. I wasn't clinically depressed at the time; I was just partying too much and not sleeping enough and generally making life hard for myself. I think I did feel a little happier when I hit the highest dose but it was a fake feeling and I also noticed that it made me feel double shit after taking anything else. So that was the end of that.    Amyl  (Amyl Nitrate/Butrate: Rush, Poppers = solvent)  This drug is really about as classy as sniffing glue or petrol but is much more socially acceptable. You can buy it legally in sex shops, usually with lables that claim it's CD cleaner, or room freshener or leather cleaner or soemthing equally bizarre. If you are 100% straight and a straight sort of person then this probably isn't the drug for you. But if you're already wasted and/or a bent kind of person then it may come in handy. It makes everything very intense and funny for a very short time, but after you still kind of remember where it took you. Like music sounds mad. It's popular with gay men because it loosens the arse but it also makes human relationships feel generally intense so it's handy in bed even if you're not planning on doing it anal. Be warned, it's very bad for your brain and may give you a headache at the time of use or after.    Cannabis  (marijuana, pot, weed, grass, ganja)  Many countries have some kind of special allowance for pot in their drug legislation because it is so widely used and the medicinal properties are manifold. But I don't think it's particularly good at motivating people, especially teenagers, and should be avoided until a person has a reasonable understanding of what life's all about. Smoking the odd lightweight spliff won't harm a kid very much but highgrade hydroponic skunk can seriously fuck with your mind, and some of the THC (Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) levels are seriously high these days. I started smoking all forms fairly regularly when I was 14 and for a while it was always fun; but then there would be times when I would feel paranoid - as is commonly claimed - and just plain uncomfortable and self-conscious. It always made listening to music a very enjoyable experience but after I had a strange experience on acid things would sometimes turn unpleasantly intense and I'd no longer be fit for social events. In case you don't know, marijuana is most often smoked in papers like a cigarette (straight or with some tabacco), or in a small pipe or bong (big pipe with water). It's called a Philly Blunt when you combine the good stuff with a cigar (delicious). The flavor and toxicity of buds varies hugely and cannabis can also be made into hash and oil.    Cocaine  (coke, charlie, blow = anesthetic stimulant)  This drug has been around for ever and I'm sure everyone's heard of it, if not tried it. The high doesn't last too long so you have to keep doing it to sustain the buzz, causing your tolerance level to grow ever higher. One of the most obvious problems of drugs is that regular use is expensive and unfortunately it's often the people who can afford it least that end up addicted. Basically coke makes you feel good without altering your mind too drastically, so you can still operate fairly normally. If it's good coke (meaning it hasn't been cut to smithereens with stuff like baby laxative) it will make your nose or gums, or even your whole face, feel numb. This is because of it's dual function as an anesthetic.    Codeine  (opioid = painkiller)  This is a solid drug. It's not as hardcore as some of the other opioids and is still available over the counter in some countries, though not straight. But like all painkillers, there is a risk of developing physical dependency. I used to ride horses and fall off quite often and hurt my back so I was first given it when I was about 15. It's useful for most physical discomfort.    Crack  (freebase cocaine = stimulant)  People wanting something more hardcore than coke used to use ether to remove the hydrochloride to get a smokeable form known as free base. But it's kind of dangerous and difficult so they started doing it with sodium bicarbonate instead and the trend caught on big time. Cocaine still enjoys a fairly glamourous reputation while crack is considered to be fairly disgraceful. It's quite expensive but is prevalent on the streets of cities all over the world and because you smoke it (rather than snort it like coke) it means more gets to your brain faster. It tastes like plastic and makes you feel shit hot for a little while because it fucks with your uptake of dopamine: the neurotransmitter that's "released as part of the brain's reward system". But then you just feel plain shit. I've only tried it because various people offered me a smoke and I assumed they meant pot so I accepted. And yes, I probably could have backed out once it became apparent that this was not the case - but I didn't. Proceed with caution if you ever get involved.    Crystal Meth  (methamphetamine hydrochloride: ice, P, crank = stimulant)  Nasty, nasty, nasty. The effects are said to be similar to cocaine but much longer lasting. It causes your brain to release vast quantities of dopamine so you feel extra good. You'll also be able to drink and dance all night and if you only do this occasionally you'll probably not suffer much damage; however, people that use it often turn into assholes. Ephedrine does occur naturally in some kind of plant but it's worth remembering that crystal meth is 100% manufactured by man. It's a big problem in Japan, Hawaii and Auckland, where psuedoephedrine-based products like Sudafed are now restricted.    E  (MDMA + ? : Ecstasy, X, disco biscuits = psychedelic stimulant)  E is the drug of choice for many young ravers but people often seem to grow out of it between the ages of 25 and 30, so the authorities should just quit worrying about it and focus on drugs that lead to debillitating lifetime addictions: alcohol, heroin and bad television. Like acid, I think the reason people go off it is that the initial effects and insights become mundane and even annoying after a while. In the beginning it's fabulous hearing the music differently and relating to people better and feeling good about what you're wearing and how you're dancing and what you're doing with your life and where you're going and why you're doing something and who you're with etc etc. And if you're not in a club it's nice chilling with people and seeing life for the beautiful thing it is without the degree of paranoia and fear that most of us harbor somewhere in our consciousness. However it's usually really obvious when someone's on E and it can be a bit of a joke because, the fact is, it's just not real. So if you're wanting escapism - or just a little reality enhancement - it's fucking ideal. But if you're wanting to dance and talk with your mates without outside interference then it's going to get in the way sooner or later. Of course the jury's still out on the longterm effects but everyone knows they're going to die so it's up to the individual what they do or don't do to affect the life you have before that event. What really matters is the short term effects and most people will agree that the occasional pill doesn't make you feel too bad at all, while taking several a few nights a week will generally deplete your body's resources and make you feel low - physically and mentally. A final point to make about E: unless you get them tested, you won't know what's in them. And the maufacturers are very imaginative people. In some cases you'll get one of MDMA's cousins - MDA or MDEA, which are more chill - other times you'll get smack (often the cause of the nauseaous vibe people get - makes you want more too) or speed, or even something totally innocuous like aspirin.    G  (gamma-hydroxybutyrate: GBH, liquid E = solvent)  G works by reducing the amount of oxygen that gets to your brain, which is why people often faint when they're on it. It's easy to OD because the drug has an exponential effect meaning that twice the dose doesn't equal twice the high but loads more the high, if you get what I mean. It's also easy to spike people's drinks with it, which sucks, and if you use it improperly you will indeed inflict Grievous Bodily Harm upon yourself. If taken sensibly it'll just make you feel like you've had a few drinks and dropped a good E.    Halcion  (triazolam: a benzodiazepine = depressant)  The world's most widely prescribed sedative. It's short-acting and has few uses besides putting you to sleep, which it's very good at.    Heroin  (diacetylmorphine: smack, junk = opioid)  H was first synthesised from morphine in 1874 and since then it's caused a world of problems. I've never tried it but apparently it's very nice, which is why so many people want it again and again and again. This can cause severe financial problems (so people get desperate and turn to cliche things like crime and prostitution) or it can easily lead to death as people take more to try and regain the inital high, which decreases with use. Unlike some other drugs, it is totally physically addictive as well as psychologically addictive. The symptoms of physical withdrawal have been well-documented in books like  Trainspotting ; I have only had close experience with a couple of addicts but, based on that, I would surmise that once you've overcome the physical disorder you're then left with a fairly large hole in your life that is difficult - if not impossible - to ever fill. Because using heroin seems to take up a lot of time. First you've got to find it, or find the money to get it, then you've got to cook it up and inject it (or snort it, as is more popular in fashionable circles where syringes aren't cool), then you've got to sit around for hours dozing and dribbling and talking shit. The strangest thing about people when they're on it is that they appear to be asleep but they may at any point jerk to life and join in the conversation, or else mumble and hum about various moments in their life. They also have a tendency to drop things like cigarettes and drinks but will still insist upon maintaining ownership of said objects, the way a child may claim to be perfectly capable of taking a doberman for a walk through a park. Many people have tried heroin and liked it and been perfectly capable of leaving it alone so it's a bit inaccurate to claim that it makes addicts of everyone but if you're that way inclined I'd steer clear until you're really old or dying of a terminal illness. All junkies may not have sold their soul to their devil but they certainly appear to have given something important away, if only their ability to ever lead a "normal" life. Some great art has been produced by smackheads but it's not a life I'd choose.    K  (ketamine hydrochloride: Special K = disassociative anesthetic)  Similarly to PCP, this drug taps into some kind of part of your brain that is nothing short of spiritual. It's legally used to tranquilze animals and sometimes it makes you feel tranquil too, other times you get quite energetic. It's best taken sitting down with friends in small amounts (bumps not lines), though it's quite popular in nightclubs too. Sometimes it's not very easy to walk or judge distance and space, and music can sound pretty crazy. You may have an out-of-body type experience. If you use it too much you may turn a little mental and paranoid and unsociable, so don't do that.    LSD  (lysergic acid diethylamide: acid = hallucinogen)  Acid is very exciting the first few times you try it: it takes you to places in your mind you might otherwise never go and presents a version of reality that you might otherwise never see. Sometimes it just makes everything really, really funny. However, if you take it to much you might not come back the same and might even go kind of crazy. I took some particularly strange stuff when I was 16 and it has definitely had a permanent effect on me. It was at an Ed Rush gig at The Box in '97 and I had a total mind/body disassociative experience that resulted in me being taken away by an ambulance. My body was running around being a nuisance: trying to remove the records from the turntables, jumping over taxis, sitting on the road in front of police cars, swimming in fountains - that sort of thing. My mind was occupied with evacuating people from the planet in a consciously-chosen death that meant we all simulataneously left our bodies and went to a dark place where the music was the same as in the club and everyone was chilling in a dope bar and the DJ was really important and I was really important, but first I was really sick and needed a lot of help to be able to do what I had to do and people were really slow to give it, then they finally clicked and off we went. My mind rejoined my body when I was safely ensconced in a hospital bed. I had signed several false names on the clipboard beside me and was having toruble separating the sound of running water from the picture of a waterfall on the wall in front of me. Eventually I managed to run away undetected and had a strange experience with some cows on top of Mt Hobson on my way home. It was a really vivid, graphic and strange trip and I often have flashbacks when I smoke pot or take E in an EDM environment, which doesn't make partying in a normal fashion very easy. So if that's the kind of thing you're after then by all means drop a tab a day; otherwise I recommend you just do it a few times in your late teens and be done with it.    Magic Mushrooms   Like anything, if you eat too many of these too often - or take the wrong ones - you probably won't be in very good shape. But they can be really fun: like acid without the the hours and hours of inane headtripping. I recommend you go to Haad Yao beach on NW Ko Pha Ngan, Thailand, and ask around. Some places do omelettes, others do tea, others do milkshakes - all good.    MDMA  (methylenedioxymethamphetamine = psychedelic stimulant)  Sometimes known as pure E, MDMA is the active ingredient in most E pills. According to drugabuse.gov, it's chemically similar to both methamphetamine and mescaline, which explains a lot I think. Of course MDMA powder may still be cut with something but you're more likely to get the real deal when you buy it like that than you would in an E. And because you snort it rather than swallow it you've got a much better idea of when it's going to affect you and for how long. It's less convenient to use in a club but ideal for home entertaining. However, do consider the usual drug risks wherever you take them: death, nosebleeds, psychological breakdowns etc etc.    Morphine  (principium somniferum = painkiller)  I'm not any good at Latin but I'm assuming the archaic name for morphine means something like "the principal thing that makes you sleep" because morphine is the active ingredient in opium; a fact which was discovered in 1803. This is the hardcore drug that hospitals administer for patients who are in serious pain. It will also induce a floaty kind of high and is sometimes taken recreationally for this purpose, usually in tablet form or in lines of powder. Too much will kill you fairly easily. It's what heroin is made from.    Opium   Opium is the stuff you find naturally in the Poppies that are mostly grown in countries like Afghanistan. If you read this list you'll see that there are a number of painkillers classed as opioids, which means they're all derived from that same little flower. All opioids can lead to dependency and death if used improperly. Opium itself is relatively uncommon in the western world nowadays but it used to be very, very popular and has a long colorful history that spans thousands of years and includes ritualistic and recreational activities, war, science and, eventually, illegalisation. Opium basically just chills you out: you can smoke it like cannabis oil or drink it in tea or whatever. It might have enjoyed a similar status to marijuana if scientists hadn't figured out how to make morphine and then heroin from it, which chill you way the fuck out so you're not kind of here anymore. I'm not saying opium wasn't a problem - it was - but the problems were nothing like the heroin problems of today. Similarly, the Incas probably didn't too much damage to themselves when they were just munching coca leaves; it was when it was processed into cocaine and then crack cocaine that the trouble began. Western scientists did apparently have medical purposes in mind at the time but the fact remains that the more potent forms wouldn't exist if they hadn't got it in their heads to tamper with nature. But that also begs the question of why it is that so many people are drawn to the hardcore alternatives...    OxyContin  (oxycodone hydrocloride: opioid = painkiller)  Dubbed poor man's heroin, this is a popular little pill in the US.    PCP  (phencyclidine: angel dust = diassociative anesthetic)  I have met few people who have tried this drug but my knowledge of it is best summarised by what one of these people told me. The person in question was an attractive, very posh man I met on Hat Rin beach in Thailand on New Year's Eve, and I have no reason to believe he wasn't telling me the truth. When I met him he was passed out on the beach and when he came round he was thoroughly disorientated from drinking. We went to a bar and bought some vodka/red bulls to wake him up and of course I asked him how he came to be there etc. Apparently he was staying somewhere on the island and had lost his friend somewhere and didn't know the name of the establishment or have any money. However, he wasn't particulary concerned. Until recently he had been in control of several successful businesses in London and lived in a very fashionable part of town but he had lost everything as a consequence of fucking up on drugs and getting involved with a difficult woman. Cocaine? I asked him. But no, it was PCP. He then launched into a very eloquent description of the drug's positive effects and the consequent negative effect it had had in his life, so it was impossible in my mind to separate one from the other. Basically, he said that PCP is believed to affect the part of your brain that is associated with our in-built conception and understanding of God, or at least a universal presence that is beyond the world of preceptive reality. When you take the drug you therefore come closest to experiencing God - as you conceive it - which is probably the same feeling you might experience when you die (assuming, like me, that you believe in an afterlife). So it's very powerful stuff. Whether you believe in God or not, it obviously takes you somewhere within yourself that is well beyond the normal reaches of your mind. And, naturally, many people like the place and want to go back, again and again, which is where the trouble begins. PCP is a relatively rare drug, and expensive, and can lead to schizophrenic type behavior, as well as the usual mood disorders and depression associated with most long term drug use. My English aristocrat had been ordered to leave the country by his family in the hope he may get his head together. Thailand doesn't strike me as the best place to do such a thing but he claimed he had already been everywhere else except Africa, and had no desire to go there. I never found out what happened to him because later that evening, as we were on our way to dinner, he quite simply vanished.    Rohypnol  (flunitrazepam: a benzodiazepine = depressant)  This is a hardcore drug that's not even available on prescription in the US. Unlike many of the other sedatives, Rohypnol wil put the most serious insomniac to sleep. Fast. So there's not much recreational purpose to it though most people will be aware that some men use it to sedate women and have sex with them against their will. Those men should be castrated; end of story.    Speed  (methamphetamine/amphetamine = stimulant)  If I'm correct, crack is cocaine minus the hydrochloride while speed is methamphetamine plus the hydrochloride, and amphetamine is their weaker nephew. Whatever the case, speed is the name usually given to the snortable powder form of the amphetamine family. Often it's used by people who want to get high but can't afford coke, or don't like coke, or want something that lasts longer than coke. It's also used by people called Speed Freaks who just totally happen to love it. I don't personally like it much and it makes me chew my mouth to pieces, which aint a very hot look.    Tabacco   Smoking used to be a fine art like drinking wine. If you read any of the classic novels it always makes mention of the after-dinner moment when the gentlemen retreat to a private room to smoke while the ladies gossip; and in  The Count of Monte Cristo  everyone is impressed by his vast range of global varieties and expertise on the subject (he also puts himself to sleep with the aid of an opium and hashish concoction). Some men would use pipes to smoke tabacco while others preferred cigars, and then the ladies took up smoking cigarettes with elegant holders: it was all so pleasant and gentile. Nowadays millions of people chain smoke low quality cigarettes with little regard for what it is they're even doing. Admittedly some people still genuinely enjoy the taste and sensation of a particular cigarette, especially after sex or eating or taking drugs or something, but for many it's just an addiction as gross as biting your nails. Everyone knows that the addictive ingredient in tabacco is nicotine and I recently watched a movie (don't know the name but starring Pacino and Crowe) in which it was clamed that tabacco companies add chemicals to their product so that it is more quickly absorbed by the body and passes from the blood to the brain in tact, or something like that. You don't need to be very smart to figure out that inhaling smoke of any description - wood, crack, meth, pot - isn't good for a vital organ as sophisticated and delicate as the lung, but if they can make caffeine-free coffee why can't they make nicotine-free cigarrettes? Developed countries have now received a huge heads up about the dangers of smoking and the contents of cigarettes but some developing countries, which don't even have much in the way of food and water, are still massively hooked. Personally, I'm all for the bans that are sweeping the world: it's nice not having smoke blown in your face when you're eating at a restaurant or having your clothes smell like an ashtray when you leave a club (though they do lose something in atmosphere I think). In Japan you can still smoke nearly everywhere and at my school the teachers can even smoke just outside the staffroom, in front of the children, which is about as cool as cancer.    Temazepam  (a benzodiazepine = depressant)  Temazepam is a sedative used to chill people or out or put them to sleep but combined with alcohol it almost has the effect of a crazy upper. Some people might get dopey but it makes others horribly cocky and stupid, and unable to feel pain or register consequences of stuff, like you're padded with cotton wool. It's fairly easy to die if you take too many of these things and that risk would be enhanced if you drank a lot too.    Valium  (diazepam: a benzodiazipine = depressant)  This is the drug referenced in the Rolling Stone's "Mother's Little Helper". It's a long-acting anti-anxiety sedative. A low dose won't necessarily knock you out so it's often used recreationally for hangovers or comedowns rather than as a sleeping pill.    Vicodin  (hydrocodone: an opioid = painkiller)  A hip US painkiller that's like codeine but stronger because of the hydrogen atom that's attached.  The Face  ran an excellent feature article called A Vicodin Odyssey in Vegas. It suggested that Vicodin conveniently puts a bubble between you and reality: useful if circumstances are less than ideal.    Xanex  (alprazolam: a benzodiazepine = depressant)  Sends you into a solid sleep or removes all your anxiety, stress and panic: the modern woman's little helper.

      I'm fairly lazy (namakemono) so I don't study as much as I should but to aid me I'm going to summarize what I learn on this page. Obviously the first thing you should do if you're serious about the language is memorize katakana (used to vaguely represent stuff like foreign words), hiragana (used to spell some Japanese words and construct grammar) and start studying kanji (complicated picture things borrowed from Chinese - you need about 2000 to read the newspaper). However, I will be writing all of this in romaji, which is the roman alphabet version of Japanese.     First, let's small-talk about the weather!   WA is the standard subject particle and DESU is kind of like BE but it comes at the end of the sentence and changes to DESHITA when you're talking about the past; KA is the question particle. But you don't actually need to name the subject if its obvious who/what you're talking about and you can drop the DESU in informal speech. If you add NE to the end of the sentence it's like saying "innit?", and YO is like "I'm telling ya", and SO is actuallly a bit like the meaning of "so".   watashi = I anata = you kare = he kanojo = she watashi tachi = we  kyoo = today kinoo = yesterday konshu = this week senshu =last week raishu =next week  atsui = hot samui = cold atatakai = warm suzushi =cool  watashi wa atsui desu = I am hot   kinoo wa samui deshita = yesterday was cold  ananta wa atsui desu ka = are you hot? atsui desu ka = are you hot?  atsui? = are you hot? [intonation only] atsui desu yo = man, it's hot!  atsui desu ne = it's hot, isn't it? so nan desu ka = is that so? so desu ne = yeah, it totally is.    Second, let's talk about verbs!   Verbs are in 3 groups and there are rules about each one and how to make them and it's kind of annoying because they all conjugate differently to make the negative (don't) and past (did) and conditional (if) and imperative (do it) etc. The casual-speech form appears in dictionaries and ends in U and the more formal version ends in MASU; there are also honorific and humble forms but I'm not bothered about that right now. The groups are determined by what you have to do to change the U form into the MASU form: 1 - drop the U and add MASU (aru - arimasu = to have); 2 - drop the RU and add MASU (iru - imasu = to be); 3 - irregular (there are only two, as below). The TE form is used for things like requests (please do it) and the present continuous (I am doing it). There are some fabulously logical rules for how to make the TE form from the MASU form, which I'll mention when I write about one of the TE uses. The presumptive form is self-explanatory: you use it when you're presuming something will happen as a consequence of something else happening. The volitional form is used to suggest doing something or to express an inclination for doing something (Let's do it / I think I'll do it); if you add KA to the volitional it's more polite (Won't you please do it with me?). There are also potential (possibility/capability), passive (someone did something to me that affected me badly), causative (someone made something happen) and causative passive (someone made me do something that affected me badly) forms.  Below are some postive / negative examples.   Group 1 eg: asobu = to play, enjoy oneself  plain present - asobu / asobanai  plain past - asonda / asobanakatta MASU present - asobimasu / asobimasen MASU past - asobimashita / asobimasendeshita imperative - asobe / asobu na TE form - asonde / asobanakute conditional plain - asobeba / asobanakereba conditonal formal - asobimashita ra / asobimasendeshita ra presumptive plain - asobu daroo / asobanai daroo presumptive formal - asobu daroo / asobanai daroo volitional plain - asoboo volitional formal - asobimashoo potential - asoberu passive - asobareru causative - asobaseru causative passive - asobaserareru  Group 2 eg: neru = to go to bed plain present - neru / nenai plain past - neta / nenkatta MASU present - nemasu / nemasen MASU past - nemashita / nemasendeshita imperative - nero / neru na TE form - nete / nenakute conditional plain - nereba / nenakereba conditional formal - nemashita ra / nemasen deshita ra presumptive plain - neru daroo / nenai daroo prseumptive formal - neru deshoo / nenai deshoo volitional plain - neyoo voltional formal - nemashoo potential - nigerareru passive - nigerareru causative - nigesaseru causative passive - nigesaserareru  Group 3: kuru = to come plain prsent - kuru / konai plain past - kita / konakatta MASU present - kimasu / kimasen MASU past - kimashita / kimasen deshita imperative - koi / kuru na TE form - kite / konakute conditional plain - kureba / konakereba conditional formal - kimashita ra / kimasen deshita ra presumptive plain - kuru daroo / konai daroo presumptive formal - kuru deshoo/ konai deshoo volitional plain - koyoo volitional formal - kimashoo   potential - koreru passive - korareru causative - kosaseru casuative passive - kosaserareru   Group 3: suru = to do plain present - suru / shinai plain past - shita / shinakatta MASU present - shimasu / shimasen MASU past - shimashita / shimasen deshita imperative - shiro / suru na TE form - shite / shinakute conditional plain - sureba / shinakereba conditional formal - shimashita ra / shimasen deshita ra presumptive plain - suru daroo / shinai daroo prseumptive formal - suru deshoo / shinai deshoo volitional plain - shiyoo volitional formal - shimashoo potential - dekiru passive - sareru causative - saseru causative passive - saserareru   Another thing about verbs: they are either transitive (need an object: "I like watching TV") or intransitive (don't need an object: "I like dancing"). Sometimes a verb is only one or the other but sometimes the spelling of a verb just changes slightly to make both. Also, most of them have multiple similar meanings (in which case I'll just write the ones I consider the most useful) and some have another totally different meaning (which means the kanji would be different, in which case I'll mention it [like this]).    Transitive eg: kowasu = to break / destroy / injure kowasu / kowasanai kowashita / kowasanakatta kowashimasu / kowashimasen kowashimashita / kowashimasen deshita watashi no tomodachi wa tokei o kowashimashita = my friend broke the watch (watashi = I, NO = posssesion particle, tomodachi = friend, WA = subject particle, tokei = watch, O = object particle, kowashimashita = broke)    Intransitive eg: kowareru = to be broken / damaged / out of order kowareru / kowarenai kowareta / kowarenakatta kowaremasu / kowaremasen kowaremashita / kowaremasen deshita   tokei ga kowaremashita = the watch is broken (no human subject, tokei = watch, GA = emphasised subject particle, kowaremashita = broken)

      I'm from NZ but currently living in Japan. These are some things I find interesting or irritating, depending on the day.   Yakei  This is my favorite Japanese word: it means urban night view. The best ones I've seen have been climbing Mt Fuji at night and looking over the Yamanashi basin at all the twinkling towns and suburbs, and looking out at Tokyo from the 40th-floor bar of the Cerulean Tower in Shibuya, which is comparable to the hotel bar featured in Lost in Translation.     Fruit  The Japanese peel all of it. Like many people peel apples and everyone peels bananas and oranges but they also always peel grapes and they even take off the white bit separating the segments inside the orange, and eat the straight flesh out of the thin white bit. It's messy and looks odd to me though I suppose it does mean you get the full deal.   Shoes  Most people will be aware that the Japanese don't wear the same shoes inside that they wear outside but perhaps you don't know the consequences of this. Most public buildings (like schools or small offices) will have slippers for guests to wear but some people carry around their own little pair in a bag. Comfort is given priority over formality so seniors will often rock cool sneaks inside and wear leather shoes outside; this means I can get away with wearing trainers all the time. It's fairly cool for school kids to destroy their sneakers by walking on the backs of them. Also, young women often hobble around in their high heels with the straps undone and dragging on the street or crushed under their feet.    Karetta and Ametta  The Japanese metaphorically categorise people according to whether they like cake or alcohol, which basically means you're either a lush or a little piggy. I'm actually both but I had to confess to having the stronger tendency toward booze.    Let's enjoy...!  This is heavily overused to the point of banality. For example, last week I saw written on a can of tuna: Let's enjoy eating sea chicken together! Everything, it seems, is intended to be supremely pleasureable, usually for a group of people.   Personal Questions  I think the convention of not asking a lady her age may still stand in Japan but people aren't shy about asking me anything. Today, in a single lunch hour, I was asked: Are you menstruation? What high are you? What are your 3 numbers? [meaning chest, hips and waist] Do you play... whisper, whisper? (meaning sex).      Omiyage (souvenirs)    It is customary to bring your colleagues some small gifts when you have been away somewhere further than your local region. Usually the gifts will be identical for everyone and often they will be edible, like wrapped biscuits or chocolates. They even have cake that comes with individual plastic around each piece, though you still buy the whole. If you've gone to another country you may want to bring a bigger token of proof and generosity. It is a nice idea but wearisome if you already have a lot of baggage and must then contend with not fracturing a box of shortbread. Luckily the airport has chocolates brightly wrapped with pictures of various countries for this express purpose. Like many things in Japan, omiyage is given so automatically that you wonder if there is much sincerity behind it. But when you consider how little time the average worker takes off work perhaps travel is actually a much bigger deal to them than I can imagine.     Money    Japan is a cash-based society so I often have about 4 man in my wallet (a man is 10 000 yen, roughly US$100). Most cash machines shut at a certain point in the evening, night or weekend and if they are open they'll charge you money to use them after the bank has shut, which might be as early as 3pm. In my village there is only one machine I can use and sometimes when I go they have a sign up saying something in Japanese and the number 10, presumably meaning come back in 10 minutes. Inside there will be a man sweeping the floor or ducking in and out of a little back room, presumably to stock it with cash. A few places accept major credit cards but I don't think anyone's even heard of EFTPOS which I've used to buy things as little as gum for years in NZ, plus get cash back. In summary, NZ is rather advanced in this respect and Japan is not.   Kanji     It didn't take me too long to learn the hiragana and katanana symbols that are used for grammatic and phonetic purposes. Sometimes I still get certain ones confused and sometimes I can read the katakana but can't figure out what English word it's supposed to represent, especially because they use r for l. But I hate kanji and I refuse to learn a single one, even such obvious ones as man and woman. Kanji makes Japanese a very elitist language because if you don't know a symbol you've got no way of guessing at it whatsoever, making whole sentences unintelligible. Apparently you need 2000 to read a newspaper and high school children only know 1000 so they're excluded. Children's books have the hiragana written beside them but otherwise this it's an infrequent practice. At least in English you can guess at the meaning from other related stem words or just look it up in a dictionary or ask someone. In Japan there are now a number of kanji which nobody but zen masters can fathom and it's not even original, they borrowd it from Japan. I'm all for romaji myself, which what they call it when you use the roman alphabet to transcribe Japanese. Fuck drawing, let's write.   Toilets  The Japanese call it toire, which is nice and easy to remember, but people often just say chotto when they are telling others where they are going. This literally means a little but is used in many ways to indicate something that you don't explicity want to talk about. On my first night in Tokyo we were eating in a busy alley of small restaurants that shared the same facilities. I asked an old woman where they were located and thought I'd been tricked when I found myself staring at a horizontal urinal. Alas, the Japanese aren't famed for playing such tricks and I've now grown accustomed to these glorified holes in the ground. They look as if they'd be cheaper than regular toilets but apparently the real reason for their use is hygiene. It's true you no longer have to share seats with strangers but the downside is that many people can't aim that well and the areas on either side just aren't all that clean sometimes. It's a totally different story in nice department stores where you may find yourself in a cubicle, seated on a warm seat with all manner of electronic bidets, listening to the sound of gushing water emitting from some unseen speakers to avoid the embarrassment of other people hearing your own noises. There might be a sensory flusher that you wave your hand in front of or it may flush automatically when you stand up.   Karaoke  I hated karaoke before I came to Japan because I am a terrible singer and thought the whole thing was just a generally terrible idea. But in Japan, where people don't often socialise at each others house and certainly not in big numbers, it provides an affordable, neutral space to hang out all night, drink, eat and have a bit of harmless fun. It was great at a recent enkai to see the quiet secretary come out of her shell and be the sex-siren I always suspected she could be. It's a chance for people to shine and be creative if they've got talent that's been buried since high school, but everyone will take part even if they're tone deaf. My main wish is that they were able to use the artists' actual songs and that there was a function to have them sing the words so you could just chill out with a jukebox on occasion, instead of listening to sub-standard instrumental versions of all your favourite songs. Some of the places have really current books, with Britney's latest track appearing weeks after its release, as well as classic oddities like The Happy Mondays.     Blood Types  Most Japanese people know what blood type they are, including very young children. They consider it to be another psuedo-accurate way of categorising people, like astrological horoscopes and your Chinese birth-year animal. Apparently there are numerous authoritative people and texts on the matter.   Brushing Teeth  I don't know if it's normal in business offices but at my school everyone is fanatical about brushing their teeth. They all keep toothbrushes and paste someplace and some of the staff spend about 5 minutes brushing their teeeth while they get on with their work or read the paper or stand oustide watching the kids playing baseball or softball on the dirt field.    Enkai (Drinking Parties)   Going out with your colleagues is not so unusual in itself. Usually there will be a fixed cost per person and several courses of food with unlimited drinking of beer, sake and iced tea. Many women don't drink alcohol and some people will have to drive so there is often a big discrepency between people's levels of drunkness by the end of the night. The unusal part is that the party will always follow a very rigid pattern of speechmaking. Unlike in NZ where everyone has a drink thrust at them as soon as they arrive so that everyone can begin loosening up asap, you wait till everyone is present then the person in charge of organising that particular party (the MC) will make an opening welcome speech, then ask a senior member of staff to say a few words. Another senior member will then ask everyone to fill everyone elses glasses in order to make a toast, only then does drinking and eating commence. A while later, speeches will begin. Everyone will be expected to speak and the subject will vary depending on the occasion. There will often be a sheet of numbers and topics and everyone will draw a number from a lot to decide what they speak about. At the old staff leaving party it was high and low points of the school year for various semesters. At the new staff welcoming party it was a speech of introduction followed by another person's first impression of them, a surprisingly candid and frank idea for a nation whose opinions are usually veiled by polite formalites. The night will then continue until all eating and drinking has been done, then someone will say Banzai 3x and the others will echo them enthusiastically. This is to pray for good fortune as far into the future as has been in the past.    School Cleaning: the buildings   The students and most of the staff are responsible for cleaning the school everyday. The brooms for inside are good and wide but the outside ones are small and sometimes even resemble a witches broom with a bunch of useless sticks on the end. There's no way I'm ever going to get to work with one of those things. They use cold water and hand cloths to clean the floors and so they're never done very thoroughly although this isn't so bad as everyone has different shoes to wear indoors. Naturally, the students aren't very meticulous when it comes to cleaning their toilets and sometimes just spray the whole area with cold water. I don't know why it's like this. My school is small yet they has excellent facilities with numerous computers and cameras etc. Maybe cleaning the school themselves teaches the kids to be responsible for their own mess but they could at least get some decent equipment and spare a little hot water.     School Cleaning: the teachers  Staff are employed by the prefectural Board of Education, not individual schools, and in April every year some members of every school are transferred to others. There is a 7-year limit to how long anyone can stay at one school so sometimes it is expected. Other times relations may not be going so well so staff will request to be moved. Other times they may wish to be transferred to a particular school for any number of personal reasons. Sometimes they are just moved and it is quite shocking and sad, especially because they may find themselves having to drive an extra hour down narrow, busy roads to get to work every morning. The teachers have about a week after they find out to clear their desks and move schools before the new year starts. Soon after, everyone will go out to an enkai (see below)to get to know each other in the hope of fostering smooth relations in the coming year.    School Clubs  My school is small so the choice is fairly limited but the boys must choose between baseball and table tennis and the girls between softball and volleyball, or else anyone can choose music. They are then unofficially branded by their choice for the remainder of time at school and there are definitely stereotypes like the popular loud boys playing baseball and the quiet strange kids playing tabletennis. Most bizarrely, the kids voluntarily come early in the morning to practise and stay till as late as 6pm in the afternoons. I guess it's because their houses are small and there's not much in the way of parks or arcades nearby. Or maybe they just love their games.

      I think everyone who's even mildly into music probably likes some that's from Manchester even if they don't specifically know it. In roughly chronological order, these are the musicians I rate: Joy Division, New Order, The Smiths, 808 State, A Guy called Gerald, The Happy Mondays, The Stone Roses, The Doves, Oasis, Rae and Christian, Marcus Intalex, and all the DJ/producers at paperecordings.

      I have a friend who is heavily into most forms of music; his knowledge of rock is extensive and he likes hip hop and has all kinds of jazz and blues and soul and all that stuff that people ought to know and love but about which I'm fairly ignorant. EDM wouldn't exist if it wasn't for all these forms, though knowing this doesn't prevent me from liking the final sum more than its respective parts. My friend feels differently. Sometimes I use his laptop to burn CDs for people and last night I found out he then deletes it all. What if someone asks you if you've got any house one day? I asked; his reply was negligible.&nbsp;Earlier in the night I had played him an excellent specimen of hip house (Rythnerd by Joshua) and he said he thought it was pretty good but a few beers later he cheekily refered to it as "trance hop", thus revealing his true opinion. It's always humbling when someone you respect has little regard for something you consider to be so significant: it totally puts things into perspective and makes you realize we're all more or less a type of one kind or another and none can ever be proven superior. Having said that, trance is a fucking dirty word in my books and I think the vast majority of it sucks and is almost entirely responsible for giving the rest of EDM a bad name. Heaven forbid that anyone does actually produce tracks that fit the trance hop description because that would surely turn even more people off our cause or, worse, attract a horde of dummy-sucking, glowstick-wielding wannabe gangstas.

      Based in San Francisco, OM is home to some of the finest electronic music on the planet. It's worth making particular note of Mark Farina and Rithma who had albums out in 2003 and 2002 respectively. Farina is a veteran of the scene having produced his first tracks in the late-80s with the likes of Derrick Carter. His album  Air Farina  is brilliant and a fitting tribute to all the hard-working DJs out there hauling ass around the world to take their music to the discerning masses. Rithma is relatively new and young but his  Music Fiction  is equally wonderful. Both albums span the spectrum of tasteful beats in a flowing fashion while featuring some proper grinding dancefloor house tunes that have been successfully remixed and released on 12". You should buy both albums as well as checking the rest of OM's catalog:  urlLink http://www.om-records.com   &nbsp;

      I love Underworld and the remaining two members seem to be doing fine since DJ Darren Emerson left a couple of years back. Of course Born Slippy will never be forgotten and they have a number of other outstanding classics that continue to get airplay but I think the best thing about them is that every album has been brilliant, like the whole thing. From  dubnobasswithmyheadman  to  Second Toughest ,  Beaucoup Fish  and  100 Days , they're all just excellent. They also gave one of the best DJ/production type concerts I've ever been to, or maybe that doesn't even need qualifying and it was the best gig of anything period. The show was at the Apollo in Manchester and I went to the little famous bar round the corner first and met a few lovely Mancs and drank pints of Stella and had a great old time. Furthermore, Darren Emerson was actually majorly responsible for turning me onto house - particulary the deep, driving, percussive kind - because I went with my then-boyfriend Mooner to The End in London to catch Grooverider spinning dnb in the lounge, but ended up dancing away in the mainroom to Emerson's 4/4 beats instead. Seminal stuff.

      As well as Underworld, these bands have done great things in terms of bringing techno type beats into the mainstream. The first two are now defunct and maybe The Orb is too but their legacy should live on for a long time yet. If you're not really into EDM and just wanted to get a quality overview you could do a lot worse than buying all their back catalogues. Lovely, trippy, broken, deep, lost music.

      I had long been familiar with the name Doc Martin but I didn't really know what he was about except that it&nbsp;had&nbsp;nothing to do with the boots. Then he came to AK (apparently he has a NZ girlfriend) but wasn't booked to play and so they had an impromptu gig at the Wyndam St Bowling Club. This may have been in 01 or 02 - I'm not sure. We ate some mushrooms and had a really fun night that was made even better by the spontaneity of it all. Then I heard&nbsp;Doc&nbsp;play at Ruby Skye in SF but I had places to go and people to see (specifically Hector Moralez at Club 6) so I left the grand old superclub early for more underground shores. However, later that week, I managed to get a copy of his set and have listened to it a lot and concluded he's right up my street. I've also bought a couple of his silly, fun, acidic records and know that he runs/owns Wax Records in LA:  urlLink http://www.waxrecords.com &nbsp;And on the Intellect DVD  urlLink http://www.stepfilms.com &nbsp;he comes across really well, explaining that when they started throwing parties they only had 1 turntable so every track had to count -&nbsp;there could be no fillers or bullshit. There are 2 styles of house that&nbsp;keep me out on the floor:&nbsp; the crazy electrofunk shenanigans of the likes of the paperecordings boys, and the twisted, slightly proggy, deep sound of Doc and Darren Emerson. The former makes you want to down a bottle of vodka, drop a load of pills and and&nbsp;get naughty in the bathrooms;&nbsp;the latter&nbsp;sends you on a rollercoaster ride that's hard to jump off once you've signed your brain on. You should check the good doctor if you get the chance.

      Primal (Berkely), Tweekin (SF) and Wax (LA) Records are all excelllent shops that have good online facilities:   urlLink http://www.primalrecords.com   urlLink http://www.tweekin.com   urlLink http://www.waxrecords.com  The main drawback is that vinyl is heavy so it's expensive to have it posted if you're outside the country. All three also function as a label and feature their own releases prominently.  Beatport is online only:  urlLink http://www.beatport.com &nbsp; They're constantly&nbsp;in the process of signing up labels so the already impressive selection should only grow over time. The advantage is that it's cheap and instant, the disadvantage is it's not vinyl - if that's what you want.

      General opinion seems to be that the recent batch have had their day but there's so many of them and they're so diverse that this simply can't be true. These are the ones I like anyhow: The White Stripes (sexy, dark rock from a disfunctional Detroit two-piece), The Rapture (electrorock, "like The Cure on pills), The Shins (Beach Boy/Beatle-esque band from the southern US), The Strokes (certifiably cool lo-fi), The Datsuns (wild NZ de Dolf rockers that are fantastic live).

      These boys totally know how to rock it. I haven't heard them spin together yet but they're wicked individual DJs and their production collaborations are sweet. They can do house every way you like and Joshua does downbeat stylings as well, while Diz can also sing. Both originally from Chicago, Iz is now based in SF so they've got two of the world's EDM capitals fully covered. Most of their stuff is only available on 12" but hopefully an album will be out soon...

      I think The Beatles' self-titled white album is their best. It contains such gems as The Long and Winding Road and Here Comes the Sun, and is both poppy and experimental. Everyone should be familiar with it so I shan't say anymore. I first heard of Jay-Z when he sampled Annie's little voice in Hard Knock Life but don't remember hearing much of his stuff until recently when I borrowed my friend's copy of  The Black Album  and listened to it while walking around suburban Japan on a bright sunny day, far from the streets of Brooklyn. Sure, the album is all about him but that's only in keeping with the showmanship of serious urban hip hop and my friend also told me the album is meant to be his last, so serves as a kind of final word on the subject. Tellingly, there are no guest MCs. The structure is impressive, building up from some introductory tracks to a few hard-hitting anthems to the sentimental bigging-up at the end. My particular favourite is Justify my Thug with the words -   Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us  Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up Every other corner there's a liquor store - what the fuck's up?   Then DJ Dangermouse came up with idea of laying Jay-Z's rhymes over music sampled entirely from the The Beatles, with superb results. The production on Jay-Z's album is tight with many of hip hop's best producers providing some incredible beats and noises, but I actually like Dangermouse's work better. Despite the fact it's all sampled, or maybe because of it, the music sounds wicked interesting and original with some of The Beatles prettiest moments preserved in full. And the egotism of Jay-Z's lyrics is softened by the fact he released an acapella version of his album to allow people to do exactly this kind of thing, which is the way things should be in today's heavily cross-referenced popular culture. Genius.

      The first live concert I ever went to was in Gisborne in 1988 with my family, at an outdoor stadium and featuring Dave Dobbyn. Later that year we saw When the Cats Away perform at the same place; both were very memorable. My father lives in a small town in NZ called Whakatane and there's not a lot to do besides beach walking and swimming at Ohope, or fishing and other outdoor pursuits. So when I was down there one Christmas, I jumped at the chance to go with my cousin and hear him perform again; this time accompanied by the lovely Lucy Lawless and supported by Anika Moa. The gig was at a sports hall in some small town outside Tauranga, the beer was cheap and the people were happy. Along with people like Peter Urlich, Mr Dobbyn is an essential part of the NZ music community and he has produced a number of timeless classics over the years. But my favorites are the songs he did for Alan Ball's cartoon movie Footrot Flats. Long may he live and sing.

      I grew up in small town NZ surrounded by surfers, metalers and bikers so I've long been familiar with the name Black Sabbath but only just discovered the delights of their music. Of course, my interest in all things Osborne has risen dramatically since their reality TV show but music is music and sometimes you just don't like it no matter how much you might want to. So it was with great pleasure that my friend and I drank a bottle of Jim Beam and realized that Black Sabbath are indeed a great rock n roll band. They have some heavier moments, as every band should, but there's few things more beautiful than the sounds of Ozzy's voice and the strings/synth on Changes.

      if you dont care about punctuation and never really got the hang of it at school and are really happy that many people dont use it much any more then this book probably wont appeal to you much and i wouldnt bother reading it but i think its really funny and worthwhile and helpful because i love the english language and i love writing... Ms Truss would probably have a heart attack if she ever came across a copy of my book, if god were a manc. For one thing, the title is written in lower case. Two: I attempted to depict the many different accents that abound in the Manchester area, and they are very inconsistent with each other and within the dialogue of a single character. This is because I was still making my mind up about to do it while I wrote it and so any time I changed my mind I would inevitably have to go back and change what I had previously written, but would miss some. Three: the dialogue is contained in single apostrophes, not double speech marks. Four: my use of the comma can definitely be yobbish in places and just plain wrong in others. The good news is, however, I'm now almost finished writing another book that has no customized depiction of speech other than the characters' individual lexicons; and I'm playing grave attention to my commas, colons, and semi-colons. Sometimes I use the oxford comma (as I just did in the previous sentence) and sometimes I don't. Here's hoping it will be a work that would make Truss smile rather than cry.

      It took me ages to read this book because I left it at work as a filler between other activites and when I told my dad I was reading it he&nbsp;expressed surprise that I hadn't already&nbsp;done so&nbsp;because it's such a classic. However,&nbsp;I&nbsp;had already&nbsp;seen the movie and&nbsp;so I thought&nbsp;I was prepared for the plot but I just finished it and I'm a little baffled. What happened to the showdown with all&nbsp;the murderous bad guys?&nbsp;Who's the blonde boy? Am I stupid? Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong movie or maybe they took&nbsp;the liberty&nbsp;to&nbsp;have it end in an&nbsp;infinitely more exciting fashion than the anti-climactic, mysterious final pages of the novel. Whatever, the translation&nbsp;I read was a pleasure to behold - I can only imagine how&nbsp;lovely the story&nbsp;would be in the original French -&nbsp;and&nbsp;I love that era of civilisation.

      I still haven't read  Sex and the City   but I did read  4 Blondes , and loved it. Trade Up continues the story of one of those blondes - Janey Wilcox - as she attempts to rise and rise within the cream of NYC society. Bushnell manages to convey the extent of her egotism in a fashion that is so convincing you get genuinely annoyed with the woman and just want to give her a good slap around the face. But, like all good authors, every character is brought to life in such a way that no-one is strictly good or evil: nothing is black and white. I haven't yet been to New York but people say she does a fine job of portraying the ruthless maneuvering of the privileged set who are constantly competing to be the most sophisticated, most rich, most fashionable, most famous, most talented etc etc. Wilcox's past is cleverly weaved into the story so that we are aware of the significance of the silly little screenplay she wrote the previous summer, when  4 Blondes  was set, and so we can further understand the way her mind currently works. Eventually she falls hard and Candace brilliantly depicts what such a fall entails for people in the public eye, while her resurrection is nothing short of genius. Her books may be chick-lit but they are also a witty, insightful reflection of a particular way of life; one that is coveted by people all over the world.

      I recently read my first Sherlock Holmes stories and so I can finally understand what all the fuss is all about. Like why his silhouette is all over Baker St station in London and why he's so famous that people think he was real and Watson really was his biographer. The technique of using Watson as Doyle does is very effective. It means we are able to get close to the character without losing the mystique of when a complex person explains themselves directly to us. In fact, we are probably able to get a better view than if that had been the case because it's undoubtedly true that people often see in us what we don't see for ourselves, good and bad.  As one critic said, it is not the stories themselves which keep people coming back for more because, although clever, they are utterly formulaic and even predictable. Rather, it is Holmes himself that people love, myself included. He is egotistical and egocentric but more quietly smug than overtly arrogant. Best of all, he has terrible moods, uses cocaine, drinks, smokes and adores music. What more could you want of a classic hero?

      This is the first book in a while that I simply couldn't put down and finished in a matter of days. It is beautifully written and detailed in its account of the plight of a boy stranded on a lifeboat with a Royal Bengal tiger. But most enjoyable was the buildup to the shipwreck and the short account of what happened after. I believe it is a fictitious account of a true story but my friend disagrees and I have no desire to find out the truth, preferring to believe what pleases me. At its core, the story is an eloquent illustration of the fact that people choose to honour God through a mutliplicity of established religions and there is no way of ever determining which is right and which is wrong. We must all simply find an explanation for life that best suits our purpose or, better yet, simply appreciate it for the mystery that it is without the inherent complications of trying to articulate a universal definition. Animals can co-exist well enough but it seems men will always seek to outdo each other, destroying the environment for everything else in the process. Okay, so I'm totally rambling now; this book is very thought provoking. A memorable sentence? "Hunting whales is a heinous crime."

      I have mixed feelings about this book, and about any book or film that starts brightly and ends badly. I know that art isn't obliged to endlessly entertain us with pretty escapism and I like a good tragedy as much as the next man, it's just that there are certain scenarios that I hate to see go wrong. The Talented Mr Ripley is an excellent example of this. Many people probably enjoyed the psychological tension that ensued after Jude Law's character was bashed in the head, but I didn't. I would have much preferred to continue watching him charming everyone with his beauty and talent at the jazz parties and beach soirees of 1930s Italy, or whenever/wherever it was. Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow in stunning frocks sipping wine? Yes please. Similarly, Tender is the Night begins brightly on a beach in 1920s France. We meet a young film star and a set of wealthy people who love to get a little tight drinking champagne and the dialogue and social commentary is brilliant. As the story progresses we are brought to the realisation that something is a little amiss with the wife of the central character, Dickie, and Fitzgerald cleverly ends Part 1 to go back and outline the situation for us. It isn't a happy tale but worse is to come in Part 3 when he brings us up to the present again and we see the rest of their lives played out.  It would be difficult not to draw comparisons with Fitzgerald's own life at this point. He too was a huge drinker and had a mentally unstable wife. He too hit a peak in his career and social standing then disintegrated personally and financially. The difference is we know what happened to Fitzgerald whereas Tender is the Night ends by telling us Dickie had returned to America and was thought to be working as a doctor somewhere in the New Jersey area, or something. But why could he not have collected the highest professional accolades and retired in Paris in a grand mansion overlooking the River Seine?  Henry James is another author who went in for this kind of ending. Portrait of a Lady anyone? No thanks. They are genius authors who seem to doubt that gravitas can be achieved in times of perfect harmony.  Dickens, on the other hand, delighted the masses by inventing all kinds of improbably happy endings for his long-suffering characters, Bleak House being a prime example. After a series of misfortunes, including losing her looks to small pox, the central character is asked to marry her old benefactor and accepts. However he knows her true heart and gives her to a young doctor instead. Dickens was writing during the Industrial Revolution in a time of great poverty and alienation. Would it really be fair of him to have indulged his fantasy of writing Great Literature by sourly destroying the lives of his own heroes and heroines?  Happiness need not be shallow. Life will always have its ups and downs but we must believe in the probability that all really will end well. It is tragic that Fitzgerald died thinking himself a failure considering how many admire his work and have emulated his style, and most of all that high fashion will forever refer to flowing, glamourous, beautiful costumes as Fitzgeraldian. The Jazz Age which he so embodied sounds like one of the best in history and I think it's a shame he wasn't able to enjoy it without the wheel of fortune turning on him quite so badly. And that he wasn't able to write of it without turning the same wheel so forcefully on his characters.

      This book is really long but I couldn't put it down and finished it in less than a week. The writing is superb and the author employs an interesting technique of talking to the reader as if you are a tourist in another age. The setting is late-19th century London and he does a fantastic job of depicting it in all it's filthy, industrious glory. Interestingly, the main contrast is between a reasonably high-class prostitute and the son of  a major manufacturer, rather than the total extremes of a poverty-stricken homeless person and a titled aristocrat. So the gulf is wide but not unbridgeable and it is that bridge which is explored in the story. Eventually, of course, it is swept away by a tide of social convention after a couple of mortalities. I didn't particularly like the ending but at least it's not your typical soft-focused resolution. Sample sentence: "Up Great Windmill Street Sugar goes, past Saint Peter's where the best of the child prostitutes will later congregate, past the Argyll Rooms where even now the cream of male aristocracy lies drunk and snoring, interleaved with snoozing whores drunk with champagne."

      This is Spear8 productions first product. I started writing it in 1999 after I'd moved from Manchester to my aunt's house in Rickmansworth (NW of London) and needed something to do to keep my brain stimulated at night after a day working mindnumbing jobs to save for a trip to Scotland. On new year's day 1997, after spending the night at Calibre at The Breaks drum n bass party, I began writing a strange autobiography called Myriad Reflectionz because I realized I had zero hair and a black eye and I wanted to figure out why. After the chronology of my life to that point there are two short stories that attempt to convey an experience I had on acid one night later in the year, at the Ed Rush gig down at The Box, when I was taken away in an ambulance after going decidedly insane. I wrote the main story in the 1st person to try and make it less self-centered and also so the names I invented for everyone would seem more plausibly fiction than if it was actually me doing stuff with non-existent people. Whether anything will ever come of it I don't know but it meant that when I came to write another story I wanted to get as far away from myself as possible. So I set it in Manchester, based it around boys and had it full of dialogue, as opposed to the endless monologue of my previous effort. Manchester had been a tough time. I didn't know anyone and didn't have any qualifications beyond high school and no work experience besides a bit of waitressing and food prep. My dad helped me out occasionally but usually I was poor and uncertain of what I was doing there though the truth is my wish had come true, I was experiencing Northern working class life first hand. My worst temping jobs were serving hideous sausages and scrambled eggs at 6am in the Manchester Youth Hostel, then crossing town to serve slop at the cafeteria at the Manchester Hospital. But mostly I worked as a paper shuffler at Friends Provident. Anyway, while I was there my mother sent me  Conversations with God  by Neale Walsche, and I had an epiphany of sorts while reading it. Kind of like the character in Being John Malchovich, I realized that "I" was actually something besides my body and I peered around the room feeling like an alien guest looking through a particularly complex pair of binoculars, namely a human being. I have never felt the same since and "if god were a manc" was my attempt to recontextualize the truths in  Conversations with God  for people who are unlikely to ever read the book themselves, or any others like it. My mother kind of raised me as a Sannysan under the guidance of Osho/Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. The name he gave me is Deepika and I'm on a bit of a mission to smash some of the illusions people have about the world and our role in it. I believe I am God, but you are too.

      When  The Face  was suspended by their publishing group in April '04, my subscription was automatically transferred to  Arena . I wasn't at all happy about losing my favorite magazine, particularly because I didn't think it boded well for my own writing career that something I rated so highly was failing so miserably in the market. Like the music industry, it seems logical to at least partially attribute falling sales to the proliferation of online alternatives but, personally, looking at a computer screen will never beat the experience of holding a heavy, glossy, fresh magazine in my hands, just as downloading digital tracks will never match the joy of flicking through vinyl. That said, you could do a lot worse than reading  Arena  every month. The men behind it are obviously very self-assured: the writing is eloquent, the content is comprehensive, the design is smart and sometimes it's funny as hell.

      Otherwise known as the style-bible,  The Face  has been around since the early eighties and has always captured the essence of popular culture before it actually becomes popular, like the seminal article on E in 1985 or the Kate Moss cover in 1990. Lately, it has become increasingly camp and while some of its cover stars have been fairly predictable - from Justin to Beyonce - the stories usually paint them in a different, often less flattering, light. They also blatantly take the piss out of people and run excellent features such as "A Vicodin Odyssey in Vegas" and "How Not to Have a Shit Life", making for an endlessly entertaining read. Sadly, it was suspended in May '04 due to a lack of dedicated readership; franky, I find that shocking and depressing.

      Having just published it's 100th issue,  Vice  is no longer the hard-to-find, coveted thing it once was and now includes a lot more advertising. But it's still free and uncompromising in it's review of the arts and disdain for all things wack, gay, naff or dull. Sometimes I still flinch when I read certain things though I think you'd be stupied to think they're out to intentionally shock you, it's just a bunch of bold people have managed to get their fingers in a dirty little pie and are all enjoying the orgy of finger fucking.

      An English magazine that used to be based in Manchester and cover all manner of cutting edge music as it happened. A few years ago it relocated South and&nbsp;then it announced it would no longer be supporting house music, which is absolutely fucking ridiculous.&nbsp;Presumably that meant they&nbsp;would&nbsp;have more time to focus on&nbsp;the highs and lows of all the sub-genres&nbsp;that come and go through fashionable, fickle London but,&nbsp;apparently, the magazine has now officially shut down. I think that's a shame even if I didn't 100% agree with their recent approach.  What the fuck's happening in the world? Does nobody like EDM anymore? Or&nbsp;is it that&nbsp;nobody reads anymore? Or is everyone just too glued to their computer screens? I'm&nbsp;still&nbsp;totally into&nbsp;chilling with a magazine, a spliff and some tunes: what about the rest of you?

       Dazed  is definitely one of the best magazines available in terms of cutting edge coverage of shit as it happens; from music, to fashion to political movements. They aim to showcase grassroots talent but you'll also find features on well-known luminaries in any field. The writing is brilliant and the images are beautiful. Rankin and Jefferson Hack allegedly started the magazine as a means of getting in on London's top party circuit and it seems they succeeded. Rankin is now a famous photographer in his own right and Hack is the father of Kate Moss' baby. The Dazed group also publishes limited edition specialist books as well as a car mag called  Intersection  and a glossy quarterly simply named  Another Magazine .

      The latter is the new incarnation of the former, though I'm yet to get my hands on a copy.  Sleaze Nation  was a very underground mag that I believe began as a London club guide so there is a big emphasis on music. They aren't afraid to criticize things by inference or by name and rarely champion huge stars of popular culture, but rather their subversive counterparts.

      I've only seen one issue of this NZ title but it seems reasonably promising. They have a fairly unique take on design and the writing is decent, but the main attraction is the content. NZ features prominiently - more than just Auckland and Wellington - and the magazine covers more areas than the arts and fashion usually featured in lifestyle publications. They get extra points from me for detailing a trip around my old neck of the woods - the East Coast of the North Island - but lose points for a music review in which it was claimed Simon Grigg was the nice part of Nice n Urlich, instead of Bevan Keys. I wouldn't normally complain about such inaccuracies but Mr Grigg is one of my heroes.

      NZ's major dance publication, it always has a free CD on the cover and sometimes they're excellent and get thrashed all over the country for months. Some people say it's the best thing about the mag, others say it's the only good thing. I think it's doing an okay job of charting the local and global EDM scene, with interviews, pretty pictures and random articles.

      This is the best NZ has to offer. It was founded by Bernard D. McDonald and Glenn Hunt, who manage and contribute to the writing and design respectively. As well as showcasing new talent in Aotearoa, they feature and photograph various interesting achievers from all over the world, from the obscure to the infamous. They often mention artists, from musicians to writers to designers, before they get their big break. It's now published quarterly rather than bi-monthly and is bigger and brighter than ever.

      Japan is not very famous for producing wine and a lot of is way too sweet; more like Ribena than Montana. However, this place is wonderful. I had a hangover and wasn't particularly in the mood for drinking but it was my first outing alone with Japanese people who don't speak English and I didn't want to be difficult. We took the guided tour first: it was an exemplary example of Japanese efficiency and I'm sure I would have learnt a lot about making wine if I had been able to understand anything that the delightful guide told us. Instead I watched the TV presentations that featured at various points and looked at the fermentation/ bottling/ labelling machines with due awe. After a slow stroll through their underground ageing vaults, we emerged into the sun and were instructed to drive up to the next stage.  The next stage turned out to be a three-tiered complex overlooking the central valley basin of Yamanashi with Kofu city to the left and Mount Fuji directly ahead in the distance. The top tier had an a la carte restaurant; the middle area had a large courtyard with tables and chairs, a shop that served free glasses of the house wine, and a bakery that produced fresh croissant and pasteries as well as selling cheese, crackers, jam and olives; the lower tier had a series of covered cave type things, under which large groups of people were feasting off yakiniku-style bbqs: prawns, scallops, beef and vegetables. Sound impressive? It should; the place is flawless. I was there with a young married couple and their 3-year-old daughter. My friend had previously prepared lunch for us all and brought it in some lovely bento boxes (compartmentalized lunch boxes), so we ate that on the middle tier with plenty of cheese, crackers and wine to give the experience a little French flavor. I had stayed at their house the previous night and witnessed authentic Japanese domestic life for the first time since I came here a year ago. Their house was very old and had minimal furniture, as is the custom, but they were very able hosts and I had a lovely time. Traditionally the family would all sleep in one big room on futon that are stored in cupboards every day. That night there was a large bed made up of three futon inside the room and a single futon just outside the door, and my friend was even sweet enough to ask me which I would prefer. My only complaint would be that her husband is a relic from the dark ages. We woke before him to take her sister to the train and at that time his wife was wearing an elegant turquoise dress. Later she emerged wearing a short, tight black and white thing that was a little trashy, if not slutty. I asked her why and she said her husband had told her she looked like a grandmother in the previous outfit, and ordered her to change it. And she did!

      SF is an incredibly compact beautiful town that is easy to like. I only spent a week there so didn't quite go everywhere but you'd probably need no more than 2 weeks to get a decent knowledge of the place. If you're into bars and restaurants and clubs and galleries and stuff, then you only really need to know about a few key streets and you're sorted. Market St leads all the way from the touristy piers, through the  Downtown  financial/shopping center and up into  Castro , the gay district. It cuts diagonally across town and the area to the south west of it is aptly called  South of Market  (Soma). This is an area full of arty warehouses, hip DJ bars and underground nightclubs. Running vertically through it are Mission St, Howard St and Folsom St, which are useful in finding your bearings along the numbered streets that cut across horizontally. 1st, 2nd and 3rd are very much downtown, 6th is known as the armpit of SF but is home to Arrow Bar, Anu, Club 6 and the End Up, which are all worth checking. 16th is the start of the  Mission  district and 24th is its center. That's where you go to get great Mexican food. Running west from mid-Market is  Haight St , which leads all the way to Golden Gate Park and was famous in the 60s/70s for all the rock n roll/free love type action that went down. I didn't spend a lot of time there but it's got a lot of records shops, alternative clothing boutiques and healthy cafes etc. The Top and Milk Bar are both on Upper Haight, which is the far end. Running parallel to it is Hayes St and the blocks known as the  Hayes Valley , which is good for independent shopping and home to BPM Records. Running north from Market is Van Ness, a main route through the city, and Polk St, which has loads of good bars. If you walk up Grant St from downtown Market you'll go through  China Town  and end up on Columbus St, which is at the heart of  North Beach . There you'll find the book shop City Lights and a bunch of arty bars and places. And just up the road is Coight Tower, which affords incredible views of the harbor and the Golden Gate Bridge. There are plenty of other micro communities nestled in the hills around the city and it's all so small that you'll find them easier just by walking around than you would using a map and public transport or whatever. But for the record, BART runs from the airport through the city and across the Bay Bridge to Berkely so is useful to get a few blocks somewhere and then walk the rest. There are lots of buses but it means figuring out what route/stop to use. A taxi from Downtown to the Mission or Upper Haight will cost about $10. And of course the trams run along the steep streets in the city center but I'd recommend you walk so you don't get fat or miss anything.

      I never had a great desire to go to Thailand, even though a number of my friends raved about it, but it's practically a rite of passage for people on the JET (government school teaching) programme in Japan, especially over the NYE break because Japan is freezing and, well, it's Japan. That is to say it's formal and rigid and organised and expensive and monocultural and not many people can speak English confidently (my opinion on a bad day anyway). So I booked a ticket without really knowing where I would go or who I would go with. It turned out a couple of friends flew into  Bangkok  at the same time, but on a different flight, so I stayed with them at various hotels for a few nights. We saw some interesting stuff driving round in tuktuks, ate some good food, drank some beer and bought some Xanex before it became prescription-only in the new year. One of my friends is gay and wanted to check some of the bars in  Pat Pong  so we did that. The first place had a bunch of young men standing on a caged platform wearing nothing but skimpy underpants with a number attached. Some of them looked a little frightened and I know if it was me I'd have to be absolutely wasted. My other friend had done some research into the Thai sex trade and knew some kids are sold into it by their parents so she wasn't too thrilled by the scene. The music wasn't too bad though and the DJ claimed to be 100% straight. We told the street hawk it wasn't quite what we had in mind and so he led us to a hardcore place where the music was hi-energy and a couple of men were fucking on a stage. One of them had his hands on the ground and his legs around the other's waist so they kind of looked like someone mowing the lawns. At one point when the lights lit up we saw that the glass box behind us was splattered with cum. Later a bunch of men came out and just stood round like at the last place except this time they were completely naked and playing with their flacid penises.   After a few days of amateur tourist activities, which didn't include anything great like seeing the palace or having clothes tailor-made, I decided to split and head south by plane. I elected to fly to  Surat Thani  and then take the ferry to  Ko Pha Ngan  because it was cheap and looked easy. As it turned out, I'd missed the last ferry and had to stay overnight in Surat then ride in a crowded bus for an hour to get to the port, then endure a 3-hour boat trip to the island. This is instead of paying a little extra to fly direct to  Koh Samui  then take a 10-minute taxi to the ferry terminal and a half-hour boat ride to Ko Pha Ngan. But actually it wasn't that bad. I attached myself to some Swedish guys and we found a cheap hotel, booked boat tickets and had a few beers. The bus ride was a proper SE Asia experience, which was necessary considering I'd decided to take the easy route and fly direct to the beach, rather than explore the country by bus and train like proper travelers. And the boat ride was fucking beautiful. I took a Xan and accepted a man's offer to stay at some bungalows to the NW of the island, even though I was due to meet my friend at the ferry terminal and go with her to Hat Rin.  At the docks was a man named Sye, waiting to take any new recruits back to Bay View at  Haad Yao Beach , as well as scope for a Xmas tree for the party the following day. I said thanks but no thanks to my friend and off we went. Turned out Sye was a bit of a DJ, into acid house and other quality beats, and he was playing that night at a bar on a beach on the north side of the island. He agreed to take me with him though that night was really the beginning and end of our friendship. After dumping my stuff in a basic bungalow on a small cliff overlooking a beautiful bay, I went swimming and waited for him at the bar. Rather than driving around the coast to get north, you have to drive back to the center then head up. The roads are shit and we got stopped along the way and one of our crew dropped a few names to avoid any hassel because the previous week Sye had had his decks confiscated after a posh new resort down the beach bribed the police to shut their party down. The authorities may have executed a couple of thousand dealers but dodgy dealings seem to be alive and well in every stratosphere of Thai society.   The venue was a lovely mediterranean-style bar that trailed down to the beach. Also booked to play was a French man who had his own CD-J decks and mixer and a lot of fantastic music. The party was a success; but I got too drunk and stoned after going on some dimly remembered adventure to another party with a stranger in a car. As the sun was coming up I met a young man named Philip and we went swimming together in our clothes, then went clambering around on some rocks trying to find the best place to watch the sky. Unfortunately I fell part way down a big gap, which had the ocean swirling at the bottom, and seriously cut my feet and legs and clothes. Philip freaked but I don't really remember what happened after that. I woke up in his bungalow, sent him to buy me some valium and we ate green curry at a beach side restaurant, in celebration of Christ's nominal birthday. I got a taxi and arrived back at Haad Yao in time for our Xmas party, absolutely wrecked. Sye immediately recognised what kind of person I was and launched into a tirade about the number of people who fuck up mixing meds with recs and alcohol. But that was exactly what I did for the rest of my holiday. Sample combination: Mojitos, a magic mushroom omelette and a little morphine. There were fantastic little parties to be had every night, amazing food, some brilliant, brilliant people, a mad NYE party at  Hat Rin  (home to the infamous Full Moon parties), massages every day and music, music, music.   It was a very incoherent and stupied and irresponsible holiday and unfortunately I got into a little trouble at the end when one of the male staff turned against me badly and I reacted by reporting him to the boss. Neither of us behaved particularly well but he was in a professional position and had turned sour on other girls before me. Still, I felt sick and tired at the end rather than cool and wild. I had to hurry to Koh Samui and grab a late flight back to Bangkok to make my flight to Japan early the next morning. So I spent my last night drinking in an airport bar and handing out all manner of medication to various odds and ends that passed my way.   Everyone should go to Thailand. The people are lovely and the country is fucking awesome.

      Tokyo is the name given to the massive area that surrounds the actual district that bears this name, which is actually rather non-descript besides having a very large train station. So when Japanese people talk about going to Tokyo they will usually mention another specific area, in the same way we would specify which city we're going to in a country. It is a vast ultra-urban megalopolis with energy and madness buzzing everywhere amidst the endless gray and brown buildings and the glittering neon lights. Dope as fuck.  Shinjuku:  Almost a city in its own right, Shinjuku is the hub of Tokyo with one of the world's largest railway stations at its center. Roughly speaking, the northwest is corporate, the east is busy and sordid and the south is good for major shopping and getting to the park.  Shibuya:  The famous youth-orientated area, home to one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in the world. It's not that big but its bright winding streets can be overwhelmingly busy with hipsters just hanging out and laughing. The many record shops are excellent, ranging from major modern stores that stock all the latest cuts to small rooms full of cardboard boxes of classics.  Harajuku:  Just up the road from Shibuya, it's the best place for street fashion with big branches of Adidas and Gap on the main streets and numerous quirky boutiques and 2nd hand stores on the back streets. If you're lucky you might catch some of the extreme looks like witchy-goths, rockabillys and milkmaids.  Aoyama:  Connected to Harajuku by a wide boulevard lined with flagship stores for the likes of Dior and Chanel, Aoyama is Harajuku's upmarket cousin. It has some quality independent stores and delicious bakeries.  Roppongi Hills:  It sounds like a district but in fact it's the name given to a modern skyscraper complex just up the road from Roppongi proper. It has several floors of shopping and a floor of restaurants at the bottom, apartments in the middle and the Mori Art Gallery at the top. Unfortunately I was hungover on the day and made the decision not to wait in line to go up and see the modern Japanese art exhibition that was showing at the time. But we had a nice enough afternoon soaking up the serene vibe in one of the restaurant courtyards of the The Hyatt Hotel, which is annexed to the main building on the same level as the dining floor. I imagine a short weekend could happily be spent staying there, eating every meal at a different place, checking the art and the panoramic views of Tokyo and making several quality purchases in between. Pure class.  Akihabara:  Known as the electric town, Akihabara is where you go to buy discount electronic goods like cameras and phones. There's not a lot there other than those shops though and you may find things just as cheap in other parts of Tokyo or indeed at home, as a friend recently found out. Still, it's worth a look.  Daikanyama:  Just south of Shibuya, Daikanyama is a lovely little neighbourhood with all the interesting fashion boutiques and people but none of the crowd or hype. There are some superior sneaker shops along one of the main roads into the district and the central area has a lovely ambience. Check it when Shinjuku and Shibuya have driven you mad.

      Piha is a very special place indeed. It is a small community with just a couple of old-fashioned dairies (convenience stores) selling basics like bread and ice cream. The shop by the beach does the best fish n chips ever and the Surf Club restaurant cooks a great steak. The licensing is such that you have to sign in as a guest when you go there and that about sums Piha up - anyone is free to go but it really is a private world unto itself. With a stunning, rugged beach framed by cliffs and spilt by the unusual land mass known as Lion Rock, Piha is an alternative playground for the young and old alike although people risk swimming in the extreme surf at their peril. Housing varies hugely from the upmarket to the very basic and there's a camping ground in the center. Home to artists, bums and a few semi-retired residents, music and drugs often play a central role in recreational activities, particularly for the electronically inclined. Auckland itself is currently in the grips of an amphetamine crisis with many people smoking a supposedly pure form known as P. However, it aint that pure and Piha has suffered more than its fair share of casualities considering the small populaton. There are other beautiful beaches nearby, accessible by foot or car, but no place quite matches its vibe.

      I was born in  Whakatane  in the Bay of Plenty and my father still lives there. It's small and kind of nice but rather dull. Across the hill is Ohope Beach, where my grandmother lived, and that's beautiful. At the age of 3 I was moved to  Gisborne  in Poverty Bay, on the east coast. The provincial names are actually quite apt because Gisborne is sunny and famous for surfing but there are a lot of people who live there that aren't doing very much, including working. When I was 10 I moved to  New Plymouth  in Taranaki, where I found my wonderful black horse called Poseidon. It's a great town for equestrian pursuits and is bigger than the others but still tame. Next was  Auckland , NZ's big smoke. Geographically it's huge and the population is well over a million but I only really inhabited the areas immediately surrounding the city center; New Market (upmarket shopping), Parnell (art and restaurants), Downtown (usual chain shops on Queen St/NZs best designers and EDM shops on High St and surrounding area) Ponsonby (bars, cafes and clothing boutiques), Grey Lynn (community based urban living), Kingsland (villas and a hip little strip of various shops) and K Rd (clubs and independent shops). I rapidly and steadily fell off the rails in Auckland but made some great friends and got seriously into music and partying, which is a good thing if you ask me. At the height of my delinquency I was moved to  Nelson  where I got my feet back on the ground and my head down from the clouds to complete high school with honours. As far as small towns go it doesn't get much better than Nelson. There is at least one of everything you need; book stores, music shops, restaurants, clubs (Phat Club), bars (Kaki), cafes (Zippy's) and pubs (The Mean Fiddler). Plus its got sunny weather, great beaches and a friendly atmosphere.   In England, I only dipped in and out of  London  and it's one of the great city's of the world so it would be pointless to furnish it with a detailed description. However my favourite place was Hoxton Square. I lived mostly in  Bristol , which is a fantastic little city with lots of creativity and energy. But unfortunately it thrived on the slave trade and the class system is still alive and well today with Sloane Rangers inhabiting the big houses of Clifton and many African descendants rocking it in St Pauls. Last but not least was  Manchester . It's a cool, modern post-industrial city that's home to some of the best art and ideas to come out of the UK. The Northern Quarter is home to many record shops, clubs and clothing stores. If you head south from the center it's good all the way down through Rushholme, Fallowfield and Withington to Didsbury.   After another 3-year spell in AK, I now live in  Shimobe . It's a tiny mountain town and I don't even live in the busy part. I'm in this kind of stretch of houses near the school that has just a couple of old-fashioned shops with a river running down the middle and mountains on either side. Shimobe itself is famous for onsen (Japanese spa baths) and has a world-class steak house and a superb sushi bar. It's only a five minute drive away but I don't drive.

      Fact: I love large industrial cities, the more depraved the better. I've never been to Detroit but there must be something special about the place considering all the groundbreaking, seminal music that has emerged from there. In case you don't know, I'm talking about stuff like Motown, that little electronic genre called techno, and a small band known as The White Stripes. Manchester has made a similarly impressive contribution to the world: from Northern Soul (which was possibly an English adaptation of Motown anyway) to Joy Division and New Order to UK acid house. It is also the home of paperecordings (which is now online only) and one of the founding DJ/producers, Elliot Eastwick, recently made a film about the similarities between the two cities and their respective sounds. How totally cool. What I'm trying to say is that I think it's fucking fantastic that the Pistons beat the Lakers. I don't much care for baseball or American Football but I've kept an eye on basketball for a number of years, and even bought a terrible Chicago Bulls t-shirt when I was about 13. But the Bulls seem too much like Man U to me, with Michael Jordan being the George Best or Eric Cantona or whatever star you want to name, so I've shyed away from supporting them. A friend of mine said that the Lakers were actually more like Man U but I think they were wrong; they're more like Chelsea. The same friend told me about the last Detroit team that one the title - The Badboys - a while before the finals even got under way, and that attracted me to them even more. So, assuming nobody objects on any serious grounds, I'm now going to start supporting the Pistons in earnest. Not because they won but because they're representatives of some hardcore shit in a flakey world. Of course, initially, I'll just buy a cap and try and catch a game on TV and check the scores in the paper, but one day I'll certainly get to Detroit to watch the team. And Detroit also happens to be home to the serious EDM festival known as Movement, so I'll probably have to go there too. People tell me it's a dangerous city and there's nothing to do but that just makes me want to go more.

      I wasn't born In England near a club and I don't have any family ties to one so I had no choice but to pick one for myself. I'm obviously not much of a glory hunter but people often talk condescendingly about Oasis when I mention which club I support and I'll freely admit that I was introduced to MCFC through a Noel Gallagher quote in the NZ Herald in 1996, in which he told various members of the Board to make him a cup of tea and the Chairman to just fuck off, but my reasoning was a little better than that. Manchester appealed to me because of its long musical tradition and hard-core industrial history and by the time I got to England in '98 I was ready to switch from checking the Premiership results in the papers and watching the highlights on the tele to an all-out declaration of support for one team. I knew I was going to be living there and that I'd probably be able to get tickets to see City play because they were in Division Two at the time. I figured if I started with them while they were at the bottom then by the time they got back up I may have earnt the right to celebrate the fact. And, for some reason, I actually thought that City meant the urban part of the area and United meant the surrounding suburbs, and I'd choose a dirty housing estate over rolling hills any day. I also like the color blue better than red and the North of England better than the South.  Initially I was very shy around proper Manchester born n bred fans but after spending so many hours in the cold watching them "stumble about shooting chances into the Kippax" I decided I had the right to say We and Us, at least to fans of other teams anyway. You don't pay money for that kind of entertainment just because a couple of rock stars are at it. Luckily City made it to the play-off finals against Wigan at Wembley and were promoted to Division One but, unfortunately, it was the same season that United won the treble so the achievement seemed paltry by comparison. In 2000 they were promoted back to the Premiership only to be relegated again in 2001. They didn't mess around in the 01-02 season and won the Divison One title convincingly. Hopefully they'll now stay where they belong in the top flight of English football although this season they've hovered uncomfortably around the bottom of the table.  The City of Manchester Stadium is mint, on the absolute other side of town from MUFC, and in February City beat United 4-1 at home.

      My father is a fisherman and my little brother's father is a keen yachtsman so I've been around boats all my life and love nothing more than being out on the ocean. As everyone knows, NZ is comprised of several islands so there is a lot of water and lot of water sports. We were the first country to win the America's Cup and successfully defend it but then, in '03, we fucked up big time. It was a national disgrace and the impact will no doubt be felt for some time yet. The only possible consolation would be the old saying that if you're going to do something you may as well go all the away, because we didn't just lose; we didn't even really compete. Our boat was shit.

      NZ's national cricket team, led by the might Stephen Fleming. Sometimes they lose badly but right now they are totally in form, which is fucking delightful. The team has a lot of character and not a few class players. There's nothing like the sight of a non-strike batsman all in black leaning on his bat with one leg languidly crossed over the other. Or quality spin bowling. Or sweet reverse sweeps. Especially on a sunny day at Mt Eden with some hot chips, a few beers and a killer hangover. I love cricket and I love The Black Caps.

      Man U are the first thing I ever remember knowing about English football and initially I didn't have such a bad opinion of them because football was an interesting alternative to rugby and the All Blacks, and the people that wore their merchandise were pretty cool too. However it wasn't long before I decided they were kind of like the football equivalent of the All Blacks in the sense that they had fans all over the world that don't know much about the respective sports, other than a few star players from major teams, and aren't likely to ever actually get to Manchester or NZ to watch a home game. That is to say, both clubs attract a disproportionate number of fairly ignorant fair-weather fans.

      Jack Black seems to be everywhere right now but I don't particularly remember ever having heard of him a short while ago; maybe I'd just seen his face. He's very funny in this movie and I couldn't help thinking his character mightn't be far off his real person because he played it so naturally. The premise for the movie is nothing new: inspiring straight rich kids to explore the creative areas of their minds, a la  Dead Poet's Society . But it's a modernized version with rock music at its core and accessories like mobile phones and iBooks apparent in the classroom. I'm so heavily into EDM these days that I forget there are still a whole bunch of people out there who still believe rock to be at the heart of the counter-culture revolution and despair at the sight and sound of MTV. In the bigger scheme of things, rock hasn't been around all that long and yet it became fully mainstream years ago. All forms of music begin in the underground then slowly catch on, cross over, explode and retreat again; some people will always hold true to the original ideal in which it was born while others will jump to the next big thing, and I don't see anything wrong with this. Anyhow , School of Rock  makes highly entertaining lite-viewing. If you want to watch something more intense in the musical vein, try and track down the b&w documentary about Thelonius Monk, the jazz pianist. It's fucking cool.

      I was a little too young to watch his  Twin Peaks  series when it originally aired but I've been suitably impressed by the films I've seen since,  Mulholland Drive ,  Lost Highway  etc, which are beautiful and eerie and interesting to watch. So I was intrigued when my terrific friend James brought a video to my house that had "za suturato sutori" written on it in katakana. He claimed it was a slow David Lynch film about a man on a tractor, and his description wasn't gripping enough to prevent me first watching a Sex Pistols documentary, the start of some dumb MTV style movie and most of  The Wedding Planner  on TV. Finally I put it in the machine and it was a delight from start to finish. Every line of dialogue is meaningful because the characters don't say alot; subtle nuances of emotion conveyed best in a look or expression. The story is lovely but it's also a beautful testament to the elderly and their continuing strength of spirit in the face of physical deterioration. There is a quality conversation about the experience of being WW vets in modern society and the lasting impact that has on their perspective of the world. Incorporated in the plot is also the issue of the state's role in determining who is and isn't fit to care for children and the lasting bonds of family despite superficial differences... What a film!

      This is a French film and I saw it in Japan so there were no subtitles for those parts but they're not too hardcore and I got the gist so everything was fine and dandy. Except the movie's kind of weird. The plot totally centers around 2 women, one an anal middle-aged writer, the other a promiscuous young girl. The action takes place at a house in a quiet French village and involves a little eating, drinking, smoking, fucking and dancing, so they covered their bases well. I'm not sure which parts were real and which weren't and I don't think it matters, it's one of those films you just submit to and come out at the end going, okay, cool. Sometimes I despair that I'm not a straightlaced person with a fully functioning mind that's capable of saying yes and no and start and stop at the right times in all aspects of life from work to the bedroom. But this movie reassured me that it's better to be an interesting fuck up than a dull perfectionist. Maybe. Hopefully.

      It's true that this movie is a bona fide Hollywood blockbuster starring Brad Pitt. However it's still absolutely wondrous. I studied Classics at high school and am aware that it's not an accurate depiction of Homer's masterpiece, but whatever. The story has been used as the basis for so many other works over the years that people should know by now not to expect a faithful rendition and if they happen to be major fans of the original (assuming such a thing exists considering it's antiquity and dubious origins) then perhaps they should refrain from going to see the movie. I can think of few things more tedious right now than listening to such people dissect it because there are so many things that Wolfgang Petersen got right. The film is stunning. And the casting was brilliant. As far as I'm concerned Brad Pitt can do no wrong. He's been in my good books ever since seeing him smoking a bong in  Thelma and Louise  and I loved  Se7en ,  Joe Black ,  Fight Club ,  Snatch  etc as much. The man who played Hector was also excellent and I'd like to think the two could have swapped parts and carried both equally well. And Orlando Bloom as Paris - how charming and cute and hilarious! What a complete flake. It's a tough call to be the woman whose "face hath launched a thousand ships" but Helen was very very beautiful, as was Hector's wife. The only criticsm I would agree with is that everyone does harp on about the immortality of fame a little too much; but then the fact that such a story has once again been used as the basis for something magnificent proves that the tale of their deeds has indeed been told for thousands of years and will now be known to the young and dumb everywhere for at least another few to come. Personally, I'd love to see a film adaptation of Shakespeare's  Troilus and Cressida .

      Riding the endless wave of all things '80s, Party Monster is an unusual film that left me feeling amused and repulsed in equal measure. Starring Macauley Culkin and Seth Green, with a requisite appearance from Chloe Sevigny, the characters are proudly superficial and so camp that the acting sometimes seems completely wooden. But then I believe that might be the point. The plot is an extreme version of the small town misfit wanting to prove himself in the big city, the boy having been sexually abused and looking to one of NYs trust-fund party queens for advice as to how to be fabulous. Cue some DiY party mayhem followed rapidly by hardcore drug addiction to anything that can be snorted, ie, ketamine, coke and heroin. This means we are spared the classic junkie shots of needles going into arms though we later see both main characters in hospital being fed by a drip. I'm not a huge fan of crazy drag costumes but there are some superb moments full of beautiful colors and banging tunes. There are also some wonderful tips offered to club-kid aspirants and, considering the film is based on a true story, they must have worked - assuming of course that getting infamous in a short lived microworld is your thing. Just remember: if all else fails, play techno...

      I guess I'm in a reasonably qualified position to discuss this film because I live in Japan and spend quite a lot of time in Tokyo; plus I'm a similar age to Scarlett's character, though not married to a famous photographer. And I do really like the film. I think it's beautifully shot and really captures that beguiling, bewildering feeling you get when you are brought into contact with someone that you end up feeling deeply for but can't really be with, now or ever. The whole isolation thing is relevant too of course and the whole what the hell am I doing, how did it come to this, where do I go from here confusion was perfectly illustrated in the scenes where she's sitting on the windowsill and he's sitting on his bed. But, however, I do have one small criticism. I just don't think that a director as sophisticated and sensitive as Sophia Coppola needed to resort to stereotypical shots of Murray dwarfing Japanese in an elevator, or the director screaming at him, or everyone deferentially ushering him everywhere. I don't know; I'm not famous or particularly tall so maybe that is how it is for people like him but the Japanese aren't actually all that short and they're quite capable of being polite and attentive without being over-the-top obsequious. I saw the film twice, once on DVD and once at Rise, an arthouse cinema in Shibuya. The first time everyone fell asleep around me. The second time nobody laughed once. Maybe I'm developing a strong affection for the Japanese people so I feel moved to defend them, but maybe certain aspects of the film were in fact unnecessarily cliche. I loved it all the same. SJ's character was gorgeous and human, and the girl that was supposed to be CD was hilarious.

      Starring the sexy Vince Vaughn and a few other great men I can't remember the name of, this film is hilarious. One of them comes home to discover his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, watching porn and waiting for two others to emerge from the bathroom for a gangbang. They split up and he moves into a house which is subsequently zoned for university use only, so, following the success of a party they had to celebrate his release back into the wild, they decide to establish a fraternity. Much fun and chaos ensues with some great one liners along the way. The whole movie is well scripted and well acted so the slightly stupied idea actually works really well.

      This is a hella strange film from the '70s. It's hard to say exactly why it's so strange without giving the plot away and it would be a shame to do so because it builds eerily along to a climax which isn't entirely unexpected but is perfectly executed to give you the maximum creeps. It stars Mia Farrow, who is delightful as Rosemary, and a bunch of other characters who are irritating and charming by turns. The setting is New York in the mid '60s so some of the fashion is excellent, especially in the little party scene. Polansky, the director, did well to keep the soundtrack to a minimum so that the audience is left to feel how they want without soaring strings or dark drums indicating when we are supposed to be moved or apprehensive. Having said that, Fur Alise tinkles intermittently throughout the entire film.

      New York is the original city that never sleeps but from what I can gather various NYC authorities are slowly strangling the place in their efforts to make it 100% safe and squeaky clean, while Tokyo seems to be largely left to its own devices. There&nbsp;is a&nbsp;small police box in every&nbsp;district but I don't think I've ever seen a policeman -&nbsp;maybe they're all undercover? Anyhow, it's true that the nights get increasingly chaotic as the week progresses but there was a lovely buzz about the place on an ordinary Tuesday too. We began with cocktails and champagne up at the Sky Bar of the Keiyo Plaza Hotel in Shinjuku then made our way to Shibuya where we had dinner at Elephant, a big pan-Asian restaurant with a Buddhist theme. Many restaurants do good set-menu deals and&nbsp;for a little more you can&nbsp;drink as much as you want&nbsp;too (nomihodai), which&nbsp;is what we did there.&nbsp;I then went and met a friend of mine and he took me to his friend's bar. There must be hundreds of similar places around the city but you really need to be shown them by someone who knows because they're usually buried in a basement with an anonymous door. The bar was small with banging music, a genki proprietor and interesting decor. Very enjoying time. Then to Hachi Aoyama, a 4-storied club built next to a massive highway. We drank more shochu, ate a little yakitori and generally traipsed around. The owners and staff were excellent examples of modern Japanese men: unselfconsciously eccentric. Finally - drunkenly and pointlessly - I went to Yellow to find the last of my friends were just leaving. They have a hip hop/R&amp;B night on Tuesdays and it wasn't really up my street at all. But it was better than the bars I went to after, where people continued to drink and dance to awful Eurotrash or gangsta beats that sounded surprisingly good after a few shots of vodka. At least I now know for myself that Roppongi is hideous rather than just taking other people's word for it. Back to the hotel at 6, destined to be hungover for&nbsp;two days. The point of the story? Monday to Sunday, Tokyo's open for business.

      I'm not sure if it's a totally subjective thing based on the fact I find both of them totally hot but I'm convinced Iz & Diz are the best house DJs on the planet. I've heard Joshua/Iz spin in NZ (May 03), Tokyo (Feb 04) and SF (May 04) at both banging club parties and small bars and he impressed me every time, so I was very excited about checking his DJ/production partner in crime. Both appeared courtesy of Solid, a promotion team that hails from Canada and includes DJ Marshall, who spins at all their gigs. The fact that the pair played at the same venue meant it was easy to compare them though Diz got the better position in that the decks were shifted to a space under the mezzanine - just a few steps up from the dancefloor - while Iz was way up in the DJ booth that's level with it. I'm sure they're well aware of their own idiosyncratic differences but Iz and Diz essentially sounded the same to me, which is obviously why they work well together. On the night in question, Diz played a mix of new and old, beautiful and edgy, soulful and techy: every kind of house is house is house that falls into the category called quality. He also partied with the crowd while the other DJs spun, making people extra responsive to his own set. Of course, once again, I got a little too tipsy etc and misinterpreted certain events but that seems to be a requisite part of my clubbing experience; the drama will only end when I stop getting messed up and allow my brain to see and hear clearly. Even so, an excellent night passed with a fantastic bunch of people and lots of solid dancing action. I only wish I was more of a trainspotting type because Diz played a couple of tracks that momentarily broke my heart they were so damn deep.

      Derrick L Carter is a big beautiful black man from Chicago and he's one of the world's best and most famous underground house DJs. For one reason or another this was the first time I've heard him spin and he was definitely good though I got a little lost in the party and forgot about the music sometimes because, quite simply, it wasn't loud enough. Like Kenny Hawkes, Carter was supported by a local DJ called Remi and I can't say I particularly rate him though I don't really know why. He played some solid house with a few of Carter's classics like Where U At? thrown in for good measure. But it was instantly apparent when Derrick himself had taken control. Apparently the Phazon system at Womb is not what it used to be and when you're right out in the center of the mighty dancefloor you certainly feel immersed in it but it was perhaps a little dull and flat around the edges of the room. Anyhow, Mr Carter played relentlessly good house music for 5 hours until he was finally removed from the decks after three encores with lights on and off every time, much to the obvious chagrin of the Womb crew who like to shut things down at the early hour of 5am. Carter was apparently their first major house act and they can't have been disappointed with their choice of DJ nor the attendance, though the place didn't totally fill up till around 1:30.  They usually host dnb, techno and progressive parties that tend to attract a multitude of ravers regardless of who's playing, often because they're associated with influential clubbing brands like Renaissance or Global Underground. The overall profile of house music just doesn't seem to be as high as it's more epic counterparts though I think the deeper styles are better suited to smaller clubs anyway, the music being altogether more subtle and sexy. As far as I'm concerned it's a bit of a catch-22 because only the bigger clubs can afford to book the biggest DJs so in a city like Tokyo we have to go there to see them, while many other equally competent DJs are destined to keep rocking the smaller clubs in relative obscurity until someone takes a gamble and exposes them to people outside the intelligent underground... after which we won't be able to hear them play at intimate venues unless we catch them in their home town or at some kind of secret/ private/ pre/ post party.  After the gig I went to a fantastic little bar in East Shibuya called Red. The place was packed with a mixture of ageing gaijin (foreigners) and young Japanese all getting down to some quality house, as if to prove my point. What a fucking impact Carter's bumping chunky naughty tunes would have made in such a place! And then I went to the mad afterhours party at Maniac Love in Aoyama and, again, his set would have worked a treat in the tighter environment.  [For the record, I then went to Lost in Translation with an American boy I met at the party, had Thai and beer for lunch, passed out on the train and finally ended up at my friends birthday party, where I drank Long Island Iced Teas till late that night].

      There is some very unusual use of the "Engrish" language in Japan so it's possible the name refers to someone's penchant for almonds and cashews but it seems more likely that they're familiar with the fact we use the word nuts to mean crazy/mad/mental, because the club is all of these things. For a start, the queue was massive. My friend and I decided to go for a drink in a nearby bar on the assumption that it would be shorter by the time we got out but instead it had doubled. We didn't really have any grounds on which to claim VIP status and our Japanese definitely wasn't up to blagging it so we were debating going elsewhere. But the people at the back of the queue enthusiastically convinced us that it was worth waiting as the talent that night was very, very famous. I had previously checked the listings and didn't recognise any names so presumably they are Big in Japan, that oft used phrase to indicate that something should be considered cool. In fact the only information I gained from the website was that the genre was Good Beats, but we decided to stay anyway. I went to a conbeni (convenience store) for some beer and an hour and a few Beatles songs later we were finally inside.  The club has got industrial decor but is infinitely smaller than your average factory and in some parts my tall friend had to duck down. The dancefloor has the usual bank of DJ equipment at one end and complicated looking sound gear at the other. The system was huge and sounded serious if you danced on this stage kind of thing that stood between the main stack of speakers. And even if you didn't want to dance on the thing you still had to climb over it to get from the back of the room to the middle, or else go around a perilous corridor crowded with people just hanging out. I was constantly falling over because there were so many unseen steps or people sitting on the floor. At the end of this corridor is the bathrooms and for such a small club they were well equipped but we still had to wait a while because the place was rammed.   On the other side of the dancefloor is an area with the bar in the center and seated areas at either end. The wall between the bar and dancefloor is a one-way mirror but I can't actually remember who could see who. There were only two bar staff working and they were fun to look at but I'd rather not have had so much time to do so. At both ends of the room the roof is really low to allow for two small lounge spaces upstairs; one public, one private. The open area had twin Vestax and a laptop just sitting there all ready to go but nobody was using them. The VIP just had a few sofas and hot ladies.  "Good Beats" is actually a very accurate description of the music policy that night. When we arrived it was quality Hip Hop and this morphed into some decent RnB and dirty DnB, some amusing gangsta rap, a brief crazy performance by some live MCs, and everything in between. To give you an indication of the calibre of their international guests, it was their third birthday party the following week and they had DJ Spinna playing a house set on the Friday and a hip hop set on the Saturday. In other words, pure class. And did I mention the crowd was at least 80% female? Now that's nuts.

      The major reason I went to San Franciso was to party. I think I did a reasonable job of it but sometimes I got a little distracted or tired so didn't get to quite as many venues as I would have liked. In a city where there's so much to do, you've got to stay focused if you want to get everything done and I definitely lost my way a little here and there. But I'll definitely go back and maybe even try and catch some of its daytime features too. If you're planning on going, check&nbsp; urlLink http://www.sfstation.com &nbsp;They cover everything but the club guide is exceptional.    Night 1: First up on the Wednesday was a party called  Quool  at  111 Minna , an art gallery in the center of town. Hosted by DJs Spesh and Jondi (maybe), the party starts at 5 and goes till 10 every week and I thought the concept and space were brilliant. However, at first, the party seemed kind of gay (in the non-homosexual sense) with pounding tunes ringing out over an empty dancefloor and everyone doing their best to out-talk each other in the other part of the building. But gradually the place filled up and I made friends with a bunch of lovely men who took me outside and got me stoned (it was ok to smoke just across the street from the doormen). The party took on new meaning after that and I saw it for what it is: a fantastic meeting ground for people wanting to go a little wild in the early evening of a weekday. A nice man drove me to the next place I wanted to go, which was a party called  Shizzam Jizzam  at  Arrow Bar . Maybe I got my wires crossed because I was expecting acid house and they were playing rock n roll, but that in itself was cool because I'd never heard the likes of Mother's Little Helper played on a live PA before. However I leap ahead of myself. Before I found the bar I accidentally smoked some crack down an alley with this black chick who had asked me if I wanted to smoke a little weed. I wasn't too happy when I found my lungs lined with plastic but I wasn't exactly furious either; though my companion decided to ditch me at this point. He pleaded me to be sensible as he took off down the street but I assured him I was in no such mood. After that, by the grace of God, I spent a while wandering round in the armpit of SF being misguided by various dodgy pimps and hustlers away from my destination. Fortunately, along the way, I passed  Anu Bar  where there was a rocking little house party called  Satellite  in full effect so I went back there after having a couple at Arrow. I was then adopted by a charming man who bought me topshelf vodka/sodas all night. I don't recall how I got back to my hotel that night.   Night 2: I showed up early to hear/see  The Rapture  and  Black Rebel Motorcycle Club  perform so I had to sit through a mundane hardrock act to begin with but got talking to the merchandise girl, who I'd met the night before, and that passed the time. The Rapture played first and were fantastic. On the album, I get a little annoyed with the pitch of his voice but he had such an adorable stage presence that I didn't mind his occasional screeches at all. Also, I didn't realize that another band member sung a lot of the time too. The entire band was really busy with the drummer playing conventional drums or working a drum machine, the singer singing or playing guitar and generally being entertaining and engaging with a really raw, vulnerable performance, and the other guy playing the keyboard or synth or whatever plus the sax and a miked up stick banging thing (that obviously has a much better name than that). Maybe there was a fourth person? Whatever, they were great and their set took you up and down, fast and slow through their album and other songs. Next up was BRMC. And I may as well mention that in between bands the sound guys played some great tunes, from DJ Shadow to The Stones to crazy disco techno and funky house. One of the singers of Black Rebel came out and sat right of stage on his own and played a couple of new songs with an acoustic guitar, one of which was called Complicated Situation and was really beautiful. Then the other singer came out and took to the other side and added some bass, then finally the drummer. So they looked like a really equal band and shared singing duties and rocked it, all in black. Fortunately for me they played my favorite tracks quite soon (the first and last ones on their latest album) and I was itching to get to my first proper nightclub so I left early.  The End Up  had a party called  iMixed  on that night, possibly referencing iPods and stuff but I don't know if any of that was going down or not. I also didn't recognize any of the names on the bill but I think it's safe to assume that in a city like SF many of the DJs would have been spinning for well over 10 years by now, famous or not. The music was great and I loved the club, which seemed custom built for fun times. I also quickly made some friends and ended up going back to a production studio in SOMA with a promoter who I'd met the day before at Minna. A few other people turned up, to his displeasure, but it meant a quiet little party of music and drugs proceeded till the following morning.   Night 3: I should have gone and checked out Mighty, a modern art gallery/club on the other side of the Mission that has an early party from 5-10pm on Fridays. But I was feeling a little dodgy and instead called up a guy I'd met the previous night to go out for dinner. He came and got me and we went over to Oakland and hung out at an all-American diner that was annexed to a casino then went back to his house, where I witnessed a heated debate about the war on Iraq and America's role as the current world superpower. The participants included my friend, who was a black ex-marine, his sexy hispanic roommate and their skinny white friend, who was a member of the US army at that time. For the record, there was a gun and some coke on the table between them and hip hop blaring in the background, and outside there was a ghetto-hawk searching the neighbourhood for some kind of criminal. I was pleased in my time in SF to encounter way more intelligent anti-Bush opinions than otherwise but that night I got the full scope. Finally I got taken back to the city and dropped off at a club called  Mezzanine  where 2ManyDJs were playing. Unfortunately I'd missed the start of the party when one of the hosts, DJ Solar, had played and by the time I got there it was all about fucking breaks and electroclash or whatever the hell it is and so I'd almost run out of patience by the time the main act came on. They played a few tunes I knew, including a mix of Inner City's Good Life, and although they were probably just getting warmed up and likely to take the crowd on a fun ride through electronica's past and present, I split. Just down the street was  Club 6 , where East Coast Boogiemen were playing, so I went there. I loved the club and the music was superb: deep, dark, funky, interesting, fresh house music. I think maybe Jonene played first but I'm not sure. There wasn't a huge crowd and I should have gone up the road to another club called  DNA , to a weekly house party called  Remedy  where people like Kaskade are resident, but I didn't. Oh well. Had a great time anyway and just as I was leaving I ran into some wealthy, young guys I'd met earlier and they gave me a ride home and their number so as to meet up the following night.   Night 4: I took a cab out to the guy's friend's house and we had a few drinks and got a little geared up to hit  Ruby Skye  where Doc Martin was playing. The club was nominated for the Dancestar awards as one of the top five in the US so I suspected it might be a little dodgy but went along anyway because I love the Doc. He was excellent, playing a rumbling mix of deep, techy, acid house with a few classics thrown in for good measure. And the venue is beautiful with throbbing sound, but just not very cool. It's all about the money and the crowd were kind of wack and there were some very dodgy chicks hired to dance on podiums amidst other such superclub trappings. Although I wanted to hear Doc's set I was impatient to go back to Club 6 where the party  Get Underground  was celebrating its second birthday. I probably should have nipped up the road to the End Up and checked out  Foundation  too, the monthly party thrown by Miguel migs and featuring Julias Papp and Jay-J, but I didn't because I was too busy getting stoned with a married couple in the wicked shady lounge that's behind one of the dancefloor's walls. They asked me back to their house for some sex, coke and valium and I thought it sounded great but my friend said it was terrible idea so I didn't go.   Day 5: The End Up is open nearly all weekend but the gig changes at various times. On Saturday they have a day party that runs from 6am-12pm and on Sunday  T-Power  runs from 6am-8pm, then swtiches to Devotion. It was a lovely space to hang out and after a couple of hours wandering round and drinking beer I settled in with a group of people who were really friendly and kept introducng me to people. The music was quality house at first, then it switched briefly to dirty breaks, then back to good house, then finished with some fairly terrible gospel-style vocal house that drove me away. The numbers ebbed and flowed throughout the day with the people who had been out all night dropping off while other groups from various afterparties kept showing up and then more people would come along having been home for some sleep first. By around 7 it was a jumping party with a full dancefloor and a noisy crowd out in the garden.  Night 5: It was the first night that the party  Bionic  was at a DJ bar called Pink in the SOMA/Mission area, rather than at The Top on Haight St where it had been for about six years. Allegedly they moved because the sound system is better and because they can now stay open till 4am instead of 2, but on that night they shut early because it was so quiet. I've no doubt it will pick up though because one of the hosts, Joshua, plays/produces some of the best music around and I assume they have a loyal following who just took a night off or whatever. I was feeling a little dodgy by that time and didn't really know what to do with myself so I didn't stray far from the dancefloor. The music was flawless, courtesy of J and the other original founder, Mark E Quark.   Night 6: After sleeping all day and eating some delicious authentic tacos (soft tortilla kind of wraps not hard shells) with a friend of a friend, I was ready to party again. The Green Gorrila Lounge people throw a weekly Monday event called  High Heels  at a wicked little DJ bar called  Milk , on upper Haight St. The May flyer featured a camp 50s style woman bent over in some sexy heels and fishnets so I was expecting the place to be full of hot ladies rocking the latest Jimmy Choos. But it wasn't, although I wore some brand new hot pink numbers that made dancing a rather awkward phenomena until I got a little drunk. The music was right on target and the hosts were super nice and friendly and I got drinking with this random guy who runs an upmarket strip club but allegedly frequents places like Milk to get away from all the female ego. Later on we shared some MDMA and you'd have to be a loser not to have had a good time in those circumstances. Even better, a friend from the previous day showed up and I left with him to go to his friend's Moroccan restaurant in the Castro district, where people were partying all night with the assitance of serious quantities of cocaine. I must have been a little high by this point, and not just because of the heels, because I offered to DJ so our mad host wouldn't have to climb a dodgy ladder to get to the decks every time a record finished. There was vinyl stashed absolutely everywhere and I'm sure some of it was brilliant but everything was in the wrong sleeves and it was dark and a vital part of the headphones was missing. I had fun mixing all kinds of shit into, over and out of a dirty Grayhound bassline. Hours later, I should have left with my friend and gone somewhere glamourous for breakfast or something but instead I stayed until the atmosphere turned sour and by the time my cab came I was dying to leave.   Night 7: I went round to the studio I'd been at on Thursday and there wasn't exactly a party going on but a bit of drinking and drugging and dancing went down after we'd been and got some more quality Mexican food in the Mission and then had a couple of drinks at two bars on lively Polk St,  Big Foot  and  The Hemlock . The first had a DJ playing awful funk or soul or something and the second was playing Joy Division. Class.   Night 8: Should have. Should have. Should have. It's a phrase to ruin a girl's sanity.  The Top  has a good house party every Wednesday and I hadn't been there because Bionic had been shifted to Pink, but I didn't go that night either. Instead I went up to  Harry Denton's Starlight Lounge , which is a scenester's bar on the top of a grand hotel in the center of town. I only went because this gorgeous girl had given me her card the previous week and luckily I didn't have to wait or pay, and I didn't stay long. So it wasn't exactly a fitting final destination for my time in in San Franciso.

      If you read the credits on the cover of Mark Farina's album you'll see that Yellow is one of the soundsystems he thanks. Likewise, they obviously appreciate his ability because he was given sole command of the premises for over 9 hours. Perhaps it was written in the fine Japanese print on the flyer but I was seriously surprised to learn that Farina was already playing when I arrived at the club at about 10.45. And I was delighted to discover that there would be no support DJs on the night, either in the main room or the separate upstairs lounge bar. Instead the whole of Yellow's sprawling, industrial space would be treated to whatever one of the world's favorite DJs chose to play, all night. Known as much for his modern Mushroom Jazz stylings as his inimitable brand of deep house, I was expecting Farina to begin with a couple of hours of random beats - maybe a bit of hip hop, funk, disco or electro type stuff - and slowly make his way through the genres until he reached house proper. But he got started on the 4/4 tip immediately and worked the ever-growing crowd with a captivating, sometimes quirky, sometimes twisted, sometimes beautiful selection that peaked at around 4 when he dropped into an hour or two of tougher crunchy house that had the dance floor totally hypnotized. The last couple of hours were still super tight but more varied in tempo and style and conducive to a messy finale.  Space-Lab Yellow is one of Tokyo's most established clubs and hosts many of the biggest underground acts to grace these shores. The sound is phat and the people friendly. In the main room there's a steel staircase which spirals up to a small area that overlooks the dancefloor below and, half-way up, you can look through the metal caging down into the DJ booth. Whenever I saw Farina he was busy as hell: flicking through an enormous case of CD-Rs or a bag of records, mixing, blending, blending, mixing, and dancing his ass off. I'm guessing he was doing that when I wasn't watching him too. It was fucking impressive though unfortunately I imbibed too much stuff and don't remember it very well.

      Oh dear. This was the name of my 21st birthday party, for which I had flyers professionally designed and printed and everything. We also hired a big PA but my dumb friends took it away the night before&nbsp;to another party and were late getting back and all the settings were fucked. Also, for some reason they got one of our friends to spin first and he plays hip hop and happy house, which aint my thing at all. So my other mate got on pretty quick and started knocking out some good deep, dark house but the music/system was only one of the problems. For some reason my plan was to have about 15 of my friends and family go to a lovely Japanese restaurant before the party. We had a case of Moet and other beverages to drink and everyone got slaughtered but I didn't organize much booze for back at our place after. True, I lived in an enormous warehouse with 5 other people at the time and, true, many people were expected to turn up so it would've been hard to provide for everyone. But my friend's boyfriend worked for one of the key liquor companies in NZ and when he showed up I was only able to offer him some warm, second-rate beer. How embarrassing. If this still isn't sounding so bad then you might like to consider the fact that I hadn't been to sleep since the previous night and had been drinking etc all day. It had been a fantastic night at dirty old Calibre and I was partying with two of my more glamourous friends and one of the then-owners, upon whom I promptly developed a platonic crush. I stayed in touch with my family and friends all day and just tried not to worry about anything... But, really, it did turn out to be a disaster. There was a moment when I was just like Meg Ryan in  The Doors  film when she burns the duck: trivial matters assuming mammoth significance. I was fucking wasted, and it was a fucking waste of an opportunity to have a quality clubbing session in a private venue. Oh well.

      I thought&nbsp;this might be a good way to chart my major ups and downs throughout the years but after writing it I see that&nbsp;I've just gone increasingly downhill, or uphill depending on your view of things.&nbsp;Let's hope that I finally learn from my many, many mistakes come NYE 04/05.   &nbsp;  93/94: Whangamata, NZ   First NYE away from my family, with my friends.&nbsp;Stayed with my friend's liberal family at a hired batch just back from the beach, just down from the Surf Club. Much good eating and drinking was done at home and much silliness was done away from home - boys, pot and dodgy expeditions.&nbsp; &nbsp;   94/95: Cooks Beach/Whangamata, NZ   Got into an argument with a friend about something at Cooks and that prompted me to split&nbsp;to Whanga, where I hadn't organized anywhere to stay. Hung out at a friend's place by day and went wandering by night. Drank way, way too much and had some crazy adventures but was also a disgusting mess - mentally and physically. Eventually my dad came and got me and drove me to Wellington so I could go to the family place in the Marlborough Sounds; felt like being sent to a rehab center.&nbsp; &nbsp;   95/96: Bay of Islands/ Calibre, NZ   I went away with some friends&nbsp;to&nbsp;go canping up north but it rained so we stayed at someone's house and drank a lot. I accidentally broke something&nbsp;of sentimental value to my friend and he punched me, so then I had a black eye as well as no hair.&nbsp;After that we relocated to our&nbsp;other friends' &nbsp;place where some heavy drinking went down before me and one friend decided to get the hell back to AK. Went down Calibre for The Breakz drum n bass party with much makeup on face.&nbsp; &nbsp;   97/98: The Gathering, Nelson ,NZ   Went camping with some friends and took a load of acid. Spent a lot of time in the house tent, where there were mini trampolines built into the ground to bounce up and down on. Salmonella Dub rocked it in the beats tent one night.&nbsp;I found&nbsp;a lovely little chill spot in the forest somewhere and ate some pancakes and ice cream.; very cold at night and very hot by day - that's about all I remember.&nbsp; &nbsp;   98/99: Fat City @ The Roadhouse, Manchester, England   I had just moved to Manchester from Bristol, where I'd met my then-boyfriend,&nbsp;and&nbsp;he was back&nbsp;up &nbsp;in the area for Christmas so we went to this together. The music was fucking excellent courtesy of Mark Rae and company - can't remember exactly who else was on the bill - and The Roadhouse is an intimate venue&nbsp;that's perfect&nbsp;for a partying.&nbsp; &nbsp;   99/00: Pauanui, NZ   Had just got back to NZ with my English boyfriend and was very disorientated, especially because the pot&nbsp;seemed insanely strong and all my friends were suddenly popping pills and doing speed. It rained so camping was a mess, but the party was inside at a friend's place and fairly fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;   00/01: Nice n Urlich, Auckland, NZ   A friend organized a room up at The Metropolis so&nbsp;there was&nbsp;a pre-party with everyone&nbsp;looking hot. We all hit the Winter Gardens in good form though I'd been dumb and not hidden the&nbsp;drugs I had on me and&nbsp;would've been caught out had I not took the initiative to&nbsp;declare some prescription drugs before they searched for any others, which were in the&nbsp;same purse.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a multi-ticket to NnU, the drum n bass party at The Town Hall (Digital?) and whatever was on&nbsp;at The Aotea Center,&nbsp; so I didn't stay long in any one place. There's no doubt Mr Keys and Mr Urlich know how to throw a party&nbsp;and theirs was the most fun.&nbsp;I'd managed not to drink much all night but back at the hotel I took to Heinekin with a vengeance and ended up going to an afterparty by myself to hear some friends spin, but passed out before they started.&nbsp; &nbsp;   01/02: Up North, NZ   Went with some friends to a lovely house on some cliffs a couple of hours north of Auckland somewhere. Much fine eating, drinking and - in my case - drugging. As usual, I got a little out of order and accidentally offended one of my best friends, which sucked. A hot hot man I liked arrived late after he'd got out of order on his family's boat down Auckland way, so we hooked up.&nbsp;There was excellent music&nbsp;all week and much good conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   02/03: Inland Nights @&nbsp;Calibre, Auckland, NZ   Went to a pre-party at a friend's friends' place in Piha. Ate lovely food and got twisted as the sun went down. Hit the&nbsp;club just&nbsp;after midnight (maybe) after a fun drive into town, but&nbsp;then it&nbsp;all went a bit Pete Tong.&nbsp;Got terribly messed up and upset about this man I knew didn't even like me in the first place - stupid. Don't even remember how the lads' set was: a vacuum cleaner probably would've sounded sweet in the state I was in. Very hungover and depressed for days after.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   03/04: Hat Rin Beach, Ko Pha Ngan, Thailand   Smoked some opium and pot and ate a magic omelette in the afternoon at Haad Yao Beach then&nbsp;met up with some of my new mates in the early evening and caught a cab with them to Hat Rin. Tracked down some valium and codeine at the chemists then barely ate dinner at a&nbsp;nice restaurant with a whole bunch of chill people, drinking Long Island Iced Teas. Hit the beach at about 10, did a quick circuit to check the situation and promptly decided the best bars were right next to each other - one with house&nbsp;and the other with drum n bass, so mostly stayed&nbsp;in that vicinity apart from quick tours up and down the shortish shoreline. Found some E and a place that sold&nbsp;shroom shakes and&nbsp;spent the night oscillating wildly between high&nbsp;energy and&nbsp;total lethargy (I was still very lame from my x-mas day accident, hence all the pain relief).&nbsp;Met a random American and went to his bungalow overlooking the ocean and smoked some pot. Lost my friends, found them again, then lost them and found a charming madhatter from England. Beautiful sunrise, after which all the nutters came out of the clubs and onto the beach to play.&nbsp;At around 10am we went to the hi-energy/proggy club and&nbsp;knocked back some Thai Red Bull &amp; vodkas, then caught a cab back to my beach&nbsp;to&nbsp;smoke some opium in my bungalow. Yes, people who&nbsp;go on about&nbsp;drugs and alcohol all the time&nbsp;can be very dull indeed but I think it's necessary in this case to convey just how muthafuckin&nbsp;out of it&nbsp;I was&nbsp;that night. FYI, I was wearing an orange Playboy haltertop and kind of behaved accordingly: naughty girl.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Like San Francisco, I went to Chicago to take a break from Japan in a famously cool English-speaking city. But mainly I went there for house music. As someone said, it's simply not possible that everyone involved in the current scene could have been around in the halcyon days of The Warehouse because of sheer numbers and also because it was mainly a gay black scene; and I didn't expect them to have been. However, I encountered a lot of people who were totally unaware of their city's role in EDM history and this I did find surprising. Many had never heard of The Warehouse at all and most were unable to tell me exactly where it had been in either of its incarnations. One person asked me what kind of music we were listening to (it was DJ Heather playing house). Another asked me what kind of house I was looking for, as in property. On the whole, though, I encountered industry people who were intelligent and fun and generous, and I learnt a great deal about the place and people that spawned the music called house. If you read  Last Night a DJ Saved My Life  you'll find that back in the day the word "house" was generally used as an adjective to describe something that was currently on. No-one I spoke to of that generation was able to confirm this but I think it's a good point anyway: the beauty of house (and other forms of EDM) is the fact that it mutates and absorbs and changes and reflects and grows like life itself. I don't personally really enjoy listening to any of the older styles for long periods of time - from disco to acid to rave to 90s style whatever. It would've been incredible to hear it all when it was brand new and the respective styles of venue were new, and I'm all for DJs cutting up styles with some references to the past, but I find it depressing when the music isn't generally up to speed. Most people will agree that house is house - period - while others have a particular definition of what house is based on whatever era it was that they most actively participated in the cause. For many older Chicagoans, this seemed to equate to the gospel/diva style vocal house that most clearly conveys the spiritual nature of the music. For me, it's what's happening now. I asked a lot of people what they thought about the current state of affairs in Chicago and the general consensus was that they're on their way out of a fairly poor period that began a few years ago. I was unable to find a comprehensive online guide to the city to rival San Francisco's sfstation.com but for some insight and information check:  urlLink http://www.music-101.com  ,  urlLink http://www.chicagogroove.com  and  urlLink http://grooveparlor.com    Thursday: Smart Bar's 22nd Birthday .  The party featured DJ Heather and Miles Maeda. Brad Owen kicked things off with a beautiful set and then introduced me to bunch of cool peepz. Much fun ensued.  Friday: Very hungover and jetlagged. Not very keen about going out but I got in a cab and went up to check either Crobar (for Felix da Housecat) or Zentra (for Yousef). They're just around the corner from each other but both had lines of people that I wasn't desperate to join so I jumped right back in a cab and went home.  Saturday: Chicago Underground Sound loft party. It was a beautiful venue with a fantastic view of the skyline and, although the party was fairly quiet all night, I had a good time with some of the people I'd met on Thursday night.  Stacey Kidd spun a deep set and Paul Johnson arrived late to play last but his set was cut short by fighting outside. Everyone was splitting because some people were apparently coming back with guns and Paul invited me to go with him and his boys; there was blood on the steps when we left. It was the first time I've seen thuggish/gangsta type people and behavior at a house party (rather than hip hop) but supposedly it's not unheard of in Chicago.  Sunday: Day Ra @ Iggy's. It was a beautiful day and I went along to Iggy's to introduce myself to the lovely Arman of Music-101, who I'd contacted some months previous. People were friendly, tunes were good - nice time had by all.  Monday: House Arrest @ Zentra / Boom Boom Room @ Green Dolphin.  Zentra  was quiet when I arrived so I sat down with some guys then went to  Green Dolphin  for a while, which was slowly building into a fun party. When I got back to  Zentra  Diz was spinning, followed by Derrick Carter, and there were a few more people in the club but it was still pretty chill.  Tuesday: Industry Night @ Slick's / House @ Big Wig. I arrived way early at  Slick's  and hung out for a while then went round the corner to  Big Wig , where Gene Farris had held a residency until very recently. His replacement was playing some solid house and the club was lovely, though empty. Back at  Slick's , Diz and Frique spun some good tunes and the party got big as the night wore on.  Wednesday: Silk Hurley @ Grant Park / Moonshine / Tini Martini / DnB @ Bigwig / 3 Degrees @ Zentra. Chicago's  Grant Park  has been host to formal Dancing in the Park for a number of years now but this was the first year they incorporated a DJ element (and on the flyers it specified that there wouldn't be dance classes at these events). Apparently the key organizer decided if Detroit could hold a festival on the strength of their techno then Chicago could hold parties on the strength of its house; about time. So Diz and Derrick kicked the series off some weeks ago and Frankie Knuckles will finish it off in a few weeks on Frankie Knuckles Day, when they will also open an honorary Frankie Knuckles Way where The Warehouse was located. The evening I went, Skip played first and Silk Hurley finished things off. He played an excellent mix of old school vocal house, acid house, disco, funk as well as some more recent pop anthems. The crowd was very mixed with beautiful older black women rocking some hot fashion and plenty of kids running around in amidst the usual mash of dancing folk. Some friends commented that more South Siders had shown up than was usual, and it's a reflection on Chicago that you can still pick where people are likely to live within the city depending on their racial/socioeconomic background. Anyhow, the party was rocking. I then went to my friend's place and we hung out a while before going to  Moonshine . Unfortunately none of us knew Moonshine is a restuarant and the afterparty starts right after the party in the park so we missed Johnny Fiasco's set. At  Tini Martini , Lady D played some good tracks including PJ's latest catchy tune about a hot girl that looks better than Britney... Then I went by myself to  Big Wig  to hear some drum n bass but it was the worst kind of dnb party as far as I'm concerned - hard, angry music and a small intense crowd. Finally I went to  Zentra . 3 Degrees is a members only weekly party for a global network of househeads; a guy I met the previous night said I'd be okay to go and they let me in no problem. People had said the party had had its day but I found a club full of happy people dancing to quality music so I have no complaints whatsoever.  Thursday: KRS 1 @ Funky Buddha / Benefit Gig @ Smart Bar. I wanted to check  Funky Buddha  but I wasn't all that bothered about KRS so I stayed a while, had a few drinks, checked the opening act (who had a heavy number about being from "the bricks") then I left as soon as KRS came on, which was probably very stupid but nevermind.  Smart Bar  was holding a charity party for a woman who's got cancer and the line-up included Monna, Lady D, Heather, Colette and Diz. I was most impressed with Colette: I knew she sung over tracks in a beautiful feminine voice so I was expecting her set to be quite fluffy, but it wasn't. She played some fat, funky, driving house and only sang over it a little. As I was leaving the party I met some friendly guys and went back to their place way up in north Chicago somewhere for some tunes etc.  Friday: Dantes / Peach Fuzz @ Dark Room / Smooth Grooves @ Sonoteque / James Zabiela @ Sound Bar/ Acid House @ Smart Bar. The guys I'd met the previous night had tipped me off that  Dantes  was an early gig so I went along at around 7 and found a small, nice bar full of older black people having some afterwork drinks to some old school disco vocal house. The bar girl, however, was a young blonde thing and she was hopeless. I made the dumb move of asking some guy if they were going to play some deep house (as advertised) and he was like, What you talkin bout girl? This  is  deep   house. I left soon after that and this quiet, tired guy came with me for some reason. We went to  Sonoteque , which had just opened, and had a good drink and painfully superficial conversation with some thirty-something white folk (So, what do  you  do? they asked my companion). Then to  Dark Room , which was also just opening, where the music was excellent and the party promised to grow. My new acquaintance fell asleep at the bar and I told him that it really would be better if he didn't come with me any further. To  Crobar  briefly, where I asked if I could just take a quick look around the place and they obliged, then back to  Sonoteque , where the party was now doing very nicely. The music was solid, the people were chill, the barstaff were more than competent, and one of the final tunes was Bad Boy by Mr Knuckles, so I was very happy. One of the DJs that night did something novel too - he cut between fresh house and proper disco in about a 3/3 format. I don't like disco much but some of the others did and just when I'd be getting pissed he'd cut back to some good stuff: I was impressed by the idea, which you could do with any genres. Maybe I should have stuck around with my friends after that but I'd purchased a hash muffin off some mad woman with a basket of the things so my thinking was a little impaired and I went to  Sound Bar  - a hyper modern, hyper hip superclub with a wack wack crowd - to hear James Zabiela of Renaissance or Global Underground or some superbrand fame. The music wasn't actually that bad but I wasn't down at all and soon left for  Smart Bar . Old school DJs like Pierre and Adonis were booked to spin but when I got there it wasn't so much acid house as banging proggy breaky stuff. I escaped to a friend's place pretty quick.  Saturday: "Claude Young" @ Vision / Rithma @ Big Wig / Leo Party @ Spy Bar. I went to  Vision  early to meet some friends and was therefore witness to a bizarre charitable hair competition; some of the crowd was amusing but the music was appalling. I stayed around until the main club opened next door then split to  Big Wig  to catch Rithma. If Rithma were a letter, he would be F: fucking friendly, fucking funky. He was one of the nicest, chillest DJs I've ever spoken to in a club environment as a stranger. It was his first time in Chicago and I was surprised by how few people knew he was in town. BW is more of a DJ bar than a club so although there were quite a lot of people scattered around drinking the dancefloor waxed and waned. By the time Rithma got on, though, the place was lively enough and I was delighted to hear some of the funkiest, freshest house music ever. Unfortunately I left early to hear Claude Young back at  Vision ; it turned out he didn't show up and there was some German playing fairly soul-less techno in his place, which contrasted badly with Rithma's organic tunes. Worse, nobody in the club even knew it wasn't Young spinning. Things were crazy outside  Spy   Bar  with people all standing round trying to get in. In the wake of the nightclub fire that killed about 50 people a while ago, the Chicago authorities are strict about numbers and had shown up that night, so the owners of the club were on the street indicating who could go in. Luckily Arman came up and helped me out and when I got downstairs the place wasn't even that full. Apparently clubs often claim a low capacity to keep insurance costs down and it never mattered but now that the regulations are being enforced it's working against them. Anyhow, I caught the end of Diz's set then all of Monna's (I think) and the music was some of the best I heard while in town. Typically, I was a little fucked up by this point and danced on a podium to escape the men on the floor and have some space to do my embarassing thing. And later that night, also typically, I decided to DJ. For the record, I totally suck. Most DJs choose not to get messed up before they play because it fucks shit up (witness how good crazy EQ'ing sounds to the E'd up and you can kind of get why), but I only ever play when I'm high as a hawk and the results aren't cool at all. Oh well.  Sunday: Dayra @ Iggy's / Sound Bar / Crobar. After sleeping all day I got up and decided to have some E for breakfast before hitting  Iggy's  for some food and beer. It was another lovely evening - in every way - and I met two funny people who insisted I go with them to the Sunday night gay parties at Sound Bar and Crobar. A little more Corona and some cocaine later I found myself dancing to some excellent tribal beats at  Sound Bar , courtesy of Ralph Rosario, then some bad progressive stuff at  Crobar . My brain was also sufficiently impaired that I thought it was a great idea to dance on a podium with this hot black chick and give my wallet to the gay barman, who liked the fact it had a pink star on it. I left with my most important possessions loosely contained in a purple velvet bag, feeling very stupid and gross.  Monday: Boom Boom Room @ Green Dolphin / OM Release Party @ Zentra. I showed up very early at  Green Dolphin  and had a quiet drink and cigarette down by the filthy Chicago River on a very beautiful night indeed. A man asked to take some photos of me and this was entertaining but delayed me getting to  Zentra  so I missed a lot of Diz's set. Luckily I still had all of Derrick Carter and Mark Farina to listen to, and after sitting down a while I couldn't resist dancing with the massive, sweaty crowd of fabulous Chicagoans. Afterward I should have gone straight to bed but instead I went with this guy to his South Side apartment and proceeded to get very freaked out as he snorted coke, smoked coke with weed in a bong, swigged tequila from a bottle and washed it all down with Corona, while talking about himself in the 3rd person. The only good thing to come of this excursion was the beautiful drive back to the city along Lakeshore Drive - dawn breaking with the famous skyline in the distance, then surrounding me for one last time. If I'm sounding sentimental as hell right now, it's because I am. I have so so much love for the city of Chicago.
