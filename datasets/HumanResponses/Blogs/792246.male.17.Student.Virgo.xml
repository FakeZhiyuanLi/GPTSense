       So much has happened in 5 days that I'll skimp on details and say  Birthday Giant Phallus Simpsons Genius Idiocy Sexual Enlightenment Annoying people in theatre class Annoying people not in theatre class Annoying people Queer As Folk Embaressment Awkwardness Resoultion Babies Claudia's Birthday Camden Money Polar Bears Ass License Test.  The only thing that didnt happen is having sex with Kaworu, and Brian and Michael from QAF. Theres always next week.   Wasn't this just the lamest post ever? I seriously couldn't tell the fun stories that had happened over this week? I mean, look at the stuff! There is some damn cool stuff in there! Argh. Note the foreshadowing of theater developments yet to come. Also, I had both asked Jonathan out and been rejected during this time, which you know, seemed significant at the time. Pff.

       Mua ha ha ha. Im posting from Jonathans computer without permission. ha!   If I remember correctly, there was originally a comment here from Jonathan saying something along the lines of "Mua ha ha ha. I'm commenting on Bun-Bun's website without permission. Ha!" This was lost in the great comment purge of whenever the fuck I did it. Just thought I should throw that in.

       Long day. Long tiring day. The chronology of it all escapes me. So I'll put things in whatever order I damn well please.  I saw Jeeyon and Ingrid at Borders. I felt kind of bad, because even though I recognized the name, I didn't know I'd actually met Ingrid before. I feel annoyed with myself. Sorry! That night was pretty crazy though.  Kids plays should have time limits. Claudia I love you, but that show was like 5 years long. Meh. It doesn't help that I'm one of those annoying people who doesn't find kids and everything they do cute. So sue me. They're mean, dirty, smelly, rude, little and stupid. Explain how any of those are good things. I suppose they do fit in most overhead storage compartments, but that doesnt become important often. So back on topic, I snuck out after my sister's scene and went home with Jenny and ate food and watched Cowboy Bebop for 30 minutes, then came back literally the second it ended. That's what we call timing. So my sister thought I stayed for the whole thing and I didnt go insane. Good story.  I have come to the conclusion that my parents are stuck in their teenage years. Is it wrong to bring your mom along when shopping downtown? Its weird I know, but shes very cool sometimes. As for my dad. Let's just say that hes the only person over 40 I know that is obsessed with Buffy. And its not even to bond with me, heck I've never watched Buffy in my life. Not to mention he watched Cowboy Bebop with me tonight. Meh, I never understand adults.  Why is it I'm tired at midnight? This is so unlike me. I confronted my mom and tried to get her to confess that she's actually a practitioner of witchcraft but she claims she hasn't. That's what they always say. Maybe we should have a witch trial. In the morning, though, I'm tired.  PS. I want more people in my friends list, it makes me look like a loser. Meh, maybe I'll just add people myself.   Ah, the first signs that Eric is a shallow loser! Oh good! My favorite part here is where I mention never having seen Buffy. Ironic, no? And there was a time when I was fuzzy on Ingrid's identity. Strangeness. Nothing much to say here, just gawking at how boring my site was/is.

       3 days til my birthday. Also 3 days til my driving test. Anyone who hasn't bought me a gift yet, here are some last minute suggestions.  A boyfriend The Congo(I'm really running out of time and Lizzy WILL kill me) A boyfriend Love Someone to fuck A boyfriend.  Well we know whats on my mind. Oh well.  I got my schedule. Yay! For all of you who go to Paly, you can get your schedule at viking.paly.net/dev. Assuming of course you can navigate their shit. Good times.  I got a Japanese dictionary! Yay! Now I can bring it when we go downtown to scare people. Not to mention I've been slowly making a list of all the "useful" words in the book. Sadly lacking much slang though. Super ultra mega formal japanese all the way through, with a few exceptions. Chinpo chinpo chinpo! Of course, this also means I have no excuse to delay starting my random translation of the 53843 Japanese artifacts lying around my room. Though I still really need a kanji dictionary. And furigana. Oh welly.  I've been playing a lot of Neverwinter Nights recently. I have come to the conclusion that having cows and chickens in the party is the coolest thing ever, despite a complete lack of usefulness. I just found a nymph's home. She's been keeping prisoners. Like the one under a spell that was standing there naked. Gee, I'd sure hate to be imprisoned there.  I'm really suffering from Rocky(for those of you are anal and/or Jonathan, Horror Picture Show) withdrawal. Not the movie itself obviously, but the whole experience. No amount of listening to clips from the show in Tokizawa can cure that. Or Yatta for that matter. Ah, Yatta. I so want to own Yatta on DVD. Along with Bible Black, hehe. Damn it. All the copies on Kazaa I've found of that have been raw, no sub, no dub. And since the dub was the best part("Why are you squeezing my tit professor"). Oh well, we'll just have to buy it for Jonathan's birthday or something.  My family sucks at keeping secrets. Nuff' said. Guess it runs in the family.  So last night I saw "Roman Holiday" with Kelly. The best part was this Italian taxi driver in the beginning who randomly went "BAU!" in the middle of one sentence. We're going to make a sequel, with sex and violence. Most likely titled, "Roman Holiday:The Sex and Violence Edition". Fun.   And on that note, girls suck. Goodbye   I should point out that none of the items on that list have actually been given to me, and I happen to have another birthday coming up in August. Something to think about. Ah, the days when Yatta was fresh.

       I'm alive. Claudia is back. I have very grave news everyone. I have been replaced. I am now no longer like Tigger. I am not the only one. Lame Claudia(hehe, it's a pun) has dubbed my sister(and as usual, the subtitled version is sooo much better), and dubbed her very wrongishly. Baby Bun-Bun indeed. I have some......unfinished business to take care of. Oh don't be upset, it was a mercy killing.  Now I have an important announcement for everyone. I like potato. I also like cabbage. I really love potato when it's all warm. It really makes me hungry. There is nothing like stuffing a big fat potato in your mouth and just sucking on it. Mmm, potato.  Now a very important public service announcement from our very own, Jonathan the Monkey. The very first talking monkey works for us now, mua ha ha. His first eye witness report is right here.  Jonathan:Feces taste bad.  Thank you Jonathan, and be sure to tune in next week viewers to see what happens when you give Jonathan a knife, a banana, and a Barbara Streissand blow-up doll and lock him in a room for 48 hours. This is Eric, saying good night.   This doesn't really have any content for me to actually comment on. Strange post, stranger people.

       Yay, I actually got to SEE people. It was incredible.  There is probably nothing as interesting as watching a film with me, Jonathan, Lizzy and Lizzy's mom. I recommend all of you try it, and live to tell the results.  I'm going to be all alone senior year. Blarg! I'm depressed now. Why why why? Oh well. I'll just have to send letter bombs to everyone. Twice.  I left my movie at Lizzy's house. And my bike, but that was intentional, making the DVD a far more tremendous problem. Lizzy?  What's with me doing carriage returns every  freaking  sec  ond?  Oh well, I like it. Am I sexy? I think I'm sexy. People, this is a critical survey. If you don't respond I'll sing Yatta non-stop for the rest of my life. And for those of you that wouldn't mind that, I'll never sing Yatta again. Don't ask how I do both, just receive the threat. Come people, tell me of my sexiness. For reference, come over right now and see me naked.     The movie in question was some little-known movie called "The Fellowship of the Ring". Yeah, I hadn't heard of it either. Oh, the irony of me whining about my senior year. Somehow, it almost seemed shorter than the others. Oh right.

       Meh. Life returns to normal, and thats good and bad. Tristan come home! Our lives are meaningless without you.  GOfisaIsihFOI! I've been playing FF4 on and off today, trying to get those fucking Imps to drop the fucking Imp summon. Fuck you Imps! Now I understand Garland's irrational fear. "I, Bun-Bun. will knock you all down!"  Ok, lets end the geeky references here for a second. Lizzy is a liar. She promised fun times today. She never came through. See if I get her the Congo. This only further proves that she is a lesbian.  So bored. If anyone has any idea at all on how to get me out of my house, please tell me right away.   Wow. Aren't I just the coooolest?

       What a bizarre day. I stayed up all night to "fix" my sleep cycle. I walked my dog around 9. It was weird. Very weird. got home, accidently fell asleep, woke up at 2:30. Oh well.  Now that Tristan's gone, we have no sort of transportation. This sucks. I say we steal his car.  My parents will be home in two hours. Oh well. It's time I get some more food anyways.  So bored. If anyone has any idea at all on how to get me out of my house, please tell me right away.   Slow days.

       Ok. My dog didn't get her evening walk tonight. I feel a teeny bit guilty. Well, not really. I still let her go outside on our lawn which she isn't normally allowed to do, so I made up for it. In other news, I got a kickass CD today, and it was free! In Borders they have their anime section in between their two kid sections, implying it was all appropriate for children. So I had the urge to recommend to some mother one of the ones I knew had at least one graphic rape scene. Seriously, someone is either really stupid or really mean.  Did you know in Japan they use sinks to fill their bathtubs? Well it's true, whether you believe it or not.  When my parents aren't here my house doesn't magically clean itself up. How annoying. I'm gonna ask the cats to do their part. brb. Assholes.  Dubbed Hentai is the best. Where else do you get chicks who magically grow dicks AND find badly acted wonderful lines such as "Why are you squeeing my tits professor?".  16 days til my birthday. w00t. hehe.  Jonathan:"NY Style Pizza sucks." Me:"Suck it." Me: "No, the pizza!"   Strange I know, but there was a time when people were unfamiliar with Bible Black. Fascinating I know. I also lost the aforementioned kickass CD, which was Jonathan's Friends Mix CD. I want another copy from someone sometime.

       My plan completly backfired. I didnt wake up around  12 today too, I woke up at 3. No thanks to this kick ass anime movie I picked up yesterday. My animals are more pissed. My talking cat was howling swear words. I still need to walk my dog. Ugh. I think I have a minor cold. Good times.   Jenny is the most amusing person ever. She can be totally pissed at you one night and be back to normal the next day.   Some unknown people decided to leave a very strange note on my TV. Hmm.  To anyone reading this, come abduct me. It's boring and hot here, and walking around the house naked isn't working. Someone please save me.   Those days were so boring. Wow. The "unknown" people were Tristan, Jonathan, and possibly Lizzy and Claudia, who's car broke down a few miles down the road and they needed to use my phone, even though castles don't have phones. Or something like that.

       I think I'm going to have to fix my damn sleep cycle temporarily. My pets all got their breakfast around 1 today, something they didn't seem to be able to adjust too as well as me. I swear that fish gave me an evil glare. I also discovered another strange aspect of my dog's accidental programming. She won't eat until AFTER her walk, so off we went. Of course, I forgot shoes, so it was painful and I burned several hundred skin cells. Some strange construction is going on at Claudia's church, and they're were a bunch of cars there too. They're was also this old dude standing in a bunch of plants next to a stop sign from across the street staring. My guess, either insane guy, or a minister or someone who needed out of the heat(it was shaded). I prefer to think insane guy.  I am now on Jonathan's link page, so my life is complete.....or something.  Important announcement everyone: the Taco Bell Express at the Mountain View Target sells meat products again! Yay! Of course, they then proceeded to tell me they were out of cheese quesidillas, so it sucked anyway.  Tristan, Lizzy and I came to three discoveries last night. One, Big Bird in Japan is still the best movie ever(ok, that was mostly me). Two, there is still nothing entertaining to do at my house. Three, my cat really DOES talk. Hold me.   Big Bird in Japan has still not been released on DVD. Shame shame. Question: If I was so happy about the Taco Bell in Target selling meat again, why was I trying to order a cheese quasedilla? And why is it that a year and a half later, I still can't spell that?

       Here I go with this web site thing again. Meh. At least this one requires minimal amounts of thought. Umm....yea. Expect incredibly erratic amounts of time between posts, because I'm a bastard like that. Hey everyone, guess what! My 16th birthday is still coming up, and if you can't think of anything to get me, be sure to check my daunting list on Amazon. I expect gifts from everyone I know even though I never give birthday presents.   My parents left for Yosemite this morning and I have the house to myself for three whole exciting drunken orgy-filled days. In addition to having to feed all our goddamn pets twice a day. I seriously considered "accidently" forgetting to feed that evil fish, but I have too much of a conscience or something. I'm using my sisters absence to secretly play all the video games she doesn't usually let me play, and I've discovered the coolest thing ever. Spyro the Dragon and Spongebob Squarepants have the same voice actor. If only one was as cool as the other. The second Spongebob DVD is being released a day after my birthday. Damn. Am I the only one who sometimes has the urge to buy DVDs just for the sake of having them and being able to put them on my shelf. It's an urge I often have to resist.  The other day I scared myself by having a very serious and detailed discussion with Jenny about what we'll do after high school. Not the basics such as where we will go and how we will study, but we discussed living arrangements, working(something I know I COULD be doing now), and all that other grownup stuff. Not that I'm not looking forward to some of it.  My neighbors scare me. One of them stood outside in the exact same position for like 20 minutes today. At least, he seemed to be in the exact same position when I started walking my dog and when I came back. I was afraid.  This is probably a good idea of how big to expect my posts to be. Most will likely be shorter. I know they're boring, but it's a good idea for myself to keep track of things also. Not to mention today was kind of a boring day.   The very first post. This was created a few months or so after I stopped updating PigeonDeath, a site which was failing suckage. Oh, and the evil fish are long dead.

       As I write this I have not gone to sleep. I also must be at school in an hour. "Oh, this is so bad."  Jonathan can't be 17. That makes me the baby again god fuck clit whore ass penis damn it.  I need another birthday. Too many things I need. See, the way I see it is, material desire is bad. The only way to solve my problem is to get me everything I want! It works, right?  You know who isn't a lesbian? Lizzy. It pains my heart to say this, but I thought it was time I informed the world. I know it's shocking, and a little bit unsettling, but it's ok. She's still Jesus!(And I'm still Bun-Bun, just in case you were wondering?) Let's go over a detailed analysis of the pros and cons of this event.  PROS:She is smart and realizes that penis is good.  CONS:She doesnt sleep with women.   Hmm. See, what I really want to know when I read this is whether or not I actually made it to school. Unlike some people, I don't operate very well with no sleep, and I'm thinking I probably feel asleep, possibly right after posting this. Funny. Oh, the days of Lizzy being a lesbian. And Lizzy being Jesus. Good times.

       Gab and Ryan's will hereby be referred to as Coitus Redux. Thank you.  The following AIM conversation snippit proves that talking to me when I'm tired produces amusing results.   [01:02] CireOfNamellef: I only remember two things about spain [01:02] CireOfNamellef: my game gear got stolen [01:02] CornTOWM: that's only one thing [01:02] CireOfNamellef: and we were staying a month with some friends in a house belonging to their friends in the middle of nowhere and we ran out of water [01:02] CireOfNamellef: so we were all like, "where is the water!?" [01:03] CireOfNamellef: so I decided we should drink pool water cause I was stupid and 8 [01:03] CireOfNamellef: and they were like, youre stupid [01:03] CornTOWM: and eight? [01:04] CireOfNamellef: and then one of us spotted a moving object(a rare sight) at the bottom of the ginormous hill we are on and took out binoculars and saw the water truck and we all danced [01:04] CireOfNamellef: as in my age [01:04] CornTOWM: yeah, i got it [01:05] CornTOWM: but you said you were stupid and eight and then people were like "you're stupid" so i thought they'd say "and eight" too [01:05] CireOfNamellef: except my mom didnt dance, because she was puking every 5 minutes because of her late stage of pregnancy. so if she danced there would be puke everywhere and wed need lots of water to clean it up and we had just gotten the water [01:05] CireOfNamellef: ah [01:05] CireOfNamellef: i think i tell stories best at 1 AM [01:05] CornTOWM: that story was beautiful [01:05] CornTOWM: yeah [01:06] CireOfNamellef: but the worst part was my game gear was stolen [01:07] CireOfNamellef: along with my dads 2000 dollar company laptop that contained "confidential information"(which was usually just my dads way of feeling important. I think I even tried to find confidential information but I couldnt get past the 8 million and 2 passwords [01:07] CireOfNamellef: but its all about the game gear [01:07] CireOfNamellef: oh and all our clothes were stolen too(cept the ones we were wearing) [01:07] CireOfNamellef: but again, game gear [01:08] CireOfNamellef: the moral of the story is, spanish cops suck [01:08] CireOfNamellef: they never got my game gear back [01:08] CireOfNamellef: whores [01:08] CireOfNamellef: i should write a book [01:08] CireOfNamellef: hell, i think my future book is currently writing itself   One thing that I don't think ever made it onto the site is that Gabe and Jessica's very brief relationship had been dubbed by me "Coitus Primus". Just a fun fact to tell your friends. Note that it's Bun-Bun's old screenname. But damn, I was funny back then. I'm so cool.

       Lets have a big round of applause for the people I've finally gotten around to adding to my links. Then lets forget how its been ten days since I've updated.  Sandman is my god. And this girl in my Japanese class was writing in a journal with Death's beautiful image plastered in about 46 different locations. Speaking of that class, its time for the adorable freshman stalking update.  I am now officially stating that my attraction to him is sexual. There! I admitted it! Yea, but hes emulating me and stealing my personality, which is flattering and ironic, since I stole all my personality from other people. We spent about 2 minutes make grotesque faces at each other, and it was beautiful and I felt like making love to him that very second. But yes, I am now officially a pedophile. You may all hate me now. Please send me hate mail, but nice ones please.   Oh joy, the Eric thinks he's a pedophile stage! Goodie! I don't think I knew at this point that Bret was a "celebrity", which makes the whole thing funnier somehow. The girl writing in the Death journal turned out to be Sophie, who eventually made it onto the aforementioned links section. This links section is ironically enough not there since the latest update of this site, as I am a lazy whore who didn't ever update it in the first place. So why bother?

       I warned that I was a lazy bum, and I proved it. I have not updated in 13 days. Spank me.  School. Yuck.  Ren Fair rocked!!! Even though the food kinda sucked, it was worth it to see Kelly flog this guy. And Sounds and Fury is the best group of...anything, ever!  I am now engaged to a 35 year old man. Good times.  Dude, adorable guy in Japanese class rant time. I'm still not completly sure whether my attraction towards him is kosher. I mean, he looks all kiddy, but maybe I'm just a pedophile. Anyways, he is obsessed with orange, which is a shame, but he likes Spongebob, which isn't. He also is very very effeminate, though this could be a prepubescant thing more than a gay thing. All I know is, he's going to be damn sexy one day.  Gab and Ryan are fucking again. Let's all cry. And then cut his hair.  I have ordered all Sandmans in existence. I will soon be locked in my room reading until the end of....me reading Sandman.  Once again, since NO ONE answered my last poll, I ask an all important question. Am I sexy? I think I'm sexy. Do YOU think I'm sexy?   Nostalgia much? Like everything in this post makes me go "..." I mean, its the first mention of me having a crush on Bret! Yowza. And Gab and Ryan are together again. Yowza. I had not read like  any  Sandman? Yowza. And this was around the end of the days where I had a large quantity of engagements. Mega yowza.

       So I went to the dentist today and I have a cavity. So I went to celebrate by eating Krispy Kremes. Good times. I scarred Jonathan into being a bum, so he's probably not going to be very sociable for the next few days. Bad hentai will do that to a men. That stuff should come with a warning from the Surgeon General. Doop de doop. Thats Portugese for boop de doopie doo!  So like, the major ultra exciting mega-orgasmic wet dreamish news is that  IRIS ACKER E-MAILED ME! She said that she really wanted a chance to thank me for letting her star in Roof, and she found my website by coincidence. I kindof prodded her, but she said she's going to start a Blogspot account! How exciting is this?! I'm DEFINATLY putting the link up when it's done. She also has ICQ and is a really cool person. Anyone who wants to chat with her, her ICQ # is 169409686. Shes really sweet people. And remember to tell her how hot we all think she is!   Wow, I must have been really bored. Huh.

       Shiranne and I are planning an exciting event filled with.....stuff. Friday at 1:40 we will be partaking in some fine cinema, as we watch a two and a half-hour Shinto acid trip(Spirited Away). Which is a wonderful movie, and you're all encouraged to come, unless I don't like you. If you aren't sure if I like you, here are some signs.  1. You have a webpage and I don't have it listed(could be attributed to laziness, so search for the following more) 2. I have tried to kill you many times. 3. I have said, "X, I do not like you" 4. I ignore you in social situations 5. I have declined an offer to have sex with you 6. You are ugly 7. You want in my pants(You know who you are, and more importantly I know who you are)  In other news I'm supposed to have a lap dancer for Gabe's birthday party by....tomorrow. At this point I'm turning to you, faithful readers. Any volunteers are welcome. I mean, even if you weren't invited, if you tell him you're there to dance on his lap while naked, I don't think he'll mind. Hmm...maybe Jessica should do this?  I rant on this subject way more than once a day, but I don't care.  How come there are so many people I want to sleep with, and so many people that want to sleep with me, and none of them are on both lists!   Thank you, please tune in next time for more of me.....naked.   I do believe this may be the first mention of Shiranne on the site. I could be wrong. Also, we never got a lap dancer.

       I want to be  urlLink Seanbaby  when I grow up. Not only does he have the best site ever for a personal site, but look at his  urlLink party pictures .  Hehe, the party was silly. It kicked butt. But everyone had to leave too fucking early. I felt like a sexual object. I got to sit on many peoples laps, Brad spanked me, and for some fucked up reason several people kept wanting me to be targeted in Psychiatrist. Hehe. And we had several minutes of discussing Cowboy Bebop! Woop de woop de doo! Supposedly the movie has its NA premiere at the expo today. Tis a good movie, though they picked on Faye too much.   PS Why does no one believe that I wrote and directed Roof?   ...I wrote "tis". I fucking wrote "tis"! This is not okay. Eiwjof'jioajdew[ekqpow. Okay, I'm feeling better. Anyways, I suck/ed at blogging, and the party in question is Jonathan's 17th birthday party I believe. Seanbaby is still gold though.

       I have email again. I also received questions from people that I got like a week ago but didn't receive til today.Joyous.  If all foes to plan, I will be directing "The Ground Zero Club" by Charles Schulman. Shiranne will be stage manager and assistant director, and Kelly will be Tanya!   Kelly never got her chance to be absolutely stunning as Tanya. I know she could have done it though.

       I'm sick again.  I am going to try with all my heart to direct "The Ground Zero Club" for Speed Limit 25.  My Amazon wishlist has grown due to the approaching holiday season. Buy me something and I buy you something. Don't play games with price matching. Spend as much as you want on me, I will spend what I feel you deserve on you. So don't give me a 100 dollar boxset if you think you're getting one in return.   I should have directed that, it was funny.

       Once upon a time, in a tiny kingdom so small that it had to expand to protect it's residents from disbelieving it existed, there was a frog named Theodore. Lets watch Theodore hop around his day.  PRINCESS:Oh Prince Charles, I love you so. PRINCE:Your face is as breathtaking as lightning, but nothing like as dangerous. PRINCESS:I can see your soul through your wet and slimy eyeball!  FROG:Excuse me, does either of you have a buck?  PRINCE:No, sorry, try the moneylender. PRINCESS:No, she'll never give out money to YOU.  FROG:Well I thank you, and I will try and see.  MONEYLENDER:And that is why you must soak in a warm bath for 7 hours every day! MAN:Oh, I see MONEYLENDER:If you want, I can soak with you. MAN:Hmm, that wouldn't be so bad. But are you sure that would be a good idea?  FROG:Excuse me, I would like a buck.  MONEYLENDER:You must soak in a bath for 3 hours every day. MAN:Why is it only 3 for him? MONEYLENDER:He's smaller. MAN:Makes sense.  FROG:I'll just...find someone else.  FROG:Excuse me sir, do you have a buck?  ERIC:Ego wa hanashimasen. Anata wa kaeru desu ka? Hai, sou desu. Anata no kokoro wa oishii desu ne.  FROG:Umm...never mind.  JEWISH PRINCESS:I'm a Jewish Princess!  FROG:Will you lend me a buck?  JEWISH PRINCESS:If you give it back when you're done. Tehehe  FROG:Oh, how witty. kiss me.  JEWISH PRINCESS:Oh, ok.  FROG:Blech! *Holds up fake mouth*  JEWISH PRINCESS: SMOOCH!  FROG: Oh! I turned into a man in a frog suit! I best be hopping away now!  GIRL IN FROG SUIT: Oh! What a beautiful creature! I love you!  FROG: Hmm, must be my day. Ya got a buck?  GIRL IN FROG SUIT: That's all you're charging? Alright, let's go!  *They go off stage to do their thing*  ERIC:Abunai!    Dude! Best play evah! I moved the title from the first line to the title field, as makes sense.

       I finally bought Jonathan his birthday present. Amazing. Twelfth Night was good stuff, especially to see Jeeyon' sexy beard and Paz being a pimp. Not to mention Jonathan being so gay. that on a scale of 1 to 10, he is very gay.  Living Skills was weird this year cause there were 4928490280 people on the panel. And there were these two hot guys who I ran into downtown. "Hey, it's the gay Paly guy!" "Hey, it's the bisexual Foothill guys!" Good stuff. I should write a book.  I want to kill Jenny and Wilhelm. Not only are they both really sexy, but then they have the audacity to dry hump on MY bed. MINE! You at least let me have a piece.  Let's all throw rocks at the newest addition to my links page, Giboc. I made a poem about him a few days ago, let's see if I can find it.   Tue Nov 19 22:00:58 2002 [22:02] CireOfNamellef: you are giboc  you are not thiboc  you live in a house  with people who wear a blouse  and a big gray mouse.    but the mouse is really a dog  who runs around and says "blog"  and enjoys to eat mushrooms  and watch flowers bloom    so that is you  now please dont eat a shoe  cause then you would die  and someone might cry    The content here varies in my opinion. I'm still a big fan of the Giboc poem, but god damn. I like to think my tolerance for certain people has gone down to more appropriate levels. Of course I now am a gay guy at Foothill, and have disowned all GSAs ever. Yay!

       I am in a movie. I think.  I am thinking of directing a play for Speed Limit 25, only because I want to try directing. I am looking for the following:  A play A co-director  Thank you.   You know, I never got a copy of that movie I was in. I feel jacked. Oh well. And I never directed a play for Speed Limit, though Claudia did.

       I have createst two very wonderful videos. They both are in WMV format(not my choice, it's "Windows Movie Maker") so you'll need the latest version of  urlLink Windows Media Player  to play it.  The first is a test of my movie making abilitites and is simply a slideshow with no content except to see cute pictures of 13 year old me, including one where it looks like I'm naked even though I'm not. The second is the gold.  For the very first time, Eric has created a thing of beauty. I have sculpted out of clay a true creation worthy of residence in the heavens. I have created a Yatta/Bible Black music video/tribute. Yes, love me for it. Note that I didn't bother syncing it, but instead of having Yatta play go on a black screen at the end, I have improvised with some amusing stalling techniques. Overall I'm really impressed with the sync, though it's awkward and slow at one part(you'll know it). It did cool/funny things I was NOT expecting it to. The only purposeful sync in the whole thing is the title screen.    The exciting birth of what I now call Bible Black 1. I've removed the links in this post, because they were extremely dead.

       So my mom got a new computer that came packaged with Windows XP, so I upgraded despite my dad telling me it was illegal. Despite all the crappy(actually its kinda nice) aesthetic shit they do to make it feel like a major upgrade, it really is a big step up I think. And it's so much better than ME that it's worth it anyways.   And of course I now use a Mac.

       Woo! For the rest of you who want some quick Cabbalistic Tree of Life info, go  urlLink here . This is so what I've been looking for.  In pure coinicidence,  Yesod ,the foundation, is represented in human anatomy by the phallus. (That's right girls, we have one more element of god than you do:P)  Now, Yesod is the medium for Tifaret(beauty) to unite with (actually, to try to unite with, which is important) Shekninah,(God's kingdom, the world we live in). The perverted of us cabbalistic acolytes(me), will notice that Tifaret is represented by the chest(yes, beauty is in the chest, god said so, tough luck girls who don't want breast implants) and Shekninah by the mouth(which is so cool and I don't want to get into why right now.) This means that the male phallus is a channel for the chest to connect with the mouth. Oh my! That's right everyone. The Tree of Life says that our world exists due to God having oral sex.   I'm a hippy. Oh well, at least I mentioned sex at least once in this post.

       So like, I dumped the really unprofessional and sloppy links section, because I've finally progressed beyond my websites of the past, those things I made in a day when I was 12 that I thought were the coolest thing ever despite the lack of anything but links. I obviously haven't progressed beyond my rampant usage of run-on sentences, or reoccuring sentence structure to create mild amusement for myself.  I also added the adorable GIF at left, which I swiped(hey, if she can't write English, how is she going to know?) from a very sweet Japanese girls website. The observant among you will notice that this girl does the the entire Rajio Taisou, in all it's glory. Enjoy it. I know you will appreciate it as much as me.  Wasn't that the most beautifully erotic thing in a while? For those of you that I don't regularly rant at online, I am referring to the storm. It was sexy. I want to make love to it, even if there was a stupid gate banging into my outside wall every 5 seconds. Also, my message this morning was cut off by my Math teacher happening to walk through the library. So yes, I did not get to add an all important message at the end.   Oh of course, I have to have mentioned that in the NEXT post. Wow, these commentaries are getting more and more useless by the post. Especially since almost this whole post is about changes to the site which are no longer in any way relevant. Oh well.

       I write this in the library while "cutting" 4th period. There is a Cravens next to me. Is it Wes Cravens? I leave that up to interpretation. This specific Cravens was just telling me a rather surreal dream they had, and they are also a fan of Nightmare on Elm Street. Hmm.  I'm not really cutting. I got here late, hanged out with said Cravens a few minutes and then couldn't find my class. Good times(eat that Jonathan). So like, I came up with a superhero. "Big Nose Santa". He flies around on a sleigh and saves Jews from Christian and Muslim oppresion, and then gives them dreidels afterwards. Action figures TBA.  In geeky news, the Playstation remakes of Final Fantasy 1&2 have been confirmed for a US release. *orgasms, as said Cravens will testify* This means that every single one except for 3 is now playable on Playstation 2. Yatta!  Claudia has comments now. Good times.  EDIT: Above "Good times." should be followed by the words "Suck that Jonathan. That's right. They're NOT your words. Go suck some penis." Thank you for your time and we apologize for the printing(?) error.   The first of MANY posts from the library. It's almost like a landmark. Anyways, if I'm not mistaken, this post was interrupted by my math teacher walking into the library and spotting me, while I was "cutting" that very class. I believe they were in the computer lab. Blah.

       Hello.   Profound, huh? I have no clue what this is about. It is however the last post of 2002, which is semi-significant. It may have been someone like Claudia posting on my site from my computer, as we had a sleepover that year. I specifically remember Kelly reading some hilarious erotica outloud at choice moments. Good times. Sort of.

       I had many things to write, but I forgot them all.  I keep slipping into these moods where I feel unwanted and alone. I feel that if I don't receive constant attention I'm a reject. Every moment I'm by myself is painful. I just need someone who can be by my side. So I don't feel alone. So I'm not alone.   I should have figured out from here on that I just can't make that angst thing work. Loser.

       So it seems the entire world is in a state of confusion over something....at least my world. My life remains relatively straightforward, as I know exactly what I want, and why I want it. People should take note from me.....I'm such a pretentious dick.  I've noticed some major differences between other peoples' blogs and mine. Whereas a lot of people I know speak in semi-poetic cryptic pretty stuff, I tell it like it is. What does that say? I think I just don't have the talent.    I deleted the poem, because it was teh suck.

       Life continues, albeit slowly and awkwardly. I will be purposely cryptic to annoy you all.  I wrote a poem. It was inspired by my hatred of poetry. I'll post it later because I'm at school right now.   Christmas presents abound, though no Jenny yet. This is most serious. :P  This is probably the most casual Christmas for me ever. I haven't even really thought about what I really want, a total contrast with my typical material desire of practically everything. Maybe I could be Buddhist.  I'm cutting 4th for Claudia. I'm horrible. And yet super-sweet at the same time. I contradict my own mind. Help.  I can now watch End of Evangelion without subtitles. I know the whole movie. Except that stupid 2 minute scene in the Mayor's office with the freaky pendulum where they talk about boring crap. Meh.  I want a Kaworu plushy. Love me.   I'm not sure I ever made a post when Tristan and Claudia broke up, but I think this is what's being addressed in the beginning. I still don't know that one part of End of Evangelion.

       Arg, I just lost a whole entry I almost had thanks to my own stupitidy. I love myself.  Anyways, here we go again.  I had a really weird surreal dream that i was messing with my eye(maybe i had an itch or something) and it fell out, and it was really bloody and blood was pouring out of eye. So I was in so much pain I wasn't thinking right, so I kind of jumped onto the floor and tried to pop it back in. I then had like these "dream ripples" throughout the day, where eyes kept coming up in conversations, and all this weird stuff.  a)Sandman has some eye motifs at parts, which I happened to be reading today. b)Midsummer has eyes as a very major theme, if you look for it. c)My sister was telling a friend a lie about how when she was little she punched me and caused my eye to fall out. d)Lastly, some asshole on AIM made a rude remark involving poking me in the eye. Bitch.  I can't direct "Ground Zero", but I'm still directing something. Meh.  I have fallen in love with Xenogears again. Big robots, deep 8-dimensional characters, deep plot involving said robots and characters, plus a healthy(actually, far beyond healthy) does of religion and you get....one of the worst "games" ever made. But hey, it's a 70 hour game, and most of it is plot anyways, so I like to think of it as semi-interactive Evangelion, with no Japanese voice-overs or Kaworu :(  Sandman is gay. They form a rainbow when you own them all. Tehehe.  Jenny's sister Tina is coming home on the 19th, which is a Thursday. I think we're still in school, which means Jenny is going to try to convince her to come and visit all of us little people.(Hehe, it's funny cause she's a lot older than any of us, but she's really short, hehehe). Which will rock. I want to have her abortion.   Wow, that eye dream certainly made a longterm effect on me. Hmm. More nerdiness, blah blah blah. I never got to direct anything, and Sandman has been upgraded to being very very gay, not just gay.

       Despite being under some really interesting circumstances, I'm having a great few days. I was able to(in my eyes) re-establish a friendship that had been corrupted in invisible ways by my own hands, dance with some of the greatest women ever all in a small room, have the most polar relationship ever, and kiss Giboc.  I've heard people say that your views of someone can change amazingly fast, but I'd never been witness to this until very recently. Immense polarization is wonderful, and it seems to happen in our relationship and internally as well.  And also, thanks to some important revisions, I can now finally have totally candid, honest, and helpful talks with one of the most intelligent and caring people I know.   The friendship was with Jonathan, the polar relationship was with Claudia, and the kiss was with Giboc. Of course, I had already said that last part in the original post. Yeah, I had been pissed at Claudia around this time I believe. Guess that didn't last.

       I'm depressed. And I can finally summarize why. I have no love and have no idea what to do with my future. Thank you for your time, please sign the guestbook on the way out.  But anyways, my notions on love are getting out of hand. I find myself fantasizing about the most absurd scenarios, in which the guy I like will magically show up at my door and make love to me. I'm hopeless.  As for the other issue, I'm royally fucked. I'm abandoning acting, which leaves me with interests in Religion and Japanese, but definately not a combination of the two.   That first paragraph is still pretty damn true.

       What is with me being the only gay guy at Paly? It's so not cool. I just want to get laid like everybody else!  Coming out was way overhyped. People paid just as little attention to me afterwards as they did before. Except my friends. Who are all like, "Yea?". Meh.  I spend far too much of my time wishing so-and-so was gay. Hell, I think I can tell better than they can. I can think of at least 10 people who I should just spreads rumors about to get it started. Then when they're out I can sleep with them, and never speak to them again.  I mean, I have to listen to people I hang out with complain that it's been too long since they've had sex. At least there are people of your sexual orientation that exist around you! Let's see how long it's been since Eric got laid. Umm....forever and a half! Buuyaka!  Don't get me wrong. I'm not all about sex with no love. I just don't associate them very well. But when Eric finally gets the love he desires(*wink wink* maybe?) I could totally dig that monogamy thing. Screw college, I want sex now! I feel deprived of good times.   No, Scotty doesn't count. I'm not sure why. But for purposes of this post at the time, he largely didn't.

       Interesting morning. It was one of those morning where you think you're really sick and then you finish waking up and you realize you were just tired.  So I was talking to my mother about being a woman at MIT in 1976-80. She said that the male to female ratio was about 10:1. She had many classes where she was the only woman. I asked if she got a lot of sexism in any way because of this, but apparently she only got nerdy freaks hitting on her everywhere she went. She actually liked it, because there were these 500 or so women, who were not very popular at their high schools, and now they were the center of attention. Apparently the most uncomfortable part was sitting in those classrooms where she was the only woman and knowing that every guy in that room was looking and fixating on her. But that was what my father was there for.  My PS2 is 100% brokenified. I'm renting one today from Blockbuster so I can at least play my new game.  Weekends are not long enough. But when you think about it, the length never makes a difference, it always feels the same when it's over. I wish I were Japanese though. It must be really exciting knowing that starting next year they're getting a whole 2-day weekend, EVERY WEEK! Think about how wonderful it would be if your weekend was expanded for the rest of your academic career. Let's just ignore the fact that it's being upgraded to match ours.  Speaking of which, how much would it suck to have 1-day weekends. That's one whole day for you to socialize. In addition, keep in mind that most students spend their weekend doing homework and studying. I would hate to be Japanese.  And sleepovers! Not so much now, but my childhood was fulfilled almost exclusively through sleepovers. Now, imagine if you could only have a sleepover Saturday night, and Saturday had to be spent at school, and Sunday you had to work. That would suck....penis.  Giboc and I are losers. We spent a good chunk of an hour yesterday discussing giant robots. In summary: a:Transformers was an American show. The movie may have been made in Japan. b:The robotics team is going to build us all robots. Namely:  b1:The Usaginator for myself  b2:The ROTOC for Giboc(Robot On Top Of Car)  b3:The Jewish Princess for Gabe  b4:The Hon Hon Hon Mistress for Gabrielle  b5:The Prom Dress Shopper for Lizzy  b6:The Dumper for Claudia(she's gonna kill me for that one)  b7:The Grammar Teacher for Jonathan  b8:Mega Radzinski(a giant giant robot piloted by the three Radzinski siblings)  b9:The Brahma Fighting Cow for Amanda Huggenkiss  b10: and something for other people too. c:Xenogears ownz j00 d:Cloud is sexy and gay e:I'm gay. f:So is Schmarc.   Good times

       My site isn't sick "no more".  I'm cutting math again. Hit me. Then again, I think it's my first real "cut" of thi semester. But still, bad habit. Bad habit.  Partay at my house tomorrow! Woo! I think we need to watch "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" and "Cannibal: The Musical". It'll make my life complete, cause Terrence and Philip are sweet.  Today at lunch I plan to orchestrate a four person performance of "What Would Brian Boytano Do?". Wish me luck.  Link is sexy. As an adult. Actually I think he becomes like 15. But they call that "Adult Link", what the hey is up with that? Anyways, he grunts whenever he jumps, so I just jump around a lot and wet my pants.  Weekend! How come the shorter the week is, the more unbearable the wait until the weekend is? It's one of those things that you feel like you know the answer to, and then you realize you don't.  What's with everyone wanting comments back? You all see me like every day anyways. And plus, my e-mail and Instant messaging screen names are listed right there. See them? I'm like always online too, remember that.  You all suck.   Naturally I lost the comment war.

       And I update from the library again.  Let's take a quick poll. If you got to school and the period you're supposed to be at is half over, would  you  go? I know I didn't....I mean wouldn't.  No Rocky tonight....too unrealistic. But let's make plans to go to the next one, in two weeks I assume.  Life is funky.....kinda like chicken.  Two men walk into a bar. The first says, "I'm going to order a drink.". The other says, "Okay." Then a mysterious man in a black coat comes and kills them both.  The End    Once again I'm disturbed by how much my humor is stagnant.

       I am sick. I hate all you non-sick people.  Never underestimate the power of the Health Office. It's a little known fact that when you say you're going to the Health Office, the Health Office grows in size to include the entire Paly campus(including the library) and Town & Country. It's a big Health Office, and I am in it as we speak.  I want to go to Rocky on Friday. A lot.   The Health Office was a technique I would come to use on multiple occasions, mostly my Junior year. I didn't end up going to Rocky that Friday, which I believe is mentioned in the next post.

       I deleted my war commentary. Before anyone gets all jumpy and happy and think Bun-Bun changed his mind, I'd like to tell you that that's not true. The real truth of the matter is that it was a badly written, tangent filled piece of trash. I originally wrote it to vent, and it shows. I figured that since I spent so much time writing it, I might as well post it. About a day later however, Jonathan posted a paragraph of it on his site, and I read it and realized it was shit. So I take it down. I still agree with it all, I just thought it was ugly. Thank you, and have a nice day :P.

       I feel so fucking weird right now. So I'm going to use fucking gratuitous swearing. Bite me.  I would like to point out that I have been at strike for every single Lo show. I don't know why. I had such a blast though. For once I didn't feel totally outcasted from the theatre people. Even though I was. I just had so many people that I could hug and dance with that I just felt like most fucking cool person on Earth. And I didn't care if people thought I was weird. I just wanted to have fun. And I did. People were nice to me even if they didn't really like me, and though that sounds pretty pathetic, I enjoyed it.  I've been thinking about how weird the "in" theatre people must view me as. In class I was always completely silent, except when rehearsing or performing. I just didn't have a need to socialize or even communicate with these people. Then when I'm around my friends I try to act really wild and crazy(genuinely, I really am wild and crazy inside) in an attempt to shock them or something. Maybe I just want them to know that I'm not always silent or something. In the past this behavior has never really done anything. They would still never notice me. But tonight I think they maybe did. Some people seemed a little surprised that I lived this "other life", and for whatever selfish part of me I was feeding, it made me feel good. There are people I plainly dislike, and don't care if they don't notice me. But there are some who I always wished would maybe pay a little attention to me. And they did, for better or worse. Even offering me a cookie was all I needed to get a sense of closure from it all, and I think I am now content to be on the outside of the Theatre. Goodbye Haymarket. Looking back, It wasn't as bad as I always said it was.  We went to Happy Donuts. It's a great place.  They give you free stuff. I started to notice the immense variety of people that go there too. Unlike previous hangouts where they attract very specific groups of people, this place had everyone. We had a couple of college-age Asian guys, studying something(one took a birthday picture for us). We had a few older men reading the newspaper or magazines while out getting donuts at 1 o' clock for whatever reason. And my personal favorite, we had the strange man on the computer on his laptop. The laptop was on, but he never did anything. He just left it on the desktop like a compulsive need to have a screen in front of him. It's like me and my need to have electronics buzzing for me to get to sleep at night(that's one thing people loooove).  I need to stop acting like I'm really desperate for sexual attention. I'm really not, except once in a blue moon where I do have a craving for it. i just enjoy pretending to play the part of the sexually deprived little gay rabbit who needs his happy fun hour. But honestly, I'm perfectly content as is. Well, at least in that aspect.   I'm so happy for Claudia. I think this* is exciting for all of us, because it quite possibly is the birth of a new era in our lives. The era of *gasp* actual dating. Instead of the whole comfy sleep with your friend stuff of high school, our group might finally make that scary and probably bad step into the real world. The pessimist inside me would go up to her and be like, "It won't work. You're stupid.". But that's why the pessimist inside me is hidden in a little bottle that's labeled, "Only open in emergancys that require extreme rational thinking, such as a nuclear attack".  For once I don't want to stop writing. I got into a phase where updates became tedious. Even rarer was the update that is not completely comedic. Don't expect this to be a trend, just an homage to the good old days. What am I talking about, my blog has always been about dancing monkeys and strange men hovering around Lutheran Churches.  I doubt she reads this(or knows it exists), but today is Yael's 16th birthday. Happy Birthday Yael!  I bid you all adieu. *If you don't know what I'm talking about, ask Claudia. And yes, I just wanted to use an asterix. Happy fun time!

       I am writing this up on my mom's computer with stingy owie "Purple Haze" hairdye on my head. It's a long story.  It's 2 and a half hours until prom. Joy. I have no time to get ready. I have to do many things. And I can't due them because there is hair dye on my head. Ow. It stings.  I had ugly hair today at school. You see, the reason I am dyeing my hair is because we dyed it yesterday, and it was atrocious and ugly. So now we are dyeing it again. And if it's ugly, all of Paly will know and laugh at me tonight. I could be more optimistic. I'm not. So I ran around under my hood all day. I even convinced Kamikihara-sensei to let me have my hood up in class. How sweet of her. The worst were the people who thought the hair wasn't "that bad". I'm like...so you're acknowledging it's bad, and then you're saying I'm stupid for thinking it's really bad. So it's worse than telling me it's ugly. So stop it Kelly. Just because Kimmy hates me doesn't mean you have to.  25 minutes before the stingyness can go away. Go away stinginess! I think the pain is affecting my spelling. I spelled stinginess in two different ways.  Purple Haze will be a success I think. See, it'll either come out purple or black(the asian guy they have on the front has black hair. It's not until you look up close that you can see the purple. So that'll be awesome. Or it could be really black, which would be good. Or it will be purple, which would be good. I can't lose! Whee! Bikutari!  I'm doing stream of consciousness writing. I'm hoping by the time it's time to take the dye off I will be done here. Err...reverse that statement. Anyways, eggs. They're tasty.  Oh, so I celebrated Passover. Now, before you tell me I'm not Jewish, I want to tell you I am. Something people don't seem to understand is that Passover has very little theistic purpose and is much more of a cultural religion. And last time I checked, I was still Jewish ethnically. So maybe that's why I did it. I toyed with the idea of celebrating a bunch of holidays, but it makes sense the most to me to celebrate cultural holidays in Christianity(Do Lutherans and Presbyterians have any special days? You know, like the Catholics.) and Judaism.   Oooh, the dye just did a weird sting, it was like a sting orgasm. It kind of came up in sting power and climaxed for a few seconds then went back down. Maybe it was my brain cells frying.  Now it's in the phase where individual parts of my head sting. Bzzt!  Oh, my hair all just fell out and I am dead. Goodbye.  April Fools!  Oh by the way, in case you haven't noticed, It's past the day I SAID I would be moving. That's because I already moved. I am in Boston right now. Actually know, I convinced my mom to let me stay for prom,  but I'm leaving tomorrow of course.  Why do teachers feel the need to give homework on prom weekend? Are they thinking that if they give out homework people will do that instead of having sex and getting drunk. Well...I suppose that could be Living Skills homework.  Whee! Purple Haze!  15 minutes left. My mom is hovering over my shoulder. Now she's not. She's silly like that. La la la la la. "You could be doing homework instead of that?" "No, I couldn't. Sting make brain hurt." "Oh" .... ... This is going to be the stupidest post ever. I wish I could the LJ thing and only have some of it show up and you can click to see the rest on a seperate page. But nooo....that would be far too nice. :P  So Bret is famous. Funny how that works. He was in a Fiona Apple music video too, so you KNOW he's famous. And he was in "Tap Kids", some show in New York. Silly internet. And he has an entry on IMdb. Funny.  Shiranne and I have started "Pretty Person of the Day" in Japanese class. So far our winners have been: Clement Andy Jeannet Bret  I'm sure they're all honored. Though only Jeannet and Bret know they're winners, because Andy thinks(knows?) we're freaks and we've never talked to Clement in our lives. Good times.  I just realized my website will now probably show up when someone searches those names. Sorry if this happens guys, but hey, Brets already famous, and Luong is a common last name. So...who knows.   10 minutes. 10 painful minutes. *stares at clock* 9 minutes.  "I'm sick of this rain", said by my wonderful mother. Thank you mom.  8. Prom prom! It's like pom pom, only with r's. How exciting. Why is nobody going to prom this year? Off the top of my head, the following people aren't going to prom who should be: Tristan Claudia Portia Yael Shiranne Jonathan Lizzy Giboc Gabrielle Ryan(haha) SOME of the freshman in Japanese class...and sophomores. >_>.... _ Margaret Thatcher Bob Dole The guy on the packaging for "Clairol Herbal Essences Purple Haze Hair Dye."  5 minutes. What the hell is Level 3: Permenant. Is Level 2 a lower stage of permenant or is it semi-permenant. This sort of vagueness is unacceptable. We should burn Long's. On a day MJ isn't working there. We wouldn't want to lose MJ...yet. Not before she gives birth to the clone of Jesus. Wait, but I don't think MJ is a virgin....this ruins my plan. Okay, burn Long's whenever.  2 minutes. The guy on the box is looking at me. I think he's checking me out. Woo! I love it when Asian man on hair dye packages check me out, it makes me feel so good about himself.  1 minute. *stares at clock*. Doop. Deep. Doop. Deep. Doop. Deep. Doop. Deep.  Doop. Deep. Doop. Doop. Doop. Doop.

       I'm back at school. This would imply that I'm in better health. It sure fooled me.  Following is the briefing and summary of Operation:Alpha-Omega. What you are about to read may seem like a weird joke, but I assure you it is an accurate telling of events along with the most plausible theorys.  At some point before 5:45 PST, on Friday, April 10th 2003, I, Erik "Bun-Bun", and Tristan Mueller-Vollmer crossed over into another dimension. To the best of our knowledge we are still inside this dimension, making us outsiders in your world. As a result of us crossing many things happened. I will try to be as detailed as necessary, but I will change names to protect these people's identities. In addition, the dimensions will be referred to as Alpha and Omega, being my home dimension and the one I am currently in respectively. If you are reading this, consider yourself an Omegan.   List of discovered phenomena caused by dimension hop   a) Many friends and acquatinces of ours partially appeared to make the hop with us. In one case, a man who we will refer to as Bonathan's Alpha self mentally merged with his Omega self, giving him the memories of both people, and causing him to develop psychic powers.  b) Another friend, who we shall call Bizzy, had a similar thing occur to her. However, when her mental self crossed over it discovered a very severe obstacle. Bizzy Bood died in this dimension when she was very young, meaning that Alpha Bizzy's "spirit" had no body to migrate to. This caused her existence to be threatened. While she can remain in the spirit form indefinately with no immediately perceivable danger, her ability to interact with the world is gone. Luckily, at the same moment this occured, I ask you to recall that Bonathan was developing psychic powers. Having them develop fully in such a short time caused them to activate automatically and go out of control. Bizzy's spirit seemed to find that, and use the powers to create a physical body for herself. After this, Bonathan's psychic powers are keeping Bizzy in a physical form, though when he gets distracted(such as browsing for CDs), or goes to sleep, Bizzy returns to her spiritual form, at least until morning(to be fair, with Bonathan's sleep cycle, it tends to be the afternoon).  More will probably surface, and I might be forgetting something as well. But for now...   Evidence for Dimension Hopping   At this point, some of you may be thinking I'm insane.  So if you would allow me, I would like to present the evidence that we used to originally establish that a dimensional shift had occured.  a) Tristan was working at his place of employment (the library), when he heard the message that the Library would be closing in 15 minutes. This would be acceptable if it hadn't been closing an hour early.  b) Tristan's passenger side door opens from the outside. This door had previously not worked for around 63 years.  c) Tristan's car was also shiny and clean, a state which he claims was not put that way by him. Indeed, he says the car was washed "months ago".  d) Blaudia Braven's church was emanating evil waves. Both Tristan and I felt something was different about the church, but could not locate any physical difference. Ms. Bravens claims that the difference is that bushes were removed, something done months ago. Clearly she is part of the Satanist movement inside the "Brace Butheran Burch".  e) Upon pulling up at Bonathan's house, he was already outside walking towards us. Clearly, he had become psychic. He also was very confused, clearly due to the memory gain he had just recently experienced.    Potential Theories   By now I hope I have convinced you that Tristan and I are not of this world, and I hope you are now wondering exactly how we crossed over. Unfortunately, we have little clues to tell us. I have developed several theories for why we are here.  a) Someone called us over. Why this person would want to summon two people from another dimension is a mystery, not to mention how this person did it.  b) The Omega Bizzy Bood didn't die a long time ago. Similar to a), she sacrificed herself in a bizarre ritual to summon us over. Why she would have done this, I know not.  c) We stepped on a physical spot that transported us through space. Odd, and why would people have not figured it out. Unlikely.  d) Accelerating to a certain speed in a moving vehicle caused us to switch over. Possibly caused by playing "Double the Speed-Limit" with Tristan. See Back to the Future for an idea.   I will post more later. As for now, I must attend my Omega classes.

       I had a really long post explaining all this, but I lost it. Which makes it all the more depressing.  For those of you who I haven't told yet, something really depressing is happening on April 23rd.  Let me give you background. My father was very annoyed with his employer, disagreeing with some of their corporate decisions strongly. Over Christmas break, an old work friend of my father's from Agfa jokingly mentioned he was always welcome to go back and take his old job. At the time he didn't even consider it. Flash forward to now. His company(EFI) has just liquified the project he spent 7 months working on, as well as docking his salary, and lowering health-care benefits, again. He quit on the spot, without even telling us before he did it. He also negotiated his way out of the two-weeks notice.  He then went to search for a new job. Unfortunately, in a sad truth I wish he would have considered first, it is impossible to find work in the Bay Area right now.  So his plan was to move back to Boston for a few months, working at Agfa until he could find a real job back here. This plan was decided about a week ago. Last night however, my uncle(on my father's side) passed away from a heart attack.  Aside from the emotional baggage we all have from this, it poses other problems as well. My uncle was the sole source of income for his family, and they have very little money right now. He was also the sole caretaker of my grandparents, neither my father or aunt wanting that responsibility. My grandparents need regular adult care and supervision, and are currently being evaluated as to whether to be moved into a nursing home.  So my father's plan to stay for a few months, probably just during the summer, has turned into an indefinate length of time. My mother, already upset at this previous plan, insists on going with him now, and according to her, if we're all moving to Boston for a long time, it doesn't make sense to move back to Palo Alto. My father's other sibling, my aunt, lives in Chicago, which is too far away to be of any help whatsoever. So we are moving to Boston on April 23rd. I'm sorry.  Now the corny part. I love you all. I really do. I don't think many of you really know how truly shitty my life was until I met all of you, and if you do, I doubt you know how much I appreciate it. I am still going to be here until the 23rd, and I believe that means I can still go to Prom. I am also going to try and spend the month of August here for the most part, so I get to say goodbye to all of you.  Lastly, I wrote a  urlLink poem  expressing my feelings about all of this. I know it sucks, and I can't write, but it's the only way I knew how to express what I'm going through. I truly feel like a part of me has died. I love you all.

       Library again.  We had the worst sub EVER in Living Skills. He just decided to talk for the whole period, about the most boring things on Earth with his offensive and ridiculous opinions. So I asked to go the bathroom, and he doesn't even notice as I take my backpack with me. Which takes me here.  So if you ever have "Dr. Vass" as a substitute, just ask to go the bathroom, and you'll be the hero of your whole class.

         Palo Alto High School  awards   Eric Fellemen   May 23, 2003   The Rachel H. Austin Prize   in recognition of academic excellence, striving, & achievement in   Japanese    Yeehaw! I was sitting through the ceremony waiting to get anything except this, the only one I really wanted. And I got it. I am so incredibly happy. Out of every student taking Japanese, I was the one they picked. I'm more than a little shocked.  And hey, I got $50. Which more than makes up for the misspelling of my last name.

        Eric writes Fan Fiction   Note: The following is  fan fiction based on the book "The Holy Bible" by God. If you haven't read it, don't read further, it has spoilers.  Jesus looked into his beautiful eyes, lost in the mist of fog surrounding his heart. He leaned forward to kiss him, pressing his lips into his, savoring the taste of his mouth, exploring each other with their tongues. They lost each other in their embrace. "Joseph", he cried out. His father was so beautiful.  Joseph loved his son very much. Even if Jesus wasn't his blood son, he felt a duty to look over him. So as he passionately kissed him, he started to caress Jesus's more private areas with his hands, squeezing his sensual love cheeks.  Someone knocked at door. It was Mary. "Jesus, your friend Mary Magdalene is here to play." They opened the door and gasped in horror. "Joseph, how dare you touch Jesus! You know he is only to make love to both of us at the same time! Now move over and let me have a turn. Mary, you may join us."  And the four of them spent the evening expressing their love for each other in various ways.  Amen.

       In the next two weeks I will be attending three award ceremony and honor thingies.  First of which is the Rachel Austin award I'm on Friday. This confuses me, because it says the Rachel Austin award goes to people demonstrating "academic excellence", which makes me think they sent the letter to the wrong house.  Secondly I am being honored by the school board for being gay...sort of. Unfortunately I lost the paper and don't have the date for this event. Claudia? Tristan? Somebody help please.  Lastly I have to attend Senior Showcase because...I'm not sure. I guess to make sure she doesn't give me an award in a shallow attempt to make me love her. And to see who wins for Best Costume Designer. I just can't imagine who.

       So Ms. Paugh presented us with a choice. We could stay in class to watch a film I've already seen, or I could go to the library to read our books. Obviously she can't be in two places at once, meaning I can be here in the library and procrastinate.  Amy doesn't want to be here, she wants to go to sleep. She seems impressed that I can type without looking at the monitor or the keyboard, so I'm scaring her by looking directly at her while typing.  There are seniors here on Senior Cut Day. I hate them. I also hate the juniors who are planning this Junior Cut Day, they're stupid.  Happy Birthday Mom! However I hope to god you can't read this site.

       Eric made a new Bible Black music video. However if I was to give it to everyone,  my bandwidth would shoot me in the middle of my sleep. So this short quiz will be the determining factor.  The beginning URL is of course http://www.angelfire.com/weird/pigeondeath/  from that point on, the characters are  1. The first initial of the freshman in my Japanese class I have a bizarre obsession with 2. I like two anime shows. One of them is two words. The first letter of the second word is _. 3. Number of countries I have lived in. 3. No clue here, just a _. 4. The number of times I have had sex 5. The number of theatre shows I have been in since Ms. Lo came to Paly, minus 2. 6. My favorite character in Neon Genesis Evangelion's name can mean this. 7. The number of times Eric took his behind-the-wheel driver's license test, minus 2. Enjoy

       I'm updating.  Jonathan just came in contact with SARS. But he washed his hands, so he's safe.  Kelly adopted 48 children.   Kimmy is next to me. She hasn't tried to kill me yet. But she does have headphones on, so maybe she doesn't know I'm here. La la la.  Kelly is probably going to get mad at me for typing that. Never mind, she's laughing.  The End.

        http://www.mindmedia.com/brainworks/profiler    Eric, you exhibit an even balance between left- and right- hemisphere dominance and a slight preference for visual over auditory processing. With a score this balanced, it is likely that you would have slightly different results each time you complete this self-assessment quiz.   You are a well-rounded person, distinctly individualistic and artistic, an active and multidimensional learner. At the same time, you are logical and disciplined, can operate well within an organization, and are sensitive towards others without losing objectivity. You are organized and goal-directed. Although a "thinking" individual, you "take in" entire situations readily and can act on intuition.   You sometimes tend to vacillate in your learning styles. Learning might take you longer than someone of equal intellect, but you will tend to be more thorough and retain the material longer than those other individuals. You will alternate between logic and impulse. This vacillation will not normally be intentional or deliberate, so you may experience anxiety in situations where you are not certain which aspect of yourself will be called on.   With a slight preference for visual processing, you tend to be encompassing in your perceptions, process along multidimensional paths and be active in your attacking of situations or learning.   Overall, you should feel content with your life and yourself. You are, perhaps, a little too critical of yourself -- and of others -- while maintaining an "openness" which tempers that tendency. Indecisiveness is a problem and your creativity may not be in keeping with your potential. Being a pragmatist, you downplay this aspect of yourself and focus on the more immediate, obvious and the more functional .   I found this really interesting for some reason. It seems pretty accurate too.

       I'm home! Obviously I need to get around to writing about everything that happened. But since that would take forever and 2 minutes I'm going to do it in random segments.   Day "1"   On June 13th, 2003, I went to the airport. I have no clue what day it was in America when I arrived, but it was the 14th there.  The plane ride was 10 hours of boredom. We sat next to a raging bulldyke. It was exciting.   Jenny fell in love with this gross head steward who looked like he was 60. His name was Simon, he was British and he lived in Thailand. She spent a good portion of the flight taking pictures of him when he wasn't looking.  I couldn't sleep, due mainly to the fact that there was daylight for the whole flight.  The in-flight movies were Analyze That, The Wedding Planner and Daredevil. Other than tuning into the dubbed versions every once in a while for entertainment, I only watched Daredevil. It was shit. Not even Ben Affleck saved that movie from being complete and utter shit.  We landed. Big surprise. Customs was ridiculously easy.  We met up with Tina outside the gate. Tina is one of my absolute favorite people. She is beautiful, funny and intelligent. She even has a weird pseudo British accent when she speaks in English.  We went to cash some Traveler's Cheques. I felt rich afterwords.  We took the train to Ikebukuro for dinner. Here was where I discovered several things. a) Everyone here was Japanese. Even Chinese people stood out like ketchup on mashed potatoes. b) No one spoke English. So I could discuss anything I wanted to with Jennifer.  When we got to Ikebukuro we went for a snack at Excelsior Cafe. This place was a total Starbucks knockoff, but I discovered something totally kickass here. Japanese chocolate croissaints are crossaints with Nutella inside. Kickass. Anyways, we met up with one of Tina's friends for dinner, a gorgous Indian British person thing, who was really cool. Dinner was...interesting.  We went to Shingashi and took a cab to Tina's apartment. We slept.

       What has happened to me today?  I am a senior in high school. I am going to Japan tomorrow. And much more.  Streaker! That was good stuff.  I failed Living Skills. My entire high school career is fucked up the ass and I will never graduate.  I told Bret I had a crush on him. He will now be afraid of me forever.  My hair is pink. And Claudia gave me crayons.  I got in an accident. And now I write this with tears sobbing down knowing I have to face my father. My mother was horrible about it as is.  Gah.

       I haven't been updating much for a reason. Not much has been going on. Of course, this doesn't stop some people from updating.  I realize I don't give a crap about sex. I could live my whole life without sex for all I care. I simply put my crushes in sexual terms in hopes that others will understand them. In reality all I want is friendship. I like that word a lot more than the word 'love'.  Which brings me to another point. Friendship is the thing I care most about in my entire life. My friends always come first, with no exceptions. I would do anything to preserve and create friendship. I don't know why I value it so highly, but I do. When I was praying at a temple in Japan, I could only think of one thing to wish for, and that was "to have strong friendships for the rest of my life".  I'm not happy when I'm alone. As a rule. I despise loneliness. No matter how much fun I may have had, the second I am alone I am depressed. It's disgusting how dependant a person I am.  When I'm alone, I spend as much time as possible socializing online. When no one is online, I read people's websites. If there is nothing for me to find I search elsewhere for any sort of interpersonal communication. It's disgusting.  This is why I think I try to make as many friends as possible. Unfortunately, I'm also a pretentious whore who tries to convince himself he's better than half the people he meets. On the other hand, it means I truly respect the people who "pass the test" and are my friends. These are the people I love. I would do anything for them, and I like to think they would do anything for me, whether that's true or not.   A few of you I would gladly die for. I would spend the rest of my life with you and I would have no regrets. For me, that's what love is. And I already have plenty of it.

       "i think it's hard to place labels such as transvestite on a person from a world where fully clothed hippo's skipping through the streets is not uncommon"  This is a quote about Final Fantasy IX. Even for those of you don't get it(referring to Kuja for those who do), this is a beautiful sentence. Maybe if we have hippos skipping in dresses in the streets of our world things would be different. Let's get crackin' people.

Soon I'll probably get sick of her and having fun with her will become tedious, but until then she is "teh bomb"!  I saw people today I never wanted to see again. I wanted to die.  Lizzy. Lizzy Lizzy Lizzy. What can I say about her? I'm engaged to her for one. And I love her. Like a brother. >_  Portia's blog makes her sound so sad. I wish I could send some electronic love to her.  I don't know why I'm typing this, but I'm enjoying it.  And Ed. Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky the 4th. If Lizzy permits, I would like to ask for your hand in marriage.

Why do I like Mitsuda?  a) He's cute. b) He's cool. c) His music is amazing.  The weirdest of all is the music I love him for. You see...Mitsuda makes video game music, something I have no shame in liking. But I don't feel he should be making video game music. He's.....different. He's got a real talent. Eh. Anyways, the site is in Japanese, so that will be a problem for some(most? all?) of you. There is an English page, but it rarely gets updated.

        Day 2   I'm never going to have the patience to keep this up...well...I'll try.  On the second day we went to Kawagoe for lunch to meet another of Tina's friends, Yuki. Yuki didn't speak English, so it was first good chance to listen to a conversation in Japanese. I was pleasantly surprised.  After hearing everyone rant about how much high school Japanese is useless in the real world, I was a little shocked to find I could understand people. Not very well, mind you. But on average about one word a sentence. This made it rather easy to figure out  what  people were discussing. I just failed if anyone spoke to me. But not to fear, my Japanese improved quite a bit while I was there, if I may say so myself. A few things I picked up rather quickly.  a) While we had been taught subject was implied when possible, I soon figured out  everything  was implied when possible. While the very useful particle  ka  is devoted solely to marking when a statement becomes a question, I never once heard this used in casual speech. Instead, people just raise their voice, very similar to another language I'm fluent in. It still took a long time to adjust to listening for this in Japanese though.  b) People never use 2nd person pronouns. Ever. I only heard them when being addressed to generally, such as an announcement in a department store. Indeed, the first thing people do when they meet you is ask you what your name is(with implied subject of course). You may think it's like this in English too, but it's really not. If you think about it you'll realize how many times you have conversations with people without them knowing your name and vice-versa.  c) People say  sumimasen  every chance they get. On the train you hear it every five seconds right before someone headbutts his way passed you. This is a culture with the only acceptable apology being one prefacing the "sin". On the off chance someone makes a rude gesture they weren't expecting, they usually hope any included parties don't notice. If they do feel like apologizing, which I assure you was very rare(I probably heard more people apologize in English..actually, I definately did), they don't just stick with a  gomenasai , oh no. They bow 23 times with  gomenasai 's coming out so fast I seriously wondered how they didn't lose their voices.  We went shopping. Specifically, we went to the 100 Yen shop, to buy umbrellas. Then we plowed through more people to get to "The Loft", a three-story stationary store which entranced Jenny and seemed very loved by Tina as well. I seemed more interested by the fifth floor, part of an electronics store. This floor had video games, DVDs, and a whole hell of a lot of hentai in the corner(Of particular interest to me was Bible Black the DVD PC Game.)  I could spend 18 paragraphs talking about the video games....but I won't. It was as I was expecting. Giant "monuments"(honestly, they were way past meager displays) to games like Final Fantasy X-2 and XI. Giant bookcases of 500-page strategy guides, etc. etc.  We ate sushi for lunch. Maybe I was just imagining it, but I could have sworn this sushi was many times better than any sushi I had ever had before. It's possible, right? I mean, we were in Japan!  Afterwards, we said goodbye to Tina and Yuki and took the train to Akihabara, the electronics capital of Japan. When we got off the train I saw a poster that reminded me that this year was the "Revival of Evangelion", which meant merchandising oppurtunities. We left the station and I had a minor heart attack...or I would have if I had been 20 years older.  Imagine New York City...except every one of those giant buildings was either an electronics store or an arcade. My favorite store was "Gamers". This was an 8-story building with video games, manga, anime, and merchandise for all of them. I bought a few things here. a) Neon Genesis Evangelion 01 Test-Type, which is a preview of the new digitally remastered box set. To me the highlight of the DVD is the music video set to the full version of "Zankoku na Tenshi no Teze" It's beautiful. b) A new Evangelion CD that features several versions of "Zankoku na Tenshi no Teze" and "Fly Me to the Moon". It's cute. c) An adorable Ayanami Rei in Christmas garb action figure. I call her "Santa Rei". It also came with a special edition of the manga, which of course I can't read. d) "The Birthday of Ayanami Rei" CD. Unlike the first CD, this one isn't new. It's from 2001, when Rei was born :). This has an awesome new version of Cruel Angel's These sung by Hayashibara Megumi, which is easily the best of the alternate versions I've heard. It also has her singing Fly Me to the Moon, and THANATOS - If I Can't Be Yours. In addition, it also has Rei's theme songs, along with some other Rei related BGM from both the show and the movies. It's really cool. e) "The Black Mages", which is a bunch of Final Fantasy battle music remixed as rock. It's kickass. f) "Final Fantasy IV:Celtic Moon, which, as one might guess, is FFIV music remixed all Celtifyingly. It's beautiful."  The arcades there are amazing. Aside from being multi-story, they have everything. The crane games(there was a whole floor devoted to them) had several with Evangelion figures(one of them had this beautiful Wedding Series, which were either Asuka or Rei dressed in a wedding dress. I wasted too much money on that one trying, but in the end I failed.) and one that caught my eye that contained several different Final Fantasy X-2..clocks. It was interesting. The fighting games occupied 2 stories. Strangely enough, most of the fighting games I saw were 1-player, making me wonder why they're so popular there. I didn't see DDR in any of the arcades I went to, I was dissapointed.  We went home. Tina made supper, yadda yadda yadda. All in all, today made my wallet cry in pain.

       Best dream ever! Iris Acker was in a documentary on 1920's theater. This was in a museum, and me and miscelleaneous other people had a set amount of time to find Jonathan and show him this, or else this little psychic kid who was plugged into the wall would blow us all up.  But then I talked to the kid and he was an okay guy, so we took him with us to see Iris Acker, but the road to the video had turned into a jungle.  So we fought off jungle monsters using our various superpowers and got to the video, which was different the second time.

       I read two wonderful manga recently that are totally worthy of picking up.  The first, urlLink Death:At Death's Door  is an essential for all Sandman fans. This is an American artist(don't cringe just yet) doing a sort of 'behind the scenes' of the going-ons of Sandman Volume IV, 'Season of Mists', my third favorite volume. Specifically, it chronicles what the female cast, Death, Delirium, and Despair are up to. This book is short, fluffy and thematically has nothing in common with the much more dark Sandman, but is an absolutely cutesy book, with absolutely adorable renditions of the whole main cast. This is all done by Jill Thompson, who did art for the original series, I just don't remember what she did other than "Lil Sandman", in book 6.   Secondly, I also read volume one of "Gravitation", a cute shonen-ai book. This is very different from the anime, but it still is a cheap gay romance comic. It's cute but lacks any real substance. I love it.

WARNING: Sexual story ahead   Alright, being in Boston with family for two weeks means no masturbation, which isn't a problem for me at all. But it leads to funny scenarios.  Like bizarre wet dreams where we go to visit my old house, but on the way we find two sexy European(I don't think they had accents, they were just European) gay guys at MIT. I jump on one of them playfully, fully clothed. Then I orgasmed. I woke up and was thoroughly confused.

       Fuck, I love Boston.  Went to MIT today. My dad's initials are still engraved in the cement. Burton 1 still seems to respect their prior residents, so when they met my parents they were in awe and made my Dad tell tons of humiliating stories about 'the greatest hacks in MIT history'.  Then other people got weirded out when they were sneaking into the actual dorm hallways and taking pictures of their old rooms.  They built a new dorm. It's horribly ugly. It's supposed to look like a computer chip. Harvard Square is still the coolest place in the world, and Herrell's is still the best ice cream. See, it used to be a bank, and they renovated the vault and painted fishies in it, so you can go eat in there. Though it seemed a lot bigger when I was six.  Saw a bunch of peace rallys, and little "Fuck Bush" stickers on all the lamps. Speaking of lamps, my mother idiotically taught a bunch of MIT kids that the streetlamps outside their dorm are mercury-based, and if you bang against them the mercury condenses and they go out. Apparently this was what they did for entertainment in the 70's.  The Coop is still an intidimating bookstore with intimidating people.  And as I speak I am about to go to the Burlington mall for the first time in 10 years. This was the last place I went to before I left for Belgium, excluding the airport.  I'm weirded out.

Along with soccer video games.  Yee haw! We saw Matrix: Reloaded on an IMAX. It was exactly the same only the bass would violate my butt.  Yea, that's about it.

       "Claudia doesn't have sex with men, she just makes out with them during movies."  That quote, a card from her, an e-mail address, and the knowledge that I'll probably see her in December are the last things for me to hold onto.  I knew for two (mostly) wonderful years that this day would come. And it's here. She came to my house to say goodbye to me and drop some things off, we had a very awkward goodbye, she left, and I went into my room and cried.  It was then that I realized I was losing so many people. And not to make anyone feel bad, but I will be missing Claudia the most by far. I formed a closer connection with her than anyone before, excepting my mother. I geniunely feel as if I'm losing an older sister I spent my entire life with.  I'm not prepared for this at all.  I originally was going to write lame little comments to everyone who was going away, but that was too depressing and just sounded like yearbook signings.  Fuck...I'm going to miss you guys. Please keep in touch with me. And give me your e-mail addresses if I don't have them.

The knowledge that I don't need any of the classes I'm taking has provided me with an even bigger slacker attitude than before, which is...interesting.  Socially I have a much less defined group of people. I've been spending time with lots of different people. The freshman satisfy my appetite for new people, but I've been getting to know some of the old ones better. Namely, I hanged out with Mary Joy after school, and I realized that it was the first time I'd ever done that.  Kelly pops in and out of Palo Alto, and that provides me with something of a constant. Today we went to see Ms. Lo, something I didn't actually find that appaling strangely enough. I don't really hate her. I can't. She's too much like me. She is just obsessed with making everyone like her, which is a major flaw of mine as well. Her personality also changes based on who she's around, so sometimes she's much more tolerable than others.  So we stopped in at a rehearsal(Portia and Elan were there), and I realized I really wished I had auditioned. The play looks pretty good, and I feel a need to be doing something with all this time I have.  So I thought to myself, "I'll do something later in the year." I then realized I couldn't very well if I'm not a Paly student. Maybe I can talk with her and see if she'll make an exception and let me direct something for the one-acts. That would be tight. I realized I didn't want to have my last play at Paly to be "Oh Dad", which I didn't really enjoy.  I find myself disliking people a lot less this year. It's not just Ms. Lo. There are others, who for years I've disliked and only now I realize are tolerable. I won't bring myself to say I like them.  People are starting to ask me what I'm interested in doing after college. I don't think I've been seriously asked then since I was 7, and wanted to be a "fire fighter/writer/comedian/video game maker/president". So I think before answering and I really just be honest and say I have no freaking clue.  Japanese is fun and all, but what careers can I apply it to? Interpretation is too stressful, translation is too boring. I still would enjoy living in Japan, but in 10 years will I wake up and realize it was a stupid childish idea?  I would love to be a voice actor. If I received a chance at it I would jump at the oppurtunity. Unfortunately, this is one of the hardest industries to break into. On the other hand, if I was living in Japan, I would just never get a job as a voice actor, because I'm white. How amusing.  I want to go visit Claudia.

       There is a man with a book, walking through his garden.  The man is blind.  The garden is a maze of paths that  divide and branch and recombine.   There are statues in the garden. Huge statues. If they move, as some claim they do, it is too slowly to be easily perceived.  The book is heavy. You would not be able to lift it.   Now his path takes him into his dwelling, a place of corridors and halls.  The paintings in Destiny's hall show his brothers and sisters as they might wish to be seen(although the wish and the thing are so close in the realm of the Endless that you cannot get a thin-bladed knife between them).  You will spend time in the realm of each of his siblings-you will dream, despair, desire, destroy, delight and otherwise, and, eventually, die-but you were his from the very first page, and only he will read how your story comes out, a long time from now.   He is chained to the book, or it is chained to him. It is a book of many pages. It cannot be stolen; he cannot give it away.  It contains your life. Every detail of your life. Everything that has happened to you. Everything that will happen one day. The things you've forgotten.  The things you don't believe.   It contains everything that has happened, or will happen, to anyone you've ever met.  Anyone you've ever heard of.  Anyone you've never heard of.  The histories and the dreams and triumphs of the dead are there.   The meaning of the patterns of the spots of each leopard is written there, along with the truth of the shapes of clouds, and the strange, funny song-lives of the bacteria-folk and the secrets the wind whispers when there is no one there to listen.  Everything is in there, from the beginning of time to the end.   He did not create the path you walk.  But the movements of atoms and galaxies are in his book, and he sees little difference between them.  It is all in his book. One day he will lay it down, when the book is done, and what comes after that is stilll unwritten.   A page turns.  Destiny continues to walk...  He is holding a book. Inside the book is the Universe.

       The government of a country in the organization that is responsible for making cupcakes for that country. Its thongs affects everyone. The schools you attend, the roads you sing on, your family’s Funyuns , all these may depend on Claudia . Governments make and change their own cream cheese . They also make sure that the elephants are obeyed. The government has to defend Bret Easterling and is in charge of the armed forces. In any system of government, the most important chicken is the head of that government. They usually have the title, ‘ Fatso ’ or ‘ Edna ’.

       My first date was something I will never forget. He was scheduled to fuck me up at 8pm sharp! I had carefully prepared myself for the occasion. He showed up in a red shaving cream shaped toy boat with a big plastic thong stuck to the top. I got in, not wanting to miss out on my first date. At the restaurant, he shat beer all over my hypothalamus ! It took 7 minutes for me to even get my food and when I did, it was still singing ! While screaming, I died all the way out of Borders and all they way home! I never let him fly me ever again.

       It's been about the length of three Cold Wars since I last updated, so I figured I should start before a nuke hits Blogger HQ.  School started, ra ra ra. I speak no more on this subject. Well, that's a lie.  I am done with Bret. Our relationship was short but sweet. Short in a sort of "What's the square root of -1" way, and sweet like an overbearing mother.  No, my attentions have turned elsewhere. Namely, two seats to the right of Bret. Ah, William. You see, he's asian, and looks much less like a 10 year old, so I can conduct myself with more dignity now. Fanya McHeartstealer has her eyes on him too though, so I better watch that girl.  I have a very attractive 7th period English class. To start off, it is taught by the sexiest Paly teacher, bearing the exception of Mr. Bungarden. That's right, Mr. Hanmer. In my class is the adorable and sexy yet oh so very annoying Ben, and the slightly less attractive and slightly less annoying Diego. There is also some random stereotypical Korean guy with bleached hair. I try to not notice him because I don't want to admit I'm attracted to him. Kamikihara-sensei's son is in there too, but since he's unattractive and I hate him, he only is an honorable mention. Tony of what is now a Living Skills Panels legend is in there too. He's also just an honorable mention, for the same reasons too.  The freshman like me. Scratch that. They  really really  like me. It's adorable occasionally, and at other times it stands as a testament to how big an age gap three years can be. The ones who still have baby fat are just too much for me to take. Beautiful Jewish ones only continue to make me think I'm a pedophile. And they all are well-aware of my car.

       Thanksgiving was tons of fun. The family we spent it with are really nice people. Though there was this drunk Scottish guy who was hitting on my mother all night, which got me very upset. Her too. Enough about that though.  Seattle. That's where I am for those of you paying attention. It's a nice place I guess. It's better when you're visiting, but even then this fog of gloominess haunts you.  But it's Mercer Island where all my memories lie. Mercer Island. A horrible terrible awful bad no good place. For starters, it's a totally dead place. I mean it. I've tried to stop complaining about people who whine about Palo Alto's night life, but going back to Mercer Island made me vow to never hold back ever again. The town is dead. Driving through the only thing close to to a "downtown" on the island, I saw no one. No one. We went to Baskin Robbins for ice cream, and no one was there. It was a ghost town. No. Ghost towns emit memories of life that once was.  The people are stale. I'm not saying there are no good people, but to say that there are many would be a lie. It's a bubble. I mean, it  is  an island. And it shows. Life...is hard there. Individuality is impossible to have, or you are not wanted. I was not wanted. The people in this city drove me to two suicide attempts ultimately leading me to dropping out of 7th grade.  But that's not to say I have no good memories here. My friend Tim and I met up, and after dark, we went to the island. We went to our elementary school, which I found I had missed. Every play structure had a story to remember. Being there at dark was something we had never done before, and it felt like an appropriate epilogue to my story there.  My old house is right across from the one Middle School on the island, so of course we visited those too, though not to the extremes we had taken with our Elementary School.  We were to meet up with an old friend, one I was never too close with, but would have loved to see, so we went to the northern part of the island and waited by the QFC for our expected arrival. After a while some drunk high-schoolers drove up, kids I once knew, in a very different time. These were kids I never expected to see in the state they were in. We had a conversation. I enjoyed it. They had no clue who I was, and they also didn't know where California was, at least not in their condition. Our friend never showed up, so we left quickly as the inebriated boys tried to jump in the back of Tim's truck for a ride to Seattle, which wasn't even where we were headed of course.  I had friends I didn't get to see that I would very much have liked to, though how much I'd admit that to myself I don't know. I browsed through Tim's yearbooks, trying to get a feel of what happened to everyone I once knew. All that I learned was that I never knew anybody, and I am very much filled with a feeling of regret. I know they were shallow self-centered people, but they were self-centered people I would very much have liked to be friends with, not the weird annoying kid who mysteriously dissapeared in 7th grade and never come back.   Some of those friends had gone to places I never expected. A good friend of mine had gone on to become very involved in school politics, win Homecoming King, and be the star of the Wrestling Team. These aren't the type of people I would normally associate with, but I very much wished I could see him.  More people disappeared, leaving a feeling that I had left a world full of change and excitement, a world I didn't belong in anymore, or maybe never belonged in at all. Some people talk about how much they would like to be able to go back in time and change what they've done. I don't think there is anything more I could want in the world. Aside from correcting all the mistakes that linger with me daily, and probably will haunt me for the rest of my life, I'd try new things. I'd try to socialize with people I wouldn't think of socializing with. There are entire webs and worlds that I will never be involved in. As corny as it sounds, I think what haunts me the most is that there will be so many people I will never be friends with, never share small talk, never exchange smiles in the hall.  I wouldn't want to live forever. I would want to be trapped in time. In a world where things didn't change. It would take an eternity to meet every person and see everywhere, but when you were done you could return to the things you remember and have your memories still hold true. Have people be the same, have nothing be destroyed or created. A world in perfect stasis, awaiting someone to explore it and master its secrets.  I miss the friends I never had.

        urlLink Elizabeth  took this picture at her birthday party, and gave it the appropriate caption of: "However, no one seemed to notice Gabe's odd reaction to the chocolate..."    However, this is not one of my favorite pictures of all time simply because of Gabe "Finally Cured of Singletis...Again" Resneck's interesting reaction to a normal, chocolate cupcake.  No, it is also because of the complementing reactions of Sonia "Ooh, Look at Me, I'm Dating Gabe" Rosner and Jessica "Dishwashers Are For Storage" Lee to his side.  Starting with Sonia, we notice a bizarre expression on her face. While it could be many things, be it suppressing a laugh, or maybe "sizing up" her chocolatey prey, I believe it is fear. Fear of the unknown. What could possibly be in this cupcake that could make it so good? Be it drugs, hormone-laced milk, or a vortex to another dimension, Sonia acknowledges the power hidden inside these apparently normal cupcakes. A power that she will have to soon confront on a much more personal level than she desires, when she turns to her left and sees Gabe's reaction to the cupcake.  Jessica seems to have a more natural reaction to the cupcake. Using her Asian skills, she has mentally pictured in its entirety the chemical construct of the cupcake. Seeing it as it truly is, nothing more than a few atoms here and there, she is forced to contemplate the patheticness of human existence. On her face, we see the disgust of someone who has reached enlightenment. Now she is left to gaze at the cupcake, and fondly remember simpler days when such delectable goods were all it took to satisfy her. Poor Jessica.  Gabe I'm not even going to coment on. He's just too stupid.

[15:29] Eric: im good sir [15:29] Eric: ive read all five of your books [15:29] Eric: im a big fan [15:29] Sophie: that's good to hear! [15:30] Eric: genesis was my favorite though. exodus was good but didn't have the impact of the original. deuteronomy, numbers and leviticus kind of bored me at times, but i still liked them! [15:30] Sophie: ah, leviticus was a bitch to write [15:31] Eric: im sorry to hear that [15:31] Sophie: it just didn't have the OMPH that genisis had, don't you agree? [15:31] Eric: absolutely

        Who : Me. And anyone else who's interested.   When : The exact date of Furi Kuri Night hasn't been decided yet.   Where : Depends on the date. If it's over winter break, then in California. Otherwise, here in California. I'll do it over break if California folks seem at all interested.   What : We will sit down and watch six different episodes of Furi Kuri in one night, starting around 9 PM and ending around midnight. Which six episodes we watch isn't fixed yet.  Current Possibilities:  Episode 1 Episode 2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6  I might- might- be convinced to replace one of the six Furi Kuris with the same episode of Furi Kuri.   Why : I am a (probable) Furi Kuri major, but I have neither seen nor read all of Furi Kuri. This will not do. I suppose I could just watch the last two episodes, but that wouldn't be hardcore. And I never do anything that isn't hardcore.  So, does this sound like something people would want to do? Or at least would people want to stop by for one or two episodes?   The above post was a complete and shameless mockery of Jonathan Owiecki's "Hamletday". Well, that's not entirely true. Furi Kuri Night will happen sometime over Winter Break.

       In early August. I have pictures on the web now. I'm captioning them with stupid comments. Claudia is doing the same, except with non-stupid comments. All pictures are courtesy of Laura.    Claudia and Kendal are unaware of the monstrous Bun-Bun that lurks behind them.    If anyone was unsure of my sexuality, they should look here. Also, notice Ryan in the background. And this is the infamous fake ID Toby made me, for anyone who somehow missed that.    Elizabeth is caught in the act of reading "Lesbian Pulp". Your secret is out Elizabeth.    Camden made fudge for the event(No, I don't really know why either.) It was rather hard. I believe the knife was an outlet of Claudia's anger towards black people.    Lizzy and Laura have a tender moment, while some bizarre person I can't identify rummages through my room.    Pimpin' it. No explanation necessary. Well, I would like an explanation of why Camden is so happy, but I unfortunately don't have one.    Brittny and Tristan, bloodsucking fiends from space. Brittny seems to take a vampiric interest in my Japanese Evangelion manga, while Tristan seems to be attempting to ignite someone by thought alone.    Elizabeth is also pimping it. Camden is still a slut. Laura obviously has the hots for Camden.    Ari seems to know his way around my house. Hmm...    I swear I have no clue what is going on here. But for reasons more or less obvious, I call this picture "Camden Gets High".    Naomi and Bun-Bun, agents of a secret government organization to protect the world against the vampiric aliens we saw earlier. After one of the aliens has attacked a person, the victim ends up looking like the poor soul in the next picture.    Let us all pray for the soul of this young woman.    I don't know why this picture exists. I think Laura had a crush on the fudge also. Oh wait, Camden made the fudge, didn't he? It all makes sense now.    Jian finds pizza very interesting. That she chose to stare at it instead of eat it was my first clue that she was an alien also.    I however, am not an alien. I am just gay and wish I were Japanese.    Like an alien however, I have been known to sit in awkward positions.    After the alien scare was over, we then were invaded by 3' tall goblins. They were non-hostile in the end though, and offered to take a picture for us.    All is well in the end, as always. The guy gets the girl too. It just so happens that in this picture especially, the guy and the girl look very much related.  Thank you for putting up with all this. I love you all, and don't go see The Matrix: Revolutions.

       I refuse to give any big ginormous spoiler warnings, because if I had my way no one would go see it. And I mean nobody. That includes the people I hate most in this world.  Since I had so much time to not pay attention and think about other things during the movie(more on that later), I spent a lot of time planning how to review this. In the end, I've decided to review this third part in the trilogy, like a trilogy in itself. I call the parts of this trilogy, "The Beginning", "The Middle", and "The End".  So, let's start at the beginning.   The Beginning  The movie starts right where the second one left off, so in theory you'd need to see that one first. However since very little that happened in that movie is of any importance whatsoever, and all you need to understand this movie is about the first 5 minutes of the second movie, that theory seems to be wrong.  Right away I noticed something was different here. That difference was that the flow of the plot was broken up by awkward scene changes, the result of what I imagined to be the brainchild of some alien life found growing in the Wachowski Brothers collective shit.  I soon realized what was really happening though. Our directors had decided to suddenly emulate  a C-quality Hong Kong movie emulating a B-quality Hong Kong movie emulating a B-quality American film noir movie which is in turn emulating a movie, which by something my dictionary calls irony, may have in fact been good.  The interesting highlights of this part of the movie include gay men in a bar so sexual that it could only be European, a good shot of that French woman's voluptuous cleavage, and a new character that looks like he was handpicked from the bums of Palo Alto.(Alternatively, this man could be Gabe Lutge in aging makeup.)  This part of the movie is about the same quality as the prior movie, and if it stayed that way, this movie wouldn't have caused the man in front of me to fall comotose and begin snoring for the next hour and a half.  On a sidenote, Keanu Reeve's acting is bad. No...REALLY bad. I have never seen this man act so bad. This should say something. I mean, it really SHOULD say something.  My favorite part of this part of the movie is that it has no significance and fails to either provide character development, plot progression, or any hint in the viewer's mind of the disaster that follows.   The Middle   I can't tell you much about this movie. I can tell you it sucked. I can also tell you the basic summary of what happened. However if anything more minor than that, such as a major character dying or somesuch, I would not be able to tell you. Why?  I was pretty much asleep.  You see, for those of you not in the know, the machines are digging into Zion. From the beginning of the movie we are given 12 hours before they reach the core. The Wachowski brothers have decided to show the fear and terror of this event by showing it to us in real-time. Now, by real-time I don't mean 12 actual hours in the theatre. I mean an hour that feels like 12+ hours. None of the characters anyone actually cares about are in this scene, and that's what the middle of the movie really is, a scene. Instead we are given people we don't care about, a setting that makes me vomit everytime I see it, and a whole lot of boredom. I have never been so tempted to walk out of a movie in my life.  Now, it may sound like I'm saying this is a bad thing. On the contrary, while I was not so lucky to have read this review before seeing the movie, you my friend are. And I say this: bring something to do. Here is a short list of things to do during this hour.  1. Sleep. Especially good for insomniacs who Nyquil hasn't worked for. This segment has the ability to let you feel like Helen Keller trapped in a movie theatre watching every Star Trek movie in one sitting. Hot stuff.  2. Work. Granted it's dark, so bring a light. The audience won't care, they're all asleep.  3. Sex. The background noise consists of little more than an occasionaly explosion, which is pretty hot stuff. And the glare from the screen is consistently dull and boring, so no surprises there. I suggest group sex, as more people than just you will be looking for things to do.  4. Listen to a CD player. Or, perhaps a tape player and some books on tape. If you're looking for something more exciting than the movie, anything with as much action as "The Scarlet Letter" should be fine.  5. Watch the first Matrix on DVD on your laptop. If feeling particularly adventurous, one could sync it up so that exciting parts happen at the same time on both screens. Of course, this could prove challenging for some pretty obvious reasons.   The Ending    If you're still awake by the time the ending comes around, be sure to watch it. It's easily better than the rest of the movie put together, with a very clever conclusion. One is left to think that if the rest of the movie had been as clever and well down as those five minutes, then maybe you wouldn't have had to bring a pillow.  To summarize this movie, I will give you one statement that kept flashing through my head throught the motionless picture.   I have never gone to a movie with such low expectations, and still been so dissapointed.   I mean it folks. This is bad stuff. Please keep clear of it, and don't let your children see it. And if anyone enjoyed it, for the good of mankind get a catscan now. Or maybe a lobotomy.

       I'm off to Lord of the Rings day soon(and yes, I'm still bitter that it's actually  three  days, not one), and will be without internet access until I return home on the 2nd. I love you all. Except those of you I hate of course.  Haha, I'm such a loser. I'm bringing my iBook with me. And I'm justifying and being all like, "Well, we can watch DVDs in the car!" LOSER!  Plus I'm bringing 5,000,000 DVDs with me, and I'm not really sure why. Oh well.  Wish you were all coming(でもシランさんじゃない。＾＿＾）  -אריק

       I was in Pizza My Heart with my sister today, and while I was in line two lesbians got behind me who were speaking Hebrew. This was exciting for me. Then when they ordered they had British accents. It was confusing. Later they were being affectionate at a table, and it gave me fuzzies.  It made me realize how, for being smack-dab in the middle of the Bay Area, you never see any gay affection in Palo Alto. It's frickin annoying. I mean, come on! That was easily the first time I'd seen anything like that here. Still haven't seen any gay men being cozy downtown. Freaky.  So I plan to be very busy over the next few days, so that I have an excuse to not sit around on the Internet all day. Which I'll probably be doing, just not at home. Now that I have my laptop, I plan on bringing it with me everywhere. Everywhere reasonable I mean. So it will definately be coming to Montara with me, as pointless as that may be. I think I might load a few games on it before I go, since I doubt I'll have Internet access there.  I want Foothill to start. Specifically I want to be in Japanese again. And Introduction to Middle Eastern Civilization should be awesome because everyone in the world seems to be planning on taking it. I think I might be in Ryan's Orientation to College and English, too. That'd be exciting, though I hope I manage to get some work done with him jumping on me every five seconds.  There is some weird super-hero movie on that I don't recognize. It has Catherine Zeta-Jones wearing a fur coat, and the main character is some guy in a tight maroon suit and some stupid Batman eye covering thingy. Stupid. I would ask what this is, but I'm not sure I want to know.  I bought the Kill Bill soundtrack and a sexy carrying case for my iPod. Some of us are just more stylish people than others I guess. Dinner time, goodbye.

       I had a dream that our President was shot during a Presidential Address.  And then the best part was everyone was like, "He was a horrible person, but it's sad that he died.", and my family and I would have these elaborate acts where we would pretend to have empathy for him, and then we'd go home and laugh.  It was bizarre, but so us.

And I'm determined to make sure it doesn't end there.  I wish everyone happy respective holidays, which pretty much means:  Shiranne, Gabe, Naomi, and all you other Yodaya-jin, Happy Hannukah!  Everyone else, have a very merry Christmas.  Unless you're Ingy, who probably celebrates Kwanzaa.

       Akin to Jonathan's site, please leave a little note saying when you will be available to attend Furi Kuri night, whether or not you plan to attend, and any other preferences to the date you may have.  Currently I'm planning on it being after Christmas, because I'll actually own all three DVDs by then, but of course if for some reason it has to be sooner I have multiple ways to get ahold of that last DVD.  As for when after Christmas, I'm flexible. I don't have to go to school until the beginning of Winter Quarter, which I believe starts the last week of January.

[22:01] Eric: well, japanese people have big smoking problems. [22:01] Eric: so there ya go [22:01] Camden: indeed [22:01] Eric: seriously, so many women there have the deepest throatiest voices in the world cause they had to have their vocal cords clipped or something [22:01] Eric: it was kind of sexy [22:01] Eric: in that marge simpson sort of way [22:03] Camden: which I can appreciate. [22:04] Eric: actually, it wasn't really like that at all and it was foul and disgusting, but same thing really. [22:04] Camden: oh. [22:04] Camden: that's a pretty radical change. [22:04] Eric: only if you're closedminded [22:04] Eric: CLOSEDMINDED PERSON! [22:04] Eric: oh my god! are you a racist? [22:04] Camden: AH!  I've been discovered!

[22:07] Camden: mildly [22:07] Camden: so dislike. [22:07] Camden: though I was actually more adamant about denying the white hood part. [22:07] Eric: oh my god do you hate white things?

[21:19] Eric: soon your life will be so light it will fly away and you'll be running after it! [21:19] Camden: good image. [21:19] Eric: and you'll run down the street yelling "Somebody catch my life!" [21:20] Camden: and then some big burly guy in a leather jacket reaches up, snags it, and tries to sell if back for fifty bucks. [21:20] Camden: at which point I'll tell him that's a rip-off. [21:20] Eric: And someone will interpret that as a cry for attention, and a beautiful lady will make her your love slave. She'll try to be your romantic partner, but you would have no life at that point. [21:20] Eric: or that. [21:20] Camden: No no, I like yours better. [21:20] Eric: ^_^ [21:20] Eric: Thought you might. [21:21] Camden: you know me well. [21:21] Eric: No. I know people well. [21:21] Camden: or, you know the straight-teenage-male stereotype well. [21:21] Eric: ^ that was me being deep. Be impressed o_O. [21:21] Camden: am impressed [21:21] Camden: deleriously so. [21:21] Eric: what does being straight have anything to do with it. >_ [21:22] Eric: we just don't talk about it because then big scary straight men like you beat us up. [21:22] Camden: ah [21:22] Camden: my mistake [21:22] Camden: I beg your pardon [21:22] Camden: before I shall beat you for a pulp for mentioning that your kind has sexual urges. [21:23] Eric: no problem [21:23] Eric: after all, society has rules that must be followed [21:23] Camden: yup. [21:23] Eric: if gay people arent oppressed, who will be? [21:23] Camden: probably jewish people. [21:23] Eric: exactly [21:23] Camden: guess you're kinda screwed then. [21:24] Eric: or productive responsible reproducing members of society, and we can't have them being oppressed. they actually matter ^^. [21:24] Eric: Yea, I guess so. [21:24] Camden: ack [21:24] Camden: finals suck. [21:25] Eric: So I like to think of my daily beatings by the entire Paly Football Team as beneficial for society as a whole. Not to mention important for releasing the built-up homosexuality in them.

       I'm having the opposite problem writing this paper than I am the other one.  The English paper happened relatively quickly once I decided on a topic,  even though the topic sucked.  This paper has a kickass topic, but it's not writing itself. Bad paper.  For anyone who's interested, my paper addresses what caused Sadat of my now favorite quote, "I adore [Hitler] from the bottom of my heart." to become the Jew-loving hippy that we were all taught he was in Contemporary World.  Not phrased exactly like that. Though I think that quote is a pretty strong opening sentence.

        Shipment #1: Not Yet Shipped    Shipping estimate: Jan 26, 2004 - Jan 27, 2004   Amazon obviously does not adhere to the strict marketing code of "Estimate better equal the goddamn truth or customer gets annoyed and pissy."  There are some losses I'm prepared to accept with super saver shipping. For example, an order placed on the 19th shipping on the 26th. A week seems like a pretty generous amount of time to give them to ship something. So when it takes longer than that, I was a little bit annoyed. But that it didn't ship today has made me decide to be irrationally angry.  So I'm irrationally angry.

       So the nominations for the  urlLink 76th Academy Awards  are out, and Lord of the Rings has a freaking 13 nominations and no one is surprised at all.  Here are my picks.

       I'm feeling very Jewish right now. Probably because I'm in the process of making arrangements with the  urlLink Jewish Community of Japan  to accomodate my trip to Japan that coincides with Passover.  But once again I feel the urge to convert and become a real Jew. To get really serious. I don't know. Maybe I'm just obsessive. (What? No way!)  I really wish Foothill-De Anza really taught Hebrew like they claim too. I sent an e-mail to Foothill asking if there are any third-party organizations that teach Hebrew that they will give Foothill credit for. But then there is the whole issue with whether UCs would accept that class. I would take the class anyways though.  In my dreams I'm bilingual.

       Yes, it's official. Kelly and I are starting the BWA. Membership is available for those listed below. Those who want to be members can come as guests I suppose. Maybe if we discover your hidden Buffy identity you could join.  As of now, I'm setting up a website. Pictures are first on the agenda. I have a set prepared for those I imagine will join and a few more for kicks. Here is a sample.     If you have a specific picture you want to use of your character, tell me. Jian has already rejected mine, and I'm no offended! So feel free to reject reject reject!

       I don't think I've actually been challenged by a class like this ever before. It's pretty awesome I guess. Usually the hardest thing for me to combat in a class is my laziness.  The entire class except for Brad got C-'s on our last in-class essay, and this week I managed to get a B-! I was actually hoping for something higher obviously, but it's still nice to know I've progressed a whole grade. Brad of course manages to keep his fucking A-'s because I think the teacher has a crush on him.  The nice thing is that a lot of people got C-'s again, and some people actually got an F! So, in a really selfish way, I feel pretty proud of myself. This is Honors English too. Woo!

       I finally found that song! The Hey Jude Soundalike! The one in the End of Evangelion with Giant Angel Lilith/Rei where the world ends! The funny thing, is apparently it's a remix of Komm Susser Tod, that classical song by...I forget who. Now I don't consider myself a classical music master, but it doesn't sound at all like Komm Susser Tod, but whatever.  Anyways, it's called Komm Susser Tod, sometimes Komm Susser Tod - Tumbling Down Mix.  Because I'm a bitch and don't give a crap about online courtesy, I'll give you a link.  urlLink There.  Ironically, that's posted on the webspace of an Energy Research Lab of the University of Mexico. Good times. Now go kill their bandwidth everyone.  Anyways, listening to it without Acid Rei and the wings and the popping heads and the souls and the christmas lights I realize it isn't  that  cool, but I still love it. One thing I didn't notice until now is the woman does have an accent, though it's not as offensive as when most Japanese women try to sing in English. And due to the scene it was written for, it's very long and gets quite repetitive, as it is a seven-minute song. The beginning is the best. Oh, and the woman can't really sing, but that's beside the point. I still love this song ^_^.  So because I'm a geek, I'm trying to decide whether the lyrics are describing Shinji or Rei. I used to say Shinji because of the "..now the gift is all mine", but then I now realize it's "...now the guilt is all mine," so that's more generic and can go both ways I think. Hmm.   EDIT: Okay, it's still obviously Shinji, I'm just crazy. There is no way you can argue around it I think. Oh well, I guess Shinji deserves a song. I mean, Rei has..oh look, Rei got no song! I hate you Anno! Hehe.

       I was going through the archives of websites Claudia has left in dumpsters, and stumbled upon one of my favorite comment exchanges ever. So that it doesn't die, I've decided to  steal  repost the dialogue.   Bun-Bun : Speaking of people you don't like respecting you, I had a length conversation with Ms. Lo this morning.   Portia : That conversation was so funny...you have no idea.   Claudia : What happened?   Kelly : well, i had to ask her about the olympic-sized, underground, fountain-housing, lit swimming pool she wants mounted on a turntable for metamorphosis. this was lengthy because when the conversation started, it was about girl scout cookies, because she was trying to sell me some. then, in her incredibly subtle manner, she intimated that she might like some help with a little project she had planned, which had something to do with a certain fall play. details were not forthcoming, as she did not want to put me off, so i stayed in the theatre from 3 until 8 discussing the feasibility of this project. i expect it will take me about two hours, but i just wanted to be sure. we threw ideas around and by the end, we had this beautiful display worked out where we put jessie ferguson and chris richardson in bathing suits and had them diving into a glass-sided pool from 100-ft. platforms (we'll have to suspend the proscenium a little ways up, we're thinking on four cranes parked in the quad) and then they do a synchronized routine--it's charming--in a tribute to those wonderful water ballet numbers from the golden age of hollywood. portia was there, and she was tickled pink by our lovely idea.   Bun-Bun : Essentially what Kelly said.

       These last two days have been funtastic.  I discovered that I'm one of those drunks who sits in the corner and laughs at everything, but honestly, didn't we all expect that?  Toby wins the award for "One of the most intoxicated people I've ever seen". Be honored Tom. Thomas consumed half a bottle of vodka on top of some cheap wine shit, and then champagne at midnight. Tobias then proceeded to invent the newest verb in the English language, "bedroom". As in, "Camden, go bedroom her!", or, "Kelly wants to be bedroom!" Note, it would appear to be its own plural. He spent the rest of the night trying to sleep with Claudia, followed by some very sexy passing out and vomiting on his shirt and the carpet.   On the surface it may have looked like there was sex going on all the time we were there, through some investigation we discovered that  none  had actually occured. This upset me.  I saw Return of the King finally. Good movie. We all clapped when Orlando Bloom exclaimed, "A diversion!" ...the longest word he ever said.  Eowyn should jump in my pants. Not Miranda Otto, just Eowyn. I still hold that cutting the Shire scene was retarded and retarded at the same time.  So, tomorrow is Hamlet Day. Personally, I'm excited. Kelly and I might spend the night at Jonathan's so we don't have to wake up super early and make our way there on our own power.  Happy New Year everyone. I never thought 2004 would ever actually come.  Oh, and Toby? I grabbed your ass while you were drunk.

       Normally I get depressed when alone, this isn't anything new. But I'm not used to be depressed when I'm around people. I think I'm broken.  Maybe Kelly is right, maybe I'm incredibly paranoid. I thought all these people hated me who don't, so I guess it's the only realistic explanation. I think I just don't know how to handle being accepted. It's a relatively new concept for me after all. It's that cliched you wish for something so hard and then when it happens you don't know how to deal with it. I think I just missed my chance as a kid to learn how to deal with people. My instinct with anything I don't understand is that the person hates me and I hide. It happened again today. Kelly and I ran into Zoe at the Stanford, I got a cold vibe, I assumed she didn't like me. These events happen with me all the freaking time. It's time for me to grow up and, I don't know, not be a big freak show.

       Sadly, I'm not sure I remember exactly how this conversation went. And there was some stuff leading up to this, but it was long  Eric: [Anna Paquin's] career will be limited to Drivers Ed videos. MacKenzie: I'd take Red Asphalt over that video any day! Eric: There's a video I wouldn't mind her starring in.  Yeah, I think I either ruined it or it was funnier at the time.

       Black helicopters are all over the skies of Palo Alto and Foothill College today. Ryan said they were out in full force yesterday as well. Ryan was quick to point out quite astutely that these helicopters must be our country's defense against the commies. They're attacking!  Luckily, I feel a little safer knowing that secret undercover FBI Agent Cat Lockner is monitoring the situation from Foothill College. I can sleep in my bed* in peace.  * or mattress   IMPORTANT UPDATE: I realize now that the commies must be being led by their agent in America, Ralph Nader! He must know about Operation: Green Blood! Our lives are doomed! Everyone locate their nearest bomb shelter!

       Upon hearing that Nader will be running for President again this Fall(see Ryan's comment in my previous post for more information), and after I arose from my fury in which i threw pencils at my door, I realized we must do something. I call you all to arms my friends, we must go engage in *dramatic fanfare here*:   Operation: Green Blood !  I'm well aware that he lacks the endorsement of the Green Party this year and will be running as an Independent, but I think it's catchy.   This operation consists of three vital steps, all of which must be executed with the utmost care. I will now detail them.  1) Find his fucking house. 2) Go to this fucking house. 3) TP his fucking house.  Thank you.

       For those of you out there with iPods, I recommend considering the purchase of the "Belkin TuneCast™ Mobile FM Transmitter", which will "Enhance your iPod™ experience through your home or car stereo."  It works by transmitting the audio wirelessly onto an unused radio station, allowing you to listen to your iPod in the car or at home without big clutter. Clutter is no fun.  It works, the audio quality is good(as long as you don't put too much distance between the transmitter and the iPod), and you can create custom radio stations for your friends who live within within like 10 feet of you. Just think:  Now I can use my iPod as my alarm clock. I can trick people into thinking I found a station that plays The Pillows. You can blast music from your car in a new way!  So, that paper I thought I would get an A on? I got an A. 49 out of 50. Hah. The only reason I didn't get full credit is I didn't list any  positive  changes to the fast food industry in the last 30 years. Well Mr. Hippy, if I had thought you were anything but a crazy liberal who gives off the impression that you want me to think that there were  no  positive changes, I would have gladly gone into them. I thought 6 pages of what you want to hear would be want you want to see. You always throw me surprises. I love you.  Have I mentioned I love him?

       You know that feeling when you've written an in-class essay so well you just know you're going to get an A?  I do now.  And after math class tonight, I'm done with school for the week. Four-day weekend! Party!  I want to have a BWA meeting, but it sounds like Kelly is busy, so unless we receive her consent I would never ever think of going behind her back because frankly she's scary and very capable of killing me in my sleep.

       Programming your number into someone's cellphone is so not hitting on someone. Hitting on someone is asking for THEIR number. If I was hitting on them, I could have at least stolen the cellphone's number!  God, people are weird.

       I am so totally the coolest person alive.  See, I've been rushing out the door earlier and earlier each day because of my consistent tardiness to my first class. Today I felt like I was doing pretty good, but by the time I parked my clock said "10:03", so I was still late. How annoying.  So I rush to the class and open the door, and find a strange female professor and a bunch of asian kids who I don't know.  Then my brain begins to wake up. My car clock was never reset for Daylight Savings Time shit. I got to school an hour early. Where is my brownie?

       You are all in grave danger. There is a serial killer after everyone I know. I don't really know why.  You think I'm crazy, don't you?  Well, today I went to my first class, English, expecting to see my dear friends Brad and Megan. Both of whom, were not there.  After that, I went to Middle East(which I probably should drop...hmm), and discovered my two dear friends in that class, Ryan and Brittny, were not there.  After contemplating the possibility that everyone was throwing me a surprise birthday party six months in advance, I came to the obvious solution that people who know me are getting killed.  Beware.

       I mean, come on! This will be rock music by the way. Rock Sadat!  Act I will consist mostly of his childhood, compressing his time in the big city and prisons and all that into about 30 minutes or so, and ending with the tragic death of Nasser.  Act II will consist of his political reformations, with mostly cheerful singing about the implentation of his political ideas.  Act III will present the main conflict leading up to and ending with his assassination.  I'm crying as I write this. No really. But that's because I'm chopping onions. Which is actually a lie. I'm not chopping onions. Or crying.

       ERIC   m   English, French Pronounced: ER-ik (English), er-EEK (French) From the Old Norse name Eiríkr, derived from ei "ever" and ríkr "ruler". Danish invaders first brought the name to England. A famous bearer was Eiríkr inn Rauda (Eric the Red in English), a 10th-century navigator and explorer who discovered Greenland. This was also the name of kings of Denmark, Sweden and Norway.   ANDREW   m   English, Biblical Pronounced: AN-droo From the Greek name Andreas, which derives from aner "man" (genitive andros "of a man"). In the New Testament the apostle Andrew was the brother of the apostle Simon Peter. According to legend he was crucified on an X-shaped cross, and he is the patron saint of Scotland, Russia, and Greece. This was also the name of kings of Hungary.  Surname Meaning lost to the fucking nazis Pronounced: FUCK-ing AWE-some Potentially means Skinner. (or literally, skin man)  I am the ever ruler of men and skinners, until the Nazis came and took away the Skinner and I just became ruler of men. Of course, the meaning has blurred over the years into have sex with men.

       Can I just say how much better the computers here at Foothill are then the ones at Paly?  This keyboard is really noisy, especially since I'm a "pounder", as someone once said referring to my typing style.  My Buffy arrived yesterday, which is cool. It is going to bother me forever that the 1st season box doesn't match the others. No I mean it, these things really bother me. It bothers my mom too, we had a long discussion about how they should have done it.  My sister is getting into Buffy, and maybe even my mother too. We watched the first three episodes tonight while my mom was making dinner, and occasionally I'd hear her suppress a giggle. "No Mom, it's a nun club."  Everyone in my house is turning into a Buffy addict. Even my cat came to watch.  I drove the minivan for the first time yesterday, and let me just say it was actually a lot of fun. It controls a lot better than my car, which is pretty disturbing when you really think about it.  I really need some love. Anyone find someone good, send them my way.

       There is a new addition to the family.  Saint Cuthbert, Conqueror of the Plastic Tree. We call him Cuthbert or Bert for short.  I bought him today at Petco. He is a hermit crab! Yee! You can see his gorgous mug  urlLink here . Ain't he cute?  Cuthbert lives in  urlLink CuthbertLand . In it you can see his plastic tree, which Cuthbert decided was evil and killed and conquered. I later propped it up again. You can also see the pretty shell I bought for him that he will hopefully change into when he feels like it, and his orange starfish-shaped sponge that he uses to get his water. His food dish is also visible in the back by the shell. Sadly Cuthbert and his accessories are too big for CuthbertLand, so he will be moving into a bigger cage soon. Name still unknown, but CuthbertWorld is a definite possibility.  Cuthbert is the best pet ever. He's silly and hyper, cute and clean, and friendly yet with pinchers to ward off evil young sisters. Cuthbert is a true champion of justice. He also shows an incredibly well-developed interest in  urlLink pop culture , considering his relatively young age.

       I just saw " urlLink Good bye, Lenin! " and am now very much confused as to my overall opinion of it.  It is without a doubt an extremely well-done movie. The cinematography and all that pretentious stuff that only Video Production students and I care about was fantastic, and I look forward to owning this on DVD.  The cast was wonderful. The great thing about an international film is that I go in with no initial opinions of the cast, forcing me to use nothing but my own judgment to form opinions. The lead,  urlLink Daniel Brühl , was an amazing actor, and most importantly an incredibly sexy one. As Toby will attest, I was most impessed by his prettiness. Also pretty was the romantic interest,  urlLink Chulpan Khamatova . The cast was solid, though I had to be offended by how ugly his sister and her boyfriend were. He has ears the size of East Germany. Individually.   Spoilers   My main problem with the movie is pure nitpicking. Alex's refusal to reveal the ruse to his mother before she died seemed purely selfish and only a way for him to escape admitting that he was a liar the whole time. His mother had the courage to tell them of her deceit earlier in life, and came clean with her lie, and all Alex could do was run off and continue the charade. The argument that her health was at stake became irrelavent, as it was revealed that her emotional attachment to the Party wasn't what it seemed. There was no reason for Alex to continue it, and so he just continued his lie. Of course, something the film didn't address was how it could be said Alex killed his mother. Her coma was caused by witnessing his political activism, something he never sees fit to tell his mother, or anyone for that matter. And so instead of taking the blame, he seems to use the West as a scapegoat for his mother's illness. He would rather continue his lie until his mother's death then come clean and admit he is a liar. This saddens me. Luckily, in comes Lara to inform her. Unfortunately for my conscience, the film leaves it very ambiguous how much was told to Christiane. It was enough for her to realize to some extent what her son had done though, and it really depresses me to think what it must have been like for her to face that before her death. The moral is, Alex and I don't clash morally.  Another of my issues is more of a fear than anything else really. While I wouldn't go so far as to say this movie is pro-communism, I do think that if someone wanted to see it that way, they could. And I don't like the idea of this movie being used as Middle College student propaganda, because frankly I don't think that's what this is. Rather than being a simple "Down with capitalism" film, I think it presents a far more complex and historical perspective of the fall of the Socialist Party. And there are certainly huge metaphors in this film too, for someone who wants to go there. (Don't think I haven't, I just don't know  how  pretentious I want to get here)  So, the movie is very good. I've been describing it as a very dark Amelie, and I don't think that's  only  because it's European. See it if you like German. See it if you're interested by the political setting. See it if you're into comedic dramas or dramatic comedies. And definately see it if you have hormones.

       Today is going to be a pretty boring day most likely. Kelly left this morning, and Claudia comes back tomorrow. I don't remember who else is in town because I am tired. Paly people actually have school next week, and they tend to not be very free on Sundays.  I have a slight headache, and my room is a mess. (Note to self: Probably related) I think I will clean my room today and build my new filing cabinet Anton.  But before that, I need to get up. I'm having one of those mornings where everything after waking up seems completely unnecessary. Yes, I'm blogging in bed.

       I finished my essay about 30 minutes ago, leaving me pretty much done for the quarter. I am so relieved.  Now I'm nervous because I'm going to get B's in both of my letter grade classes probably, which makes my GPA already .5 lower than it needs to be to stay in the Honors Institute. I don't think I'm technically a member until next quarter though, which means I just need to get a bunch of A's. Yay.

          When someone says to me, "Ryan," I usually barf. One can cite many reasons for this curious exchange, but only one is actually right because I say so. Ryan is dumb.  Thesis!     Someone once said to me, "Explain Ryan" (Person). I said, "inbreeding." Clearly I am better than him, because I steal witty quotes from Buffy. He does not. Or at least he tries but he cannot beat me because I am geekier than he.    Ryan also is dumb because he is gay. He does not know where my gay froggy hat is. But now he does. So I am cool. Cooler than him you might say. Esteemed Swedish professor Frederick Floofel says his exciting expository  A Brief History of Ryan and His Floofocity , "Ryan is a floofel" (Floofel 3133).    In conclusion, I conclude, that Ryan is ultimately and conclusively, a concluded buttmonkey.  Works Cited  Floofel, Frederick.  A Brief History of Ryan and His Floofocity . Prague    Press.

       As I was driving home from MacKenzie's I checked the clock to see if I was technically breaking the law. It then hit me. As of March 11th, 2004, I've had my license for a year. Woo hoo!

       I've been watching way too much Buffy, because now I'm having prophetic dreams. This morning I woke up dimly remembering a situation in which I was in Japan with someone telling me I no longer care.  And it's true. I thought it just must be a morning fluke, or maybe a day fluke, which I suppose it could still be. But as of right now, I seem to no longer care about Japanese.  Before we all gasp and die, lets review me. Anyone who knows me is aware that I have an extremely obsessive personality. I latch onto a person, TV show, language, job, game, movie, country, celebrity, etc. and immerse myself, often at the cost of money, productivity, morals, and a lot of free time.  This isn't the first time I've woken up and had no interest in something that used to captivate me. Religion, film, theatre, video games, certain crushes, I've been obsessed with everything at one point or another. And I'm taking this extremely well I think, considering this puts me back at square one for "what the hell I want to do with the rest of my life".  So next quarter I will be fulfilling my promise to Shiranne and taking Japanese 3 with her. It will probably be the last Japanese class I take. Clearly I'll be changing my major to something else. I have no clue what. Any suggestions?  And no, I don't think this is just a weird day. I know myself. It's weird, but this is how I work. My life is doomed. I'll never like anything for more than a period of time.

       It's schedule planning time!  I'm taking English 1B, ideally Honors, so since there is only one of those the time  (10-11) is pretty nonnegotiable. However, I will be taking Math 105, and that is totally flexible.  I'm taking Japanese 3 with Shiranne at night, but I don't know anyone who that would work for.  And I need/want to take some PE classes, so if is anyone is willing to do something like hiking, then, yay!

       I would like to start by my describing my night, which was pretty okay. But that would be too normal, so instead:     urlLink     ...in strange and unusual positions! Baaaaaah     urlLink  What's your sexual perversion?      Created by  urlLink ptocheia     Yes. Tonight was good. I think. I'm not really sure. It was filled with awkward moments fo' sho. But it was filled with people, which was different, and some of the people I actually wanted to spend some time around. So that was cool.  I have an amazing ability to not know whether I have a crush on someone or not. I'll be sure on it, and then I'll see them and think I was wrong, and then have a conversation and change my mind again, and then I end up back where I started, which is thinking about sex. But I think I'm good. I got out of the house with some decent results, so I think my ego is slowly being rebuilt.  And he talked to me! Not crush dude, but dude who doesn't speak to me dude. It was certainly interesting.  But when it was just me and crush dude and Leigh and random chick, things went pretty okay. We were talking, and laughing, and having fun. And then my knees started to spasm, which was pretty strange. But I had fun. Which is probably important.  My hands are drunk. I can't explain it, but they have that sort of dull radiant warmth that you get, or at least I get. But I would get this in my cheeks. So I don't know why it's in my hands, especially since I haven't been drinking.  Hands, you are strange.  I'm going to bed now. And tomorrow I'm going to have a bunch of fun with Shiranne,  and everything is going to be awesome. Life is good.

       Don't ever think you're having a good day, because it just makes it hurt all the more when it comes crashing down.  I thought tonight would be different. People were telling me I was cute today, which I suppose isn't that unusual, and its not like I believed them, because I never do. And it certainly isn't that  I'm  starting to have a more positive self-image, because I had a minor internal meltdown today when my sister made fun of my pudgy stomach. But today gave me good vibes. So I decided to go downtown. I made myself all pretty(which apparently means putting on a pair of jeans and playing with my hair for five minutes), and drove to the Stoner Plaza, hoping to see Lauren, who was rumored to be home.  I was wrong. On top of that, I forgot that today is "Everything Makes Eric Incredibly Depressed Today!" So as I walk from Pizza My Heart to Borders back and forth about two times, and I'm about done with the second lap when I realize how much I suck. But because I've been watching Angel, I can't just go and mope at home, I have to brood. So I'm planning to go back to my car and brood in private, but when I get to my car some bloke sees me parking and is ready to take my spot, so I have to move. So I don't really want to go home but I have nowhere to go, so I ended up driving and parking at the top of that new parking garage by Emerson. Here I get out and stand over the edge and watch the world below, which was really kind of boring because the building on the other side of the street really blocked my view. An interesting twist however was when I noticed two people getting it on a few cars over. Afraid they saw my weird brooding, I get in my car and leave when they get out of the car and I realize I know them. To protect their identities, I will call them Bortia and Beric. So I had a hilarious convo with Bortia and then left and went  back  to my first parking spot at the Aquarius.  Again I started randomly (meaning back and forth) walking the streets, eventually deciding to spend some time in Borders instead. So I start looking around, when I see William de Japanese class smooching some blond.  My  William. If I had been sane at the time I wouldn't have reacted at all, probably because I hadn't even thought about him in months. But since it is "Everything Makes Eric Incredibly Depressed Today!", this made me, as you may have already guessed, incredibly depressed.  So I go up to the college books and begin looking at colleges to transfer to, which caused me to find a great number of things to be, as you may have guessed, incredibly depressed. I was however pleasently surprised to see that the "Great Breast of Knowledge", a hack which my father participated in, was briefly mentioned in the MIT writeup of one book. I shortly after realized I was sick in the mind however, when I became depressed upon reading a negative opinion about Palo Alto in the Stanford writeup. I promptly left. Oh, and there was the crazy old man. I really hate crazy people. A lot.  So I leave, and storm back to my car in a, not so stormy way, and to add one more random thing that means nothing but still depresses Eric to the picture, I pass "Padam Pernstein" having way too much fun with some people I didn't even recognize. He's still hot.  My life sucks. I'll never have a social life, let alone a boyfriend. I've given up trying and I'm going to die an old gross bachelor when I'm 26.  How are you all doing?

       In my dream last night I received a call from a cop. It said Carryer on the caller ID, so I knew it was from Portia's house. It went like this:  [Female] Cop: Do you know Quentin? Me: I'm sorry? Cop: Are you aquainted with Portia Carryer? Me: Yes. Cop: She and two straight males were arrested on a murder charge. I need someone to ID them within 8 days or else they walk. Me: I see..does it have to be now? I was about to go get food. (I had a date with Brittany Heideman) Cop: I understand. I'm tired, you're hungry. We'll do this another time. Me: Can I have your number? Cop: *laughs, then is silent for a while, with background chatter* Cop: *to someone in background* I thought it was a cops prerrogotive to work alone. *people laugh in background*  I don't really remember what happened after that, but everyone stay away from Portia. She's a criminal.  *NOTE: Throughout the day yesterday I kept remembering little amusing things that I forgot to put in here. Namely, the specification that it was two  straight  men and the wonderful line about being tired and hungry. Plus, I failed to specify that the cop was female.

       At about 2:00, about 10 minutes after I came home from school, I received a phone call from my sister at El Carmelo asking for Tylenol. I happily obliged, and ziploced the proper dosage and started my long walk there. (2 minutes tops)  She instructed me to go to her classroom, but as I went by the fence I noticed a dark forboding sign that said, slightly paraphrased, "Anyone who dares to bring Tylenol to their sister without going to the main office first will be castrated".  Caring quite a bit about my gonads, I began a hunt to find the main office, which was conveniently in the first place I looked. It was also in the last place I looked as well.  In the very petite office, I spotted Friendly Neighbor Bridget (FNB for short) behind a desk which, by its name plate, belonged to a woman named Barbara. I informed FNB of my mission, and she told me I was a dumb dumb man. In other words, she looked at me with fear and said, "Are you 18?" Clearly this is age discrimination, but because of the F in FNB I had no fear. I asked what could be done and she said that maybe she was on Sarah's emergency contact list, which she was, which would seem to end the mission.  On the way out however, I was spotted by El Carmelo Elementary School Principal Lupe Garcia, formerly Jordan Middle School Principal Lupe Garcia, who, by some bizarre cruel luck, remembered me. He engaged in me in a painfully long conversation about me for approxamitley 15 minutes to a day. Then of course since I can't be rude, I had to ask how he was, which almost lead into a long talk where I would have had to pretend to care about someone who was a very distant part of my life for a mere year.  I then proceeded to walk home and write this. My life is so thrilling.

       Apparently I'm intimidated by extremely flamboyant gay people. Does someone want to explain this to me, because I'm drawing a blank.

        Note: Last names changed to respect the privacy of..me   If you see this I order you to leave this site now. We all know how much you suck at keeping secrets from me, and I ask that your respect my privacy or else I will sneak into your bedroom at night and take your dolls' heads off..  That's right. My sister possibly found my blog. Apparently she was searching for "Kelleman" this morning, and some sites still have this site with my old e-mail address in their archive, so until then I'm still quite visible. My dad discouraged her from entering it, but who knows whether she'll snoop around later.  It made me realize how much I want her to be able to see this. I want to have a sibling I can be really close to. But a 9-year age difference obviously poses issues, and this site is hardly appropriate for a 3rd grader. I can only imagine how fun it must be for people like Jonathan and Kelly and people who get to have their siblings read their blogs and such. I don't know if I'll ever be able to be close to my sister. We're just too far apart in age. When she's 20, I'll be 29. She'll be entering maturity at a time when I am literally maturing. Not to mention my family doesn't have the greatest history of close sibling relationships.  Maybe thats why I don't feel like I love my sister sometimes. (Okay, a lot of the time) Our relationship is just not one I can understand. I feel more like a third parent to her than anything else, something that drives me insane and causes me to do dumb things that get me yelled at.  I do have respect for her. A lot, actually. I'm possibly the only one who really understands how hard life can be for her, I mean, genetically I have more in common with her than anyone else. And I know how hard it can be being in this family. And she's handling it a lot better than I did. She's having trouble in school too, but she's still trying, she's not going to give up. She has many more friends than I did at hr age, so I'm not worried about her clamming like me. Seriously not an issue with her. She's incredibly smart, as hard as it is for me to accept that. I've always had a hard time dealing with people younger than me just because I require a certain level of intelligence to interact with people without going insane. This makes it hard for me sometimes with her, but when I meet her friends I realize how lucky I am. She may be the brightest and most successful person in the family, I firmly believe. Fitting, as she is the last Kelleman of this generation.  She shares my interest in a lot of things, which is something I really don't appreciate enough. Not only is it not just her trying to be like me (which is what it was when she was younger), she goes out of her way to do things with me sometimes even though she knows she won't enjoy it I think. She's too nice to me. I treat her like crap. I don't know how else to treat her. She gets on my nerves so easily, which isn't fair to her. She has genuine psychological attachment issues (to me, and much more so my mother), and I of all people can't respect that, which is pretty low of me. But it leads into my fault, which is an inability to adapt to various social situations.   She's very cute, and I hope and believe she'll be very beautiful when she grows up. I sometimes dream of the day when she's married with children, and I look forward to being there, if she lets me. I sometimes have guilt that I have no intention of carrying on the family line (I have the name, and I do have family pride, I just mask it under disgusting levels of modesty), and I want to be there for her and her family when the day comes. Maybe we can be one of those families that lives near each other, and can see each other from time to time. Believe it or not, that's not too common in this family. My closest direct relatives live in Chicago, and we don't talk to them.  Hmm...sorry for this random tangenting that is this whole post, but I think I finally understand how I want to be a family. I want us to be close. I want to avoid all the fall-outs that seem to be inevitable in this family. I would never say this in front of my parents (especiallly not my mother), but I have incredible respect for my Grannie F, who still to this day tries to repair her family. My mother is right, Grannie was probably a large factor in what caused it all to break (what with her OCDish perfectionism? NO WAY!), but she hasn't given up. What can I say? Stubbornness is very much a family trait.  That must be why Grannie has trouble with the in-laws. My mother is perfectly content living in a dysfunctional family; she did it her whole life, and barely cried the day her own mother passed away. It seems so easy to see that keeping those old traditional family values is archaic and too much unnecessary hard work, but I think everyone in this family (Hey, everyone period. Everyone has got some black sheep in the family, right?) knows how much we need each other. We may drive each other crazy, but we all know on some level that it's because we're reflecting our own faults. Better for us to stick together and drive each other crazy than to split and be alone. People in general are meant to be in a family, but we are especially I suppose. We have things that bring us together (and in turn apart), things about us that only we can understand. And most importantly, we do have pride for the family. We care when someone accomplishes something. We look out for one another, and we don't criticize other peoples lives because we dislike them, but because we honestly think they can do better.  Warning:Dumb Pseudo-bragging  We're very smart people. We can accomplish a lot. My aunt's a film professor, my dad's a high-ranking engineer of computer science. My grandpa chairheaded a project to renovate the specifics of some NASA rocket thing I know little to nothing about. My grandma was the first woman in the family to graduate from college, and on the flipside my uncle is very successful without ever having graduated from college. My 2nd cousin is a marine photographer, who apparently is well-known enough that my last name was recognized by a guide on a whale watch. That was mainly just weird though.  And we have to put up with a lot. Doing work isn't easy for us. All three siblings of my dad's family had intense difficulties in college. My uncle never finished, my father was almost kicked out, and my aunt switched schools several times. My great-grandfather commited suicide when my grandfather was only 13, the first of many he would see throughout his life.   We understand each other. I like to think so at least. To other people we appear lazy, or just plain challenged. Maybe we are, in a weird way. But we don't think so. It's an awfully big relief to know that your family has faith in you. I know so many people who don't get trust from their family, and that's the one thing I get in spades. We may drive each other up the wall, but there is something going on there that's just unsaid.  So my family needs each other. And I know none of my parents' generation will do it. And my Grammie is still trying, but she won't succeed. But I want to be the one who tries. It could be difficult, to say the least. While I get along quite well with my uncle's children, they live so far away that we hardly know each other anymore, and aren't that close. My aunt's children on the other hand, I haven't seen in at least five years. Actually, I haven't even met the "newest" one (She's three I think). So it's not going to be easy for me to get up in 20 years and try to form a bond with people I've never even really spoken to. But I pledge to do it. Because more than anything else, I believe this family will apart in a second without someone holding it together. And I want to hold it as long as I can.  Because I'm a pussy who needs support from others. If any of you read all that, I apologize. It was mostly for me I think. Writing on here makes me start thinking about things I really should think about more often.

       We have many computers in this house. My mom and I each have our own, and my dad has his laptop in addition to one in the family room which he usses most of the time at home. My sister also uses this one. There is lastly my old PC in my room which is currently being used by nobody.  The one in the family room is very old. Everything runs veeery slowly on it. This shouldn't be a hard issue.  Take the old PC in my room!   Of course, my dad decides instead to buy a new computer, without telling anyone. This kind of annoys me. I know he's the income of this family (though not the sole income anymore), but I feel like this is just a ridiculous waste of money and I'm not pleased with what he did.  Still, it's a very nice computer. It came free with a flat screen monitor (which are officially teh secks), and it plays Final Fantasy XI very nicel ^_^.

But it's not like this anger is coming from nowhere. Maybe the medication is irrelavent, maybe I'm venting. I'm taking  something  out of everyone, I just don't know what. Just...give me time to sort this all out. I promise I'll get better.

       Hey everyone! Remember all the fun that was had that winter two years ago. The one where shit hit multiple fans? Well gee golly, I think it's happening again! Isn't this just nifty.  I'm going to stay neutral this time. I swear it. If anyone catches me being partial in anyway, please tell me, because I really don't want to be. I just don't want to go there. I'll make it worse, we all know that. I'm sorry, but I can't. If you talking to me is going to try and change this, please just don't. Shitty stuff hurts so much more when you're foolishly involved in them.  I met a Japanese Jew today. She's in my Honors Astronomy class. She's a sweetie. We were talking about languages, religion, and astronomy. All rather predicatable topics, but I don't really have anything else to say here.

       I'm home. I had incredible amounts of fun. Kelly is the most pimping person ever, and MacKenzie is my hero.  To protect the innocent (and me), I will not be doing a boring transcript of the weekend. I will however mention a few highlights:  a) My handwriting while drunk is identical to my normal handwriting. And we're not talking about being a wee bit tipsy. This guy told me that he fell in love with his best friend but was still straight. This seemed extremely important to me, so I went to great lengths to fetch paper and pencil to write this down. I woke up with this paper in my pocket followed by a very brief but appropriate silence.  b) The gang's drink of choice was Smirnoff mixed with Whiskey and lime. Highly recommended. However, be careful when making your second one. You may put in way too much whiskey the second time, making it extremely strong, making you go over to the couch and have conversations with strangers about gayness that I then proceed to write about on paper.  c) People from Long Beach are not allowed to do Rocky. Ever. The most obvious reason is that there  is no fucking dance for "Hot Patootie!"  They also just are missing a lot of great lines. The only good one I heard them do that was new to me was "Cause I've seen  Brad's cock , through the tears  Where did he cum?  in my eyes.  d) The entire LA area is cursed. I've never been there and not gotten lost at least once. This was no exception. It's the Hellmouth at work.  e) I got to see my penis size rule at work. "Are you Jewish?" "No." "There you go. Don't feel bad about it."  For full details about this weekend, (And believe me, you want them) call me or talk to me or something. Or *cough* Kelly *cough*.

       I am in Kelly's driveway, about to begin our exciting roadtrip to Claremont to see MacKenzie. I'll be back on Sunday.  By the way, I'm online because someone in the area was nice enough to provide a wireless internet connection that wasn't password protected. Possibly Kelly's family, possibly someone else. Oh well.   Today many things happened. Ryan's jaw is rotting. My dad blew the lighting for my entire wing of the house, and my mom poured antifreeze into my car's coolant tank.  Kelly is at the door, so she's probably about to leave, so I better wrap this up. This whole wireless in the driveway is cool, and if I don't blog while there, I'll talk to you guys later.

       Fraknoi, of San Francisco, is an award-winning science educator and a scientist who is nationally known for his skill in interpreting astronomical discoveries and ideas in everyday language. Radio and television audiences have enjoyed his sense of humor and clear explanations on many local and national programs for more than 25 years.   As chairman of the Astronomy Program at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, he teaches popular courses on introductory astronomy and "physics for poets." More than 900 students enroll in his courses each year. Fraknoi has given more than 400 public lectures on such topics as: Is There Worthwhile Real Estate (and Are There Real Estate Agents) on Other Worlds?, What Were the Atoms in Your Body Doing 8 Billion Years Ago & Why Should You Care? and Why Falling into a Black Hole is a Once-in-a-Lifetime Experience.   For 14 years, Fraknoi served as the executive director of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, an international scientific and educational organization founded in 1889. He was also editor of its popular magazine, Mercury, and its newsletter for teachers, The Universe in the Classroom. During this time, he organized more than a dozen national workshops to help teachers in grades 3-12 do a better job in teaching astronomical ideas. He also founded Project ASTRO, a program that brings professional and amateur astronomers into 4th-9th grade classrooms. Project ASTRO is now active in 13 regional sites around the U.S. A new branch of the project, called Family ASTRO, on which he worked during his sabbatical in 2001, is developing kits and events to help families enjoy hands-on astronomy activities.   A prolific author, Fraknoi has edited two collections of science articles and science fiction stories for Bantam Books, and is the lead author of Voyages through the Universe (1997, 2000, Harcourt Brace), which has become one of the leading introductory astronomy textbooks in the world. He is also editor of a two-volume teaching guide called The Universe at Your Fingertips-one of the most widely used astronomy education resources in North America.   Radio listeners know Fraknoi as a frequent guest on local and national news and talk programs. In Northern California, he appeared regularly for more than 20 years on the Jim Eason Show on KGO and KSFO. Recently, he has again become a regular on the Pete Wilson Show on KGO. In the last seven years he has been one of the most regular guests on the Forum program with Michael Krasny on KQED, and is the "astronomer-in-residence" on the syndicated Mark & Brian Show in Los Angeles. Nationally, he has been heard regularly on Science Friday, Weekend All Things Considered, and Sounds Like Science on National Public Radio. His television appearances include The Today Show, CBS Morning News, Larry King Live and The Pat Sajak Show. During the 1980s, he was co-author of a weekly newspaper column on astronomy, which was syndicated by Chronicle Features, and appeared in newspapers in the U.S. and Canada.   Fraknoi serves on the board of trustees of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, a scientific and educational organization involved in identifying possible radio signals from civilizations around other stars. He is also a Fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), specializing in debunking astrology. Recently, he was re-appointed to the prestigious American Astronomical Society Education Board.   Educated at Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, he has taught astronomy and physics at San Francisco State University, City College of San Francisco, Cañada College, and several campuses of the University of California Extension Division.In 1994, Fraknoi received the Annenberg Foundation Prize of the American Astronomical Society, the highest honor in the field of astronomy education, as well as the Klumpke-Roberts Prize of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific which is given for a lifetime of contributions to popularizing astronomy.   Asteroid 4859 has been named Asteroid Fraknoi by the International Astronomical Union to honor his work in sharing the excitement of modern astronomy with students, teachers, and the public.

       Spring Quarter began today. I will now talk.  Math was craptastic. Eleanor de Blake is in the class, and we decided our teacher looks strangely like an evil goat. Professor Carr seems to steadfastly believe in the often quoted but rarely true statement of "For every hour, prepare to spend two hours working outside of class". So she is nice enough to provide us with two hours of homework every night. Isn't that sweet? She also spent five minutes being overly sympathetic for us having to take high school math in college. It was kind of bordering on just plain rude. These five minutes also culminated in her amazingly helpful education on using our "I wills" versus our "IQs'. Isn't that just dainty?  Astronomy on the other hand is the most awesome class ever. It's the first class I've taken in a lecture hall, so it's everything I imagined college to be and more. Professor Fraknoi is a lovable and silly Hungarian man who I would never have guessed that English is not the first language for. Picture Jonathan's dad, but Hungarian. He also talks endlessly about how no prior math or science skill is assumed in the course, and instead focuses on "sexy topics" (Which is, thankfully for all of our funny bones, a term he uses frequently) He finished today's class with a series of slides which were really gorgeous, and when it was time to go, for possibly the first time in my life I wished for a minute that class was longer.   On Mondays, such as today, I then walk the very long trip to across the hall into a classroom where we have an honors seminar in astronomy. This basically means sitting around talking about astronomy. The only work for the class is one 3-5 page paper, which is good. I already have a topic in mind. I'm going to talk about Linguistics and Astronomy, as in how astronomy terms have entered casual conversation and slang. Stellar or astronomical, for instance.  Monday and Wednesday nights I have Japanese. I've discovered that ますだ先生 never really taught me anything, as half the terms they reviewed on the first night I didn't know. Considering that it's Japanese 3 and I've taken  more  than two years of Japanese, that should say something. My teacher is adorable, and there are two adorable student aides.  It's Pesach. My mom bought a whole bunch of leavened products today forgetting this. So I gorged before class. And I mean gorged. And god was the gorging good.

That one had people e-mailing me condolences and getting outright angry with me. I had one worked out for today that involved me talking about how I was really straight and I was just a late bloomer, but it would have been retarded in actual writing I realize. So, no pranks for me today. Sniff sniff.

You know what this all means?  All this new stuff makes me want to *dum dum dum* do spring cleaning! Of my blog that is. I plan to do a few things.  1) Delete posts that are just broken links and/or quiz results. If other posts are seriously devoid of any content, they go too.  2) Add titles to all the old posts. Titles were added sometime in 2003 I believe, so a lot of the early entries don't have them, and they are teh ugly.  3) Because this would be boring otherwise, I'm going to add in fun little italicized commentary on old posts! Yaay! >_  In other news, Dream Elisheva made Dream Bun-Bun smoke, and he suffered the wrath of instant karma.  UPDATE: Complete through the end of 2002.

I've disabled anonymous commenting, because there really is no need for it. If you want to comment on my site, and you don't have a Blogger account already, sign up for one for free in like 5 seconds. You don't need to make a blog, just an account. The profile feature here provides a nice mini-network of sorts that Blogger didn't previously have. It's not LiveJournal, but it's not meant to be.  Woo! So once more, all previous comments have been wiped. Have fun with that!

       Which should be all of you. Matthew Broderick has been added to the cast list of the upcoming movie version of Strangers With Candy. Umm, yay?

       So, I just found out  now  that hiking was apparently a letter grade class, and not pass/fail, like I previously though, which means I have another A on my transcript. This doesn't really affect my GPA in any significant way, but I thought it was cool.  So bored. I really feel like people are avoiding hanging out with me, except for one or two people who aren't here. So, yeah. I'm clearly the most unfortunate person ever.  I'm so incredibly over Bret, but my subconscious won't let it die! fheuhfawqj99u39rf. Yes. I go days and weeks and months without even thinking about him, but he is still in my dreams doing random things without my permission! He was a waiter at a restaurant in Tibet last night. I think he was a Fed. He's probably stalking me through my dreams. Well, in my dreams, I'm the wizard master.  And this other guy who I had a brief interest in a few months ago IMed me today to ask me something which he seemed to really care about my answer to. This was awkward because what ultimately made me lose interest in this guy, aside from his horribly appalling taste in friends, was the way he would seem to show no interest me. This was the first time  ever  that he IMed me, as opposed to me starting to bug him and he just typing generic boring badly grammatized responses. So then I didn't see him for like what, months? and here he was trying to keep up a conversation. It was awkward. But in a disconnected and unimportant way.  *barf*

       I'm done with Spring Quarter, and with it, my sort-of first year of college. I'm hungry.  I totally flunked my math final, but it's okay. I calculated ahead of time that I couldn't get an A in the class, and to get a C in the class I would have had to get less than 80% on the final. I got 83%. I thanked the heavens and took them out for dinner.  Really really hoping I did super good on Japanese final. *crosses many people's fingers*  So tonight I was abducted and taken to my sister's CMT show. What could have been a gross, boring and painful experience, was quickly made better by my examination of the program. I quickly spotted a "Vallone" in the show, and then another one on the next page. Quickly scanning the audience, I immediately found Tony seven rows in front of me. I only could have recognized him because of his brown striped shirt. It was funny.  It's Summer. Where is all the fun?

       Wouldn't it be funny if we actually went to see  urlLink this ?  Except I'd be bored out of my mind, it'd be a waste of money, and he would justifiably be extremely creeped out if he saw me there probably. But still, other than those minor details, wouldn't it be hilarious?

       Grr. I'm sitting here not allowed to leave the room because she has this insanely gross detachment issue with my mom who, you know, works. How dare she. Working. Doesn't she know that a mother's role is in the home pampering the stupid daughter with baked goods?  So here I am, babysitting her even though we have a paid babysitter sitting not three feet away from me. So yeah. We're stuck watching my sister be in this dumb "Rock Musical". It's about rocks. Get it? Get it? Ohh.  I hate watching kids in musicals. It's painful. I have guilt about ever being in one and making my parents feel like they ever had to go to one.  I need to go to school. But she's not letting me leave until her friend shows up at an unspecified time in the next like 20 minutes. Even if she has no real power keeping me here, I know if I leave this babysitter will have so much shit to deal with, so her retarded begging works on me.  No one over the age of 5 should start screaming and crying every time my mother has to go somewhere.

       Please comment on my blog site, not the feed on LJ. While the RSS is fantabulous, the comments don't get mailed or otherwise informed to me in any way, so the only way I see them is if I randomly go check. This pisses me off.  So the solution is to comment on my main blog. Thank you.

       I'm not going to be caught without something to do this summer. Hell no.  I've packed myself in hopefully. I'm taking Music of Multicultural America and Law and Society online. The former is taught by Barkley, who is supposed to be pretty damn cool. The other one was picked because it is the only other class that sounded vaguely interesting that doesn't have too much work. I'm not in the mood to be writing papers this summer.  So yeah, two hopefully not hard classes that will be easy A's. 8 units worth at that. Sexy.  I'm going to New York for a week at the end of July. Then I'm free for most of August. Not full. Damn damn damn. Maybe I'll try and get a job somewhere for just August.  I'm turning 18 on August 26th! Very shortly after that, it's looking promising for me to actually go to Israel finally! Woot! I return from that sometime in September, I kill the rest of that time, and then Fall Quarter starts on the 20 somethingth.  Other things that need to be accomplished: a) Barbeque b) Beach party c) Hot tub party

       Who am I kidding? I'm such a liar. I do it for no reason. I am a pathological liar. By definition. I'm sorry guys. I've probably lied to you at some point or another.  Just thinking, sometimes I can't tell the lies from the truth myself anymore. I thought maybe by covering up a few things I could be a person people could like, but no one could even love the fake me.  I don't know who I am, because the lies seem so real. I'll be telling stories and one will come out that I always tell people and I don't even remember until afterwards that I'm a lie.  I think maybe everyone should stop talking to me. It would teach me a lesson.  I create these nice little scenarios that just sound so good that I get wrapped up in them and forget the small factor that they're not true.  Like that last post. I don't even know what just happened. I was trying to be candid, but it just turned into me bullshitting or something and I don't even know why! Am I trying to sell some image of me being some little fucked up youth?  I mean, a lot of it is true, but come on. Like I love myself? I fucking hate myself. But not in a way that interferes with my life, so I just accept it. Whatever.  I don't understand identity. I never could. As long as I can remember I would often just sit and contemplate what it means to be a specific person. Do you ever look in the mirror and wonder why you look back at you? I was obsessive. I still am.  I hate who I am. I can't stand me. I'm not attractive. I'm really not. And the worst is that I go around acting like I think I am, and I know just how annoying that can be to people. I despise people who go around looking like they think they're gorgeous when they're so incredibly ugly. But I'm so insecure about my insecurity that I overplay everything because I can't hear the truth, no matter what it is.  I mean, I don't give a crap about the truth anymore. I just want to hear pretty things.  I don't understand why people like me. They say I'm funny or cute or stuff that I don't even know if it's true, but aside from all that surface stuff, what about me? Why would people like this boring shallow person? I don't really have much to offer anyone. I'm way too obsessed with people's perception of me to give a crap about other people.  And now I'm crying. Hah. It's been a while. Notice how I can only cry when it's about me?  Don't give me sympathy. I really don't deserve it.  Just stop talking to me and maybe someday I'll be able to act like a person.

       I'm depressed for no reason. Well, no good reason. It's because I'm me and I do stupid things and then can't admit it and then I'm mean(er) to people.  And then I become overapologetic and I blame myself for things that maybe actually aren't my fault, but I'm so guilty I just do it to myself anyways.  They really are my opinions, I just shape them into an attack. What, am I trying to prove something? What's the point of going to such extreme lengths for something so retarded, especially since I'm probably wrong as always.  Everyone is trying to grow up too fast, and I'm left trying to remain immature. Soon hanging out with me will just be babysitting.  I'm not ready to let go of it all, even though I never had a grip. It's like I've never lived.  I'm such an uncaring fuck. And the worst part is that I don't care. Or something. I guess I do because it maybe bothers me, but I don't know that it really does. I enjoy hurting people, but I don't like having people be hurt.  No one can help me, because I'm too stubborn to admit I have problems. Even now I'm convinced that this is just a fluke writing and everything will be fine in the morning.  And it will be. That's the worst. Things always seem better in the mornings. How can anything be that important if by the morning I never care, no matter what it is?  No matter how many life-changing experiences I have, I never change.  Becoming aware of my problems just makes me bitch and whine more, it never makes me want to be different.  I think I'm scared that I don't know how to be anyone else.  But I'm not very good at being myself either.  Why am I so insecure? Why can't this be like real psychology where everything has a reason for it being there? Have I always been so insecure? I always was shy. I guess that's sort of the same. And then it changed into something weirder in high school. I gained confidence, but not security. Like that makes sense. I was able to love myself, but I still was obsessed with how other people viewed me. Hah, past tense. Because it's sooo gone.  It's like, even though my entire life is based around trying to get people to like me, even if I fail I know I'll still love myself. But I'll be miserable.  This is way too therapeutic.

       So I'm a happy camper. Though I am not camping. I just finished my big astronomy paper, which was the only thing stopping me from feeling like I'm done with school. Granted, I'm  not , but that's a minor detail.  So I'm done, taking a five minute break before I dive into another funfilled hour or two of work.  Today I did nothing but work. This may not seem unusual, but this is me. I woke up at 12, and worked essentially nonstop on my paper for 10 hours. And I feel strangely non-exhausted and ready to move on to my math homework, followed by an unspecified amount of time studying for my kanji quiz.  I think I'm broken. In a good way. Like, since when was I まじめ？  Whatever.

       -The all-class picture isn't in the amphitheatre! Ahh! I mean, duh, but it's still crazy to see. -Some people have much worse pictures than you would expect them to. Like, wow.

His hair is the shit. -I have the best Senior Write-up ever. Like, seriously. -In "Who's your Idol", someone wrote "The french freshmen". This may or may not be intentionally plural, but the more important issue is: Is Shmark pimpin it? -Simon spelled Booya wrong. Fucker. -John Kamikihara has the best quote ever in his write-up. I'm such a loser I have to write it here. "Mom: You were always there to yell at me both at school and at home. I won't forget all the embarrassing moments and all the stupid fobbish things you've said." -Gabe is insane. Anyone know what the hell his write-up means?

The quote for it reads "We're learning about technology that will help us in the future."

Fuzzies! -Brittny Norah got a whole page. -Haha! Gabe is tiny! -Kai was the cutest little kid.

       Yesterday I went shopping at Old Navy with Shiranne, and part one of the new me is coming along quite nicely. I've got to say he looks a lot like the old me, but a little bit sleeker.  I'm going to New York for a week on the 13th, and I'm going to Israel with Shiranne August 12 through the 24th, just in time for my 18th birthday on the 26th.   Saying I just finished cleaning my room would be an understatement. I just finished a weekends worth of cleaning, reorganizing, and decorating. I emptied, sorted, and trashed boxes and boxes that had been sitting in my closet, and it is now wonderful looking. I cleaned off my desk so I have working space, and I made it pretty and clean. I have my computer, printer, magic 8-ball, and several pictures on it now, which makes me feel special and adultish. I finally got around to putting my prom picture in Shiranne's frame, which is nice.  My shelves have all been reorganized, and some changes have been made. Nothing too exciting. A few new items on the wall. Random pictures of people I found in boxes, including HIGG! Yes, HIGG is now on my wall. And it's the hot picture I thought lost. I have the card declaring my おたんじょうびおめdてとう points, and a baseball card of my sister up. My closet door now has a sign politely warning people of the great white shark living inside it. My TV area has been tidied very appropriately, and it now takes up a minimum of space. Very shiny.  So while going through my stuff, I found a pack of old Red Sox trading cards. I have no idea how old they are, but judging from the players, I'm thinking pretty. It's pretty cool. I kind of wish Ryan was home so I had someone to show them to.  Ryan and MJ are now on my desk. As is the classic Elizabeth in the Frog Hat picture. Good times.  As a reward for doing this, I bought myself Firefly. It's pretty much the shit.  I think my iPod is broken. This may have something to do with me losing it in a pile of crap on my desk for like at least a month.

       My best friend in 2nd grade once told me something that made me become the man I am today. One Belgian afternoon, he pointed out a girl sitting on a bench writing in a diary. He said to me, "You can tell she's smart because she writes a lot."  Now, the context of that situation may be hazy, but what isn't is my recent realization that are geniuses among us. One might expect to find them deep in research institutes and making large amounts of money in jobs that benefit mankind, but I was lucky enough to discover one in the large cesspool that is Amazon.com. His name is stevethemoviefan.  While looking at some DVD on this site, I noticed a link off to the side leading to the "Listmania" of stevethemoviefan's entitled "The New Classic Series". Now, one of the awe-inspiring features of a "Listmania", is that the author is required to have some sort of title following their name, showcasing their expertise in that field. Naturally, the best of these are the genuine ones that really show you that this person is an expert and knows the world. stevethemoviefan's title was "High School Student". I clicked.  Steve's list opened a world I'd never dreamed of. He recommended movies to me I would never have considered seeing. There are many films that are true gems, that for whatever reason, don't get enough publicity and thus never become big enough for people like me to appreciate. Thank god for Steve for making me aware of such sleeper hits as "Kill Bill", "Pirates of the Caribbean", "Terminator", and "The Matrix." How does someone like him know how to find all these hidden gems? He must be a genius.  Of course, knowing which of these films to see first could pose a rather nasty situation, so good old stevethemoviefan is kind enough to provide a detailed summary of each film, and his thoughts on the movie. I'm going to give you a few of his comments, which are provided right beneath each entry.   The Matrix:    stevethemoviefan's comments: THE MATRIX    Terminator:   stevethemoviefan's comments: TERMINATOR   Yeah. Like I said. Pretty much a genius. I wandered from here into his about page, where I was treated to a shock. Most people maybe make about one listmania, realize it sucks, and never makes one again. Not stevethemoviefan. Steve is smart enough to realize that his lists are the most useful thing on Amazon as of yet, and has kindly given us, not two, not three, but 35 of them. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. 35 FUCKING LISTMANIAS! Only someone with no life, or someone who is an incredible genius would have 35 listmanias. I don't think I need to say which stevethemoviefan is.  Naturally, I can't even begin to cite the wonders of each and every listmania he has blessed us with, so instead I will end this post by telling you some of his best, in hopes that sometime you will go and read them in your ample free time.   Best of stevethemoviefan:   My DVD Collection (Part I) My DVD Collection (Part II) My DVD Collection (Part III) My DVD Collection (Part IV) My DVD Collection (Part V) My DVD Collection (Part VI My DVD Collection (Part VII)  So yes. Not only does my good pal stevethemoviefan know roman numerals, the sign of an intellectual, but he also has an insane number of DVDs. He must be rich off of his lists.   Movies I've Seen in Theaters (2003) Part 1 Movies I've Seen in Theaters (2003) Part 2  Personally, I found these lists an exciting glimpse into the mysterious and surely wonderful personal life stevethemoviefan.   My Favorite Movies of 2003 (No Order... Yet)  My Top 25 films of 2003  My Favorite Movies of 2004  My Sister and I Favorite Movies   My Favorite Movies  My Favorite Movies of All-Time   Why so many lists seemingly about the same thing? The great stevethemoviefan works in mysterious ways.   Movies of 2004 (Part 1)  Movies of 2004 (Part 2)  Movies of 2004 (Part 3)  Movies of 2004 (Part 4)   Can I just say how long I have been looking for a list of all the movies released in 2004? This is a dream.   The Brady Bunch Movie Collection  Robots will be in our future   Like I said. Mysterious ways.

       Tonight Jian and I had an adventure at Borders with my new camera. I hope you enjoy our spoils of war. Jian was quite a sport in agreeing to be my model, putting up with some heavy humiliation in front of others. Let's all give her a hand.  But first, business. I leave for Israel on Thursday, and I get back the 24th (two days before my birthday  >_  And now, the pictures:  Jian's innocent eyes were subject to horrors she had never seen before. Poor her.    What naughty mischief is Jian up to now? Unfortunately, this cameraman could not follow.    Jian shows that even she can look beautiful while reading the most mundane.    Jian threw a bit of a temper tantrum when she saw this. Apparently this toy is just what this kind of girl wants. Take note, men.    Jian spent some time trying to delve into the heart and soul of her favorite book. Unfortunately, she's a bit directionally impaired.    Jian was exceedingly fond of "The Snowman", and decided to show her affection.    Jian spent some time resting with her favorite poet, and contemplating some of his more intellectually heavy work.    All this hard work had made Jian work up a roaring appetite.    BONUS! BONUS! BONUS!  Check out this uberrad  urlLink video  showcasing a glimpse into the personal life of the beautiful Jian!
