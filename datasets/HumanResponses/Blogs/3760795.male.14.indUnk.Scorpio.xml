      If you came here on your quest for Kazaa Lite, well i can't really help you. I was given this domain by a friend (thanks) and i just re-directed it here.  The app is actually illegal so i can't host it directly. Sites that hosted the app have received ceist and decist orders to stop hosting it. There are a few options:   #1     - Look for  urlLink Kazaa Lite 2.4.3  here.    #2     - Become a mac convert (comme moi) and download some decent p2p software. I recommend  urlLink Acquisition .   Comment with any questions... and say thank-you...

      Had a strange journey out of school today. The journey from the school to the friend's house (well, flat really) takes about ten minutes but i still had to endure two  urlLink tropical rainstorms  with barely any let-up in between.  God is indeed a keen student of geography, the rain had been timed perfectly so that the second i left the school it started and raining, and within seconds of me entering his house - it stopped. In fact, it was like that the whole day: it had only rained during breaks between lesson blocks. And it's summer.  I managed to annoy a  urlLink "Hampstead mother"  on that way home. In case you don't know, a Hampstead mother is the unemployed-live-off-my-husband's-huge-salary-type. They can occasionally be found participating in feel-good  urlLink volunteering work  ("i've always wanted to give something back to that poor community (cough, shithole, cough) that i never had to live in") or indulging in new age shit like  urlLink Yoga  or  urlLink Pilates . When they aren't in a  urlLink Starbucks , they can be found in a  urlLink spinning class.      Well, that's quite a thorough description of your average Hampstead mother. They are also quite irritable, as i discovered earlier. I was making my way back home from his house at about seven, and on the way to  urlLink Swiss Cottage  tube station i had to cross that twelve lane one-way road. It's the one in the piccy above, with the fifteen traffic lights. And so i did, and managed to drop the entire contents of my open bag halfway across. I couldn't just watch all my work fly away and it took absolute  ages  to pick it all up. Everyone waiting in the cars were suprisingly patient. Except the Hampstead mother. Presumably my right of way had clashed with the first few minutes of  urlLink  Richard and Judy  , causing immense pain to this complete idiot, alone in her  urlLink fuel-guzzling SUV.  She beeped and beeped and beeped for nearly 20 seconds whilst i picked up the remnants of a Geography project and then proceeded to nearly run me over.   In total i was there for nearly a minute on what seemed to be London's busiest street, and blocked up a major one-way. A major achievement in an otherwise boring-as-hell day.

      I'm showing my geeky side by posting this - reserve your judgement. For some reason, the  urlLink Apple  homepage is set as my homepage on  urlLink Safari . So here are a few first impressions on the upcoming operating system:  urlLink Tiger .     urlLink iChat AV  : The new version will be able to video-confrence with 10 people at once. That's pretty bloody impressive and completely useful. It's going to be pretty awesome when it comes out.     urlLink Spotlight  : This is basically an Apple native version of  urlLink Lauchbar , and is in effect a complete copy. I've been using LaunchBar for a while and can state it's incredible usefulness though.     urlLink Dashboard  : This is just one complete ripoff of  urlLink Konfabulator  and has got everyone annoyed. It's not essential to the operating system but Apple still chose to include this rip-off, the makers of Konfabulator are clearly annoyed.     urlLink Safari RSS   : This will be interesting, building something as usefull as RSS into the browser. Current alternatives are excellent - like  urlLink NetNewsWire      urlLink VoiceOver   : A spoken interface for the OS. I'm not completely qualified to say this, but doesn't this already  sort of  exist?  Some good features, but mostly just little tweaks and gimmicks and some complete rip-offs. It cannot carry the flag of being a major OS release, unlike previous releases like Jaguar and possibly Panther.

      Damnit, my ankle hurts, no it  really  hurts.  There i am, minding my own business on the Jubille line. The train is packed (thankyou,  urlLink industrial action.  It was one of last trains before the actual strike began, and so was obviously packed.  The train contained the usual suspects. Firstly, the woman talking on her phone so loudly that she renders it useless. She actually sounded a whole lot like  urlLink Nadia , one of the future "celebrities" on this years  urlLink  Big Brother  . Don't worry about it, i don't watch it (that much.)  Then you have the second type, the one that reads either  urlLink The Sun  - or an oversized  urlLink broadsheet.  How they dress tends to determine which one they read... (snobbish - it's been noted)  And finally there was the annoying beggar-person, the type that traverses from carriage to carriage clutching a baby and trying to look sorry for themselves.   Either way, almost every passenger can be grouped into one of these three. Anyway, enough incessant rambling. Back to my ankle.  Well theres not much to tell, i walked onto a  urlLink green grape  and slid backwards inside the train. It's hardly a dramatic novel.

      There's going to be a strike on the  urlLink Underground  for the rest of today till 6:30 tommorow (24 hrs) , due to  urlLink industrial action . Read the  urlLink overly-biased LU side of the story  if you want.  For those who can be bothered, the  urlLink BBC  has come up with a guide to  urlLink alternative transport  (like the unthinkable - walking).

         urlLink  Westminster Council   has become the second council to take  strong action  against record companies that flypost. You know what i mean, those year-old ads advertising some  urlLink "50 cent"  album, stuck to a phone exchange box.  Following the strategy put forward by  urlLink Camden Council , they are suing none-other than the "record company bosses" and "entertainment company chiefs."  Obviously by targeting them they mean sending them "commitment to good behaviour" cards.  Yes, apparently nothing makes a record company exec drag his head out of a massive pile of coke, stop being serviced by whatever  urlLink boy / urlLink girl  he's promised pop stardom to, and sit up and take notice like a strongly worded card.  Have a look at the  urlLink "bling"  site... it's local governments attempt to get  urlLink "street cred."  Pfft..

         And i  wasn't  there, which mildly annoyed me - having to see it on  urlLink tv  and all. It was on last night on  BBC THREE  and Muse where headlining, they were on at about midnight. Damn i wish i was there, some friends are going to the  urlLink V festival  (i think...) - the strokes, pixies and muse and all the rest are performing. Naturally, i don't have tickets. Chances are high that  someone  will drop out and i can buy their tickets.

      There is, perhaps, one guarantee in life, that is that you will die. There is also one fairly safe bet, that it will be painful - and freedom and property are illusions that can only exist in the mind. It is only when you realise this that you have true freedom - especially in this weird increasingly  1984  world  Meh - i don't feel well.

       Love at First Sight:  The overwhelming desire to see the inside of the nearest closet (pub toilet, friend's back garden, the alleyway over there et al.).   True Love:  Can be introduced to the family without unreasonable fear of embarrassment. On the part of the family.   Everlasting Love:  A polyamorous couple who haven't had sex with each other in years.   Love Match:  An alliance between kingdoms.   The Love of Your Life:  The indolent boy from your last year at Uni who spent 8+ hours a day online and ate all the Nutella, the memory of whom somehow improves with time.   In Love:  A momentary instance of being almost as interested in someone else as in oneself.   Motherly Love:  Capable of untold amounts of suffocation.    Brotherly Love:  Forbidden by the moral laws of most world religions.   Lover:  The one who comes round when your partner's 'out of town on business' (read: seeing his lover).   Lovable:  Cuddly. In the pejorative sense (similar to the concept of 'shapely legs,' which is code for chubby).   Lovely:  Only just bearable. "That was a lovely party! I do hope you take me to Kettering again!"  ********************  Yes, i know . I should be working in geography right now - another worthless project. In other words the teachers can't be bothered to teach and we can't be bothered to work. Fine by me - it's a project on the past of that lovely seaside town,  urlLink Walton on the Naze , and its past present and future. Funfunfun.

      Alas, i have school tomorrow. Lucky  urlLink american  kids have been on break for ages, and i have to wait till  tuesday .  Woke up really early this morning - 8:45, which is early for a Sunday. I must see a  urlLink doctor  about my chronic  urlLink insomnia  recently, i can't sleep till about 2 and when i do i can only sleep till like 5:30 and then i wake up and can't fall back to sleep. It's seriously started to affect me, i walk into school at mornings like something thats just been hit by a  18-wheeler . Anyhoo enough ranting, the million dollar question: how was  urlLink  Shrek 2  ?  That's a hard question to answer; it's just an animation so you can't take it too seriously. Sometimes it just felt like it was trying to hard to appeal to multiple ages, which meant it felt too much like one of those films that are  "fun for all the family" , which i hate. It was quite funny though, too clean - but then you have to remember: this is a  urlLink PG  animated film. You really  can't  take it too seriously.  I've lost my beloved - my  urlLink  cam-phone   that is. I had to giveaway the stunning t610 to my sister because it's the only phone in this house that works with antiquated American  urlLink cell-phone standards . I've been a photo-virgin for the past two weeks whilst she wastes her time in boring  urlLink Florida . This of course means no photos from today till i can get this damn disposable camera processed.  Ali's wee-little birthday part-aaaay (yes, that was sarcasm) was today. It wasn't a part-ay (or even a party, too be strictly speaking), just a fun get-together involving  urlLink Pizza Express  (i took margherita and fanta - my usual) Shrek 2 and the "N1" centre which -shock horror- is on  urlLink Upper Street  in N1 in london. So if you were one of the people who had to endure 90 minutes of us brats in the  urlLink cinema  i sincereley apologize for our behaviour... yeah.  Been  urlLink homeshopping  all weekend. Home shopping as in looking for a house/flat to buy/rent, not looking at a tv screen and buying  urlLink crap  (see: "George Foreman's lean mean fat reducing grilling machine"). It seems my parents are sick of Willesden (they're trying to look all middle-classy - it doesn't work) and are looking into  urlLink NW3 ,  urlLink NW8, NW1  and N1 (near Ali). Those are generally the most expensive places in this godforsaken city (Hampstead, St Johns Wood, West Central and Islington for those who dont know what i'm talking about - i didn't before the wonders of daytime telly brought us all these "sell your house" programs) and are way competitive - as in (for example), £850,000 plus £35,000 ground rent.   Which is a lot - even if it is a  "5 bedroom massive Georgian townhouse in the heart of Hampstead Village" . Snobbish, i know.

        I wasn't going to rant about it, but now i've started i will end. The pictures show some pictures i nicked off of some  urlLink bbc news  article about that terrible "pop concert" which i had to endure for ages. Well, not actually ages - really only a few minutes - it's not like i actually went. But still it sucked. That's what prompted me to get a  urlLink blog .    Just getting ready to get the hell outta here to see  urlLink Shrek 2 ... All the teachers are going project-crazy now that its end of the term and they can't be bothered to set any real work. Which means i have 3 projects due in, one Music, one Spanish and one Chemistry. I'm doing some presentation on the chemical contents and additives in  urlLink "http://www.skittles.com" . Basically i have to come up with some trash that scares people into not eating Skittles (apart from the fact they taste gross) - like saying that an additive is known to cause cancer or whatever.  Okay, now i'm in a serious rush. I'll post some piccys from later today.

      The Lilian Baylis School in Kennington has become the first school in the country to ban slang speech in lessons. In case anybody remembers, this is the same school that Shadow home secretary  urlLink Oliver Letwin  said he would  urlLink "rather beg than send his children there" .  As the  urlLink BBC made a big deal of , head teacher Gary Phillips feels "pupils need to be proficient in both spoken and written English to pass exams."  If a pupil does use a slang word in class,  "the teacher corrects it on the board and gives the standard English phrase. They then put a tick next to the slang each time it is repeated to show how often students slip into the habit."   The best bit: Student Nicholas Harris told BBC London about his experience of the scheme. He said:  "It is hard because the people I hang around with always use slang. So when I have to speak standard English I really have to focus."

      Does  urlLink Sony  still feel the need to label all it's audio players "Walkman". The title, synonymous with it's  urlLink first cassette player , is both outdated and sexist. Instead, if the company is to defeat sexism in it's R+D ranks, the product shall be named the   Walkperson  ...  But seriously, is this device actually any use. It has followed in a long line of Sony deviced with proprietary media, the list also contains many failures (think  urlLink MiniDisc  and  urlLink Betamax ). The product, as everybody knows, is technologically superior (think  urlLink Apple Macintosh ). Unfortunately as the product is based on proprietary standards it fails.  To be specific I'm talking about .mp3 files. Who the hell has an audio collection that isn't at least 90% .mp3? Sure, mp3 files are the method of choice for us  urlLink "music thieves" , but it is also Sony's key market. They cannot expect everyone to use their  Connect  music store (or any music store) as much as Apple expects punters to use it's  urlLink iTMS .  Sony has yet to make it clear if listeners will even be able convert their .mp3 libraries to the Sony compression standard - now that would suck. By putting a device to market that can supposedly offer better battery charge-life, more music and at a lower price, it has opened up one market - but closed another market. The .mp3 music thieving pirates, who will always make up the majority of the market.

       My first post - I'll start with some tech news     urlLink Sony  is to revamp its infamous Walkman by launching a digital music player to rival Apple's  urlLink iPod , which has led the market since its 2001 launch.       Sony said its 20-gigabyte device would be about £55 cheaper than the top iPod model, which has a capacity of 40 gigabytes.   It is also aiming to boost use of its online music store,  urlLink Sony Connect , as its Walkman will play songs only in the company's own format.   The new Walkman hits Japan on 10 July, the US in August and Europe by September.   Sony said its Network Walkman NW-HD1 would sell for less than $400 (£219) in the US. This compares with $499 (£274) for the highest capacity iPod.   Sony says its device can hold 13,000 songs while Apple boasts the iPod can store 10,000 songs. But the two firms use different recording technologies which make like for like comparisons difficult.   The Sony device will be incompatible with other online stores and cannot play tunes in the popular MP3 format.    Small in size    It is slightly larger than a credit card and less than half an inch thick. Sony said the battery lasted 30 hours, at least three times longer than the iPod.     Sony hopes to rival Apple's hugely successful iPod. It also promised shock-resistant technology that protected the hard drive if dropped.   Launched to mark the 25th anniversary of the original  urlLink Walkman cassette player , Sony said it had used advanced compression technology to pack more songs in a smaller storage space.   It uses a 20-gigabyte hard-drive, compared with Apple's highest capacity 40 gigabyte models.   Sony said the NW-HD1 would be the smallest player of its capacity on the market.   Sony has sold 340 million Walkmans during the past 25 years, including several million CD players.   Source:  urlLink BBC

      It's been a while since  urlLink Belle de Jour , the anonymous prostitute and  new media  celebrity, has been featured in the broadsheets. That was until appearing in the  urlLink Guardian's 100 most powerful people in media  list, billed as  "the definitive guide to the most powerful movers and shakers in one of the UK's most vibrant industries".   BdJ made it into the top 10 of the new media section of the list, coming in at number 10. Apparently the BdJ is "representative of the millions of online bloggers and the year that blogging went overground", and not just a ludicrous addition to an otherwise sensible list, designed to get people talking about it.  The second bit of BdJ news this week is the addition of her much-anticipated book to an  urlLink Amazon page .  The book, titled "Belle De Jour: Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl", is not "a salacious catalogue of sexual encounters," but is actually an "unfolding story of her life: the difficulties in juggling her very understanding boyfriend with her profession; the question of what to wear to work; the problems associated with managing pubic topiary and the often hilarious hypocrisies she bears witness to every day."   urlLink Amazon  are selling the book for £10, but we're assuming that price goes up if you want the book to do anything 'kinky'.
