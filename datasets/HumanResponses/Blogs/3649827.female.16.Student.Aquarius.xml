         i really like this movie. someone...yeah..heh a certain someone once said they heard it was a modern day catcher in the rye. i'm going to read that book soon. i miss having that someone around to keep my mind amused. pathetic as it was.  i guess we can't always have what we want. as smarterchild would say.      is it just me or does it look like he's wearing a harry potter scarve in this?? but i do believe igby came around first. oh my! harry is a copy cat!

      two in one day...what's the matter with me? well what can i say? i'm off my high.   Mood:  back to whatever it was before.  Music:  Talking Shit About A Pretty Sunset - Modest Mouse   and i claim i'm not excited with my life anymore so i blame this town this job these friends, the truth is it's myself.   how's that for setting the mood? i'm ready for home. and i feel alone. there's this weird alienation feel that i get most of the time here. i miss the utopian blissfulness of the weekend. and i'm now back here to horrid labs and indian accents. they(the ppl) are all nice. though i don't know if they genuinely like me. i never know if any one genuinely likes me...whatever.  and i never know if they understand me. sometimes i'll do anything just to talk. about nothing if necessary. at least it would be something to do. and when i do talk i don't know if they understand half the stuff i say. they just look at me and smile and nod there heads. and laugh if i say something that sounds remotely funny. what can i do? i feel so trapped here. but i don't know how much better home would be.  i would feel trapped there to. and feel far way from everything and everyone. and all that bother's me will build up inside, until i can't hold it in any longer. and i will succumb to it and be defeated.  and if i ask myself what is truely bothering me. i could probably give the answer. it's a petty matter. but it just sets off everything else. i wonder if there's anything else left for me to do...i hope it rains tongiht. i hope it's dark. i hope it saddens the hearts of those undeservant. while it cheers mine.  if nothing else, at least the weather will relate to me.  i'm losing this mood too...my thought process is shutting off. i blame the uneventfulness of my surroundings.

         mood:  has been given a much needed lift  music:  none! b.c well duh! you know what i'm gonna get me some in just a minute....ok now that's better ahem music : modest mouse.  ok wow. i got my first paycheck. and if certainly does make me feel wonderful. one fucking thousand dollars. i thought i was gonna cry. it's so pretty. wow. and here i was going to come and talk about all the things that have been overwhelming me lately. but with that check in my hand...i feel as if maybe everything will be ok. who said money doesn't bring happiness? it's making me plenty happy. *sigh* i take that back *satisfied contented sigh* i've been going driving with driver's ed for the past two days. nerve wrecking. but i'm living. he took us out on the interstate today. and i didn't get us all killed and that is very exciting indeed! and i asked him around what grade my driving is and he said 90-95. which is awesome! and my GPA isn't in jeopardy!!! holy shit how come all this good is happening on a tuesday? has the curse of the tuesdays been lifted? wait does that mean there's a new day? oh great. now i have to look out for the new cursed day. between you and me i think it might be thursday ... oh shit i hope not! curiosa is on a thursday! but that's another thing giving my grief. it's so hard to plan for it. who all is going, how we are getting there. and we haven't even purchased tickets yet, but we can't do that until i get confirmation of who all is going and which kind of tickets we are getting. i wish i had gotten it as early as possible but now it looks like we will be somewhere in the middle. and i wont' even be able to see their faces. it makes me sad. and rides! there's too many if's and but's to think about and honestly i don't really want to think about it at all. but i feel as though things will work out ok. and school work. holy shit. thats gonna be awful. and the work stuff. but i won't stress about it right now. i have to go to lunch. so yeah.

      ahh the end of another week. and i am glad. why? do i really have to explain? man its friday and i have nothing to do. not that it's that unusual. but for a while it seemed to be doing differently. i got off work early today. that was wonderful. i spoke to max for a really long time yesterday. at least i think it was yesterday. he's really nice. he said i was 'like a teddy bear'. haha...i'm not sure completely how to take it. guess what i'm doing? if you can't guess by the title. you are quite incompetent. nothing really very interesting is happening right now. *thinks* nope not at all. i meet the most....unique ppl at work. like this one guy...in his car..he listens to the same song on repeat over and over again for a month. and this other guy, he's obsesssed with becoming a vegetarian, but he's not one yet. and he says 'man' at the end of every sentence. i'm still bitter about wasting my entire summer at this shitty thing they labeled a job. at least the ppl are nice. (to my face) did i mention i'm a paraniod freak? oh shit..the mood and music thing. dammit. forget it.  there is barely anyone on the internet. ben's on. i'm talking to him...i guess everyone else has something to do. and ben has no gas....any ways. i hope there's something to do this weekend. i wish i could get out of my house. and just drive. i don't necessarily care where. just away. drive around aimlessly. why can't my parents leave the car out??? maybe by tomorrow i will be able to take it out whenever. tee hee tee hee. still illegal..but...not as long as i don't get caught. and maybe soon enough..it won't be illegal anymore ack i can't think of nething to say. i'm sorry i'm not very interesting at the moment. that makes me sad.

      hey i'm gonna remember doing this thing this time :  Music:  NONE!!! but:  Music in my head:  Saves the Day and Modest Mouse  Mood:  tired as crap and yeah...bleh....just bleh  i'm at work as usual. i'll be so glad when this is over. i did something really stupid with some graphs i had to make. it kind of made me feel incompetant. i don't know why that would bother me. it's not like i care about this that much. i felt really bad yesterday. lena's husband asked me if i like working here. i said yes. i don't know if he could tell i was lying through my teeth. yesterday was nice. some ppl came over and we watched The Last Samurai. it was a good movie, though really very sad. thomas was there. and nadia happened to mention "omg we just hung out with thomas." i know that sounds weird. but thomas and i haven't really been as close since highschool started. but it was nice getting to hang out with him. and it didn't feel weird at all. i miss the days when we used to be close. but i guess these kinds of things happpen. even though you don't want them to. and i take it way better than i ever thought i would. back in eigth grade i couldn't imagine not being best buds with thomas. but now...i mean...call it adaptation. and it happened without notice. i wish me and eddie hung out more. i saw  him for the first time yesterday. i don't know if  he feels it, but i feel like we've drifted apart also. this was almost a recent thing yet not. i think i can trace it back to almost the beginning of the second semester. but i don't know. maybe everything will be alright. i hate it though. feeling like i'm not close to ppl anymore. there's so much that i feel that i haven't told him, regardless of how minor they are. and it feels like we don't know each other. but we do. maybe i'm just the weird one. it's not like things have been happening to me. yet they have. and we don't talk. at least as much as we used to. there are more ppl with whom this happens also. like andy. i mean sure we are still friends. but no where close to like how we used to be. did we stop understanding each other? i mean is it just the course we were bound to take? it's not like i'm heart broken or anything. it's just...regretable. now do i sound cold-hearted? that's not what i mean. i guess i'm saying there's not much that can be done about it. i wouldn't know how to try. and i'm too scared of being disappointed. i figure i can "go with the flow". have i ever mentioned how much i hate that expression sometimes? yet it's all that i seem to be doing. and i guess that it's ok. i cannot alter the course things have taken. i can do my best to adapt. let's try talking about happier things. hmm...well i tried to be mad at my parents for not letting me go play spotlight at wright's mill. but that didn't work out. we never stay mad at each other for very long. i don't think any of us have the ability to. but i guess it's ok, b/c i got to see ppl yesterday. and nadia spent the night. she hasn't done that in a long while. and monday there were ppl at jordan's house watching a movie - Vanilla Sky - i've seen it before. but i like it ok.  i can't remember this weekend. oh wait yes i can. it was father's day weekend. it was actually a good weekend i thought. :) especially saturday. haha. i'm so awful. i can't recall the week before that....i think i did stuff. i just don't remember what. wait! tom's house was friday....ek i give up. my memory's gotten so awful. maybe i should write more. about stuff i did. just for the sake of being able to remember stuff. i'm not usually this kind of forgetful. i think i went to chrissy's to see a movie. and maybe jordan's sometime to do something. or maybe not. sheesh. anyways moving on before my brain bursts. i finally renewed lord of the rings. i didn't get as much time to read as i would like. i think i lost my summer work stuff again. where does it keeping disappearing off to??????? i think we might go pick up our new car either tomorrow or saturday. that's exciting. but i still don't have my license. i'm going to be driving for driver's ed next week, and i'll probably take my test then to. let's hope tasnia passes. i'm getting kind of lonely. i would like someone to talk to. but this computer blocks out aim b/c the stupid machine is....stupid...i can go downstairs...but then those computers block out every other goddamn thing. *sigh* -_-; i think i should go read. it's getting to the pretty interesting parts. and then when i'm done i will have a marathon of lord of the rings movie day or something. b.c i am just that much of a dork. i decided to wear to work what i wore to bed.(well...plus jeans...) but i feel very comfortable now. some ppl (como dad) doesn't understand these kinds of things. or why anyone would want to go swimming in the rain. or just run around in a thunderstorm. thunderstorms are awesome man. the weather is so beautiful today. i hope it storms. that would be lovely. i rememnber this one time we were driving on the highway and it was the intro to bad weather. it had such an ominous feel to it. i loved it. it suits my mood.

      curiosa is one thing i look forward to. i hope all goes well. if not...well fuck. that's not cool. i think i'm tired. i don't want to be tired right now. i don't really know what i could want. i want to sneak out. but i can't. the car isn't out. i wonder if this sneaking out deal will still appeal to me when the car is officially mine, and i can drive legally. sure i guess. but for what would i go? maybe the question should be who. but there never is really a who. i went to see someone once. on a whim, that was fun. but that's not exactly what i'm talking about.  do i want a dec-jan deal. yeah well duh . ok maybe but change a few things about it. otherwise though. i really liked it. it was exciting. fascinating. things were... nice. almost chaotic. but you know i had the false hope everything would be fine. it doesn't matter now. and don't get me wrong. it doesn't effect me like you think. it effects me the way all things effect me. i feel insufficient. can't explain it.  oh fuck. i forgot again   mood:  contemplative. tired. usual. yet not.  music:  hmm... the tv is on...it's the newlyweds. eh.  great. now i've lost whatever mood i was in. Interpol is pretty moody, isn't it? but it suits me. it was raining like hell today. it was nice. storms are awesome.  and of course what did i think about driving through it? you got it. i'm so pathetic. i need it. i need something. i need more than one thing i think. what has this got to? and i don't think it's bad at all. i need a good fix.  a fix. haha. make of it what you will.

      yeah...i am 'working' away.  just got back from this seminar.  this dude from some college from NY came by to talk about some thing i don't necessarily care about...yeah. can't wait to get home. i am dog tired. i meant to get some sleep last night. didn't work out as well as i would have hoped. just for the record, the title is a lyric from a song. (just so we don't have any confusion) oh yeah i meant to do this at the beginning :  mood:  blah  music:  none...really...Ambiance of the lab? i can tell you what's stuck in my head though....well obviously it's the Lit song. and then the cure, and for a while jewel.....yeah. it goes a little something like this:  i can't remember what was said or what you threw at me, please tell me, please tell me why.... i brush my teeth i put the cap back on, i know you hate it but i leave the light on. i read the paper it was more bad news, more hearts being broken more ppl being used. put on my pjs and i hop into bed, i'm half alive but i feel mostly dead.  i try to tell myself it'll be alright. i really shouldn't think anymore tonight. cause.. i want to love you more...ooo ooo ooo  anyways. today i didn't have to go the processing lab, which is fine and dandy with me, it is so fucking hot in the big suit thingy. grr. and the work is so tedious. but what i had to do today was even more tedious if that is possible. i had to sit and grind 'specimen' (otherwise known as fucking pieces of plastic) into their proper sizes.  yeah. that's right. we're talking millimeter precision. -_-; did you know there is a tasnia.com? and all it says on there is welcome to tasnia.com. kind of queer. haha. i wonder who did that.  wouldn't it be sad if it were me? and i just didn't remember? wait. don't you have to pay for an address like that? i  sure didn't pay for any of that kind of shit. is cursing allowed on this site...? well...it should be...if it's all about expression and such. i think i had other things to say, but at present i can't recall any of it. it's hot as a motherfucker. i'm glad i wore sunscreen. haha. now i won't get cancer! yay! but seriously, i don't burn. i just get tanner and darker and darker...i remind myself of a caramel sundae. *thinks about what she just wrote* uh...hell..what is the point in taking it back? i've already said it. my stupidity just seems to increase with age. i swear i was sharper when i was younger. should we list all the stupid things tasnia has done so far in her life? no we shouldn't...it would take to long...  and stupid is often synonymous with embarrassing. so yeah-no.  i guess you learn...kind of. and get experienced. let's just say tasnia this, i guess, past year has become, uh... somewhat... more experienced. *sigh* does stupid also go with illegal...yes...sometimes. nothing major gosh. it's not like i'm a drug dealer. more like sneaking out and stealing the padres car...just things i didn't i'd do. but i am. and enjoying the hell out of it. it's neccessity. what can i say? i think that's enough for now.

      i'm not exactly sure what this is supposed to be...but yeah...here it is. what do ppl usually talk about on this? i have no idea. did i mention i'm not entirely sure why i'm here?  haha. anyways...today...was dull. work sucks, as i have said so many times before. BUT i am making money.  and that's the only reason i'm there. working in the lab is tedious.  i hate it. i really do despise work. but i guess i shouldn't be complaining. i know a lot of ppl who want work..and don't have it.  but this is just a summer deal. but i wish i wasn't wasting it. i don't like having nothing to do. makes things feel worthless.

        Music in my head:  it's way too late.......to be this locked inside ourselves...the trouble is......that you're in love with someone else......it should be me. oh, it should be me.    ok, i started this post at 1:54 PM July 28th, 2004....but yeah i never exactly finished....let alone get started...though i've tried, it's been what? about 2-3 days now? and amazingly enough i've got the same song stuck in my head so i figured i'd go on....         yeah the same exact song is stuck in my head except now it's a different part:   oh, how i love you, in the evening, when we are sleeping...      well curiosa has come and gone, and all the drama of the past few days has subsided....i promised ashley that i would write all about curiosa in my blog...but i think i'll just tell her about it...for some reason i'm not totally in the mood to talk about it at the moment. i'm sure jordan probably wrote about it in her blog...and our accounts will most likely be similiar, save one small detail, ahem *coughfakerobertsmithcough*   what i do feel like saying is that i've been strangely emotional lately. it's so unlike me. not that i'm like a cold person or nething. it's just that recently little things will set me off.   i mean there was a period not even that long ago that i couldn't cry when someone i knew died.   and now it's like my daddy yelled at me *bawl*   what the fuck? we've gone through worse. i don't know what made this nething special. it was hard on him too....   and it was the stupidest thing today...i'm watching princess diaries ( i movie i'm not a fan of but i noticed the guy in it was kind of attractive sooo ) and at the end of the movie there's that staged little kissing scene, and i felt like crying my eyes out and throwing something at the TV saying "i want to be in love!!!!" *pouts and crosses her arms*   heh.   and again, it's not like i haven't been bitter before. but i don't recall the last time i was that strongly affected by it. afterall this is an ongoing fucking thing. and i thought i was handling it all so well. i don't know. maybe it will pass soon. i hope so. i don't like being this way.   i remember when it was all weird and i couldn't cry when things happened to me, though i really wanted to .... but then if i watched a movie i would...especially armaggedon...oh what that movie does to me... gheeawd.   aaaannnndddd now i'm home along. because i refused to attend this pointless gathering with my father and that sibling of mine.   and i don't know what to do.   i'd call someone, but who? i don't know if i've got nething to say. it's that awful mood.    grr.   hmm...i'm sure there's some law and order marathon on....i could busy myself with it perhaps.   hah. i don't even feel like doing that.    SEE!   i told you. it's weird.    but everything's supposed to be fine.    i even said that...not but a week ago.   i'm such a strange mofo.   but i guess i will leave now.

       weeelll...it is the 32nd post.     Music in my head:  we ain't going to the town....we're going to the city...     &nbsp;  this may be very quick. i haven't decided yet. but it's only been about a day since my last post. and not all that much happened. not all that much i feel like talking about.   uh. hmm.. yes. good things happen. example: WE JUST GOT OUR NEW CAR. and it is very pretty. and i like it very much. mogwai was the very first song to be played in the car...yeeshh. they should feel special.   so i got off super early for that occasion. we had to be there when the ppl came to drop off the car. they were awfully nice. i guess they had to be.    then i had all that time to do whatever i wanted. and i did none of my summerwork. i'm disappointed in myself.   then nadia came over for a while and that was good fun.   and then blinkie and zach came over.    and then nadia came back to pick me up so i could go spend the night at her house and that was swell. we stayed up until 2:30am talking. and i liked it much though it didn't give me that much sleep. heh.   nadia is most wonderful.   curiosa is in 2 days.   heh. wow. stupendous.    &nbsp;

         Mood:  waiting for reality to stab me in the back     Music: MOGWAI! YAY!       &nbsp;   this past weekend was really&nbsp; very good.&nbsp; the only thing that could have possibly made it better is if nadia and blinkie had been able to spend the night last night. but that is all well, b/c we can do it sometime later. welll let's see...friday i went over to jizzy's for una pelicula (ack! i remember spanish!) and then i spent the night at her house and that was all well. yay for porn night! haha. man those things are stupid. but so darn funny.      and then, when we all woke up, (me being the first at like 10 and jordan and anne at like  1 pm.   .... i had to find various methods of amusement....so i played with jordan's stuffed animals...anyways on with the list of stuff i did:)&nbsp; we started playing uno. nasty brutal uno. haha. the first game like lasted almost 2 hours. haha. and then we ate. and played uno some more. oh oh, and we played disney trivia while watching disney movies. yess. and and then we went back to my house and watched a bootleg copy of sherk 2. haha. AND THEN BLINKIE CAME OVER. and she brought me   THE BRAND NEW INTERPOL CD THAT ISN'T EVEN OUT YET.   because she is just that awesome. and she also let me borrow the virgin suicides. which is a wonderful book. so i'm trying to read like 3 books at the same time. oh yes and i felt pretty productive b/c i read 1/4 of catcher in the rye (and wrote an entry for the first fourth), and i did a wee bit of history. i wish i had done some more. but oh well. that's what today is for! hmm...bad sides were well...my parents weren't too happy with me staying out so much (which is absurd in my opinion) but all of sunday i stayed home. yeesh.&nbsp; and there is even more good news to be related. but i don't want say nething until i see it right in front of me.       AND curiosa is only 4 days away. and that is enough for anyone to be madly happy.     or at least&nbsp;me.     i've only been at work for about 46 minutes, but i'm ready to go home. haha.     normal ppl would be quite happy at my state and not question it, but I of course, go into a fit of paranoia. why? b/c i'm absolutely stupid and think that in turn for all this good something bad has to happen. no, not like karma. but my own little thing i've got designed in my head.      ack. it's better not to think about it like that. i'll let it go. and enjoy stable contentedness.     yes.

       i've got a deoderant stain on my shirt.   i hate those.   i didn't make it to zach's afterall, just like i thought. and that bums me out. but i'll live. yeah.   what did i do instead? history. hah. well at least i was productive.   elizabeth left her catcher in the rye copy at my door step, b/c I FUCKING DIDN'T GET HOME UNTIL SEVEN!!! and so now i've got that and i'm gonna read it. and it's going to be good.   i've only read a page into in and i like it already. heh.   i'm listening to interpol yet again. i can't stay away. oh but i did for a while there. i listened to the mogwai cd's the wonderful blinkie burned for me. and they are wonderful.   i love the titles they have for their songs. they are neato.   i don't know if i really have nething to say..   oh my effing god   you remember that dude that works here and listens to the same song over and over (his name is moni)...(not mosi, that's a diff guy..) ? anyway the guy with the songs...yeah he and this other dude had an accident at the processing lab yesterday. and the other guy got out ok, like just some burns and such, but poor moni got his face all burned up and had something stuck in his eye, and they couldn't get it out for like 6 hours!!!! that's really scary.   i mean i've never worked with the thing they were working with but now i'm pretty hesitant about going to that lab though. i'm only here another week sooooo YAY!!!!!   HOLY MOTHERFUCKING SHIT!   curiosa is less than a week away!!! how awesome is that?!?!?!   it's gonna be great.   i can't wait.    so is that damned presentation. but i will wing it. and everything will be ok.    yeesh.   i'm not in the best mood. i don't really know why. nothing's wrong right now. i don't think. i feel like i haven't seen my friends in a while. but it's only been like 2-3 days...   maybe thats not it.   what else? my dad and the car thing bums me out.   it's like he builds me up and gets me all excited about getting a car and then lets me down. like yesterday he had already signed all the papers and wrote a check and all this crap, and then he talked to the guy and he didn't have something that my dad thought he was getting and he had to cancel it. i know it bummed him out too. and then the other car he thought he should have gotten.   and then that time when we went to atlanta and looked at the cars there, and we should have just got one right there and then, but my parents wanted to look around and shit. i don't know.   i keep saying that i don't care what kind of car they get.   but in the back of my mind i know i do. cause i have my heart set on one of two.   and i would be thoroughly disappointed if it wasn't one of them.   unless it made my parents happier to get something else...i don't know. i don't know what i mean by that. i sound so contradictory. i want this car, and i have my heart set on it, but i'll be ok if they get something else. well the brat side of me wouldn't. but my logical side would.    and i go with my logical side most of the time. even though my brat side fights it.&nbsp; a lot.   well i don't think there is nething else to relate in my dull life. *sigh*   i need excitment.   i can't wait for curiosa.    i have to dress up for the presentation. hmm. and then come home and change and GO TO ATLANTA. tee hee tee hee. woo hoo!    it's about lunch time again. and my stomach bids me to go...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

(did i mention i finally named the pets...well there they are...) my tummy is grumbly. grumbly in my tumbly. and i don't know where my advisor person is. but i must be fed and i'm stuck here until she gets here. yesterday all the non graduate student ppl had lunch with the chairman/vice president guy.  and everything he said was completely contradictory to what the other dude said. mahfuz is all "be formal" and "memorize these equations" and shit. and jeelani is like "your report can be on 5 new words you learned" wtf? these ppl drive me crazy man. though yesterday's lunch was&nbsp;a bit reassuring. he also said that no one would be asking me any questions. but&nbsp;i fear dr. mahfuz. he's a tricky one. and it's really weird considering he's been a friend of the family forever and all. and he's such a tiny man. who would ever be afraid of me. but at the same time i'm scared to like make him mad.&nbsp; -_-; *indian accent* what to do? oh great. those guys are rubbing off on me. yes my sad existence here also means that i am stuck with only biswas and jeelani jr to keep me company. yea yea there are the graduates and all, but....haha yeah.&nbsp; and there's that mosi kid too. but he's not here half the time. now where are those ppl? i am hungry... oh yes. and zach's having a thing at his house today. and i really want to go. but the chances of my making it seem slim. the thing starts at 5, i might not even get off until after. cause my dad is working late. thursday and all. *sigh*  that's sad. and nadia and jordan might not go. and b/c i'm my sad and pathetic self it sucks.  *is rideless* ok that's enough whining for now. i'm hungry and i'm going to take some drastic measures to change this situation.

       mood:  murderous  music:  the sound of my blood boiling &nbsp; you know, for a while there, i actually had myself convinced this wasn't so bad. but NOOO. once AGAIN i am reminded why i hate being here so damn much. this lady makes me write five pages of crap just have some dude tell me that i don't even fucking need it. first: tasnia you need to write more then: tasnia you need to write less they can all fucking go to hell for all i care. did i ever ask for this? NO.&nbsp; do i ever know what the fuck they are talking about? NO. please, go ahead, ask me, tasnia, are you going to even be an engineer when you are older. Motherfucking NO. and they make it sound so easy.  I'M  &nbsp; the one who has to make a fool of herself in front of all these ppl trying to explain the acoustic responses of nanophased epoxy fucking resin.   why didn't i just quit when i had the chance?   (did i ever?)   and now i've only got 2 weeks left...less than that. i'm not going to give in now. they are holding onto money that is by all rights   MINE.   i hate it here. i hate it. i hate it. i hate. it.    and i'm mad tired.   if only i could just close my eyes, maybe this all would go away. i don't care about the damn ASTM.   i don't even know what it is. i don't care what they said. why do they want to torture me?   i won't answer any of their questions. no.   i'll just stand there. like a fucking fool.   and there is no one who could fix it.   advisor lady expects me to do all this shit myself.    yeah...no.   this isn't MY masters thesis.   I'M IN FUCKING HIGHSCHOOL.   it's 3...hopefully i'm only stuck in this hell hole for another two hours at most.   but then i get to go to blinkie's. and that will be good.   yet, that presents a whole nother hassle. getting rides. i hate it that i can't drive yet.   man. fuck.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  this is so pointless.

      *recalls her years in elementary school in ny*  &nbsp;  yeah don't ask.  so yesterday kellye came over! and that was neat. because i haven't seen her in like almost FOUR YEARS.  but it was cool cause she came over and we just talked like whatever and it was really cool that we could do that.  and then elizabeth came over and we talked some more. swapped the more interesting stories over the past years. and then we had to go over to her house... and that was ok b/c we were gonna go to hickory dickory with some ppl around 6 and she lives pretty close to it and all.  but sometimes. elizabeth and i don't agree in certain issues.  such as who we like and dislike.  i know she's free to have her own opinions but it doesn't fly too well with me when she doesn't get along with my friends.  and&nbsp;i felt a little awkward bringing them. just cause. i don't know. tis a long story. its like well kellye barely remembers ne1 and it's been so long...but i mean it's sad but i almost thought it would less awkward bringing her then bringing elizabeth. Especially when she openly admits her non favorage of someone I ADORE. so yeah. it sucks. i was attacked by aunt flow today. and she is MURDERING ME. and i blame YOU JORDAN. and nadia too with her faux signals. i hope my armpits worked on you!!!!  &nbsp;

       Mood:  *shrug* probably better not to ask  Music:  Untitled -- Interpol &nbsp; wait now i'm lying, it's obstacle one...so yeah. mood goes with either. the pets...they are nice. but i want to :  find new ways of living, make playing only logical harm  &nbsp; i don't neccesarily think i said nething wrong. i never get me, anyway.  it's not about me though. you couldn't really claim that i don't try. because i do. i try. and that's why things are the way they are. i like it just fine this way too. something seems wrong about tonight. and i can't quite put my finger on it. heh. i could make&nbsp;a few guesses. but no. i'm not gonna let it bother me. it'll go away tomorrow. this never lasts anyway. i couldn't keep it up. why? cause i'm too nice. my fucking curse. NO. i'm evil. i'm malicious. yes. i want to be.  i want to be cold. and aren't i? i'm awful. if you could only see...i don't deserve anything. but i do better than others. no, i'm wrong to say that.. what am i saying...no i'm not. i know.... whatever tasnia. &nbsp; it's just one of those nights where my life feels like the pieces don't fit together right. and there's something missing. and maybe there is something wrong with me.  i shouldn't even be talking about it. dammit. i'm ok. there's probably nothing wrong. it's just me. i'm paranoid.  paranoia. yes. &nbsp; it's late. &nbsp;

      yes...i am a comment whore...i admit it. &nbsp; but now ... holy whoppin whoa!!! my dad just called me up to say we just got some new pets!! isn't that freakish? but of course i won't totally believe it until i see them for myself but....i'm excited!! though our last pet experience wasn't that great. the fish incident: we have this trio of fish right. and everything is fine and dandy for a while. then one day my sister decides she wants to put a little plastic mermaid in the fish tank. seems harmless enough. but it turns out the color is toxic and it poisons one of the fish, and it dies. sounds bad right? yeah it gets worse. then we have to clean out the tank...so we do that, and it's going well until my dad accidentally fills the tank up with scorching (yes i am exaggerating) hot water. and the rest of them die too. yes. sad but true. maybe we'll have better luck with these. we got a birdie and a guinea pig. sounds fun. YAY!! haha my sister was the one who called me...hehe.  yeah i don't think i'm supposed to be getting personal calls at work but haha yesterday my dad called me to tell me to look at a car on ebay. my dad cracks me up. oh yes and i joined jonathan's forum today...and i don't completely understand how it works, and it's sad. and i feel stupid. but i will get the hang of it one day. i really want to go home. andy's having a thing tonight. and if all goes well kellye who i haven't seen in ages will be visiting tomorrow. and that will all be neat. &nbsp; yeah. &nbsp; i swear one of these days i WILL have something to say. &nbsp;

      yeah, i've been putting that up on my away message all of today, and it's in my head, so you get to see it again. teehee. and if you don't know what song it is, i'll have nothing to do with you. i'm just kidding...  anyways...everything here is...for lack of better word..crappy. i'm waiting for something interesting to do. but, dear me, nothing shall ever come!!!! arg. i'm supposed to be "working", but if you know me at all, you can understand how this doesn't quite fly well with me. i think i've done everything i can do...now i need someone else (who knows what they are doing )to do the rest of it. i wish i could use this time productively...maybe do my summer work or something. but no. all i can think to do is...blog...and look at random ppl's blogs...and it's fucked up b/c this damn machine won't let me comment. and oh, i would comment.  i bet you would like to watch me comment, wouldn't you? *seductive look* er..i was kidding there again...let's move on. once again this post has no point whatsoever...but it is something for me to do, and something for YOU, my bored one, to do as well. *thinks:  I'm just getting stranger by the minute...  max and jen leave for europe tomorrow. and i, *sniff* , am mad jealous. i would love to go to europe. i'm not going anywhere this summer.  except of course : CURIOSA. it is the highlight of my summer. not a bad one at that.  nothing better mess with it. or there will be hell to pay. *psycho theme* two weeks from tomorrow..*sighs dreamily* this comp's IM is screwed. i hate this place so bad. i wish i could quit. maybe i would get stuff done. and i wouldn't be haunted by all these fucking due dates. i can't believe i used to complain about sitting at home doing nothing. what i would give to have that back.  for some strange reason i've got that stupid country song stuck in my head...*is not a fan of country*...that old one...talking about "how do you like me now?" that and that muse song...weird combo. not that you care...but hell...if you are reading this...you must not have much better to do. the guy sitting right next to me is sleeping sitting up...it's nice to know i'm not the only lazy one in here. the other highschoolers don't do much either. mostly play games on the interenet.  not that i do much different. *sigh*  i should have brought something to do...but at least this way...if i have to, i can fake being productive.... yeah. i'm disappointed. this was pointless. *crosses her fingers for something interesting for next time*

       20 Questions to a Better Personality       Wackiness: 56/100 Rationality: 44/100 Constructiveness: 50/100 Leadership: 44/100    You are a WEDF--Wacky Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you a  menace to society , depending on how you channel your energies. You chew your fingers and have an addictive personality. Properly guided, you can be enormously productive--otherwise you run amok, stir up trouble, and generally have a hell of a good time.  To your friends, you are a source of relentless entertainment. You often get into trouble, but you almost always find a way out. You are strangely popular and feed off others' energy. You live hard, seize the day, and although your more sober friends would like to see you settled down, you generally have fewer regrets and better memories than they do. Your tenet is that, at the end of the day, one regrets only what one didn't try. You are right.  You could benefit from outside help in balancing your highs and lows. Or perhaps cutting back on the caffeine.    i've never thought of myself that way...but if the experts on some random quiz say so they must be right!! har...

      it's tuesday woohoo. and it sucked(and is continuing to suck) much arse. wow...i can't vary the things i say at all can i? but anyways...there is some good news to relate...my tickets for curiosa came in the mail yesterday, and now i'm going to run through the streets, naked, singing, I'M SO HAPPY. i hope everything goes well with timing and scheduling and all that mess. for some odd reason the gods decided to be cruel and make getting to this damn concert as hectic and hassle-loaded as they could. but i am going. and no one is going to stop me. AND. a complete stranger left a comment. another reason to run around naked...maybe this time just in my house..... i would leave a  comment back, but i'm at work and this computer is the queerest most horrendous thing on the face of the planet and is blocking the page where you can leave comments.  omfg. this horrid WE-Blocker thing is supposed to block sexually charged sites (apparently someone a while ago was caught looking at porn...and now they have these ldjgoautqw;lejkfa;l things on here) and things that are inappropriate. well how the hell is editting my blog sexually charged and inapproriate?!?!?!?!?!?!? dumb machines....*fumes* my report is coming along...sort of...i've got nine pages now...with a few of them only titled and mostly blank...but yeah...the minimum is ten...and i've got more pictures to add..so i'm doing ok. and then .... *evil smile* i'm gone from here forever!!!!!!!! mwahahahahahahahaha and then school starts...and i will go on hating day to day life. i was thinking about this the other day: i would really hate it if someone i dated turned gay. i mean sure it's good for them that they came out or whatever...but i would feel bad b/c in the back of my head i would be thinking "holy shit...i turned them gay." haha. maybe it will be a will and grace thing, and i will have a gay best friend...who i once dated....egh...point being...it would be a catatrophic blow to my poor little ego. in this sick demented way, because everything  IS  about me afterall.  thus far....i don't think anyone i've dated would turn gay....the last one turned "straight edge/hard core" ... but that's really not the same thing. ;) though his pants just do seem to get tighter and tighter every time i see him... and when a guys jeans are as tight as mine...i begin to wonder. *wonders if he'll ever read this...* most likely not... so anyways...this has gone on long enough.

      way to go, tasnia....now they know they are in for crappy reading... anyways...tis a monday...and that can only mean CRAPPY. my poor little nails are mutilated by that evil evil grinding machine. oh foul creature. it dislikes me.  and that's basically how i've spent my whole day here at work. and my fingers ache.  fuck. it's all in the name of science. hahaha. not. it's all in the name of MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! everything i have to do is overwhelming me. and my procrastinating nature does not help matters in the least. i really ought to change. maybe if i think about it hard enough...everything will get done by themselves.. *is such a wishful thinker* i think i am supposed to go out to eat today...mmmm...food... *thinks about food* *stops..and moves on* i shouldn't even publish this.             i love me my blinkie!!

      hmm...i honestly don't have a single thing to say. but i will blab on anyway. i went to see anchorman yesterday. it was good. funny. in that childish sense..but it made me laugh. and sometimes all we need is to laugh. victor and william were there. i haven't seen either of them in sometime. i think william is mad at me. he didn't neccesarily act it ... but he's probably fuming over me not calling him. and i'm sorry. but honestly don't call very many ppl. it's just nadia. i want to call ppl..but i'm usually a pussy. -_-; now that i think of it maybe that face is supposed to only have one sweat drop : -_-'  ehh...i think i like the two better... -_-; or -_-' *sigh* *won't admit there's a chance she's been putting the wrong face all this time* *her world is crashing down in front of her face* NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *recovers* O.o yeah...soo...after the movie me and jordan went to taco bell...and i won free cinnatwists from the little thingy where you put the coins in and you catch it and you win stuff? you know that thing? yeah that one!!i was so proud of myself. and then while everyone else could be merry over at andy's house, i on the other hand had to go to a stupid party with the parents. everyone from work was there...we left early for mother dearest, which was fine by me...but we left while some ppl were still coming in...haha...those late rascals.... otherwise i feel like i don't have much to say. and i think i related that in the very first line i wrote...now that i have managed to take up five minutes of your time...i do feel complete. ciao.

      i found this quite amusing:    You have a malicious soul! Malice, when defined means, The urge to see the sufferings of others But you dont really mean any harm to anyone, you just like to watch it. Mischievous, cruel, and seducing, you can hurt others with cruel words or just be plain mean. Prank calls, tripping people, and breaking the laws are your favorite past times. You can lie just as easily as laugh, even to a close one. People are intimidated by you because you never let people get close to you. Youre cold, ruthless, and pessimistic behavior drives people away, which show the pain you feel inside.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

      you know what? i just spent the last like 45 minutes answering this survey...i got about half way done and decided to delete it... i'm not entirely sure why. i don't really have much to say. i'm tired. i overslept today. which only makes me want to sleep more. i miss the summers where i didn't have to wake up so early. ~i miss the warmth of the summer, when we were on our own, but now it's winter my bones are cold.~ and i'm hungry...it's past lunch time and no one is putting food in my tummy. dad says he'll take me out to lunch sometime next week. that will be nice. my parents and i have a weird relationship. we can yell at each other until we make each other's ears bleed, and then make up like nothing that bad happeded. it's going to be sad when the day comes that i am fucked and out of luck, and they discover everything i've worked so hard to keep hidden. i wonder what they would actually do? accept it? no. never.  it's better it stays this way. nadia and i have discovered that we are not the only ones who have to be this way...i think we might have found ourselves a protege. hahaha. though i doubt others' stories are not exactly the way ours decided to wind, it's nice to know that we aren't utterly alone.  this was a pointless entry wasn't it? oh well. ~oh, well...oh, well...it's apparently nothing.~

      omfg...this is the saddest thing ever...but i just bought my very first thong....not one but  three !!!! -_-; sad, i know...but mother dearest thinks them ... i don't know the correct word to use... but they are in the vicinity of BAD. but, now, alas! the planets have aligned and it gives rise to oppurtunity. and now i have some money at my disposal, and the convience of arriving at shopping centers without the accompanyment of the parental units. so all is well. it is awful that i have to live life this way. a secret life...but it's not like they would understand...though sometimes i want them to...i was discussing this earlier with elizabeth...most often, when someone is taught something all their lives, it's hard to think any other way. of course this discussion stemmed from God...no..better yet...it stemmed from Catcher in the Rye. at the mention of it she went off on how much she hated that book..and that's all good and dandy, you are allowed your opinion...but i am looking forward to reading it. she said she hated how it lacked plot, and meaning...but that's fine. since when has real life had actual meaning? and then it went on to how she can't understand how someone can not believe in God. well...i'm sure ppl who don't believe in Him feel the same about ppl who do. i don't think it's wholly about understanding, and regardless of whether you do or don't...it's not up to you to criticize. maybe at one point in time, i too wouldn't understand...but that was when i was young and naive...and didn't understand much.. ok i'm getting off topic... the point is when something is drilled in your head since..well forever..it's hard to think of it in any other way. of course there are exceptions. ppl grow..and learn...change..and that's probably what's happened to me. and i don't mind it. i feel as though i've let go of so much that i thought i would hold on to forever...but...i guess nothing really is for forever.  i'm not who i was a few years ago, even one year ago...and i always ask myself if i like myself that way. and i can't give a straight answer. most of the time i don't like me at all...but at the same time, i can't imagine myself any other way. when it comes to most thing..you know? maybe this is how it was meant to be. haha, shall we call it fate? that would make it ironic wouldn't it?

(if that makes any sense)  music:  interpol, once again, for i left the cd in the laptop. it's on PDA, if you are curious. speaking of curious. i'm going to curiosa...haha. i have yet to order the tickets. but i'm thinking it will get done tomorrow. that's when that mofo zach leaves. ok, fine. he's not a mofo. but he called me ugly. ok, fine. he didn't  actually  call me ugly...but implied so. arg, ok...maybe it just seemed that way to me. i don't know why those things should bother me. but they don't exactly boost to your ego. similar thing happened with max...and no i'm not holding nething against either of them. though i might act as though i do. it's really myself. *admits zach and her are friends and she's really not holding nething against him or max for that matter* my self image hasn't been much of a confidence booster lately. i don't really understand why. i'll admit that there were things before about my body that used to appeal to me...but they don't anymore...i just don't see it. i think i might be even more self conscious than i used to be...i don't know. it's stupid. half the time i'm too lazy to do nething. i feel like i'm getting really fat. like hideously fat. obesity is something that can be fixed...your facial structure is not. unless maybe if i got plastic surgery. arg. let's not talk about this anymore. this kid i haven't talked to in forever just IM-ed me. after the stupidity incident...i don't really want to. i'm mean. i don't think i necessarily like being mean or maybe i do. i guess it depends. rambling, sorry.. it takes a long time just to get this all straight. i x-ed that dude i was talking about earlier. i almost felt bad doing it. but what actually made me feel bad was the fact i didn't really feel bad doing it.  man, i watched that sinbad movie today. and i hated it totally. i didn't like sinbad in it. he stole his best friend's girl. i hate those kinds of movies. they get on my fucking nerves. especially when there is absolutely nothing wrong with the third party. i actually liked him more than i liked sinbad. i'd hate the notebook if i watched it. i hated sweet home alabama. not only b.c it wasn't a great movie, but b.c the poor dude lost the woman he thought he loved. and i hate these movies. b/c most of the time i picture myself as that third party...the one who gets the bad end.  i'm sorry if this sounds like complaining (it's probably b/c it is...but) it's not like i've been all that lucky in the love department. yeah i don't feel like getting into this either. maybe someday in the future. or maybe not.  toodles.

       mood:  arg. i'm bored.  music:  INTERPOL.  and i'm sailing...yeah. i love me some interpol. and i am going to see them very soon indeed. yes. that's right. and i will be happy. and blinkie will interview mogwai, and she will be happy, and i will be happy as well b/c i will get to come along. :) i called that place, ticketmaster today, and it sucks b/c the good seats are all taken up. i don't know if i want to pay 58 dollars to sit in the backs rows...yeah. i will live. the lawn is fine. and we have good company, and that is important. ~this is a concept, this is a bracelet, this isn't no intervention~ BABY BABY YOU'RE REALLY THE BEST. i think i have it all ok-ed, now all i need to do is get cash from the others, or get ABSOLUTE assurance they will pay me back. that's done and settled. and the timing thing it gonna be ok, i believe. i'll skip the end of the summer lunch thingy, and all is well.  yes. i almost ran into someone today. it was hella close. i got seriously lucky.  mom's leaving again tonight. :( she won't be here for the 4th or the day after...i don't think we will be doing nething. jordan is planning of doing somethiing tomorrow, and hopefully i will get to do that considering i haven't done nething else this weekend. yeah. i resent it sure, but it should add to my points. they can't pull a "you've been doing too much" on me. i still feel bad about the little incident after chrissy's party. but it looks ok. and then there was spiderman, fuck, just when i promised myself that i would lay low for a while. sometimes, things don't want to go my ever. anyways, speaking of my patheticness, i've not been doing nething except playing minesweeper on the comp and listening to scar tissue on repeat, yeah sure i'll change it once in a while, but i still have an itch for it. i haven't stopped that for some reason. but lo and behold! i changed cd's today, and i listened to foo fighters...all the way through...for the very first time. but of course i go back to what i know. that's usual of me. i am so fucking bored. i want to go out and do something. but at the same time i'm so lazy too. i've said this many times and i'll say it again, boredom and laziness are a lethal combination.  this one's called stella was a diver and she's always down  i'll manage to find something to do...hopefully. yeah...true...i will be bitter and resentful the whole time, but i will do something. just don't know what.  i thought i had something to say. but i guess not anymore. i wish i could keep my mind on track for once.

       Mood:  not exactly what you call happy  i can't do nething tonight. and i'm not good with that. max is having someting at his house that i really wanted to go to. and i can't go. father dearest is being a prick. he won't even let nadia come over. what the fuck? i feel bad about the kitty. my heart breaks when I think about it. the rain has cleared. and my mood deepens. i don't know why the parents are so grr-ing. things are better than i thought it would be though. i know i don't always deserve. but i still wish things were different. i knew what would happen if i asked him...and i got exactly that. i'm searching for something reflecting my mood. i can't find nething. i should get off..i just like adding on to this for no reason. i wish at some point i'd have something to say.  side note: the day of my presentation is the same as curiosa. i think it will work out ok. i'm going to order tickets as soon as i can. yeah.   i'll let tonight go. or at least try my best to. i'll figure out the best way to play this out. i'll busy myself with pilates. be sore. and then shower. yeah. what a wonderful plan for a friday night. the sooner i get out of here the better. why can't it be raining again? or at least be dark.   a nice little storm like this. why do i always talk about the weather?

      i'm tired. oh wait here.  Mood:  tired. of everything.  yesterday i went to see spiderman 2 with my buddies. and it was all great fun. but i didn't enjoy it as much as i should of. why? well simple. ok maybe not so simple. but i will try my best to explain. the whole of spiderman had this theme of burden and unfulfillment...unhappiness...never getting what you want. and in my selfish pity, i thought how it reminded me of someone in this demented way. *sigh* and then of course there was the whole love thing. those always leave me bitter. but don't get me wrong. it was a good movie anyway. and then it was pretty late when the movie was over. and i know i should have called my parents. but if i had then they probably would have wanted me to come straight home. and i really didn't want to before talking for at least a little while. then nadia had to drop tom off. and i don't think it takes that long to do all of this. and we got home before it was 11:30. and my dad was all pissed about. as far as i'm concerned he can be pissed. i was hoping it would blow over by the next morning, but he still appears rattled. i don't know. i think i'm actually bothered that he's bothered. probably more so b/c he's gonna be bitchy about letting me do other stuff. why doesn't he understand that these things are the only thing that keep me happy? regardless of how flawed it is. it's something. i'd rather be any where than home sometimes. most of the time. i don't like how i feel . so isolated. why must they keep me trapped. i wish i could just run away. what do they worry about? that i'll do bad things? who's to declare what's good and what's bad? what's wrong and what's right? they can't tell the differance. and i can't make them see it my way. but that's all that matters. my way. i wish they'd just leave me alone. i can take care of myself. i've been doing that all this time haven't i? everything right under there noses. and they are better off not knowing. they can't handle it. they should just let me be. or i will not be happy. and i'm not happy. and i won't be happy until .... well...i don't really know.  is there need to talk more of this. i'm a bitch. that's there's no two ways about it. and i wish things would go my way for once.  and for a while it felt like it was ok. but i guess it goes along with my theory of balance. to add good points in one aspect of my life they gotta take away some from another.   i don't know. that's what i think. but whatever.   i'll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night. that is supposing that you don't sleep tonight.  it's like learning a new language, helps me catch up on my mime, if you don't bring up those lonely parts, this could be a good time. it's like learning a new language, you come here to me, we'll collect those lonely parts and set them down. you come here to me. she says brief things, her love's a pony, my love's subliminal.

       me reacting to some...new..things that seem to be around recently. and going off on a tangent about regrets. yeah. new things = weirdness well we all make mistakes in our lives. and me? haha i've made a quite a few. i don't like talking about, others i don't mind sharing. mostly b/c i didn't feel like i lost that much. one, i lost the time at a movie, thank God it was a watchable movie, or else it would've been a waste of money as well. and then there's that other one where the only thing i felt i lost was the 5 hour long telephone conversations about nothing. ok. there were somethings. like his views on the world and God and such. my reaction? well if i weren't the nice person i am, i probably would've told him to stop trying so damn hard. you're not that deep. i mean you think that dashboard confessional song has some sentimental value b/c you lost your virginity to some slut (who cheated on you like two days after you started dating) and now cry everytime you hear it. it's not like you didn't know she was a slut either. goddamn, i bet he made up the bit about crying. i hope so. it doesn't make you sensitive, it makes one pussyish. i have more depth in my pinky finger... and then i regret that when i lost my virginity to paul banks, i didn't have Daniel at the same time. ok. so maybe i'm kidding about that. where is this stemming from? well to me, it's pretty obvious. but to you dear reader, it's probably not. haha enter the vaguenesses of tasnia! mwahahahahahaha. i guess it has something to do with me feeling weird around things. or well ppl (duh) but i guess i shouldn't. it's like different worlds colliding. and they shouldn't. they should have stayed put! and that's my story. well i guess it wasn't much of a story...i felt like a good rant.

       ok so i wrote this really long blog and i had just hit publish when my dad decided to be an asshole and disconnected me off the the internet and i lost the entire thing, and unfortunately there is no way for me to retrieve it in anyway, and i'm stark raving mad.   i don't feel like saying everything i said over.   so yeah.   this is a sucky substitute.      ok fine. the title should've been "our hearts are just made out of strings to be pulled" which i thought was a good title...it wasn't interpol this time at least...i said something like my mood was nothing special   and i was listening to modest mouse, but the cd has ended now and i'm not listening to nething.   and that i'm looking forward to william's thing tomorrow b/c i want to hang out with my ppl.   and i liked my english class and mr. jones seems pretty cool.   i took bryan and thomas yualskasdklfjsl he spells his last name something weird but it sounds like yule like in yule tide cheer or whatever. and yeah. and we went to get smoothies at smoothie king, and i drank mine impossibly slow b/c i just finished mine right now.   then i had gone to their house, and by their i mean bryan's , house and we talked about nothing, which is regular and i didn't feel like doing nething with them today and it was weird b/c usually i like to hang out with bryan. but now come to think of it, it varies. but yeah.    and i want to go hang out with nadia today, that's what i said.   then i also said something along the lines of i happen to be the only single person. but that's not really true. there's lots of single ppl in the world haha. but like i'm thinking about some of my close friends, and before it was like nadia...and now it's like argh everyone. or so it seems to me anyways.   and then i said " i hate having no one to think about " and that is true all the time.   and i can't really do nething about it b/c it just doesn't feel like there is anyone that is "right" for me or whatever. and something about standards. oh yes. i never feel like i have very high ones, but i need  something  if that makes sense. and then i realized that i was complaining. so i decided to stop.   well that's the condenced version. it's probably better that way. no one has to hear me complain and ramble on for too too long, you know?   yeah. i think i'm hungry, and i should eat. so yea.            ((and yes this is the color and font i had it in before...))

          mood:  insert big fat question mark here>     music:  Take You On A Cruise -- Interpol        well...that's it for the first day of school. and i have no idea how i feel about it. i can't say i liked it. i can't say i hated it. i am totally indifferent to it.   no.   maybe not.   i feel like something was missing from it. and i can't pinpoint what it was really.   i just feel incomplete. i don't know. it reminds me of freshmen year a little bit. and that's not a good thing by any means.   it's only the first day, i can't say nething after only the first day.   apparently nadia's day was so bad she's considering IB. that kind of makes me sad. well...it's hard to explain. but honestly, i've always had scruples over picking AP or IB.   and i've talked about this so much before..but i mean i thought i had put all that behind me, and i was finally convinced that AP was the right choice for me. and part of it was nadia reassuring me, you know?   and now it's like my classes are ok i guess, i mean i can live with it.   but there are so many good ppl in IB and i wouldn't mind being there with them. but i don't see how it would benefit me in anyway. i feel like i wouldn't have enough time for myself.   and i wouldn't be able to survive the way i do.   i get by. and even without IB i'm thinking this year is gonna be tough.   i have no confidence in nething. not even my intellect. so why would i think that i would be able to do this?   and still there's something missing, and i don't even know what it is.    i don't feel---i don't know. maybe i don't feel anything and that's what's weird.   so typical me. we've barely begun school and i'm already hastening to complete stuff. and waiting until the last minute.   in the end i don't see how a IB degree will help me.    but then again the other side of me thinks...it may. but i'm doing the same damn thing.   i don't get it.   god.   stupid feeling of inadequacies.   then again, i've already labled myself insatible...    there is love to be made, so just stay here for this while     perhaps heartstrings resusitate the fading sounds of your life    i'm tired.

       hmph.   i hate history.   i hate it. i hate it. i hate it.   but i have to do it. but i took a break...i felt like doing this instead. b/c of course there is absolutely no point in it what so ever.    we rejoice cause the hurting is so painless from the distance of passing cars    i wish this summer would last forever.  i enjoyed more than most.   sure nothing terribly exciting (save curiosa) happened... (welll that and my license and etc)   but nothing in some other things i usually hope for...   but that's all irrelevant   the point i'm trying to make is that, the friend thing was good.   i liked it. it was the summer of the bubble.   i don't know if the bubble is a good thing...just b/c well i'd prefer my fellow bubblians to anyone else. sort of. i don't know nemore.   nevermind.   it's like i'm sad b/c not a lot of bubble members are in classes with me. and i'm afraid the bubble might deteriorate over the year. and i'd be heartbroken. b/c i've come to be close to my bubble.   and i really like the ppl in my bubble.   and i want to keep it like this. i don't want school to start. i don't want to think about it.   what if i don't like ne of my classes?   maybe i'll drop out. dammit. no i won't.   i have to go pick up my parking spot tomorrow. i hope nothing bad happens, and i don't get it or something.   i'm sorrry this was so useless, i swear i thought i was going to say something, and it was going to be interesting, and i would feel good about it.   but apparently not.   now i shall try and force myself off the internet and get to working on that damn summer work.

       ...remembuh!....  uh...good morning! ((*sings* good mooooornin')) it's early, and i'm hungry.   Mood:  oh hunger yet no will to do anything about it  Music:  Let's Get it Started -- the BEPs well...that's what's on tv and my sister has this newly developed fixation on radio disney...channel 940 yo. -_-;  i really really really need my license. i never thought i would get a car before i got my fucking license. but that is the way it seems to be going. *sigh* last night, i went to Moe's with blinkie, zach, ashley, nadia and jordan. and it was neat. and then jd and will came and we ate, and had a nice little convo about masterbation. then we went up to coldstone. but no ice cream for tazzy. cuz she was full. oh yes she was. but then jd and will left. and we went over to jordan's to watch clockwork orange. what a motherfucking strange movie. those crazy europeans. i don't really think i have nething to say, i don't know what was the point in this. i think i shall steal the television from my sibling, and feed myself. i have stuff to do. school's in a week. *can't believe she just said that.* and i still have so much fucking shitty things to do. grrz. i think blinkie and nadia might spend the night tomorrow night. that will be fun. and we'll watch the party. ahh...childhood memories. tis a link to my innocence. teehee. i haven't been obsessed in a while. i'll be ok. i think. anyways. the day is young. and i have the oppurtunity to accomplish something. i will try.

       today we had some ppl over..and my dad went a bit crazy with the food preps...it was all good. now we have food in the house...though it's kind of all snacky.   well these ppl from eufaula (sp?) came by. they are really nice ppl. we had gone to visit them once. sometime around this time last summer i believe. but this time their daughter was with them.  she seemed nice also. my dad wants her to be my role model. and i can understand why. she's pretty, she's smart, and getting to be successful. she's only 29 and already started her practice. he was dressed smart too. her hair was perfect, her make up was perfect, and she spoke perfectly.   they invited my sister and me to their house to spend a few days there. it's really nice of them to offer..but a little on the awkward side. i've only met them twice. (my dad works with the husband sort of) they are nice oldish ppl. ok, fine..they aren't old but they are at least 10 years older than my parents.   their family has this whole brady bunch deal going on..but i won't get into it.   and it's hard to explain...kind of....*sigh* i won't get into that either.   they stayed a few hours, and yeah...we didn't need all the food we bought. *sigh*   gosh this was a boring post.   i'd get into curiosa but i still don't feel like it.   sorry ashpash.
