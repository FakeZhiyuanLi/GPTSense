      Oi vey! Can I just say that??? I'm getting so sick of myself... So, there was this guy I was in this play with back in October. He fell for me- and at the time, it seemed pretty bad. You know, he was a great guy- a lot of fun, easy to talk to, some really cool insights into the world. And really, I liked him- a LOT. But you know what? He wasn't a Christian, so obviously, I told him "No." Twice- in no uncertain terms. (In fact, I warned him away from me- he knew I was struggling, and I told him that there was no way I could give up my relationship w/ the Lord for ANY guy- and that he would just get hurt.) OK- so fine and dandy. He backed off, and I am assuming, went on with his life. So what's my problem? I'm still thinking about him- in JUNE (almost July). I still dream about him, wish I could talk to him... GRRRRRR. I turned him down. I told him no. I haven't even SEEN him since January (God's made sure of that.) I KNOW he's not right for me- and yet...  I've prayed about it. I've begged God to take my feelings away (or to save him so it would be cool!) but to no avail. I've tried being interested in other guys. I even went on Eharmony- and all I kept thinking was that none of the guys fit right- I kept freakin' comparing them to a guy that I can't have and really, I know I don't want to have.  WHAT IS MY PROBLEM?????!!!! AM I DEMENTED OR SOMETHING????? Ok. I'm done. If you see this- pray for me. Thanks :)

      Man- I didn't know law students could be so ignorant...  I was just looking up the whole  urlLink petition   at Berkley about John Yoo's supposed  urlLink advocation   of war atrocities during a memo given to the department of defense - thinking that my more conservative-minded friends could possibly be wrong, that maybe there was something hinted there (after all, the media can't be ALL  wrong, right? Oi.)   Still- looking at the  urlLink memo  (which was, you'll note, specifically requested by the department of defense) It seems meant to be an unbiased account -note the last sentence of the very first paragraph!  In addition, reading through what I can see of the memo (I couldn't get access to other sites that had it- is there any site gives the whole memo that I don't have to pay for?), it looks to give a fair view to what would be considered a war crime and under what circumstances. It provides legal precedents, expounds on the language of the law and even discusses a trend of interpretation that doesn't fit the text well (see the discussion on the 3rd Phase of the interpretation of article 3). It also well as notes another memo being sent out to discuss the legal proceedings if the country were to keep prisoners of war in Guantanamo Bay (pg 2)  So what made the students at Berkley so upset? I mean, they ARE law students... shouldn't they be able to tell a document stating the facts in a law from a document favoring a specific action? Hmmm... maybe they just know something the rest of us can't see ;) (Or maybe it's because they come from a society that believes all this  urlLink stuff ...)

      My crazy best friend...  So yeah, just when I think I've got guys all figured out... my best friend and I were talking today about a situation she's in- she knows some guy likes her, right? And she's been kinda holding out to let him take the lead ('cuz that's something she feels he really needs to do.) Then suddenly, on Wed., this other guy gets all affectionate with her- holding her hand, dancing w/ her, wrapping his arms around her waist, etc. Except HE'S just supposed to be her friend... and he's also supposed to be interested in another girl... huh?  Of course... she doesn't know what she feels about either of them... oi vey!

        The Lost Along the Way of Omelas   Looking in their eyes: Incredulity. “Yes,” they say, “It’s better.” Perplexity. Astonishment. How could I not see the obvious?  The suffering of one:  Innocence.  That suffering gives contentment to all. Happiness. Enjoyment. Surely it’s worth a child’s pain!  Still looking at them: Unbelief. Where, then, is compassion? Empathy? Love? Is it worth the pain to save another?  Later, sitting alone: Contemplation. Can one know happiness without pain? Delight? Sorrow? If there is not one, can you value the other?  There must be both: Realization One cannot learn true pleasure Without true mourning.   This poem was inspired by a discussion I had with some students while substituting at an area high school. They were a great group, and we had some good discussions. At one point, they suggested I read the short story they had recently studied, called “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” by Ursula K. LeGruin (It was, I discovered later, the mild version of the story.) I did read it, and our discussion afterward led me to write several poems, firstly in despair at their calloused responses, and then in rebellion against that callousness. This poem is a sort of mediation between the two feelings.

      Yeah, so I went to a friend's wedding this last weekend. Wow- it was so gorgeous! I mean, I'm not usually a big one for sitting through weddings (yeah, I know, strange for a girl) but this one was so neat. Jewels looked so perfect- and she did so much work on the church and everything... I was super excited for her. She's been through so much in life, and it looks like she's marrying into a terrific family. (I loved watching the interaction between Brett and his siblings- his face broke into a smile on seeing each one of them walk down the isle, and he had something small to say to each one as they reached by the altar.) Yeah, jewels!  Ok, anyway, I'm not writing simply to ooh and ahh over a beautiful wedding. I am rather, wanting to contemplate the concept of dancing at a wedding. Yes, I know, deep and philosophical, but really... many of the folks at my church and in the circles that run around my church are vey anit-dancing, and epecially social dancing. I guess I don't really understand the problem behind it all. I mean, yes, there are dances that I do not agree with (unless they're between married couples) but really, dancing, I think, can be truly positive. 1) Dancing (especially some of the silly dances we started out with) gives an opportunity to break the ice, and get people interacting with one another that might not otherwise know where to start. At a wedding, that means the diff between people enjoying themselves and and sitting around a table going "Yep.. we're at a wedding... yep... we're eating food, yep..." 2) Dancing, at a wedding at least, allows interaction between the guests of honor and the rest of the party. Instead of dwelling on how quickly they could get out of there( yes I KNOW how important that is for them), Jewels and Brett were chatting and having fun with their guests- it made the day more special and memorable for everyone. 3) There was dancing in Biblical times- the tradition of Jewish dancing goes all the way back (at least) to the Israelites crossing of the Red Sea (check out Exodus 15). David is known for dancing with nothing but his "linen ephod" on (see 2 Samuel 6:14) 3) Our taboo on dancing is more of a cultural than biblical thing. Most cultures view dancing as a matter of course- yes there are ways to let dancing get out of control, but really, I'm not sure it has to be. 4)Dude- it's exercise! How many Americans could use a LOT more of that??!! Alright I'm done on my soap box :)

      Well, I've been meaning to set up a blog for sometime now...I'll randomly get the urge to write something down and share the world, but then I've never found one I really liked before. I visited a guy's site here ( http://transplantedtexan.blogspot.com/ ) , and decided I liked it. So, here goes!  This blog will probably be probably mostly scattered thoughts on my part (as indicated by the title!) and perhaps (if I ever figure out how) I'll let others join in on it as well :)
