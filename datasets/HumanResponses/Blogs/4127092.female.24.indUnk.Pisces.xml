      Why. i dont know why i feel depressed. im worried about alot, but i cant seem to get my thoughts into order. we are running out of food, as to be expected. getting paid once a month tends to decrease the amount of  things to buy at once. specially since i havent been paid in six weeks.  outside of that life is good. i love living. i love my son. i  love me, i can live with the person i've become.  im thinking about kris. i think im falling in love with him again, only i dont know why. i dont know why he likes me. i used to think it was only physical, but since having ty, my body has gone to shit, and he still likes me. he himself is a good person to hang out with. we get along, very well, when we have the least interruptions by people telling us what is "best for us". he is not the most fantabulous looking person, but he is soo honest, and real, and he is quite cute.... he's very much like me. he has never lied to me, but he took me for granted.  im still his. he is still mine. he has had some indescretions, but he is still mine.  i have never had anyone else. i dont want anyone else. i used to think i wanted to expirience sex with another person. i had my chance, but i didnt...it was just wrong. i couldnt move past the fact i felt it was just so wrong. emotionally, i didnt feel anything for him, the man i had my chance with. i wanted another person, my current best friend at the time. that person is now out of my life. i wonder, what makes me soo attached to men? i was attached to another Chris for over 4 years, before he made it perfectly clear nothing would ever happen. i was attached to Mike for 6 years before he stood me up on a visit that took alot out of me....the only person i didnt want to attach to was the one i married. now, i feel so attached to him. he completes me, in ways the other two do not.  and im terrified of that. im supposed to be in control of things, they are supposed to work on my terms..... im not supposed to need a man so much. i can be complete without one. cant I? why him? he's not the picture of my ideal person. he...is fluffy. does not want to wear the pants in a relationship. is willing to be a stay at home dad, which i think is such a wimpy goal...i was supposed to be the stay at home mom, he was supposed to work. we were going to buy a house,  and pay off our cars, and our lives were going to be perfect. now im a single mom. i've accomplished my financial goal of paying off my car, aquiring insurance on my own, living in my own apt (with a roomie, of course) taking care of ty...and kris wants me back. why? but then, he never wanted me to leave in the first place. what is wrong with wanting things the way they were? life would be so much better if he would have courted me and built a house for us and prepared a place for us to be a family. do i want him back? i do. why? i miss him. he is my other half. but i dont know why. should i know why, or how one person completes another? is it explainable?  my thoughts have run out, for today...

      in lieu of correct punctuations  this is a new blog. my lovely friend, kimmy told me about this site. i think it was briliant of her. i do have many many contemplations. i just hope i remember to write them all down. first of, i think i will thank God for good friends, and giving me just enough. all through life, he has given me just enough. and i never realized it. now, out on my own, i have just enough...and no worries becasue of it. :-) i also would like to thank God for good friends. i dont have many, but i do love the ones i have. they mean so much to me, and i wish i could be able to see them through life as they see me. My son comes next, he is truely a blessing, in his two year old body. i think, without him, i would have been lost.  time is now, 3:44 pm. i will pick him up in 15 minutes. anyways, lately, my life has been hectic. i've started a new job, and love it. but i dont really like those i work with. i have resoslved to work for my residents only, and not for my employee's. i also got another job offer, should i want one...its working for my neighbor. lots more money, but i dont see the security available that i have with this job now. so i think i will stick with my job, and see what happenes. im also conteplating, well, actually, i want to get back together with my ex husband. i have fought this for so long, well, actually about a year. we got divorced for the wrong reasons. Immaturity, primaraly. but now, i dont know. i feel older, much more in control of me. but i dont know about him. im learning to accept him as he is, but i dont know. he is human, and a man, and he has many many flaws. but none of them are so detrimental i cant work with it, or through it. i do want him back.....  sigh. there is still so much i wonder. i think, i'll jet for now. but i'll be back.
