         Yes, you too can be flung from a  urlLink Trebuchet , and for the bargain price of roughly $80!  Of course, that doesn't cover the incurred medical costs of retrieving your testicles or breasts from your shoes after the ride, but hey, it's all good.   urlLink These people  have taken a  urlLink Northern Exposure  episode to extremes.  Famous female flingee (say that three times),  urlLink Scaredevil Stella , looks like she's not taking her meds, and their hero, Perfect Paul, is destined for a public dirt nap.  At least you can commend them for trying to promote diversity in their ranks.  In addition to Stella and Paul, they enlisted a retiree named  urlLink "Dangerous" Dave "Captain" Kirke , as their chairman.

       urlLink    Back in the early 80's (junior high years), I went with my cousins, who live in the Dallas area, to  urlLink Six Flags over Texas .  It was the largest Amusement park I had ever visited (other than Disney World when I was younger), and was filled with fun and adventure.  The picture above is of the roller coaster  urlLink Shock Wave .  It was the one ride that we all feared, yet yearned to ride.  Eventually we all rode the beast that day, and even bought buttons that said "I Survived the Shock Wave."&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I remember back in junior high/high school we used to play "Air Guitar."  Granted, back then it was somewhat cool, but still dorky.  But come on people, it's 2004, and  urlLink these people  take it seriously.  This year's winner, MiRi "Sonyk-Rok" Park, who did a "rousing" rendition of Van Halen's "Hot For Teacher", seems to be a departure from past winners who look as though they are stuck in the 80's.  I think her short school girl skirt and flashing her white panties sealed the victory.  Hell, the majority of other contestants and judges haven't seen panties in years, other than in store displays or the  urlLink Victoria's Secret  catalogue they "pour" over.  Ms. Park was even invited to show her "stuff" on Conan O'Brien, and also included her full frontal panty shot.  The Air Guitar World Championships are being held in Finland later this year, and unless one of the other contestants can show more female skin or invoke the Air Guitar God, I think Ms. Park will be "crowned" the winner.&nbsp; urlLink    urlLink

       urlLink CNN.com : Bush & Co. have continued there assault on our nation's forests, this time by allowing a 665-acre timber harvest in a roadless (ie., untouched and beautiful) area of Tongass National Forest in Alaska.  Why did they do this, and why did they lift the anti-logging ban that was in place but scrapped earlier this year?  TNF supervisor Forrest Cole stated, "Supporting our local communities is an important part of what we do and offering these timber sales is a way we can accomplish that goal.  My hope is these timber harvests will help out our local family-run mills keep operating and create jobs."  Cole is a traitor to the Forest he supervises...

       urlLink CNN.com : Former US Park Police Chief Teresa Chambers, who was put on administrative leave 7 months ago after speaking to reporters and congressional staffers about the budget dilemma facing the Park Police, was fired on Friday.  Chambers asserts that it was her dissenting opinion of the Bush Administration's non-allocation of funds to support increased duties and security at National Landmarks, or so called "Icons", which led to her dismissal.  This incident of silencing criticism of the White House follows the departures of Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and counterterrorism expert Richard Clarke, who left or were forced out by the Bush Administrationn for the same reason.  So much for Freedom of Speech under Bush.

America and the world in general are in much more danger due to Bush's lies, deception and imperialist doctrine.  Bush goes as far as saying that although no WMD were found, Iraq had the capability to manufacture them.  So now it's just the "capability to manufacture" something that is grounds for war?  God help us all if the administration continues to use that line of reasoning with countries such as Iran, North Korea and China.

President Bush has stated that he supports Israel and the wall, and Israel has stated that it will not stop building it.  One of the main reasons the US is hated to such an extent in the Middle East is beacuse of its' blank check of support for anything Israel desires.  When are we going to actually to listen to Palestinian concerns??

Her complaint is not the first either, as it seems Mr. Lubbers gets grabby when it comes to the female derriere.  Lubbers has written her a letter that in part states that if she dropped the complaint she would suffer no career consequences.  Huh??  Excuse me, but what the hell kind of offer is that?  She is the victim, and yet by letting the ignoramus go she won't suffer a career block?  The UN needs to fully investigate Mr. Lubbers, and then promptly give him the boot.  If that kind of stuff happened in the places I have worked, the person would have been sacked.  I see no difference in Mr. Lubber's case, no matter if he is a former Dutch Prime Minister.

       urlLink CNN.com : Yeah, right.  This is called "Big Stick" diplomacy, and originated with Teddy Roosevelt back in 1907.  All of us should remember his saying from history classes, "Speak softly, but carry a big stick."  The Summer Pulse '04 naval exercises are the largest of it's kind since 1907 when the  urlLink "Great White Fleet"  circumnavigated the globe in an effort to show US naval power.  Summer Pulse is just a reincarnation of it, no matter how the US administration or US Navy tries to spin it, and will undoubtedly create more hatred of the US and it's imperial interests, not to mention possibly creating serious diplomatic tensions with world powers such as China.  If you've been following US/China relations lately, Taiwan is still trying to establish it's independence from China, which has not been going all to well.  One of the ports of interest for Summer Pulse is, yes, you guessed it, the general area of Taiwan, within striking distance of China.  I guess we shouldn't be surprised with a person like Rumsfeld at the helm...

       urlLink The Salt Lake Tribune : Utah Senator Orrin Hatch gave his endorsement of federal judicial nominee, J. Leon Holmes, from the senate floor while reading from the bible.  What's special about this is that Holmes has written numerous controversial articles regarding, among other things, a woman's place in marriage, namely a subservient one.  In Holmes', "Gender Neutral Language, Destroying an Essential Element of Our Faith," he states that "the woman is to place herself under the authority of the man" in marriage and "is to subordinate herself to the husband."  I had to read the date of this article twice as I thought I must have read it wrong....1997.  What's even more special is that according to the SLT, Hatch himself said, "millions and millions of people will agree with his view."  If a senator from any other state had said this, he would have been run out on a rail that night, but since we are talking about Utah, the bastion of Mormonism, he will become even more popular...go figure.

Instead of stating all the positives of Cheney's leadership (lol, cause there aren't any), they instead attack Edwards on his inexperience.  Well, I for one would rather have someone who is inexperienced but eager to learn than someone who has managed to alienate nearly every nation in the world.

Ahhh, another Republican and his anti-populace ways.  When are you mainstream Republicans going to realize that the only people your party cares about are the upper 10% of the population (income wise, of course)?  What this country needs is an enema, and hopefully it'll be a nice big one come November.

As I said in an earlier post, Bush & Co. only care about money and their fat-cat conservative friends.  Having Bush in the White House is a world crisis, and we need to exercise our right to vote him out this November, otherwise we have no-one to blame but ourselves for the hate we experience outside of our great country.

      (Reader forwarded) WINFIELD, W.Va. - Putnam County Sheriff's Deputy John Hedrick was surprised when a speeding vehicle he was chasing squealed into a county parking lot and its driver got out and ran toward a judicial annex. Turns out, the suspect was late for a very important date - in court.   "I thought it was kind of a weird situation, but it kind of worked out all right," Hedrick said. "He got to court, then he got the ticket."   The chase began Wednesday when a vehicle zoomed past Hedrick's cruiser at 60 mph in a 35 mph zone on U.S. 35. Hedrick pursued the vehicle, with his cruiser's lights flashing and siren blaring, as it turned up a hill and headed toward a cluster of county buildings.   The vehicle screeched to a stop in a parking lot outside the sheriff's department and the driver, Charles Daniels of Beckley, ran toward the judicial annex. Hedrick captured the man and discovered why he was in such a hurry.   "He was late for a court hearing," Hedrick said.   Hedrick let Daniels make his court date and alerted a bailiff. When Daniels left the courtroom, he was taken to the sheriff's department and cited for speeding and driving on a suspended license.

      (From the  urlLink Daily Mis-Lead )  On the same day that President Bush announced plans to investigate Iran for ties to terrorism,1 Halliburton acknowledged that "a U.S. grand jury issued a subpoena to the company seeking information about its Cayman Islands unit's work in Iran,2 where it is illegal for U.S. companies to operate." Earlier this year, CBS News reported that Vice President Dick Cheney was CEO of the company "during which time Halliburton Products and Services set up shop in Iran."3 In fact, Cheney was so adamant about doing business with terrorist nations like Iran, he even went abroad to publicly attack American foreign policy after meeting with top officials from a foreign government.   Despite economic sanctions on Iran because of its ties to terrorists, Cheney openly bragged about Halliburton's business dealings there during the 2000 campaign.4 Cheney argued that it was ethical for Halliburton to use "independent foreign subsidiaries" that exist in tax shelter countries like the Cayman Islands to skirt U.S. law. He also went abroad to attack American policy: According to the Malaysian News Agency, Cheney publicly attacked U.S. sanctions on terrorist countries after a meeting with top Malaysian government officials in Kuala Lampur.5   During the 2000 campaign, Cheney also claimed that, as Halliburton CEO, "I had a firm policy that we wouldn't do anything in Iraq,6 even arrangements that were supposedly legal." Yet, earlier this year, The New Yorker reported "during Cheney's tenure7 at Halliburton the company did business" in Iraq as well. The Washington Post reported that despite strict economic sanctions, Halliburton did up to $73 million in business8 with Iraq while Cheney was heading the company.   Sources:  1. "Bush: U.S. probes possible Iran links to 9/11," CNN.com, 7/19/04. 2. "Halliburton Subpoenaed Over Unit's Iran Work ," Reuters, 7/19/04.  3. "Doing Business With The Enemy," 60 Minutes, 1/25/04.  4.

      (From an e-mail list I am on for the website,  urlLink True Majority .)  First, candidate Bush said we needed to give millionaires a huge tax cut because the surplus was too big.  Then President Bush said it was because the economy was in recession.   Now America has a record deficit and the economy is still dragging. At the same time, millions of our kids need health care, Head Start, and decent schools—and there’s no money to pay for them.  What’s Bush’s solution?  You guessed it.  Stay the course! Continue cutting taxes for rich folks and leave basic needs unmet at home and abroad.  Oh, and let our kids deal with the fiscal and social mess sometime in the future – after he’s out of office anyway.  This time, Bush wants to extend $75 billion in tax cuts for years into the future. These cuts are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Bush’s backers want to push the giant tax cut extension through the House this week, before lawmakers head out of town for vacation, and then celebrate the victory at the Republican convention this August.  If you want to send your Representative a message (text below) calling on Congress not to extend any of Bush’s irresponsible tax cuts, and you’re a TrueMajority member, just click “Reply” and “Send” in your email program.   If this message was forwarded to you or you’d like to customize the message to your Representative, click here:   urlLink http://action.truemajority.com/index.asp?action=10182&ms=txct1   Here are the facts: Under Bush’s three tax cuts to date, the wealthiest one percent of millionaires (with annual incomes of over $335,000) will be keeping an extra $60,000 this year—and for the next six years. Folks who make less than $16,000 per year (the poorest 20 percent) will get $100 or less in tax cuts this year (Citizens for Tax Justice,  urlLink www.ctj.org ).  Meanwhile the federal deficit has risen to over $400 billion—the highest in American history—and it’s projected to grow even higher next year (Congressional Budget Office,  urlLink www.cbo.gov ).  Yours for responsible fiscal policy,   Andrew Online Organizer  Here’s the letter we’ll send to your Representative:  Dear Representative:  I understand that President Bush is pushing legislation, HR 1308, requiring that $75 billion in tax cuts be extended into the future.  With over 10 million kids in our country lacking health insurance and millions of kids starving abroad, there’s no reason to renew these $75 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy. They should be allowed to expire, as planned, in January 2005, and the savings should be directed toward meeting basic unmet needs at home and abroad.  Please, don’t extend the tax cuts.  Sincerely,  (We'll put your name and address here.)

       urlLink Boston Globe : (Thanks to a reader for forwarding this to me) Interesting article on Michael Moore, "Fahrenheit 9/11" filmmaker, and his frequent anti-American populace outgassings while in foreign countries.  With the release of his film, too many anti-Bush people have heralded him as being a savior of sorts, exposing the Bush administration's serious shortcomings.  Although I am pleased that he did make "Fahrenheit 9/11", (if for nothing else than to nudge those people on the fencepost to the democrat or moderate side of the vote), I do not think that everything coming from his mouth is gold.  Just as with any person who speaks publicly on the issues, citizens need to objectively examine all statements, and not just the ones that get major press attention or theatre time.  An interesting point about Moore's film is that what he speaks about is nothing new if you surf the web and read the news, or more importantly, independent news sources.  In fact, I would garner to say that the movie's credits should list the multitude of individuals who have put themselves out on the web with information and news that the mainstream press will not cover.

      (Thanks to a reader, who wishes to remain anonymous, for informing me of this video)  I think we have all seen stills from the beheading videos that have been posted on the net.  What we haven't all seen is what the US military is capable of, and does on a frequent basis in Iraq.  I am posting a link to this video from the site Consumption Junction.  The reason I am posting just the download link to the video is because that site takes pride in hosting the sickest videos and pictures a person could hope not to see.  If you end up not only downloading the video, but also visiting the site, don't come back to me complaining, as   I have already warned you  .  That is why I have posted only the download link for the video.  This is not a close-up video of someone dying, it's taken from either a US warplane or helicopter, and it seems to be from about 1000ft or so above the ground.  What I hope you will find objectionable is the US military's complete and utter disregard for human life.  There is no identification in this video that these people are terrorists, or are attacking the US.  What it shows is a small, loosely packed crowd walking down the street...and then the US ends that all.  The commentary from the pilot and his command are chillingly simple and concise.  The phrase "Takem' out" should echo in your head for quite a while.  Click on  urlLink this link  to download the video.

       urlLink Electronic Journal of the U.S. Department of State - Volume 5, Number 3, October 2000 :  (Reposted per reader request)  A couple of quotes and promises from Bush's acceptance speech, worthy of examination in light of the current election:     "Bush said that when he is president, 'We will seize this moment of American promise. We will confront the hard issues -- threats to our national security, threats to our health and retirement security -- before the challenges of our time become crises for our children.'"      Interesting, as he has failed in all those hard issues. Our national security is worse now than it's ever been due to his infatuation with his war in Iraq, not to mention that every Arab terrorist group in the world wants a piece of us. Health insurance costs are still outrageously pricey, and fewer Americans have coverage than before he took office. His confronting of retirement security is also a farce as his new Medicare rules put many retirees at risk.       "Bush said that he faulted the administration for its stands on education, the military, Social Security and health care."       Bush's stance on education can be summed up by his action of drastically reducing the budget for the Head-Start program, and it's cousins. It's obvious that he does not care about those children who desperately need that program, which provides stability and consistency to assist in childrens' education and well-being. Bush knows that the children that are really important to him, the ones from privleged and wealthy families, do not need this program due to their pedigree.  Bush's stance on the military is a confusing one. He would rather use taxpayers dollars to pay private security firms (mercenaries) that are run by his wealthy corporate friends, than a citizen who is enlisted in the armed forces of the US. Our soldiers are pawns in Bush's imperialist campaign for power and profit, and they deserve a President who knows what it's like to face enemy fire, and not one that runs and hides with his family's help.    "On one side are wealth and technology, education and ambition. On the other side of the wall are poverty and prison, addiction and despair," he said. The wall must be torn down, he said, but "big government is not the answer." He said the alternative is to put conservative values and ideas into the fight for justice and opportunity. "This is what I mean by compassionate conservatism. And on this ground we will govern our nation," Bush added."     Compassionate conservatism...interesting spin on what amounts to "helping the rich get richer and the poor get poorer."   "The world needs America's strength and leadership, and America's armed forces need better equipment, better training and better pay," he said. "We will give our military the means to keep the peace, and we will give it one thing more -- a commander-in-chief who respects our men and women in uniform, and a commander-in-chief who earns their respect."   True, the world does need America's strength and leadership, it's too bad that Bush didn't do the things necessary to see that happen, and instead opened up a can-of-worms called the Iraq war. As far as giving our military the tools and the numbers to "keep the peace," Bush has also failed miserably. He states that he respects our men and women in uniform, but just not enough though to have actually served in a war-time theatre, and instead served in comfy Alabama. Couple that with Cheney and his penchant for privatizing the armed forces so his mercenary corporation (otherwise spun by the Bush & Co. as "contractors") friends in Haliburton, KBR and Blackwater become wealthier, and you get an impression of how much he respects the under-paid, under-equipped and over-worked US soldier.     "Bush said a generation shaped by Vietnam "must remember the lessons of Vietnam." When America uses force in the world, "the cause must be just, the goal must be clear and the victory must be overwhelming," he added."    Bush hasn't learned anything from Vietnam, and has created a worse environment for our soldiers and country in not doing so.   "Americans live on the sunrise side of the mountain. The night is passing and we are ready for the day to come," Bush said.   The conservatives railed on Kerry's hopeful observations in his acceptance speech last week, yet he doesn't even come close to Bush, the King of Sound Bites.  And last, but definitely not least, the Hope diamond of unfilled campaign promises, given by VP Dick Cheney:   "He said that Bush will 'show us that national leaders can be true to their word.'"   Think about these promises Bush &amp; Cheney made back in 2000, and realize that they have not come through on any of them. What makes a person think it will change this go around? Bush has already started his Sound-Bite speech campaign, and I hope that voters will re-examine what the Bush campaign sold to them in the past, and what they infact received in the end.

John Kerry is not known as being a charismatic speaker, nor has he spoken to huge gatherings of people.  But he did both last night, and nailed it like a seasoned pro on the speaker circuit. His hour long speech covered such topics as his decorated war record, his call on restoring trust and accountability to the White House, and his proven ability to lead in a time of war, all of which current President George Bush fails at miserably.  The feeling that I kept experiencing was that of a Father telling his family that even though it will be a tough road ahead, we can overcome the current obstacles and reach that beacon of light that America once was before Bush extinguished it.  I had that same feeling with former President Clinton, a close human bond that is propelled by his soft, yet strong voice of reason and hope.  Overall I was very excited and motivated by the convention.  All of the speakers, spare one or two, were invigorating and thought-provoking, even when they had the same message.

The owner claimed his dog had rabies and was out of control. However, witnesses stated the dog was not demonstrating aggressive behavior, and that the owner vigorously and viciously beat it into unconsciousness. The animal died at the scene. The owner was arrested and booked on a charge of misdemeanor animal cruelty.     This is a good example of the inadequacy of Idaho's animal abuse laws. In 41 states the incident described above would be prosecuted as a felony. However, under our current laws, the maximum charge an offender can be cited is a misdemeanor. Our laws are antiquated and insufficient. It's time for the citizens of Idaho to ask our Legislature to re-evaluate, change and strengthen current animal cruelty legislation.  Research has determined a correlation between the mistreatment of animals and the mistreatment of human beings. Do we wait for offenders to escalate their harmful behavior and broaden their victims to include children or the elderly before serious intervention happens?   - Nancy Corgiat, President, Bannock Humane Society, Pocatello"  I whole heartedly agree!  Idaho's animal cruelty laws are way too lenient compared to other states, such as Maine, where a  urlLink current case  has received quite a bit of attention, and where the accused are being charged with a felony.

Physical beauty is only skin deep and is not a factor in how a woman represents our great nation, whereas her mind,  her core beliefs and her actions do.

The campaign is now trumpeting the fact that Kerry, after voting to authorize the use of force in Iraq, described himself "as an anti-war candidate."[1] The claim is based on a clip of Kerry's 1/6/04 appearance on Hardball with Chris Mathews, which is featured in a new 12 minute "documentary" on Kerry produced by the Republican National Committee. This is how the RNC presents the interview:[2]   MSNBC'S CHRIS MATTHEWS: "Are you one of the anti-war candidates?"  KERRY: "I am - Yeah."   The  real  transcript of the interview reveals that the clip was doctored. Kerry was not trying to shift his position but actually reiterating his belief that President Bush made a mistake in the way he went to war. Here is the actual transcript:[3]   MATTHEWS: Do you think you belong to that category of candidates who more or less are unhappy with this war, the way it's been fought...Are you one of the anti-war candidates?

I also thoroughly enjoyed the commentary by retired military officials in support of Kerry.  How can someone like Bush, who conveniently was able to slip out of serving in Vietnam, be a better Commander-in-Chief than a man who decided to fight for his country and became a war hero?  If you didn't catch Rev. Al Sharpton's speech, you really did miss out (but you can watch it by clicking on the  urlLink this link  and scroll down in the box).  Unlike other speakers at the convention, he actually confronted Bush on a number of topics, including the buyability of the black vote.

On the fourth attempt, Lee and another officer waited for a tranquilizer team to come to the scene, but when the tiger lunged toward the officers, Lee fired five rounds, according to the report. The cat was dead by the time the team arrived."  I feel for the tiger as much as the next animal rights supporter does, but I cannot blame this officer for putting the cat down if in fact it was charging them.

Sincerely,   Phillip F. von Bargen, LSW  Pocatello, ID

My only hope is that, one day soon, women -- who have all earned the right to their opinions -- instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed.'"  Although Heinz Kerry's speech was reserved, it gave me an impression of what an educated and worldly woman she is through her work protecting the environment and her philanthropic foundation.  This is the type of woman, much like Sen. Hillary Clinton was, that we need as First Lady.  Her unfailing dedication to speaking her mind and her ability to reach out to our international partners (she speaks five languages and is not a native born American), will be a more than welcomed addition to the White House in January.  I was deeply impressed by her speech, and cannot wait to see her take an active role in her husband's presidency.

       urlLink Idaho State Journal : (I learned of this case through a colleague.) This is an open letter and a request to readers for assistance, regarding the out-of-line sentencing of Cassie Jones.  ----------   Phillip F. von Bargen  Idaho Licensed Social Worker, #24848  Pocatello, Idaho  philvb@cableone.net   July 19, 2004   Governor Dirk Kempthorne  First Lady Patricia Kempthorne  Attorney General Lawrence Wasden  cc: CS Hunt - Managing Editor, Idaho State Journal  Brenda Baumgartner - News Director, KPVI Channel 6 News  Clayton Diggie - National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Southeast Idaho  Representative Donna Boe - Idaho House District 30  U.S. Representative Mike Simpson - US House of Representatives  U.S. Senator Larry Craig - US Senate  U.S. Senator Mike Crapo - US Senate   I am writing you in reference to the recent out-of-line and unjust sentencing of Cassie M. Jones on July 8, 2004, to 2-10 years, handed down by Fifth District Judge G. Richard Bevanof, for the crime of witness intimidation, and prosecuted by Deputy Attorneys General Ken Robins and Ken Stringfield.   This is a quote from a press release regarding the case, issued by the Idaho Attorney Generals Office on July 8, 2004:    "The charges arose from an incident in Fifth District Court in Twin Falls on June 2, 2003. Following sentencing of her husband on other charges, Jones struck and shouted at two witnesses in that case. Jones was taken into custody and later indicted by a Twin Falls County grand jury. Following a trial in April of 2004, a jury convicted her of two counts of witness intimidation."  (As you read this, please keep in mind that this was Mrs. Jones' first offense.) Cassie Jones suffers from Bi-Polar Disorder, and has had that diagnosis for a number of years. The use of prescription medication has been successful in decreasing the frequency of symptomatic episodes for her, but at the time of the crime that she was convicted of, she was seven months pregnant. Why this is important is because she was not allowed to take her medication in fear of harming her baby, along with the fact that she wanted to breast feed. This was her Doctor's order. Although counseling sessions during this time helped to a point, without her medication, the disorder impairs her ability to function in a consistent, rational pattern and therefore proves to be a disruptive influence in her life. The sentencing of her husband was a time of great stress, and only exacerbated the situation. I respectfully request that you examine the mitigating circumstances surrounding the incident, and reconsider the overly harsh and unjust sentence.   I have posted this letter on my blog {http://philvbblog.blogspot.com/} and openly requested reader assistance in contacting you to voice their objections.   Respectfully,  Phillip F. von Bargen, LSW   ----------  Write your own letter or copy and paste the one above (replacing my name, address with yours) into the form or e-mail.

However, respect for scientific inquiry has not been a hallmark of the Bush administration. A case in point: A Department of Health and Human Services order issued in April — but little noticed then — gives the administration tight control over which government scientists may sit on expert advisory panels of the World Health Organization."  Goes hand-in-hand with the US's practice of protecting fat-cat pharmaceutical firms patents by strong-arming developing countries to not use cheap generic forms of AIDS drugs.  Another example of how money is more important to Bush & Co. than human beings.

         urlLink Chicago Tribune : "And in North Carolina and Idaho, Planned Parenthood officials have expressed concern that the shirts will offend people in their communities and distract attention from the group's efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Rebecca Poedy, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Idaho, told her local CBS affiliate, KCBI Boise, that the shirts distract from the organization's efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies. 'Very disappointed,' she told KCBI. 'I think the issue to focus on here is the effort that Planned Parenthood goes to to prevent unwanted pregnancy. I think this is just a poor decision and we are just not supportive of it.'"  I totally agree, and am very happy that we have a independent thinker as executive director of the Planned Parenthood of Idaho.  By having the national head of Planned Parenthood extol the virtues of it does serious damage to an already embattled organization. Abortion is just one issue that they tackle, and yet by endorsing and selling this shirt, those that might be sympathetic to Planned Parenthood's cause, will be repelled because of it.  Let's face it, the religious right is never going to change their view on abortion. The population that we can attempt to reach are those middle-of-the-road people who don't have a strong opinion either way. But I can guarantee you that the use of this T-shirt is just going to push them over to the anti-abortion side of the fence. The only point of this shirt to further polarize the masses on the issue of abortion, which begs the obvious question. Why? Is it because the women that wear these shirts don't want those moderate types of people supporting their cause, and want this issue to be dominated only by extreme feminists? What other explanation for a shirt that will offend the very people we are trying to bring into the fold?   "Jennifer Baumgardner got the idea for the shirt while working on a documentary about the secrecy surrounding abortion. The film, tentatively titled "I Had an Abortion," is scheduled to be released Jan. 22, the 32nd anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion." Her "effort" here is nothing more than capitalism at it's worst, trying to promote her film without looking at the bigger picture. I think she's got dreams of being the next Michael Moore. Too bad she's already alienating everyone other than those in her own camp, extreme feminists and their supporters.

Overall personal income -- which includes wages, salaries and income from dividends, interest, rents, self-employment and other sources -- rose by 0.2 percent in June, the slowest monthly increase in more than a year, the Commerce Department reported.

       urlLink New York Times : The poster girl for the abuses at Abu Ghraib, Lynndie England, appeared in military court today.  Seems that the higher-ups in the military are trying to pin the abuse scandal on this woman and her other comrades who's photographs have been been seen by the world.  If you buy that explanation, that this was an isolated case and was the fault of just a handful of grunts, I've got some wonderful ocean-front property in Montana to sell you.

The official said the information suggests 'there is a new plan in the works.'  There are no details on possible methods of attack, and authorities are aware of no specific time frame."  Bush & Co. are feeling quite threatened by the Kerry/Edwards campaign, as evidenced by another "terrorist threat" meant to frighten American citizens into sticking close to our current commander-in-chief.  Ever notice that these terrorist threats suddenly surface when Bush's approval ratings tank?

Finally some progress on the rights of detainees at Guantanamo.  The ability to secretly jail those suspected of "terrorist acts" indefinitely, while offering no legal representation, is a perversion of our rights.  Not to mention that these "acts" or suspicions can be spun by the US government to cover just about anything.  This scares me more than the terrorists.

       urlLink LA Times : "In August 1998, however, Stroud noticed something strange: Lily Creek ran dry before its counterpart. 'It didn't add up,' he says. Stroud had heard rumors of someone selling local spring water to bottlers, and he wondered whether that might explain the anomaly. One day he clambered half a mile up the rocks. There, just above State Highway 243, he found what he took to be the answer: a pipe that emerged from the slope, split in two, and ran down to a pair of steel tanks by the roadside.  Stroud had stumbled upon the site of Idyllwild Mountain Spring Waterworks, Inc. The discovery would launch him and his neighbors into a continuing conflict. There have been blockades, vandalism, threats of violence. One combatant served time for battery. And Idyllwild is not unique. In rustic retreats across the country, the spring water wars are boiling over."  The next time you grab for a bottle of spring water from your local grocer or convenience store, think about how they acquire that water you're about to drink down.  It's one thing to share a water source with nature, it's another thing to rob it and leave a creek dry, which will greatly affect the natural wildlife that depends on it for survival.

       urlLink Washington Post : "The Vatican issued a letter Saturday attacking the 'distortions' and 'lethal effects' of feminism, which it defined as an effort to erase differences between men and women -- a goal, the statement said, that undermines the 'natural two-parent structure' of the family and makes 'homosexuality and heterosexuality virtually equivalent.' The sharp critique was contained in a document issued by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a chief adviser to Pope John Paul II and head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the department in charge of laying out Roman Catholic orthodoxy."  Ack, someone should have nipped this one before it went public.  How is the effort of promoting equal rights, equal pay, and equal voice in marriage for women, translate to being "Lethal" to the "natural two-parent structure?"  Feminism not only helps to create a more equal playing ground for both genders, but will assist in educating young men and boys on being respectful and open-minded adult men instead of male chauvinists.

How does this firm get away with this type of deliberate incompetency and deception? I'm a social worker, and to get paid, particularly with regards to Medicaid billing, you must have your records (progress notes, billing records, signatures, masses of paperwork) available for auditors from Health &amp; Welfare. Guess what happens if you make a habit of not doing it on time? Your contract to bill Medicaid is cancelled. I think Morgan Stanley is in desperate need of a good boot-to-the-head to straighten them out, fining them is obviously not an effective punishment.

Rising oil prices have become an issue in President Bush's reelection.  Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry has raised concern that U.S. dependence on oil from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, leaves the United States vulnerable. At last month's Democratic convention, Kerry drew sustained applause when he declared, "I want an America that relies on its ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi royal family."  Mere coincidence that the Saudi's attempt to lower oil prices comes at the same time Kerry is raising concerns about our dependence on foreign oil? I think not. Bush must have called his Arabian oil buddies to inform them of the threat John Kerry poses to his re-election campaign.

The independent presidential candidate has become embroiled in an ugly exchange with the Jewish organization, after he suggested that President Bush and Congress were 'puppets' of the Israeli government.  'The days when the chief Israeli puppeteer comes to the United States and meets with the puppet in the White House and then proceeds to Capitol Hill, where he meets with hundreds of other puppets, should be replaced,' Nader said earlier this summer. That prompted an angry letter from the league, which complained that the 'image of the Jewish state as a 'puppeteer,' controlling the powerful US Congress feeds into many age-old stereotypes which have no place in legitimate public discourse.'"  Nader is only half right. It's not the State of Israel who are the puppeteers, it's the fat-cat corporate types, the ultra-wealthy and the neo-cons who are pulling the strings. Either way, a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush, no matter how you cut it.

"Appearing with her husband, Cheney's wife, Lynne, also went after Kerry's comment to a minority journalists' convention last week that he could fight a 'more sensitive war on terror.' 'With all due respect to the senator, it just sounded so foolish,' she said. 'I can't imagine that al Qaeda will be impressed by sensitivity.' Lynne Cheney said Kerry's comment was an expression of an 'extreme left' idea that Americans bear responsibility for the terrorism threatening them. 'If we'll just adjust our attitude seems to be the idea,' she said. 'This is the kind of left-wing foolishness that certainly isn't appropriate for someone who would seek to be commander in chief.' She was responding to an audience question about Kerry's remarks last week to the Unity 2004 conference in which he said, 'I believe I can fight a more effective, more thoughtful, more strategic, more proactive, more sensitive war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side.'"  I love how the fat-cat republicans try to use this snippet of Kerry's quote in an effort to question his leadership abilities. If you read Kerry's entire statement, you get a completely different interpretation. The republicans can only use negative attacks as their administration has nothing they can boast positively about. The world is a much more dangerous place since Bush took office, our economy is in the crapper, we've lost over 8 million jobs, and the only population he has succeeded in helping are the top 1% in terms of wealth.

Specifically, according to the July 14, 1992 Washington Post, George W.

'They're really aimed at the children of seniors; they're selling to the caregivers. It's another way of taking away our independence.'  About a dozen of Ambrose's colleagues will be in a select contingent to hit the rails later this month to protest the Bush administration's prescription drug law in one of many examples of senior citizens' activism.  The 'Canadian Rx Express' is a train ride to Vancouver to pick up three-month supplies of prescription drugs to dramatize the irony of having to go to Canada to buy U.S.-made drugs at discount prices. The new law prohibits Medicare from negotiating bulk rates, so acquiring American drugs from Canada is significantly cheaper than buying them in America."  The cry for cheaper drugs from seniors to children is becoming deafening. The only hope we have of affordable drugs in our country is to either purchase them in Canada (which Bush &amp; Co. have made illegal), or boot Bush from office this November and replace that fat-cat corporate sell-out with a man who actually cares about the health of US citizens - John Kerry.

Foresters consulted with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which is generally friendly to oil, gas and timber interests. The consensus: Reject the request of natural gas producer El Paso Corp. to drill in the meadow.  Then, as Times staff writer Julie Cart reported Monday, came the White House Task Force on Energy Project Streamlining a title that tells the story. It nagged forestry officials to reconsider. Suddenly, the Forest Service came out with a report more favorable to the El Paso proposal, a first step in opening the forest to gas exploration."  Just one of many attacks on our national forests by Bush &amp; Co., who sell out our pristine wilds whenever they can turn a buck for their friends in the oil, mining and lumber industries. Bush will go down in history as the most steadfast enemy of our environment.

       urlLink LA Times : "Almost half of Medicare recipients dislike the new prescription drug law, and nearly 3 in 10 seniors and disabled persons say the issue will influence their vote for president, according to a national survey released Tuesday. The survey suggests that there are 'maybe a half-million seniors' who might swing their votes to Democratic candidate John F. Kerry and another '1 million to 2 million whose votes might be up for grabs on this issue,' said Drew E. Altman, president and chief executive of the private, nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation."  The GOP have long been able to count on the senior vote, but this election looks like it may be different. Soaring drug prices, impotent Medicare reform and legal blockage to purchasing cheaper drugs in Canada, all thanks to Bush &amp; Co., are now becoming the rallying cry for seniors to vote for John Kerry this election.

       urlLink LA Times : "Kerry pledged that as president, he would increase the national parks budget by $600 million over the next five years to pay for a backlog in maintenance. He said he would finance the increase with a portion of the revenues from a partial rollback of President Bush's tax cuts, by increasing the fees that private companies pay for mining public lands and possibly raising some park fees. He accused Bush of neglecting the national park system and essentially letting America's natural wonders go to seed."  Bush has done far worse than just improperly funding national parks...he's sold out our nations natural wonders and forests to his friends in the oil, mining and lumber industries. We at least have a fighting chance at correcting this if Kerry wins the election.

Less than two months after the invasion of Iraq, Bush flew to a U.S. aircraft carrier and declared an end to major combat with a banner proclaiming "Mission Accomplished" in the background. The event, Bush's words and the banner have been repeatedly criticized and mocked since that first day of May 2003. The Iraq occupation turned more violent, American deaths continued to mount and U.S. forces failed to find weapons of mass destruction, a main rationale for the war."  Wonder what Bush & Co. promised or paid Franks to take the fall?  If he was at fault, why didn't he come forward back in May of 2003, when this was all the rage in the press?  This is just too convenient, and smacks of history revisionism in an attempt to save Bush face in the upcoming election.

An advocacy group's effort to revoke Abbott's patent on Norvir died last week when the federal government refused to intervene. Legally, the government's decision made sense: Abbott isn't breaking any patent laws by quintupling Norvir's price. But to AIDS patients who don't give a rip about legal niceties, Abbott has some explaining to do."  Thanks to Bush &amp; Co., and their blanket support and protection of the pharmaceutical industry. Abbott may not be breaking any written law, but they are the poster-boys for highway robbery and crimes against humanity for their outrageous increase in price of a drug that is vital to HIV/AIDS patients. This is simple greed over human decency. The only way to have a shot at fighting this type of extortion is by voting for John Kerry in November.

Keyes acknowledged that he 'gave no remote thought of coming to Illinois until six days ago' and said he told state party officials last week that when it comes to switching states to run for office, 'as a matter of principle, I don't think it's a good idea.' "  He doesn't think it's a good idea, but he's still going to proceed? The GOP railed against Hillary Clinton for running for a Senate seat in NY, but remain quiet when they do worse. She at least lived in the state for a good period of time before the elections.
