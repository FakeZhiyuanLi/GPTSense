       Hay guys, whats up, not too much here, at the library since my stupid comp likes to fack up so much. Anyway, I'm about to go to Wally World, and hopefully the mall or best buy to get a couple CD's. Probably Brand New's old one, Matchbook Romance, and the Warped Tour compilation for 2004. I don't know, anyway, updates. Last night Furby got off the fone with me, either I fell asleep and didnt get his call, or he never called, but he said he would. Oh well. HmPh, I'm gonna call kitty and see what shes doing. Yah, I'm gonna do that, go look for a b/f I've made up my mind, I need to keep myself occupied instead of wishing for something that I know will NEVER happen. Might as well try to fill up the space I know only one person can fit into. Sad isn't it. Yah I know I'm pitiful, but thats ok, because I can admit it. Proudly.  gota go, gonna write an entry on em0-rampage       K@!

       Hey,  Sorry I haven't wrote in a while, I was grounded from the comp, and they took my fone away, which meant limited talking to Furby  =( Anyway, some things happened recently, I was scared out of my mind a couple days ago, of course by Furby. =| LoL. He was telling me some stuff, like he had a gun in the house, oh my gosh I was so freaking scared. I didn't kno what to do. But we're all better now, or at least I think we are. Gawd I hope we are! =S wellllllll, ain't got much to say, I wrote more in my main site, and I'm going to put a song on my other one.

        FuRbY!!!!! ::sigh:: Furby.... ::dreams::     I don't know if I should be feeling this way. This is how I felt when I first started dating Jesse. Jesse ended up being a not so good thing tho.   Ok, my insecurity about Furby is that he won't like me after he meets me in person. I also had a couple dreams, like he met Amanda, saw how beautiful she was, and then totally ditched me for her. I cried sooooo much. I've been crying recently and it REALLY sucks. This one song that I have really reminds me of him. New Found Glory "Story so Far" I can't listen to that song anymore without thinking of him and getting all choked up.                                       ::cry::           I know I know, I'm pathetic.  Really really pathetic.            I'm gonna end it here now.

       Hi,   My name is Christy aka Kat. I am 14, my birthday is August 22nd for all you people who might get me a great gift this year =D Anyway. This blog is supposed to be about my deepest secrets or dreams or whatever I decide to share with you. I don't know I might be putting insecurities too. I'll give you some updates right now though. I'm really in love with someone right now. His name is Brandon, but I call him Furby. (He got his nickname from a noise he makes that reminds me of a furby ^_^) He lives in California, which makes it really really difficult. I rele care for him. He's supposed to be coming up to KS in July. He's saved $100 so far, which I think is really great. I jus wish he lived closer. I'll write an entry about him later. Gonna end it here.                   K@!   urlLink   (This is my regular site, but this is for deep secrets, only a few will know about this site)

         Hay.... I guess blogspot has been changin their stuff! I like....uhm...well some of you (who don't even prolly read this site) don't know about what happened recently. I guess I got rele rele rele depressed over some stuff, and decided that I was goin to end it. I didn't..LoL..I wouldn't be writing this if I did, some ppl stopped me...David, Cory, Spug, Colin, and of course Furby. I guess he was the deciding factor, he doesn't know this, but if he hadn't showed that he cared I would've definitly went through with it. I was bound determined, but then Furby stopped me, I guess love is stronger than I thought it could be you know. I was promising myself that even if he tried to stop me I wouldn't listen, because this is what I wanted to do. I don't know, I guess things work out in weird ways eh. Well, now that you know, I think I've made a long enough entry, don't you? LoL.....Love everyone.    K@!
