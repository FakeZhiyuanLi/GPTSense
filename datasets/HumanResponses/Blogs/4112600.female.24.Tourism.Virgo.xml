      i finally got my apartment organized!!but still i cudn't hide all the debris he left behind.need to call a plumber to fix my kitchen sink,utility bills to pay,not forgetting the cable network too.must get them done by tomorrow,in other word i have to wake up early..**sigh** yunk came and pick me up from work and went down to hrc to collect JD's t-shirt.looked for shan,the waiter,only to find out that ejat had collect it earlier.text him saying that he'd better pass it to me or else....putus sahabat..(cewah,macam real sehh..) when ejat came in i asked him and he still beating around the bush saying that he didn't even noe wat's going on..well,dat my friend,really pissed me off...till i didn't even noe wat to do,standing there like a statue,stone cold,feel like a tight slap on my face cos i eventually dragged yunk along.we were actually there not to party but just to collect the shirt.the rest of the gang wud be wondering if i were to get our arse out of there without drinking.cold heartedly i gave yunk dat 'im- pissed-n-lets-go-back" look n we out of there..and endless ringing on my mobile thereafter,which i dont bother answering..i hate it wen ppl play me out just like kids.yunk cooled me down by being a joker and seriously i cant help myself but end up laughing out loud..he is one living creature who is always make me laugh. i had a great relief the moment we stepped in to a newly organized,polished floors apartment of mine.yunk decided to crash outside on the sofa bed.he made himself very comfortable with the quilt and i cant help myself but to slid next to him.i felt warm and safe whenever wherever im with him.i told him this the next morning and he dryly  reply 'well,it's easy..i dun haf to work la like dat'..**dogol**

      blogging is addictive..the last time i owned a diary when i was 12 or 13 years old.well obviously during that time i had nothing interesting going on in my life for i spent most of the time in the training field.what was with hockey and netball so on and so forth..it was not that easy when you had to play for your state. im driving again today and tonite wud be the last nite before i go on leave.yes sis,i'll be on leave for 7 sweet days..yunk promised to stick around for his current month's roster is suxx.well it looks just fine to me cos i get to be with him most of the time.loads of turnarounds and only london coming up sumwhere in the middle of the month.he definitely has to bear with me for the rest of the week.yunk,trust me,we have helluva things to do when there is only YOU and ME.. just another day before i get to be him again.he's touching down at 2130 and i'll pick him up from sentral at around 2230.but still has to wait for his call in case there is delay or aog or mab cudnt open the doors..worst still.. me and my team thinking of lepaking in hard rock tonite.what the heck,im not working tomorrow.they do..hehe..  ****yunk,hurry back.ure mine,remember?******

      aarggh...it was only 11am and yunk's mobile sent gothic music to my ears.His golfing kakis gave him a a wake up call and they'd be playing at KGSS today.Most of his kakis are 'ayam' in action.It is a term we use for new golfers and they often lost the balls at least 3 tubes each..(30 helluve balls once!)went back to sleep after he'd gone,woke up around 4pm and off to hotel.Shit waiting.. Gotta tell u dis.. my favourite place in the hotel is the KITCHEN..when ure hungry of course...cant remember wen was the last time i feed myself since me and yunk left the gig last nite..fired one mee mamak thru chef zamzam and i made my way up to the lounge.there weren't many guests around so i took my own sweet time checking the inventories,revenue recap so on and so forth...called yunk at the offfice and guess wat..he lost 10 bucks to a person i dont even know who..they bet during the game..it goes like one stroke, or one ball,in or lost and definitely i am lost now..can never figure dat out..  gotta go down now.the band wud start at 930pm and i haf to be around.
