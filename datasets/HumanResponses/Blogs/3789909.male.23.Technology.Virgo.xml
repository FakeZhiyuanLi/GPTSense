      Or so I am going to convince myself of this.  I highly doubt anyone will actually read this, and if you do, I must question why?  I mean, do you not have anything better to do than to surf around and read peoples thoughts that they put on the internet?    Of course, I must question why I am even doing this.  Let's just say it's an experiment.  An experiment in how long I actually post here, and what I post.  Don't expect me to come and lay all my sad, teary-eyed stories of failed loves and hardships in life.  I can never understand why people do that.  You are putting yourself up for an uncaring, unknown audience.  Heck, that's even worse than acting in a movie.  Someone could come up and tell you that you did a bad job in a movie, but any anonymous moron could say that your blog is a pile.    Ah well, enough ranting for now.

      Post number 3!  \/\/007!  I've been looking at others' blog and it still amazes me as to how they can post all their sad crap.  No one gives a damn!  You are  not  that important that someone want to read about how you cut yourself.  In fact, others are laughing at you behind their computer screens.    Ah well.  As long as I never meet one of these freaks.  I may explode into a violent fury and give them to really whine about.    Of course, I really can't say much.  I'm about to lay some stuff down myself.  I've been listening to a lot of Celtic influenced music lately.  Why I don't know.  Must be because I can't find anything else that sounds decent.    A new little thing I'm going to start doing.  Recommended reads.  Books and comics that I thing other may like and why they may.  Today's is  V for Vendetta , a comic written by Alan Moore and drawn by David Lloyd.  A very interesting comic set in a facsist England where a "hero" named V begins to cause trouble.  To say much more would be to ruin the story.  You can pick this up at most comic shops as a trade paperback.  Do so.  NOW!   Oh, the Rolling Stones still suck.  Just thought I would throw that out there.

      That blasted Rolling Stones song.  Well, okay, many of the Stones tunes grate on my ears, but this is that one from the new C2 commercials.  You can't get always get what you want.  No, really?  Why I never knew that, thank you Mick Jagger and Mumbles!  You have enlightented me!  I now see the light!  Idiots.  I never have liked the Stones.  They've always seemed like a Beatles ripoff.  Oh well.
