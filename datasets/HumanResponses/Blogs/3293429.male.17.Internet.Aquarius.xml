      Because I'm most likely not going to get a loan for a new Mac, I have borrowed an older used Mac from work.   urlLink You can see it here.   Yeah... funky isn't it? Check out the beastly specs on this bad boy... 367MHz PowerPC G3 Processor 320MB SD-RAM 4MB ATI RAGE Mobility 6GB Hard Drive Mac OS X 10.3.3 12" LCD @ 800x600 Resolution  I may buy it if it's offered cheap enough, just mostly to play around with, have at least SOME Mac for just the basics: music, browsing, chatting, etc...  I'll post an update tomorrow or sometime around there.

      So today I took a trip to Kennywood, a theme park in Pennsylvania, and along with my Sony Ericsson T616, took a few photos.  You can view all the pics I took by  urlLink Visiting my Moblog . Yeah, I'm still working on the template, I never finished it, so I'm working on a new one.

            On the left is the brand new 1.5GHz PowerBook G4 with SuperDrive. On the right is the Dual 1.8GHz PowerMac G5 with SuperDrive.  The PowerBook is $2499. The PowerMac is $2499.  The obvious choice here would be to go for the G5. On a power scale, the G5 would absolutely whip the G4 around like a red headed bastard step-child. On a personal level, I love portability. I love being able to take my work with me wherever and show it off, I love being able to work on things on the go, especially when I'm away from my house and there's nothing to do. On a financial level, they appear the same, but for the PowerMac, I have to buy a brand new monitor as I've sold all CRT monitors in my house, and the obvious choice would be the 17" Apple Studio Display because it is an Apple product and it uses Apple Technology, such as the Apple Display Connector, which allows for seamless operation between the two products, which is exactly what I love about using a Mac.  This now brings up completely new financial problems: The PowerBook is  still  $2499. The PowerMac is now  $3198 .  Which looks better now? And this doesn't even include sales tax, which is 7.5% here in Ohio.  So now you're probably like, "Why do you care, go for the G5 if you have the money!". Sadly, I don't have the money, which is why this is such a dilemma. I have to apply for a loan to pay for this. My credit is well, non-existant, I have nothing built up for credit and it's gonna be hard to get one through my parents also, since I am under 18. To get the PowerMac, I have to apply for a  $3000  loan. For the PowerBook, I only have to apply for a  $2100  loan (I have $700 that I earned from selling computer parts on eBay). Getting the $3000 could be hard, but the $2100 seems easier.   Based on these facts, and I probably have left a few out, what would you go with?  The PowerBook is a damn fine machine, but the last revision before PowerBook G5's come out (or so it is rumoured). The G5 is well, amazing, but also coming up on a speed and possible specification revision, which I can deal with, I started off on a 800MHz PowerMac G4 right when the new Mirrored Drive Door machines came out, and then downgraded to an iBook G3 700MHz for portability (which I told you I treasure dearly).  Ok, enough of this, comments are open to all Blogger users, anyone else can e-mail me (blingbling3k12 at comcast dot net), what do you guys have to say?

      If anyone's wondering, I used my blog for the basis on a new template I made for a  urlLink friend .  You may see this change from time to time as I make more, but my official blog is still at the URL in my last post.

       urlLink My work site...   Since Blogger doesn't like posting my posts (see the last post, which has NO content... thanks!) I decided it's time to do my own blog again, maybe...  But I started working on my corporate site, which you can preview at the above URL. Lets hope that I can get it to validate, although it's not THAT big of a deal, I guess it makes people think their penis is bigger than it really is or something.  Anyways... that's all for now.

      As stated in my  urlLink first post , I said I'd try to keep this thing updated. I was obviously talking out of my own ass. Regardless, I'm gonna try again to get this thing back up to speed.  So what's been going on?  Well... to continue from my last post, I did get a new Mac.  urlLink PowerBook G4 - 15 inch edition.  It's an awesome machine, I can't believe I doubted it before. Cost me a pretty penny though... well... about 280,000 pennies (do the math). For photos and more,  urlLink click here .  Anything else? Well, I also got a  urlLink car . 1996 Dodge Stratus. Does well, got a decent system in it, enough for my listening tastes. I hate hearing those idiots drive by with the subs so loud that their cars shake themselves apart, thus I have no subs in my car.  Besides that, went to  urlLink St. Louis  for the Fourth of July and saw the Cardinals beat the Seattle Mariners by a score of 2-1. Was pretty exciting, got one of those Gilligan's Island hats for free. Can't wait for the new ballpark to be completed, it looks amazing.  Anything else? Not really, still working, getting stuff done over there for a whole new web-based authoring system, no longer will we be forced to use FrontPage! Also picked up a potential client, going to meet sometime this week to see just what I'll be doing.  Oh yeah, my friend grabbed me a few Apple t-shirts from his trip to the Cupertino campus. I'll take pics of them as soon as I get them (and also pay him... even the t-shirts are expensive!).  Well that's enough for now, later.   Listening to:  Houston - I Like That  Buy it on iTunes!
