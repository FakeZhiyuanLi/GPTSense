       Well whats up guys?? These past few days have been fun. I went to work, and talked to Eric. Everything was awkward at first. Then that night I went to WoodHaven with natalie, and her brother, my ex, and we slept there and came home the next day. I got grounded bc i lied to my mom about where i was going to be. so it sucks b\c I didn't get to hang out with the guy I wanted to that night, his name is Mike and he's really starting to grow on me. The next day at work when i came in after drivers ed, the day after going to woodhaven, eric came up and gave me a hug....i was thinking to myslef...why is he doing this? and then he kept on like being where i was the whole rest of the day, which didnt bother me. I was so suprised, we were outside and he was pushin me on tha swing and he asked me what other rumors i had hurd about tha camp in and i didnt say ne thing bout him n kt, but he did, he told me tha story and how it wasnt ever gna happen with her. So then he was just all touchy feely with me, and we were down in tha basement, and I just wanted something to happen, but then again i didnt, b\c i know im not at all ready for that, especially when i like some1's else. I'm looking forward to being his friend first, b\c he's just this perfect guy, and michael was perfect and it didnt work out, so idk, hopefully my next one will....time will tell...i think i've said that before. Now i have a thing with daniel, he's one of my best guy friends, and i liked him for awhile, then me n michael started dating then daniel was talkin to this lil hoe, and i got super jealous... and forbidid them to talk, but they still did, who was i to say wheather or not they should, but i guess now they have stopped talking. and daniel comes running to me, i mean he has so many otha girls he talks to but he just has that thing where i could trust him and be with him no prblem, i think if we dated we wouldnt break up. it'd be like those yr long ones ya know...but yeah, i guess tonight we're starting over, he's one of my best friends, and it felt like i'd lost him there for a minute. and it scared me. so hopefully everythings going to be ok....till next time, im stephanie, n thas my confused lil world!!!! xoxoxoxo

       Hey. Today was a busey bad news day. I guess I'm not Katie. Katie is the gurl that Eric, the guy I liked from work's name. My friends at work said I should try to go for him. I got so excited. Then they called him to talk to him for me, and turns out he "dosn't date other girls" what kinda shit is that? I guess Im not katie. I was put in a bad mood instantly today when I herd this. gee thankx alot...My luck with guys lately....really sucks! My mood got a little better in the after noon for Driver's ed, there's this guy there that I'm sorta talking to. He is really cool, and we have alot in common, Natalie, him, his friend and I were supposed to go out mini-golfing tonight. We asked my ex boyfriend Michael to come. He thought we were sort of using him for a ride. When he broke up with me he said we would be friends, I thought that being his friend would be the best way to get close again or something...I don't know. Like I said before I still have a lil thing for him, I thought there for awhile he could have really been something good in my life. I was so happy. Today was NOT a happy day. I was really looking forward to hanging out with my new friend...(wink wink..lol j\k) I guess its going to happen another day is all. Natalie came over last night. It was fun! She looked like a movie star from the 80's. she tyied on a bunch of hats and sunglasses that I had...I gotta get those pix devloped! haha I'm so glad I met her n became friends when we first met I thought she was gonna kill me!lol then she said i was cool! yay!    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Im so nervous for Thursday, Eric comes back to work. What do I do? What do I say? I mean I think that I'll prbly start liking him the minute he walks in the door, but theres not alot I can do to avoid it. I mean I know I need to stop liking these 3 guys....I mean I feel bad, but its hard b\c 2 of them don't like me back. And the other one im not even sure on. So what will happen in this next "exciting" chapter in my life? Only time can tell...wow thats from a movie! I couldn't come up w\that. lol but no seriously. Hopefully my life will get more interesting. I just also wanna apologize to Katie(S) and Laura, for the way I was. I guess I was just mad at the whole Eric thing that day I talked to Katie. So I'm sorry for that guys, if u read this! xoxoxoxo to all! byee!!

        Ok, so I guess I'll start by introducing myslef..I'm Stephanie. I have my own little world some times, but maybe you guys out there reading would like to see what my head is like! lol. I have some very good friends I'd like to mention, b\c they know how I am, and how weird my world is at times, theres Spencer, my very best friend, lately my 2 other best friends have just been completely ignoring me, but I cannot forget my girl Natalie, even though I havn't known her forever, she's a great friend! (hey hun!) there is that guy just as close to me as possible, daniel, I can tell anything too.From work, the people that see me and know my personality the most,Sadie,Ebony,and Tobias. I can trust them with anything as well. So now that I've intorduced the main Characters in my lil world...I'll get started...     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today....hmm....I shocker....I had a great weekend, I'll give myself that, ha. I liked guy for awhile, since the day I met him actually. I met him at my job.Everyone else knew as well. I thought we were all pretty close at work and wouldn't hurt eachother.I guess we could call eachother&nbsp;a click!&nbsp;or is it clique? hmm... anyway&nbsp;an aquantince of mine sort of took this great guy with a personality away from me, knowing good and well my feelings of him. I'm not going to be upset about it b\c he's not the only one that I have problems with. My last boyfriend. 3 words....So-much-fun. I had great times with this guy. I mean I remember everything that we did since the day we met, we had a great couple weeks there on and off. I started to fall for this great guy, which of course made me worry, b\c no guy is ever perfect. People tried warning me of his flaws, but I thought maybe I can change it, maybe he'll like me and it will all be fine. liek the song says...."somethings gotta go wrong b\c im feelin way too damn good, n Its like evry time I turn around I fall in love with my heart faced down, and where it ends, is where it should..." I guess... I really didn't want that ever to end, though lately I've been fine, and I've been gettin over it ok, but every once in awhile I'll see something that'll remind me of him. My friends help me get through all those tough times, even though this shouldn't have been one considering he obviously didn't care, and it was only a little bit of time. Im very greatful for the people that are in my life. So now that My ex and I are over, I guess I have to start thinkin about other things.I went shopping. I love shopping. Its like Cher in Clueless.." I needed to find sanctuary in place where I could gather my thoughts and regain my strength...the mall...." haha maybe I'm not a shop-a-holic... On Friday night I went downtown with 2 of my "close friends" yeah...uh huh... it was fun, I saw Tobias, and Garett. I think you spell it like that... It was fun, some lady was handing out baggies of condomns to everyone, and hitting on Tobias. ha ha. That was prety much the highlight of my night. I felt bad b\c earlier that day a guy form my drivers ed class asked me to go to tha movies, I said I would, but I totally blew him off, I never do that. Thats not right, so people, take note....*dont blow people off* So I have to remeber to apologize. I can't get over the fact that a lot of shit keeps comin my way for no reason. I need to be happy again. I have to not give a shit about the stupid people that try to bring me down, and put my stress up! yeah, thats my plan. Today I went to Splash Country, and I saw one of my very few enemys, and she's a lifegaurd, and I was with my mom so not much I could do, so whatever, I guess I can say I went to the waterpark, and got some sun! lol that's always fun. My summer's been great. I've been having a blast. I've met some great new people, Im ready for my girl to get back from canada so I can have something to do! hahaha, well I'm going for now, this is alot of writing! byee
