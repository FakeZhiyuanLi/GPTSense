      I am back. Still experimenting with this. Still figuring out how it works, how I can edit, etc. I also looked at  urlLink Atom . I am excited about the possibilities. Anyway, I will start writing seriously after couple of days of experimenting with blogging. I also want to try playing with the template I use. I have no idea why I'd want to change something that's already nice. Just curiosity, I suppose.  Let me get to work!

      I am just starting to write down my random thoughts. This is my first post and I feel great. I will come back and write more stuff (more serious stuff :-)) later. Now I am logging off.

						   WOW! It's Friday already! It's amazing how fast life moves on. Yesterday I was chatting with my younger brother and he was reminding me of how short our lives are and we need to do whatever good we can before we disappear from earth. We are 17 months apart and he is my best friend undoubtedly. We both are very similar in thinking. In fact, that's one of the topics when our wives meet!!  Coming back to present, can you believe that I reached office at 8.30 this morning!!! I have decided to start early since anyway my younger daughter wakes me up at 7 in the morning ready for her morning milk! So, I have decided to come here immediately after dropping my daughter and go back for dinner time. Let us see how many days this will last.  Now I have finished catching up with folks back in Boston before they went to bed and ready to get on with another nice day. Will come back later.

						   I am back online after my wife and kids are asleep. Today was great. I got to office early and as planned got home at 7.00 in the evening. Unusually early. For me at least! I sat with kids when they ate. My 7 yr. old daughter is an avid reader. I haven't told you that, right? She reads like crazy. She is reading Harry Potter these days. For old-time sake, she wanted me to read to her before she went to bed. And I did. Great satisfaction. I read to her, kissed her good night, and went to eat with my wife.  Our younger one also loves books. May be it's because her older sister reads so much. We had kept all her books. When we ate, she hung around eating little bit from our plate and drinking more water. I had bought alphabet magnets for keeping on fridge. She has started recognizing few letters. Then I read her a book titled "First Words"! Then she kissed me good night and went to sleep with her mom. And I am back online.  What a wonderful day! I love my wife and kids, I call them my girls! I am in the thick of some tech experiments. Let me get back to it. May be I will come back here to scribble just before I go to bed.

						   Good morning. It's a beautiful morning in Bangalore. Last night it rained and it is nice and cool. I dropped my older daughter to the school bus stop and managed to spend 20 minutes with her. She is a chatterbox. I like it that way. I think kids who talk a lot get thru problems much easily and faster when they grow up. We will also (hopefully:-)) get to know what they are up to when they are in their teens just because they talk a lot.  After sending her to school, I was relaxing catching up with news. Since I was awake till 1.30 or so, I had no particular plans to hurry to office early. But, my friend wanted to try car pooling and I am at office by 9!! This hopefully means I will be out of this place to spend dinner time with my wife and kids on time. I always get back to work after they all sleep at 10 or 10.30 at night.  I am looking forward to another great day! Lots of interesting work.

						   Today I was able to reach before my older daughter went to bed. Traffic at that time is so bad in Bangalore, it takes more time every day. And as predicted, it has started to rain. And all roads of Bangalore starts getting blocked. We also had some visitors before dinner. So, my wife and I ate late. And our second daughter was up till 10.30 before she slept. Otherwise she goes to bed at 9.45 or so. She is just about 2 now.  Now that all at home are asleep, I am back online. I am sitting in front of the TV connected via WiFi and TV is playing some junk Chinese martial arts movie. Anyway, TV is just to create some noise. Otherwise it is too boring. I wonder who watches all these movies seriously!

						   This year we are expected to get great monsoon rains. Good for farmers in India. And it's surely nice to sit inside the house and watch the rain. But, if you have to get out in Bangalore, you are going to experience hell. We have the worst drainage system. Last week, a teenager fell inside and got killed. How terrible! This evening it is expected to rain. We will see...

						   I just created this blog. Don't know why! I already blog my  urlLink thoughts . Well, kind of! I thought may be it is a good idea to keep my random theories from my daily news. May be I am just confused about organizing all these. Anyway, let me try. May be I will bring all these together or may be I will link these together as needed.
