      No not that one.  Whiskers is 17 years old now. She's soft and cuddly and is probably a great great great great great great great grandma. But she doesn't look it. She keeps me warm at night and wakes me up when I don't shut off my alarm by raming her face into mine.  My favorite thing about her is that she follows me everywhere in the house. And I mean everywhere. She even pokes her head over the tub as if to check on me. She waits patiently by my feet in the computer room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and then when I take off she tags along. She's always by my side.  We eat breakfast together. Her favorite is toast. Especially with peanut butter, but how can you not love toast and p.b? I like the time we share in the mornings. It's important for our relationship.  When I'm away from her, my mom puts her up to the phone and I talk to her. She instantly purrs when she hears my voice which makes me purr too.  I love my kitty cat. She's my best friend, my companion and yes, even my soul mate. I'd run into a burning building to save her cause I know she'd do the same for me.....if she could carry me.

      I've been seeing a lot of commercials for this clean sweep show and it got me motivated to do my own clean sweep. I've got 27 years of crap in a 9x10 room. So I'm gonna junk it out and I think have a garage sale next saturday at my parent's house. Maybe I'll make enough to go back to the spa again!

      It is pouring out here!!!!I can't believe how quickly is went black and turned miserable. I hope there's lightening!!!I guess it's good that we have rain, make all of the fires go away, or at least help. I was getting sick of the heat. It made my vertigo worse I think.  Yeah, I have vertigo. I have no idea how. Werid. And did you know there are pills for it? I guess I shouldn't be that surprised. They have pills for everything. Do you breathe? Here's a pill to help you out! It's sick.  I got rid of another shift at Dairy Queen. So now my last day is thursday. Provided I show up! No I will. I want my pay cheque. And people keep mumbling this crap about burning your bridges....blah blah frickin' blah. People at work say they're going to miss me, but I highly doubt it. After a couple of days they won't even remember me. Which is fine, cause I sure as shit ain't going to remember them. I start my new job on the 13th of September so I'm going to relax for awhile. I had a foot and back massage yesterday and am getting a pedicure and eyebrow wax on friday. YIPEE! I can't wait to have cute toes. I have to endorse Undine's Retreat. It's a great little spa in Chilliwack on Airport Road. Not only are the prices extremely reasonable, but the staff is so friendly and nice and you get 15% off on tuesdays and your birthday month and each month has a special! I LOVE IT!

      Dear Ursy,         I miss you. My life is so empty and meaningless without you. Please come home soon. I need you......*sigh*              Your Dani Wani

      Only one week and two days until the job at the ol'DQ comes to an end, one may even say the end or an era. Can 11 years be an era? I am so god damned happy to be done there. I spent so much of myself in that sweatshop and have been through so much, high school, college, boyfriends, friends...and now I am moving on to a career. I am elated. When Jordy and I found out that I got teh job at Enterprise, that day we started looking at homes to buy. I feel like a grown up, and it's nice for a change. It's nice to think I don't have to live pay cheque to pay cheque anymore, it's nice not to worry if I'll have enough to pay the bills and it's nice to know that I can do things for my family and friends. I have gone to college for 9 years straight, 23 years altogether. Since I was a little girl all I wanted to be was an adult, on my own. And now, I get to have that. Really, this is freedom to me. I know I'll probably end up hating my job in about a year or two, but at least I have the luxury to hate a job with benefits. That's a good kinda hate, if you ask me. I have waited for this moment all of my life and I am the most excited person in the world. I feel like it's the beginning of the rest of my life.  As for DQ? I just want tha mother fucker to burn. Burn it DOWN!

      I laugh whenever I see those t-shirts that have the DQ logo but say drama queen instead. Cause that's what working at the ol'DQ is like....DRAMA! Everyone has got to gossip about everyone and who your ally(?) is one day will most likely be your enemy the next. It's so frusterating but what's the good news? That I got the job at Enterprise...well....unofficially. Sarah called me last night to say that her friend Jacqueline(who works there) found out that I got hired. This makes me very happy. Now I can finally start having a career! When I called my sweetie and told him the good news, we started seriously talking about buying a home. So I am happy. Now I just don't know if I'm gonna be good at it or not, but I'll sure try.

      I will be the first to admit that I am the biggest critic of my family. I harrass them. They annoy me and sometimes (okay OFTEN) we yell. But after today, I have gained a lot more respect for them.  EVERYBODY on my family side helped out with the engagemnet party in some way. Many offered, some were declined and others were put to work. And they all did it with smiles upon their faces. They were happy to do it, and we appreciated it. It's just called manners in my family. You are a guest at someone's house, the least you can do is offer to help out.  The Barnes did not. Nobody offered, except to eat and talk amongst themselves. I'm even insulted that Jordy, who I thought had some manners, didn't offer.  This makes me gain a lot more respect for my family and dare I even say, Pride. I saw them in a different light. They were open, welcoming, curious and happy to be there kind of people. The others were closed, quiet and almost seemed not interested in being there. However at the end they said they had a good time. I was like, HOW?! Perhaps with each other. This made me lose some respect for them.  I think that in the barely month that I have been in Surrey and co-habitating with The Others, I am already sick of them. And I'm hardly there. They walk around "my suite" with their shoes on, leave theirr garbage lying around my things, use my things and generally annoy the crap out of me with their "here's what I think you should do even though you never asked me" advice. If and when I get a job down there and am more permanent, I think some things are going to change.  Gotta love the in-laws.

      Whew! Everyone has left and we've just finished cleaning the house. Today was Jordy and mine engagment party and it was lots of fun! Lots of people came and unfortunatly we had one no show. I'm unsure of what happened to Arlene. She totally said she was gonna come and then never did. I'm just hoping she's not lying in a ditch somewhere. I'm going to send her telepathetic messages to call me...... cccccccaaaaaaalllllllllllll mmmmmmmeeeeeeee .....anyway...  The food was so good. I'm still munching away. I kinda wished there was more mingly between families...it was kinda like westside story; The Carey's vs the Barnes. Although I must admit I was a bit disappointed that there was no singing and dancing. OR finger snapping..oh well.  It's funny to see how our families differ. Especially since we both have a lot of the same values, such as as the importance of family, and being good people, ect. But we show it differently. My family is more open and tries to make an effort in getting to know others and making them feel welcome. Jordy's family is very friendly but keeps more to themselves. Maybe we should've played games.  Oh well. The joining of two families is definatley different. It's an interesting experience. I would like to now apoligize to my future kids for the crazy families that I am bringing them into. Mommy is sorry.  I would also like to mention the great work by my maid of honour, Ursula. She totally helped out and worked her butt off to help my mom, and I as well as my mother, totally appreciate it. It was this hard work and dedication that made me choose her as my maid of honour. URSULA...YOU ROCK!

      My eye won't stop twitching. And I think me thinking about my eye twitch makes it twitch more.  So Ursula came over yesterday (YEAH) and pointed out that my P.O.C car has a flat tire (BOO). I just  got  new tires. I need to get a new car!!!! Come on Enterprise. I should find out by the end of next week whether I got the job or not. And I found out yesterday that I got the job at Pier 1. Which is awesome. But I would feel bad taking the job at Pier 1 and not saying anything about the other jobs. So I told her I'd give her my final decision on Friday. SHe didn't sound exactly PLEASED about it, but what are you going to do?  I would also like to note that I am very excited to see my friend Arlene today. I haven't seen her in a month!!!! YEAH FRIENDS!

      I'm lying in bed and my brain will not turn off. It's gotta think about the interview, then it's gotta think about Pier 1, then DQ, then the fact that I didn't fit into the size 16 jeans(I think they had the wrong tag), and then it goes on and on and on and on and it's ANNOYING and making me whiney.Will I ever have a restful night's sleep?  I found a silver fish in our walk in closet tonight. Ew gross. I hate living there. That place feels so dirty and I can't control it. How do people live like this?!  It's nice to be back in Hope for the simple fact that I get the whole bed to myself (except for a pesky kitty) and this place is so CLEAN!!! Yeah for having an OCD mom.  I think I'm gonna take some drugs. Or at least contemplate it. Maybe that will put me to sleep.

      I heart you Olive Garden. Even more, I heart you chocolate mint candies that you get with your bill at Olive Garden. And I especially heart my sweetie who gave me half of his chocolate mint candies. I feel like I could explode from all the pasta that is in my weak belly but I am still in my happy place.  I think Jordy and I should shuck the whole wedding thing and buying a house thing and put all of our money together and buy an Olive Garden. BC SOOOOOO needs another one. Then I can get married there. OH! And have my reception there! HEY! I wonder if I can con Jordy into it? Maybe with lots o'sex. That usually works.....oh hell who am I kidding? That ALWAYS works.

      I don't know if I was too confident or if it was the dude interviewing me, but I sure don't feel as though it went well today. Today was my third and final interview for Enterprise, and I REALLY want this job because it pays damn well. The interview lasted all but 10 minutes and the dude was rapid firing questions at me and acting as though he was too busy to hear my answers. So I'm going to prentend I'm from Egypt and live in DENIAL and say it was all the interviewer's fault. SO THERE! I just don't feel very confident now.  The brighter side? My interview at Pier 1 kicked ass. At least I think it did. I was friendly, super confident, and the manager LOVED ME...but really, how could you not? I should find out about that job next week.  How depressing is it that I've gone to school for 9 years, have earned TWO bachelor of arts degrees and am getting sad that minimum wage jobs are turning me down. Maybe I should go back to school.........? Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Maybe I need to get me a sugar daddy on the side.

      Who are these people who drive in the left hand land and do the speed limit? Not only that, but WHY do you do it? You people drive me nuts!!!!! There is no traffic in the right hand lane, you're going maybe 5 clicks over the speed limit and you think you've earned the right to make a home in the left hand lane? I'm doing 120 km/hr and I still stay in the right hand lane. Referring back to an earlier blog, it's common courtesy, people! WHat is it that makes you do this? Laziness? Not paying attention? One thing that I have learned in my 11 years of driving and commuting is that no matter what speed you are going, there will ALWAYS be someone driving faster than you. SO MOVE YER ASS OVER!!!! Not only that, but this left hand lane hoggers also cause a lot of the traffic problems such as congestion. You're not allowing for flow. The faster people get stuck behind you while you stay constant with the right hand laners. You're not passing, therefore causing traffic jams and the sort. STOP IT! If you see that someone is coming up behind you and is going faster, please move over. Allow us to pass.  That is all.

      I saw the notebook last night and cried so hard. It was sweet. It was SUCH a chick flick but a damn good one. I would give Jordy sex for watching that one with me. It was kinda sad too, in the end, but I don't want to say anything and ruin it. I just hope that Jordy and I end up like that...*sigh*  I went and saw the restuarant where I will be having my reception at Minter Gardens and it is BEAUtiful. It has a patio and air conditioning and a separte room for dancing and it is AWESOME! So I just have to go put the down payment on it. I still can't believe I'm getting married. I feel like I'm doing all this work for a friend or something.  My wedding day will be like a sappy chick flick......BRING TISSUES!

      I am convinced that when people become customers they lose their common sense. Why is that? Why do people become so dumb? Why would you ask me what I put in blizzards to make it so chocolatey? Um....chocolate? How 'bout that, einstein. Why would people tell me that their order is to go in the drive thru? Why? WHY?! Why do you allow yourselves to be so dumb? Please, I beg of you, THINK before you speak! Before you have a hissy fit that you don't have any ketchup, please look on your tray first. I bet cha that's where it'll be. And whatever you do, for the love of god and all things that are holy, DO NOT insult the people who are making your food. Are seriously (sorry Urs) RETARDED???????!!!!! You call me stupid, slow and yell at me then expect me to make your blizzard minus the spit and doggy biscuts.....uh, yeah. I don't really think I am asking for much here. ALL that I want is for people to think before they speak. It's not world peace, I know that if we work together, not only as a community but as a nation, we can end stupidity. After that, we can take on the Americans.

      Why is it when you're looking for a job there are none but when you finally get one interview....you gets TONNES! What's up with that? I'm not complaining mind you. I just think it's funny.  So my interview went well today. I'm not sure if I can say the name....but I think it went great. I feel really comfortable with all of my answers...YEAH! And the people there seem so nice. I really hope I get the job cause it pays so well and the benefits are really good too. *Sigh* I need a job so I can buy things....like a house where I control the washing machine...for example.  Then when I got home I got a call from Pier 1 Imports. Which is cool too, but the pay isn't as nice. But who knows.....so I have an interview this wednesday. Keep your fingers crossed....

      What the hell ever happened to common courtesy? That's what I would like to know! Picture this: you're washing clothes, nothing fancy or super dirty, just common items such as shorts, underwear, socks, p.j's. The load of wash is finished. Yeah, you think, you're half way through your chore when all of a sudden you realize that your semi brand new white top has BLACK MARKS ALL OVER IT! At first you think, what did I do to my shirt? Did I slop something on it or rub up against something to make these marks? You get angry at yourself for being so careless. Then you pull out another item and it has the same black marks. Then another, then another. Your mind is going crazy trying to comprehend the oddness of this situation when at the bottom of the washing machine is BLACK MARKS on the tub!!!!!! Some idiot put in a super dirty wash and did not clean off the tub properly. I am super PISSED! These are my clothes!!!! That I paid for!!!! I barely have any money or clothes! Do I make this person reimburse me if the black marks fail to go away? And really what kind of a fuss can a person give when it's not even your house anyway. BUT IT'S STILL SO RUDE!  I mourn for you white shirt.....I hope that you are not in too much pain.
