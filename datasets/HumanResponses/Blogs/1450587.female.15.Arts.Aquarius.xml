      Poem: This Twisted World  All is wrong in the world, Circles are straight and lines are swirled, Lately everything has gone wrong, No one can play a tune or sing a song, I know humans are not perfect, But now you don't need a cause to get an effect, Things s go awry, And for no reason people start to cry, This world is so twisted, If it does not stop spinning, I will have missed it, I do not want to live, Yet, I do not want to die, I wish there was a special place, Where everywhere was HOME base, Where no one could score you out, Where everyone could be trusted and not left with doubt, Where no one could mar your careless life, And there was no such thing as a gun or a knife, But still, I have to wonder, Could you stand to live a life free of blunder?

      Poem: Losing Sight   I have lost sight,  I just cannot write, I cannot seem to rhyme,  And all I can think of is time and climb, They really never fit my affair, And every time I try, it sounds bare, I cannot think of bigger words, I cannot even think of a rhyme for words, By poetry needs serious help, It sounds like a dead dog trying to yelp, The end is near, So, have no fear, I wont make you bare much more, I really am interesting, Just my poetry is a bore, But this is the end, I wont make you stand anymore.

      Poem: I Cant, I Just Cant  I feel like my lips are sewn shut, I feel that little feeling in my gut, I know I should say something, But I cant, I just cant,  I would say it to myself in my head, And yet it still didn’t fit, Love is a word abused by its meaning, I want to say something to express my feelings, But I cant, I just cant,  So young and so many years to live, A person can only truly love once in a lifetime, I wish there was a word for my feelings, It is not exactly love… but it’s much more than like, I wish I could say something, But I cant, I just cant,  He makes my eyes light up, He makes my smile brighten, And my mood cheer up, He makes me laugh and cry, I wish I could say something… But I am so shy… So, I cant, I just cant,  But I will…  Because once something like this comes, You never want to lose it.

      Poem: Another Day  Today soldiers may die, And tomorrow families will cry. War has started, Far from done. The moon has set,  And so has the sun. The laughter is gone, The music is dead, And the streets of Iraq run blood red. It is nearing May,  And so many things have happened since yesterday. The time is of a new age, And the words of my mind run page to page, The war is of every thought, Along with all the soldiers that have fought. Fortune has always had a clever way, But since the war, Those little fortune cookies have had nothing to say. I have to sit, and take a thought, can lives truly be bought?' Past and future comes to end And minds must try to twist and bend, So not to think of the blood and gore, That has come from this terrible war.

      Poem: The Game of Life  To me, life has no beginning and no end. When does the future start? And when does the past end? Life is on-going feeling, And when you die the corners start sealing. Everyone wonders where you go when you’re dead, Do you go to the clouds?  Or Earth’s flowerbed? No one knows,  Because when you pass away, You never get to say what you wanted to say. Not many people ponder death, They don't really think about caskets, Or having no breath. Everyone gets a certain amount of time, So if you don't start now you'll get behind. One day your quest will be over, and all obstacles will fall, Hopefully you will have climbed that mountain and defeated that wall.  And the one day you think that everything once broken had been mend, That day will come short, for that is the day The Game of Life will end.

      Poem: Its All Over Now  The birds still sing, and the bells still ding,  but something feels wrong.  The trees still grow,  and the lights still glow, but something still feels wrong.  Its all over now,  I have figured it out, what all these feelings are about, something IS wrong.  You are not here, by my side,  my love still grows, but yours has died. Its all over now,  you left me, when I loved you, I felt that something was wrong,  But you KNEW.   The hate and anger took over and won. Before anything had started, it was all done.  It took a spit second for the gun to go... POW! But the thoughts will last a lifetime, Because Its all over now.

      Poem: Go Away  You don't even know me,  You think you do, but you don't No one does, Not even me, So go away.  Don't judge me until you know me,  So basically, never judge me,  Because you never will know me,  Because not even I do,  So go away.  I don't know why you think I care,  Because I don't, So don't bother talking,  Because I just don't care,  No one does,  So go away.  You think you are my friend, You're not,  No one is,  Not even me, So go away.   Just go away,  Because I hate you, Why wont you just leave me alone? GO AWAY!!

      Poem: A Lover's Fool  Every day I love you, And not one day passes by, When I don't ask myself "why?" You think you are so cool, And you can act like such a fool. Yet, day after day, night after night,  I wonder why I love you, with all my might, Sometimes you do annoy me,  An my friends just don't see, I see in you the best, Everything that I don't see in the rest, Some people are so blind, They just don't see you as sweet or kind,  But I do, and I always will, Your touch chills, and your eyes could kill.  But you think you are so cool,  And sometimes you can be such a fool.  They all say "Yeah, I guess he's pretty cool" But to me, you are just a Lover's Fool.

      Poem: So Confused  I am so far beyond confused, I am scared of loosing you. I want to tell you, but I remember the last time I tried. You hurt me so bad, I almost cried. But I don't know how much longer I can lie. If I don't say something soon, I may just die.  I cant think of anything but you, I am so confused,  I don't know what to do. I cant talk to anyone about it,  They just try to remind me of the last time we had a go at it.  Since then I am not even sure about you, I cant tell anymore, whether what you tell me is false or true. Someone please help me. I am so confused!

      This poem is dedicated to my BEST friend Chelsea...  Poem: My Guardian Angel  You are my guardian angel And we have been through it all Together through the big And through the small You never left my side And when the waves were big You helped me through the tide You are my anchor in tough storms And my guide through fields of thorns You are my lighthouse on a foggy morning That beacon of light that never stops shining You are my one sign of hope And when things go wrong You are always there to help me cope You are the rose in a field of daisies And the fire in the midnight sky Best friends until the day we die Its you and me, me and you And through it all The big and the small You are my guardian angel

      Poem: Dying  I try to take a breath I hear the word… “Death” My face turns blue My last words of life are due I cannot scream I cannot cry My pain is so severe As I lie, suffocating here My eyes are open I cannot see All I hear Is you yelling at me “You are no better than I” But as you are about to kill I am about to die

      Poem: When?  When will the torture end? When will my cuts mend? When will the agony be gone? When will I see the dawn? When will the pain cease? When will this hell They call life decease 	And my life end And my soul be forever rid of this place  Poem: Why?  Why does everyone leave? Why do lovers deceive? Why do we have to die? Why do we always lie? Why do I always bleed? Why do we have need? Why do we always shut the door? Why don’t we cry anymore? Why don’t I see the light? Why don’t you try with all your might? Why am I falling into this forsaken hole? What has happened with my soul?

      Poem: Suicide  Just one slice of the throat,  Blood splatters all over the note, Sooner or later you will be found no longer alive, In this world you could no longer survive,  Death is just but a taste,  Now consumed your life’s a waist,  Broken dreams can’t be replaced,  Your soul is gone without a trace, Never again to see the earth, Ashes displayed above the hearth, Why, oh why? Must you have the need to die?

      Poem: No Forgiveness  I'm sorry  That you said those things to me I'm sorry  That I wouldn't "leave you be" I'm sorry  That you want to "enjoy your youth" I'm sorry  That you didn't want to tell me the truth I'm sorry That I didn't matter to you I'm sorry  That you wanted someone new I'm sorry  That I saw you kissing her I'm sorry  That I don't want to be friends like we were I'm also sorry  That I hate you.. Because I always will No Forgiveness  ** This poem was a semi-finalist in a Poetry.com contest and will be published and copyrighted in this years poetry book from Poetry.com **

      Poem: Fucked Up  Recurring dream of my life As I want it to be My overprotective mother  Wont let me be me. To Wake up in a pool of pain And to get hit so hard with rain From the tears of being stuck In this prison of bad luck. Not being able to live your life Being stabbed in the back with a knife.  People's cruel words clouding my mind I never know who  Will be on my side. I'm slowly exploding Their words are so corroding. This life I'm living isn't mine And I don't have enough time To keep taking their shit!
