      Just a quick note. I read Rep. Jim Mcdermotts speah to congress on July 13, 2004. It states that while Dick Cheney was C.E.O. "Two of Halliburton's Subsidiaries sold millions of dollars worth of oils services and parts to Saddam Hussein's Iraq regime. " It also made clear that while Iraq, Libya, and Iran were under severe sanctions, Halliburton had dealings with all three countries. I found that odd because Dick Cheney campaigned in 2000 by saying " I had a firm policy that we wouldn't do anything in Iraq, Even arrangements that were supposedly legal." If anyone would like more info on the Congressional findings let me know via comment.

      I stayed up this morn to watch Martha get sentenced. She got 5 months in prison and five months in home detension. From what I gather she recieved very leanint rules for her in home. Last I heard in home was supposed to be a form of punishment much like jail time. It's supposed to save taxpayer money from being spent on incarceration fees. My brother is on in home and he is not allowed to leave except to go to work. While I agree her sentence is fair I question wether or not she should be allowed to only have to spend a total of 1 day a week in her home. This doesn't seem to fair to me. But then what do I know. I only witness victims of crime everyday. While I'm not saying lying under oath is as grave as murder I wonder If Jon Doe would recieve the same kind of treatment if he didnt have millions to hire. the most prominnet attorneys for the same charges. I cant wait to hear everyone elses opinion on the sentence. Well I gotta go I have to be at work in 8 hrs and havent been to sleep yet.

      I just occured to me that children including myself are requierd to get immunization shots . Why did they not give me my Hep. B. shot I have to have for my E.M.T. class. Why do something like 70% of the countrys in the world provide free medical care yet the U.S.A. doesn't. Aren't we supposed to be world leaders in medical and economic development. My tax dollar gets spent on funding medical research in which the mouse gets his shots free yet I have to pay more out of pocket for mine. Does anyone else see this as problematic? In my home town we are spending like a million dollars on a new skatepark. Don't get me wrong I myself used to skateboard and I agree kids need a safe place to skate. But its sad that the womens shelter is underfunded yet we have a mil. to build our 17th park in my city.Viva Che.

      So today I find out I have to get my Hepatitis B Vaccine among other things. So I call my doc to set up appointment and get informed that I must goto County Health Dept to get Vaccine. Lucky me my Insurence wont pay for it. I inquire as to how much of my well paid taxes to the county will pay for. I am told none. So I must purchase Vaccine myself then pay an extra heft sum to County Nurse to inject me w/ a series of three shots. Ohh lucky day. Yestery day I won $16 on a $1 lottery ticket. I go to redeem it and the clerk tears it up and says "Yoy won a dollar hun" I ask if she looked at ticket and she says"It says you won a dollar" of course she wasnt about to dig thru trash to prove ME right. Wow what an exciting start of the week.

      Wow I have a blog.Up untill 2 months ago I had never heard of a blog.haha. Well your prob. wondering who I am .Well here goes a brief summery of me.My name is Jason and I'm 24 yrs. old. 2 yrs ago I worked as a bartender when a new employee named Jon told me was an E.M.T. Wow I thought would be a fun(ha ha) job to have. Jon was a volunteer w/ the a local rural ambulance services and got me to go on a call w/ him. I was hooked. A few months later I was a driver for the vol. service.My first call went something like this...Picture Jason standing In a old firehouse in B.F.E.. John says"Well It's kinda slow today I'm gonna run into town to check in @ the Hospital to see what___ is upto. You'll be fine I'm sure." Now right before Jon leaves we here"Beep Beep Beep.___E.M.S. please be advised of possible 1050 P.I. at 800 S. and U.S.31"The former bieng a car wreck w/ personal injury on a major U.S. Highway. As we prepare dispatch comes back on radio and says something like false alarm. That god I think I'm nowhere near ready to do a call yet. So off Jo goes to the hosp saying it'll be fine as he leaves. 2 Min later I here"E.M.S. please respond to 1076 P.I. at 800S. and U.S. 31 .Ohh no! Jon just left! Imediatlly I jump Into gear and fireup the van. As I proceed to pick up my medic on the way I dget on the highway in about 2 mins. flat. As i proceed to 850 I see police sitting at the intersection of 850S and 31. Hum I think must be a traffic violation no car wreck spotted.. I drive immediatley to 800. Nothing here! Oh no I'm so in deep shit. I turn around and go back to 850. Needless to say iit was the site. After explain to the Stte Trooper why I drove by I inquired into the state of the call. Apparently a teenager blew a tire and neede to be driven to hosp. so his parents could pick him up. We drove him and all went well. To think this is the life I picked to pursue.. More bio. of me next post.
