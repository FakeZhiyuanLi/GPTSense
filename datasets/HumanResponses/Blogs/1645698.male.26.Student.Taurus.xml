      fourthling (11:06:39 PM): You've gone monosyllabic Tevren7891 (11:06:44 PM): ?? fourthling (11:06:51 PM): Quiet fourthling (11:06:57 PM): One word response sorta stuff Tevren7891 (11:07:00 PM): but but but fourthling (11:07:05 PM): Lol!!! fourthling (11:07:06 PM): Very cute Tevren7891 (11:07:07 PM): heh i said but Tevren7891 (11:07:17 PM): heh heh but fourthling (11:07:32 PM): Lol - mommy!  he said "but"!!!  Heh. A little peek into my daily life. In case you were wondering I am Tevren7891, and I said "but"+t. Ha, I crack myself up but not. Anyway meeting up some people and watching movies, probably Braveheart, Shari's favorite. Today was fine expect that I saw a damn Hummer again. It caused me to be blind for three seconds. Also the world is now collapsing if you haven't noticed. Was walking Jaun's dog with him when I noticed that a homeless man had nice leather cushions. Man, a homeless guy with leather cushions! Tired to get the dog to piss on the cushions but it wouldn't. Then tried to make it piss on a really nice car, but again it wouldn't. Life Sucks real bad since that dog didn't piss on the hot car (not Hummer, yet I can dream).

      Well, I'm an idiot!  But a reasonably happy one, nonetheless.  I figured out why the AP people never sent me my scores . . . I filled out the address thing wrong.  Can you believe that?!  How *much* intelligence does it take to bubble something in properly???  I don't even want to know what I got anymore - if I can't write my own name and address, I certainly can't pass the stupid test.  Unfortunately, now that I've decided I really *am* just that stupid, they've gotten my actual address and are going to remail my scores.  *buries head in hands* In other news . . . um, I figured out how to delete posts all on my own.  It's kind of fun - so if anyone's been seeing posts that suddenly disappear five minutes later, that's just me reveling in my one discovered technological skill.  It's about the only thing I *can* do. And Conrad. . . you're definitely my favorite little brother ever.  Love you lots - maybe we should make a calendar and start marking down days? ^_~ Later!

      Well...I thought I would make one post before I went to bed so here it is. POST. Anyway saw some friends and had some fun, besides that today was very uneventful. Think tomorrow will be the same, G'night all hope Satan doesn't wake you

      Conrad's taught me how to post - I thought I knew, but apparently it takes more effort.  Wow,  that's  ironic.  Dollface, dearest love of my life, I'm going to try to call you later, but be prepared to pick up for a phone number you don't know.  LadyNeptune - well, first get a shorter name ^_^ - and I'll try to call you, too.  How could I not try to get ahold of my favorite lesbian lover?  And Conrad - you're definitely the best friend a demented gypsy could ask for.  Even if you won't admit you're my  little  brother.   Sedgie  - were you wearing the necklace this morning?  I didn't notice - and we're so calling you Sedgie from now on. ^_^  To all the rest of you out there in the ether, it's one of those days.  It's one of those lifes.  And I've had the same song stuck in my head for weeks and now I can't remember a word.  It's something like "I'm With You" by some girl.  Got it stuck in my head in the bus station in Texas, and now I've lost it.  Lost a lot of things.  And I can't find the shirt - which oddly enough, is the thing that currently matters most.  I'll be seeing you.

      Do you know what's really funny? Well, to start things off my name isn't Conrad, none of us actually use our real names. I can understand if that isn't funny to you, but after reading the posts I discovered that I didn't know anyone named Summer Gypsy, I mean that isn't a name, more of a title, then I remembered that we weren't suppose to use our real names. Ha ha I forgot, ha ha. Yea I know that I am very sad, but that's the only way that I have fun.  By the way today is Gen. Sed. b-day, so happy birthday you damn bastard.  Come by the house  to pick of your gift, I have Sharifah's too.

By the way if you notice we have been getting visitors, and all you vistors should comment on these damn blogs, I stay sober so that I can type these damn things, so might as well comment. Oh that reference to Dollface by Summer was actually to Shari. Peace out homie G.

      Breakfast this morning was delicious - and it's very good to be home. . . well, at Conrad's house, but it's still nice to be here.  He's making tea - but of course he's making tea. ^_^  Dollface -  darling  ^_~ - is coming over later.  I've been lost in the boonies of small college world recently, so I'm reveling in all the visiting friends.  And Sedg's birthday is coming up, so we get to screw around with him. ^__^  It's all good.

Sed., Summer, Lady Neptune and I are all going to blog it. Hope you'll enjoy the fresh look, coming up next week (hopefully). Anyway back to bussiness. Today NYC experienced the worst weather, we had ten-mintute thunderstorms.  TEN MINTUES , what good is that? It's like fucking mintute men who can barely last, curse you minute men...Brings back memories of old...of Africa. Man, I am one sad mo-fo monkey, anyway peace out, keep your head out of the OJ.

       THE THREE MOST ANNOYING EYESORES IN NEW YORK CITY  (seriously these things are really annoying) :   The New Hummer. Not only is this crap ugly, but it takes up the parking space of a mini van, and then some of the active road. Not only that, but it gets like negative four mile per gallon.  Those really annoying scooters. The people who use these machines are lazier than hipoes. I can walk faster than most of them.  They have wheels! Yet they want a petrol guzzling machine that will take them 10 miles per day. Why not get a mo-ped, even they are better! These scooters might have been less annoying if they were quieter, but nope, not even that.  Last but not least, the new Mc.Ds. It uses more electricity than a entire subway line.  Tsk, Tsk, Tsk, and I had to witness them all on friday, poor poor me. 8(

Since today is going so slow, I decided to take some of those online "personality tests." Here are the sad, sad results.  My crappy little elf name is  Brookbank Hairtoe .  urlLink What's yours?

      Hey,how is it going? Today was fun...Really it was. My mom came home early, so I didn't know if I would be able to go hang out. After a completing a string of tedious commands, I was allowed to leave. I hung out with my mentor with for awhile. We went to this diner and lunch with one of his business associates, who was a one point a english teacher. The menu at the place was ridiculous. I ordered a crab-burger and had to pay like 9 dollars. The wasn't the worst of it, my mentor (Asok) had to pay 5 dollars for a tiny milkshake. After the late, but seriously expensive ($50) we headed out to the movies. You have to understand, I really wasn't in the mind for movies, but since it was his treat I agreed. We saw the new  urlLink Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle movie.  The movie was okay, not as great some people make it seem (*cough**cough* Sharifah *cough**cough*). It was reasonably funny, but a lot of the jokes were either really perverted or a little on the haha not really side. The plot was flowed well expect two points at end which I won't ruin for anyone who hasn't seen the movie. The soundtrack for the movie was pretty good, but it didn't flow with the movie that well, at some points you could say that you were just listening to a song with nice video graphics, but not like that of a music video. Otherwise all the songs are great, especially the one by Pink. The commercials gave away a big part of the movies, same with Pink's music video.  If you have watched all the commercials and Pink's music video ten to fifty times, well... You are pretty sad, but back to the point, it's like watching the whole movie.  The special effects which look really good when Lucy Lui is the one performing them are great. It's basically an extension of the matrix, almost as if they were all agents. For all the guys there is a part at the end when the girls are washing car and getting wet. *P (blind cylops with it's tongue out) Peace Out.

      Grrr - one would think we *were* in Texas, since it's gray and rainy.  Posting now, 'Rifah?  I'm so remarkably bored right now - mainly because my minute (and by minute I mean younger and larger) cousins are attached to the comp/tv and irritating me to an early grave.  *sigh*  I could use a good natural disaster.

      Well, the surprise party was  indeed  a surprise, as I was far too tired to be anything more than mildly suspicious when I got dragged to a comic book store for half an hour.  *shrugs*  Who knew?  But I got ice cream cake and presents, so I was pleased. In other news, Lance Armstrong is still winning the Tour de France!  This, of course, is of international importance - well, it ought to be.  And a hurricane is going through Texas - I think its name is Claudette.  I'm still somewhat befuddled as to why we *name* our hurricanes, so if someone would care to explain it? I also got an email from one of my best friends earlier today saying something about  1984 , the book by George Orwell, and it's relation to society today.  I've never read the book, but the comparisons were interesting.  It was talking about making English *perfect*, aka politically correct.  It brought up the way textbooks are being written today, and how information can be parceled out in just such a way as to paint a completely inaccurate picture about the way things were.  I'm not sure I understand why this would be done . . .well, on a logical level, maybe, but . . .I don't know.  Later.

      Hey there...hehehehe, threw Summer Gypsy a surprise birthday party, but it wasn't much of a surprise, but she says it was super. Now lets evaluate the super. Super: the guy who maintains the apartment building. Hmmm...Was the party the guy who maintains the apartment building, hmmm...Don't think so. Super: as in to have powers associated with heat vision, flying, and x-ray vision, and of course the super strength , none of which the party had. Super: Great, hmmm...Was the party great? I guess so since all the other choices don't work in context. I still don't see how it was a surprise. I was giving it away, she became suspicious but didn't throw around any accusations till it was too late. Ha Ha Victory!

      Hmmm.... This is a very strange predictment we have ourselves in isn't it. Oh haven't you heard, It's recently been reported that President Bush commented on the fact that's he is okay with the CIA's reliance on bias, unsupportable evidence about Iraqi "WMD" (Weapons of Mass destruction). You can check out this article at: urlLink New York Times.  I just tried to find out what the exact address was, but couldn't but managed to find that they had another article labeled: "Bush Aides Now Say Claim on Uranium Was Accurate." Don't really know what to believe if they keep doing this kind of shit.  Also in today's NY Times:  Rumsfeld Says Iraq May Need a Larger Force.  Why would Iraq need a larger force, it's been conquered! There isn't anything there expect people with rocks, their nuclear properties extend to boulder technology. Oh my best take of those dangerous Iraqis before they drop a boulder on my dog. Peace Out, I think I'll get me a dog and crush it with a boulder.

      If you haven't noticed, there is a new person making posts at this website, and she isn't a drunken monkey, and doesn't usually ramble. This person is Summer Gypsy, my friend who has agreed to help with this crap. Anyway, saw  urlLink The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen . Overall it was a pretty crappy movie. The only thing that made this movie bearable were the characters. The plot was really crappy, the movie is only bearable if you believe:  World War II started in 1899 British special officers pretending to be Siberian Germans started World War II  the stereotypes about Americans and Indians are true.  There were a bunch of Indians guys with guns at one point, but they really didn't do much. It seems that the entire point of their existence, was to die at mongolian/siberian/german/british hands. Why is it that the Indians always get pimped? It was like the Afgani crpyts versus the American Army. Speaking Of Americans, the only American in the movie was the inpatient youngster who shot at everything besides the target. The thing that really pisses me off about his movie is that I ran to see it, literally. My friends and I ran against the win for about three streets and three avenues, trust me that's a long distance. Peace out till later.

       This is just a reply to something I saw on the  shout outs   (located on the bottom of this message, check out the old one HaireePhetus is very funny but it's all true, at least in my opinion).I completely agree, commercial are very stupid, I think the people making them are ignorant of the needs of their viewers. For example, a beer commercial has two guys dreaming about women mud wrestling.  What the hell does that have to do with beer?  Usually the actors are so low rate that they've been kicked out of mime school (god damn I hate those mimes). On the matter of Starburst, well...Those people have no life, their commercial resembles the hang over that I have after a night of heavy drinking. It's very sad that people fall for this kind of advertisements, and of course end up as obesity hippos who can't fit through doors. On the other hand if there is ever a food shortage, we can always eat parts of these people due to their fat. Hopefully it won't come to that. Fat people would love to be thin, and still eat like a damn rhino, so they think that if they switch their diet over to slim fast, but 3 gallons of slim fast won't reduce your weight. Fat people are funny. The funniest fat person was the one who had to  crane lifted  out of his house. Magazines are very horrible, its true that everyone is perfect as themselves but if you want to change to better your life span, then go ahead. These magazines though will not help you, in fact they might cause you to drop into depression and gain more weight.

      Its been two days since I have had cable internet, and I feel as if I have seen it all, and now I want more. The only problem is that  I have reached the end of the internet.  Yes, as sad and disturbing as it sounds it is true. I have visited almost every single blog, laughed at every single stupid web-comic, well... That I'll leave up to your imagination. I would spent my time online playing games with all the other geeks, but they aren't that friendly plus they hack (damn hackers). I feel as if my computer is sucking my life force out of me. About two minutes ago I updated a sketchy part of the blog template, and discovered since I hadn't used any blog titles, the tag shows up, hmm.... Gotta fix that crap. I think this whole thing would be better if I was wasted. Yesss... Design a website while I am wasted...The good O'l American way. I think I'll try that, peace out (I am going to call my friend up and arrange for the wastage).

       I finally have cable internet.  This is a big step up from my 56k, which sucks my mother's giant gorilla balls. The cable guy came like two hours ago and set it up and he had to replace the cable wiring, not only in my own house, but also in my building's roof. the connection in my house was fried it was like breakfast gone wrong. Anyway I used for the first time like ten minutes ago and it wasn't a slice of Heaven, but the entire cake. Ummm...anyway its Starcraft time, so peace out.

      Funky as in it sucks the balls of a ten year moose whose antlers are only reflective on its small and dagger like cock. Anyway I haven't gotten wasted in such a long time, I think my liver is actually recovering. I could definitely use some Bacardi to put my liver into the dark yet pleasant age. During the time that I have been sober I have noticed some very stupid things, which not only assure me that there is no hope for humanity, but also that I was better off wasted.    The commercial line for Sour Starburst is, and I quote "use responsibly." WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSE TO MEAN? How the hell are you suppose to use candy irresponsibly? Are you stupid enough to choke on a lifesaver? OR are you incredibly depressed and try to strangle yourself with taffy?    Next thing that I noticed that when I was finally sober is that people are getting ass implants! Why the hell would you do that? What, just in case you need a flotation device during the next great flood?   Well...That's enough for now! I am going back to sleep and hoping that everything becomes better.

      *Fabulous* day.  Let's start from the beginning.  Went to Borders - now we are *all* going to Borders this week.  You want to know why?  Because they have Pumpkin Spice coffee now!!!!!  It's the best thing ever.  Conrad, Doll, Dead', Sedgie, and hey, Hyperspaz, can you come?  I have Wednesday and Tuesday completely free, but Thursday and Friday before work I can do, too.  C'mon, lazy bums. ^_^  School is starting *very* soon, and we so need one last summer hang out.  *pouts*  I promise not to make anyone do Turkey in the Straw!  Number two - there's an Alexander Hamilton museum!!!!!  I want to go!  Number three - caught the kitten!  It took a freaking lot of effort - not a word out of you, Conrad!  And it's now sitting on my lap purring happily . . .you should all come over and see it.  It's name is Toby Scarmaker . . .Toby for Conrad, Scar was my original name for it, and it scratched me and mom up lots so she suggested I alter it slightly (the name, not the kitten).  Number four, not to be neglected - I went *shop-ping*!  *That was supposed to be trilled*  I spent over a hundred dollars, but I got so much *stuff*.  Clothes, bag, and thirty dollar shoes that are Naturalizers and *soooo* comfortable.  Well, we're going to Borders. . .That's an order.  ^_~  Love you all!

       Hey! This is the first comic strip. The strip will be weekly, in simpler terms there will be a new comic every Sunday at midnight. This one is my first, please send me any criticism you have. Thank you. I would personally like to thank Deadinside and Dollface for all that they have done and the troubles and nagging they had to suffer because of this comic strip.

      Why does Conrad insist we post all the time? It's as if its deadly necessary or like he's getting something for it...I dunno...consipracies...  Anyway, if we're back to songs..well, I have a bunch to choose from, like this one (I got Dollface to like it recently):    Nirvana - Son of a Gun  Up up up and down Turn turn turnaround Round round roundabout And over again Gun gun son of a gun You are the only one Makes any difference what I say  (x2) The sun shines in the bedroom When we play The raining always starts When you go away  Up up up and down Turn turn turnaround Round round roundabout And over again Gun gun son of a gun You are the only one Makes any difference what I say  (x2) The sun shines in the bedroom When we play The raining always starts When you go away  Up up up and down Turn turn turnaround Round round roundabout And over again Gun gun son of a gun You are the only one Makes any difference what I say  (x4) The sun shines in the bedroom When we play The raining always starts When you go away  (Originally by the Vaselines)     Apart from that, I realized, I've lost my mind. I've recently been trying to learn about astrophysics, (specifically regarding orbital bodies eccentricities and other weird crap like that), other stuff about astronomy...and Maltese...I will never make it, and I doubt I'll learn what I remember. I  gotta go back to other stuff I started but never finished learning, like all those languages I though I could learn at the same time. Boy was I wrong, I'll probably try again when I'm not so lazy. P.S.,  Aus Gamers? sounds German. (Out Gamers)  I'm Deadinse...and that'll never happen!  "Me dijo un señor, una vez, un señor de parecido de sabio, pero con vida de portero, que aquellos quienes buscan por un sentido muy profundo en lo que piensan, se torturan, y se atormentan sobre lo que no merece tanto análisis. Cuando le pregunté, 'Señor, ¿cómo es que un anciano, tal como su merced, sepa tanto, de semejante cosa?' Me respondió con, 'Hijo...como crees vos, ¿que terminé yo así?'"

      ::IamAEvilMonkey has left the game:: ::IamAEvilMonkey has exited Battlenet:: Eheh... Funny shit. Anyway here is a comic update: I have three comics drawn, one is with Deadinside waiting to return to me in JPEG or PNG format; it might make its way to Dollface though cause she has cable and can send it to me faster. The last couple of attempts to get it to me through email/file transfer by Deadinside have failed. Recently I have drawn up two more, but I think this time I'll find some other way to scan them (hopefully). I have just discovered that most of the PC/X-Box gaming community doesn't reside in either North America or Japan, it actually resides in Austrailia. If you want to join the community or want to see the evidence of this claim just go to:  urlLink AusGamers.  They have almost every single demo for almost evey single PC game out, not to mention reviews and previews which will knock your boots off.  Their servers are kind of slow and so the download time for a demo is kinda long. For example it took me three hours to download the demo for Unreal Tournement 3 (which by the way is about 300 megs). I JUST FOUND OUT THAT PRINCE OF PERSIA IS COMING OUT! Prince of Persia took up most of my time when I was a child and will probably do so again when it is released by Ubi Soft sometime at the end of this year for consoles and GBA.  Well... maybe a little while after that when they release it for PCs. This game looks incredible. The best part of this is that the game will be using the Splinter Cell engine! For those of you who have play/seen Splinter Cell, you know what I am talking about.  Oh my god it looks so good! P.S.why do you guys hate Bill?

      I'll be yelling thought this post, 'less I say otherwise.  Well I'm glad we're all out in the open about this! YES, that's right! It's is very UNpeppy! And do you know WHY?! BECAUSE NONE OF US ARE REALLY FREAKIN' PEPPY! I know I'm sure not! Conrad, you're an idiot, Bill needs to die.  This is GREAT! The last few posts have REALLY said it.  The darkness flooding over the past few days, I love it! I enjoy that kind of thing, when we all realize how things really are! How we all really are! I am demented, insane, an addict, and I hide in corners! That's the world, fear, hatred, deep depression. The General's got it there, with Mr. Poe, everybody knows, that the best poetry is written, when you're horribly depressed...or I guess if you marry your 15-year-old cousin...but whatever.  Tears stream down our enmaksed faces, to show off the best of things, while we tear and burn within, with what we try to deny or forget! But it's always here, there whispering to you from the back of your mind! Haunting you at night just when you're about to sleep, in the darkness, to soak your sadness, and bring you out from the joyus fantasy world you created! Learn to LIVE IN IT, FEED from it! We all need to accept it and grow strong from what tries to get us weak, b/c we survive on "negativity" anyway.  Stop the yelling. I'm Deadinside, and now, another uncredited quote, 'cept this is a very funny comedian's bit. Enjoy...  "...You know recently, I found out something, and it's absolutely true, I just found out but uh...when Coca-cola first came out, it actually contained cocaine...as an ingredient.  Yeah it's true, but then, so did..cocaine sandwiches....seriously, but just for like, the first few weeks, then took it out. Yeah, people were going crazy in the deli's. But no, can you imagine? What it must've been like? People must've said stuff like :: pretends to hold up Coca-Cola bottle:: 'Have you TRIED this stuf?!?!? I LOVE IT!....I've been drinking it for FOUR DAYS IN A ROW! I tarred my roof! My wife left me...I'm alphabetizing EVERYTHING!....Pepsi SUCKS...Pepsi's for LOSERS....all those Pepsi people with their "JOBS"...'"

      One of my favorite poems, and so I'll post it so I won't lose it.  The Raven. By (the great) Edgar Allen Poe  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. "'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door --                                         Only this, and nothing more."  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow -- sorrow for the lost Lenore -- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore --                                         Nameless here for evermore.  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door -- Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; --                                         This it is, and nothing more."  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you " -- here I opened wide the door; ----                                         Darkness there and nothing more.  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" --                                         Merely this, and nothing more.  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before. "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -- Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--                                         'Tis the wind and nothing more!"  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -- Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door --                                         Perched, and sat, and nothing more.  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"                                        Quoth the raven "Nevermore."  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning -- little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -- Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                                        With such name as "Nevermore."  But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered -- not a feather then he fluttered -- Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before -- On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."                                        Then the bird said "Nevermore."  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -- Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                                        Of "Never -- nevermore."  But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -- What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore                                        Meant in croaking "Nevermore."  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,                                         She shall press, ah, nevermore!  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee Respite -- respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"                                         Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! -- prophet still, if bird or devil! -- Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -- On this home by Horror haunted -- tell me truly, I implore -- Is there -- is there balm in Gilead? -- tell me -- tell me, I implore!"                                         Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil -- prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us -- by that God we both adore -- Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -- Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."                                         Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."  "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting -- "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"                                        Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."  And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor                                         Shall be lifted -- nevermore!

        Aww man, screw you! You're those computer virsus sent via eMails. We want you to go away because you fill our computers with nougat filled hatred and make them crash. You're even worse than that person who thinks they can curse the world.    urlLink   What kind of eMail are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   I have just been told that I am stupid, and I agree; I am stupid like a fox! This was told to me after I discussed the theory of me not existing with my brother. Yea, much fun. But I am sure that I do not exist, I mean come on, I don't even get any viruses.  Anyway I want to start a cult; a great cult. A cult that has stuff... and they do stuff with the stuff. Stuff my cult will have to believe in and follow these rules because I said so:   Rap music shall be defined as voodoo music.  Alchol shall be consumed.  Names shall not be named.  Mole people shall be hunted till they renew the alliance.  Cult members must have either stealth powers and be refered to as Splinter Cells, or have heat vision and be willing to lay down their lives in order to destroy the conspiracy against Bill the Penguin.  Bill is God.  Believe and ye shall be saveth.

      Been pretty boring lately, there isn't anything interesting to talk about besides my problems, which I will never again bring up because this is suppose to be a peppy site. The comic that I wanted to start up is being passed around to people with scanners; Deadinside tried, but when I recieved the copy, it looks like french trench during the first few weeks of World War I, in other words it looked like crap. It's like 1:41pm I am reduced to making a post... Concerning posts, I am sorry for two things, 1. not making a post yesterday. 2. for making that really depressed post two days ago. One thing that has humored me lately is that everyone besides me is getting this So.Big virus; I haven't even gotten spam in my mailbox, not even spam concerning how to protect myself from this virus. Maybe this means that one likes me and so I am not in their address book, and that's why the virus hasn't come to me. On the other hand, I am pretty sure that someone out there has to have me in their address book, or I wouldn't exist.  OH NO! I DON'T EXIST!

      I return, Conrad's near ready to kill me (along with other people I'm sure) but he specifically wants me to post, so, here it is a post.  I'm a little lost, a tad void of any clue (hark...a double entendre) so I'll just wing it and see where it takes me.  I hope all are doing fine, as I attempt to integrate myself with the city that I have missed (and the summer I have missed) for the past few days, and ah school rears its head.  Umm....I read a comic book today, it has a few entertainingly worded lines in it (and they say that those things rot your brains) so i suppose I'll share 'em and see where the wind takes it from there.  "...To have my life mean something.  And I think, for the most part, I sucdeeded. I flew high.  I flew well.  It's just that, when I finally failed...I had such a long way to fall.  I go over it and over it and over it.  What was it inside me that shattered?"  and  "...There are some who claim that life on earth is nothing but pain and suffering.  That  people  struggle through brief pitiful lifetimes and die...frightened and alone.  No purpose.  No meaning.  Look at the world one way...and the viewpoint's understandable.  There is terrible suffering.  There is pain and madness that seems inexplicable--if not simply evil.  But there are others who believe our suffering is a doorway to something better.  That our pain helps wear away the masks and lies we've come to identify with...and reveal the radiant authentic selvesthat hide beneath our personalities and egos. ...And I think there's truth in that"  so there ya go...If you took the time to read that, well then, I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you got something out of it as well.  I suppose I'm done for now, talk to you all later, I'm off to go rally the masses (as a General may do...non?)

      Is it clear we're all getting tired?  We don't normally write like this.  Dollface, you're gorgeous.  My favorite ALMIGHTY!!! ever.  Conrad, I figured it out.  The difference, I mean.  The difference is that I've been trying all along - don't you see?  I know the difference between single parent kids and regular kids now, too - funny how much time work leaves for contemplation.  Single parent kids are always sure - somewhere - that they aren't wanted.  And you know why?  It's cause they aren't.  Funny thing, when grown ups don't know how to grow up.  Funnier, the legacy it leaves.  And if it's all about being wanted and trying and  . . . the universe, maybe, then leave me out of it.  Because it's one of those days where you look down at the receipt you're writing on and realize that tomorrow (today) is your best friend *ever*'s birthday and you haven't gotten her anything.  And then you get home and discover that your sister is a ---- and maybe you are too (maybe we all are) and what is this gaping hole that we are all trying to fill?  And I'm so tired of . . . . all of this.  Reading these is no way to learn about someone's life.  But it doesn't matter anymore.  When I grow up, I want to have a papasan chair to curl up in.  And a down comforter.  And a lot of books.  And coffee.    There is nowhere left to hide There is nothing to be done No people to be saved No pets we've never named Forty miles from the sun  As darkness craves the mind We come undone without our pride No time on earth to come All the pleasures just begun Forty miles from the sun

      I am not an obsessed little freak, just envious. It's not the person; it's their attitude towards life. Their attitude is shit happens; so what, I am always going to be a lil peppy person. Never have I seen something like this. This is exactly what I was looking for, ever since I was lost. It feels like a thick fog surrounds me, the only thing that I can see is her happiness, her peppyness. How the fuck does she manage to do that? Depression comes and leaves for most people, but there are a unlucky few who have it orbiting them. These are the same people who are obsessed, not over the person, but over the peppyness. Why? Could it be that I have lost my ability to be happy? If so it must have been stolen, but by who? Is she like a wormhole, sucking in all the happiness around her. No because I feel happy being near her, makes me feel as if my happiness has come back. No, this can't be envy, but then what is it? The best comparison I can make is to vampires. I feel as if I am the vampire that hungers for blood, soul, something that I lack to fill a part of me that is calling. Yet I also wish that I never had to do such because of the pain. All I want to is to be the one with the blood, the peppyness.

       Yes sir, step right up and pick up your copy of MTA workers gone wild!  It shows why you should not let three ex-convicts use a hose, bucket, and two brooms in order to clean a Subway station. It can only lead to the worst. They were all wet for god's sake. I tried to pass by politely, but no, one of them had ot spray me in the ass with water. I hate them! After the sexual assault I left to the opposite side of the station and took the train home. I hate the MTA

      Feral kitten?! What the fuck does that even mean?  There's not much to say, when you lead an empty hell-hole of a life. Band practice today, some good recording, maybe this one will sound better. I'm hating it there a bit more every day. I like having to CREATE my OWN parts, but that's not really possible with Eli. I dunno, maybe it's just me. I'm good at threatening, maybe that'll help me.   Iggy Pop - Your Pretty Face is Goin' to Hell  Awwright! Woooohhhh!  A pretty face and a dirty look I knew right away that i'd have to get my hooks in you Yeah yeah yeah I'm running low on my memories If you wanna make a fuzz, boy, you gotta be a tease, uhuh A-say yeah yeah  I need it all, baby, that's no lie I need a lover with an alibi I wanna fall into a love so sweet Honey baby baby I'm hard to beat  Smell of flesh and I touch alone Smells in the air and I'm feeling so alone, uhuh A-say yeah yeah Hallucination true romance I need a love but I only got a face, uhuh That ain't all  I'll tell ya honey it's a crying shame All the pretty girls really look the same I wanna fall into a love so sweet Honey baby baby I'm hard...hard to beat  Wooooh hey hey Your pretty face is going to hell Your pretty face is going to hell  Honey honey I can tell Your pretty face is going to HELL!!!!

      Well... There is no need to agrue about this. We all know that you are a feral kitten, come on admit it. It fits in the scheme of things; makes the picture whole. By the way this whole thing about Mars being so close tonight, well fuck it. I can't even see it when I walk out of my apartment. This just means that Mars does not exist in my universe. You hear that you wannabe-existing-planet-piece-of-crap-hole. For the last time and I am not going to ask Marx! I hate that man, he is like the gay version of the girls gone wild mixed with satan's computer, which is filled with outdated software made by Mircosoft.

      Song by  Simple Plan .  *Not* what I thought they were singing, but that's okay.  Dead' - all right, what can we do that won't make you wanna go home? ^_^  Doll, you poor girl, next time you're on a roll, take a breather. ^_^  Well, *I* had fun today, and am currently furious with the college board *thing* because it won't let me register.  Ooh ooh, and I watched  Star Trek: Next Generation  tonight!!  *Love* that show - watched Gambit . . .this is pretty much only for those of you who are as dorky about this show as I am, cause no one else will get it.  It's the two part where Picard is Galen and it's smuggling and drama and *sooo* good.  No, I'm *not* a nerd. ^_^  Oh, and Conrad? -  I am not a feral kitten !!!  Hmph.  *Really* ^_~

      I hate Bill. In fact, I shot him with the Army's new  urlLink XM8 machine gun , which hasn't even been made yet! Nothin' like a non-exsistant gun to shoot a non exsistant penguin. And while Bill's not home...well...let's just say we know why his kid's half-human.  Anyway, now that I've finished freaking everyone out, comes the self-depreciating section of my post.  I tried to rollerblade today, b/c Dollface and Summer managed to confuse me...and it was the last mistake I will ever make. Couldn't you girls have gone your whole lives without seeing me fall SO many times? I personally would much prefer to keep my incompetence well-hidden, or at least show it, in a not-so-painfully-embarrasing manner. Yeah, complain all you want that you've already trained me to try not to be embarassed in front of girls, but I can't help but,...I fell NINE TIMES...COME ON!

      No way! Bill is so meant to be. In fact he is sitting next to me right now, and he doesn't appreciate you spreading such vicious lies about him. So what if people sit on him, he still manages to come out of it unruffled. By the way "Toby, go pick me my cotton." For all those of you who indulge in funny shit, check this out (beware it's not meant for the faint of hear/fart or those who have 56k modems [3.07 meg file]):  urlLink The Alien Movie.  It gave a chuckle, kinda like that nerdy kid who had pretended to be a Jedi ( urlLink click here to check it out )

      For example, Bill the Penguin.  Not only did he *never* exist, he still doesn't.  You can't resurrect an imaginary character. . . especially after he's been sat on. ^_^  All right, kitten still uncaught.  Problem now is that I'm seriously afraid of two things: First, that I won't catch him before he turns feral/gets run over; Second, that if I do catch him he'll somehow end up with the name Toby.  He actually batted at my fingers last night, though, so we're making progress.  I guess.  Later all.

      Read this and you shall be enlightened on the ways of the world. BtP (Bill the Penguin) is part of this religion. Hear this now, loud and clear: I am now converting to the  urlLink Church of the Great Penguin

      Oh yea, then his name would be Bill (the penguin). I am seriously disheartened with life. There is nothing new to do; I would try taking a stab at my mother, but she won't take kindly to it. And so since I had nothing to do I have decided to bring Bill the Penguin (BtP) back from the grave. For those who don't know Bill was my best friend until he was sat on by people and Summer Gypsy decided to kill him. I still don't know how he died, but I am pretty sure it had something to do with bubbles and the lack or air in them. Poor, poor Bill, and so now I have decided to bring him back from the dead. He might even start posting on the web site... but all of you would probably think that it would be me using Bill's name. Nay, I tell you, Nay!  Now I really am starting to go crazy, hoepefully I'll do something tomorrow which will allow me to be saner... Probably not. I've decided to join a MOHAA (Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault) clan, so that I can have something to do on my spare time. In other words I get to live out my fanasty of being an WWII gay guy and shooting people at the same time. Yay!

      This weekend had just been one huge MOHAA (medal of honor: allied assault) party, unfortunately I have just been informed that yesterday there was a 24 hours Starcraft competition. Drats! Oh, well there will be more. Anyway MOHAA is the most fun online. So many people to kill, almost too many... Maybe not. By the way the comics that i was drawing up will hopefully be up by the end of the week. It all depends on who has a a better scanner, and can get the copies to me the fastest. Peace out x))

      Random revelation there. ^_^  But yeah, the guy at my work is being good - probably partially 'cause we had the *cool* manager today - so I'm happy with him.  And he's *teaching* me stuff. . . okay, so he's really not, and it's incredibly minor stuff, but that's all right.  I *think* the kitten's a boy . . .I'm not sure.  It's happier, though - now if I could catch it, we'd be set.  Of course, now I'm afraid to try and then to fail and then all the effort I've put in will have gone to waste.  So yeah, I'm panicked and not trying right now.  Tomorrow.  I'll try tomorrow.  *frowns*  Maybe?  Other than that things are going along.  Ooooh!!! I *finally* have rollerblades!!!  I have rollerblades - and they're silver and purple and I have wrist pads and they're so cool!!  I'm just thrilled . . .and probably sounding like an idiot.  I'll leave you now - go look at Mars tonight.  And stupid White Flag song by Dido . . does she have a funny pitched voice, or is it just me?   XOXO

      Today was the worst rehearsal ever.  We sounded like crap, the amps sucked, and the room was smaller than mine.  The last version of the recorded song we had was crap, and while the next was louder, it sounds bad and that damn solo's still there.  Oh by the way, thank you Dollface, thanx to your comment about the song, Eli decided to reconsider the solo! (NICE) Dun worry, I failed to mention your name and instead I said about 3 or 4 people hated the solo.  Too bad, it really does suck anyway.  Anyway, yeah it was early today, I got home at like...7? I think...sure, but after my mom started yelling at me as soon as I got in the door, I got to go outside and sleep against the side of a building! Nice! Also saw that Mongol, SovietSmurf, which means I didn't get to live in the street for too long...oh well.  I'm Deadinside, and that's my dream of life.  "She pissed me off, that pissed her off. She yelled, 'Eat me, bastard!' I yell, 'Ok, but I'm still mad!'"

      Why? Why are people so stupid? Tonight on my way to the Chinese take-out place I saw this kid on the corner. This stupid idiot was taking a piss by a car. At first I didn't think it was possible, I mean who would do something this stupid? Well then for the sake of the human race I thought okay, maybe he lives far away and he had to take the mean leak. Nope, after finishing his leak, he went into a building which was about five feet away (for those who know where I live, I am talking about the building between the bike shop and the pharmacy). Why would you take a leak outside when you just go home and take one at home? If you don't have a bathroom at home, just go to a neighbor; they'll understand.  You must really suck if you have to create a rumor that you are creating the best game system ever, just to get some publicity.  Really can't you think of something else, like a new breakfast special at a nearby Applebee's or maybe the fact that you are lying little crack-heads who work at a strip joint in Florida Keys.  For those who don't know what I am talking about, I am referring to the  urlLink Phantom . I just heard over at  urlLink Penny Arcade  that it's probably a hoax. I agree, it sounded too good to be true; there are too many problems to overcome for them to make a console like this.

      Eheheh... Mom's not home and it's fun centeral because I can do whatever I want... Which at this point (sadly enough) is to stay at home and play videogames. Also I wanted to ask is anyone had a scanner? I know Deadinside has one, but I also need someone who I see more often. Need to scan the first and maybe second strip of the comic. Please if you have one, just post or comment. Peace out!

      Stain*d's  It's Been Awhile  - Look up the lyrics, loves.  Go on, now. . .or *fine*, just listen to the song.  That works, too. ^_^  The kitten's still alive - and by bigger I meant longer, since I can still see it's ribs pretty clearly.  It's getting used to me . . .and by that, I mean that it doesn't take off once every three seconds anymore.  Now it's once every five seconds. ^_^  But tonight it ate til it got full, then looked at me and did this slow, squinty blink thing kittens do - and flopped down (out of reach, of course) and just stared at me. . . .Does this mean I'm making headway?  *shrugs*  Who knows?  But it'd be nice if the people at the gas station would stop asking me what's wrong!!!  And hitting on me, for that matter.

      Finally got to convince Conrad to take away my admin. rights.  I proved to him what I could do. I could get real bored and just start taking away all you guys' rights, or even kick you off the site, or just rewrite all ur posts to read stuff like "I-I like jello...jello's cool...I mean, it's good...it's ok. But..baked beans... they just rock.  Ever had like...a can, you roast it...of baked beans...over like a fire, slow roasted over dried cow dung? That's good, beans are like, tasty, like parkas." Obviously that would be bad.  Anyway, now that I have no power, I feel much better about all this.  Things are getting pretty weird for democrats in Texas. Seems that republicans now have the power and are trying to redistrict Texas so as to give the republicans the upper hand. To prevent this, democrats from that state have gone to New Mexico, to avoid being redistricted, a trend that's been goin' on for some time. Let's hope that the democrats get back into power, not just in Texas, but in the federal gov't too.  I'm Deadinside, and it's obvious I had nothing to say for today.  "Register Green, vote democrat!"

       urlLink Bush Orders U.S. to Freeze Assets of Hamas Leaders  I agree Hamas has to be stopped, but will just punishing one side will result in a whole lotta crap. It really sucks that the leaders of Hamas are having their assets frozen, while the Israelies are walking away with a little slap on their cheeks. Shouldn't President Bush ask the United Nations to raise some sort of sanctions against Israel; I mean it's understandable if they attack once, but they've been doing it for the last thirteen years.

      The kitten's not dead. . . .Or caught.  It is getting bigger, though.  And cockier.  If I'm at all sarcastic to anyone tonight - I've had a very long evening, and would like to throttle most consumers at the moment.  I might make the suggestion that none of us ever work in retail . . .it's hard enough dealing with the ultimate stupidity of humanity on a daily basis; it's harder to fold their towels and smile while you do it. ^_^   XOXOXO

      Well...Hyperspaz? yeah, you'll get the hang of it...er, hopefully? Oh and is this gonna be your permanent name? Why don't you just leave it at "LadyNeptune" or somethin', Summer and I think Dollface already made references to you by that name.  Yes...I was supposed to come up with some form of hang out, Dollface, but my raging incompetence and lack of recreational knowledge makes coming up with something to do, real difficult.  Conrad...that new"Phantom" thing seems kinda...suspicious...I don't trust the whole thing for some reason.  If it's possible, I think I'm experiencing boredom, or just lots of exasperation, think I might just be loosing my mind. I'f I'm off the grip, realign them according to standardized specs.  We're all just their machines with an oil change. Hey, anyone wanna hang?  I'm Deadinside and that's my subtle hint for today.  "Eating is like, the only disorder that seems to be disgusting. I mean, yeah with drugs and alcohol, women are like, 'Oh yeah, that guy's like, a bad boy, I wanna be with him', or something like that. But with food...you never see a woman say, 'Oh you see that guy with the triple-cheeseburger with drips of grease streaming down his face? I want him.'"

      No, this blog isn't about the tiny lines of writing at the bottom of a contract; I am talking about the band. It's pretty small, emerged out of Washinton (the state). The singer (Jerry) is Tycho from  urlLink Penny Arcade.  The only place that I've found with their music is  urlLink MP3.com. Very nice music. Check out some their lyrics:      english    she is not mobile, she just watches me  i am noticable when light catches me  i am illegible any way you look at me  you know my english has deficiencies   and is it any wonder that I  when faced with these odds  would even it with lies  and is it any wonder that i  surrounded by storm  surmounted by swarm  would attempt to obtain the prize   there's a terror to the scenery  a certain fervor to the front of me  and i count them as my enemies  those who mean to be close to me

Just wanted to ask the gang what they are doing tomorrow, cause I'll be downtown and I am wondering if they want to hang out. Oh yea, I now have a catch phrase: " I fight my inner demons everytime I go to the bathroom. " It's copyrighted so don't use it.

      I would like to make a gaming post, in which I'll bring up certain sensitive issues that bother gamers all over. First of all lets discuss the new console that is coming out sometime, they don't really tell you when. All they tell you is that you can register to reserve one when it does come out. For all those who don't know what I am talking about, I would like to introduce you to the  urlLink The Phantom . It looks really great. Maybe that is the problem, that it looks too good to be true. It's supposed to be easy to install, fast ("up to 3Ghz") and even wireless LAN built in. You're supposed to be able to play games with anyone over a wireless network. The funny shit is that there aren't any CDs or cartridges. The games are supposed to be online, and you can rent and download over the game's huge network. Last time someone tried to do this (that crap ass hand-held with 132 games built in) it sucked huge cock. Then there is the fact that you have to download the game, and that will take a while to download the game, even on a cable connection (hell it took me three hours to download the Unreal Tournament III Demo). Then there is the fact that wireless connections suck, they are slower than the norm and they tend to break off during bad weather connections.  The Phantom seems too good to be true, the only way it could seem better is if came with a helper monkey to turn the system on while you are sitting on the couch.  The video card that the Phantom will use isn't top of the line though, it will use the GeForce FX. On the other hand Microsoft is developing X-Box 2, which will have the Raedon built in. So instead of registering for some too good to be pixy gold crap, you could just wait for the new X-Box. Secondly and lastly I would like to say that everyone should buy/borrow/download/steal the new  urlLink Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic . It got really good reviews and the graphics look awesome (white trash word of the day).

      No, we aren't a music posting place thing; atleast I don't think we are. Nice to know that Dollface learned stuff about comps and networking. Not much to say today, sorry. It's pretty early. Oh, Oh, I can now confindently say that I play more games before 9am than most people play all day. If you want to play with me; just email me. I usually play Medal of Honor from 8:30am to about 10am; I am tevren. If you pefer to play *starcraft* (broodwars or normal) than join channel hses anytime between 11:45am to 1pm; I am IamAEvilMonkey. That's all for now, going to go kill people in MOHAA.

And 'Rifah, didn't you pick up that band from an  unspecified  mini-disc player? ^_~  Sorry I can't be online tonight, peaches, but I'm stranded in Ossining (stupid *job* thing) and won't be home til late tomorrow . . .  if ever. ^_^  So, uh, *Sue*, joined us, have you?  Does this mean you're actually going to be Sue Ann like I originally thought everyone was saying? ^_^  Who else is joining?  'Cause Dead' joined awhile ago - and yes, you dork, we do love you. ^_^  I got to drive around today. . . ah, well, I got to be driven around.  Lots of daydream time . . .we all need to go hiking.  Like I said, daydreaming. ^_^  And work got out early, which was nice.  No song contribution tonight, my apologies.  Hugs.

        Iggy Pop - Gimme Danger    Gimme danger little stranger And I feel with you at ease Gimme danger little stranger And I feel your disease  There's nothing in my dreams Just some ugly memories Kiss me like the ocean breeze  Now if you will be my lover I wish you were insane But if you can't be my master I will do you anything  There's nothing left alive But a pair of glassy eyes Raise my feelings one more time  Find a little stranger, find a little stranger Today you're gonna feel my hate say gotta gimme danger wild little stranger Honey gonna feel my hand Swear you gonna feel my hate Swear you gonna feel my hate  Daaaanger.... Little Straaaanger....(until song ends)    Now that's power right there, awesome song right there, download it now...I'm serious, do it.  Anyways, I'd like to say "hey" to "Sue", new here at posting, so, hey "Sue", how's it goin'?  In other crap, shit's the same as always, I'm getting progressivly pissed with the band leader of Lycanthrope, or however you spell that.  Still, we have a concert coming up in October, a "Battle of the Bands" at some school. As soon as I find out more about it, anyone who wants to go is welcome to.  It's gonna be real fun, and this one will happen...so long as I don't kill Eli first.  I'll put up with him b/c I can put him in his place too, but moreso b/c this is something I wanna do, and I can get on stage, no bull shit.  Even though most of you probably don't care, we also have a website under construction, but I won't give the URL 'till it's up and runing.  Also, I'm about to start mastering our latest recording to try to make the instruments sound out more, b/c we have real bad recording equipment. Once that's done, you can ask me for the mp3 if you wanna hear.   I'm Deadinside, and that's my death threat for today.  "¿Qué horas son, mi corazón?"

I'm quite saddened now.  I've filled out some job applications and haven't gotten a call back from any of them.  I felt rejected and unwanted.......oh well......I'm over it now......that was short.   Since I'm still new at this posting thing, I shall leave you all now.

       Do you have the time To listen to me whine About nothing and everything all at once I am one of those Melodramatic fools Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it  Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid Or am I just stoned  I went to a shrink To analyze my dreams She says it's lack of sex That's bringing me down I went to a whore He said my life's a bore So quit my whining cause It's bringing her down  Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid Or am I just stoned  Grasping to control So I better hold on  Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid Or am I just stoned  --Greenday (Basketcase) I love this song. Anyway couldn't update yesterday cause I came home late and had to go to sleep fast or else people would start yelling at me. The funny thing is that I actually fell alseep at around three in the morning.  During the time when I was staring at the ceiling, I decided to make a web comic (I've made this decision several times). Probably won't do it cause I am too lazy but, I can hope.  Anyway it's true Deadinside does smile, not often, but I've seen it. The  urlLink About The Staff  page is updated; check it out.

      Hm, now who could that certain someone you're talking about be, hm Dollface? Everyone knows I can't dance and NOR DO I SMILE! Believe me Dollface, you were there with me in fuckin' 217, you know how it was. If I was smiling, must've been my mother yelling at me to do so, so she wouldn't look like a bad parent in front of everyone else. Furthermore...I am not cute, I dun think my smile is either. Disagree all you want, I've made up my mind Summer and Dollface.  Glad to hear it Dollface, considering I might've been responsible for getting you sick n' shit. And WHO? Do you mean Zashid...or whatever...black guy? HEAVY accent of African origin? What are you doin' showin' other people my smile anyway?!?! I can't get over that, better move on to something else.  Helped my sis clean up her school room for the kiddies n' stuff.  Turns out schools are Darwinian nightmares for teachers just as much as they are for students.  All the teachers there seem to be against eachother, tryin' to rub eachother off. How do I know? Some teacher stole one of my sis' school-issue shelves, and had it replaced with a piece of crap (as if we wouldn't notice!) Dude I hate that bitch now! I cleaned out that shelf of rat shit and other crap and she goes and steals it from my sister?!?! What a whore. We recovered it and left all the stuff she put in it all over the floor, scattered..heh heh heh...  I'm Deadinside and there's my crime for today.  "Smiles only brighten up the day of those who have a bright light shining inside."

      Well, sorry Conrad, I didn't see ur post about that independence day thing. 'Sides, Deadinside does things alone...shut up...Anyway, sorry about that Dollface, I think it might have been my fault for your bein' sick and stuff...so yeah sorry...  Yeah, I know you girls love us, can't help but right? Ha ha ha...you're gonna kill me...Bunch of crap goin' on for those people unlucky enough to have chosen to eat a nice juicy stake, filled with E. Coli and other goodies.  Seems people just don't get the idea about THROWING ROTTEN MEAT OUT.  And eating it too? There are better ways to clean out your stomach you know.  Wow, I really have nothing to talk about, since I'm not gonna share my personal life...hm...well I'm just gonna wrap this up with more boring drivel and yet another uncredited quote!  I'm Deadinside, and I've effectively bored you all.

      I'm not even sure if that's a word, but what the hell; you only live once (I hope). Met Summer Gypsy today, had fun and so on. Nothing really out of the ordinary. Now I've really started to wonder;  is craptacular a word? Can it even function in the viod of slang terms too stupid to ever come out of a person's mouth?  ::Look through many different grammer books:: Guess what!  Craptacular can be a word!  Because of latin syntax, you can join  crap  and  tacular . It's very sad for me to see myself making such an ass of myself on the internet. But hey, What the hell it's not like my name's on the bottom of this post or anything like that... Shit...I fucked! My name is not Conrad,  MY NAME IS KUNTAKINTE!

      Yay! It's Indian Independence Day, well maybe not only Indian Independence Day. It is Independence Day for most of South Asia, and Southeast Asia and also some of Africa (I think). Just wanted to pop by and say Happy Independence Day to all (I've said that about thrice already). This was the first year I think that I didn't go to the parade, since no one could come with me. Going to a parade is not something you do alone, you always need someone to share the love with and there was no one this time, so I didn't go.    translation: Our India is the best in the World

On the up side, the man running the gas station told me I could have the cat - thanks, thanks a lot.                       I hate men.  Well, okay, I don't.  And no, I don't hate *you* guys, so don't get mad.  I hate. . . .that I'm paranoid that a guy's hitting on me everytime he talks to me.  And I hate brownnosers . . .stupid men.

I had the worst time there; it was so boring. There was nothing to do; my little cousins were annoying the hell out of me. Now I am back and ready to do stuff. Someone please call me and see if we can do stuff. Summer, are you free tomorrow? Can you come to the parade? What about you Deadinside? Anyone?      HAPPY INDIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY (which is actually tomorrow)

      Blackout indeed.  Well, mine wasn't so bad I suppose.  Hung out upstate, didn't go to work, got paid anyway, talked to people on the phone.  Tried to find that kitten . . .someone's been feeding it something besides cat food - I really hope people realize that with kittens this can kill them.  They get diarrhea and die.  It's pretty serious . . .but I guess they have good intentions.  Kitten might still be there.  Who knows?  Interesting thoughts to ponder. . . If this is the fall and decline of the Roman Empire, then as with the last time it's from the inside out.  And if that's true, then the twenties feeling is coming back into the rising generations.  Just an interesting thought, any comments welcome.  All right, *yes*, I admit the whole visitors who don't comment thing is just *odd* to me. ^_^  And I passed by a motion sensor light this evening and when it went dark I thought I had inadvertantly caused *another* black out.  It was kind of funny.

      I hate posting too much, so bear with me, I know you'd prefer to hear less from me.  I forgot to mention a few things about people I couldn't contact during this whole thing and I wanted to know how they were, that's primarily why I wanted to post.  Dollface, I wanted to call ya and see how you and ur familiy were doing, and Summer, you too, but I couldn't use the phone much, (mom mentioned something about mebbe getting the crap electrocuted out of me, and the phone I was using was expensive) until late at night when she was unconscious. Today I couldn't call b/c I wasn't home and the cell phone was having trouble. Conrad, I only have u cell number and didn't know whether or not it worked.  Well that's all, I'm Deadinside and I'll shut up for the next week.

      Ha ha ha!!!!! You bastards! Looks like being deadinside payed off. I enjoyed this mini-hell which was widespread through the North-Eastern United States. Damn Canuks, they need to be a little more creative than "lightning", 'sides they were blaming the ConEd station on 14th, when it was only responding to the sudden lack of electricity!  I dunno Conrad dude, I wasn't listening to that 1010, I know better, the shit is, no other station could quite wrap around their heads just how to report, relying on Washington's PR for transmission space.  But I just loved it, it was so dark, it was great.  I insisted on shutting the door in my room and staying in total darkness, from the time the sun set to the time I fell unconsious, only to awaken the next morning in a haphazard position, clothes and hair in disarray. Kinda like a big hangover, 'cept without all the vomiting and the three strange women, all to whom I am now married to... All the while I blasted the greatest music on my mp3 player, having hooked it up to some comp speakers, and maxing out the volume.  I was very eager to go outside though, as soon as I heard about the black out, who knows how many old folks might need some help up dark stairs? Or were dehydrated? How 'bout people stuck in elevators? Or the subways? Man seriously, but my mother wouldn't let me out, said sumthin' about me looting.  That's another thing I wanted to go out and kick some looter ass, I've got no remorse, or regard for my own safety, might as well put my pathetic ass to some good use and help out.  I can handle most handguns, some knifes and such! Let me do SOMETHING, but I could settle for dark solitary confinement with some Iggy Pop blasting...yeah...  I'm Deadinside and that all for today.  "I hope you'll love this song just as much as I do, listening to it in total darkness..."

      I have some good news and a whole crap load of bad news. Good news first, People now think I am 21 years old; not to say that I am not twenty-one. Anyway, now the bad news.  I broke my D string and the guy sold me a string. I couldn't tell the difference cause of the lack of lights, and ended up paying too much for it anyway. Almost got arrested for throwing rocks at the highway, only Juan and I didn't "know" that it was "wrong". I personally  couldn't understand a word of what they were saying cause they were speaking like deep mexican spanish (the people who were going to call the cops). Then all the messy shit started. People were setting off fireworks, people were rushing and raping the grocery stores of its supplies in the dark. My family then went to NEW JERSEY for the night. On the way we were listening to the radio; I think it was 1010 Win or something. The worst radio station ever! They speculated that the blackout was the work of terrorists/canadians/lighting or canadian terrorists who had found out how to harness the power of lighting.   You know that there is something really wrong with your country when radio stations start broadcasting the dangers of Canadian terrorists who have mananged to harnessed the power of lighting or made some pact with the devil so that they can destroy their "envious" neighbor down south of the border.

      Today I didn't stay home, instead I met new and old friends. The Math regents was today and I decided to go encourage them. Hope that they did well (for all of you you are studing english, the main verb in that sentence was "did"). Anyway met Ali and hung out, played pool and so on. I think Summer Gypsy is a little mad at me. All of you who loves games I have a couple of sites you should go to. The first is  urlLink Insert Credit . You can find video, pictures and other stuff of games that haven't even come out. Yea, the have people on the inside. The next is  urlLink Entdepot . I haven't checked it out yet, but will probably do so tonight. Anyway peace out till the next post.

      We all need to think a little outside the box now. That quote Dollface posted was GENIUS....GENUIS, you hear me? Good grammer or not, I totally support the idea behind it...I know, I'm anti-patriotic too. Damn vain, stupid, statesmen, patriotic cheerleader girls. (Though "statesmen" and "stupid" is usually synonimous)  God almighty wants to kill me. I say, give it a shot, I dare you.  Anyway, some badass virus has been goin around, its a worm, and it's pretty bad. As is if stuff like tapeworms and other stuff in real life wasn't enough. Anyway, NT based comps are at risk, so if u have any of these (2000, NT, XP..that's all I think) and don't have the patch, go  urlLink here  to save yourself.  And I still hate U.S. patriotism. Thanx Dollface, for bringing such an enlightening quote to our attention.  I'm Deadiside and that's what came out when I pushed all these buttons.  "YOU'RE WASTING GOOD PASTRAMI!!!!"

      Hey. This is my daily 2 cents, see you're lucky you get 2 more cents than the last dude/dudet (insert name here). Anway that quote makes no sense. I don't get it; so confused. I guess that means that artsy people don't have correct grammer and get lost in their own thoughts. I hope they know that "stupidity" is not a adjective.  Maybe it has some internal meaning within the maze of confudled crap but I don't see it. Anyway if anyone wants to see some really strange/funny art goto:  urlLink Exploding Dog . It's kinda like stick figures/ modern art but with a very "strange" touch to it. Try it out and that was my 2 cents for today P.S. Deadinside can hate blogger as much as he wants as long as he posts.

      Ahh I can almost taste the massive amounts of raging disappointment coming from Conrad regarding my last post.  Hope regret doesn't set in.  Deciding to post on here came with some massive moral conflicts. Firstly b/c I am against Blog and Xanga and the like. Then again I wouldn't mind an opportunity to try to piss people off or forecfully impose my beliefs on others...to each his own. But seriously, if I kept trashing Blog and the like, I'd look real pompous, and I didn't want anyone to think that I think I'm better than them because I don't post.  That's a lie, I just said that to make you feel better.  Well look forward to being offended or filled with unnhealthy amounts of emptiness, hope I said SOMETHING funny...  I'm Deadinside and that's my rant for today  "I look forward to when we meet again" "Better watch out, you're headed straight for a wall"

      Well then... I see that Deadinside posted. He really isn't crazy, I swear and yes punk rock rules. I wanted to post some pictures from my starcraft game, but they all came out dark and ugly. It was the best game ever! The General and me versus I think four comps on a money map (I know that it doesn't sound great). After about two minutes the General made a retreat into my base and following him was a mass of AI. After almost dying three times, he came back with Mutalisks (for those unfamiliar with Starcraft, mutalisks are gross flying units). By this time though I had secured my base with lurkers (hidden units that do mass damage) and had already killed two comps with hyralisks (ground range units). Great Game! It wasn't great because we won, well maybe it was, but more so because these comps were actually, kinda, almost good. If you want to download the relplay go ahead and do so  urlLink here.  Be warned you need Starcraft to view it.

In anycase, hope u don't mind that I'll say some confusing things that will make you scratch you head. This'll probably be the only time I'll be coherent, so, I'll take this time to say, hey Dollface! and hey Summer! and, Conrad is it? yeah I know no one else's name, so bye.  PUNK ROCK IS FREEDOM.

      My cousin likes Carvel . . .it's his birthday tomorrow.  Carvel is a cake, by the way.  It was chocolate, and has crunchy things.  Had work.  Didn't have chocolate cake . . . had carrot cake.  Made me remember my birthday. ^_^  Mine was better.  Guy at work figured out I was only in high school today.  Gotta love the awkward moments, huh Dollface? ^_^  Maybe now he'll stop hitting on me.  Suck if he stops talking to me, though - he's one of the few who does (that speak English).  Kitten (uh, Kitten the Third, I guess?) is still at the gas station.  Haven't caught it yet - Conrad's right, I'm filling a gap.  It's really tiny . . . and likes cat food.

      Or something like it. I had the worst experience this morning when I woke up... or afternoon when I woke up. My Roadrunner cable internet wasn't working! At first I was scared that the 56k monsters might creep out of my computer's modem and eat me. Then I raced around my apartment checking all the connections to see what might have happened. After completely exhausting myself, I managed to gather the courage and calling Roadrunner Tech Help. It took me about seven minutes of being on hold and three or four crappy "phone-elevator" songs to finally talk to a person, where I heard the worst news of my life.  Their servers were down!  They told me that it would another couple of hours till the service came back. I tried to occupy my time, but it didn't work. Next I tried to talk to my family (worst idea ever) and it ended up with a conversation about me studying bio-tech. in college. Next I tried to read, but I ended up picking out a "How to share your cable internet on you home network" book. In the end I was in a corner shaking back and forth till 2pm at which point my cable came back. Yay!

      I don't know who they are or what they are, but I would really like to thank the people at  urlLink Blogger.  They repaired the Archives so fast; it was fucking amazing. They are really fast. Anyway, today I hung out with Summer Gypsy and Zhang. We had fun, I got to be a  massuer , the guy who gives massages. Man I can't spell for the life of me. Also today Summer Gypsy was introduced to Family Guy, the  bset   best freaking show ever! Have a safe and hopefully not so drug free night.

      First of all why is Summer Gypsy changing the title of that post so much. Anyway today was fun, started the day with a nice glass of Orange Juice and and hmmm...probably going to end it that way too. I met Ali this afternoon, got him into joining our blog team. Do you want to join? Well that's too bad 'cause the only people who read this are those who already write for it and so you are already a part of us.... Damn it! Anyway as I was saying, I met up with Ali. we went and shot some pool, while we were waiting for Blaine. After pool we went and ate lunch at The Riverdale Diner. Best food ever, just don't rouch the coleslaw. I swear that it attacked me! When lunch was finished we decided to go catch a movie because Blaine was taking too damn long at work. We saw  urlLink 28 days later.  That is such a great freaking movie! The camera work is great, the actors play thier parts wonderfully. The worst part which I considered as a plus was that it wasn't really scary (I hate scary movies). It was more like zombies take over and this is what happens... Kinda like a reality show gone all wrong, but in a good way. The best thing about the movie: alternate ending. I mean how kewl is that, it could be like this or like that. The only thing is that they fucked it up and the movie doesn't end well, like if they added a scene or two it would have been perfect. The action scenes were awesome, but very gruesome as well. I had to look away during one scene when he stuck his fingers in the guy's eyes. Such a great movie; go see it!

You know Dollface said this title as a joke, though, don't you?  It makes us sound like we're tripping on LSD or something.  Not that we don't  want  to sound like that - it just amuses me.  And now that the titles are up there I absolutely love the new layout.  Secondly, work puts you in touch with some fucking *scary* people.  This middle aged guy comes up to this girl I'm working with and says (and I pretty much quote):    They wouldn't have anything for my nephew here.  He's six, and he told me for his birthday he wants an X-rated film.  I asked his mom and dad and they say he caught them watching one and it gave him a mini hard on.  I asked him what he was gonna do with the girls at school and he said he'd rip their panties off.  I told him by ten he'd either be a father or in prison.  He said he wouldn't mind being in prison.  I told him he didn't know the first fucking thing about prison, then.  Now my brother, he's always in prison.  He acts like he likes it.  Once he stole some cigarettes in front of a cop - and the judge said he wasn't gonna throw him in prison.  "What'll you do if I kick you in the balls?" my brother asked.  "What'll you do if I smash your face?" the judge replied.  So my brother tried to kick him in the balls - and the judge told him for that he was sentencing him.  "Thanks," said my brother.  And then one time my sister got a call from a lady who says it's amazing how much better my brother looks with a haircut and how good he is in bed - "Don't worry," says the lady, "I won't return him.  I live in Jersey."  "I'm not worried," my sister says, "He can't come into NY without getting arrested and thrown in jail."    Like I said, scary people.  But that was the most interesting piece of work.  In other news, I'm single.  My life has been summed up at various times in the evening by Jewel's  Dreams  and Blink182's  Dammit .  Of course,  Dammit  kicks ass as a song anyway.  So Dollface, we need to drag Lady out and go guy watching.  Have a fling . . .see how much free stuff we can get from the male cashiers.  Do *something*.  Just don't get me near that guy who came into the store earlier tonight . .or his family. ^_^

      It would be so awesome to have a terminator as the state's  governor, as long as it's not my state he is governing. For those who feel out of the flow read this  urlLink article  where he annouces his bid for the seat. The only way he would win is 'cause of his fame. I can see the campaign now: Vote for the terminator or be opperessed by mindless robots. Well... It's true, not like he would be lying about it. They are mindless robots. Anyway I just wanted to laugh and so here it is: hahahahahahahaha.

      Hey everyone! The new site is up. The only "real" problem that I have encountered so far is the July Archives. They are under the old name and so you can't get to them unless you know where they are. To help you out I'll post the address. It's at:  urlLink The Old July 2k3 Archive

      Eheheh... This is the new site, same old people, but with a whole new look! It's fresh like a new born puppy. Anyway there were a couple of glitches which I am fixing up right now. The funny thing about this is that the only people who know are well the General and Me. Gypsy and Dollface don't know! Imagine their face when they find out! Ha! This is the end of test number one

      Not only do monkeys cause damage, but they enjoy doing so. Monkeys have this style of causing damage that is unlike no other. For example: AIDS, thought to be spread to humans by monkeys. We all know that AIDS is a STD, but what we should consider is that AIDS is also the monkey's and nature's way of telling us to get off their ass. Come a normal person would have pulled out a 9mm and filled ya' fulla' lead, but the monkey has style. What does the monkey do? Well the monkey bites your ass for trying to rape it and this bite not only dooms you but stands as a warning to all those other monkey fuckers, damn sick fucks. I colored this really kewl picture, but I don't know if I can post it yet, I'll post it when I can. Y'see there is this comic strip site called  urlLink Penny Arcade  and the guy there drew this great picture of a japanese archer. So there is the picture and a little thing that says color if you want, so I color and I just finished emailing him and asking him if I can post it. Nothing more to say, go away... Far away, all of you!

      Went to Six Flags yesterday - excellent time, lots of roller coasters.   Spent the day with a bunch of guys - some related to me (sort of), some not.  One of them gave me a stuffed Tazmanian Devil. ^_^  Oh - and this was wonderful! - some girl was wearing a shirt that said, "Guys make  nice  pets".  Suffice to say the boys teased me  . . .about a lot of things, actually, but finally we all managed to agree that  my  girlfriends were cuter than theirs.  (Dollface and LadyN., that one's for you. ^_~  XOXO)  Conrad will like this - the ticket for the safari said, "Monkeys  WILL  Cause Damage".  Other than that, life goes on.  Dollface is absolutely wonderful - my other favorite lesbian lover (I really am saying this too much, one of you is going to hunt me down and kill me eventually. ^_^)  *sighs*  And you know what?  Softball coach was right - men aren't worth it . . .we really all *should* be lesbian.  Stupid propagation of humanity and all that.

      Well then, another late night Blog. Only thing is it isn't really late night, kinda like 11:26PM Eastern Standard. Anyway today was interesting. Had fun and other stuff. Robbed my best friend of a mini-disc, which I gave back to him later.  My Poem:   T'was a silver moon that night  A hot summer night  A normal city night with crime, despotism and the occasional robbery  The bum in the corner enjoys giving fright to the nearby child named Diggory Out of fright he holds his mother tight Until they are out of the bum's sight  A businessman is returning home He gets on the N train Along with the Pizza Hut guy There is baby who cries The crying drives them all insane Then comes in the bum with the Trombone He sooths the baby to sleep Just figures that he isn't really a freak   Thank you. Thank you; don't try copying this poem for two reasons.   It sucks hot rancid balls of Hellhounds. I'll find you and stick a hot poker so far up your ass that you'll wish that you would have never been born.

      Hmm... The world is round and has aliens. Well, at least that's what  urlLink Men In Black  taught me. Truthfully I believe that aliens exist because it would be very arrogant of the human race to say that aliens don't exist. Also if Earth was the only planet with life, then it would be a really waste of space (another movie reference, even though I can't remember which one it is). Aliens living on Earth in human suits, why not. Hell, if they have fat suits then why not human suits. It's kinda like a huge Halloween party. Then there is the other thing they (MIB) ask you to believe in order for this movie to make sense. They ask you to believe that the Earth is round. Now come on... A round Earth is almost as strange as Michael Jackson being straight. The people who live in a place I call "reality" agree with me that Michael Jackson is not straight, but for some odd reason they tend not to believe that the Earth is flat. Who needs reality? Not me. In my world Michael Jackson is not straight and the Earth is not round. I live in a great world.

      Man, I hate this shit. I tried to get rid of the stupid pop-ups with a javascript but  urlLink Blogger  won't let me. For any of you who want to know what the script is well... Here it is:  SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"   !--   function open() {return true;}   //--   /SCRIPT   just plug this in the head. Please don't sue me for this shit. Thank you. By the way i forgot to add the <>s of the scripts so you might want to do that.

      " Anyway, if there's a potential for a good to great relationship, then don't squander the chance because you're too much of a @#%$ to throw your balls in the ring. Regrets are a bitch, especially when you don't get play from them ." -evasivecolin  This is something entirely unrelated that an old friend/acquaintance of mine posted.  It made me smile - and seemed oddly appropriate in my life, so here it is.  Thought it should get more publication, and public notice . . .so now a good five of us will see it, no? ^_^  I'm tired.  I started work today - it went, as things often do, better than feared and more mundane than hoped for.  Would you like to donate a dollar to the Save the Children fund?  "Two-dollah"  What?!  Tomorrow? "What children are we saving?"  Um, ma'am, I really don't know. "Did you know only 15% of that goes to the children?"  No sir, really?  Do you want to donate a dollar to the Save the Children overhead?

      Yea, that picture that I posted last time completely messed up the way that the site is suppose to look. I finally updated the xanga site, but it still looks like shit. Not the good dope ghetto kind, but rather like the kind that you find in third world countries. You know the kind of shit that I am talking about, the one on the streets that you step and you are like "get that shit off my new ass nikes before these shits gets messed up, yo." If you want to check it out it's  urlLink Insert Coin Here.  Anyway in other news I am now retiring from a job that I never had and never will have,  rokect , rocket scientist. Well I can't even spell that damn thing, how am i suppose to be it. It feels good to be retired. Well this old veteran has to go take his teeth out, so peace out G-Moneyclip!

       We possess ideas, but we are possessed by feelings.  They lie too deep for understanding, astir with their own secret life and carrying us with them.   It's from this book I'm reading called  The Year of the French , by Thomas Flanagan.  He's hailed as wonderful, but all I can see is a reasonably good writer who has a slight obsession with the moon.  I suppose I have a bit of the obsession myself. . . perhaps it denotes some measure of Irish blood.  I think it's funny how much we worry about things that don't matter - summer jobs, standardized tests, how often I'm going to get lost on the train ^_^, that we forget about everything else.  I don't know - I suppose I'm thoughtful right now.  I lost a kitten this morning that I was trying to save - it was gray striped with one white paw and hungry.  It played with the tires of the car it was hiding under, but scratched me and ran away when I tried to catch it. Maybe it had eaten cheese, hmm Dollface? ^_~  So moving in with my little brother!  Uh, when he gets a house.  And did you know, everything goes better with rock?  Even if I am littering the internet. ^_^

      That's the secret to getting rid of weird parents. Another way to get rid of them is by using a double bladed lightsaber. Nothing can withstand that. You should have just pretended to be asleep until they just gave up and left.

      ...Married a dryer with no teeth...chopping up the last few good blues.  Unfortunately for all of you, I have come back to post. You must've all considered yourselves pretty lucky, not seeing me show up around here for a while. Well your little break's over, time to suffer again.  Looks like there are quite a few wholly inane problems that you people seem to be bothered with...well then let's see...  That's right, no one likes that english class, but you all took it, oh well.   Yes, that's right, physics and calculus are equally confusing, and it sucks if you take both classes at once, and u use the same calculator. You have to keep switching between radians for cal and degrees for physics, and if you forget to during a test, sucks to be you.   Yeah, parents do suck, if you've got weird parents, just ignore them or something. In your case you could have just said out loud, "Why are you still here?!" and pushed her out the door or window, your choice.  Now that's all for you.  Friday was crap, the week before was kind of like crap, yesterday was like crap, today is going to be crap, crap just can't stop happening, oh my goodness there is so much crap.  I'm Deadinside, and that's a lot of crap.  "Starting with me, everything in this place is mean and miserable."

      They're just weird creatures.  Today they woke up at an ungodly hour in the morning and left.  They were suppose to go upstate to do something...then at 1o something my mom calls home and tells me to change and go with them.  Meanwhile I'm thinking, didn't you already go???  Apparently not!  There was no way I was going, and she tried to get my dad into it, like, "your dad wants you to go, so get changed!"  Then sometime later, she came home and was trying to get me to go.  Of course I stood my ground and stayed sitting in front of the TV.  So she left mumbling something under her breath.  Then my dad called telling me to go.  What is wrong with them?  So I made up some excuse about having to study and stuff.  (Which I really do, but not really.)    And I was still thinking, "didn't you guys already go??"    So tell me, my friends, what is the secret to weird parents?

      Lesson Of the Day: "In physics if distance is negative it is called displacement. In calculus if distance is negative it is called rong." Harsh lessons are only learned when tests are failed or worse, barely passed. Life sucks and I need a drink. please send me lots of alchol. Please! Indian movies always have dance/song sequences in the strangest places, and they all suck.

      It's been a long time since I've posted. Ha and I get annoyed at the others for not posting. Anyway I have a semi good reason why I didn't post. It all started when my mother forced us all (by that I mean my brother and I) to go to New Jersey. They should change the name of that state from the "Garden State" to "the place where nothing happens." I have never been in a place so boring. Nevertheless I did have something to do; I had to watch over my little cousins and their friends. Oh my god! They are the most annoying fucks that I ever met! So annoying, "lets go look at the goats," "Come on, I never get what I want," "Shut Up! You just got ice cream!" My little cousin I could understand, since it was his birthday, but the rest. And I didn't even know where this freaking petting zoo thing was, but when we started walking, I could sense it. The smell radiated for at least 100 feet around the place. Not to mention that they (the little freaks) wanted to play with me. They just didn't want to play the game that I wanted to play (and yes I did suggest it later to a fat annoying kid). I wanted to play Jedi Master, where I am the Jedi Master and they are the mindless robots that I kill for fun. Later they were playing freeze tag, I would have played it with them, if they had accepted my condition. The condition being that I have to throw rocks at them and they freeze when I hit them, and stay that way until they bled to death. If you can't tell, I wasn't the life of that party. The most annoying thing was this fat indian boy who was wearing a blue tank-top that had a huge orange dick-like-object coming up to chest level, and the text read "Excited". God I hate those spoiled brats. Damn fucking kids.

I never realized how *sad* and *blank* this thing looks when I can't screw around with it. . . I mean, uh, look at how pretty it all it and not touch anything.  *pouts*  *twiddles thumbs*  And yes, English does suck.  Decidedly.  A lot.  But I don't have work anymore!!!  Saturday was my last day!  *squeals in joy*  Now if that damned kitten would let me get some *sleep* I wouldn't look like hell in school on Monday.  English. First and second period.

      The second week is officially over, and I've come to realize that I CAN'T STAND ENGLISH!  Nope, really can't.  There's a paper due on Tuesday and I have no idea what in the world to write about.  I'll probably end up paraphrasing the whole book anyway.  On a lighter side, I went to a concert last night, and it rocked!  The band that I went to see were really great!  It was a completely hipster crowd though, but that can't be helped.  There was this one girl who kept crowd surfing, she was so cool.  The the main show came on next and they were SOOOO OLD!  It was kind of funny in a sad morbid kind of way.  They were REALLY old!  The lead singer was all jumping around and stuff, and meanwhile I was thinking, "Is this guy gonna have a heart attack soon?"  The worst thing about it was, it wasn't that bad!  They were so energetic and jumping around and stuff.  And there were ALOT of people that were there to see them!  I left in the middle of their show, but if I could've, i would've stayed for the whole thing.    Tis all.

      Kinda bored.  Well...at least one week's down..only 42 more to go....anyway, I've got nothing to say, but I thought I might make this worth it and post something I'll make up as I go along..hope it makes sense...   Top 10 Signs You Might be In Trouble     10. You eat a hot dog from a 7-Eleven 9. You eat anything from a 7-Eleven 8. You find that most of one of your fingers has gone missing, and you just finished slicing some meat for that sandwich you've already eaten. 7. You wake up next to someone you're sure you had sex with, but wish you hadn't. Fortunately, they are of the opposite sex...unfortunately, they are not of the same species. 6. You find an angry mob of hooded individuals, wearing white, and weilding torches with a burning cross behind them, at your doorstep. 5. Your grandfather killed himself because you are ugly. 4. Your grandmother killed herself because you are ugly. 3. You vomit uncontrollably all over your date...for five full minutes. 2. Your genitals glow after a school trip to the nuclear plant. 1. Your ass pees    ok and now for another song you must download b/c it kicks that much ass...well...mebbe not musically..but the lyrics do rock.    Black Sabbath - Paranoid  Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify  Can you help me occupy my brain? Oh yeah  I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind  Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry Happiness I cannot feel, and love to me is so unreal  And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late...    GASP! What's this? A credited quote?!?

      Run! Write! Read! Cook! Make publisher documents! Work! Eat! These are just a few of the verbs that I have been using during the last couple of days. If you are really dumb, then you probably didn't notice that I have been pretty busy. I've been running around everywhere, doing things for everyone. Even the school secutary ( I probably didn't spell that right, but I have no time to spell check [have to eat dinner]) has me doing work for her. It really sucks, everyone and their whore is having me do stuff, not to mention that I have to get my program changed. Peace Out for now.

      The day of doom has finnaly fucking come!! We might as well just revert to primitive states where we just beat on others b/c they confuse us, or resort to cannibalism, even though there's plenty of food, simply b/c lawyers are still around! SCHOOL'S TOMORROW! WHY?!? WHY ME?!? and you guys too...  I have to get up frustratingly early and stuff, and I bet Imma get classes filled with assholes, cause that's my luck.  You guys probably have it good. Since the lot of you have a bunch of AP classes, you've got slightly less ghetto people around, but then again, you migh get stuck with arrogant bitches....oh well. It's all hell and hell again, you're fucked in either case.   Now for cruelty, b/c I can do that, (and maybe I'm getting a head start on all that reverting to a primitive state) HA HA, couldn't get your comic on time....  Besides that, I'll see all of you bastards tomorrow moring...THANKS FOR CUTTING MY SLEEP SHORT....D o Ed asswipes.  I'm Deadinside, and I hate you.  "Look on the bright side of suicide"

      How the fuck? Why the crap does that counter say over 600 visitors?!?! Who the shit else comes here 'sides us?  I hate people...a lot...like...a lot of people. Some tell me, that when I'm alone, the look on my face reflects the hatred I have reserved for every person in the world. Even that little insignificant person, in a far corner of the world, who might feel that I've left them out..I've got them covered too. I frequently get asked "Why are Yözen's eyes burning with hatred?" or "You look like you're about to kill someone!" or even "GODDAMN YOU'RE STUPID!!" Hmm...maybe that last one's kinda irrelevant.  Luckily, I stayed away from people today, tho I did feel an inkling to go out side and sleep against some building, but indoors is much better... I don't know a lot of words, so...Imma cut this short!  I'm Deadinside, and I am really dead inside...some one's gotta clean this up...

And my train had *issues* and some door down the line wouldn't close so we stayed at every stop like three times as long as we should've and I *got* to Mount Kisco after five.  *shakes head*  Evil.  Then exhaustion kicked in as soon as I got to work so I found myself wandering in a slow sort of haze and yawning a lot.  And Soheil learned I was in high school (figures they only wanna know when they're about to hit on you, bastards) so that should solve *that* one.  *big grin*  Uhhhh, pre-school meeting?  Heehee - little park, as per usual? Or will it be overrun with small/large ghetto children?  Dollface - maybe we get points as we *start* Fatality, and get like a big bonus at the end of the game when we win? ^_~    I had withdrawn in forest, and my song Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway; And to the forest edge you came one day (This was my dream) and looked and pondered long, But did not enter, though the wish was strong: you shook your pensive head as who should say, 'I dare not--to far in his footsteps stray- He must seek me would he undo the wrong.'   -A Dream Pang, Robert Frost   Because Frost kicks some serious ass. ^_~

      Well... I haven't posted in well... A day, so I decided to do it now. Hehe I made it sound like my eating habits."Well, I haven't eaten in two days, and I am not really doing anything now, so I might as well." Anyway where are we meeting monday morning and when? Today I finally worked off all those demerits that I got during the school year. But I still have to go to Legal Outreach tomorrow, but they are paying me tomorrow. Don't know how much though, probably not much since I would probably be considered cheap child labor... Well Goodbye all.

      Nothin' at all too interesting, fuck off.    Metallica - Fade to Black  Life it seems will fade away  Drifting further everyday  Getting lost within myself  Nothing matters no one else  I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give  There is nothing more for me  Need the end to set me free   Things not what they used to be Missing one inside of me  Deadly loss this cant be real  Cannot stand this hell i feel  Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony  Growing darkness taking dawn  I was me but now, hes gone   No one but me can save myself, but its too late  Now i cant think, think why i should even try   Yesterday seems as though it never existed  Death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye  Goodbye    Download it if you don't have it already, kick ass song, seriously.  I'm Deadinside, and those lyrics are amazingly accurate.  "So...T'm adopted. And I'm glad my parents told me too. Seriously, I am glad they told me, but uh...why everyday? The first time they told me, it was kinda weird, because it was the first time I ever recieved a...singing telegram....in gym class. Actually it was kind of a weird day for a lot of people in my familiy, because that's also the day they chose to tell my brother he was gay...and uh...that's-that's rough on a five year-old. Yeah...but it's great sometimes, because at those family reunions...you sit there...and you see...generations...of anger...and bitterness...and you might think to yourself...'How could I be related to these people?' And when that happens to me I think...'Oh WAIT...I'm NOT related to these people! Ha ha ha..these Jews are HILARIOUS...and uh..my you're looking good today "cousin" Mindy!'"

      I like that last verse, Conrad dude. (as probably expected from me)  We seemed to have had a pretty good hang out today, b/c we like, did stuff, 'cept Conrad had leave early for some waste-of-time program. Got to hang out longer b/c band practice was impossible today. That kinda rocked.  In-fuckin'-credibly, I have NOTHING interesting to share. C'est hard to believe, Nescafé?  Well to fill up space, and push old posts out of the way, I'll just rant, b/c I do that a lot. Rant rant rant...uh, that wasn't it I hope you know.  I don't want to go to college! They keep sending me crap about it, and financial aid, and about how great the campus and student body is, and I can't stand it!!!!! I get the worst feeling of desparation through my body, I feel the extreme need to tear my eyes out, or bash my head against a wall! I'm going to lose you all! I never should have made friends. Now I'll only lose them, loose them all, and they've actually become important to me...NOTHING is important to me! And now I'll lose something I will! I can't stand to think about it, and the worst, it's decision time comin' up where I have to do all this shit to appease the colleges, SAT II's, SAT's, essays?!?!?!? WHY?! I DON'T WANT TO GO THAT BADLY, but...I also don't really want to be alone...I didn't think I'd be around this long...I didn't ever expect to have to worry about any of this...

      I'm tired and can't type - had fun today, though.  Thanks Conrad, for putting it all together.  Toby/Scar seems to have a claw oriented version of Social Anxiety Disorder.  If you guys would get that whole don't move/breathe thing down, I'm sure he'd love you.  And I didn't *say* it, so it doesn't count. ^_^  Caramal Apple lattes very good . . .and make Dead's hands tasty.  Fatalistic is the new video game - chop, kill kick, kiss.  This makes sense, no?  And I hate that teacher. . .still, and a lot.  He's an invasion of my privacy! . . .I don't think that was what I meant.

       It was just a harmless phonecall. During the middle of the night. It woke him up and her too. At first they were alarmed. Soon after did they discover that. It was just a harmless phonecall.  It was their little one. Only he wasn't little anymore. It was quite obvious that he wasn't. They didn't care because he was always little to them. That alarmed him. It was no use, he would always be little.  It wasn't just a harmless phonecall. The only reason he called was to say goodbye. It was then that he took his life. They didn't care because he was their little one And thier little one would never do such a thing. It was no use, he would always be little in their eyes. At least in the morning they would realize that it hadn't been just a harmless phonecall.   A poem by me

      In a galaxy far far away, in a time long, long ago, there was a road runner, and he was a fucking queer! Due to this mother fucking retard I was unable to access my hotmail, which is probably overloaded with junk mail right about now. Damn road runner with its glitch. The entire internet has been gay tonight. Not only have I not been able to access anything related to or retaining the word Microsoft, but the blog wasn't working this evening either ( by this evening I mean last evening, since it's 1:14 right now). I am also having problems with columbia's PHP script engine, that thing is fucking outdated like hell...

      Turns out we have room for one last hangout, before we're swallowed by hell itself.  I love the idea of certain doom. Turns out, and asteroid's headed for Earth, and has a possibilty to hit (1/1'000.000 [sorry wrote that in European style]).  Just so you may shit your pants in the meanwhile, be sure to watch some wholesome family movies such as "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact".  Even if it will hit...it'll take it 12 years to get here....HURRY UP ALREADY!  In any fucking case, what is there to write about, when you don't do anything at all all day? Hm...well you guessed it, not much, just garbage, and empty talk. Just 44 more hrs total till I get the rest of the Trigun seires, not factoring in all the slowdowns, dl cancells, and lack of sources...in which case its more like months than hours...ridiculous really.  By the way, a George Forman Grill®  would  make an excellent addition to a dream room, especially when combined with a mini-fridge, and the rest of the crap that'll make it heaven.  I'm Deadinside, and that's my deathwish.  "She's the girl who can make all the boys cry"

      Some people blame everything on work. Oh sorry, I couldn't catch that baby because I had to go to work (on a sunday). Oh sorry, I couldn't make it to my son's graduation; my boss asked me to come into work so that I would be the only one there. There wouldn't be anyone one else there, not even the damn company mascot. Anyway I have started to move our stuff into my columbia account (and yes I have a email/web client acount with the country). If you notice the  urlLink About the staff  page has already moved. Soon I'll be adding a page there for the comics. Not only is this space free, but no ads or restrictions about how much space I can use. Yay! Anyway by the time school starts I should have the comics page up and running along with another comic! Till the next call of battle.

       *Most horrible day ever!*  Woke up this morning to a thick cloud of Roach Posion, which my mom had sprayed the night before. Due to this smog of death I was stricken with a headache for the rest of the goddamn day, not to mention I couldn't breathe properly because of the crap that I inhaled when I woke up. Following my usual routine, I went to the living room hardly able to see; when I got there, there was something very mushy under my feet. Dead Roaches, they were everywhere. After wearing slippers and returning to the living room, I found out that I had to clean up the house. So I then proceeded to go out into the damn sunlight and get the  kittens , damn you Summer Gypsy your damn post is stuck in my head (by the way, way to go), supplies that I needed. After clearing the living rooms of the dead, my mom proposed that we go to Jackson Heights. I unfortunately was forced to go with her, where she sprained her ankle and I had to help her (not an easy task). I not only helped from 181st to Jackson Heights, but from there to the temple in Flushing (God, I hate temples), and then back home. The only thing that I've had to eat all day is a loaf of Garlic Bread (lunch) and crappy temple food (dinner; God, I hate that damn temple). Yea, so you had a great day while mine was a piece of shit! P.S. Way to go with catching the kitten. P.P.S. Wednesday is good for me.

      Looks like crap has happened around here again...  That comic by Brendan sucks.  So, let's see, what's new? Nothing, that's what. And it turns out I've been attracting a bunch of losers looking for Cobain quotes to this site. Heh, I've spun a web, and caught my prey.  A few more than expected too. Actually, I didn't expect this at all, I didn't even know it was possible.  There's a way to be horrendously offensive, and its the most effective way to see the most hilarious expressions in other people's faces.  There's been a bit of a bug goin' around in our group that's been making us moody, or some shit. Glad to see Dollface's cured, but for some reason, I had some of its effects too. And here I was thinking I'm the one to be immune. I guess I'm just as human as the rest of you, and that's an odd feeling to realize...  I'm Deadinside, and you better not catch me on one of my bad days...in other words, any day...  "Spun into hell, devouring the souls of my victims. How could I damn you too? I thought I'd never lose my love"

      Yea, I finally got the comic to work. You can see it at:  urlLink Allthelilpeppypeople . There is only one strip up 'cause that is the only one that I drew. Hopefully there will be a new strip every week. It all depends on the ideas that I get from the General. Anyway I am going to add the link onto the this blog's template before I forget. The only other thing that is missing from that site is the internal blog that I wanted to include, but I'll do that later.

       a kewl new web comic  firstly, you will have to excuse my typing tonight. I spilled food on my laptop last night and the keys aren't working that well. Anyway the think that is so kewl is my friend's web comic. Many of you (by that I mean the ones that write in this blog and probably the only ones who read it) might know him, his name is Brendon. Anyway his new web comic is called  urlLink Mirth . Check it out; it is a really kewl comic. He only has his first one out.   Up is down and down is Up  The A key keeps getting stuck, same with the shift key.  The titles aren't here because this program doesn't use titles. It was cold today,real cold. The kind of cold that puts you to sleep and freezes you insides. So cold. If you believe that everything in this world is alright, they lie. For some odd reason I am both cold and warm, cold on the inside and warm as hell on the outside. I think I am sick, but I don't think that I can be cured. There are no cures, only excuses. "Oh no he didn't die of a cold, we gave him the vaccine. He died from being retarded." Excuses, the reason that the world runs as it does. Hmm... I am going to sleep now, hopefully forever.

      Anyway I just wanted to attract your attention to this, and if you are reading this, it worked. I think I shall officially name myself Lord of the Roaches. As I look around, I see them; they have surrounded me. It seems that they think that I am some sort of God or tourist attraction. I'm kidding; the roaches aren't worshiping me, but there are a quite a few of them in my house and that is an understatement.

I just did one this cold cold Sunday morning, and 'tis a lovely poem.  One of the best, if I do say so myself.  It was sort of a colaboration, or in reality, Summer thought it up, and I was in her presense and decided to take the go about, and poof, program.  I'm not sure if the last sentence made sense, but bear with me here.    Alas, the programming is calling me........

      Found something interesting.  Over the summer a contest was started in which you could win an electric guitar. But not just any guitar, it's the Jag-Stang. For those of you who do not know what this means, it's a guitar of Kurt Cobain's creation. In 1993, Kurt came to Fender  and gave them a picture of a guitar made up of other pictures cut up and put together, a combination between a Jaguar® and a Mustang® (Hence "Jag-Stang"). Of course, his was left-handed. The prize guitar is one from the original line, since it was started up again this year. To participate, you've gotta cover a Nirvana song (or 3) and send it to the girl who has the guitar. To win, you've got to have talent, which means I can't enter. Wanna know more or tell friends? The link's  urlLink here . The contest ends December 1st of this year.   The Pixies - Is She Weird     i know you're rich in good clothes and little things your mind is fancy (and your car is bitchin')  is she weird is she weird, is she white is she promised to the night and her head has no room and her head has no room  your heart is ripshit your mouth is everywhere i'm lyin' in it  is she weird is she over me like the stars and the sun like the stars and the sun is she weird is she weird, is she white is she promised to the night and her head has no room!  no more of this girl cryin' i'm here, your big man you're mine  is she weird, is she white is she promised to the night and her head has no room and her head has no room...    I'm Deadinside...I've got nothing.  "This tastes like shit"

      Posted between the reality and desire of the importance of the world, and exsistance itself. We struggle beyond it all, and needlessly worry about what we're told is important, but we really have no idea. Yet no one seems to mind. Attachment is inevitably made, yet hard to do, the bond kept, and is seemingly unbroken. Yet, at the point where permanent detachment is utterly inevitable, it seems easier than ever, and no one seems to mind...  Did you forget me already? Of course you did... There might be a special place in your heart for me... but that makes it easier to forget... Omoshiroi desune?  There's no way to cast a net of safety in this situation. It seems, we work so hard, but in the end, does it really matter? No, it does not. In fact, it never matters. No matter how you go about it, or what you do, you will always end up the same, so there's really no point. I could have tried harder, and gotten to exactly where I am, 'cept with a few different numbers here and there, but that's all. And that's not even important.  In fact, what really should be important, doesn't seem to be at all, to anyone else, that is. Close ties formed in "friendship", supposedly necessary for the quality of humanity, but completely ignored when it might be threatened. It seems that that sort of thing is what is most relevant, since everything else determined is determined as such by only trivial matters. Academia means in fact, nothing, and that would be proven if I, of all people, could advace just as much as the next person.  So, it really is all the same, and as such, continuation on that same path is completely indistinct from another, b/c the yeild is the same. And even if its not, what matters will be. What matters is love.  I'm Deadinside, and try to figure that one out.  "Hate your enemies, save your friends, find your place, speak the truth."

      Philly is a great city, especially if you are a tourist. Yea... I admit it I am a tourist, just here and now where else. I try not to be, but hell I just can't help it. The city is split into different parts kind of like New York, but these parts are labeled correctly, such as Center City is in the center; University City is where Drezel, U Penn and some other colleges are. This is the first time that I have used a computer in days; what happened to the any key?! I tried to check my mail, but CS doesn't work on these comps due to the user crap.  Over the last three days I have visited six universities, and will visit another today. Today I am going to visit Temple. The other universities are:   Villanova University:  It's a catholic univeristy, but you can't really see it besides all the crucifixes (did I spell that right). It has a nice drom, nothing really special. The campus is pretty as hell. It is a huge garden, the only draw back is that since it is some what isolated, people have to use cars to get into campus, and so there is a huge parking lot.   Swathmore:  Nothing real special; has a lot of hard classes, and that is about it. Wait... one kewl thing was all the modern art spewed across the campus.   Haverford and some other all girl college:  nothing real special, just a bunch of lesbs.   U Penn:  Great looking campus, huge. It's in the middle of a huge city and well it's like Columbia.   Drezel:  It's elementary school all over again. You have your normal asian geeks and their Prat bullies. Yea... I am not applying there...

Damn it all of you are having fun, damn it. Anyways, leaving early tomorrow morning; not taking my laptop for the ride, it's too heavy. Damn rock with a moniter! Anyways what else are you guys up to? If anyone has a lot of free time and is looking for good games for the PC; here is few titles that you might want to check out.   Homeworld 2  Call of Duty  MOHHA: Breakthrough  Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy  Tron 2.0   Tron 2.0 looks awesome, but you wouldn't understand the game unless you have seen the 80s' movie: Tron.

      Just spent the majority of the day watching Evagelion.  It's very confusing!  To top that, there are still more episodes that have not yet been made available.  But it's good...interesting...strange...any other adjectives?    Yesterday was the physics review with cookies.  All brain cells....mush....gone....complete shutdown...  But good cookies!

      Read some of his work last year in Legal Outreach; don't remember much. You really have to read deep to get the real point that he is trying to get across. In other news; I am heading out to Penn on Monday, umm... visiting a bunch of colleges. Probably going to take my laptop with me (fucking ten pound rock). So if anyone wants to play starcraft: broodwars or Warcraft II or Neverwinter Nights just IM me (tevren7891), call me if you have my number or meet me in channel HSES at like 10pm. Oh by the way guys, tell me what's on the AP Physics test. Peace out.

      And didnt he say it would be better if i and i temporary and he every man is the sum of his misfortunes and i i have committed and he didnt i tell you that some things are beyond the scope and i but i and he man is the arbiter of his own fate and i and i and he it is your choice but you have chosen wrong and i temporary and didnt he say it would be better if i and i and i . . .   And man is the sum of his misfortunes - of physics and books that he has tried too hard to read and what does it all amount to I wonder?  This has been brought to you by an overdose of  The Sound and the Fury , by William Faulkner.  and i i have committed man is the sum of his own fate

      Not to mention the pinnacle of a thirsty eve. Leave me alone to my careless usage of the english language.  More than enough, was it ever? I dunno. You know, I never thought I'd see the day when lil' Dollface went out and tried the weed. Kinda surprising..tho..not really. I dunno how you managed to kill that high, that's pretty weird, and it sounds like your brother-in-law'd know if it were bad weed. Oh well, maybe some other time you'd get a good high.  Nothin' more than I loveley bore, and what's more I got to eat stuff for this gluttonous, bloody holiday (and I can't spell).  Since I haven't got many words to say, I'll just fill this up with some news you probably could care less about, here we go!  Crapasscartoons'll have some more cartoon up soon, we've got the animations on the drawing board, but Owens does the flash animations and uploads them on the site, and he's like seriously ill, so that's delayed. If you care at all, then just know that that one cartoon isn't gonna be the only one up there forever. And uhh...let's see...what else....oh right.  I have a real problem about that hate mail thing...THERE IS NONE!! Why won't any one send any hate mail?! If you're a little scared about letting me know how much you hate me, don't be! That's what it's there for! If you EVER have a need to express your hatred for me, or for Owens...or I guess even Anar, just send the mail!! C'MON PEOPLE!! SEND ME YOUR HATE!! I NEED TO KNOW YOU HATE ME!!!  Anyway, mid-way through this rant, one of those waves of writing inspiration, or some shit, came through me, Summer calls it "stream of consciousness"? Sure, anyway, I'm bored, so, even though you might not care...well I don't care...    the writing that used to be here was removed for being too stupid    Figure it anyway you want. I'm Deadinside, and I REALLY like cranberries...I leave you with that...  "You've had waaay to much to smoke. I think I see some marijuana growin' out of your ears."

      My friend was telling me of this site that had parodies and whatnot...SO FUNNY.  To persue you guys to go to the site, I'll tell alittle of what I saw...  The title was "Rise of the Mushroom Kingdom"  It's at the end of the site.  It's starts of with Mario dying after being blasted with these huge bombs.  Then Luigi and Yoshi plot and take revenge.  Very bloody, and very funny.  If that doesn't spark your curiosity, I don't know what will. it's at   urlLink http://www.videogamedc.com/Pixeled_Parodies

      For all those who are LOTR fans and wanna learn new stuff, here is a couple of sites:  urlLink khazad-dum : a great plae to learn about dwarves and their language. for all you orc lovers (yay!):  urlLink Orc Nation : a very good place to learn blackspeak. No not the language of black people. If you think I am being racist, try searchin blackspeak on  urlLink google . All you get are sites about ebonics. Anyway, Blackspeak is the language of orcs. Anyway, I found something else that cracked me up. Remember the  urlLink Fanta  (by the way, its from the  urlLink Netherlands , at least I think so. I couldn't find the english version of the site), well... There is an  urlLink Indian  version, called  urlLink Maxala . I saw the commercial today on  urlLink Zee-TV  (the hindi channel). It was so stupid, even worse than the Fanta ones.  The were a couple of guys bowling, and all of a sudden, these chicks came out of nowhere! WTF??!!  Peace out...

Well look no further,  urlLink IO2Technologies  has developed the worlds first screenless monitor.  They had to take down their demo videos because their bandwidth usage was getting to high, but the  urlLink screenshots  are still up.

      hehehehehe... Ice Tea... Hehehehe. Anyway I have decided that I don't like people with baggy clothing. Really, why would you wear pants that are large enough to be classified as blankets. If you are wondering why I am talking about this... Well wonder no more. Today I went to  urlLink Modells . The reason I went there was to get some cargo pants that they had been carrying for years. This year though, there were no normal pants. The things were huge. A couple, I think medium or large, were about my hieght, I could literally fall into them and no one would find me for years. I am not even that short... maybe I am, but still pants legs that are 5 feet long? No fucking way! I saw some other kid too, he was swimming in those things. Why would you wear those pants? It's a waste of material, you could have made at least another pair out of the extra fabric. Then there are the patches on the pants... Those useless patches.   'Oh look at me, I am so poor and ghetto because I put patches on my pants, even though they weren't ripped or anything. I am cool right? right guys?'  Those people are lucky that I was wasted and didn't freak out.

      Lady, I admit it - Hugh Jackman is *hot*.  He was just in this public television showing of Oklahoma! with curly hair and overalls and shirtless *faints*.  I love that play, by the way.  It's a good play - Judd scares me, though.  In other news . . .well, there really isn't any.  I got leather gloves!!  And they're lined!  Oh, and I found this hysterical, Sedgie:  Top Ten Worst Pick-up Lines of All Time:  1. "What's your sign?" The epitome of cheese, this line, which has been around since the Beatles came to America, ranks as the very worst line in dating history. The fact that it's still in use says a lot about the decay of our society's standards and the glaring desperation of some singles.  *grins*  Want to go to Ray's Pizza?

      i've just woken up...i feel dead?  lol strange how i'm not even sure.  So i'm supposed to be going to museum today - so lazy.  I should be getting ready NOW but something is keeping me from doing so.  I've been gluing myself to the computer doing bullshit things...mostly looking at sony vaio notebooks ~_~ ooooo i can dream cant i? hehe...and looking at the weather site for about 15 times as IF saying to myself i AM getting a lil ready.  i'm supposed to call up addie too...but not too sure why?  i'm going to the museum to see my mentor..addie's just gonna be at the museum....was she implying to hang out?  or was she gonna join me with my mentor????  i'm so dead; i can barely open my eyes.  i wish i had magic powers.  i could orb myself around *grin* that way i wouldnt have to bother with stupid transportation and stupid male harrassers.  I really should start getting a permit...but then....what use is a car in the city unless ur going to be driving around in queens or something.  i'm really just blabbing rite now..i really dont wanna go!! but i have to.  something about a stupid contest i have to participate in and the deadline is this wed i think...i've been doing this experiment studying kids and all....i've done it maybe 3 times this whole month and the times i have gone I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M LEARNING OUT OF IT....so i'm gonna have to figure out some way to bullshit on what i studied and found out on the application.  this is the only reason i'm coming in today, so mentor can help me what to write.  it's so nice being able to type fast....cuz then u  type more....ahhh i'm really out of it.  but i dont wanna goooooo...and stupid braces...sigh...broken already...watch...i'm gonna have them longer than 3 months.  having a laptop would be nice but i fear this will only lead to more hours of laying on my bed being a lazy bastard and days of leaning towards procrastination.  bah - 11:30 already...i woke up at 10ish and time went by so fast.  seriously....wish i could orb lol.  maybe i should take a shower to wake me up.  i should get a job...yes

      Yea, I was home all night, mostly by myself. Since I can't cook I was forced to eat live roaches...kidding. Anyway I heated up some hot water and started to make some of those japanese-big-bowl-cup-of-noodles. "Nong Shim's Bowl Noodle Soup: Picante flavor" was the label... I don't know what happened. Maybe when they translated Hot&Spicy from english to spanish to forgein asian, and then to english it turned from Hot&Spicy to Hot&Spicy with some crap on top and some fake vegatables. Now if you think I am going overboard with this... You are wrong. The Onion was a small piece of plastic with purple lines. Now I have  headache and my stomach feels woozy. Wait... I just read the label, this piece of crap is a product of Korea. Damn Koreans.

      Well, there was a lot of the good brown liquidy stuff, with sugar, and more sugar, and more sugar.  Then there were those swedish fish that is made up of essentially sugar.  Needless to say, I had a good time in English today.  Bored, but good time.  The one bad thing about the hyperness is the sleepiness(? sentence doesn't seem to make sense) that follows up.    And that's true, Ron is Harry Potter's bitch.  But we all knew that.  And he doesn't shut up with the whining.    Currently, I'm listening to some annoying commercial on the radio about a brand of cheese.  Apparently it's good on bread and good anytime.  MAKE IT STOP!!!

I saw the movie today,  urlLink Harry Potter  and the.... well its the second one. In all the scenes, Ron is basically the bitch and Harry is always pimp smacking the kid around. I felt kinda sorry for him... since he had to be the bitch. Harry was a fucking dick. Damn he was a fucking cock. Wow... This post won't be able to be seen by the school comps.

      If anyone ever wants to play starcraft: broodwars, I am your man. i play everyday after 9:00pm (EST). Played a great game last night with a couple of asian guys from school. We played the Fastest Money Map. I got my ass beat down the first time (2v2). The next game I came back and lasted untill the end when Gary finished me off with on quick hit (FFA). Anyway, It was really fun. By the way, Umm... I was suppose to write something here, but I can't think of anything to put here.   my movie reviews:   urlLink The Matrix: Revolutions    Well to start off, I thought the movie would be about the matrix. Now for a movie about the matrix, there certainly not enough of it, max 15-20 minutes.  The fact that the craft that they are using doesn't get struck down by the lighting kills me.  The kid in the ACU , when he walk to open the gate... Oh my god! It looks like an obese person running to the donut shop, only slowed down.  ...well I won't give this part away (nice of me isn't, now that I have already ruined this much of the movie).The only thing I have to say: "what happened?"  Then there is the fact that there was less theology and more bad action scenes and lets-try-to-make-Neo-Jesus scenes.  To hit it home, the fight scene between Neo and Smith sucks so much! It's the same as the last ones, only this time they added rain/time stopping effects.  I agree that the first Matrix (2000) was a great movie, but it got worse, I can stand the second one ( just saw it on my comp), but the third one was just a kick in the balls. Anyway, die-hard fans might enjoy it. It's not worth ten bucks, maybe rent or download.

      Well, okay, *kind of*. . . This is how you know you've seen *waaaayyy* too many episodes of Star Trek: TNG.  And by way too many I mean the most adorable creature right now is Hue.  Really - sadly, the most lovable thing around right now. (For those of you fellow aficionados - and by that, I mean *geeks* - I was watching I, Borg and Descent part I and II.)  He's a little mechanical but he's so *sweet*. . . .Of course, LadyN and I are still the (apparently) conjoined lesbian couple of the hour, but who knows?  If we discover warp drive maybe things will change. ^_^  Talent show was awesome, lots of noise, lots of fun.  We're Allan's groupies!!  His band kicked serious ass, by the way, as did Quentin and Hadrien in their band.  And sadly sadly . . . .white/chinese/whatever people really, just, can't dance.  *sigh*  Peace love and cockatoos!

      I can't really express myself fully on this webpage. See I just found out that the school's proxy will let us view this site as long as we don't curse too much. If anyone read that letter that I written to Menwa you would see me expressing myself. Well I tried to view that at school, everything up till that post showed up. After that post, it gave me some  bullshit  excuse me, please Mr/Ms/Mrs. Proxy (I don't discriminate) don't block it,  about there being too many  cuss  profane words in the post. Anyway, I've been playing that  urlLink KoC  thing, it pretty interesting once you get into it, but the only problem is that they are running PHP and MySQL on two servers and there are about 170,000 people or so. Those puny servers can't handle it. One good thing is that there aren't any spammers or anything like that.  Life is going well and sober. I almost given up on those damn comics cause  urlLink keenspace  sucks  dick  I mean dock. It sucks a lot of docks...  Damn  it I am a  fucking  failure.  Shit!

      I don't really have much to say... Um.... I am talking to people and they are saying stuff... Truly the only thing I can say, is that you all should go to:  urlLink Join Tevren's Army . You can join daily, no need to create an account, just follow the link until it says that you are fighting on my side. Anyway, this was suppose to be my "redesign website" weekend, but it has ended up as play KoC (Kings of Chaos) weekend. I am trying to catch up to the General, need some more troops and some turns so that I can overtake other people. Anyway, join my army.

      You're damn right, sure wasn't the same without you Dollface. Seems things seem kinda empty without you around. In any case, I really hope you're feelin' better, hope it wasn't too serious. Could I expect to see you in school today?   In other stuff, Owens and I have opened a very stupid site, that will be filled with ver stupid cartoons...I must stress the words... VERY STUPID . If you think you can handle it, or are just curious to see how goddamn stupid/mentally deficient we are, go ahead, the link's right  urlLink here .  I've straightened my hair, I look like a young Kurt Cobain with brown, slightly wavyer hair, and maybe some beatles hairstyle mixed in a little there. I can't leave it this way, at least I'm doubtful, don't expect to see this anytime soon.  I'm Deadinside, and I am too damn tired.  "I'm just a wreck without...my china girl.

      Hey Dollface, hope that you are feeling better today, and that you come to school tomorrow. It wasn't the same without you. So whatcha do today during your sick time? The comic still isn't updating, so I'm thinking about reseting it. Hopefully it doesn't come to that. I was playing this awesome game of Starcraft tonight, until I lost. I was playing with Josh, it was us against three comps, and they beat us into a corner, I tried to defend and attack back. They eventually broke my defense when I decided to go Archon. It wasn't worth it. That was that. Last few words: Yo Menwa, I read your mail and saw the pics, they were great. Yo I am redesigning this site soon, wanna help me? -Peace Out from The Box Under The Bridge

      I tried to update the comic yesterday, but it didn't seem to work. I'm still trying tonight, so if any of you find me unresponsive, that's the reason. The third strip will be up next tuesday. I'll probably uniform the site design this weekend, so if you experience some problems, that's the reason. Repetative clause isn't it. Anyway I'm going to get back to work now.

Yo how didya hit up this site man? Yo send me the link for any of your sites so that I can put them on the link bar. For all of you who are wonder who Menwa is, he is my friend who graduated two years ago. Some of you might remember him. He runs COTRM, the link on the side bar, but it doesn't seem to be working. I learned a lot of my web site skills from him. I'll post up the links for his site once I find out what they are. He is a fucking genius.

      Did you know that Blogger now lets us use spellcheck, it's the first option on the bar. With this new option I no longer have to do this:  clacskdfhlas . Anyway there are some other kewl features cuch as the draft thing, but  I don't know how to use it. Now there is even this email feature, but its pretty useless, it tells you if your blog has been published. I mean isn't that what the little publish thing on the right hand side is for?

      ahh, don't think you'll haveta worry about stuff like that psychology stuff and thinking scientifically, dollface. If any one can do it, well then you can. As for that whole college thing, I actually thought about taking a year off before I went if I decided to go, too.  Sorry if this blog seems bland or my thoughts seem unorganized, I've got a little in my system. Just sitting here reading what you people haveta say gets my stomach wrenching with some type of anxiety I haven't felt in a while, b/c right now, it's all on the surface, since its the drop. Head's pounding a bit, but it might just be my imagination. I still can't shake that eerie feeling from me...like someone taking my intestines, squeezing them, then tying them into a know, then wraping them around my heart, as it strains under the pressure, giving me images of every one being lost in their own confusion and I can't help but think that I might've been the cause or maybe even contributed the dosage of doubt needed.  So all I'll do is be...yeah...thats it...and take it in. I'll just hear what you have to say and observe you, that way, nothing'll affect me, and I can't affect you.   Yeah, going away to college would be nice, but personally, even though I do know you, I can't really see the whole party girl thing...dunno.  Still dunno who American Hi-Fi is, but, they sure don't sound that good. Must be my prejudice and ironic closed-mindedness.   It's a lot to take in...all at once...heh....I can still laugh...it is kinda funny...but then I feel my heart squeeze again...its an odd sensation...there it goes again.  I'm Deadinside, I haven't spoken to myself so honestly in such a long time.  "On the brink of insanity, it is but a narrow bridge."

      so i cant even remember when i last posted....have a massive migraine right now and pain killers dont work.  i am doing everything to postpone revising that theban essay for english such as posting here.  so today was a decent day...went out to the museum...joined a seminar with graduate psychologists....so i've realized...psychology is haaaaaard....having a bit of trouble having the scientific way of thinking....have to be so detailed and OBVIOUS with everything.  my partner is taking a break from the museum now so i'm stuck doing the experiment alone which is not good for me cuz i panic and i have a horrible way of remembering and putting things into words and questions.  i am starting to wonder if i really want to get out of the city...i dont kno anymore.  but to get away from parents would be nice...i so would be a party girl....but then again....most people that dont know me think i'm quiet, shy and CALM! hehe...o well.  i cant wait for a holiday break.....i think we all need one.  i've always wanted a year off of school before going to college but i think my parents would kill me...going away is already freaking them out.  so la la la...cant think of anything else to write....i suppose i could mess around with my college essay instead.....but this migraine bothering me.....i'm not even sure if its a migrain or not but my whole head hurts - from my forehead all the way back to my neck. blah.  maybe candy will make me feel better.    as ever - dollface!

        Teenage Alien Nation by American Hi-Fi  I want it all, no matter what You thought you heard me say, no matter what You know you can't escape today Is there any other way?  And so what, if you don't like me I don't give a fuck If you don't like me I could change my luck It seems I'm gettin rotten to the core  Forget about tomorrow You and me, we're going down in sorrow The youth of the nation, going nowhere Station to station, Teenage Alien Nation The Teenage Alien Nation yeah  It's all wrong I guess the summer must have come and gone I guess we kinda shoulda known it all along We're never going anywhere  And sometimes, you've gotta pick it up And roll the dice, no lookin' back And man you don't think twice about Feeling lonely every day   Yea, hope you like that. It's a really good song. Anyway I haven't posted in a long time. I been working on the comic, so you know... been lazy. Anyway besides that, I have had to consider what college I want to go to. Now they tell me that your average actually matters and that if you don't go to college you'll end up as some worthless bum-shield for some rapist cop. The new comic will be up tomorrow, nothing special, still experimenting with my style. Till later. P.S. I'll try to post once every day or something.

      I don't know what the hell that was suppose to mean. Anyway, I am learning my Pentatonic Minor Scales now. Fun shit, my neighbor lent me his metranome (god I hate it, so annoying). I'll put a recording of my scales up later... It's pretty nice...can't come up as well though. Today's been pretty usual.  urlLink Did you know about the snake they found in Indoneasia , it supposely 49 feet in length and over 950 pounds. They have to feed it four to five dogs a month. Just for the record the longest snake in the world recorded up till now was 32 feet long and 402 pounds. Maybe they made a mistake, but maybe it's true. Too bad for the snake, at least it'll get some free food, maybe they'll even feed the snake some of those bratty little white chicks that Dollface hates so much.

      It's the coming of a new year!

Have been sick for the last 4 days.  It's kind of weird, each day with different symptoms and still am not sure which day l liked the best.  The whole sickness is kind of ironic considering the title of the post.  Swear I put the title in before typing anything else!  Till later

      Just kidding.  Umm... Red birds fly over the Horizon. Oh yea, just try to juggle that one. Anyway I started reading Don Quixote De La Mancha by Cervantes. Great book, flows really well and is funny. It's not so funny that its cheap literature but enough to make me giggle like a little school girl. Anyways the I am at like page 100 out of 800 someodd. Yea, I have a long ways to go. So if you don't hear from me, its cause I'm reading. It's funny how crazy people are treated in the book, just go along with it until the kook is far far away, or beat the crazy bastard silly. I am suppose to compare this to Hamlet, so if you have any pointers, just buzz me. Other books that I am reading include:  Unfinished Tales by J.R. Tolkien.  Closing Time By Joseph Heller (I never really read this one seriously, just pick it up occasionally).  The Revenge Of The Latchkey Kids by Ted Rall (great political cartoonist).  Random Comic books, mostly DC and a bit of Image.  Try them, they are pretty good reads. The Tolkien one not so much unless your into that really descriptive stuff, like the hieght of the mountain and how many trees grow there and how many orcs have taken a crap there.

      Well, as some of you who are in the filesharing scene might know, KaZaA Lite K++ is slowly becoming obsolete. Since its based on an old core, its easy for Sharman Networks to close out all of its users and eliminate it from its system. Clean KaZaA 2.6 is looking to be the light of the future, but slow progress, and reluctant users, still loyal to K-Lite aren't too keen on moving on to this new "Lite"prog. So who will take KaZaA's place as the King of p2p? Limewire's network is big, to say the least, but Aqualime, it's "lite" version probably won't be around forever, and just 'cause it's a bit network, doesn't mean it's all that great, or even that fast, comparatively. Seems that progs like Shareaza and eMule are climbing the p2p ladder, taking advantage of the greatest filesharing network, Gnutella2. WinMX is also a huuuge player, and was one of the first fleeing Napster users ran to back in 2000. Its network is large, fast, and highly diverse, as users are forced to share, more or less, to get more results on their searches. Even with all these rising competitors, the RIAA can still try to find you, even if they don't know about all these p2p progs. What will ultimately decide the true king, is how much security the network can provide. If you can be safe from the RIAA, that's your winner.  On to other interests, don't you find it WONDERFUL when cashiers at places like Sears, or....other dept. stores, pretty much anywhere, express a complete disregard for the customer's hurry? In fact, they like taking their sweet-ass time when there's like 50 disgruntled customers on the line, and the one at the counter's OBVIOUSLY in a hurry, and only has a few items in front of them. I seriously believe that the people who hire cashiers turn away people who are too qualified. And by that I mean, if you can move as fast as the average human being. If you're as slow as goddamn fat cow, chewing on fodder, you're fine. If you have the IQ of a toenail clipping, even better. You don't NEED to know how to work the register! Its ok if you can't find the bar code, blatantly posted, large as life, on one whole side of the product, after searching all sides BUT that side, for a full minute. LOVE it when they hold back the rest of your items, just cause ONE hasn't been price-cheked yet!  The Simpsons: Hit & Run is a KICK-ASS game....seriously man....awesome.  I'm Deadinside...or, more recently, Death-Boy! ...away I go!  "Oh no! My insides!!...they're....outside!!"

Not really hungry though, about to sleep felt that  I had to rant or do something before my system gave up. Dollface, so you saw the Return of the King (not going to bother with the link cause everyone know what it is). How was it? Umm....How is that Harmonica thing going?  There once was a man named Steve Steve did what he wanted When he pleased Why sometimes he peed in the street  All was good for Steve Everything was sunny and free Until he pissed off this bulldog And it bit off his knees Now Steve can't get out his chair He finds it hard to get up and down stairs The funny thing is that no one cares.  Steve no longer takes strolls or saunters in the park or piss in the places that are dark Now he just sits in his chair Trying to reach for the pretty nurse's hair  Now Steve can't piss in streets Or any other place that he sees Poor Steve, Poor Steve Stuck in a chair Too bad nobody really cares.

      Further notes on the entire media player thing...   I forgot to metion this earlier, but iTunes is just a music player, that's it, nothing else. Umm... Lets see what else did I have to say about iTunes... Oh yea, don't mess with the programming, esp in the libary files cause it will fuck you up.  Winamp 5 or whatever they said that was really nice and should get (by they I mean the development team) sucks a lot of man penis. The update on the thing that Deadinside was talking about, that make its use less memory, well I haven't seen it. In other words it eats p00p.  The best bet up till now, and this is just my opinion, is Winamp 2.8. The only problem is that it isn't visble on their site anymore.  Now to things that are actually interesting... I hate Kin, oh my god. Why? Don't ever play any game with him. When he starts to lose, he comes up with an exucse. Hey my probes stopped collecting minerals After he loses, he comes up with an excuse. Okay now its my turn. (wants to make u believe that his brother was playing instead of him)  Man... Pisses me off, if this was just once or twice I wouldn't mind, but everytime!

      Firstly I found this cute picture on the  urlLink New York Times  website.     Secondly I made a little skit that I should really not share because it just goes to show that I am clinically insane.  The worst thing that you can say at a funeral guy1: So... was she any good in bed? guy2: She was my grandmother! guy1: Oh...Oh...ummm....did you ever play those strange hideNseek goes wrong games with her? guy2: DUDE! She was my grandmother, and I loved her (in a plutonic way). I just wish that she was still here. What the hell is wrong with you? guy1: Man, if you loved her so much, why don't you stuff her and put her in the living room... you're going to hit me now aren't you. ::stare at each other for a moment:: guy2: Yes. Yes, I am. ::guy2 smacks guy1 upside his head::  Oh by the way for all of you who are looking to for a good mp3 player for your desktop, try  urlLink iTunes . It's pretty good. The best part of it is that it organizes your music into all these little catagories and for all you 'legal eagles' you can download your music 'legally' with it. The worst part of iTunes is the AAC formating. The encryption makes it immpossible to make mp3s and to put mp3s on mp3 players (except iPods). Don't be bummed out, there is a bug in the program that you can crack and well not have your music be AAC encypted. I don't personally know how to, but it is explained  urlLink here  (the links there will also lead you to places that show you how). In my personal experience, iTunes was wonderful. The reasons for this being that my mp3s are on another computer and so when i access them over my network, iTunes can't encrypt them. I also don't download music or burn music using iTunes, so well no encryption there. I am still grey on this AAC, I don't think it applies if you don't use iTunes for burning or downloading. I can still burn all my music that I listened to, in fact I just did. I also messed with the some of the libary files that iTunes came with, and that's another reason why it didn't do anything to my music. Please don't do what I did because after a week my iTunes stopped working, and everytime I download it, it still doesn't work. Oh well, I'll just stick to my Winamp 2.8 and Nero 5.0. Overall iTunes is a good music player (it organizes wonderfully), and it can be better if you crack it... Not that I am telling you to...

      Hehehe, firstly the guy's name is Bush... That just opens him for countless jokes. Not to say that he isn't competent, not at all. He is all politics, all votes and all richie rich. By that last one I mean that he is all for producing cash, the only thing is that he isn't thinking about the environment or the poor people. A good example would be New York City, over the last two years the rich have gotten richer, but the middle class has started to disappear. Bush's hope with this is that the upper class's wealth will tricke down the economic prymiad. Not really working. Whenever I imagine the president, I imagine a little boy who has made a huge mess in his parents room, but manages to hide everything under their bed so that the don't notice. When the parents come to check up on him, they see how productive he is and give him some candy. That's the way that Bush is. I mean he has made a mess domestically and internationally, but right when he would be punished (right when Dean was becoming popular) they find Saddam. It's very strange. I think that they knew where Saddamn was for at least a month. The only reason they didn't capture him before is that he was their trump card. Right when reelection became a hot topic and Dean became popular, Bamm! They played the trump card and Bush is back on the top of the polls. Not many americans know what is actually happening overseas many don't even know what Saddam has done wrong or where their troops are fighting.  Hmm.... My opinion is that I hate and admire the Bush adminstration for their sneakiness, and that the Democrats have no chance of winning. In fact they have negative chances, they owe chances to win to Bush. BURN THE BUSH!!

      It's Christmas Eve, and I'm shivering in my own little Ossining corner, sick with food (and this is just the beginning) and on to wish you all a very Merry Christmas . . .I'd wish you a Merry something else, but all the other holidays are kind of past, I think.  In a few moments I'll be sucked into the whirling vortex that is my family - not that it hasn't happened yet, as I got home yesterday a few moments before my mother dragged a tree up the stairs by herself and installed it in my apartment . . .I mean *our* apartment.  But that's beyond the point.  The point is, my dear friends and lovers, to wish you all the best holiday break every, and to talk to you as soon as I can come back.  Merry Christmas!

      Hello, all you bastards. I'm back again, and fear me....c'mon...fear me!...oh....c'mon...pleeeease? Oh...you're no fun.  Anyway, rumors goin' 'round 'bout that pesky WINAMP 5, turns out, there's a "Final" version comin' out that's yet tyo be announced. Its already appeared over .torrent, and its major improvement should be enough of an incentive to make you download it. Appareantly, the idiots noticed that it eats up a LOOOT of your system resources, sooo, they've released a "Final" version, which alleviates this frustrating problem. The  urlLink Winamp homepage  should be updated soon, dun worry, the release is indeed official.  If anyone has any memory, what-so-ever, they would remember I made a post a while back about a contest held on the  urlLink Internet Nirvana Fan Club  homepage where you could win a Jag-Stang if you covered a Nirvana song and sent it in to the person who owns the guitar. Well, I don't care if you don't, the contest has been on hold since Nov. 29 th because the guitar's owner has given no response to any e-mails or the like and has been deemed "unvailable." Sucks for the people who sent their shit in, the contest was s'posed to be over Dec. 1st, but these people are gonna haveta wait. Maybe it was a ll a scam? Who knows. I'd like to get my hands on that Jag-Stang...  For the immature little pervert in all of us, and for a few good laughs, check out  urlLink this page . Click the button, and laugh or get weirded out, then click for more! Here's an example: "Grappling the bologna pony"  I'm Deadinside, and Happy Whatever-you-celebrate/believe-in!

      Man I really have nothing good to say... I do have some not so good, but still pleasent stuff to address. First of all HAPPY HOLIDAYS! That was just for those of you who celebrate this stuff. For the rest go crawl into some damp hole somewhere... No really I mean it. Actually I don't... Something is going to blow right up in my face, I can feel it. Last night I didn't really get that much sleep. It could've been because of my mom's snoring, perhaps it was the fact that I didn't listen to NELMPA. Man did I screw that one in the ass, it was like doing a donkey or a donkey doing you. That could have been my mom's snoring too... Anyway, strike one, and and I am still at bat. "Hope the govermen' don' comw' afta' mah teef." Wish me luck and basketballs.

      No, I am really asking. Have you seen the stars at night? Aren't they great. Sometimes I think that they might be stars on earth, and I don't mean the hollywood kind. I mean people. Then not so long after I find that most of these earth stars share something in common with their alien cousins. Both are radioactive, by this I mean that If you get too close you'll get burned. I don't like getting burned. My hands are burned, so is my forehead. I've had enough of these stars. No longer will I be burned. I've decided that the best way to interact with stars is in a lawn chair looking at the sky. All those who have been burned before should realize that it is impossible. Maybe you will have better luck in the future where there are more stars in a smaller area where they can get ride of their heat easier. I'm not taking that chance, too many burns. Too many burns. I'll be back later to post the latest world and US news...

      Let's all try to dance and be happy!...hah, I didn't even believe that one. Alright, for the pure lack of anything to do or say, I've come up with a list of the 27 essential songs of all time, even though some of you might not agree with them (actually, if you have any suggested songs, tell me.) In any case, here they are, from the past 60 or so years, 27 of the greatest songs:  1. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana, (this is basically a bit unfair, and a somewhat over-milked song, but it was a defining moment in music history.) 2. "Fire" by Jimi Hendrix (Among many, this one, Purple Haze, and Stone Free stand out, so do way too many more) 3. "I Wanna be Your Dog" by The Stooges (The song that made them famous, followed by...) 4. "Gimme Danger" by Iggy & the Stooges (the song on the album that faded them out of exsistence, this song is widely known as a punk anthem) 5.  "Sunshine of Your Love" by Cream (Awesome song, amongst many more powerful hits by Cream) 6. "Blind" by KoRn (THE definition of KoRn's potential, sad they had to throw it all away) 7. "Imagine" by John Lennon (Communist brainwashing? A genius's vision for a perfect world? Whatever it was, there's no one out there who hasn't heard of it!) 8. "Iron Man" by Black Sabbath (appearing on the Album "Paranoid" everyone from NOFX to rap artist Busta Rhymes, or however you spell that...) 9. "Runaway" by Del Shannon (thought to be a one-hit wonder, this rocketed the young Del Shannon to stardom, but since he was know for just this song forever, and due to some other problems, he commited suicide!) 10. "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" by Leadbelly 11. "I Love Rock & Roll" by Joan Jett and the Sex Pistols 12. "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire" by the Ink Spots (highly influential Jazz group, with their share of troubles) 13. "Wherever I May Roam" by Metallica 14. "If I Think" by Mudhoney (The song that ties grunge together, as Kurt Cobain put it) 15. "Where is My Mind?" by The Pixies (This song, and the album it was on "Surfer Rosa" let the world know something big was comin', and they were right) 16. "Venus in Furs" by The Velvet Underground (This and the entire album its on "The Velvet Underground & Nico" was a shame for the group, since no one understood the cover, but after they gained fame, all of the entire album began selling like crazy) 17. "Return of the Rat" by The Wipers (The Wipers' first album "Is this Real?" and their step into histoy, covered by many famous artists all over) 18. "Turning Japanese" by The Vapors (You interpret this song however you like) 19. "She's the One" by The Ramones 20. "Kill Your Idols" by Sonic Youth 21. "Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison 22. "Crazy Train" by Ozzy Osbourne 23. "Clandestino" by Manu Chao (His first album [I think] since the break up of the band "La Mano Negra", and its not a disappointment) 24. "Sweet Child O' Mine" by Guns N' Roses 25. "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin 26. "Night Goat" by The Melvins 27. "Backwater" by The Meat Puppets  I'm Deadinside, this'll take up a lot of space...whoops...  "That's when you know, you're too asleep to care"

      I am so pissed off. First of all  urlLink Winamp  decided to come out with Winamp 5. There are so many reasons for why this is wrong. Firstly, there was no Winamp 4, only Winamp 3. How the hell are you going to skip a number?! It really pisses me off. Next, it takes up so much memory that to run it you would need a super-computer, and let me tell you even my mod has trouble using it. One principle of winamp which made it work, probably the only principal that made it work was that it was free. Not just one version, but all the versions. Now Winamp 5 has gone and changed that. One version of Winamp 5 is free and the other (the one with CD burning and other crap) is not. How degrading, I hope that now they feel like  urlLink Realplayer , those damn bastards. I now predict that the programmers of Winamp will never be able to look in the mirrors for reasons   Out of pure shame.  because I would have already gauged their eyes out by then.  Besides that today has been like crap with crap on the side and some more crap for dessert. Never allow me to plan anything, I will so do it up the ass that it isn't even funny. One simple thing, how could it have gone awry in so many ways. ARRRGGGG!! Till later when I am not as pissed off at your couch's face!  **more crap just happened! Somehow the columbia server messed up my SQL code so I have to fix that so that people can see the About the Staff page. I hate this crap

      Man what a day Friday was... First I hung out with the 1337 of 133757. My brother, a bunch of his friends, a bunch of his friends' friends and me (don't worry I knew all of them...infact they are kinda like my friends) went to see LOTR: The Return Of The King. The theater that we went to had the best seats ever! These things rocked, literally. They rocked back and forth. On a side note, if you guys are wondering which theater, it's the LOEWS on 34th and 7th ave. Good times. The Return of the Kings wasn't the best out of all three. I think that it has already being brought up that the movie is 3 and half hour long. My ass started to hurt by the end. But it didn't matter because it was worth all that time, besides they make sure that the movie kept you really interested. At no point did I want to yawn or turn away. The only problem that I had with the movie was that it wasn't true to the book as the others. That's probably because it was already really long, so I can't wait till the extended edition comes out and I can see the cut out scenes. Anyway After the movie, Goldberg and his friends wanted to go eat some sushi, so the rest of us followed them up a block. After realizing that the sushi place was nowhere near 34th street, we asked where he was going. The answer: "to st.Marx's for sushi, it's half off." That is just competely fucked up, he wanted us to go downtown to the villiage (damn villiage) so that we could get rotten raw fish, not just raw fish, but that crap that they sell for half off. Anyway we ended up going to Popeye's (yea i know it isn't that much better, but hey atleast it was close by). That was my friday!

      Wooooow,  that's a loooot of stuff I missed. So many posts in like the two days or so, mostly long ones. And I even came here yesterday, and those posts failed to appear. Anyway, how did so many of you see LotR already? Wasn't that that movie we were all gonna go see? Ah, well, I might just be hallucinating, I dunno, not important.  Well now, kiddies, the very happy holidays, as we're told they are, are comin' up, and aren't we all just so excited? We're really in that jeudo-christian, gift-giving, merry mood, now aren't we? That long and painfully amusing post, is an example of why Sedgewick (?) should post more often, and of the basic gist of all of our moods.  To help lighten things up around here, I know most of us, or at least some, are involved the ever popular p2p file-sharing trend, that's been around since about '97. So, we might get a little paranoid, a little worried, now and again. "Am I gonna get sued?", "Are they gonna get me if I download too much music/movies/pornography?", "Am I gonna wake up with a horsehead on my pillow and an RIAA member hanging over my bed, supoena in one hand, rectum-probing tool in the other?!"  Thankfully, unless you're into that kinda thing, these kinds of threats, may become just a distant memory.   urlLink An article on Zeropaid.com  recently reported a major blow to the bastards at the RIAA. While they might still be able to get to you, it has been ruled that obtaining the identities of file-sharers, particularly in the way the RIAA has tried to do, is a bit..wrong. They will not be allowed to directly obtain users' information from ISP's or from tracking programs as easily as they could before. In fact, they'll have to go thorugh a bunch of crap just to get to you, and then file a suit and etc, wasting a lot of money. Read the full story in the link provided.  So, for some of us, getting arrested will happen less, and for the rest, maybe not at all for the time being. Anyway, yeah those SAT II's were kinda crap, I only managed to complete the Biology one, leaving behind 16 Math IC questions due to the time, and f lil off my writing essay. Oh well, its not like it matters anyway.  I'm Deadinside, and THEY'RE WATCHING YOU!!  "Never be satisfied unless your on top, or....no...it's more satisfying if you're on to--NO!...uhhh..never be satisfied, until you get on top...to the top....um....DAMMIT!"

      Lord of the Rings!!!  Just saw it today!  SOOO LONG!  That was the one bad thing about it.  It just wouldn't end!  Everytime you think it's about to...nope!  Just some insides about the movie, without spilling everything...of course, Legolas has his one ultra-awesomely cool fight/action scene (with a combination of about 20 lines or so in the entire movie).  The best!  So freakin' awesome.  Words simply can't describe.    And then there were the SAT II's today.  It was so weird, I kept finishing before everyone else.  When I was done with all the questions, I had about 10 minutes left, and I was thing....."um.....this can't be good."  The math was pissed me off so much.  Whenever I skipped a question, I would forget, and fill in that space for the next question.  I realized around 3 questions afterwards and had to fix it.  BUT, it happened more than once, oh no, guess how many.....like 5.  Yeah, I know, slow!  The literature was soo incredibly boring.  When I was using the prep book, they actually had some pretty interesting stories, but not this time.  And it was pretty difficult, which sucked!  (Oh, the events being posted are not in order.) Skateboarded after the movie and was a blast.  My friend has this HUGE one; it's up to my nose.  But really easy to turn in and really cool.  Great fun today.

      It's true...somebody must really have it out for me. Let us begin with yesterday...all was going well untill afterschool.  Of course, as you well know, i had to go meet my father at his office so we could go to this office christmas party of his.  Also, as I'm sure you know, thats not what happened.....at all. Once on the train downtown, I realized that I had forgotten a few papers that my Dad had wanted me to bring him in my locker at school (of course) so I got off the train at 50th street and my walk back to school.  Silly me for thinking that was the end of that.  Entertainingly enough I made it into school easily enough, i dont think the guards noticed me, but thats ok.  I got my things, and left (once again) and set out to the train.  As I was walking down wondering in what way my father would murder me for being late, I got a call from him.  (oh joy of joys, just who I wanted to speak to)  I was then informed that he had an emergency meeting at the office and that he would meet me somewhere on 34th street, and that we could figure out where later.  So I plodded down to 34th street and wandered about in the dark, cold, loneliness that it was.   Granted this is when things began to look up.  As walked into the Manhattan Mall and saw Sharifah and Lauren(yay) we hung out for a bit untill my father called me and said "ok im on 34th, where are you?"  The three of us said our goodbyes and I went off to find my father and go to this party that i was sure would be...fun.  We arrived at this party and thusly began my several hours of standing alone in a corner in an ackward silence because who did I know at that party?? Come on...guess...thats right...nobody!  YaY!  I admit, there was some conversation, though it all happened to be about what i was doing with my self for college?/whats in canada?/oh my how you've grown.  The iceing on the cake came when both my parents, seperately mind you, told me to "loosen up"  yeah...a blast.  The only true reprive I got was the short few seconds i got to take a call outside from Summer, but that was rather short lived, ah well, a breaks a break. We got back home at one in the morning and five hours later i was awake again to take the cursed SATII's...wahoo.  an ordeal in itself, but i won't bother you with that.  So thats where i am now, returned and griping about my life, something that I'm sure none of you want to hear.....well to bad.  Thats that i suppose, not much else, i'll talk to you all later, and see you on tuesday. Have a good weekend, or at least one thats better than mine is turning out to be.  LATERZ!

      anyway, I had fun yesterday, and I just wanted to post some things here for all you not so able LOTR movie goers. There are certain things that you just can't get without reading the book. Several of you were asking me why Gandalf didn't die the last time... Well, I have the answers, there are in one of Tolkien's unfinished tales that his son edited and published. At least that is where I found them. Gandalf is one of the five Istari that were sent to Middle-Earth. Both in The Hobbit and in the Lord of the Rings he plays an essential role. He was sent to protect and guide the people of Middle-Earth. He was given the Elvenring Narya by Cirdan the Shipwright. His most valuable contributions were made in the War against Sauron and without the guidance and actions of Gandalf, Middle-Earth would have been lost. He tamed the horse Shadowfax and took him as his own. He was seen by many as a "stormcrow" as he always came with bad news that troubled a lot of people. Gandalf the Grey was lost in the mines of Moria as he fought the Balrog and was dragged down in the fall at the bridge of Khazad-dum. Other names for Ganadalf: Gandalf, Mithrandir, Olorin, Incanus, Lathspell, Stormcrow  Now about Balrogs... The Balrogs were spirits of fire seduced by Melkor in the beginning of Arda. In appearance, the Balrogs were man-like, but fire streamed from them, and they were swathed in dark shadows. They carried whips of flame and induced great terror in friends and foes alike. Most of the Balrogs were destroyed in the War of Wrath, but some few escaped over the Blue Mountains and lay hid in Middle-earth. Durin's Bane, the balrog that drove the Dwarves from Moria, was one of these. This Balrog caused the fall of Gandalf but was ultimately destroyed by Gandalf.   Now Orcs... Orcs have always been the footsoldiers of the enemy and in the Lord of the Rings both Saruman and Sauron used them for their evil purposes. Originally they are said to be Elves who we were corrupted by Melkor before the beginning of the First Age. In appearance, Orcs were squat, swarthy creatures. Most of them preferred the darkness, being blinded by the light of the Sun, but the kinds bred later in the Third Age such as the Uruk-hai could endure the daylight.   Some might want to know the history about Shadowfax, Ganalf's horse: Shadowfax is the fastest horse of Middle-earth and is a decendant of the mighty Mearas. He was tamed by Gandalf who then "barrowed" him from King Theoden. After Gandalf cured King Theoden, Shadowfax was given to Gandalf. Shadowfax's legendary speed was of vital importance for Gandalf's missions and it allowed him to make many just in time appearances. Shadawfax was always riden bare back and it is believed that he left Middle-earth together with his master Gandalf.   Who is Treebeard (the treant)... Treebeard is the oldest of the Ents, an ancient Tree-like people. His name is the Westron translation of the Elvish name Fangorn. Merry and Pippin met Treebeard as they came to Fangorn Forest after escaping from the orcs. They told all they knew and roused Treebeard. Treebeard then assembled the entmoot, a meeting of Ents and the Ents decided to attack Saruman in Isengard. They defeated Saruman and the Power of Isengard and thus played a vital role in the vicotory of good.   That's all for now, going to post stuff about yesterday sometime later when i get back from Legal Outreach. The movie I won't speak of until everyone sees it... Then by god will I speak!

      Just random thoughts on online lingo.  It seems weird that every word can be shortened rather ramdomly.  There's the combination of letters and numbers (sk8er, l8er, ladeda, i'm not sure if i've done those right) and using the first letters of words (brb, bbl, lol, ........................) and a bunch else.  I just find it amusing.  Can anyone tell I'm procratinating from studying for the IIs?

      hehehehehehe... I am so bored... The last tweny four hours haven't been what you would call fun... Infact they were pretty crummy. My shoulders hurts a lot! It's too much, feels like I should chop it off. Pain... Christmas is coming up, and I need to buy some people some stuff... Actually I'm not going to do any christmas stuff. Actually the only person that is getting a gift is Dollface, and that's cause it's her b-day in a couple of days. That doesn't mean that I  don't love you guys, its just that I am poor like a well...the title explains it, my moneys hehehe moneys...hehehe lies spilled across the street.

      My bad... You're right I am pretty slow. To just let the people know, the U.S History homework was to outline p735-740, I just outlined p535-540. The funny thing is that they are pretty similar. Anyway I didn't notice till like the last page that it wasn't adding up. LMAO Kazza Lite isn't my thing, not after it became horribly slow. Maybe that was just me... Limewire seemed to be fast, and thanks for the Aqualime, great thing. Man, I am now going to hit myself with a large piece of wood until I get smart...   PERSON: trying to start the essay tevren2k3: oh, i'll leave u alone, tell me when u are done PERSON: probably not until late PERSON: maybe tomoorow tevren2k3: u should really get started on it PERSON: i know tevren2k3: u've been putting it off for a long time PERSON: see u 2morrow tevren2k3: bye   Damn I am a dumbass, how the hell am I going to lose such a brilliant chance, damn I feel like such a fucking dumbass.

      Thie is the part of the post where I can safely say Conrad is an idiot. I have a very good reason. You SAW my post on the KaZaA Lite program, which is VERY MUCH  SPYWARE FREE . If you, for some ungodly reason, still wanna use the Limewire network, head on over to  urlLink Unite the Cows  an excellent p2p portal, and pick up your very own copy of "Aqualime," a spyware-free Limewire! Now stop being such a douche, and head over there RIGHT NOW.  EDIT: Unite the Cows makes you sign up, if u wanna avoid this pain, go to the  urlLink Aqualime Homepage.   I'm Deadinside, and that's not all....  "Oh so there's a real 'Paris Hilton'?....Do they allow umm....double occupancy...at the 'Paris Hilton'?"

      Oh my god, I hate  urlLink Limewire . Yet, I feel a strange attraction to it. The thing is that the downloads are pretty fast, at least for music.  I just can't believe that something so good could be fucked up the ass so much. The programmers crammed so much spyware up Limewire's ass.  Oh my god, it takes it two minutes to start up on my laptop. Some people might say, "it's cause you are using a laptop." No. That's not it. My laptop is pretty good. When I checked to see why my computer was going so slow, I saw that Limewire was running atleast 4 spyware programs on the side. I wanted throw my laptop out of the fourth floor window, the only problem being that I live on the first floor.

      Well I've got some news for the p2p fans. KaZaA Lite K++ has not been shut down, though, if you go to the site, you might think so. So far, the site to download is  urlLink this one . The news comes from a believeable source who posted a thread on the  urlLink Zeropaid  forums.  Appareantly, the hacker group ran into some trouble about copyright infringement, ironically, but that's not gonna stop them. Be advised, the current version MAY stop working, since the version of KaZaA it is built on (core 2.0.2) is pretty old (new is core 2.6).  If Sharman Networks hasn't banned it, it'll keep working, and that like is uselful. Someone, or well, a couple of people, are working one builing a new spyware free version of KaZaA based upon 2.6, but its not really ready, or all that great yet. For a good alternative, try  urlLink eMule  or see the full post  urlLink here.  Zeropaid itself is a good p2p portal, you might find some useful stuff there. If anything, ask me.  A few things looking up now, Ozzy's getting better, mostly. He can breathe without the aid of a respirator and, well...I think that's about it! The Fallout license MIGHT go to the old members of Black Isle Studios, AND Fallout: BoS, the BAD Fallout, is getting BAD reviews! Just goes to show you, they'll get theirs!  I'm Deadinside, and I burn with vengance...kinda...more like...a sizzle.  "Umm...I just wanna be friends...." "Ok, I'll be your friend...if you'll be my piece of ass"

       Jesus was way cool  Everybody liked Jesus  Everybody wanted to hang out with him  Anything he wanted to do, he did  He turned water into wine  And if he wanted to  He could have turned wheat into marijuana  Or sugar into cocaine  Or vitamin pills into amphetamines   He walked on the water  And swam on the land  He would tell these stories  And people would listen  He was really cool   If you were blind or lame  You just went to Jesus  And he would put his hands on you  And you would be healed  That's so cool   He could've played guitar better than Hendrix  He could've told the future  He could've baked the most delicious cake in the world  He could've scored more goals than Wayne Gretzky  He could've danced better than Barishnikov  Jesus could have been funnier than any comedian you can think of  Jesus was way cool   He told people to eat his body and drink his blood  That's so cool  Jesus was so cool  But then some people got jealous of how cool he was  So they killed him  But then he rose from the dead  He rose from the dead, danced around  Then went up to heaven  I mean, that's so cool  Jesus was way cool   No wonder there are so many Christians

      I was looking at the   urlLink ratemyteachers.com   site and it's the best.  People are such suck ups though with the comments.  You'd think they'd start insulting the teachers and whatnot.  Granted, I agreed with some of the nice ones, but still, you'd think some people would start bad mouthing the administration, but nooooooooooo.    And the best comment I've read about Mr. Fried, "Stop abusing Fred."  It's great!

      They say they may have capture that Saddamn guy, but it's probably just one of his doubles on a bad hair day, or a well-groomed bum. In any case, it's all just meant to calm the families down, and give 'em some false hope that their beloved children might be coming home soon, safe and sound. Nah, not while George W. Bush's still in power...  In other news, Keiko the Killer Whale died just a few days ago, the 13th, I think, in some coast in Norway. They were trying to coax him back into the open sea, apparently, and they noticed he was beginning to seem a bit lehargic, so they gave him antibiotics. Then he died. Well, that's another one...  In Google, type in "French Victories" then hit I'm feeling lucky, in case you didn't know already.

      Well...It's been a while since I have really posted something  good . I wanted to post yesterday, but by the time I got around to it, it was 1pm and I had to sleep. Yesterday was a fun filled day with lots of surprise. By fun I mean that is sucked the largest elephant around. Firstly I had to go to Legal Outreach where they whined about me never really changing my essay... Well screw that, it's fine the way it is. Waited around for Yee, who took forever. While I was waiting I found out that there was a mandatory thing at the Juliard that I had to got to, at 7. Now one might think that oh, that's great. You can be cultured and crap. NOOO! It was the worst two hours of my life. Of my several complaints, the first would be that it was dance, something I have carefully avoided since 6 th  grade. I had to think all deep and crap to see what they were actually trying to say with their movements. That is pure bull, after thirty minutes, all they were doing was frolicking on stage. I couldn't even fall asleep due to my mentor and his friends poking me to death every time I blinked. I might have somewhat enjoyed it the dancers were professionals, no damn, cheap Legal Outreach sends us to a free show where the choreographers showed off their dance students.  At one point I swear that they were having gay sex on the stage. I didn't even have to pay for this one.  But it was so annoying, every five minutes one guy would say something about not being able to hear the other guy. It was a original thought, but it got played out after the fifth time. Then there was a guy and a girl and when the girl sang (horribly) the guy would shut her up. There was one point when she sang while he was lifting her above his head and all I could think was "drop her, come on, end it." The guy would sing horribly as well, and the chick would shut him up as well, and me being me hoped that she would deck him... After the show I went to go get some dinner, note to everyone there are no good restaurants around 65th street. First I hit that pizza place,  urlLink Raybari Pizza  (yes they have a web site).  They make pure crap in the shape of triangles. The pizza was burned and he got the toppings all wrong. I didn't ask for spinach  jackass .  Then there is that Japanese place on 72nd. They gave me the wierdest look when I ordered 1 shrimp tenpura. The guy at the counter drew a blank and said " one  tenpura?" It was good. The soy sauce tasted like watered down diet coke though... That was yesterday.

      Too much fuckin' bad shit this past week. On 12/08, just yesterday, the much anticipated Fallout 3 was canned by the company developing it, Interplay. They "intelligently" laid off THE ENTIRE STAFF of Black Isle Studios, a division of Interplay, and the ones responsible for many enjoyable games, such as Fallout 2, and The Baldur's Gate series. Even though Interplay's in DEEP financial trouble, they decide to throw away their most promising asset, to concentrate on a game everyone hates. Check out the story as reported by "No Mutants Allowed"  urlLink here . Suck it HARD Interplay jackasses, hope you know that you ruined some good people's lives laying them off like that, and that you'll all BURN IN HELL!  Shit can't stop for the already deeply troubled Ozzy Osbourne. It was recently discovered that he was grossly over-medicated during the run of his reality tv-show, "the Osbournes", which caused him to be mostly incoherent, more than usual, and have limited coordination. He went to the hospital about a month ago to treat his tremors, which had suspiciously gotten worse. The doctor who had overprescribed the music legend was apparently accused of doing the same thing to various other patients, and  nearly  lost his license....nearly.... If that wasn't enoguh, the Ozzman was in an automobile accident earlier today!! His ATV crashed while he was driving it in his estate in southern England. He broke some ribs, his collarbone, and cracked some vertebrae in his neck. He had to get emergency surgery to help blood flow to an obstucted blood vessel. His injuries aren't expected to be life threatening...hopefully.  And with those pic things...I do  not  wanna see them, not mine at least. I just know they're gonna be terrible.     The Velvet Underground - Who Loves the Sun?   Who loves the sun Who cares that it makes plants grow Who cares what it does Since you broke my heart  Who loves the wind Who cares that it makes breezes Who cares what it does Since you broke my heart  Pa Pa Pa Pa Who loves the sun Pa Pa Pa Pa Who loves the sun Pa Pa Pa Pa Not everyone Pa Pa Pa Pa Who loves the sun  Who loves the rain Who cares that it makes flowers Who cares that it makes showers Since you broke my heart  Who loves the sun Who cares that it is shining Who cares what it does Since you broke my heart  Pa Pa Pa Pa Who loves the sun Pa Pa Pa Pa Who loves the sun Pa Pa Pa Pa Not everyone Pa Pa Pa Pa Who loves the sun Sun Sun Sun  Pa Pa Pa Pa Who loves the sun Pa Pa Pa Pa Who loves the sun Pa Pa Pa Pa Not everyone Pa Pa Pa Pa Who loves the sun    I'm Deadinside, nothing ever goes right, so just forget about it. If you ignore it, it'll go away and stop bugging you.  "arg, I'm too old and too rich for this"

      Yes, cancelled!  Praise the lord, Hallelujah, and all that jazz.  I have no idea when they're gonna reschedule it, and frankly, i don't care.  it was just a pain having to get up in the morning though, and because i didn't look at the weather, i actually left my apartment and walked in the damn cold.  i should really start watching the news again, huh?  Just to ensure that nothing like this happens again.    Been trying to do the english project.  I'm not sure if it's working out or not.  You know what's funny summer?  Delilah, who has been "in charge" of everything and kinda setting stuff up, hasn't been doing her part.  Atleast not yet anyway.  Maybe i've spoken too soon.  But the plan was to get everything in by saturday night, and lo and behold, it's saturday night.  hmm...  And it's cold, just to let all you know and such.  So make sure to have heat one, or take a niiiiiice looooooong bath.  That was what i did at 3 in the afternoon today.  And it was wonderful.  Never felt warmer in all my life.  BLISS!

      Greetings from the snowy (make that snowing - still) North.  SAT's have been cancelled?  Umm  . . .either I'm really happy for you guys, or it really sucks.  Are they cancelled all the way to next month, or just for a little while?  I indeed made it up here safely, though we ended up taking the Hudson Line instead of our car.  It was kind of funny, 'cause we couldn't get through to the Ossining house on the phone, then we could *barely* get down the stairs at 225th (icky, evil, slippery stairs - poor Nyisha) and then the ticket machine didn't work because it was too cold.  Snow was pretty, though - until we got off at Ossining and *finally* got through to family at the house and it took them nearly an hour to get there.  Between this and Rockefeller my toes may have to be amputated. ^_^  I was gonna call you, Hyper, but by then it was like ten thirty.  That was *my* evening!  I miss you guys, and I'll see you bright and early Monday morning. . . .you think Henkel'll let us in?  Hugs!

      SAT's of all shapes, sizes, colour and creed have been postponed in the city, and I'm not sure if I'm happy or not about that. Mostly...undecided. Guess that's just more time before the inevitable. Well anyway...  Crapasscartoons is getting a facelift! We've moved to a new host for more flexibilty and no fuckin' banners. The link on the toolbar on the right'll still get you the old site b/c we haven't told the .tk router the new address. We've still got some work to do, which I hope to get done tomorrow, er..today, now that the SAT's've been postponed. I'll post again when we've got the site fixed up so that we can have a new cartoon there on a regular basis, along with other crap, mebbe.  That's all for news crap, uh lemme think....yeah...should be it...     The Offspring - Self Esteem   I wrote her off for the tenth time today, And practiced all the things I would say. But she came over, I lost my nerve. I took her back and made her dessert.  Now I know I'm being used, That's okay man cause I like the abuse. I know she's playing with me, That's okay 'cause I got no self esteem.  Oh way, oh yeah, yeah-eah oh yeah, yeah-ah, (x2)  We make plans to go out at night, I wait till 2 then I turn out the light. All this rejection's got me so low, If she keeps it up I just might tell her slow.  Oh way, oh yeah, yeah-eah oh yeah, yeah-ah, (x2)  (Chorus): When she's saying that she wants only me, Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends. When she's saying that I'm like a disease, Then I wonder how much more I can spend. Well I guess I should speak up for myself, But I really think it's better this way. The more you suffer, The more it shows you really care . Right? Yeah-hea-ea  Now I'll relate this little bit, That happens more than I'd like to admit. Late at night she knocks on my door, (She's) drunk again and looking to score.  Now I know I should say no, But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go. I may be dumb, But I'm not a dweeb. I'm just a sucker with no self esteem.  Oh way, oh yeah, yeah-eah oh yeah, yeah-ah, (x2)  (Chorus)    That's all for now, you bastards, I'm Deadinside, and I hate you, 'cept maybe in the way that I don't really...aw..man..how fuckin' feeble was that...I'm getting old...I can't find my joint medicine...  "OH NO!! ITS  TOO  HOT! PULL OUT, PULL  OUT! "

      LOOK!  Outside the window, the first snowfall of the year.  And man is it coming down hard!  Isn't the first suppose to be all whispy and whatnot?  Light and airy?  (it sounds like I'm describing a pie, mmm pie...)  Anyway...if only it was a thursady instead of a friday, maybe then we'd have a snow day or something.  But alas, it is too much to dream for!    Well off I go, and to study for the IIs.  Maybe if i repeat that enough times to myself, I might actually do it!  And to Summer, if you survive the snow, give us a sign!

Both were pretty funny. this is a pretty inside joke, so most people like you won't get it:  "good job team" "LOL"  HAHAHAHAHAHA.. The second game was pretty funny, since our opponents didn't turn on ally chat, and so i had to suffer their n00b arguements. to all n00bs: J00 4r3 411 f4Gz !!! i 0WnZ J00 !!

Didn't think I'd get even this far, and even if I don't get much beyond this, I'd have to give thanks for just the will, the fuel to get to this point. That's you dollface, even if all this college stuff doesn't get me anywhere, getting here was enough, and I supose I did it. Thanks for that, regardless of whether or not you think you did anything to contribute to it, I remember you have. Besides, we all see things the way we want to see them, isn't that so? Anyway...

      So I decided to brave the elements and Conrad's warnings and looked at the NYCBOE.com site, saw the picture, really gross, and decided to read what the site says, to "understand their side of the story" and all that jazz.  After you get through the picture on the homepage, there really isn't anything else.  But anyhoo...I was reading and it's quite funny actually, these pro-life people.    If you should decide to brave the really really really gross picture, the link to "The truth about Planned Parenthood" is really funny.  They try to slander that so badly, placing these weird quotes, and coming to these absurd conclusions.  Such as, Planned Parenthood advocates child sex, the head is a racist (I don't see how that would intrude on the organization), they respect privacy (keeping an abortion secret from the girls boyfriend), and...this is really funny, a quote, Planned parent hood advocates humanism, which is, "It seeks not to educate our children in moral values, but to indoctrinate them into the Humanist philosophy that proclaims there is no objective moral code, and that right and wrong can be decided solely by the individual."  So I suppose we should never trust the kids.    I suppose the only non-bias one was "Politics" because it listed many parties and what they thought, instead of just the pro-life ones.  I thought it was gonna say how some parties could change the world and what not.  Everything else is VERY pro-life, and don't even look under "No Convinced?" because there's another disgusting picture, I'm sure (I chickened out, and stopped the loading before anything appeared, what can I say, one gross thing a day is good enough for me).   Yeah, so looking at the site has made me realize that there is no way I can ever be pro-life.  Pro-choice is a good thing.  AND a message: Abstinence is where it's at kids.  Remember, Abstinence!

      No I'm not talking about the singer. I'm talking about the new game  urlLink Prince Of Persia: Sands of Time . If you want you can  urlLink download the demo here . I don't usually play games like this, but this one is an just too great to be passed. It's developed by  urlLink Ubi Soft , which means Splinter Cell video engine. It looks so nice. Not to mention the camera angles in this game are actually good unlike all the other games in this genre. There is a complete zoom out mode, which really helps. The puzzles aren't that hard, the fight scenes are awesome. Oh my god :@ You control time! Or at least the ablity to rewind. Unlike most other games which would abuse this power and turn it into a GOD-MODE type, this game is very different, you can only rewind time with the sand you get. Hence the sands of time. Anyway, you get the sand when you kill an enemy and drain them of their sand or else they will come back to life, or from this fountain thing... The demo is great, the only problem that I have with it is that you can't save, but that's probably what make me want to play it oh so much. I think I am at the end now, there isn't anything to do or anywhere to go... I just run around in the broken down court yard. Two web comics have managed to capture the game's game-ness (for a lack of better words):  urlLink Penny Arcade , urlLink VG Cats

      Well... Here is the story: General and I were looking online for the regent testing news when we bumped int  urlLink NYBOE.COM . I suggest that you not go there unless you have a strong stomach for pure, unfiltered, goddamnit did you have to post that on the internet? For all those with weak stomachs that will not go to the site, let me offer a description of it. It's a Pro-Life site that shows pictures of dead babies. Now, I am not pro-life or even pro-pregancy rights or whatever, but this is just disgusting. I mean it's one thing to make your point, and a whole another to post pictures of dead babies. In fact that site made me more pro-women's rights because I was horrified that some bastard out there was putting pictures of dead babies on the internet, especially named NYCBOE. Come on, what if some kid looking for news about his school in New York were to get there. No shame damn it!

      You're right, Hyperspaztic, that can't be good. Something might be wrong with ur jaw, but its probably nothing more than a wisdom tooth. Nothin' serious, may haveta just pull it out, which I hear is inhumanly painful.  In any case, we're goin' to that whole skating thing tomorrow, and you know what that means! It means everyone gets to see just how ragingly incompetent I can be. No big deal, I'm gonna try to get used to it as much as I can, and maybe I'll get down some basics. Comforting to know I'll have some company, tho, seems the General is about as incompetent as I am, but he's probably better, anyhow.  Let's see how much fun the rest of you can have, tho.

      Time for a self health diagnosis.  Everytime I bite down, the left side of my jaw snaps (?), cracks (?)..... pops!  Yes that's it.  And when I open my mouth widely, it hurts tremendously.  That can't be good, can it?  It's kind of weird, yes fasinating.  It hurts evertime I do it, yet continue to do so just because it amazes me how weird, and how much it hurts each time I do it.  I really should stop.....really should.......

      Check out this Boston Globe Article:  urlLink Powell holds out possibility that Iraq had no banned weapons . I especially like the part: "''What was it?'' he asked. ''One hundred tons, 500 tons or  zero tons ? Was it so many liters of anthrax, 10 times that amount or nothing?''"  There is also the part when they comment on Iraq selling its weapons to Syria. The only problem of the Bush Administration's theory is that Iraq wasn't rich enough to buy/harvest nuclear components to sell in the first place. As for the selling of WOMD, the reason that none were found isn't because they were all sold, no it's because they weren't any to start out with. That's the reason why Saddam always said that they had all be dismantled and he didn't have anymore nor did he run any programs to make more. The UN even asserted this more than once. Even if he sold WOMD compenents to Syria, what's wrong with that? I mean he just can't have them lying around, so he sold 'em. This is just another example of the Bush Administration making excuses.

      Yea if you are interested in this, then go to  urlLink The President's radio address . Anyway I am going to deicper and comment on it paragraph by paragraph.  THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. This coming week I will report to the Congress and the American people on the state of our union. Over the past few years, America has been confronted with great challenges, and the American people have responded with strength and compassion and confidence. This nation is meeting its priorities, both at home and abroad.  Today I (the president) shall give the state of the Union (by the way I'm not sure, but did this air 8am or 8pm... I remember the Columbia Spectator saying somehing about this being at 8pm)... me as the president again... I have put America in some deep shit homie.  America continues to wage a relentless campaign against terrorists who threaten our country. We're fighting this war on the offensive, denying terrorists refuge, identifying and seizing their secret finances, and holding terrorists and their sponsors to account. These terrorists are still dangerous, and we will stay on the hunt until they are destroyed.  Your country? dude do you know that they attack other counrties? I mean you got hit once, Irsarel, India, those guys get hit everyday. Why would terrorists asking you for refuge in the first place? I mean your the big guy with a shot gun who is running after them. How do you tell a terrorist from a non terrorist? Destroyed? You're actually going to after every single one? For all that don't know, terrorists are like grey hairs, pull one out and two grow in. I mean all you're doing now is spreading the hate.   Across the greater Middle East, America is confronting dangers and promoting democracy and hope, as the alternative to terror and violence. Afghanistan, once ruled by the brutal Taliban regime, has adopted a new constitution and is following the path of democracy, including providing fundamental rights to women.  By confronting dangers, you mean the terrorists who are running into Iraq now cause there is no Saddam and his harsh methods to set them straight. Now these terrorists are going to get the people against you. "look, you're gonna let your ass be conquered by these bitches? Sure they got rid of Saddam, but look at that mofo and look at fact that its worse now without Saddam... I say we hit back..." This the mentality that the terrorists are now going to use against you. Fundemental rights to women? Dude, you are making it seem like women had  no  influence in the middle east. Just off on a tangent: This is what the europeans said about the American Indians, they too used the women arguement to conquer America. Women might not vote, but they are not considered slaves, it's quite the opposite.  The leader of Libya has now pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his weapons of mass destruction programs. And in Iraq, the enemies of freedom are being systematically routed from their holes and rounded up. Iraqis are assuming greater responsibility for their own security and future government. American troops in that country are performing their duty with skill and courage, and we're proud of them all.  The only reason he cooperating is cause he doesn't want a bomb shoved up his fat ass.  Here at home, we continue to build prosperity and economic security for our people. Tax relief has helped turn our economy around. We've doubled the child tax credit, cut taxes for everyone who pays income taxes, and increased incentives for small businesses to invest in new equipment and create jobs.  That kinda sounds kewl... now when am I going to see a check for this?  The results are clear. Our economy grew at its fastest pace in two decades in the third quarter of 2003. Manufacturers are seeing a rebound in new orders in factory activity. And more than a quarter-million new jobs have been created since August.  That's funny cause it's not true....LOL   Our government has also acted to strengthen our Medicare system. To keep our commitment to America's senior citizens, we're adding better preventative care and a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. Many thought these reforms were impossible; yet members of both parties put old debates behind them and fulfilled our promise to America's seniors. On Tuesday night I will outline the steps we must take to meet the goals of this nation. We will work to expand opportunities for all Americans to own their own business. We'll press forward on an agenda of economic growth so that everyone who wants to work can find a job. We'll take steps to help families and small businesses deal with the rising cost of health care. We will continue to help schools and students meet the high standards we've set so no child in America is left behind. We will encourage the good work of faith-based groups that bring hope to those in need. For the sake of our own freedom and security, we will continue to fight the war on terror.  This is the kinda shit I am talking about. Good shit, now I can finally go see that damn doctor and get this racoon off my ass....no i am serious get it off.  With all these actions, we will continue to confront the challenges of our time, and we will continue to make America a more secure, more prosperous, and more hopeful place. Thank you for listening.  Bullshit Well this is all I could find for now, I think I have the full version in my hotmail account, will add it on later. Enjoy

      Sometimes, it just isn't worth it. I try and try and the result is the same. Hmm... What song is this? Sounds familiar. I would post the rest of this post in hindi (hindlish), but I know that some of you out there know hindlish and so there goes that. At least I'll always have those inside jokes, the one that I make with myself. It's just been harder to that over the last few days, to keep that smile going.  'Kisse rahun tere bina'  Sorry that's from the song that I was listening to  [Faasla-Collage] . Sorry for the lack of peppy-ness, over the last few days I've craving coffee again. It's zhang's fault, him and his black coffee everyday, damn him. VAN HESLING FOREVER!! Sorry about that, it was my first attempt at normalcy. Goddamnit I hate the Hives. They always ruin a good mood, and Weezer just followed up on it. Pencils can be very sharp and lead poisoning is dangerous.  Hum to dewaane hey tumare  sorry again, new song  [Tauba-Chalte Chalte] .... going to go try to cheer myself up with some bleach (kidding)... Maybe if I take my brains out through my nose and try to put it back through my ears it would help... Probably not, just going to go eat some babies...   P.S. The reason that I am acting like this is because I am bored out of my skull and I haven't gotten much time to myself lately, so if you see me avoiding you guys for a while, that's why.

      So I was reading some article in the Voice and it was about that presidental candidate, Dennis Kucinich.  Pretty interesting, it gave some insight of what kind of person he is.  Of course, there's absolutely no way he's gonna win...too idealistic.  Too much of that, "all the world need is love" and "why can't we all be friends."  And he's a vegan.  I think what I'm trying to say is that he's a one man hippie revolution.  Still doesn't mean that I don't like him though, in fact, I like him more than any of the other candidates.    Oh, and another exciting fact of today...I HAVE HOT WATER!!!!!!!!  YAY!!  I have been going without it since friday morning!  And with the college interview on saturday, it was just hell trying to bath with cold cold water!  It hurt my head.  It was kind of like brain freeze, except not.  Then I finally had to boil water to bath.  But it still wasn't fun.  Not fun at all.

      dab a bit here, dab a bit there, dab a bit everywhere. The day's been going slow, haven't really done anything, gone anywhere, not to mention that it's snowing outside... Two things that go great together: Pessimism and apathy. Don't ask me how 'cause if you don't already know the anwser you're pretty damn slow.  Over the last couple of nights I have become  really aware of the fact that I don't dream... at all.  Last night I went to sleep some what early at around midnight and throughout the night, I didn't dream a bit. Not even a thought. I woke up in the morning (this time it was morning [9:00am] :!) and felt like crap, I felt like I had shut my eyes and reopened them. Over the last few hours I have been thinking about this and discovered that dreams (not nightmares) are what give people hopes (right?). Well and this explains my lack of hope in this world.  Now I know why I don't like hash so much. Let me explain: last time I did hash, I felt like I would be in one place, close my eyes and be tired and in another place. Well that's kind of what happens when I sleep only I don't end up on some resturant looking up at the waitress, wondering how the fuck I got there. This whole lack of dreams is driving me insane.  Another thing that I've recently discovered is that I hate everyone, it might seem like I am your friend, but in reality I really hate you... a lot. It's so much easier to hate then to to love/be friendly. Why do people that hate is destructive? It's actually very construtive, it sets boundaries so that order can be maintained. For example if we hate each other, we won't talk to each other, end of problem. Besides, hate teaches us to be self-sufficent. I don't know if my eyes are burning with blood, tears and rage or with insomia. I was actually thinking about that message on my friend's profile... Today is the official salute to all the losers, those who don't care to be on top but rather just want out of the dog pile. A salute to those of us who can't tell the truth since we don't know how. A salute to the candy man on the street eyeing little girls not cause he's horny but cause he lost his daughter. A salute to the poor people with nothing but misery and desotution. A salute to the high order of 'I don't give a shit since I've been shot. Thank god finally.' And lastly a salute to those who don't want to exist and don't care that no one thinks that they exist. Salute. **update: I have MySQL mostly working, or working enough, now to start on the PHPadmin.

This dude is deep real deep. **update: I have my Apache Server working, and I have PHP running on my server, the only things left are: MySQL ( shitty piece of crap  sh!tty piece of carp is giving me trouble) and PHPadmin so that I can get the comic up and  runny  running.

All this means is that well no ads, and about three weeks for me to re educate my apache... well still a maybe and yes... r0x0rz ur 80x0rz coming soon, by the way I made some changes to the name...be back in about a week or so!

      Wow, them is big words....  Anyway, I've realized that alumni interviews suck!  Not that I've had one or anything, but I will in the future, so my conclusion is justified.  And not mind you, the alumni interview that I wanted.  So that just sucks even more.    And my hands have officially frozen.  It is 9 degrees but probably lower than that outside as of this moment.    Word of wisdom: The cold and alumni interviews suck.

      The eventualities seem obvious. Highly desiarable. I'll do my best, if its to just have feeling again. I've tried so hard to keep myself dead inside for so long, to numb reality. I've become slightly desensitized.   So let's see, what's new now? Dunno. I've managed to probably avoid failing U.S. History...MAYBE. In anycase, here's a toast to caring for the first time. I haven't been doing much recently, not really. Stuff in general that is. Kinda boring, and odd that I find it boring, I used to not get bored.  Ok, now I've GOT to say something. Our school's Admin.'s been harrassing teachers they have a personal problem against, trying to out 'em unfairly, playing dirty. For freedom, and just plain justice, we can't let such things happen, especially when these teachers are great people. The Admin. is just a stupid moronic group of people, led by a fascist, power mad dictator, entitled "principal." Being a beliver in the word of Punk, I can't help but having a problem with this. If there's a way to support these teachers (who will remain anonymous over this webpage), I will find away to join in. I can't stand idly by, ignorance and dirty tricks like this can't be allowed to continue. It's completely unfair and just wrong and hurtful. I strongly encourage you guys to consider this too, the Admin.'s been all over us for shit, and the teachers try to help us out, risking themselves. Now let's help them out, for being to kind.

      Yea, I found some kewl stuff which is essential when trying to fake the geek funk or actually doing the groove. Firstly you have to know the language of the geek, it's kinda like ebonics...only for not ghetto people. It's called 1337 or 'leet' short for elite. It was mainly used by hackers in the late 1990s, now it's mainly a joke. A good place that will translate 1337 is: urlLink h4x0r . I'll finish this post later... have to catch some zzz.

       urlLink Subject: Evolution and M&Ms  This site just speaks for itself. I mean it just cheered me up. It's around 11:30pm when I am rushing to finish my homework, and I run into this site, don't ask how...well you can ask me if you want. Anyways it's pretty funny, and it's easy to see that the author of the site is either a genius explaining to masses (asses) or a complete failure in life (like me) who is trying to act smart. Yea I thought it was the second one too.

      Yes, its sad indeed how ignorant most of the world is. So much so, I failed in attempting to bottle my hatred for it, and try to not insult these people who are just too stupid to continue living. I read the article that that Conrad guy mentioned, and decided to send him an e-mail myself. Its better to try to sound civilized, but sometimes you think, "oh, to hell with civility"    Dear Mr. Christopher Bryon,  This email is in regard to your article on the New York Post, "Give Back Take-Two." After reading your article, several questions arose in my mind, firstly, I question your dedication to actually investigating this game and its actual influences on real people. Furthermore, your seemingly personal attacks on this company, rasises suspicions on the true nature of your comments. Were you perhaps viciously violated by an emplyee of this company? Did someone steal your car, with your prostitue in it, then killed her and took all of her money before you could have your way with her? Maybe you didn't quite realize exactly what you were doing when you wrote this article, and didn't realize the strength of the gaming masses. No, our actions aren't an influence of the overwhelming amounts of violence in video games such as the one discussed in your article. We are powered by our own minds, which also serves to disprove your argument, about video games magically turning the average adolecant, into a brainless, blood thirsty idiot who attempts to rob cars and run over other people to recieve points and cash. The assumptions that all people are indeed so easily influenced by a highly organized series of programming code and images, is completely absurd. The reality is, that we are driven to do something by our own, independant decisions. Truly, religion causes mpore violence and hatred, than a digital disk. Being as this is fact, why not go out and attack religion as well? Its ideals also cause people to think in a certain way, and behave a certain way. Maybe my original proposition on your personal feelings for the company are indeed fueling this mindless attack on a relatively harmless game, which mostly just serves to let other people relieve their frustrations in an envirionment that doesn't actually hurt anyone. How many times have you honestly witnessed a teen, sit and play Grand Theft Auto, then suddenly stand up, and seriously decide "Hey! I'm gonna go sell cocaine and get myself some whores! To hell with scruples!" No times. I suggest that you now stop reading this e-mail, go to the kitchen, turn on your oven, then place your head inside, and wait. Keep waiting, when you can't see, hear or feel anything at all, that's when you know you've waited enough. Now just lay there.   Yeah, its a sad thing indeed. Anyway, I've gotta go try to do some school work now, since I am such a failure. I'll say hello to Satan for ya!  I'm Deadinside, I need some sharp knives.  "A baseball bat! Oh joy! Now I can commit as many crimes as I want, thank you video games!"

      This is the emailed to the reporter (lol him a reporter) from the NY POST concerning  urlLink this article . Penny Arcade addressed it too, but nothing like this:  Hey there? I was just wondering if you actually played video games or just spend the entire day trash talking and being a fucktard. Maybe you are doing  urlLink this  to gain publicity for your news paper, I don't know why exactly but it's a stupid move. Video Games are meant to distract people from the pains of reality into a virtual playground where they can forfill their inner desired in a virtual reality instead of a real one. Would you rather have killers running outside or in a videogame. I think you jumped to your conclusion way too fast. People who play video games aren't that bad, infact if look into  urlLink Child's Play  you will see that gamers have a heart of gold and aren't the vicious racists that you potray them to be. In conclusion, I would just like to remind you that you are a bias bastard who fucks sliver back gorillas in the ass while watching some strip dancing hobo in the park, mother fucking dickfart.  I probably won't be able to check this out in school cause of the proxy. As my new year's wish, I ask that very one flame  urlLink this  retard with emails stating that he should be sent off to a leber colony and be left there to rot until even the lebers grow tired of his company (which shouldn't be long). Then he should be forced to walks the streets of NYC naked. By the way his e-mail is: cbyron@nypost.com.

      So, its starting again, real soon, and I couldn't hate it more. Yeah, well I might not even show up for our first day back, really don't feel like it, or come back to just face more failure, not that it even bothers me anymore. Its just the look of disappoitment that does. Oh well. Yeah, I got my pictures back today too, wel...technically yesterday. I look horrible in all of 'em, just as expected. I did manage to pick one out of the horrors, and I plan to burn the rest.   College guys? What've you people been up to?     Iggy & the Trolls - Whatever  I'm sittin' like a stone On a solitary evening Without my girl life has no meaning She didn't say why And she didn't say what for she just said "I've been thinking it over" And whatever, Whatever Whatever She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades away Whatever  The solution to love I haven't found yet Does God have curlers and a hairnet Everything I say comes out To be a no no The feelings I had were the Only promo Whatever (x3) She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades away Whatever  Now I'm just one of the Joes On the corner I guess I ought to stay home And watch the porno I wanna get close But no one Will let me I wish someone would reach out and get me Whatever (x3) She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades She doesn't want to play And her face just fades She doesn't want to play And her touch just fades away  Whatever (x3)  (x2) She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades away Whatever (x3)  She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades away    There's not much left, I'm starting too see, maybe nothing at all for much longer. But there is something out there, and I kinda wanna see it, no matter what it takes. It'll just tear me apart to do so though, since I'll haveta leave what I do have behind, but that'll probably just have to be something else I'll get have to used to when the time comes. And when it does, I'll have to say "I appreciate it"  I'm Deadinside, and dead outside.  "Hey there world, here I come"

      My dearest little people!  'S funny, I was looking at the blog today and wondered why the phrase "Rambling Drunken Monkey" kept coming to mind - then I remembered this used to be  called  that.  It's nice to know I'm not just going insane (more so).  Hyper, my love - Doll is still upset that we let those college guys go . . .apparently she  wouldn't  have claimed to be from Boston. ^_~  Dollface - *giggles* . . .*giggles more*  Was it sunny today?  To the rest of you - hi ho, hi ho, it's back to hell we go!  Vacation's dying fast - but only three more weeks til Regents! Love!

Movies galore, but stayed in his room most of the time, so there was in reality one movie.  Well, for me anyway, because I left early.  Is it my fault I would like to pretend to be studious once in a while??  It makes me feel important and speeecial!  Hope the rest of you peoples enjoyed the rest of the night!

That thing about the 49 foot snake, well it's true, just heard about it from an aussie friend. Tomorrow gonna be a hell of a day. For those who are wondering I am probably coming to zhang's get together, not cause I wanna hang out, but cause it's a new year and I need a drink.

      Some really funny-ass cartoons've shown up on  urlLink Newgrounds.com . So unique, they've actually gotten their onw section on the site:  urlLink "Flash Fables" . Check it out, damn funny, but must warn...LOUD at some points.  I've still got to do these damn supps for SUNY's, they should really just go off and screw themselves. They want people to go there, but yet they make you do all this weird, unnecessary bullshit. Someday, the US'll turn communist, and we can all go and get college educations and everyone'd be smart.     Iggy Pop - The Jerk  Look, here comes the jerk !  See the guy with the fakey smile, Talkin' to my girl in a friendly style. He thinks he's quite the flirt, She'd suck a rats' dick before she'd fuck him  His brain is full of dirt, That's why the guy's a jerk, His balls are gonna burst, Thats why the guy's a jerk  Oh man you're killin' me ! Hey man you're killin' me !  He hangs out by the ladies room, His pick up line is like the voice of doom. "Hey baby do ya wanna go out with me, and by the way I make a lotta money."  His method just don't work, That's why the guy's a jerk. By the office Johnny lurks, That's why the guy's a jerk  Jerk (x11)  Oh man you're killin' me ! Hey man you're killin' me !  look here comes the jerk (x4)  His brain is full of dirt, That's why the guy's a jerk, His balls are gonna burst, That's why the guy's a jerk  (x2) Oh man you're killin' me ! Hey man you're killin me !    Hey, everyone loves pissing off other people, right? Well that lovely movie "The Passion of the Christ" has gotten every religious fanatic of Jeudo-christian religions yellin' their heads off, 'cause they say the truth is all lies. Well, to make 'em happier, I suggest that everyone hear who hasn't seen it, go add to the $117 Million its already made. That number alone shows that a few close-minded individuals can't stop artistic freedom, and most of all, facts from spreading into the mainstream.  I'm the Zenman, go Buddhism!

      just had to link you guys to this  urlLink 1337 (0|\/|1( . Hehehe that's my future in politics... Man it's been a while... about two days. News about Kerry's former/still-on-going affairs haven't risen yet. Somewhat disturbing... Well I finally managed to figure out why Dean didn't win. His entire campaign was directed towards the younger generation... and as we all know the younger generation do crap. Since not many of his teenage supporters voted... well you know the rest. I was rooting for Dean all the way... now I have to hang my head in shame and root for Sharpton... is he still in the race? I haven't heard news of him in a while... By the way, Nice to see you back Todd.

      some of the craziest things happen 'round here. 'Specially  urlLink this ,  a very large cat, huge really, and its not a fake pic either.   As expected, Napster's goin' under...AGAIN. Seems even Roxio couldn't even save the should've-stayed-dead p2p music prog. It really was never a good idea to try to revive it as a paid service, especially now, what with the major competition on of current free p2p progs (such as Aqualime, Ares, and the multitude of Lite KaZaA versions.) If you wanna read up on the whole damn thing as reported by Zeropaid,  urlLink here you go.      Iggy Pop - Weasels  Weasels  Weasels are runnin me to death, I checked my gas there ain't much left. Still I will take a parting shot, Before I leave myself to rot.  Barbaric motherfucking weasels  Weasels (x2)  Weasels have always been my friends, I've turned them loose now there's no end. Giants of rock tell giant lies, Weasels control the evil skies.  Barbaric motherfucking weasels, Bad breath bad taste cause of diseases.  I feel disgrace and I feel shame, I feel anger and I feel blame, I feel suspicion and I feel pride, I feel weasels on all sides.  Weasels (x5)  With guitars on T.V., Weasels Rewriting rock history, Weasels With an office and a chair, Weasels With nice butts and long silky hair.

I've had all week and I haven't come up with anything really interesting to write an article about. Thing is, I could write about anything! And I've got nothing, oh well.  In other stuff, here's a good link to put up,  urlLink www.sexylosers.com . I haven't been there in a while, but its a damn funny comic made by some white dude in the anime style. WARNING: Crude sexual humour and brief nudity! So dun visit if you've got parents around. Also, its fairly far along, so you might haveta go back in the series, if you see its a comic that's part of a series of its own. Pretty funny tho, deserving of the side navigation bar...HINT...  I'm not an expert with HTML, and I dunno how to make those fancy bullet things Conrad makes, so I'll just list more of these thinghys that are some good resources for, whatever you're into  - urlLink MxTabs.net  - for all your guitar tab needs, also has some good user-written articles. If what you're lookin' for isn't there... - urlLink Ultimate-guitar Archive  - for anyother stuff. Site's a bit weird to navigate at times tho. - urlLink ZeroPaid  - THE P2P network, for all P2P news - urlLink Filesharing Talk  - for anything real specific on P2P progs.  All done, go to hell!

As of the current, I am listening to some online radio thing and it sounds like it's coming out of some cheesey studio...or not the studio, but some people just decided to get together and rent a radio session.  But anyhoo, they're playing, what I think is the stuff they wrote themselves about some real hilarity.  The song that was on was, "my countries flag is red, black and blue" and just had some horrible, HORRIBLE rhyme schemes that made me laugh.  I don't usually mind those songs, but it was just really funny.  I kind of wish I remembered some lines from it to write down, but alas...  But anyway kiddies...until next time...ta!

      dirt. Pure dirt. Dean has pulled back, damn him. Kerry not that great, too early to type good. Soon there is going to be news story about Kerry's affairs which will destroy his campaign. Democrats setting him up like a little bitch. Did you know he sent his secutary/one time lover to Africa so that the media wouldn't catch her. Well once the media pulls all the info together, they'll publish it. At least that's what i heard from someone from Bill Bradely's office... New SUVs are also coming out, of course the majority of them japanese, that are environmentally 'good'. There was something I was going to post that was actually kewl... but's it early and my brain isn't working right... right so here is a filler:  urlLink The Original Pitfall , now you can play it online. This isn't that 2k3 shit either. Oh yea... if you wanna read 'quality' blogs, click that little TBBL thing on the side bar, and it take you to the 'blogs that evolve'... still only a worm... at least not a microbe....

      Anime scares me, I been sitting around all day watching cartoon network and for the last two hours or so they have been playing anime. These anime really suck. For example SD Gundam, the original Gundam series was great, but this chibbi shit is like a over medicated hobo on crack-coicane. It's so bad!!! I really hate it. why are their heads so big?? Today's suggested reading:  urlLink Anthem . The entire book can be found online. If you don't want to read it online, just take a copy from school. More stuff later, by the way I am starting up a PC mod businsess so.... let me mod your comp, or if it needs to be fixed the price is now a flat rate of $5. :)

      yeah, I saw sumthin' like that on E-Bay too - an underground military facility. Reminds me of the vaults in Fallout, HUUUGE stronghold with so many rooms you could rent them out for some extra cash. Its located in central Washington.  urlLink Check it out for yourself , all you need to call it yours is like $3'950.000,00.

      Over the last week or so there have many military devices/gizmos on sale on Ebay. To add to last week's tank, they are now auctioning a  urlLink F/A-18A Navy Blue Angel Hornet . And if you scroll fown on that page, you'll also see a  urlLink T-33 . The T-33 was in service during Nam, and now is being used for scouting missions in Japan. Holy Shit if I only had $1,051,501.00 I could take over the world.

      Space, the last frontier [at least for now], is now the newest cemetary.   Celestis  now offers burials in space, have your ashes oribting the Earth or spilled across the moon. The price for one gram of your cremated material to go to space is:$995.  That's just the rotate-around-the-Earth-until-you-come-crashing-down-upon-some-mexican-city-deal. The also have other ones, like the moon deal. At first I jhought that they were Kazakhtanian [since their first flight is to be from Kazakhtan] and I said okay, that's reasonable. Kazastan was the center of the Soviet Space Program, so it's understandable that they would launch people's remains into space for profit. Then I found out that they were from Texas [Houston], and I said okay that's also some what reasonable. Americans are always trying new things. Now will anyone actually go for this? Yes they probably will and when their ashes come raining down, it'll some how find its way into my eyes for saying this:  "PLEASE DON'T SEND MORE GARBAGE INTO SPACE!"

      my friend  urlLink MystFyre  made some of the following observations about Jolly Ol' Saint Nick: Here are a few calculations about santa   There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the population reference bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming there is at least one good child in each.   Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get onto the next house.   Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are not talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks.   This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second - 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a pokey 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that flying reindeer can pull 10 times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them -Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch).   A mass of nearly 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reaches the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,000 g's.   A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim considering all the high calorie snacks he must have consumed over the years) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now. MERRY CHISTMAS!!!   HOLY CRAP!!!   urlLink Sharpton got 20% of the votes in D.C.

      I have decided that the SAT isn't scored well. In fact that's why they are changing the scoring system. This is just what I think it'll look like:    Way to go! You have done better than all the other ass monkeys taking this test. You are either incredibly white and suburban or some Asian immigrant reaching for the American dream of being white and suburban.  Congrats! You are what we like to call An minority battling for their place in an society that hates them. Guess what? We don't really give a shit... In fact after all this, when you probably have your Masters, people will still hate you and care less about you. You have wasted x [years alive] of your life.  You are Mr./Ms. Average. You will get nowhere in life. You'll probably end up in some generic job doing the same thing everyday for the rest of your life. The most you can expect is to work at a factory. And by factory I mean sweatshop. And not one of those nice ones in America, no, you'll be stuck in one of those nasty ones in 3 rd  world ones, where your life will be a living hell. You will spend the rest of you life making crappy pants, in which you'll thread "Help me I'm am stuck in a sweatshop making these crappy pants!" and then no one will care.  Below average there are those of you who will be... wow it would be too easy to insult you... firstly you just pissed in your pants. Second, the only way for you to actually succeed is to move to Cuba where the SATs don't fucking matter. Hell... join the sweatshop dude  This is what the SAT should, will look like. And then I shall laugh. It sucks that I am in the last category. If only I was more of a non-Asian minority, my score would be average. Hell I should slip into the African category... I am kinda African.

In other news stuff, the higher ups and stuff from Sharman Networks and Brilliant Digital were raided by copyright officers, after getting the proper legal work from some Justice.  urlLink Full story here  as seen on Zeropaid.com.   Also, I'm all tired, and just thought to do this now, so Imma shut up, since I've got no real thought functions goin' on. Bye now!  I'm now the Zenman, and Imma haveta be off to meditate now...

It's the funniest thing I have seen all day besides when Fox 5 news kept running the sequence of Jackson's 'incident' [in quotations cause of the all crap the media is making out it]. Fox 5 is anything but news, this crappy attempts at getting ratings is almost as bad as the time they aired their commerical: "Single Moms We Know You Dish It Out."

Normals will be on the floor laughing and umm.... it's kinda kewl that they managed to do this... for years now. It's based on Tribes [*and now they use Halo, happy now you bitching whore?], and the online Catpure-the-flag game. Really great, really funny... Late last night my brother IMed me this link:  urlLink The Slacktivist . This one post made me crack, So funny... So great... such a great analogy. To reply to  urlLink this ... I have nothing to say, cause if I say something then it will be perverted and on the internet... Then people will think that I am either a flaming homosexual or a pervert...or both...LOL [don't worry it's an inside joke, very inside, like the inside of my brain...other half].

      woooow, a lot lot of nuthin's been goin' on 'round here, hasn't it? 'Bout 2 posts in over 2 weeks, but hopefully it should pick up a lil.  I bet a lot of interesting stuff happens to you people, and like...say it, I guess...I really can't be more convincing than that.  Anyway, some of you might find this kinda funny, even if u dun particularly care. The RIAA , the damn suits who've been suin' everyone who gets some bytes of music across the net, had their site inexplicably shut down for 5 days, from March 17th to the 22nd. They didn't give any comments on it, only admiting that the site was down. Possibly a virus to blame, but still kinda funny how it got 'em.  urlLink Full Story.   Lesse, sides that, not a whole lot in terms of public interest has been goin' on, really, just stuff. I'm stallin' doin' hw right now. Oh I finally got to see Underworld by way of my cable's Movies on Demand. Kick ass movie, man, seriously. Oh and, for humour, look for on the internet, movies by the flash artists Group X. Funny stuff, some might need you to have broadband, 'cause they're so big.  If you really hate the RIAA and want to kill their babies..or just wear tees that say how much you dislike them or sumthin', go  urlLink here.   Welp, off to do a bunch of other crap!

That doesn't mean that I'll stop posting here, just that I have a new one, check it out, will add it to the link bar sometime this weekend.

      I've got a new sn for AIM. "PatheticM0F0" you should probably copy/paste that to avoid error, since those are zeros. I'm havin' trouble with my previous sn, so this'll haveta do for now. Goddamn AOL bastards.  I'm still dirt sick, but I actually decided to go to like a doctor and I got m'self some meds that  should  work. We'll see. Anyway sorry about leavin' early on Friday, I was all like weak n' disoriented and felt like emptying the contents of my stomach over most of my surroundings.  There's somethin' scary goin' on and each day it seems to get the world darker and darker everyday. Filesharin's becomin' even more like a truly underground thing, and not in the way of a sub-culture, but in the way that freedom-loving information sharers like myself must now live like lowly scum that are chased after everyday for things like murder and contraband.  Every passing day, we get more uncertain, Sharman Networks, owners of KaZaA are constantly being hounded, p2p programs are getting "sitting" programs that sit in the network cutting off file transfers they detect, the RIAA's gettin' more and more aggressive, and corps all over are gettin' together to kill the ones that promote file-sharing, and come up with more and more digital encriptions for both digital information, and software/music sold in stores.  This stirrs quite a bit of a dilemma, and makes you kinda wonder about the future, should we go ahead and fight for our beliefs,  risking possibly our freedom if we get too involved, or let them take away our freedom of speech, and our rights, such as our rights to information. How could we let them restrict the flow of information? How can we let them just bottle us up like this? Maybe we will face a dark future of cyber-hackers and identity stealers, just like in all those cyberpunk films, just 'cause a few greedy execs and artists, and our corporation-fucking goverment couldn't get over their obsession with money. Well I'm not gonna lie down and take this, 'cause I'm all for freedom, and that includes the freedom of information, b/c that's all the 1's and 0's we toss across the net is...a whole lot of information no one should make a claim on. The artists and movie producers who are shared over the internet actually gain more popularity this way, and they still make way more money through concerts, events, and movie showings, so they should shut their assholes up and quit bitchin'. I don't care how bad it gets, I'l fight back anyway I can.  I'm the Zenman, share information! Protect your rights!

      did you know that ejaculations help prevent cancer. It might sound strange, but it's "true". That is what the aussie sciencists have asserted. They suggest that men should ejaculate every other day to prevent prostate cancer... I looked over their experiment (the data that they had collected is online). They performed this study over a two year period and examined men of various ages, including men around 20-29 years old. Why would they do this? These men don't have a very high chance of getting prostate cancer... oh well. still a very interesting study.

      Why is the new-post page beige?  And is that how you spell beige? ^_^  Well, this morning we had only five kids . . . Jandro was the most hysterical.  At first he was shooting at me, and then I said, "Oh no!" and he modified it to, "No!  I'm shooting  oatmeal  at you!"  What a healthy way to die?  ^_^  Then he asked me what my name was, didn't wait for me to answer before pointing and saying, "You're name is Apple-juice!"  To give him credit, he was *drinking* apple-juice at the time.  It made me think of the movie star person who named her kid Apple, except that Jandro's two so he has an excuse.  Other than that, nothing interesting.  Prom's this weekend!  We get our invitations this week, and I'm crazy excited. ^_^  Getting our nails done, skipping school Friday, getting dressed up and all fancy.  Yay!  Much less excited about the softball playoffs - everyone should come and watch me do something remarkably stupid in centerfield, because I always do.  Or watch me sleep in centerfield . . . I do that, too.  See you guys later -Apple-juice ^_~

      But I'm fucking back. Hello bastards. You all thought u got lucky, never havin' to see ME again...well go back to pullin' out your lashes, and recount your lucky stars, 'cause I'm frickin' back.  Risen from the dead, my computer's back on track, after like 3 weeks of shit it gave me, and 4 days of shit I gave it to fuckin' fix it. So far, its been 'round 3 comps fixed: Hyperspaz's first, then mine, and then Dollface's; the girls havin' had their comps upgraded to XP. Thanx to Conrad, and my help, Hyper's comp was restored to..better condition (it better be) after that assholian virus she posted about that thoroughly raped her comp. Mine was too thoroughly violated up the out-hole, and had to be checked into rehab, and Dollface was tired of her comp's crap and decided to give it a full facelift. I think Conrad needed to fix his up too, dunno how that went.  'Sides all this shit, I come back and the blog's all purty and fancy-lookin' and shit. In a few days (I hope) I will have finally gotten around to making the new face for the new home of this weblog, for all you bitches to enjoy. In the meanwhile, keep dreamin', I'll never be gone!  I'm the Zenman, and no school proxy's gonna see this shit.  "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck"

      You know that you're a geek when your super asks you for help with his computer. This isn't your family, friends or even distant a long lost relative. No, this is your super. That's what happened to me today, frankly I'm not even that close to my super. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't even know my name, but then how the hell did he know that I work with computers? His computer is running Windows ME and is laced with Spyware (this is the computer he doesn't use). Anyways he wanted me to help him install his cable modem which won't install properly. This entire thing was a catch-22. To install the cable modem, you have to defeat the mongol like hordes of spyware, but in the process the computer freezes over and then you have to restart the whole thing over. Deleting the registry/source of the spyware doesn't help cause the computer freezes during that process too. This whole thing was such a pain in the neck.  In other news school's almost over and then FREEDOM! Not going to prom? Then talk to Zhang or me or... Yu or me... haha I made a funny... maybe not

      Well, word of advice to all those out there, people suck!  Ok kiddies, story time of how this one here, ie me, screwed up majorly and is suffering from the consequences, but not really.  Following me?  So, some of you have heard this and some of you haven't, but I don't really care and feel like ranting anyway, so sit throught it, grab a cup of tea, and imagine me saying this in a really really LOUD voice.....so here it is...     So yesterday, I received an email from a Izho@hunter.cuny.edu, and I figured, "hey, it's from hunter, why would they be sending me crap, I should open this."  Then, it led to a blank email, and a download.  Naive me, thinking, "well, I did sign up for some session thing, and the heading was 'information', it's probably telling me something about it."  So I downloaded it.  And as I tried to open it, it failed, couldn't open, I was kicked offline, and could not get back on without it freezing.  I mean, I just feel stupid.  I should've figured it was bad just by looking at the email...imagine ghetto talk... I'z a hoe !  Come on, I should've known!    But funny thing, it's just messing with my aol 9.0.  I went into my windows explorer and was about to delete the 8.0, and decided, "eh, why don't I just try", and it worked.   Yay!    Oh, AND my anti-virus doesn't work!  Anyone can help with that??  I think I'd need it.  So there goes my rant...my LOUD rant and I hope you all enjoyed me talking to myself in front of my computer.  Thank you and good night.  *And close curtain*

      Yup, yesterday, or whenever that was, sure was nice. Cool t'have some hang outs even tho we're all outta school. Really hope we can still do that. Heard 'bout sumthin' like that hap'nin' Saturday, but I dun even know if I can make it. I'm also busy alluva sudden, and this fuckin' ill's kinda caught up with me.  I went to the doc's to see what the fuck's wrong with me. Turns out I've got a throat infection of some sort, and it's not viral so he gave me some antibio's. 5 day treatment of Zithromax® (gotta have that "®" there) and that shit has some pleasant side-effects - I would've rather stuck with the infection. Reason I felt so incredibly weak and nauseous is b/c the thing affected my digestive system first, must've been introduced there first some how, and probably interfered with my absorption of nutrients.   Heh, I saw that commercial again for those "Brush Ups" things. You know, the very bumpy things that people slip over their fingers and can brush their teeth anywhere! Sooo gonna get discontinued: those things look like french ticklers! You know some sick individual(s) is/are already out there up to no good with those.  Oh yeah, I got a cut card...for the last day of school. Appareantly I never went to get my diploma or my report card, both of which are actually right next to me, and, according to the cut card, my continued absence could put my school success in peril...  Well, I'm the Zenman, and...wow...that's some impressive stupidity...  "Did you say the F-word?" "No, that's not my kind of thing" "Did you curse at him" "Maybe" (Paraphrased)

      Hung out all together to day...got pictures from Summer.  They were niiice and full of joy.  Stuff to remind us of our youth in 20 years, wondering where it had all gone, as it leaves us crying on the inside.  Yes, now that that's over with...it was fun today.  There was an abundance of food and company.  Maybe too much...hmm...possible?  I've decided that I love those dots.  Forgot what they are called though...they help a lot with the flow of thoughts.    Joke of the day, week, month...it's so great, it's last forever:   What do you get if you cross Peter Parker with a Potato?   Answer:   Spuderman!!!   HEHEHEHE, yes, I know I'm sad.

      I finally got my pictures developed!  Some of them are really funny . . .and some of them are just really bad.  Ah, the joys of grainy, instant film.  Fortunately for me all the graduation ones came out looking really bad, or I would've had mementos of the principal talking about Brown v. the Board of Education (without which she wouldn't be here to not know that we exist).  Other than that, not much going on.  BU isn't giving me enough money, and orientation is this week.  I've got to pick classes, and take a language, and meet people.  Creepy people.  Then it's off on vacation and more pictures.  ^_^  Much love!

      now i'm lost...i took dante's test..yet again to see if i would still end up in the 8th level of hell....and...i'm lost!! cuz now i'm in purgatory!!....so confused lol...well thats better.    The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to Purgatory!  Here is how you matched up against all the levels: Level | Score Purgatory | High Level 1 - Limbo | High Level 2 | High Level 3 | Very Low Level 4 | Low Level 5 | Low Level 6 - The City of Dis | Very Low Level 7 | Moderate Level 8- the Malebolge | High Level 9 - Cocytus | Very Low  and i cant figure out why....i think i put in the same answers, except maybe this time i put in that i asked for forgiveness???  that one answer and my results COMPLETELY changed.  well my ratings seems to be the same....baaaah  so we graduated....and i have nothing to do!! lol we all need to hang out

(Not that you don't already, or anything, but that's not the point!)  Stupid vision.  *pouts*  I am *not* happy about this.  *sighs*  Okay, I guess that was my rant for the day.  Other than that, I've been momentarily freed from the weight of relatives, and am living the high life on vegetable lasagna and Zenman's strange IM's.  But I'm not eating the latter - or am I? ^_^  *sticks out tongue* Not much to say, just doing my bit to try and keep this poor besotted creature we call *blog* alive. Much love!

      Holy friggin' crap. So much stuff's been hap'nin' recently. The days've been frickin' flyin' by (though I wouldn't've minded if the regents had flown by just a lil faster.) But the hrs after regents were awesome. We all hung out in the park n' shit. Nice to all of us hang out as friends, 'cause we don't enough, and we haven't really yet.   Oh and besides that.......HOLY CRAP, YAHOO just got so much fuckin' better. They've increased the limit for attachments from 1 mb, to TEN FRIGGIN' MB. As a long time Y! mail user, this is significan't. Furthermore, and the best shit yet...its not your regular 3mb mail limit...it isn't you 6mb, like they had...not ONLY does junk mail not count to that limit...but its also...a 100mb mail limit! Now that's just awesome.  Besides that, Imma save the sappyness for a post after we'll all haveta part ways, but seems half the circle's gonna know eachother better for a fine time longer.  Welp, until I find more stuff to write about...  This is the Zenman...ohhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmm....uh...more bhuddist gibberish....  "So I took out this big-ass knife, right? But THEN, it turned out the giant lobster I was fighting, WASN'T a giant lobster! It was Elizabeth Taylor! And that big-ass knife I pulled out, wasn't a big knife I pulled out! It was a big-ass sardine I pulled out! Needless to say, I gave that bitch one helluva fish-smack! THWACK! Fish guts EVERYWHERE."

      what I'm not sure exactly.  Pleasant day, ignoring the regents.  Though that was occasionally *also* funny - yes, I'm weird, do you have a problem with that? ^_^  Loverly loverly time at Central Park, rolling around in the grass and throwing the frisbee badly.  Quite fun, though depressing to watch all the other people who are better than we are.  Kind of sleepy . . .thinking of gondolas . . .or is it gondoliers I'm thinking of?  Wouldn't you like to know?!  We're graduating . . .and I'm still not smart. ^_^

Extememly!  There is only the US history regents and graduation left, but then we're all out.  I really do hope we keep in contact, who else am I going to make fun of?  I neeeeeeeeeeeeeed you!

The girls did their nails today and turned out beautiful...damn bubbles...and yes, I will be obsessive about them.  But still very nice nonetheless.    I was hoping that I would have an amusing anecdote today, but unfortunately, I don't.  So, kind of disappointed by that...but ahh, just so excited!!  See you tomorrow, lads and lassies

      So the Zen-man has left for his vacation, leaving dollface and I offically bored.&nbsp; But As she will have a job soon, it will work out for her.&nbsp; Not that I'm loathing in self-pity or anything....noo.... On to other things more pleasent, we went to visit hunter today and ran around in circles trying to find out any type of information possible.&nbsp; Then somehow lost all sense of direction and was not able to tell east from west, north from south, up and down, by the end of the day.&nbsp; Quite interesting when we started floating.&nbsp; Ended up at Central Park where we were devoured by flies and spoke words of love and peace to each other.&nbsp; Yes the flies were talking to each other, such soulful creatures.&nbsp; Can you people tell I'm kind of sleepy?&nbsp; I sure hope so.&nbsp; Anyhoo, it's hot so where ever you people are and should you actually decide to read, I bid you good journey/ies.&nbsp; Whichever, have fun.

I actually did wake  up earlier and i COUUULDVE gone..but no..cuz pathmark is in queens and  a good 45 minutes walk..soo..noo..no thanks.  yea and this  morning's light..craaaaaaazy...i guess i'm readying myself for  work....bah..working with 6th graders!!

      Well, my flight leaves at some insanely early hour tomorrow morning, and my mom's been living on the internet recently, so it's doubtful I'll get to talk to any of you again before I take off.  I'm going to miss you all terribly, and will hopefully be in touch as often as email allows - or whenever I get sick of Sedgie and pass the time by writing you postcards.  Oh, completely random point. Mr. Fried was all proud of this quote in his classroom that said, "Never doubt that a small group of committed individuals can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." (Margaret Mead)  And then, this week's Onion, in one of the horoscopes, said, "Never doubt that a small group of committed individuals can change the world with a vial of smallpox virus and a few kilograms of plutonium."  On that note, I leave you for London.  Bye, guys.

      It's the forth and fireworks will be a-blazing.  It was funny today.  My dad decided to go to Coney Island, so we went...and saw the Hot Dog eating contest!  It was annoying, but oddly fascinating when the event actually started.  Way too crowded, way too many people, way too hot, but enjoyable nonetheless.  Weird!  What's even more peculiar are the fighter jets flying by my neighborhood...boy do they cause a ruckus.    I hope everyone enjoys whatever they do today...be it with family or nothing at all.  But the sky will be on fire, and that's something to look forward to...even if they get boring oh so fast.

      Well, BU Orientation is over.  I officially have a class schedule!!  It's weird - I feel like I should be a college student now, or grown up, or something.  But the nice thing is that my first class is at nine (Introductory German . . .yes, the drugs I'm on *are* nice, since you asked. ^_^) and my last one ends at two thirty.  So, not bad at all.  I'm taking an English, a "conceptual" science class (Hyper, I got the English accent guy!), ummm . . .something on the American Revolution, and Intermediate Yoga.  I was going to take Beginning Yoga, for fairly obvious reasons, but it was all full so I'm taking intermediate.  How good are people in intermediate yoga?  I'm kinda worried now.  *frowns*  Is this class at the point where I'm supposed to have found inner peace - or even a sense of balance, cause I haven't done that yet!  I leave for the UK in almost exactly a week - I'm entirely freaked out.  And I'm going to miss all of you guys like crazy.  No, more than crazy.  Heck, orientation was too long away from you strange and fascinating people, how am I going to survive almost two months, and then school???  Oh, right, and about *school*.  There were over six hundred kids at the orientation, right?  I saw Eve, right?  These people were too white and preppy for Eve.  She called them "jappy," which they were, but without the jewish, really.  All the girls wore the short summer skirts and tank tops with the long Jennifer Aniston hair and were all flirting with the guys - all of whom had on striped polo shirts, khaki shorts or pants, and backwards beat up baseball caps.  I'm going to *school* with these freakishly normal upper middle class Americans!  *screams*  And they're all going to be accountants or lawyers and I swear the only good thing to come out of this had better be a white guy for Hyper . . .and anyone else who might want one.  C'mon Zenman, I know you do. ^_~  I guess that panic attack is all for right now - oh, but right, I have a cell phone!  It's for emergencies or something, and my aunt won't tell me the minute plan so I'm really afraid to use it except for after nine pm and before midnight, but still, it's weird.  Probably only keep it this summer.  Still weird.  It's some GSM plan or something.  All right, I'm rambling . .off to bed.  G'night!

      I have officially become a civil servant.  First day of work is completed and I am already considering quitting.  I don't think it's a good thing, but it could just be something akin to stage fright where I feel like there's so much pressure.  But I could handle it right now, so it's not that bad.  The people are nice, for the most part.  Very ghetto.  Everyone is really protective of their cash registers...understandable cuz they don't wanna be over or under, but I didn't think it'd be so...roar!  Funny customer story.  So there was this lady who took forever ordering.  It was, "well, I think I'll have.....umm.....maybe......umm...."  So on so forth.  When she FINALLY ordered, the guy that was helping was telling me what to do and explaining what she ordered.  As he was doing that, the lady was like, "I'm just gonna go over here!  This is taking forever, I'm on a busy schedule!"  This coming from the lady who took like 5 minutes to order while standing in front of the register.  Hypercritical much???  So yes...civil servant.  I shall now go and kill myself.  Thank you, please come again.

It was weird, I went to their open house, had an interview, took some assessment test (involved legos and screws), had another interview, and was hired!  It was easier than I thought it would be.  Although they made it sound like the job was full of sweeping and cleaning...hmm...what have I gotten myself into?

      i've got bangs! and layers and my hair is freakishly short lol well for me at least.  cut it yesterday...mom did it..but i'm still getting used to the idea.  its amazing how anime-ish i can look...which is kinda wierd.  probably if i stroked some hair glue into my hair it'd get all crazy looking.  now i look even more so like an asian person..which is nice...so it really was my long hair that sorta made me look mexicanish....and my big flat nose lol wonder how i'll feel about my new hair in a couple of days...it was so spontaneous..but i was really thinking of doing it for some time..my hair was just too long. BOREDOM has pretty much captured me...and fear for my upcoming work....6th graders...*shiver*
