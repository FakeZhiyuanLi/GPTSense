      I'm starting a whole new blog...the other one was kinda a mess, and it's easier to just start all over.  I decided not to quit blogging...I have too much to say! I'll probably post several times over the summer, especially about the SMITE trip.  Please, keep all the comments nice, and please leave your real name.  Thanks.  Quick shout out to my Bahamas girls.  I love you all so much!  We're gonna have a blast! Let's make it an INCREDIBLE trip, not a long one.  lol  Eve- You crack me up! We're gonna have a blast together! Be careful not to sleep with a quacking duck...it'll scare you.  lol. Thanks for always adding your random humor to everything!  Emily- You are my best friend so you will keep me sane.  I'm so glad we're both going to Bahamas!  We have so many memories, so let's add a bunch of great memories after this summer! Thanks for always being there.  Angela- I don't know you very well, but I know that after this summer we'll be better friends.  You're really cool and I can't wait! It's gonna be so much fun!  Rebecca- I have way too much fun with you! I can tell you anything and everything.  Our "dances" are hilarious.  Let's see how many we add after Bahamas (yes I know there will be many) and we'll work out a routine at BJ. haha.  I can't wait to spend 2 weeks with you! It's gonna be a blast!  Amanda- Girl, I love you so much! I'm looking foward to Bahamas so much! We have had so much fun together so I know this will be great! (no more fights lol)  You're awesome!

      I love my youth group.  I haven't always had the best attitude about it, because a lot of the rules can be pretty strict, but we all know how to have so much fun.  It's my youth group and I want to do all I can to be involved and make it a better place.  I am really beginning to value the time I spend with the people in my youth group.  I don't know if that's because I'm around unsaved people all summer, or because it's beginning to hit me that I only have 2 more years left.  Whatever the reason may be, it's made me want to make the most of everything I do with them.  The people are so open and loving.  Last night at the Prelocks I had so much fun.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  Being able to talk about God without being criticized is an awesome privilegde.  I look up to so many of the people and love spending time with them.  I know many people that are in our youth group don't come to many things because they think it's boring.  I think it's all about the attitude you have.  If you go into something thinking it's going to be boring, you'll have no fun.  But if we all step it up and start coming to things and make it fun, we could have a blast.  We have great leaders who really care about us.  They're not out to get us or make us miserable.  They only give us rules because they love us and care about us so much.  I know last night was a blast, but I also know that many more people could have come.  So let's change our youth group.  We have so much potential.  The more people that come, the more fun we will have.  Let's make this summer a great summer for our youth group.

      Yes, it is finally over- Alpha and Omega trip.  What an experience it was.  It was fun, stress, comotion, more fun, more stress, hurt, pretty much everything bundled into 24 hours.  It was a VERY beneficial experince though.  I have learned so much through it.  Planning an activity like this one is really complicated.  I thought I had to have everything go as planned.  Well, it didn't.  Wednesday night, a few details weren't together, the schedule was a little off, and a few other minor details, and I freaked.  I was a wreck already.  It wasn't the best night.  Thank God for friends that care about me.  Then I wake up Friday morning to find out that it's pouring down rain.  Seeing as there was flooding, I was pretty sure the campout wouldn't happen, but I had no clue.  When I found out that we were staying at church and that it wasn't starting until 5:00, I was a basket case.  I had done all this work that I thought would go down the drain.  The schedules were completely wrong, the games wouldn't work, I was sure nothing would work out at all.  The SMITE team arrived at 11:30 to replan the trip.  It took me a really long time to get into the spirit of things, and when I tried to just enjoy myself I had so much fun, but for the majority of the time I was a crab.  I felt like I had nothing to do with the trip at all because all my stuff got cut, and my schedules didn't work.  I learned how inflexible and self centered I really am.  Unfortunately, I didn't treat some of my friends as well as I should have, and for that I am truly sorry.  I guess I'll have to chalk this one up as anther lesson I learned the hard way.  But even though nothing went according to schedule, it all worked out great and people had a blast!  I can't wait until next year, and I will not be making thoes mistakes again.  I had so much fun working with my SMITE friends and learned the value of team work and using your time well.  Alex, Joe, and Mike~ I had fun hanging out with you guys.  You're awesome guitar players! Hope I'm a good "manager" lol!  Eve, Angela, and Rebecca~ I know you don't realize this, but being around you guys always calmed me and made me enjoy myself.  Thanks!  Emily~ Thanks for always being there and letting me wear your shirts...lol  Amanda~ You helped me calm down and realize that everything was going to work.  Thanks for always being there for me to talk to and for cheering me up!  Robbie~ YEAH FBI TEAM CAPTAIN!!! I had fun working with you.  You were awesome!  Wilbo and Jaybo~ you two crack me up!! It wouldn't have been the same without you!  Nathan~ We'll have to talk--soon.  I'm sorry and thank you for everything.  Amanda and Courtney~ I had fun getting to know you better.  It was a blast!  Hopefully we all learned things from this that we can carry over to our Bahamas/Peru trip.  I can't wait!

      Life has been so weird lately...I don't totally know what to think.  Everything is twisted; my feelings, thoughts, emotions, actions.  I feel like my world is spinning out of control.  Take work for example.  I love it so much.  The people are great this year.  Convertables- HAHA JAMES!, jokes of the day, speedos (come'n Jake, you know you want them), drive ins, I could go on and on of all the funny things that have happened.  Last year I hated work, this year I love it.  Then there's SMITE.  Planning Alpha and Omega has been fun...kind of...I seem to once again taken a lot of it on myself.  This week I have to teach the lesson for SMITE, finish a ton of stuff for Alpha and Omega, practice the music..AAHHH! I don't have any time.  Then there's my friends.  People who I once loved are bugging the crap outta me, the ones I hated I now love, it's so weird.  I don't know who likes me, who hates me.  This week everything comes together...or so I hope.  I work 10:30-7 every day except Wednesday where I work 10:30-4, SMITE from 5-6, VBS training from 6-8, and music practice from 8-9. Full day.  I really wish Amanda were home.  I need to talk with her a lot.  My relationship with her is weird.  Now, we get along great and I love her to death.  Before was a different story..but I'm gald it's all good now.  I feel like I've called her 100 times in the past 2 weeks lol.  Never sign up for the activities committee for Alpha and Omega= EVERYTHING is an activity!!!  Somehow I got stuck putting together the schedules, and there's so much that still needs to be done.  Amanda has been my other brain on this, and I need her!! All I have to say is that if you sign up for a committee, do your part.  It makes everyone happy in the end.  Don't get me wrong, everyone in the activities group has been great, but some have done a lot more than others.  Well, I just hope it all works out in the end.  Then the whole polo shirt deal.  It's a freakin polo shirt so GET OVER IT!!! Sorry I had to vent.  Well, I have to go get ready for work. This has been my post for the month, I probably won't be back until after the Bahamas trip..busy life.  Pray everything falls into place for Alpha and Omega, because if it doesn't, it lands on us!!

      In two days, I am leaving with my SMITE team to go to the Bahamas! I can't wait!  This whole SMITE experience has been so good for me.  We've been training since January.  I've learned so much through our studies, and I know that I will learn so much more on our trip. We're leaving from church at 3:30 on Saturday morning, our flight out of Indy leaves at 7:00, we get into Miami around 10:45, then we get to sit in the airport for almost 4 hours.  We end up getting to the Bahamas around 6 or 7 I think.  We will get back to church around 9:30 at night on July 31.  Please pray for traveling safety, outreach, and group unity.  It should be a great, life changing trip! *A quick note to my team- I have never met a cooler, more Godly group of people.  I love you all so much (even though I don't always show it).  It's gonna be awesome!*  And he won a free book off the radio.

      I have been studying the life of Christ with my SMITE group.  We are studying self denial and how Christ's ministry on earth was all about others.  This has been one of the best studies I have ever done.  Everything Christ did here on earth was to help others, heal others, or teach others.  I need to develop that mentality.  So often I get caught up in my world and everything I have to do, that I forget to take a look around me and see all those hurting that I could help.  I loved Amanda's blog  urlLink Something I've Noticed .  Everything she said is so true.  Another trap I fell into is that I get so caught up in the activity that I forget that my real ministry is the people.  I'm leaving for my SMITE trip to the Bahamas on Saturday and my biggest prayer is that I won't get so worried about making sure everything is perfect and on schedule.  IN the scheme of things, who cares if game time goes a little long, or if the craft time gets cut short?  As long as I am focusing on the people and really trying to reach out to them.  The Bahamas is a third world country, so I am imagining that these people are going to be very poor.  It is going to be unlike anything I have ever seen before.  I really want to touch their lives in a special way.  I want to deny myself and focus on them.  Our theme verse for SMITE is Matthew 6:24 "...Deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow Me."  That is a huge commandment.  I want to follow Christ.  Taking a look at Christ life, he was always around people.  He was never too tired to help them, he never needed some alone time, he never said no.  His ministry on earth had a huge impact on everyone.  Obviously, I can never have as big an impact as Jesus did, but I can have an impact on everyone around me.  The way I can do that is by each and every day giving myself to God.  I need to do what he wants me to do, not what I want to do.  One of my favorite songs is by Tree63, Over and Over Again.  The chorus says "I give myself away every single day, over and over again.  You're the only thing that's true, and I give myself to you over and over again."  The lyrics to that are so powerful.  In order for me to deny myself, I need to follow Christ.  In order to follow Christ I need to give everything to Him.  Each and every day, I need to devote my life to Him.  I need to do that over and over again.

      Summer has flown by, but it has been one of the best summers I've ever had! VBS, interesting as it was, was some fun.  That week was an emotional one though.  I think I was in an onry mood or something.  I snapped at people about everyday.  One person in particular,(sorry nathan), but it's all good now. Then that Sunday was a full day.  I had orchestra from 11:30- 2:00.  Then Nathan and I went over to PW's for the last 5 minutes of the leadership lunch, then I went home.  For about an hour and I was off to church once again.  VBS closing program.  After that we ended up helping put all the decorations away in the barn..what an adventure.  You'd think we could come up with at least 1 truck, sseeing as like all the guys have trucks, but all we had was Amanda's jeep and Mike's girly car. (sorry mike, the mustang is better, i don't care what year it is.)  That took a while.  Then we went to Fazoli's.   It was fun.  Jared rearranging the restaurant, the universal breadstick call, what could be better.  haha! Some people decided to go to Dan's to watch Zoolander, so we took Eve home, then Kelsy home, and somewhere along the way my shoe got thrown out the door by Jaybo.  Then we get in Jaybo's dad's old stick, where the dashboard light doesn't work so we had no idea how fast we where going.  That along with Amanda's backseat driving...good times, good times.  Haha.  Last week was Talents for Christ Nationals in Chicago.  Actually it was in St. Charles right out of Chicago.  I had so much fun.  Although I didn't place, I came away with a great experience and many great memories.  Weird judges (haha eve), TGIF, magic guys, Justin's stories, shoes, Target, Leuker (what???), Regis and Kelly, Target Furniture, Nathan's magic tricks, I could go on and on.  This week I've been at work a lot.  I don't really like my job anymore, but the people are great.  Thunder and Lightning charades with Will, pink whistles, Jim and Adam's defence class, great times. The fourth was a good day too.  I love the pig roast.  I stabbed Jaybo with a fork and made him bleed.  haha! Lots of orchestra stuff that day.  It was fun though.  I went to Slaytor Hill and listened to some of the music with Nathan, Matt, and Turza.  Learned how to brigde when I shuffle (sorta), watched the fireworks.  THe fireworks were fun..even though some other stuff happened.  Aaron- I do NOT want you to sit on me!! lol.  Now we leave for SMITE in less than 10 days!! I can't wait! There's still a ton to do, but it will all work out. The people in my SMITE group are great.  I'm actually getting along with just about all of them.  It's gonne be a great trip! Life's been pretty good lately.  Well I've rambled for long enough.  I'm out. And he won a free book off the radio.

      Summer is almost over...and I am not at all ready to start school. This summer has certainly flown by. After we got back from the Bahamas, it seems like I haven't even had much of a summer. Between work, church, and now FMT practices have started, I've been pretty busy. I pity all you Delphi students who have to start school tomorrow. Our retreat is on Monday and Tuesday, schedule day on Wednesday, Band on Thursday (9-2:30...long time), and then school on Friday. Basically you could say we start Monday. Even though I don't want to go back, August 20 is still coming. So I might as well have a good attitude about it. Every year I tell myself that this is going to be "the year". The year I make straight A's, the year I reach out to everyone, the year I really make a difference. I normally start out strong, but after a few months, I'm back to the old me, living for myself. So this year I've decided not to jump into the year with thousands of expectations and huge goals, but rather with one goal. I want to deny myself during this school year. I want to push the focus off me and out in on others. OUr school theme is Loving God Through Loving Others. I think that's a great theme- thanks Jordan! God must really trying to be teaching me that I am too self focused. Last year the theme was Leading With a Servant's Heart...and sadly I don't think I applied that to the extent that I should have. Then I've been studying self denial since January with my SMITE team, and now loving God through loving others. This year I really do want to reach out to the people in my school. If I learned one thing in the Bahamas it was how much me taking a little time to focus on the other people can effect them. All I need to do is sacrifice a little time and really love someone, and it could make such a difference in their life. I don't always realize how big of an impact I could make on someone. I get so wrapped up in my world that I forget to step outside and take a look at all the hurting people. So I'm not starting out my Junior year trying to be the best at everything. I'm starting out with a different attitude though. An others oriented attitude. Hopefully, there will be some lives that are helped through that. Enjoy your few days left of summer...and have a great school year!  And he won a free book off the radio.

       Well I'm back from the Bahamas...with mixed emotions. I'm glad to see my family and everything, but I really want to go back. I never expected to become so attatched to these people. It was definately the trip of a lifetime. I'll probably blog more about it later, but I have so many memories, deeper friendships, learned many lessons, it was a great experience. The first week we ran a VBS. I had no idea what we were in for. It was a really difficult, tiring week, but boy was it worth it. The living situations these kids come from is really sad. I've never broken up so many fights in a week. Thursday was especially bad. We had 2 huge fights. Some of the kids were so cold. But just when we were beginning to feel discouraged, God chose to bless our efforts and 7 kids came to know Christ that night. I think we had 14 or 15 in total accept Christ during VBS. Pastor Woodall one night asked us the question "Why these kids? Why here? Why us?" I thought about it for a long time. Why did God choose to have us run a VBS for some of the most horribly behaved kids? Why did God want us to spend the majority of the time at VBS disciplining them? Then Thursday, the worst day, it hit me. These kids needed to be reached out to. These kids needed to hear the message of salvation. They needed attention. If God had given us 50 little angels like we might have wanted, those 15 kids would not be going to Heaven now. Although at the time dealing with 100 kids who started fights for everything seemed tiring, dissapointing, and hard, it was the best thing. God really does know what He's doing. I have so much more faith in Him just from that little experience. It was a hard week, but I would do it again in a heart beat. Then we got to know some of the adults and teens during the youth conference the next week. It's hard not being with them now. It's so reassuring, knowing that I'll see some of them someday in Heaven. Overall the trip was wonderful. There will now be 27 more souls in Heaven someday, we all learned many lessons, I feel much closer to God, and I developed some friendships that will last for an eternity. One of the biggest encouragements on the trip was my team. When something wasn't going my way, or I wasn't being very flexible in an area, they would calmly tell me that we could all have to be stretched in many ways during this and that they were praying for me. They encouraged me to keep going and not give up. To my Bahamas sisters~ You were all great! So many memories and great times shared. The curse (yeah ang! you beat it!), rearranging the showers, bleacher talk, breaking showers (that was the best thing that happened), Miss Syr's jokes...I could go on and on of the many great memories. I love you all to death! Thanks for making the trip even better than it already was. To my Bahamas brothers~ There's one word that describes you all: FUNNY! I laughed so hard at you guys. Luke digging for buried treasure, Will's noises, Robbie scaring Amanda in the sand, so many funny times. You guys were all awesome and I'm glad we all go t to go together. All in all, it was the best trip I've ever taken. I miss the Bahamian people so much and I want to go back. Maybe someday...  And he won a free book off the radio.
