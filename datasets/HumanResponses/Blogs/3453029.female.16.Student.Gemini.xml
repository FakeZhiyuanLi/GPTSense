      Yesterday was a lot of fun! I went with my dad and one of his friends to the concert at Freedom Weekend Aloft.  Jason Mraz, Fuel, and Live were the ones that performed at the concert!  They were all really good!  I think Jason Mraz was my favorite though!  He has a really good sense of humor and he seemed really nice...plus...his music was a little more low key than the other two! The only bad thing was that I forgot to change into tennis shoes before we left, so I had on these big brown lace up dress boots, and since we had a long way to walk when we got there, I've got five blisters on the bottom of my feet now!  It really sucks! Anyway, we left at 11:30 and the band, Live, was still playing.  We still hadn't eaten anything so, we stopped at The Waffle House to get a bite to eat, since it was the only thing open that late.  LOL!  So, it was a fun night! Then, since today is Memorial Day, we had a cook out here at my granny's.  It's been fun so far.  I''ve mostly been sitting around just watching movies. I just finished watching A Walk To Remember!  One of my favorite movies!  I cry everytime!  Well, I'm outta here!

      OMG!!  I just got back from seeing the new movie "The Day After Tomorrow"!!!  It was the best disaster movie I've ever seen!  It's got incredible special effects and a cool storyline.  Plus, it's got two hot guys in it, Jake Gylanhall and Austin Nichols, so...they would make ANY movie good! I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone!  So, get up from your computer, call up a few of your friends, and go see "The Day After Tomorrow"!  You won't regret it, I promise!  I wouldn't even mind going to see it again!

      Today has been a really semi-boring day!  First of all, I didn't wake up until 11:00 this morning and I went to bed at like 12:30 AM, so I had like...11 hours of sleep!  Now, that's lazy!  Then, I realized I had a luncheon w/ my grandma.  It only took me about 30 minutes to get ready...from trying to get woken up!  So, it wasn't that bad!  But, then I had a doctor's appt. at 3:30!  It takes forever to get there too!  I don't think we got out of there either until about 5:00!  IT was crazy!  Now, I'm just waiting to hear from my best friend, Kim.  She might be coming over for a while to hang out! Should be fun!

      Ever since I saw the preview to The Notebook, I've wanted to see that movie so bad!  I had heard about how good the book was, but I just never thought about reading it.  The preview is being played a lot lately and I finally decided I wanted to read the book b/c the preview is so breathtaking and some parts make u smile, but it also makes you wonder which guy the girl (Allie) will choose.  Will it be the one that's the right choice...or the one she's *meant* to be with?  I couldn't take it anymore so I decided to buy the book Monday night.  Right when I got home I started reading it.  I couldn't put it down.  Just within the first 20 pages, I had already cried at some parts.  I think I read until it was 12:30 in the morning.  I had to make myself stop and go to bed.  Right when I woke up the next morning, my nose was right back into the book!  I finally finished it last night.  Tears were flowing down my cheeks.  It was one if not *the* sweetest, breathtaking, and unique books I have ever read!  About an hour after I had finished reading it, the preview came on and the tears started falling again!  LOL!  You can't help it after you read this incredible book!  Now, I cannot *wait* until the movie comes out!  Me, Laura, Emily, and my mom will be at the very first showing!  We can't wait!  So, if you're looking for a great and sincere book to read for the summer...get The Notebook! But, beware...it *is* a major tearjerker!  "The romantics would call this a love story, the cynics would call it a tragedy.  In my mind it's a little bit of both, and no matter how you choose to view it at the end, it does not change the fact that it involves a great deal of my life and the path I've chosen to follow." - Noah Calhoun, The Notebook (a novel)

      You know how ur sweet sixteen is supposed to be a BIG thing and ur supposed to have a HUGE party and invite a lot of people?  Well, mine wasn't like that.  It was a BIG deal for me, but I didn't invite a lot of people.  At first, I wasn't going to be able to have a party at all b/c of financial problems we're having, but my parents finally decided I could, but it couldn't be big.  I didn't care.  I just wanted to make it memorable!  I invited eleven people and seven showed up!  It ended up being me, Stevie, Heather, Kim, Laura, Emily, DAnny, Riggins, and my cousin Jen. We had a cook out at my house from 7:00-8:00, then we all just sat around the table and talked. It was so much fun!  Around 8:30, we decided to have the cake b/c Stevie kept saying she was starving, even though she had just finished eating a burger and chips, and then I opened my gifts.  I got a bracelet from Kim, a card and $20 from DAnny, a secret message pen and a necklace and a bracelet from Laura, a writing journal from Emily (since I love to write!), and a set of toe rings and an anklet and a bracelet w/ my initial on it from my aunt Judy.  Thank you all by the way for the gifts!  I loved them all!  After that we all went outside in the dark to my tire swing I have out back.  We took turns pushing each other!  It was so much fun! Then I come back inside and found Heather and Stevie chowing down on the rest of my cake!  LOL!  Finally, around 10:15, we all left for the bowling alley to go glow bowling.  When we got there, I couldn't decide who's team I wanted to be on b/c we had two different lanes and I didn't want to choose!  I hate that b/c they are all my friends and I love them all the same!  So, I decided to be on both teams!  LOL!  I went first on the team w/ Stevie, Heather, and Jen and then I went third on Laura,Emily,DAnny, and Riggin's team. But, sometimes my turn would end up being at the same time on both teams, so I'd have to run out and back to bowl!  It was so funny!  At least I got my excercise for the day! LOL!  We bowled two games, each team, and then we called it quits.  DAnny's dad came and picked him up and then Pam came to pick up Laura and Emily.  When Heather, Stevie, Jen, and I got back to my house, we all changed into out pj's, turned out all the lights, and watched Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers.  We love horror movies! Jen and Stevie were the first ones to go to sleep.  Then Heather decided she was really sleepy.  So, then it was just me! I didn't go to sleep until about 3:30, but even then, I wasn't completely asleep.  Next thing I knew, my mom was waking up me and Stevie @ 4:30 in the morning b/c her mom was coming to pick her up @ 5:00 to drive back to Pawley's Island, where they live, for church!  LOL!  We were so out of it.  When her mom showed up, we said our goodbyes and then I crashed into bed!  I was exhausted. I still didn't get much sleep tho for some reason.  Today, June 13, was my actual birthday!  It was good, but not as fun as last night was!  I have to say that my sweet sixteen birthday ended up being the best b-day I've ever had and it didn't even have to be BIG!  It was small, but it was full of fun, laughs, and best of all, friendship!  So, I want to thank all of my friends that came to my sweet sixteen b-day bash b/c you are the ones who made it all worth while!  Love ya!

      It's been a while since I've posted!  Sry to keep u waiting! :-)  Anyway, to give u an update, I got my restricted license Thursday!  I was so excited!  It was my third time trying (Shh, don't tell anyone!),but I finally got it!  You know what they say, third time's the charm!  So, I've been driving around a few times on my own.  I love it too!  So, I've been planning my sweet sixteen b-day party!  I can't wait!  It's not going to be anything big, for certain reasons, and I can only invite about 8 to 10 people, but I invited my closest friends, so it's should be a lot of fun!  I just hope everything turns out okay!  Plus, my best friend in the whole wide world is coming up from Pawley's Island on Thursday for my b-day party!  I haven't seen her since Christmas and I really miss her!  She's the most fun person you could ever meet!  We met in second grade and it took us a while, but after about five months, we became unseperable!  She moved back to Pawley's Island after we finished third grade.  But, her grandparents live here in Easley, so I get to see her a lot. I really don't know what I'd do w/o her!  So, I think this week could possibly be one of my best for the summer!  I'll let you know if that ends up being true!  Well, I'm signing off!  Buh bye!

      It's said that everything happens for a reason, right?&nbsp; Well, sometimes, I just can't figure out that reason.&nbsp;I've been told that sometimes, it could take a long time before you ever do and I believe that's true b/c I have yet to figure out why some certain things have happened to me or any of my friends.&nbsp;   I still haven't heard from that certain guy that I talked about in my previous post.&nbsp; I don't know if I ever will, but I have a feeling that sooner or later, we're bound to run into each other and even if we don't want to, we'll have to confront each other about the situation.&nbsp; There's a part of me that is scared to death of when that time comes, but another part of me knows that I really need to talk to him.&nbsp; I realized a while back that I'm not going to be able to move on or start trying to get rid of my feelings for him until I talk to him face to face.&nbsp; I just need to hear him out and talk things through.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't tell you exactly how I'll react when I see him, but I know it's going to be one of the most difficult things I'll ever have to do.  Now, one of my best friends is having trouble w/ her love life. I won't mention her name b/c I don't know if she wants everyone to know.&nbsp; Anyway, she has loved this guy for as long as she can remember and in my opinion, he feels the exact same way about her.&nbsp; She's told me numerous times about how much she cares about him and how she wishes they were more and I keep telling her the same thing.&nbsp; I tell her that she needs to let him know and tell him right now.&nbsp; If she doesn't, then she'll go the rest of her life wondering what might have been if she had told him and regretting it.&nbsp; I know that my situation didn't exactly turn out the way I had hoped, but that doesn't mean that her's won't.&nbsp; And I'm almost certain that if she did tell him the truth about how she felt, she would get her wish.&nbsp; I mean, you can tell just by the way they look at each other or act around each other that they really care for one another.&nbsp; You don't see that very often.&nbsp; Now she's found out that someone else likes him and that he just might like that someone as well.&nbsp; I told her he might just be telling her that he likes her too just to see what her reaction will be...see if she gets jealous about it b/c that's what he wants.&nbsp; But, if he does like this other girl, then she (my friend) needs to tell him now how she feels or it could be too late.&nbsp; I want more than anything for her and this guy to finally get together b/c the way I see it...they're meant for each other.&nbsp; It's true that if they are meant for each other, then they'll end up getting together on down the road, but sometimes you've got to take that leap of faith and take a chance instead of just standing around waiting for something to happen.&nbsp; So, please, if you're (my friend) reading this, think about what I'm saying and...just follow your heart...b/c I love you and I want you to have what you deserve.&nbsp; Think about it...maybe the reason you found out&nbsp;about this girl liking him was&nbsp;b/c then that would make you start rethinking things and actually get you to do the right thing and tell him how you feel.&nbsp; You think?

      Ever since I was about six years old, I've always been this hopeless romantic.  I've always told myself that I would find someone and fall in love w/ them just like in the movies, by the time I was sixteen.  Well, I did fall for someone two years ago...the thing is...he never knew it.  His name shall be anonymous throughout this whole entry.  Anyway, we had become good friends and we were constantly bickering and being mean to one another.  I didn't really realize that I had fallen for him until last Christmas.  We had become even closer and I even started thinking maybe he felt the same way.  My friends started telling me that I should make the first move, but if you know me, you would know that I'm really shy.  I've never once told a guy how I truly felt about him.  Then I started thinking that what if we really did feel the same way about each other and I just didn't know, and I would find out on down the road that if I had of said something then we would have probably been together.  I wasn't going to lose that chance.  So, I did it.  I wrote him a letter telling him exactly how I felt and all I asked in return was for him to just think about it and give me an answer.  It could be either way.  All he had to do was just say "yes" or "no".  That's not that hard right?  Well, I sent him that letter in the middle of May and it is now July 10.  At first I didn't really worry about it b/c I told him in the letter to take all the time he needed and I meant it.  Well, I get a call from my friend telling me that she saw him at Applebee's last night w/ a girl, holding hands.  I know you're prolly thinking, "Why does that surprise you?  All guys are like that!" but if you really knew him the way I *thought* I did, then you would be surprised too.  He's completely different from other guys.  He's a big christian, he likes you for who you are, and he has very valuable morals.  And he's the only guy that could ever really make me smile and laugh.  So, hearing all of this from my friend really hurt.  I sent him an email letting him know how hurt and pissed off I am about it.  So, I guess I'll just have to wait and see what his response is.  But, right now all I can think is...Love really bites!

      So this is DAnny,  urlLink Performer , updating while over the fabulous Lyncolns house. (Speaking in the words of Skylar...)  Okay so I have to wake up early this week to go to the theatre. I am helping Laura and DAnny with teaching a childrens workshop. Today we decided after it ends to go to Joes and come back to my house to type a script for their performance next friday. Have we yet? Nope, lol. We went outside to play on the tire swing. Until my cousins started attacking DAnny, so we came inside. Laura has been making me sing karaoke to "Raindrops keep falling on my head" and then "This magic magic moment". It was fun. Hopefully we can do this again.  DAnny is having such a hard time typing on this laptop. And Laura is making me sing all the songs she wants to. I feel like "Ella Enchanted". Whenever she says something to do, I HAVE TO DO IT! Its quite funny. Now DAnny & I have to sing "STOP! IN THE NAME OF LOVE".  What a fun day. Laura hasn't been on the computer basically all day. She is curing her boredom disease.   I LOVE DAnny AND LAURA. B.F.F

      Howdy! Well, I'm sorry it's been so long that I've updated this! So, I'm going to try and get you caught up. Well, I finished up w/ Dan's workshop last Friday! Thank goodness! IT was just too exhausting w/ all the early wake up calls! lol! Anyway, so after we finished up our last hour there, me, Laura, Emily, Pam, and my mom went to see "The Notebook"! I recommend that everyone go see it! It's the best romance movie I've ever seen! It's not ur typical cheesy, "like that would ever happen in real life", too dramatic and over the top romance movie. It's very unique! Just make sure you bring the kleenex w/ you! So, then that night we had to do our final performance for Dan's workshop. It turned out better than I thought it would!  After that, a bunch of us went out to Applebee's to eat. Me, Laura, Emily, Katlyn, and Katherine all sat at the same table. WE had a really cute waiter too named Nick. *sigh*! lol! We were all kidding around and came up w/ lots of inside jokes. It was storming outside and lightning and all of us saw it but Laura. We kept telling her it was lightning ,but she wouldn't believe us. Finally she saw it. lol! Then we started kidding around like it was her paparazzi following her around and taking pictures of her. Then we started kidding around about Nick. We came up with a lot of different stuff we should say to him. LIke, he gave me my receipt and I wrote, " #?" on it at the bottom. And we were all making funny winks. And then I said, "Act like I just said something funny!" and we all busted out laughing b/ it was actually funny that I said that. It was just a very funny night!  This week, I've just been resting and catching up on my sleep. It's been very nice! My mom and stepdad also surprised me this week by taking me to see "The Notebook" again. I was so happy! Then I went the next day too w/ Susannah! I still haven't even gotten enough of that movie! Today, some of the kids at Foothills Playhouse did their monologues for the 4th of JUly celebration we had today in town. Me and Laura were in that group. It was okay. Then me, my mom, and Jeff (stepdad) went back tonight to listen to The Flashbacks perform. I met Laura there. HEr and her dad came to watch the fireworks. It was fun!   Now, I've just got to be prepared for Sherri's workshop that I"m helping w/ next week! (sarcastic) Woo hoo! lol!   Are you happy now, Laura? Now you have something to read!   P.S. If there is three things of this same post, please ignore it!  My computer is completely wacked!
