      First time in my life, i entered the working world and play a part of it... Bukbuk bukbuk... My heart beats unusually fast during my first day... Keef said i was lucky to hav orientation days where there are also other new staffs coming in together... I couldn't agree more... At least, i was not alone during lunch hour...  Getting to 3 months, i start to get used to my working environment... Hav lunch buddies... Know most of the people by their name... Doesn't feel weird wearing those formal clothes... =P ... It's not as scary as i think it would be... After all, i survive this 2++ months...  There has been a little change to my lifestyle... I start to hav normal sleeping hours again... No more  bat girl  or  hantu malam ... hihi... But, i realise something... Most of my time is spent in the company... I start to appreciate my weekends... Weekends now are precious... It is the time for me to catch up some sleep... Holidays will be most welcome... Hhmmm.. when will be the next public holiday coming?  Friday will be my favourite day and Monday will be the day i hate most... Just like  Garfield ... Noever, i'm happy that i dun hav to be dependent on my parents financial wise... Sometimes, would feel happy if i able to accomplish a difficult task...  Whatever feeling i experience, this is the next stage of my life... Welcome!

      The minute i received my scroll marked the end of my student era... No more cheap RM5 movie tickets... No more discount for Svenson ice cream... No more  BIG  ang pows from uncle and aunty... But, more to many things now...  Responsibility ,  Responsibility,   & more responsibilities... There is this song's lyric: When i was just a little girl, i ask my mother what should i be? Well, i want to be a student forever (but exclude the examinations, can?) ehehehe   = P

      Today i received  a mail depicting the things we do when we are in the primary and secondary schools. It sure bring out some of my fun memories and experiences. Hmmm.... Where do should i start?  I love to play and having fun with my friends. I still do now but it will never be the same like when i was still a little girl. I'd use a 'lidi' to try to open the lock when Mom wouldn't let me go... McGuyver is a hit show at that time. I just adore him with his little tools and gadgets... Besides, I would be glued to the TV when all the cartoon shows start. Smurf, My Little Pony, Jem, Carebare, Sailormoon, Doraemon, Sesame Street, hihihi even Ultraman... At that time, there was only 1 type of Ultraman, now i have already lost counts...    Recess time or PE time is my favourite time too. Still remember i would run around the field to play 'police sentry'... Where did i get the energy to run? And, also... AEIOU (and we don't move)... Pepsi Cola (and we step on each other shoes)... Or, my friends would make the rope with the rubber band to play lompat tali... =( I alwalys had to hold the rope... Batu seremban... The 5 little 'guni sack'.... hehehehe... The guys would collect a lot of ice cream stick and colour it beautifully... And, so much more...  With my neighbours, we would always play hide and seek... Our favourite hiding place is in the 'longkang'... And, when our little brother and sister fell into the drain, we would get scolding from the parents... Ehehehehe... Serve us rite! I also remembered that we would play masak-masak in the middle of the rpad during the Moon Cake Festival... We burned the candles as much as we can and throw all the leaves and grass that we could find.. The exciting part was when we pour the water into it, the fire would rose high... Ooopss, can't let the BOMBA knows ohh...  My favourite books... From Enid Blyton, Hardy Boys, Famous Five, The Bookworms (from Singapore), to Christopher Pike and Nightmares... Aahh... and also my comics... Dragonball, Slamdunk, Detective Conan, Doraemon, & fav all time Dik Cerdas (fyi i still read it now... he's just so funny and sometimes  GROSS....     What a lovely memories.... = )

      6 August 2004... This is one of the important date in my life... As early as 5.30 in the morning, i was starting to get prepared for the day... A long  long   long  day... Arriving at Foong Ling's house at 6am, I saw her running up and down with a piece of sandwich on her hand... It has been quite some time seeing her so 'kan cheong'... hehehe...  7.30++ We started to line up and the officers gave some instructions to us. At that time, i felt i was back at school when i had to attend the assemblies... Somethings never changed... When we entered the hall of fame,  Dewan Tunku Canselor , my eyes searched for my parents... Wow, they sure sit quite in front... Later, i found out that it was actually for the VIPs... Only my father knows how to get it =p  The moment came...  Ng Chai Yee ... i looked at the pro canselor, Dr Aishah Ong (what a sweet lady)... I was afraid that when i bow, the hat would fall... Me and my  BIG  head... I smiled at her but when i walked off the stage i looked down... Aiyahh!!!! There goes my photo... =(  After 3 years of studies in the university, i'm just waiting for this moment to come... But, i'm not even at the stage for 1 minute!!! Is it worth it? Hmmmm... yep!!! If only i received the scroll from the handsome prince (hahahaha) =)

Sometimes the story is good and sometimes the story is  boringgggg .... Maybe my story will not be that great to be published in a book, at least i'm able to share it with my friends here... The person involve in my daily life will be the supporting actors or actresses and me, hehehe the  MAIN CHARACTER   here...  This will be the platform or the stage for me to present my talents (do i have one =P)... Ladies and gentlemen, let the show begin!!!
