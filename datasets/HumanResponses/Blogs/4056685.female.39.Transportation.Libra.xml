						   after our conversation on Monday afternoon - you have free reign to do as you please & if you ask, i will try to honor your request. I have a question for you... is this JUST a physical thing for you, or????? please tell me the truth. it appears the longer we discuss this - the more sexual it becomes &amp; i am getting the VERY strong impression that is all that it is? i know from my end it is not. i can surely attest to that fact, because i can & have called to talk to you about other subjects, &amp; have felt the same way for over 15 years. if we were to meet on the beach - i could walk along the shore holding your hand in mine, laughing &amp; playing in the surf, as though we were a couple newly in love. are we?????????????????

						    i would kiss your face - your neck - your throat. kiss your mouth & tease you with my tounge. i'll accept your tounge as readily as you accept mine. i shall tell you what i want, what i need &amp; what i am about to do . . . i'll kiss my way down your torso, then slowly, ever so slowly, kiss my way to heaven on earth! i don't want to stay too long, because the 1st time i want to feel you explode. i can almost feel you now. make love to me like no one ever has! if you even just kissed me right now, i would explode in a frenzy! mmm it feels soooooo good! let your imagination run wild! i will tell you my ultimate fantasy: making love on the beach (the carribbean would be perfect) on a night with a full moon, the sound of the waves crashing against the shore; our silhouettes glowing in the moonlight. you know, that is something i have always wanted to do, but have never had the opportunity - nor have i been with the right person at the right time. i often wonder if i will ever fulfull that fantasy?

						     I SUGGEST THAT IF YOU READ THE REMAINDER OF THIS LETTER, YOU ARE 100% TOTALLY ALONE -AND- BE READY FOR ANY 'PHYSICAL RELEASE' (if you know what i mean). . . . I would hate for you to have an 'accident'.....    I can honestly say this - at my age (39 now), I have done JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER WANTED TO DO & MORE! Sure, there are things that I haven't done - but only because I CHOSE NOT TO, not because of the lack of opportunity.    I have NEVER, EVER tried drugs; never experimented with them - nor have I ever used them! ( I detest people who DO use drugs! Let that be known, I do not even associate myself with people who use drugs!) I have NEVER been drunk! (I don't drink - had enough problems with both of my ex-husbands & I do not like to be around people who have had too much to drink or are drunk.) Get it? I do NOT smoke &amp; don't care for people to smoke in my presence. I have 2 rules: I DO NOT DO THE "S/M" THING & I DO NOT DO "GREEK". THE AFOREMENTIONED ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN! I WILL NOT VENTURE THERE, SO DON'T ASK &amp; DON'T TRY. Anything else is 'game'. This is just so you know where I stand on these subjects. I was a virgin until the day I got married. There are reasons I want to be with you & there are reasons that tell me I shouldn't. PLEASE: don't make me choose &amp; don't ask me to explain, just respect my feelings. I consider myself a lady - please do the same. I EXPECT to be treated as such. I don't "kiss & tell". I don't do 'one night stands' - I CAN NOT &amp; WILL NOT BE A ONE NIGHT STAND. So, how do we deal with this? For too many reasons - I could write to you exactly what it is that I want & turn you on with this letter. I don't know if that would be fair - or would it? The way you kiss me is pure unbridled passion! It takes my breath away &amp; makes me so weak that if you were not holding on to me, I'd melt to the floor. I love the way your kiss makes me feel! I want more! I love it when I am kissed on my neck, softly - then passionately. Be careful NOT to leave any marks! Whisper in my ear that you love me. . . (AND MEAN IT!); tell me what you want to do to me & what you want me to do to you. Are you solely a "conventional" kind of guy? How do you like it -and- what do you like? Making love should take time &amp; that's what you've said you wanted to do, yes?   Shall I go into detail what I like? Kiss me as though you are starving to death & you would die without my kiss. Our breath becomes one breath, our heartbeats become one beat - everything joins in unison. Hold me tight to your body as if we are one flesh, as though you were trying to mold my body into yours - that if you let go, we couldn't &amp; we wouldn't survive - one without the other. Kiss me everywhere you, yourself love to be kissed. Tease me. Do not be inhibited or shy. Play with me. Make love to me & with me as though we are the only two people on the earth &amp; nothing else matters.

						            And how are you? I hope this letter finds you doing well - I wish I could talk to you, but have no way of contacting you - outside of work. Sure, I've looked up your address online (not a difficult thing to do for me), but I would   NEVER, EVER   call you at home; unless you said it was ok. I am certain that you do not have a cell phone or a computer . . . ? You don't strike me as a person who uses such things? i might be way off base, but instinct tells me i'm right about this one! there are a lot of things my intuition tells me about you. i've always been right before when it comes to intuition & instinct! i hesitate to write, for so many reasons - mainly because i have no way of delivering a letter to you to ensure that you &amp;amp; you alone get it; but other reasons are: what if someone else sees it? would they know it was for you? would they know it was from me? i try to be as careful as possible in that respect, so that a reader would not know the identity of either one of us, by not having any information as to who "we" are. another reason is the way in which i write. does my writing make sense to you, or do i lose you because you've got to 'read between the lines' so to speak? i don't doubt your intelligence at all - it's just that there are things i can't come right out & say (in case someone else reads this) &amp; it wouldn't be too difficult for anyone to put 2+2 together to figure us out. i have   A LOT   to lose if that happened & i can't afford to lose THAT   you still can't (or won't) say "I Love You"  . . . even when we are alone? are you confident of what you feel? Is it "LOVE" - or - is it just a "PHYSICAL" thing? i've always said 'i love you' &amp; i DO LOVE YOU - DEARLY! i have for so many years. i can close my eyes & still remember the 1st time i saw you... i can remember being 'together' with you (when i lived in that part of the state) &amp; you were just as nervous then as you are now. i see that hasn't changed. why is that, i wonder? when i was single, it didn't matter to me a whole lot, but your situation was & is different. NOW it DOES matter to me. a lot of things have changed over the years - such as my marital status, but obviously, our physical attraction to one another has not. i still have the same reaction now, as i did then, when you kiss me! back when i was checking your projects &amp; i went to your location - you kissed me   & THAT WAS 100% SPONTANEITY!   you didn't know i was coming up there that day &amp; i didn't know you would be there. when you called me into the garage, i had absolutely no idea as to 'why'. this past week, i didn't know you were coming to where i work & i'm sure you hadn't planned it, either. you just followed your _____? (there are a lot of words i can put here; like "heart"; "mind"; "instinct" - but you & i both know i think you're following your anatomy! ? to put it "delicately". but THAT is spontaneity, too. THAT is how "it" will happen; if/when "it" happens. that's pretty much the long & the short of it. i can not plan it out - due to circumstances beyond my control. there are too many things that could change in my schedule. i have to say this much - i am quite certain once "it" happenes - i'll be in way over my head. it is not something i take lightly. there will be no turning back &amp; there can't be any regrets. you &amp; i both have to be 100% positive this is what we want.

        It was a lifetime ago, or so it seems to me now. I was barely 19 & living far away from home - FL. I had just graduated from basic training &amp; met Mirca, Judy & Theresa. The girls were planning an 'outing' since we were no longer in "boot camp", but still considered in a training status. They all had boyfriends/companions, but me. Mirca's fiancee (Jon) &amp; Judy's boyfriend both suggested they'd set me up with "Teddy" - that's the nickname I gave him soon after we'd met. We were all in the chow hall eating lunch when Jon went to get Teddy. In walked the most gorgeous man I'd ever met in MY ENTIRE LIFE! He had the "all american boy" look about him. Curly blonde hair; the BLUEST eyes I have EVER seen (even 21 years later, I've never met anyone with eyes THAT blue!); tanned & definately an athelete! He was sooooo muscular, you could tell he worked out - &amp; regularly (not just the NAVY fitness program either). Oh, he was tall - 6'1", too. I melted at first sight. I never figured a plain-jane from hicksville would ever stand a chance with a guy like that. Us ladies all took a trip into town to purchase some civilian clothes, for the BIG night out on the town. We didn't want to make it too obvious that we were in the military when we went out (but we didn't want to get caught, either, cuz wearing civilian clothes while in a training status was a 'no-no'). We got back to the barracks & Mirca &amp; Judy primped & fussed to get my makeup just so &amp; we headed out to meet the guys. They were waiting in the game room as we came downstairs with our "civvies" in one duffel bag. We'd gotten a hotel room where we all changed & headed out to the 94th Aero Squadron in Orlando. The place was all set up like an airport &amp; the inside looked like the inside of an airplane - to some extent. There was a huge movie theater inside the bar where you could watch a movie at your table. Superman had just been released & was the movie they played. Teddy &amp; I made small talk since we had only met earlier that day & didn't know each other. We stayed out until the place closed down, &amp; took a taxi back to the hotel to change & back to the base. By this time Teddy &amp; I were holding hands & walking arm-n-arm, like we'd known each other all our lives. The next morning, the guys met us in the galley for a quick breakfast, then off to work we went in our different directions. Since we were all on duty we couldn't leave the base that evening. We decided to meet up again in the game room. The game room of the barracks was a HUGE room that had pool tables, ping-pong, video games, pinball machines &amp; various "board games" like monopoly & such. There was also an area set up as a library &amp; on some evenings, we'd be lucky if there was a 'budding' stand-up comic in the bunch. Our duty night was "lucky" because there was a guy who looked just like "Father Guido Sarducci" from Saturday Night Live & he always had the place in stitches. (Bill Cosby - look out). This guy was HILARIOUS! Well, since it was our duty night, we all hung out in the game room &amp; listened & watched the show. "Father Sarducci" as we called him was performing "mock" weddings this particular night. (Unbeknownst to me, it was all a set-up) He'd walk up to a table &amp; ask the couple sitting there if they'd like to be 'married' & he'd rattle off a wedding ceremony that was so blatently exaggerated &amp; unreal that it was funny. He went from table to table & each "ceremony" became more &amp; more hysterical. The whole place was laughing so hard we were in tears. (I swear this guy missed his calling). He came to our table & asked Mirca &amp; Jon if they wanted to be 'married'. Of course, they said "yes" (they were engaged for real anyway) & Father Sarducci did a 2-second ceremony - but the place went wild. He asked Judy &amp; Tex, then came to me & Teddy. We played along with the humor, but at the last instant, Teddy put his hand up to Father Sarducci &amp; said 'no, wait a second - there's something I have to do first'. Teddy got down on one knee & took my hand in his, reached into his back pocket &amp; pulled out an opal ring (my birthstone) - which he presented to me "Will you marry me?" he asked. I was shocked & flabbergasted &amp; surprised, but I thought it was all part of the act so I laughed as though he couldn't possibly be serious. After all, I had known him barely 24 hours! Teddy was in tears! For real. When I realized he was serious, I said I'd have to think about it - it was too sudden. It was then that I learned the whole "mock wedding ceremonies" were a set-up because Teddy had discussed his intentions with Father Sarducci earlier that day.

         Headed up to NHIS early Fri. morning. Got a later start than I had anticipated, the day was kind of dreary looking & thought it was going to rain. Took a minute to check out    urlLink   www.weather.com      to see what it looked like in Concord. Not too promising there, either. Usually, I head 91N to 9E (less traffic &amp; I can make it in just over 3 1/2 hours!). Decided to try a different route & headed out on the mass. pike - BIG MISTAKE - construction! UGH! So, I finally make it to the track to watch "my boys" The Featherlite Modified Series. If you've never seen 'em - you sure don't know what you're missing. Hands down, The Mod Tour (as us veterans of the series calls em) puts on THE ABSOLUTE BEST SHOW OF THE WEEKEND! My cell phone quit - for the 2nd time in less than 1 week, but fortunately NEXTEL sponsors the "Cup" this year (can't get used to calling it "NEXTEL CUP", then again - I had a REAL hard time calling it "Winston Cup" after referring to the premier NASCAR series as 'Grand National' forever!) Yeah, I've been around the sport a lifetime. So - back to the cell phone. I head over to the NEXTEL customer service booth &amp; the tech. there takes my phone & checks it all out. Just as I figured - it was fried. The guys were nice, they hooked me up w/a new phone &amp; I was on my way. Got into the gate & picked up a pizza &amp; water for lunch & sat down in the bleachers. Watched the Busch Grand National Series' time trials; the Cup time trials (didn't Martin Truex, Jr. have an AWESOME lap?!) & got ready for the "Main Event". Was prepared to cheer 'The Reg' on - since he's not racing a full schedule on the tour this year &amp; whenever he's racing I always want to see him beat TC! Alas - wasn't meant to be. . . the sky opened up & the rain came down! Not to worry - NHIS has jet dryers &amp; all that fancy stuff. We'll race today. Right? WRONG! After about 4 or 5 bouts of drying the track only to have it rain on again, off again, NHIS officials decided to postpone the race till Saturday! BUMMER - I had other commitments to do on Saturday, so I couldn't stay. Went to MAKRIS Lobster & Steak House (by the way - they have THE BEST Seafood around) &amp; had myself a good ol' fashioned clam bake! Complete w/crab cakes, lobster & steamers, etc. I've met the likes of Dale Jarrett, Ned Jarrett, Glen Jarrett, Eli Gold, Brett &amp; Todd Bodine, Rusty Wallace, Joe Bessey, Stub Fadden & Rick Fuller having dinner there. Left there around 10 to make the trip home. Uh Oh! By now it was starting to rain &amp; that made the 4 hr. drive turn into 5. All in a days' work. I usually make the trip alone &amp; this year was no different. Maybe someday I'll have someone hitch along for the ride?

        urlLink    The racing community has lost a real legend! "Tiger" Tom Baldwin from New York lost his life in a crash at Thompson International Speedway, Thompson, CT last night (08/19/04) .    He drove the #7NY on the NASCAR Featherlite Modified Series & had been racing on "The Tour" since its' inception in 1985. His son,  urlLink    Tommy Baldwin, Jr       .    is a crew chief on the #9 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car driven by Kasey Kahne &amp; owned by Ray Evernham. Tommy Jr. purchased a brand-new Troyer-chassis car for his father when he was the crew-chief for Ward Burton @ Bill Davis Racing when they won the Daytona 500 as a Christmas Present. (Pretty cool Christmas present, huh?) My deepest sympathy to the Baldwin Family & friends; the 7NY Race Team; The Featherlite Modified Series "family"; and all of Tom's fans. He will surely be missed! I, too, was a fan of Tom's. The "Modified Tour" will never be the same. God must be watching a race of champions up in Heaven and He DOES have a list of champions to watch! Richie; Corky; CJ; Dale; Davey; Cliff; Adam; Lee; Kenny; Neil; Alan; Ollie; Robbie; J.D.; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Rest in Peace, my friend.

       Today I received some good news: my "e-mail" pal/new friend let me know that his dad will be well enough to come home on Friday! That is such a good thing, that it makes everything else in life seem trivial. Had a melt-down at work, the "split-job" deal finally got to me & I cracked! I think my boss realizes now (at least I hope he does) that I can't do 2 jobs &amp; do them both well & maintain my sanity. My BP has gone off the charts &amp; I was already on meds to bring it down! I don't need his crap. I think how difficult a time Joe is having & my situation just isn't so bad. I wish I could reach out &amp; give this guy a hug because his postings have made me laugh & made me cry. It really has been a long time since I've done that. One of his postings made me long for something that's been missing for quite some time. Joe - if you read this - you KNOW what I'm talking about! Joseph: you have yourself a wonderful day &amp; take care of you, too! I think you are a beautiful person - both inside &amp; out!

       i'd have no luck at all! my chevy blazer AND my hubby's pickup truck BOTH broke down last week! my blazer seems to have some malady that even the "computer" can't pin down - it's hard to start & if it's cold - just doesn't want to stay running. the AIR BAG light comes on &amp; if it flickers or blinks - the truck will shut off or the engine will stutter as if it were going to stall completely. once it warms up, however - it will run just fine. i had the front brakes done (again) for the 3rd time in 3 years & my hubby says it's the way i drive -- but, i've been complaining about spongy brakes for 3 years; well - finally, the master cylinder completely went & i think that may have been the culprit all along. so; we JUST get the front brakes replaced 2 weeks ago, i went to leave our garage & i stepped on the brake pedal "I'VE GOT NO BRAKES!" i baby it BACK to the repair garage to have our mechanic check it out; just as we figured, the master cylinder let go. well - we had him replace the master cylinder. that brings us up to last week. i took the blazer to work one morning (about 20 miles away from home); pulled in the parking lot & smelled anti-freeze BIG TIME! i came back outside about 1 hour later to head to my temporary work location (with a company vehicle) &amp; saw a HUGE puddle of anti-freeze underneath my truck! uh oh! i checked the anti-freeze & it was VERY low. when i got back to my office, i filled the overflow container with water &amp; headed to our repair garage. that's when we discovered the water pump let go. no biggie - i've still got hubby's pickup truck to take to work in the morning... right? WRONG! got about 1/4 mile away from our home & THE PICKUP DECIDES TO QUIT! the alternator wasn't charging fully, which caused the pickup to shut off. called AAA to have the truck towed to OUR garage. thank God my husband is a good diesel mechanic &amp; all. we get the alternator replaced, but it's STILL not fully charging, we found out that the batteries were pretty much shot & they have to be replaced, too. next, we drive out to beantown to deliver parts to an old friend of my hubby's &amp; hear "growling" coming from the rear brakes on the pickup. spent all day today taking the back wheels off the pickup - only to discover the rear brake shoes were worn out on one side & broken on the other. the brake drums were rusted onto the hubs, they probably have never been apart! it's like we just get one thing fixed &amp; something else goes wrong.

                     I am worried -- I've  made a new "friend" -- sort-of, more like a "pen-pal" but only via the internet.  He's going through a really tough time right now &amp; needs our prayers.&nbsp;  I haven't heard from him in a couple of days &amp; usually he is extremely witty  &amp; jovial. I am praying everything is ok, but please pray for my 'internet'  pal Joseph. Thank you.          &nbsp;

       Went to the Hudson (MA) antique truck show this weekend. Ended up in beantown afterwards. WOW! Since the "big dig" is like 99% complete - Boston sure looks different than it did just about the same time last year. Had the BEST cannolli's IN THE WORLD at 'Bova's Bakery' & some awesome seafood chowder at 'The No-Name' seafood restaurant. I think their menu is rather limited, but the chowder is worth it! Took a tour &amp; saw "Cheers" - the 'Bull & Finch Pub' from the tv show 'Cheers'. They only used the outside for the tv show, but have re-created what the tv set looked like in Quincy Market. Paul Revere's house &amp; the Old North Church appear to be under restoration - been in them both &amp; you can feel the history!

        yesterday was really, really cool. i got to meet some of the BEST stock car drivers anywhere on the east coast! There were 14 of the best of the best - guys who have not raced in quite a few years, but their racing careers are legendary & some of them have records that were set so long ago &amp; not broken still! guys like "Da Champ" Rene Charland; "Bugsy" Stevens; Don LaJoie (yes, Randy's dad); Gene Bergin; Ron Narducci; "Wild" Bill Greco; "Wild" Bill Slater; Leo "the Lion" Cleary; Pete Hamilton (he won the Daytona 500 in 1970!); Denny Zimmerman (Indy 500 R.O.T.Y.); Don Rounds; Eddie West; Ronnie Bouchard (he won the Talledega 500 in 1981, his rookie year in the Winston Cup series) & a few more. these guys are, hands down - the best at what they did on the race track. They've all won MULTIPLE championships &amp; won races all along the east coast from Maine to Florida! Wherever they happened to show up with a racecar in tow - you knew their chances of taking home the prize $ were really, really high - home track or not! they ran on asphalt or dirt, it didn't matter - they'd most likely take home the $ as well as the checkered flag.
