      Still a mostly wasted day.  I didn't feel up to writing, but I did at least get some necessary research and editing done.  I'll resume living tomorrow.  Boring, out.

      I hate this - suffer all week long until I reach glorious Saturday, only to find I'm not feeling well enough to do anything other than take up space.  Instead of a day of accomplishments, today's sole purpose will be to connect yesterday to tomorrow.  I'll try to write later (promise).  Puke, out.

      If you wonder why  urlLink Arnold Schwarzenegger  will never will be president, it's not because he is an immigrant.  It's because his name does not mesh with the name song:  Schwarzenegger, Schwarzenegger, bo Barzenegger Banana Fana fo Farzenegger  Otherwise, I like the guy.  But let's throw our support to  urlLink someone  electable.  Barry, Barry, bo Barry Banana Fana fo Farry  Political, out

      This set contains the first three books by R. A. Salvatore. Although not his best work, they do make an interesting fantasy read. So far I've only finished the first two.  Book 1 - The Crystal Shard: not poorly written, but the editorial mistakes and writing style lend an amateurish air to the book. Also, the first story almost seems to exist solely to setup the other two. I half expected a note at the end saying "I told you that story so I could tell you the next one."  Book 2 - Streams of Silver: much better. No editorial mistakes and the writing is stronger, although it does end abruptly.  Book 3 - The Halfling's Gem: I've just started that one, which takes place immediately after the second book, in the middle of a pursuit no less.  It reads more like a single novel rather than a series of related tales. I think it was broken into three parts in accordance with federal law which states all fantasy and sci-fi stories must be presented in the form of a trilogy.

      What is up with the people of my generation (you know who you are)? I've been cruising the google blogs for a few weeks now, and most of the ones I've found from people near my age consist of grocery and to-do lists, complaints about their miserable jobs, and lamentations of lost love (there's my daily alliteration). Not that I'm trying to trivialize anyone's pain, but I have all the "I need bread, my job sucks, and nobody loves me" I need. Where's the passion, people? The dreams? The psychotic ramblings? You're telling me I can't find nut-jobs on the  Internet ? What has this world come to? I remember when I was your age and everything cost a nickel and I had to walk to and from school, uphill, both ways, through three feet of snow under the blazing July sun...  Ah, who am I to resist. My to-do list:   Buy bread.  Find true love, or a cheap tart, or something in-between.  Write at least 500 words tonight.  Halle Berry.   Thoreau once asserted that most people lost more than they gained as they aged. Let's not let the smug bastard be right.

      For a very short while, people at work started adding personal quotes to the end of their e-mails. This was a rare glimpse into the minds of those around me who normally drift around like ghosts, appearing to be no more than mere images of real people. Of course, management quickly caught on and put an end to it ("OMG! They're expressing opinions! On company property!"), but before that happened I started a little collection. Here's my tagline collection with a few thoughts:    Whether we bring our enemies to justice or justice to our enemies, justice will be done.... Not that I disagree with the sentiment, but does it really mesh with the (lack of) office culture? "Hey, Bob. Here are those TPS reports you asked for. Death to the godless heathens, out."   "An organization's ability to learn and translate that learning into action rapidly is the ultimate competitive business advantage." - Jack Welch, Chairman, General Electric Now say that five times real fast.   Never give up your dreams...they will always give you a goal to accomplish. I'm cool with this one. Of course, one of my dreams is to find a better job. No wonder the MiCs (Morons in Charge) wanted this notion suppressed.   Be a sport and take a kid fishing this summer! Okay.  Does it have to be my kid, or can I just grab one at random?   ** Please use the Reply function to send your correspondence ** An e-mail telling you how to use the e-mail.   Briefly look over your life, "For what purpose do you live?" Okay, you've convinced me.  I'm offing myself.   Find a purpose in life so big it will challenge every capacity to be at your best. Do I get any rest breaks?  Ever?   *Backup requests are made to comply with audit requirements* Can't get much more corporate than that.   "Whatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon, must inevitably come to pass" - Paul J. Meyer I like the fact that Herr Meyer included the fact that you have to WORK to make your dreams come true.  A lot of human quote generators tend to forget that part.   "I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he/she has overcome while trying to succeed." - Booker T. Washington I like that sentiment - it makes me feel more successful than my banks statements allow.   Have a Nice Day! Fuck you.  Don't tell me what kind of day to have.   "To Be, or Not To Be"....is not a question.--UNKNOWN 'nuff said.   "I HEAR and I forget. I SEE and I remember. I DO and I understand." I FART and the room clears.   "Forgiveness is the fragrance that the flower leaves on the heel of the one that crushed it." I think this one came from someone experiencing an unhappy breakup.   A cheerful heart is good medicine... (Prov 17:22a) Religionists!  Aaaack!  Run!   "God created man, because he was disappointed in the monkey" Mark Twain I've heard this is a misquote, but I'm not sure.   "Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones surround us every day." - Sally Koch I agree with Sally, whoever she is.   " Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens " .......Jimi Hendrix Jimi rox!   -- Spend every moment like it's your last -- AAAAAAGH!  I'M GONNA FREAKIN' DIE RIGHT NOW!  NO, NOW!  NO...   Today's mighty oak is just yesterday's nut that held its ground. I can relate.   Music is to the soul and bread is to the body; Except the body can dump the crap Hunh?   "The problems we have today cannot be solved with the same level of thinking we were at when we caused them." Albert Einstein Yeah.  You go, Al.   If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague. Or, preferably, on fire.   A penny saved is a government oversight. I read long ago that the government spends over $200 million a year minting those stupid, useless things.  Time for them to go.  Lets get rid of the pennies while we're at it.   Attitude - The difference between an ordeal and an adventure I should have remembered that yesterday.  Of course, that's probably as useless as telling someone to "Cheer up."  Has that ever worked?   "What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness?" Jean-Jacques Rousseau  urlLink Jimmy Stewart  said something similar in  urlLink Harvey .  "In this world, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.  Well, for years I was smart.  I recommend pleasant.  And you may quote me."   "Of all the days you have available to choose from, today will give you the earliest start and the best advantage." Ehh.  I'll comment tomorrow.  Actually, I kind of like this one.   Be careful about reading health books.  You may die of a misprint. (Mark Twain) I don't know if that was really his or not.  Mark Twain, like Abraham Lincoln, has the distinction of being one of the most misquoted individuals in history.   "Someday, in the distant future, our grandchildren's grandchildren will develop a new equivalent of our classrooms.  They will spend many hours in front of boxes with fires glowing within.  May they have the wisdom to know the difference between light and knowledge" - Plato - I don't think our grandchildren are old enough to be having sex.  And my personal favorite (taken from  urlLink Stephen King 's  urlLink Wizard and Glass ) - Good is bad, bad is good, all the stuff's the same.  Evil, out.

      I admit it.&nbsp; I'm wimping out tonight.&nbsp; I'm running late and my brain is stuck in neutral, so I'm taking the night off from writing.&nbsp; I'll try to trade my Friday night off for my Thursday night of production (anyone who's been reading knows that probably won't work).   I don't know how the pioneers did it.&nbsp; If I go to work, the gym, and the post office all in the same day, I need a nap.&nbsp; Something has been lost over the generations.&nbsp; If it keeps up, our children will probably beat this obesity craze because they'll be too lazy to chew.

      People who walk around with their mouths open look  really  stupid.&nbsp; So cut it out.  Unless, of course, you actually are a moron and wish to warn the rest of us.&nbsp; In that case, thank you and keep up the good work.  I've often thought some people should be sentenced to wear scarlet letters on their shirts.&nbsp; Not for such trivial and outdated crimes as adultery, but for more modern offenses, inconveniences against their fellow man (and woman).&nbsp; For example, some should be branded with an M for Moron, or BD for Bad Driver.&nbsp; Of course, I could be wrong.&nbsp; Wait, no I couldn't - I'm wearing my scarlet letter G (Godlike).

       urlLink Run, Lola, Run  - this has become a favorite of mine.&nbsp; After watching it intently the first time, it's a good one to put in when I'm distracted and can only give the TV my partial attention.&nbsp; This kinetic movie is best watched with the original German soundtrack with subtitles.&nbsp; The English dubbing is over-emoted.  &nbsp;- 4 out of 5 stars    urlLink Better Off Dead  - cute, funny, and lightly dark&nbsp;teen romantic comedy,&nbsp;sometimes venturing into the realm of fantasy. - 3 out of 5 stars   urlLink Mad Max  - classic sci-fi film, better than it was intended to be.&nbsp; The DVD version has the original track, complete with the Australian actors' original voices, toned-down music, and understated background effects.&nbsp; Rated R for mostly suggested blood and gore, it would probably garner a PG-13 rating today. &nbsp;- 3.5 out of 5 stars   urlLink The Road Warrior  - more action and less story with this freak-laden sequel, more fun than a realistic view of the future.&nbsp; The real star of the movies, the black V8 Interceptor, met its demise here so I don't know why they bothered with number  urlLink III  or why they're making number  urlLink IV . &nbsp;- 3 out of 5 stars

      For yesterday's wuss note complaining about my inability to rant or work myself into an emotional frenzy.&nbsp; So, without further ado...  KILL (your arch-nemesis here)!&nbsp; KILL 'EM TO DEATH!&nbsp; KILL 'EM A LOT!&nbsp; KILL 'EM A BUNCH OF TIMES!  On a related topic, I've decided that our society needs better accountability on a personal level.&nbsp; Not jail or some other unreliable future punishment, but real-time consequences.&nbsp; Too much&nbsp;assholery occurs because jerks don't fear retribution.&nbsp; This is why I firmly believe in violence.&nbsp; It's not just for entertainment, people.&nbsp; Useful results can be obtained.  I thought about starting a club and asking members to wear buttons with slogans like "Decrease the Peace," "Kiss Me, I'm Psychotic," or "I Kill People Like You," but buttons are hard to see at a distance and those little stickers are&nbsp;mostly only dangerous to the wearer. &nbsp;Instead, I think everyone should carry a flame-thrower with them at all times.&nbsp; We could be called the Flame-thrower Brigade (or FB's, pronounced "Feebs").&nbsp; They're easier for people&nbsp;to see, useful for solving almost every problem, and the added weight will improve our cardio conditioning.&nbsp; Perhaps you think this sounds a bit harsh, but consider the following scenarios:  Theater Owner:&nbsp; Can I, after charging you nearly $20 for a ticket and popcorn, make you sit through several minutes of commercials too long to be played on TV? FB:&nbsp; Of course, if I can set fire to your theater on the way out.  Person in Parking Lot:&nbsp; Can I place this flyer, advocating my political views/telephone billing plan/pizza parlor, under your windshield wiper? FB:&nbsp; Sure, if I can set your flyer ablaze and shove it up your nose.  Religionist: Ding dong! Why don't I tell you about my religion? FB: Why don't you BURN IN HELL?!! (fwoosh)  So, you can see, all of life's little troubles can be solved with the judicious application of fire. So let's be good to each other, people.&nbsp; Or else&nbsp;some FB will roast you like an espresso bean.  Good is bad, bad is good, all the stuff's the same. I'm back, baby.

      ...why all the liquor stores are required to use the term "Package Store" or "Bottle Shop."&nbsp; They're not fooling anybody.&nbsp; Whoever made the law apparently believed that evil is okay when it's not out in the open.   I remember going to one bottle shop called Fatzos.&nbsp; My mother was visiting and she sent me in to buy lottery tickets for her.&nbsp; She is a devout christian (read:&nbsp; hypocrite) who doesn't think it's sinning if you get someone else to do it for you.&nbsp; Anyway, this place should have called itself the House of Sin.&nbsp; They sold lottery tickets, tobacco products, booze, girlie magazines, sodas, and a few unhealthy snacks.&nbsp; I bought her lottery tickets and a&nbsp;Mountain Dew, for which I will spend eternity in the  urlLink 7th level of Hell .

       urlLink Warlock .&nbsp; This is a decent B-grade horror movie with really cheesy special effects.&nbsp; 2.5 out of 5 stars.   urlLink Warlock:&nbsp; The Armageddon .&nbsp; Good - the song playing while the closing credits rolled.&nbsp; Bad - everything leading up to that point.&nbsp; It had nothing to do with the original film.&nbsp; 0.5 out of 5 stars.   urlLink Warlock III:&nbsp; The End of Innocence .&nbsp; This direct to video dog had nothing to do with the prior two movies, but was a slight improvement.&nbsp; Hopefully they'll quit making these movies.&nbsp; I'm through watching them.&nbsp; 1 out of 5 stars.

      Update on the music - I no longer hear the end of "Ain't We Got Fun" repeating in my head when I awaken.&nbsp; Now I hear the musical number from  urlLink John Carpenter 's  urlLink Escape From New York .&nbsp; It's from the scene where Snake enters a dilapidated theatre and finds a bunch of convicts (all men) in drag singing an Ethel Mermon song (I think) in off-key baritone voices.&nbsp; It's an improvement.  This morning I woke up and began the day as always - wishing I didn't have to get up, then getting up and packing my lunch pail.&nbsp; For some reason I noticed I had loaded the refrigerator with cans of Dr. Pepper the night before instead of my usual mix.&nbsp; I wondered why I did that, then I woke up.&nbsp; I realized I had been dreaming about starting the day, so then I actually did start the day.&nbsp; When I got to the refrigerator I saw that I had actually put several cans of&nbsp;Pepsi inside to cool.&nbsp; Then I woke up.&nbsp; The next time around I found that I had loaded the refrigerator with a mixture, although they were all Coke products.&nbsp; Then I woke up.&nbsp; What's really bizarre about all this is that my favorite is  urlLink Mountain Dew .   urlLink Stephen King  was right when he said "Hell is repetition."

      After seeing this movie, I was filled with the same feeling I get when I watch any great film, a feeling&nbsp;which can be best described as "gottapeegottapeegottapee."&nbsp; I need to stop buying the large soda.   I won't say much about the movie itself for fear of giving anything away, but it was an improvement over the original in much the same way as  urlLink X2  was better than the first  urlLink X-Men .&nbsp; It had a better story and a more complex villain(s), although they were a bit looser with the details of Spider-Man's powers.&nbsp; It reminds me of something I've read about writing fantasy - you create the details of your world, but you still need to remain true to them.   One other comment - I had heard rumors about who was to be playing the lead role.&nbsp; When  urlLink Tobey Maguire &nbsp;looked like he would have been unavailable,  urlLink Jake Gyllenhaal , then boyfriend of  urlLink Kirsten Dunst , was contacted and began to prep for the role.&nbsp; Maguire eventually signed on at the last minute and replaced him.&nbsp; It may have been my imagination, but in some scenes it seemed like a little vitriol slipped through Dunst's dulcet performance.&nbsp; For example, in the cafe scene her lips said "Kiss me" but her eyes said "Kill yourself."  &nbsp;- 4 out of 5 stars

      Another masterpiece from  urlLink Joe R. Lansdale , master of East Texas humor and grit. This book also features heavy doses of nostalgia (set in and around a drive-in theatre in 1958) and mystery. Warning - not for mystery lovers who like a story that neatly solves itself in the end. Lansdale tends to lean toward reality, where every problem does not have an accessible solution.  - 4.5 out of 5 stars

      This is more like it:  &nbsp;  The wretched King Minos has decided your fate. His tail wraps around his body 7 times.  The sweet light no longer strikes against your eyes. Your shade has been banished to...   The Seventh Level of Hell!   Guarded by the Minotaur, who snarls in fury, and encircled within the river Phlegethon, filled with boiling blood, is the Seventh Level of Hell. The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment. The stench here is overpowering. This level is also home to the wood of the suicides- stunted and gnarled trees with twisting branches and poisoned fruit. At the time of final judgement, their bodies will hang from their branches. In those branches the Harpies, foul birdlike creatures with human faces, make their nests. Beyond the wood is scorching sand where those who committed violence against God and nature are showered with flakes of fire that rain down against their naked bodies. Blasphemers and sodomites writhe in pain, their tongues more loosed to lamentation, and out of their eyes gushes forth their woe. Usurers, who followed neither nature nor art, also share company in the Seventh Level.    The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to  the Seventh Level of Hell!    Here is how you matched up against all the levels:        Level    Score       Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very Low       Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Low       Level 2   (Lustful)   High       Level 3   (Gluttonous)   High       Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Low       Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Very High       Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very High       Level 7   (Violent)   Extreme       Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Very High       Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Moderate        Take the  urlLink Dante's Inferno Test

      For awhile I kept waking up with a snatch of song repeating in my head.&nbsp; It was never a whole song, or even a complete refrain, just a few words playing over and over and over again.&nbsp; It started with that song "Ain't We Got Fun."&nbsp; I don't know if that is the actual title, but it was the repeating part.&nbsp; That, and the strumming on the ukulele as the song ends.&nbsp; Each day it got worse.&nbsp; The "Ain't we got fun" bit got quieter and the ukulele got louder until it boomed like  urlLink Nigel Tufnel  had it turned up to eleven.  &nbsp;  When I began to wonder if my medical plan covered lobotomies (forgetting that I don't actually have a medical plan), it shifted to what was once called negro spirituals.&nbsp; Fortunately I'm not a hummer or a singer.&nbsp; That'd be just what I'd needed, to be caught wandering the ethnically diverse cube farm in which I work singing about how I'm gonna jump back, turn around, and pick a bale of cotton.&nbsp; Otherwise, it was a marked improvement.  &nbsp;  Then the tune switched to "Hey, Jude."&nbsp; Just that - "Hey, Jude" followed by a few piano notes.&nbsp; I said to myself "Now, this I can handle."&nbsp; I must have said it out loud because it only happened one morning, then the&nbsp;man who lives in my medicine cabinet&nbsp;switched the channels back to "Ain't We Got Fun."&nbsp; Normally he's cool, but lately I think he's been nipping on my after shave.  &nbsp;  Anyway, that's the latest from my brain.&nbsp; If anyone knows a good back alley lobotomist, please leave a comment.

      What happened with the cereals?&nbsp; I just bought some sugary, chemical laden breakfast cereals, the likes of which I haven't eaten since I was a&nbsp;child - Cocoa Puffs and Apple Jacks, to be exact - and found the&nbsp;cheesy useless prizes inside were sitting on top.&nbsp; What's with that?&nbsp; In my day the prizes were on the bottom, inside the bag with the food.&nbsp; I would stick my grubby arms into the box at the breakfast table, digging through mounds of sweetened crap, groping for the prize.&nbsp; My parents would yell at me, telling me I had to eat my way down to the prize, then would yell at me again for eating too much cereal.&nbsp; Note to parents - pick one already.  &nbsp;  Ah, memories.&nbsp; Kids these days don't know what they're missing.

      This is a sci-fi flick starring  urlLink Tom Selleck  and  urlLink Gene Simmons .&nbsp; It's not as bad or as good as you might think.&nbsp; After a promising and interesting start, the movie falls into repetition.&nbsp; The formula goes:  Main Character (I forgot his name already):&nbsp; I must catch the evil Dr. Luther.  Main Character and police find the evil Dr. Luther and associates.&nbsp; Violence ensues.&nbsp; Secondary characters from both sides die.  Police Captain:&nbsp; Main Character!&nbsp; You allowed the evil Dr. Luther to escape!&nbsp; You suck!&nbsp; But, even though you're outside of your jurisdiction, I will begrudgingly allow you to continue!  Repeat for nearly two hours.&nbsp; Make it seem even longer.   Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; This is not a completely rotten movie, it just would have worked better as an hour long episode of something.&nbsp; Something interesting I noted - it was given a PG-13 rating despite a little gratuitous nudity and the use of the fucking F-word.&nbsp; The&nbsp;film was released in 1984, which I believe was the first year that rating saw use.&nbsp; I guess the picture people hadn't hammered out the boundaries.  &nbsp;- 2.5 out of 5 stars.

      My job is to occupy space in a cubicle, producing about ten hours of actual work spread out over the course of a month due to waiting for morons to make decisions.   For instance, in my role as fact-checker I may come across a note such as: "Let’s schedule a training class in Dallas, TX. The teacher wants to be able to see the Empire State Building from the classroom." To which I compose an e-mail similar to: "I’m sorry, but the Empire State Building is not visible from Dallas. Something is blocking the view, possibly the Swiss Alps or Jupiter. Would you like the class to be moved to New York, or should it stay in Dallas." And then I wait.   About a week later I get my answer: "Yes." I forgot that if I illicit a response greater than binary, I just cause confusion amongst the higher powers.   Anyway, I then break the question into a series requiring yes or no answers.  Me: Do you want the class to be held in Dallas?  Moron (next week): No.  Me: Do you want the class to be held in New York?  Moron (next week): Yes.   Finally, I am ready to proceed. I now have to get permission to move the class from the current Moron In Charge since the last MIC listed the Dallas project as taking place in France and therefore the system locks out interference from the US.  Me: Can I move this class from Dallas, TX, France to New York, NY, US?  MIC (next week): Let me find another manager to approve this.   Forgetting that he or she is the sole authority over classes held in New York, the MIC institutes a game of manager tag. E-mails (cc: me) bounce around the world asking someone else to step up to the plate and approve. Eventually the messages fly high enough and someone authorizes the authorizing manager to go ahead and give their authorization. Then the e-mail flow reverses and each previously consulted moron tells the one before that he or she has decided whatever the manager who actually made the decision decided.  Did I mention these leaders are paid more than twice what I am paid? And have full medical and retirement benefits? No? Well, it’s probably irrelevant.  Anyway, with all the approvals completed I finally go to change the class location in the system only to find the class was canceled weeks ago due to a complete lack of interest.  In one hour I can leave, enjoy my weekend of R&amp;R, then come back and do it again. Wheee!  Not that I’m complaining.

      Basically none. I meant to write last night, but I was stopped by...aliens. Yeah. That’s it. That’s the ticket. Aliens beamed into my work area and blocked my access to the keyboard. We fought for hours. Have you ever seen  urlLink Enter the Dragon ? It was just like that (I was Bruce Lee). In the end I summoned my life force and exiled them to the 37th dimension (one of the bad ones). But the damage was done. I had to enter my regeneration tank, complete with large screen TV and beer refrigerator, and was thus unable to spend any time writing. Tonight I’ll get some work done, although I don’t usually have much imagination on a Friday.

      ...may be trying to tell me something. Over the past three years, while learning to cope with my rotten and boring McJob, I have developed a schedule that allows me to spend as little time in the office as possible and more time sleeping, eating, reading, running errands, and watching movies.  I call it telecommuting - I accomplish just as much while spending less time trapped in a cubicle with nothing better to do than update my blog. Anyway, after three years of slipping in and out unnoticed, I encountered one of my five bosses twice in one week while coming in late to work.  The first time was in the parking deck where she latched onto my car like I was towing her and rode my tail until I made the unorthodox move of cutting across an empty section.  She, of course, slowed and refused to deviate from the designated lanes.  She may not have noticed me as I followed her at a distance into the building.  That was Monday. Wednesday, having not learned my lesson, I drove to work even later and detoured by the post office to return some DVDs to  urlLink NetFlix .  I get stuck behind some complete moron who won't turn into the parking lot until all traffic is clear within the Eastern time zone.  The idiot finally turns, then stops just inside the lot and debates where to go next.  Meanwhile, I had made my turn but now found myself with the ass-end of my car blocking traffic.  After a few more tentative starts, we finally near the post office and the other car eventually selects the parking spot I wanted.  Don't ask me why I didn't recognized her car from Monday.  I guess it's because those silver Honda Accords are so nondescript.  Any, the boss lady gets out and heads inside the post office with her mail.  I waited a few seconds, then dropped my stuff in the box in the vestibule and slipped out.  Again, I have no idea if she saw me.  Any normal human would have noticed, but she's basically oblivious. I should point out that, in both cases, I didn't realize it was her until she stepped out of her car.  I'm glad I'm not the type to scream at offensive drivers.  It doesn't matter that she was just as late as me in both cases.  She's considered to be low-level management, which means she actually is allowed to telecommute. In retrospect, these incidents are a perfect metaphor for her leadership ability - an enthusiastic follower unless entering into uncharted territory, wherein she prefers to slow down, back off, and follow whatever guidelines she can find, no matter how pointless.  When forced to make a decision, she takes as long as she can to enact the safest decision for her.  The sad part is that she is not my most indecisive boss.

      Quick synopsis - I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm AAAAAAAAA WE'RE UNDER ATTACK...okay, I'm bored again.  I could also use a shower. Actually, this is a great movie.  If possible watch the director's cut (about 3 1/2 hours).  Over an hour was cut for the initial U.S. release, but the additional footage serves to heighten the anxiety and terror.  - 4.5 out of 5 stars.  BTW, Boot is pronounced Boat (which is also what it means in English).

      This is a classic sci-fi/action/western tale from Michael Crichton.  Since he both wrote (as a screenplay) and directed it, the story doesn't take the beating they normally do making the transition from book to film.  Plus, being released 31 years ago, it's fun to see a vision of the future run by computers that are banks of flashing lights and reel-to-reel magnetic tape.  Still, Crichton's future seems more possible with each passing year, especially in its depiction of computer malfunctions due to viruses.   - 4 out of 5 stars

       urlLink Burning books  in the news (be sure to note the name of the preacher and the church).  As a writer, I wholeheartedly support churches burning books.  One of two situations must apply - either the church ordered its parishioners to steal the books, in which case I can savor the irony, or they used their tithings to buy the freaking things, thus supporting the industry they attack.  Book burning is a good metaphor for religion - flame and noise and hatred and finger-pointing with no real impact on their appointed enemies.  Besides, they need their enemies.  Without them they'll have to point those fingers at themselves.  I think I'll dedicate my first novel to Satan in the hopes that many religions will want to burn it.  If any religious representatives want to place an early order,  urlLink e-mail  me and let me know.  I'll see that your church gets a good discount based on volume.

      This is a darkly humorous tale of Scottish heroin addicts.  You may need the subtitles on for this one.  The beginning is funny, although a bit scattered.  A plot eventually develops around one trying to leave the scag life, succeeding for awhile, then getting sucked back in.  Overall very interesting and blackly funny with tragic overtones.  - 3.5 out of 5 stars.

      As a child, I frequently dreamt that all the people in the world were oppressed by a sleeping bulldog the size of a pony.  We would lie on rubber mats as if asleep, never moving, and make no sounds other than gentle breathing.  The slightest rustle would carry through long, plastic tubes (similar to flexible drinking straws) and awaken the beast.  The dog would rush from its mat where it slept at the center of the tube collective and devour the offender within seconds (it was very fast).  I knew that if we all rose up and attacked together we could defeat it, but an individual would be doomed.  I spent long hours hoping someone would signal the attack, then many more trying to find the courage to start the rebellion myself.  Neither ever happened.  In my teens, the dream reappeared with a twist ending.  I finally opened my eyes to discover there was no mat nor tube nor dog.  I was actually in a sensory deprivation tank, my reality fed to me by computer, and I was the experimental subject of scientists in white lab coats.  Of course, now that I'm all grown up, I realize the ultimate fear is fear itself.  That, and the hordes of giant atomic chickens that will, in accordance with prophecy, eventually overrun the planet.   Oh, yeah?  Just you wait.  Update on the  urlLink NetFlix  test:  all three DVDs were returned within one day, although the two mailed directly from the post office arrived hours before the one mailed from the mail box.  Keep in mind that both are within 20 feet of each other and they have the same pickup times posted.

      Last night was movie and Chinese food night.&nbsp I don't know if the Kung Pao appeased the literary gods or not - so far, no more writing news to post.&nbsp For the movies, not a bad choice in the bunch.   urlLink Rashomon :&nbsp another great story by  urlLink Akira Kurosawa .&nbsp An interesting murder mystery, one which changes with each character's retelling.&nbsp Fortunately, forensic medicine has improved since the time of feudal Japan, and so have eyebrow fashions (women's eyebrows looked like smudges or bruises on their foreheads).  - 4 out of 5 stars.   urlLink The Hidden :&nbsp For my money, the best action/horror/sci-fi/buddy cop/humor movie of 1987.&nbsp Seriously, a good sci-fi action flick.&nbsp It has the usual minor discrepancies in continuity and logic, but those are offset by a believable story, great action, and a villain I couldn't help but envy.&nbsp WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD.&nbsp The ending was slightly ambiguous, but not in a bad way.&nbsp It made me wonder if one character took the place of the other, or actually sacrificed himself so the other could live.  - 4 out of 5 stars.   urlLink Futurama , season 3, disc 1:&nbsp still funny, but the humor wasn't up to snuff for this installment.&nbsp The show is getting a little predictable and maudlin, trying to pull heart strings where it used to go for a sucker punch.&nbsp Also they've taken their homages into theft territory.&nbsp Still good, but far from the best this series has to offer.  - 3.5 out of 5 stars.  In a somewhat related matter, the last time I returned movies to  urlLink NetFlix  they arrived a day later than normal.&nbsp Mailing them from home always took two days, but now the local post office takes just as long.&nbsp They recently posted a sign saying all mail will be sent to downtown Atlanta to be sorted.&nbsp As a test, I mailed two DVDs from the post office, and another one from a nearby mail box.&nbsp Hopefully one of them will knock that extra day off my turnaround time.

      Today I found that my $6 check from  urlLink Hadrosaur Tales  bounced.&nbsp My entire literary fortune has been wiped out!&nbsp I checked their web site to see if they had folded (this is very common in the fiction marketplace), but they appear to be alive and kicking.&nbsp Only one course of action left to me.&nbsp The  urlLink Literary Gods  must be appeased!&nbsp Time to sacrifice something.&nbsp If I have the Kung Pao Chicken for dinner, will that count?  Only one way to know.

      Number of words written on Blank Slate - 900. Short of my goal of 1,000 per non-work day, but still an improvement.  I checked my second published story, and it's still available in the  urlLink November 2001  archive of  urlLink Dark Moon Rising .

      Number of words written on Blank Slate - 600. Not an improvement - must do better tomorrow.  A quick check on  urlLink Eclipse Magazine  revealed that my first published story "Locus of Control" is still listed, although no links go to the story itself.&nbsp Eclipse never really took off - only one other story is listed as being published there, and both are from 2001.&nbsp Good is bad, bad is good, all the stuff's the same.

      This is the eighth in the  urlLink Spehanie Plum  novels.&nbsp If you're not familiar with this character, the books contain enough background information so you can start with any one in the series.&nbsp Stephanie is a believably tough bounty hunter, more lucky than good, who usually manages to catch her man while dealing with a lot of angst about the men in her life and her slightly crazy but familiar family.&nbsp Evanovich's writing is incredibly fast-paced, filled with snappy dialog and funny, kinetic storylines.&nbsp Her books could use a little more description - the fast pace would probably survive a little added flesh.  - 4 out of 5 stars

      I had a dream filled with car chases, intrigue, government agents, cops, guns, and explosions.&nbsp It was one of those where my point of view shifted between characters.&nbsp The ultimate goal was to get some code book from some guy which would allow us to go on to whatever we werer trying to accomplish.&nbsp Just as we cornered the code book guy in a building, my POV switched to him (now me) blowing myself up with a grenade.&nbsp Before the explosion, someone (I think my former POV person) rushed forward and knocked the code book to safety.&nbsp My dreams are now ending in cliffhangers.&nbsp Did I really die?&nbsp Both of me?&nbsp Is the code book safe?&nbsp What were we going after anyway?&nbsp These questions and more will be answered as soon as I get back to sleep and pick up the dream where I left off.&nbsp Yeah, right, like that ever happens.&nbsp Ironically, the dream scared me awake.

      Everybody knows the story of Count Dracula, even if they never read Bram Stoker's  urlLink novel .  It has spawned an entire sub-genre, and everybody has at least seen one of the frequent  urlLink remakes , spin-offs from  urlLink Buffy  to  urlLink Buffy  to  urlLink Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter  (I swear I'm not making that up), or at least Count Chocula cereal.  As such, the original movie made from the play made from the novel held no surprises for me, but was enjoyable nonetheless.  Other than the haunting strains of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake during the opening credits, there is no background music which tends to add to the creepy overtones.  A musical score was later added, but I think it shifts the mood from serious to campy, so I would recommend the original version if available.  Bela Lugosi acted the part well - at times being superficially charming, and others like a ravenous beast - but he never over-emoted.  - 3 out of 5 stars

      Overall, a great book.  Descriptions are slim, but not lacking; even though this is the 11th novel in the Burke series, enough detail is present to flesh out the characters without bogging down the action.  Vachss's  urlLink Burke  character is an outlaw private-eye who knows the crime-ridden streets from the wrong side of the law.  This was an interesting point of view, and should appeal to readers of  urlLink Cornwell ,  urlLink Leonard , and  urlLink Parker .  My main complaint... was that... all...  ALL ... the characters... constantly... lapsed... into... broken... conversations... with their... words... broken... by... elipses... which... as you... know... are... three... periods... like... this... ...... see?  - 3.5 out of 5 stars

      Because the  urlLink Sublime Flamingo  has posted many cool  urlLink things  in her online existence, I'm presenting yet another quiz thingy taken from her site.  Choose a band/or artist and answer only in song TITLES by that band:  urlLink Slayer     Are you female or male: The Antichrist (or Angel of Death)  Describe yourself: Captor of Sin (or Born of Fire)  How do some people feel about you: Criminally Insane (or Death's Head)  How do you feel about yourself: Cast Down (or Here Comes the Pain)  Describe your ex girlfriend/boyfriend: Human Disease (or Dead Skin Mask)  Describe your current girlfriend/boyfriend: Desire (or Temptation)  Describe where you want to be: Killing Fields (or South of Heaven)  Describe what you want to be: Live Undead (or Tormentor)  Describe how you live: Sex, Murder, Art (or Payback)  Describe how you love: Perversions of Pain (or Necrophiliac)  Share a few words of wisdom: Read Between the Lies (or Show No Mercy or God Hates Us All or Evil Has No Boundaries or Fight 'til Death or Kill Again or Spill the Blood or...)   I only now realized what a great emotional range Slayer offers - hate, rage, anger, discombobulation, evisceration, hate.  The world is truly blessed to have such artists walk among us.

      Has anyone thought about the way the government doles out its privileges?   Age 16:  you can operate a car, the thing responsible for more deaths in this country than firearms, alcohol, and cigarettes  Age 17:  pass  Age 18:  you can vote for the leader of the free world, and die for him in the military  Age 19:  you can buy cigarettes  Age 20:  pass  Age 21:  you can buy firearms and alcohol, both starting on the same day   That's six years and six privileges.  I think they should make it one privilege per year, and perhaps rethink the order, especially allowing people to legally get drunk and buy a shotgun on the same day.  Learn to use one responsibly before starting with the other, I say.  I thought that it might be a good idea to let people choose their own order (you just know voting and joining the military are going to the bottom of most lists), but then I realized a group of friends could circumvent the whole situation.  "Ok, guys, we're all turning sixteen this year.  Bob, you get your license, Jim, you're on beer duty, and I'll get the shotguns."  Smarmy, out

      Given the tense state of affairs in the world, I thought people might benefit from my military experiences.  I could write forever on this subject.  So, here I go.  Brief history - I wanted to embark on a career which involved killing people, but I knew if I did it at home I could get into trouble, plus I'd have to pay for my own ammo.  Instead, I got your tax dollars to provide me with weapons I could never legally obtain and a few medals for being good with them by joining the Army (infantry).  During basic training, they asked us to volunteer for what type infantry and places of service we wanted.  I asked for Georgia in the US, Korea abroad, and regular light infantry, which are the guys on the ground with rifles or machine guns.  Just so you know, the other infantry types were mortarmen, anti-tank (TOW missile operators), and mechanized infantry, which is the last thing I wanted since that sounded like being more of a tanker which I then viewed as the antithesis of the infantry.  They had light infantry in Georgia and Korea, but instead I got mechanized infantry and was sent to Germany (when I rotated back to the states, I was sent to Texas).  In Germany I was assigned a SAW, which is a belt-fed machine gun with a kickass name.  In my first qualification I found myself in a three-way tie for best score (there were about a hundred of us competing that day).  The instructors even used my zeroing target as an example of the accuracy of the weapon - using single shots, my shot groups were so close that most of the bullet holes overlapped.  So my fearless leaders, in the can-do spirit that has somehow managed to win wars, decided I needed to be a driver.  Naturally, I was pissed.  I joined the Army to spray people with lead, and found myself in a peaceful place driving a quasi-tank.  BTW, I recommend watching  urlLink The Pentagon Wars  for anyone who wants to see military leadership in action - it's about the development of that rotten vehicle I had to drive.  Anyway, in protest of my situation I decided to become the worst driver in history.  I rammed everything I could get my treads on, and generally caused as much damage and embarrassment to my leaders I could.  My fellow soldiers joked that they should paint icons of trees, signs, and fence posts on the side like they sometimes do for fighter pilots who shoot down enemy planes.  I got yelled at a lot, but not sent back to the fighting ranks.  The problem with driving a 13 ton vehicle is that most things hit by it take all the damage. That's where good old mother Earth came in handy.  Trees got batted aside with no more than a bump felt inside, but if I could ram something solid like an embankment I could cause injury to my passengers.  Sometimes I even managed to get the thing airborne, and if aimed just right, it didn't land softly.  The guys riding in back didn't like it, but they suffered through the bruises because they supported my rebellion.  The TC (track commander - my personal handler) got wise to this so he would shout over the comm system for me to stop or turn when he saw danger.  Then ReForGer (Return of Forces to Germany) came. It's a month-long field exercise wherein the generals play chess with the units by moving them around on the map, to which the units respond by imitating those movements in reality and firing blanks at each other.  I had become disappointed in my failure to fail as a driver, and had become somewhat complacent.  As a result, everyone onboard had quit perpetually bracing for impact.  One day while making a mock suicidal charge (we were racing across an open field at a company of tanks - real tanks, much more powerful than our infantry vehicles) I looked through the periscope and saw what appeared to be a small ridge cutting across our path.  I slowed, expecting the halt order, but it never came.  Thinking maybe the TC was distracted, I stomped on the gas pedal and got the thing up to full speed, all the time looking at that little ridge.  Periscopes tend to distort depth, and as I approached I noticed it was actually a drainage ditch, the far side being higher than the near side.  The halt order never came, so the vehicle plunged into the ditch and hit the far side so hard it rebounded.  My head (fortunately protected by a helmet) slammed into the front of the metal hatch, then rebounded and hit the back, then the the front and back one more time.  Nobody was seriously injured, although we were all physically stunned and the gunner tore the padding off the gun sights with his face (one side swelled for a few days).  I was the first to recover, and my first lucid thought was "Hey. He didn't tell me to stop."  So I stomped on the gas again and tore through the ditch (they can climb small obstacles if you don't ram them at full speed).  I picked out the tank I wanted to plow into and raced toward him, but it wasn't even close.  "Stooooooop!!!" came screaming over the comm system when I was still about 60 meters away.  So I stopped.  God forbid I disobey an order.  The TC hurled invectives and profanity at me for several minutes, and all I could do was sit there and think "Yesss!  I f**ked up big!  I'm out, baby."  After awhile, he calmed down and switched off his microphone.  When he returned, he said "Okay, that wasn't your fault.  I didn't tell you to stop."  Turns out the cord connecting his helmet to the comm system had disconnected.  I was crushed.  Apparently the only real offense for an enlisted man is to not blindly follow orders, which I didn't want to do because I had a sense of honor and a desire to avoid the stockade.  My fellow soldiers comforted me (some were bleeding) by telling me that was a really good one, really caught them off guard.  They were afraid I'd been tamed.  Anyway, I stayed faithful to the cause and continued to cause as much destruction as possible (I took out a yield sign and part of a drainage culvert on the way back to the base) until they released me from driving duty, which, as it turns out, was never.  I didn't get a new assignment until I rotated back to the States.  They made me a typist.  Go infantry.  Looking back now, I realize that I wouldn't trade those memories for anything (even though I'm glad I'm out).  Thanks for paying for all that.  If you're too young to be a taxpayer, be sure to thank your parents for me.  Patriotic, out

      For the feedback on my  urlLink template ,  urlLink Lor  and  urlLink Bakagirl .  I liked having the background image locked into place, but it interferes with the posts and links.  I think the trick to a good layout is balancing functionality with artistry - too much of the former is boring, too much of the latter makes for difficult reading.  As for the background music, I thought of using one of my  urlLink chainsaw  sound effects in an infinite loop, but then I couldn't stand to be on my own site for more than 30 seconds.  I think I'll toy with it some more and try again.  Learning, out

      A long time ago (4th grade) in a galaxy far, far away (Tennessee), I started at a new school.  One teacher gave us a test on our first day back from summer vacation.  The instructions said to read the entire test carefully, then start over and begin answering the questions.  Naturally we thought this was stupid, so most of us just started answering right away.  Question 1 said to put our names on the paper.  I forget the rest, but the final question said (what else) "Now go back and only do #1."  This started about 95% of the class with a 0, but it taught me a valuable lesson - don't trust the authority figure.  To that teacher, Mrs. Whatever Your Name Was, I would like to say that, wherever you are, I hope you're in a lot of pain and missing a couple of limbs.  Grey matter, out

      For those who don't know, the nanotechnology concept generally revolves around swarms of cell-sized robots working to accomplish a task.  This concept has existed for at least a decade, and yet the world has seen no practical application.  It's time to put this theory into its obvious practical use, namely - programmable beer.  The way it would work is you would grab your beer from the fridge and say "Hey, Beer.  I said something stupid today.  Take care of it."  And the beer would target those brain cells rather than killing at random.  You could literally drink away an unhealthy relationship.  Before I apply for the patent, I'll need a name.  Nano-beer?  Botweiser?  Nanny-nanny-boo-beer?  I'm also having trouble with a slogan.  "Beer - it's not just for breakfast anymore" is the best I've come up with.  Any suggestions?

       urlLink April Fool's Day :  This seemed like a typical entry into the 70's and 80's gory but not scary type of horror movies with a group of attractive teens stranded somewhere.  They begin to die one at a time.  I'm not sure how it turned out since I got bored and stopped it halfway through. - 2 out of 5 stars   urlLink Runaway Jury :  a strong cast playing mostly unsympathetic characters adds a lot of tension to this thriller.  Very little time is actually spent in court.  I never read the book, but this feels closer to a Grisham courtroom thriller than the other hack jobs I've seen.  Right at the end, however, it suddenly turns a little too cuddly. - 3.5 out of 5 stars

        urlLink Sarcasmo  is getting a  urlLink robot .  I want a robot.  It's lonely in my apartment sometimes.  I could use a mechanical pal to chat with, and help clean, and kill intruders.  Not that I ever get any intruders, but if I had a robot, I'd advertise.  (Sign on the front door - "Free Money Inside.  Don't Knock - Just Barge Right In.")  I'd have to make a few home modifications.  Asimov's laws would be simplified as follows:   Grant is not a target.  Unless he's feeling suicidal or needs to be euthanized.  Everybody else can take their chances.   Then of course, I'd have to upgrade the hardware - chainsaws, flame-throwers, machine guns, keg tap, MP3 player, rocket launcher, feather duster, and maybe a built-in doomsday device.  Talk about your killer aps, hee hee hee.  Anyway, when I get the robot, party at my place!  Everyone's invited.  Don't knock - just barge right in.  Call ahead so I'll know to take cover.

      I found a  urlLink blog  that posed the question "If I knew that I could live well and fully for another 6 months.. and then I would just cease to exist, what would I do with my time?" I thought about this for a moment. Laugh? Cry? Commit suicide? Then the truth revealed itself to me: killing spree.  I know most people would go with something like "Backpack around Europe" or "Find true love," but think about it. I'm guaranteed to live "well and fully" for six months, which means I won't be going to jail or dropping in a hail of police bullets. Normally I have to face the fact that if I kill people, I might get into some kind of trouble. So that's my answer: 179 days of mayhem and violence, pillaging and plundering. To accomplish this, I think I'll need a horned viking helmet and a  urlLink Harley-Davidson   urlLink Fatboy  equipped with a scabbard on each side, one for my chainsaw and another for my flame-thrower.  On the 180th day I'd visit every church, temple, and mosque I could find and beg forgiveness from every god I could think of. Then I'd go for a banana daiquiri and calmly await the inevitable.  So, what would you do?  Terminal, out

       urlLink Sarcasmo   urlLink posted  a bit about the joys of having some alone time to spend dancing and singing without fear of prying eyes.  Her comments made me wonder if this rapture encompasses all forms of music, or are there complications that could arise.  But, before I get into that, let me make a couple of notes.  NOTE TO WOMEN - There are few things in life sexier than a woman singing and dancing with complete abandon, even if she's wearing baggy sweats and doing it off-key and a little dorky.  A lot of you could probably make some money with a web cam.  NOTE TO MEN - I don't think the same is true for us.  Anyway, I considered it and decided the singing and dancing thing doesn't really work for metalheads like me.  There's no way to get a decent mosh pit going by yourself (without having the replace the furniture daily), and I can tell you from experience that it's not a good idea to stage dive from the top of the computer desk's hutch.  NOTE TO FLUFFY - I'm sorry.  RIP.  Instead, guys like me play air guitar where we basically pretend to be the lead guitarist of the band playing.  We jam on our air (invisible) guitars, howl into the air microphone, and point to the air babes in the audience, frequently while drinking real beer.  In my 20's I was at the top of my game.  You may laugh at that, but one night I gave a concert where I played both guitars simultaneously, switched to bass at random, sang all vocals, and even did a drum solo.  The air groupies went wild.  Part of my success was due to the stereo system I had at the time which violated most arms reduction treaties around the globe.  The bass notes sounded like detonating warheads; I could stun cattle at a hundred paces.  This enabled me to share my talent with my neighbors, who often showed their appreciation by having the police drop by to inquire about my well-being.  NOTE TO POLICE - No, I'm not on any drugs.  No, I don't think I need to be.  Quit asking already.  Sadly, I'm no longer in my air prime.  I've traded my assault stereo for computer speakers, and I can only kick out the jams with an 87% success rate.  I no longer play for my neighbors...  NOTE TO NEIGHBORS - Stop sending the thank-you notes.  I get your freakin' point.  ...and just jam to myself.  But I still have fun.  In fact, I feel a jam session coming on tonight.  NOTE TO AIR GROUPIES - I'll be in my trailer after the show.  Rock, out  P.S.  The spell-checker keeps trying to change freakin' to foreskin.  Somebody needs to tell the google people that a little careless blogging could make for some strange posts.

      Sorry, I forgot to add my own smarmy answers to the quiz I created.  I also changed the order of the questions so it wouldn't look like two were related.  In order to promote web harmony, the following is a list of 10 things everybody should know about you. Please copy and paste into your own blog with the appropriate answers.   Favorite band? Slayer.

      I've decided that, on a personal level, I don't like you.  No offense.  I've always maintained that I respect christians who 1) actually attempt to keep the faith they espouse, and 2) don't espouse it too loud, at least not to me.  However, after a recent brush with  urlLink The Way of the Master , I looked up the bible quote they reference, Mark 16:15, which states (from the King James version) "And he (jesus) said unto them, 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.'"  Therefore, any christian who does not evangelize their faith is guilty of hypocrisy, which I hate.  What I hate even more are christians who make it their business to preach to me every time we meet until I give in and convert just so they'll shut the hell up.  (Note to said xtians - not gonna happen)  By the way, if you take a literal translation of the above quote, it called for them to preach to every creature, not just humans.  The next time somebody starts preaching to you, interrupt them by saying "Oh, yeah?  You're so pious, tell me how many squirrels you've converted lately.  Huh?  HUH?"  Then, while their brain resets, you can either run or hose them down with your flame-thrower.  They won't mind - they're going to a better place.  And while we're on that, why isn't it legal to kill christians?  According to their constitutionally protected beliefs, all you've done is improved their lives.  Their suffering has ended and they now go to sit at the base of the throne of god and bask in his glow for all eternity.  You don't deserve jail for that - you deserve a reward.  And I couldn't help but read the next verse which states "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."  Nothing about not sinning or obeying the commandments, just believe and have a priest dunk you in the pool and you're good to go.  Amen (read: take that).  Halle Berry, brother.  Now let's go out and kill and pillage and plunder and smoke dope in the name of jesus.  Of course, some claim their bible doesn't include those statements.  I noticed the Way of the Masterites were selling something called the Evidence bible.  I don't know what that's about, and I don't want to know.  These days we seem to have more bibles than breakfast cereals.  Technically, xtians whose bibles don't have the quotes I've mentioned can be devout and non-evangelical, so I could like them, but I still don't because they're just complicating matters.  Over 1,100 pages in that book and I can't read two verses without having major issues.  I'm going back to my  urlLink Stephen King  novel.  Theological, out.

      I don't remember last night's dream(s) completely, but when I awoke this morning I did retain a little flash.  I dreamt about a guy going for a job interview.  He walked into a crowded office and the receptionist told him they were running behind, so he would have to wait.  He sat in a plastic chair in the hot office, resume in hand, glanced around and passed the time making small talk with the people around him.  My point of view drew back and passed through the wall to a darkened office, where somebody was monitoring him by camera, recording his image and responses and an array of vital statistics (heart rate, temperature, etc.).  Then I realized all the people in the waiting room except the applicant were actors, and they interacted with him in a preplanned manner so his responses could be tested.  Apparently, he was in the interview without realizing it.  Weird, out

      Here's an interesting concept I've been dealing with at work - theory versus reality.  I want to deal with reality (which is normally a strange concept to me), but my bosses want me to work in theory.  Here's the argument:  IN THEORY, the servers are great and powerful machines connected to the users by high-speed reliable connections, therefore all data processing should take place on their end.  IN REALITY, the servers are based on old technology and are overloaded, as is the network connecting them to us.  That's been the SOP since I started here over three years ago, and it doesn't look like it will change anytime soon.  That's why I prefer to write queries that simply ask the servers to dump some data into my PC and let me do all the calculations locally.  Fearless Leader(s) insist I have the server perform all calculations then spit out the final results.  I do things their way since I'm not paid to think (that's a management function), but I should be allowed to use their "logic" against them. Boss:  When are you going to have my reports ready? Me:  In theory, they were on your desk an hour ago.  01001101, out

      I have an idea that will make millions of dollars, but I need somebody with a little engineering skill to create it.  It's called the Flamesaw.  Anybody who knows anything about me knows my favorite recreational items are the flame-thrower and the chainsaw, so naturally I wondered how to combine the two.  I envision your standard two-stroke chainsaw with a couple of subtle changes:  1) a fuel tank strapped to your back, feeding both the engine and the 2) gas jets which will replace every other blade.  Now it will be blade, burner, blade, burner (or to your victims - cut, cauterize, cut, cauterize).  We need to jump on this one people.  Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming and I don't want to look like a dufus.  At least, not an unarmed dufus.  BTW, if you're wondering how this will make us millions of dollars, I propose the following:  1) build the Flamesaw, 2) patent the Flamesaw, 3) approach a wealthy entrepreneur, and 4) inform him that if he does not give us millions of dollars we will cut/burn him to the ground.  Ha ha evil cackle glee, out  P.S. While typing this, I inadvertently spelled "Engineering" as "Enginerring." I think I just created a new Dilbertism.

      Teeth, that is.  I've noticed lately that a large number of people out there in blogland are getting their wisdom teeth removed, which reminds me of my own ordeal.  I had mine removed later than most, when I was in Germany in the Army.  They did it in two separate operations, one for the uppers and one for the lowers.  The uppers went as well as could be, and they sent me back to the barracks with some Tylenol 3 (the stuff with codeine).  Those pills were supposed to last me for awhile, but after a few beers some other soldiers convinced me to share, so we took the whole bottle that night.  I don't remember much, but I was told it looked like I had fun.  The problem came when I went back to have the lowers removed.  The first proved tougher than usual to remove, but the second was the real shocker - it had three roots.  The dentist seemed surprised, but not completely shocked ("Hey, everybody. Come get a load of  this .").  Instead of being able to pull it, he had to use his drill to score hatchmarks in the tooth, then break it apart and remove the pieces.  I was mostly numb to the pain, but having to sit through that drill's scream as I felt the powder from my own tooth coat my tongue was sheer torture.  You'll be glad to know I divulged no information.  On the lighter side, they gave me some GREAT drugs for that one (no more of that girly Tylenol 3 stuff).  I don't know what it was, but I felt like I was floating, only in a little pain and not even caring about that.  Unfortunately the stuff tended to put me to sleep. I had to take one every twelve hours, and when I did I drifted through a state of euphoria for about thirty minutes, then passed out.  I'd wake up about a half hour before it was time for another, and I'd sit on my bunk in groggy dull pain, wishing that time would get the lead out.  Then, repeat.  That went on for a few days.  I don't know why I posted this.  It's not particularly helpful to anyone (like most of everything else I post).  Oh, wait, I do know why - it's almost time for lunch, and I didn't want to start a new project until I get back.  This bit wasted the perfect amount of time.  Food, out

A running joke was that boys always found  urlLink Scarlet Johansson  prettier than her ignored friend played by  urlLink Thora Birch , although I found Thora to be the more attractive.  A great entry into the genre of teenage angst movies, but for my money the topper is still  urlLink Heathers . - 3 out of 5 stars.   urlLink School of Rock  - cute and charming, but utterly safe.  Casting  urlLink Joan Cusack  as the principal was a brilliant move.  The movie also entertains the conceipt that 70's Rock was the best music ever made, which establishes  urlLink Jack Black 's generation (people tend to get locked into the music of their teen years).  - 2.5 out of 5 stars.

      So I think I'll get my real estate license. I'll hang out in some real estate office, and when an agent takes a client to a house I'll race ahead of them, cut off the power, hide in the attic and moan "get out" when they enter. Maybe I'll rattle some chains as well. Or I could just hide in the closet and, when they open the door, jump out and hose them down with my flamethrower.  Hee, hee.  The classic gags are the best.

      Let me state for the record that I'm not here looking for love or people to meet in person.  This blog is one of my creative outlets and I use it for entertainment.  When I search other people's blogs, I start by looking for a common element, usually people who claim to enjoy writing, but sometimes people who like the same books, music, and/or movies as me.  I get some matches, cruise their posts, and if I find them interesting I bookmark the location.  Again, I only care that the person has something intellectual or emotional to offer.  I don't make a conscious effort to learn who they are, although I often pick up a lot from their musings.  Having said that, I recently became aware of the fact that most of my favorite bloggers - the ones whose thoughts I enjoy perusing, the ones to whom I can most closely relate, the ones that really brighten my day - invariably turn out to be schoolgirls around age fifteen, frequently of Asian descent.  I have to admit that sometimes that does make me feel like a creepy old man.  Never mind that it shows me to be emotionally underdeveloped and a tad sissified, I'm used to that.  I'm more concerned that it makes me seem like I have some kind of fetish.  I'm not a predator or serial killer (as far as you or the police know), but if I were to become one I think I may have subconsciously identified my victims' demographics.  (Note to profilers - contrary to your beliefs, I apparently will not be be hunting within my own age or ethnic group)  Apologies if any of my comments on your blogs has offended you, unless you drive slow in the fast lane, in which case I hate your guts.  If you want me to stay away in the future, just let me know and I'll add you to my growing list of people to avoid - no hard feelings.  Ick, out

      Last night was movie night, but I didn't complete any movies since I wandered off and did other exciting things, like cooking dinner then cleaning the stove after I let a pot boil over (it boiled over because I wandered off and did something else).  Anyway, the only DVD I watched (partially) was disc one of the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon.  Holy cow, it was awful in every way - cheap animation, bad lines, women whose only role was to get tied-up by whatever villain and scream "Save me, Spider-Man."  I don't understand.  I used to love these back in nursery school (right after nap time when they were giving us our afternoon milk).  Things like this may be the reason many adults still view animation as a purile form of entertainment.  The only exposure they had was to the silly and pathetic cartoons of their day which were largely insulting to the intelligence of a seven-year old (me, anyway).  Like most people, they fall back on their internal rules rather than re-evaluate.  Web, out

      Tonight is movie night, so there won't be any writing, but I did receive my contributor's copy of  urlLink Black Petals  containing my 6th published short story "A Brief Future of Television."  The editor, Kenneth James Crist, said the story was "just too cute to pass up" (it involves a woman getting her head blown off by a shotgun for entertainment purposes).  An artist named Tom Kelly drew a full page illustration to go with it, and it kicks ass.  Yes!  Somebody illustrated my work!  I rule!  I'm much more talented than you are.  AHHH HA HA HAAAH!  I WILL CRUSH YOU LIKE A BUG!  THE STREETS WILL RUN RED WITH BLOOD, AND POSSIBLY YELLOW AND GREY WITH BILE AND BRAIN MATTER.  But no puss, because that would just be so icky-poo.  Okay, I'm back on planet Earth now.  In related news, I sent another story called "The Path" to  urlLink Wierd Tales  back in June, but haven't yet received my rejection.  I'll give them a couple weeks more to stomp on my heart, then follow up if they haven't done so.  Published, out

      Last night's religious post kind of wandered off the high-dive.  Sorry, but I can't fulfill my promise of anger because I wasn't angry then or now.  I just started to tick myself off while I was reviewing my religious upbringing, because it's important to my actual point, which I will get to eventually.  To sum up, here is a list of my sole parental unit's current beliefs, which I am (unfortunately) not making up:    The catholics are right in that god, jesus, and the holy ghost (the holy trinity) are one.   All catholic priests are scum who only join the church to get easy access to altar boys.   Abortion is so wrong that it is good when a devout christian blows away a doctor who works at a woman's clinic with a shotgun. And his driver. And his driver's wife (this actually happened, although I think the wife survived).   Anyone remotely associated with an abortion clinic should die in the name of jesus, who is love.   It's not sinning if you get someone else to do it for you.   You, personally, are going to Hell.   There is no god, wait...the mormons are right, wait...the baptists are right, wait...the other baptists are right, wait...only I am right.   All beliefs subject to change with no warning.  As for myself, I think Firm Non-Believer is the best way to describe me.  Anyway, what started this whole thing was an anonymous comment I received a couple of days ago that told me "I KNOW WHAT YOUR DAMN PROBLEM IS. YOU NEED TO FIND JESUS http://www.wayofthemaster.com/"  The funny thing is that it was in relation to a post that had nothing to do with religion. First off, let me set the proper tone.  I am not the least bit upset because I love getting comments and I love angering christianic whack jobs, so that was a two-fer.  For fun, I checked out the web site and found it to be very well designed, but fruity as a nutcake.  Then doubt began to settle in and I wondered if it was all a joke.  If so, it's very funny, but funnier if these people are actually serious.  All two of the people I talked to about this seemed to think it was obviously a joke, but I'm not convinced (yes, somehow I manage to be cynical and gullible at the same time).  After all, I only have to go up one branch of the family tree to find a profane religious extremist.  The web site has a reference to Mark 16:15, to which I was told that only the bibles belonging to snake handlers go beyond Mark 15:13.  I consulted my King James version, which is obviously the one true immutable word of the lord (ver 2.3) since it is translated into olde English, and it encompasses Mark 16:20.  I still haven't made up my mind on this one, and would appreciate some help. Go to  urlLink http://www.wayofthemaster.com/  and browse around.  The non-christian intro is fun since it informs us that we are all guilty of breaking every commandment and will burn in Hell without their help.  As an added incentive, ladies, Kirk Cameron is their spokesman.  Please let me know what you think, silly or serious?  List reasons.  Don't give them any credit card numbers or eat anything they hand you.  Holy crap, out

      You know what I haven't done since I started blogging? No, not that (keep your filthy thoughts to yourself). I haven't railed on religion. But I will now.  First off, let me say that I have the greatest respect for people of faith who half (okay, three-quarter) ass make an attempt to follow the guidelines they espouse. I may not agree with you, but as a some-color blooded American, I believe in your right to believe. Having said that, I strenuously urinate on those who proselytize a religion without following its basic tenets (read: hypocrites).  To understand my position, you need my history. For those of you without the benefit of a spare lifetime, I will summarize:  At age six my mother sat us down (me, my older sister, and herself) and informed us: Mom: WE don't believe in the bible. (even at that age, I wanted to question the wisdom of flatly informing me of what WE believed, but I didn't. I respected her ability to hit.) Mom: I think a bunch of people just made it up, then a bunch of fools decided to believe in it.  Okay, so we were atheists. Flash forward seven years, after the mormon missionaries talked to us. Mom: WE believe in the bible, book of mormon, pearl of great wisdom and whatever else I say.  Flash forward three years to some Baptist church. Mom: WE don't agree with the mormons. They are a bunch of godless heathens. Sunday School Teacher: Rock music takes control of your mind and makes you commit heinous acts, like underaged sex and taking drugs. Me: These people are weird. Mom: Shut up. Church is in session. Preacher: Women should be subservient to the needs of their men. Mom: WE're gone.  Next year at another Baptist church (hey, where you gonna go around here?). Preacher: Breadwinners, do your thing as long as you pitch in 10%. Mom: WE are Baptists.  I'll pick this up tomorrow.  I promise anger then.  Messianic, out

Fortunately you only exist inside my head, so I can safely say you suck.  urlLink Connie : My muse, without whom I would have never blogged in the first place. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not that's a good thing. Grant:  you are my god, all-knowing without ever being exasperating or preaching about the coming of the Giant Atomic Chickens - oh, wait.  That's me.  Nevermind.  urlLink Heidi : Colorful without color, normal but never boring. Rock On!  urlLink Lor : Funny despite (or because of) your rapid mood swings, you leave me in awe of your artistic capability. May you never go offline.  If I have offended anyone, it's because  urlLink somebody  knocked me unconscious and posted in my stead.

      When I was in high school, I belonged to a band called Dick Rot (our symbol was DR with a circle drawn around it for no reason at all).  We had only two members, so if anyone claims you can't form a metal band with only two people, they are wrong.  If they claim you can't form a decent metal band with only two people, then I'm not in any position to comment.  My friend was the lead singer and bass player*.  He held those positions because he owned the tape recorder and the bass guitar, which he could actually play a little.  I was the backup vocalist (because I didn't own the tape recorder), drummer (I'll get to that later), and lead/only guitarist because I had the guitar.  I couldn't actually play it, so my friend (who couldn't play it either) strummed out some notes by treating it like a small bass with two extra strings.  I handled the drum role by banging my social studies book on his night stand.  We were both fervently driven by our artistic desire to make money and score chicks, so we practiced for several long minutes, then eventually managed to record a couple of songs.  I forget their titles, but basically we packed all thirty seconds (that was as far as our talent would take us) with as much imagery of psychotic violence, sex, drugs and profanity we could muster.  "The F-Bombs" would have been a better name for us, for more reasons than one.  Christians would picket our concerts, if we held any, although I'm sure our performance would drive them into the churches faster than their pamphlets, if only for the improvement in music.  I should have practiced something other than the guitar, like being quiet.  I didn't have the dexterity to play such a nimble instrument.  I needed something larger and more blunt, perhaps a gong or a nuclear weapons testing range.  What I really wanted to play was the bass, but thought that two would be superfluous.  In retrospect, I don't think it would have hurt.  The sad thing is that I didn't make up any of the preceeding facts.  Needless to say, we didn't make a lot of money, and if we scored it was out of pity. I've  been thinking of starting up a reunion tour.  Order your tickets now. If you pay us enough, we may bypass your town.  Rhythm, out  * Pengy, if you're reading this, he's divorced and I might be able to hook you up.

      Actually, it's the clown's night off.  I'm just having another bout of insomnia, which is business as usual for me.  I don't understand why I can't sleep at night.  I sleep fine all day long.  (kidding)  Thinking back, this is two years after the worst bout I ever had, lasting exactly thirty days.  I don't mean I didn't sleep at all for a month, but most days I slept a maximum of two hours in no more than fifteen minute intervals.  I think I heard it put best in  urlLink Fight Club :  "When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep and you're never really awake."  I remember spending the entire night crawling around my bed, trying to get comfortable in any available position.  At one point I was curled in the fetal position at the foot of the bed watching miniature soldiers gather and battle around the terrain (comprised of rumpled sheets and my pillows) near the headboard.  As I watched the glowing scores floating above the combatants heads, I kept trying to remember which side I was on.  Then the sun rose and I went to work.  Nobody noticed anything different.  The waking dreams would have been really cool if I hadn't been too exhausted to enjoy them.  I guess I'll go read another chapter of  urlLink Steven King 's  urlLink Wolves of the Calla .  It's good bedtime material.

      I've been noticing a trend while cruising the blogs.  The adults seem generally obsessed with minutia, the boring trivia of unfulfilled lives (see my previous  urlLink rant ), while the teens are mired down in (what else) the angst of being teens.  As a person who has not only been there and done that, but has also worn the t-shirt (at least until I spilled marinara sauce on it) I would like to offer my perspective in the hopes that it will ease your pains and guide you through the next years.  When I was in high school, I was plagued by the feeling that I possessed a superior intelligence, especially compared to those who would call themselves my teachers.  I eventually graduated, lived a little, and gained a new insight.  In retrospect, after only a few passing years, I realized that I had been completely right the whole time and that I had now grown big enough to stomp the holy crap out of them.  Unfortunately, by then I had moved.  Our parents always insisted that our generation had it much easier than theirs, something which I'm sure their parents told them and so on back to the stone age when Og told Grok not to bash his little sister over the head with his club, and to turn his hat the right way.  On the flip side, my fellow high-schoolers always insisted that today's youth (meaning us) had it harder than any generation before.  Like everybody else, I was eager to believe that I faced the toughest obstacles, but I just couldn't accept it.  Sure, the technology and the pace of life was ever-increasing, but I believe those are just details, dressings over the actual wounds.  I think the real problem with being a teenager is that you are a person aged between twelve and twenty.  Those are very trying years, no matter who or where you are or whether your idea of high-tech is an MP3 player or a butter churn with a tassled handle.  They are the years that you bridge the gap between the child you were and the adult you will become.  They are the critical years for developing relationships and abilities to cope, and it's those that are so important.  Life for adults is not easier; we've just had more experience in dealing with it.  We have spent years developing coping mechanisms, such as Denial, Self-Loathing, and Beer.  It's like watching a concert pianist and marveling at the way her hands float over the keys.  She doesn't have an easier piano; she has dedicated years to honing her craft.  As loathe as I am to try to offer advice, I have to put in my two cents (3.5 with interest) and stress how important it is that you develop the right skills during this time.  I don't have to tell you what they are - deep down, you already know (hint - it's the difficult choice).  Many decisions in our lives come to what's easy versus what's right; they rarely overlap.  Taking the easy route will get you through the day, and sometimes that's the best you can do, but in the end it will make you a highly-skilled loser.  Trust me - I've seen potential evolve into a dedicated waste of space.  Now, many moons later, I can look back at a time almost half of my life ago and imagine the smiling faces of the teachers and faculty I once hated and feared.  I can see their aged and careworn faces, and I can smile at them, secure in the knowledge that, not only am I still much younger and can kick the crap out of them, but (thanks to my military training) I can kill them with a wet noodle.  Don't even get me started on all the hours I spent on the ranges firing machine guns and tossing grenades.  If they're smart, they'll stay out of my way (gun sights).  I hope this helps. It helped me. If I had taken the time to say all this to a therapist, I wouldn't be able to afford fuel for my collection of flame-throwers and chainsaws.  Psychological, out.

      I went home and had a nap for lunch, so now I'm feeling much better.  Sick days are wasted on sick people.  Do yourself a favor - if at all possible, drag your diseased carcass into work and make them pay you for your inefficient, germ-laden time.  That way you get to reserve your sick days, or "unannounced vacation days" as I like to call them, for when you can take full advantage.  The cherry on this plan is that, if you puke at work, somebody else can clean it up.  Note - the last doesn't apply if you are the janitor / custodian / waste management engineer.  Of course, you still have to call in sick.  Most managers wouldn't like to hear "Bob?  I'm not coming to work today.  It's beautiful outside and I feel great and I don't want to waste it on the likes of you."  Which begs the obvious question, why can't we call in temporarily insane?  We'd still be lying, but it would be a trifle more honest since we wouldn't be using our fake *sick* voice. Instead, in a perfectly normal (even chipper) tone we could say "Bob?  I'm not coming to work today.  The iridescent bunnies that live under my bathroom sink are beginning to chant 'Stay home and polish your chainsaws' and I know better than to ignore them."  The next day you show up, explain the insanity was temporary, and all the stuff's the same.  Feel free to use these ideas at your place of work / education / worship.  Also feel free to take all the credit yourself.  Really, I don't mind.  Wisdom, out.  P.S. I typed this at work, so I got paid for it.

      Another solid Michael Crichton thriller, this one featuring the emergence of nanotechnology and our inability to predict the results of its application. The narrative is interspersed with a lot of technical explanations, although not long enough to slow the tension of the story. Techno-geeks will probably find a way to pick the story apart (you know who you are - fingers stained orange by Cheetohs, chugging a Mountain Dew, and arguing online for the fourth straight hour why Captain Kirk's safe combination couldn't be 3 - 17 - 39), but for the rest of us, the science seems believable. Crichton did his usual mountain of research, and he is on familiar grounds. - 4 out of 5 stars.

       urlLink feardotcom  was a competent but unremarkable horror story. The plot was a little more inventive than most, although just as silly and filled with people doing things that made me think "Why the hell did they do  that ?" The biggest detriment to the movie was the lack of sympathetic characters. Also funny is the fact that the evil web site was actually feardotcom.com. - 2.5 out of 5 stars

      Still dragging today.  Too tired to go to the gym, so I'll just have to lay around and pursue my intellectual interests.  Which leads me to:  Review -  urlLink The Wild World of Batwoman  The is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen for every reason.  Even the MST3K guys couldn't do much with it.  Fortunately, it also contained an old educational short about the effects of cheating.  - 0 out of 5 stars for the movie; 1.5 out of 5 stars if you count the Cheating short and the MST3K bots.
