       Well, tomorrow is the beginning of my journey back into the heart of graduate education in Fort Worth.  I'm feeling a little nervous about it all, but on the whole, I think that it will be a good place for me to be for the next 3 years or so.  I'm pretty tired right now, but I figured I would post a little ditty before I went to bed to "mark" the occasion of my foray back into the proverbial fire.  I'll let you know how things go tomorrow night.  Hopefully my iBook will be here by then.  Cheers.

       What is our obsession with all things digital?  (Yes, I realize that there is some irony in the fact that I'm using something along those lines)  Does this not add to the typical sentiment in today's culture of always needing the newest and most efficient product?  It seems to me that in a throw away culture where old TVs are thrown out because we want HDTV, we might want to look back and evaluate what progress looks like.  Relationships have become like images on a digital camera.  You don't like that picture?  Just delete it and nobody will be the wiser, and you have more space now to take a better one.  Back in the days where everyone used the good old Pentax single lens reflex camera you had to be careful to set the aperture and exposure times correctly or your picture would come out looking either white or too dark to make out the desired object.  The same could be said of our dependence on computers.  When people used type-writers, they had to figure out how they wanted to say it right the first time.  Similarly, we don't have the luxury of a delete button for our relationships.  We're a generation obsessed with experience, and it seems like we've become even more disillusioned when we realize that our actions have concrete consequences that we can't erase or throw away.  Let's try to recapture the beauty of the well prepared photo taken by an SLR camera in the way we deal with others!  Being fully present and incarnational in our relationships will help us to become a throwback to the cultures of old when people had time to listen and weren't interrupted by the ringing of a cell phone or the chime of a PDA.

       I was thinking about a friend the other day who was in the process of developing a relationship with a co-worker who was curious about life, love, and the pursuit of happiness.  His past experiences exhibited little in the way of arrows pointing the way to God.  In fact, if you looked carefully, you might only find chaos.  So I tried to think of a biblical response or address to someone who feels like life has dealt them some crappy cards, some poor building blocks for a stable spiritual life.  Perhaps it would be helpful, in biblical terms, to look at Genesis 1 and the Priestly account of creation.  I think that we often think that God is a God who creates something out of nothing (creatio ex nilo), but this chapter of creation says that the earth was "formless and void."  The Hebrew words for "formless void" refer to a state of disorder and chaos.  Interpreted in this way, we see creation as God's ordering of disorder, God's action to bring an end to chaos and to replace it with something intentional, something capable of sustaining life.  We see chaos in the world, like my friend's co-worker mentioned, and we see God's absence.  However, what if we saw the chaos in terms of formless material through which God could form great things, beautiful things, redemptive things?  While we may wish that there were no chaos in the world, life would be boring without it.  The key is not to get overwhelmed by confusion or become disillusioned with disorder but to see our role as co-creators with God to take part in the God's creative activity in the world.  Who knows, maybe this God who performs great works with disorderly material will be able to redeem our chaotic pasts through this same creative action.  Even more exciting is our role in that continual creative activity, for we, too, are the incarnation of God for this world.  It is my prayer that we will see our pasts not as something that impedes God's ability to order our personal chaos but as the material through which God is able to reveal once again the Divine intention to redeem all creation.  In answering this prayer God will equip us to act in accordance with being made in the image of God as we learn how to make something beautiful out of chaos.

       So, I was thinking to today about Thursdays.  Not quite as exciting as Fridays, but much better than the first three days of the week.  The first three days of the week attempt to make us forget about the previous weekend.  Thursdays are anticipatory.  It's Friday eve, if you will.  It's primary identity is linked with being the day closest to the weekend without actually being the weekend.  It's almost but not quite officially the weekend.  To me, Thursdays usher in the time for celebration, for Friday is coming up and with it the weekend.  This is how I see the kingdom of God.  Jesus is constantly saying that the kingdom is upon us, but he also prays that the kingdom will come.  It's here, and it's coming.  It's in our midst, and it's just beyond our intellectual grasp.  The one thing I know about Thursdays is that I participate more fully in the weekend when I am intentional about my treatment of the day that comes before.  Perhaps the same can be said of the kingdom of God.
