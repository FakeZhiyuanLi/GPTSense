      I know it is very cheesy to say, but the ad slogan is true, I Love this Game.  What the NBA playoffs has provided me, and maybe a few others, the past two nights was spectacular.  Actually there is still half a game to go between the Wolves and Kings, but I have to talk about the miracle finishes.  Derek Fisher, Tim Duncan, and Chaucny Billups.  Three very differnt players all making incredible plays.  Fisher the all time role player that is all he is and all he ever will be.  Billups is the definition of solid pro, a true starter and a guy who may make a few all star games by the time it is all said and done with (the Tino Martinez of the NBA).  Then we come to Tim Duncan, nothing short of a Hall of Famer by the time he hangs up the shoes.  All three hit the biggest shots of their lives, and only one of them won the game.  The Lakers were basically given up for dead at this time last week.  They were down 2-0 to the Spurs nobody could stop Michael Jordan (a.k.a. Tony Parker) and Tim Duncan was ruling over all matters having to do with the paint.  But a funny thing happened on the way to the Western Finals, that thing Kobe Bean Bryant.  He had 22,6,& 6 in game three an easy Laker victory and then he exploded for 42 in the pivotal game four to send the series even back to the SBC Center. Then comes game five where he slashed his way to the hoop in the second half making great plays and with under a minute to play he came off a screen and roll and knocked down a huge jumper.  Then with 11 seconds left the Spurs ran the clock down and tried to have the last shot.  Tim Duncan was attempting a dribble hand off with Manu Ginoboli adn instead he dribbled to the top of the key and squared for a shot with a 7'3 300lbs man in his face and calmly drianed a 19 foot jumpshot, in the manner he does all things.  Then comes Derrick Fisher what can you say?  Personally if I am a coach, I want Kobe to beat me, so I guard him well and if he gets it and hits it so be it.  By Horry double teaming Kobe you gave Payton a free look on the inbounds, which is the cardinal sin I believe.  But give Fisher the credit he made a big time shot.  Now to Chauncy Billups and hi amazing shot.  How many times have all of us done that, in fact Hall Beard and I do it at every arena we attend and usually we miss it.  I am one under the impression that the game Chauncy Billups played was very good.  Some think he took to many shots to score his thirty, but I will defend him and say he kept them in the game espcially in the first overtime when  all his good players had fouled out, and Tayshaun Prince was invisible (which sometimes happens with him).  Billups mad some key drives and even dished a few times, but he consitantly put pressure on the Nets defense and kept his team alive.  But in the end, as usual it was the inheralded who made the difference.  The world Famous Brian Scalabrine was the difference.  If you are drunk or high wehn you read this that last sentence was notp a typo.  The playoffs are great.  Don't let anyone steer you away from these games, don't let old people tell you about the good ole days, don't let people tell you these are spoiled millionaires.  Those things may all be true, but when it comes down to it Rasheed Wallace played 48 gutsy minutes on one foot and Kevin Garnett & Kobe Bryant play their balls off on every possesion.  Love this game with all your heart and the drama it provides.  Remember it is just an escape so enjoy sports for what they are, fabulous competitions between incredible athlets.  Non of these guys are heros or the answer to any of your problems or role models for your children, they are men playing a great game.  Thanks Dr. Naismith  Peace & Love  KD

      Okay this one goes on the what the hell were they thinking file.  First of all what the hell were they doing to these prisoners??  I mean San Quentin seems a safer place to be than this freaking place.  What was the purpose, that is what nobody has explained to me.  Were the soldiers just getting there kicks, were they attempting to interrogate these prisoners?  And then regardless of what they were doing who is the sick bastard who pulled out the Kodak and say hey lets get some snapshots of this crap.  Have we become this voyerisitc society that these pictures on any level would entertain anyone?    Finally this is an issue that everyone can agree on, this is totally intollerable.  I think every one of these soldiers should be dealt with swiftly and justly first by receiving a dishonorable discharge and then have to walk around with a scarlett letter on their chest or some other sort of public humiliation.  This war, occupation or whatever you want to call it is unpopular enough and now these morons have gone and made it even more unpopular.  And I do not mean just for the sake of those who wanted us to go to war, but for the safety of the young men and women over there.  We have seen already the horrible reprecussions that these actions can have, and now I am pissed and hope we kill more of them which probably is not the way I should be thinking, but this is the vicious cycle we get on when it comes to these problems.  I just hope we can stop any of this nonsense and continue to help rebuild the schools and economy of the country.    Hidden in all this maddness is one of the best stories to come out of this whole mess.  That story is of the Iraqi Olympic Soccer team who just the other day qualified for this summers Olympic games.  "It's a crazy joy for us," Iraq defender Ahmed Alwan said. "Despite all of the difficulties we faced, we still managed to qualify for Athens and I believe that we deserve our place in the Olympics." Now that is something we can be proud of, our disposing of Saddam Hussein and his Baath party helped get Iraq reinstated to the International Olympic Committee and allow these young men who love the sport of soccer to be able to compete for there country.  As Americans we can be proud of that.  Peace & Love  KD

      In between loathing my own existance and watching commercials during the basketball game last night I had a chacne to check out what was on VH1.  I used to like this channel but I must say it is seriously going down hill.  They were doing a countdown (all the rage in todays society, everything must have a list)on the "most Awsomely Bad Songs," whatever that means.    First off were does the list come from, who made it up, give me some sort of accountability here.  Secondly, they were taking songs in ever literally context of the words being said.  You could take any great songwrite or group and find some song where a lyric is stupid and doesn't make sense, in fact the Beatles were thought to have no shot at becoming big because of the lyric "She Loves you, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!" and they seemed to do okay with that song and their careers.  The other problem I had was all the people they had on doing commentary about these songs and these groups, again as the kids like to say had no street cred. I had only ever heard of 2 people on the hour long show and that was Matt Pinnfield and Comedian Jim Florentine.  They had all these other meaningless comedians on commenting, and not being funny I might add, whom I had never heard of.  Now obviously I do not know every comedian out there, but I watch a tremendous amount of stand up, all the shows that feature various comedians and I probably can identify 150 stand ups I know working today in the business and VH1 coudn't find any of them.  Lastly, if you are gonna do a countdown on what songs are good and bad, you should have certain people on to be the judge and make the list.  To name a few of those people you migh want Bob Dylan, BB King, Bruce Springsteen, Sir Paul Mcartney, and Chuck D.  That way you get a great sampling from all types of music and intelligent people who know something about lyrics and songwriting.    Peace and Love  KD

         Mostly I am not in favor or engaging a discussion about politics, but I am gonna give it a go here today.  I was listening to the radio today and they were talking about how close the polls are and how everyone hates Bush and how they all want him to die, and how he is the worst president of all time, and how our country has fallen apart in three years because of him and blah blah blah blah blah.        Two things, first no president is totally to blame for everything nor should he be given the total credit for anything that happens in his administartion(much like a starting QB in the NFL).  Every president is effected by the previuos regime, both positive and negative, congress & the house and the supreme court.  That was the point in creating a government that has three branches that operate together, so that one person was not given absolute power. The government continues to go on when someone new is elected it is not as iff we stop everything we were doing and start over, it is continuous. Two, your other choice was Al Gore, so it is not like we had a lot to choose from, and Ralph Nader and his crew do not really count, if tree hugging hippies took over this country we would all be dancing in open fields and singing Phish tunes.      Here is my point, sans the Fox news channel, everyone else who is on TV is as liberal as can be.  It is like you have to past some test, so to believe polls that you see on TV is probably not a good thing.  Here is the problem, especially when a republican is president, the liberals are so outraged every time he goes to the bathroom they just get on TV and yell and scream and wake Susan Saradon and Alec Baldwin up to yell and scream, but here is what the republicans do, VOTE!!!! Plain and simple when push comes to shove they turn out at the polls and vote, and that is why they win elections.  Liberal people a lot of the time are too busy making a picket sign or passing a petition around to realize that it is time to vote.       And it is time to get over the whole recount thing, hey Gore you and your Dad represented the state of Tennessee for the better part of 50 years (heck the highway system in Tennessee is named after your dad) and you could not even come close to winning your home state, in fact you lost your home county and most of the people there are related to you.      So if you really dislike what is going on then go vote and stop talking about it, and I don't mean vote for Ruben Stoddard or who should be off the island, but vote for some sort of office someone that matters.

      So I was looking over the NBA draft list yesterday and I saw the usually list of high schoolers, early entry college guys, and random foreign names that nobody has ever heard of (except  maybe Pavel Polkodzine, who somehow was in the draft last year and again this year, he is the 7’5 Siberian guy).  I then got to read an article about this Croatian kid who grew up in Sweden and is best friends with Maciej Lampe (what a great pick he was).  He has been playing with some euro league team for the lat 3 years but there is no tape on him and scouts have not seen him play because he never got in the game!!!  The best guy on his team was Scoonie Penn, and this slob couldn’t get off the bench.  So apparently he came over here to work at some strength clinic that helped NENE a couple years ago, and now he put on 20 pounds so he is a star, basically he is a foreign guy who nobody has seen who is 19 and has a “Nowitzki” game.  If he had a “Nowitzki” game he would have been playing over guys like Scoonie Penn.  	This ridiculous article prompted me to do some serious research over the last 3 NBA drafts and check out just who are the right guys to pick and how if you are slotted as a second round pick you should choose another line of work.  This is going to be a tremendous amount of numbers so be sure and get your slide rule out and follow along.   The 2001 draft where Kwame Brown was the #1 pick there were 20 Early Entry (EE) 6 Foreigners (F) and 5 High Schoolers (HS) picked, that is a whopping 58% of the guys drafted. Of those 32 drafted 11 are longer in the league and the ones that are in the league are mediocre at best.  In that group the 3 foreign guys drafted in the first round have had the most impact, scoring 11.6ppg and starting 35 games a year, which is still not that good. Eight of the EE guys are not even in the league anymore and the 2 second round foreign guys are nowhere to be found.  The EE guys in the 1st round averaged 9.3ppg over three seasons, and the second round guys 6.4ppg in a big 26 games a year. Never mind the high school kids, the one second round guy is not in the league and the four 1st round guys are starting 28 games a year and scoring a pultry 6.9ppg.  So basically those guys in that draft where not worth drafting, they have had three years and there impact has been minimal, but as the number of drafted gets higher the numbers get worse.  Now we come to the Yao draft of 2002, which I call the Early Entry draft.  This one was unbelievable 39 of the draftees were EE, F or HS which is 67%, that is a staggering number. There were 24 EE’s and 5 of those have already disappeared, 14 F’s and 8 of those (all second rounders) are not in the league and one high school guy, Amare Stoudamire  who has done well for himself.  There were 15 EE’s taken in the first round and through two seasons the one with the highest ppg. is Caron Butler at 12.5ppg.  (This next sentence said in a Hubie Brown to Dick Stockton TNT analyst voice) The average for these young men is 6.1ppg in 17.8mpg. As for the foreigners there were 6 first round guys who are dominating the league with 7.9ppg in an average of 37 starts a season.  However, Yao and NENE have both been solid players, so if you do not get obsessed with taking every foreign talent or high school kid out there you can have a some decent picks, as you see with the amount of EE guys the more you pick the more chance there is for failure, but last year GM”S were overrun with stupidity and drafted ridiculously bad people.  In 2003 we all know there were some marvelous young talents out there and a few of them have done very well for themselves and still the numbers are way down.  The numbers breakdown this way 11 EE’s, 19 F’s and 5 HS’s for a grand total of 34 which is 57% of the draftees.  Out of those 34 does anyone know how many averaged double digit points? 4, that’s it 4, LeBron, Carmelo, Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade.  Even with LeBron’s lofty numbers if you average him in with the other HS’s they drag him down like a D in psychology 101.  The HS’s averaged 11.8mpg and 6.2ppg while playing in a measly average of 28 games this season.  There were 19 F’s drafted and there superstar was the great Mickael Pietrus who scored 5.3ppg on the 37 win Warriors.  Almost half of those foreign guys have yet to make an NBA roster for one reason or another, 9 of the 19 are nowhere to be found and the ones that are here have played in and average of 50 games, started an average of 9 of those games and scored a whopping 4.2ppg.  Those are just superb numbers, now I see why coach’s get fired every 6 minutes in the NBA, how about giving them something to work with.  Orlando used a second round pick on Zaur Pachulia from Georgia, not the University the country, the Atlanta Hawks who recently fired there coach used a first round pick on soon to be perennial MVP candidate Boris Diaw, who played 25mpg and scored 4.5ppg.  Here are some proven 4 year college guys picked after Mr. Diaw, Josh Howard who scored 8.5ppg, Kyle Korver who scored 4.5ppg in only 11mpg, and Steve Blake who averaged 6ppg in 18mpg.  But apparently it is Terry Stotts fault that the Hawks are no good.  Now for the Utah Jazz, who left the cupboard pretty dry for Mr. Sloan, they drafted Aleksander Pavlovic (14.5mpg 4.8ppg) and Maurice Williams (13.5mpg 5ppg) and he almost made the playoffs in the Western Conference, he should be given a lifetime contract.    So what is my whole point in this incoherent rambling nonsense?  I have no point, just that the GM’s should be held accountable sometimes.  It seems to me that when teams do poorly they escape most of the blame.  When you think about the fact that every Eastern Conference team switched coach’s in the last 15 months, yet the GM’s have drafted such superstars as Zoran Planicic, Darko Milicic, Carlos Delfino, Dajuan Wagner, Jared Jeffries, Marcus Haislip, Jiri Welsch, Nenad Krstic, DeSagana Diop, Joe Forte, and Samuel Dalembert over the past three seasons.  I demand my NBA back and I do not want to see Damir Omerhodzic, Cleiton Sebastiao, or the ever popular Pavel Polkodzine drafted in any round.

      Recently the agent for Kobe Bryant announced that his client will be unavailable to play in the 2004 Summer Olympics.  Kevin Garnett said that he will not play this summer either. These defections of probably the two best basketball players on the planet could seriously affect the “Dream Teams” chance of winning Olympic Gold.  By the way can we stop using the phrase “Dream Team?”  My “Dream Team” has Wilt, Jordan, Magic, Larry, Kareem, and Oscar all playing in heaven on the same team.  I truly feel that if the NBA and USA Basketball got together and really sent our 12 best players over to Greece we would easily walk away with gold.  I understand that the Europeans, Asians, and Australians have made great strides in the game of basketball.  In fact some of the best players in the league hail from other continents, like Peja Stojakovic, Yao Ming, and Dirk Nowitzki.  Yet I still believe America has the greatest supply of talent.  The Foreign teams can run out a comparable starting five to the Americans, but the overall depth would lead the USA to victory.  The overall collection of talent in the NBA is comprised of mostly American born players.  Over the last two seasons the All-NBA teams have been comprised of 25 US born players, one Canadian, one German, one Chinese, and one Serbian.  This shows that even the great foreign talent is spread out all over the world.  I just want the best US Team to go out there and see how well they can play.  When I talk about the best team we can put out there, I am not talking about Karl Malone, Mike Bibby, Richard Jefferson, and Ray Allen, who are all scheduled to compete this summer for the red whit and blue.  I am talking about the 12 best players in the league, and those players are; Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O’Neal, Jason Kidd, LeBron James, Jermaine O’Neal, Allen Iverson, Tracy McGrady, and Chris Webber.  The last two spots depend on your personal preference of guys like Paul Pierce, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Baron Davis, Stephon Marbury and Sam Cassell.  Give me that core group of ten players and I guarantee a gold medal winning team.  In fact give me those ten guys and throw in the two best college players in the land to reward them, Emeka Okafor and Jameer Nelson.    I am an American and I hate to lose.  Realistically I do not mind losing, as long as you go down with your best chance to win.  Your best chance in basketball is to run your best players out there and have them give it their all.  If you lose doing that than you shake the other guys hand and say great job.  I am sick of running third rate NBA ball players out there and losing and wondering why we lost.  I want a real “Dream Team” to be back out there in Athens come this August.

      I just finished watching Denzel Washington in one of his great roles as Coach Boone in Remember the Titans.  It got me to thinking about the great sports movies of all time and what attracts us to them.  Simple, drama is what engages us about sports and sports movies.  The drama of whether or not this is Phil Mickelson’s year for a major or can Kurt Russell’s boys beat the Soviets in Miracle.  Drama is real life and in order to survive in life we have to persevere, and in most sports movies there is a great deal of perseverance.  Coaches always talk about how sports mirror life and this is most evident in what sports stories make great movies.  The movies with the most perseverance and the best to watch are the ones that are based on true stories.  	Recently ESPN’s Page 2 compiled a list of the 20 greatest sports movies of all time.  Excluding the 4 comedies 9 of the other 16 are movies based on true stories.  Most people would have to agree that Rocky, Hoosiers, Raging Bull, and Eight Men Out are among the top sports movies of all time.  All of these movies portray the lessons we learn about life through sports.  Rocky was written by Sylvester Stallone when he was inspired by the real life tale of “The Bayonne Bleeder” Chuck Wepner who stood toe to toe with Muhammed Ali.  Carpe Diem, that is what Rocky is about, taking advantage of that once in lifetime opportunity.  Hoosiers lets us know that if we come together, as sports so often teaches us to do, great things can be achieved no matter what the obstacles.  These movies truly show us how sports are a great metaphor for life.  Life may have us down at some point but at anytime there is chance for redemption.    	As in all walks of life sports has it share of tragedy and tragic characters. Raging Bull shows us the self destructive nature that hides inside us all.  Robert DeNiro brilliantly plays the talented but self loathing Jake LaMotta.  The same passion and rage that drives him as a fighter also drives him to paranoia and his ultimate self destruction.  His life spirals out of control and he loses everything, his career, his family, and the admiration of his friends.  In Eight Men Out we are given a cautionary tale of how a quick fix can go terribly wrong.  The ballplayers knew that taking money from gamblers to lose games was wrong, but they saw no other way out of the situation their owner had put them in.  This is a reflex action that almost every one of us has had in life, where we do something we know is wrong yet we feel it is the only way to solve our current situation.  These dramatic films portray the tragedy that can befall anyone of us throughout life if we are not careful.  	The real life drama of sports engages us on a daily basis.  When these dramas are brought to the screen through movies we get to see the best and worst of the human spirit through the sports arena.  Watching Remember the Titans tonight made me realize what is good in sports and how it can teach us so much about life.  Yes some of the drama in these movies is made up, but the spirit of them is just the same.  We live for those moments in our lives when we have the opportunity to do something we thought may not be possible and sports brings us those moments routinely.  Hopefully the positive lessons that sports teaches us and our children can be carried over into our everyday lives.

      So I went and checked my fantasy baseball team and I am the worst team ever.  Now mind you I had the first pick in the draft, and study stats like my name was Tim Kurkjian before the draft, and this is what all that has yielded me:   Player                      Career Avg.

Sexson                          .272          .241       31 points Those are some great batting numbers, now pitching:   Player             Career ERA   Current ERA  Starts  W-L  R. Oswalt                2.92          2.90    7     2-1 (2 wins, thanks Houston big help) J. Peavy                 3.96          1.94   7      2-2 (What, 2 wins w/1.94??) J.

One would figure with all this useless time I could put together a winner, but alas I am destined to be a loser my entire life, which most of you were well aware of for sometime.

      I have only seen the trailer for the new Tom Hanks movie and it looks terrific, that guy is an amazing actor.  Speaking of actors what is anyones fascination with Vin Diesel or any project he does??  I mean he was even terrible in Saving Private Ryan, please stop casting him, please please please.  This week I watched a championship boxing match, a "big time" horsy race, an NBA Game 7, an NHL Game 7 and a Perfect Game.  The best thing for my money is still the hockey game.  Can someone please get Larry Bird a fucking seat, it is so annoying watching team GM's stand there and watch the game.  Get a suit or something, GEEZ!!  I know players complain a lot in sports, but Rasheed has brought it to a new level.  On every single whistle, if it is a foul on his team or the other, if it is a ball out of bounds or a timeout, and even if he isn't in the game he always has something to say to an official, and I know that not all the time it is negative but it just wears me out and must to the officials too.  Next time he says anything to an official he should be thrown out of the league.  Is anyone suprised by this guy who made that fast food movie? You mean if you eat McDonalds everyday for a month you will damage your internal organs and gain weight, wow thanks for that "groundbreaking" documentary.  If it weren't for great music I would not be able to get through any day of my life.  AND  The Texas Rangers are good, not because A-Rod left, but because John Hart is the GM (he only help build the Blue Jays as the Asst. GM and the Indians of the 90's) Grady Fuson (who was the scouting director who built the A's of the late 90's and 00's) and Buck Showalter who fostered the development of 2 World Series winning organizations (The Yankes & Diamondbacks).  This was an inevitable development, so please stop saying they are better of without A-Rod.  Peace & Love  KD

      As a straight male it pains me to admit it sometimes but my favorite new show on TV is the CBS Friday night drama Joan of Arcadia.  It stars the wonderful Joe Mantegna and the underrated Mary Steenbergen & newcomers Amber Tamblyn and Jason Ritter (son of the late John Ritter).  It is a show were Joan, a teenage outcast basically, is confronted by God and told to do things.  However, when God manifests himself he does so in various ways; sometimes as a student at her school, or a man walking his dog, or a waiter at a restaraunt.  Joan usually follows his advice, but in a good TV Drama way things do not always work out perfectly.    On top of confronting her new found faith in God, Joan is still a high school student, dealing with her first boyfriend and her mother and brother who are both in the school with her.  The oldest son (Jason Ritter) was a star athlete who was paralyzed in an auto accident and the father is a police detective dealing with his work problems.  All the characters are deep and their storylines very interesting.  Also the themes in the show do run from one episode to the next, so it is not just a one and done drama.  It moves along with very believable problems that confront today's teens and today's families, all while intertwining the lost faith in God that seems to have swept today's society.  The family in the show is has no confirmed religious conviction, not even christian, but probably not Jewish.  In the season finale tonite Joan's mother dreamt that God was talking to her, while Joan sick in a hospital confronted God during medicaly induced hallucinations asking wether or not he was real.  Also the Father had his own leaps of faith in this episode.  It was nice to see how the other characters dealt with God and how he comes into our lives.  It is a very powerful drama which can help teach anyone some thoughts about God and his "plan" for us all.    I do not know where the show came from, but I am certainly happy it is on.  I have not really been hooked into regualr viewing of a TV show since That 70's Show premeired in 1999.  This show seems to have a staying power and I recommend to anyone regardless of your thoughts on God.  By no means does it preach or be pushy with its religious overtones.  It is just a quality show with quality writing and I enjoy it very much.

      Well it seems as if Kobe Bryant may have to make one of his mad dash's from a Colorado court room to the Staples Center on the day of game 4 of the Western Conference finals.  There has been a debate on how we should take what he has been able to accomplish on the court during this difficult year for him.  Here is how we should take it,  Athletically  it is an incredible achievment.  Ask any high level athlete about their preperation on a gameday and they will tell you that the routine they go through leading up to the game is very important.  Our bodies are made up of chemicals and an athlete has to have a balance in his body with those chemicals and he does that by keeping a routine with his training, nutrition, and rest which for Kobe has been all thrown to sorts because of his pre-trial hearings.  Now all that being said, yes he has brought all this upon himself, he was in the room that night and has onlt himself to blame for putting himself in that situiation.  I am in no way absolving him of this crime or his obligation to be in court for or the pre trial hearings.  I hope that he is cleared of these charges (because I want to see him play for another 10 years) but I feel that no matter what happens there is always that backlash that ahtletes got away with crimes because they are rich and famous.  Basically OJ has screwed every other athlete who ever goes on trial.  Prince?  Does anyone get him?  I have totally missed the boat on this guy my whole life.  I have never understood what the fascination with this guy is.  His music is usually annoying, he is the strangest dude on the planet, and how women find him sexy is beyond me.  I was listening to his new song today, and of course Prince fans are all wet over his new song and new album, but I though to myself that sounds an awful lot like Jamiriqui.  If this current cong had been sung by Jamiriqui it would never be played on radio.  Because these whacko Prince fans love him so much he has basically been able to release anyting over the last 15 years and they will all tell you it is the greatest music ever.  Just never got him, don't think I ever will, I'll be in the corner listening to some Bob Dylan if you need me, truly the best musician ever born in Minnesota.  Does anyone care about this ridiculous track scandal?  No that is the answer, some chick said she was on the dope and that is why she is fast now she is gonna turn other people in.  It is track nobody cares, not in this country.  Please spare me all the bull and stop wasting time on my sportscenter and my news with this crap.  Can we get rid of the Sacramento Kings, and Chris Webber and Doug Chrisites wife.  They are done, it has been about eight years now they were supposed to have the best team and they always lose.  They also have a million excuses, Bobby Jackson didn't play, Webber wasn't 100% yada yada yada.  Do you remember the last time Chris Webber won anything??  It was back in 1991 (in high school) before most of you had kissed your first girl (or boy). Rick Adelman did this same thing with the Blazers in the early 90's had all the players and every reason to win, and didn't.  Please spare me the Kings trade all the players, fire their coach, and kill the Maloof brothers.  Remember that July 1st deadline to turn over power in Iraq, yeah you can wave that thing bye bye.  What the hell is Memorial Day, and why I am forced to go do something that weekend?  Just another excuse for the News to use the word tradgedy when some idiot gets tanked and runs over a dude changing his tire while his family is sitting in the car.   Why did everyone start drinking all this wine all of a sudden, I cannot go to the bathroom without someone talking about a Pinot or Grigio or red or white, this came in with th coffee house craze, why can terrorists target these places and "motor sports" events?

      In the sports industry we use the word great too frequently.  It seems to me that we annoint people as stars and great players a little too soon.  Many people thought this was true about Kevin Garnett that he was not truly a great player because his team had no really done well in the playoffs.  I was not one of these people, I have always thought he was great because he has helped changed the game.  He has helped usher in the new breed of player, tall and athletic with the ball skills of a guard and the footwork of a big man.  For 9 years he has ruled supreme in the state of Minnesota and now he has taken over the league.  He started his quest to take over the league this offseason when he demanded that the Wolves get him some players so he could compete against the rest of the western conference.  The Wolves obliged and he responded not by relying on those players but by having the best season of his career, winning the MVP and assuring his team home court throughout the Western Conference playoffs.  Last night he got Game 7 on his court in front of his fans on his 28th birthday.  Well KG, The Kid, The Big Ticket, The Franchise, show me what you've got!  And show me and everyone else is exactly what he did.  I am sure you have read the statline but here it is on more time 34 pts. 21 rbds. 5 blks. and 4 stls.    But you must look beyond and behind some of those numbers to measure his greatness.  In the 4th quarter with the Sacremento Kings fighting hard Garnett scored 13 straight points.  In those 13 points he caught numerous bad passes from teammates and finished plays at the basket with other players draped all over him.  And finally to end that run of points he drilled a 3 with the shot clock winding down to electrify the crowd and his teammates.  In the fourth quarter he had 6 rebounds, 3 blocked shots and a huge steal with :42 seconds remaining which forced the Kings to foul to extend the game.  It is the little things he does, like always picking his teammaters up off the floor, the focus he has at the free throw line, the playing point guard for almost 4 minutes in the fourth quarter when starter Sam Cassell rested a sore back.  A sore back, Garnett should be the one resting his sore back for carrying this team. Not once in the second half did you see him look at Coach Flip Saunders and ask for a breather, he didn't need it, great players don't need a breather they need to win the game.  Garnett has stamped his place in NBA lore, you will watch this game on ESPN Classic years from now, and they will not call it Game 7 they will call it the Garnett Game.  The media the fans everyones said the pressure was on him, he is the MVP he has to lead his team to victory in a game like this.  Well Garnett has finally silenced all his critics, they have nothing to say anymore.  He will now take on the Lakers in the Western Finals and by no means will I count him out.  This series may come down to which great player wants it more, Kevin Garnett or Kobe Bryant.

      Okay this is something we have to get right to the point on.   Anna Kournikova is hot, for a professional athlete, no more.   In fact I don't event think she is the hotteste athlete, I think Jenny Finch, Heather Mitts, and Sue Bird are all hotter.  But my overall point is when you stack Anna up against other athletes she stands out as someone who is worth looking at.  As far as stacking her up against models, actress's and singers and other famous people who are hired for being hot I believe she does not measure up.  I am just sick and tired of everyone fawning all over Anna everytime she does anything.  God forbid you mention her name around people, they start talking about divorcing their wives for the chance to date Anna.  I see hotter women all the time on TV whom I would much rather cut off an arm for over Anna.  Had she not been a Tennis player she would have certainly not been famous, she might have landed a modeling deal at some point, but she would not be the international superstar that she is today.  Just to let you know where I actually stand on this issue here is a list of few women (most of whom made a name simply because they are hot, though a few have some talent)whom I would much rather have carnal knowledge of and for a price:  Eva Mendes, Jennifer Garner, Alyssa Mialno, Halle Berry, Jenna Jameson, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Love-Hewitt, Brooke Burke, Molly Sims, Tyra Banks, Demi Moore, Jillian Barberie, Leanne Tweeden, Reese Witherspoon, Rebecca Romijn, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson, Elisha Cuthbert, Britney Spears, Jamie Lynn-DisCala, Jaime Pressley, Natalie Portman, Jennifer Biel, Kelly Ripa, Kristanna Loken, Denise Richards, Katie Holmes, Carmen Electra, Salma Hayek, and Jessica Alba just to name few.    So please spare me all the Anna is so freaking hot talk, just give it up already!!!

      "By busing a white or black child two hours or forcing them to sit next to each other at a desk, you may end up with a racially mixed school, but there are tremendous differences in educational results. Inner-city children operate at a disadvantage regardless of their race or ethnicity. They live with the disadvantages brought on by poverty. The inequities today are really socioeconomic and not race or ethnicity."  "It is important that kids, especially middle-class white kids, grow up in schools that reflect the multiracial aspect of the 21st Century. One of the first things you learn in integrated schools is tolerance, understanding, comfort and familiarity."   Both of the above statements are true, yet they come from opposing viewpoints.  It has been fifty years since the Supreme Court presided over Brown vs The Topeka Kansas School Board and so much has not changed.  I have read a few articles today about this anniversary, most of them fluffy about how we all hold hands and sing kumbaya now that we have integrated schools but the fact remains we are still segregated.  How far have we come since the civil rights movement, and is there a need for more legislation and more of an effort to combat racism in this country.  Over that past 5 years I have lived in an area of the world that is still widely segregated and a great deal of racism exist out in the open.  This is a stark contrast to where I grew up.  I went to what would be considered a melting pot high school in a suburban middle class town.  And believe me when I say it was crammed down our throats at every turn, that we were the lucky ones because of where we lived and who we went to school with.  As a youngster I did not fully understand it, but now as an adult I feel it was the most important thing I learned as a youngster.    But was my education more important than someone who went to an all white school in the south?  What I can tell you is they know more about the civil war than I do that is for sure.  Decisions like Brown vs The Board of Education do not always have the affect they intended.  Down in the south as more black students were bussed into white school the whites simply sent their children to private schools or moved out of the area.  Many of the white schools that were to be integrated have now been swung back from integrated in the 70's to all black now.  So has this court ruling worked, or are we back to sperate but equal?  Was the 1896 ruling of Plessy vs Ferguson what we wanted all along, saying seperate but equal did not violate the constitution?    These questions can only be answered by how we Americans treat each other on a day to day basis.  What is the difference in segregating schools or telling gay people they can't get married?  We are fighting a war in Iraq were we disposed the Baath Party who mistreated the Shiites and other ethnic groups, no different the pre 1950's America.  We still live in a country were I typed in Ku Klux Klan and got 316,000 web pages in .12 seconds.  Basically we have to change how we treat each other and how we feel, and that does start with educating youngsters.  If you believe in God you are taught two simple things, treat others as you want to be treated and that God created all of us in his image, that means everyone!!  Now if you don't believe in God then what is your basis for believing that one kind of people (black or white, tall or short, straight or gay, fat or thin, man or women) is inherently better or worse than another group?  Oh thats right you don't have one.  So we must continue to fight these types of segregation and racism wherever they exist in this country, especially in our schools so we can try and change the future.  I hope 50 years from now we do not even need to have these types of discussions.

      Do you ever get down on your knees and thank God you know me and have access to my dementia?   George Constanza in "Seinfeld"   Don't say a word to me, Sidney, don't say a fucking word to me. I'll get up and I'll bury this telephone in your head.   Jimmy Serano in "Midnight Run"   What I don't get is... when you owe a booky a lot of money, and, he, say, blows off one of your toes, you still owe him the money.  Dr. Farthing in "Dirty Work"   Christ. Seven years of college down the drain. Might as well join the fucking Peace Corps.  John Blutarsky in "Animal House"   Oh. Do you have the Beatles White Album? Never mind, just bring me a cup of hot fat. And the head of Alfredo Garcia.   Irwin M. Fletcher in "Fletch"   Oh boy, it looks like it's suicide again for me.  Moe Syszlak in "The Simpsons"   This is the kind of place God would go to if He had to stop doing blow.  Peter Griffin in "The Family Guy"   You guys have it real easy. I never had it like this where I grew up. But I send my kids here because the fact is you go to one of the best schools in the country: Rushmore. Now, for some of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich and your going to stay rich. But here's my advice to the rest of you: Take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs and take them down. Just remember, they can buy anything but they can't buy backbone. Don't let them forget it. Thank you.   Herman J. Blume in "Rushmore"

      What ever happened to the Flat top hair style, man that thing was bad ass.  I love watching the show Cheers, there really isn't one thing I dislike about it, I always laugh.  There was a horsy race today, and the horsy everyone wanted to win won, to quote the great Derrick Coleman "Whoopty Damn Doo!"  Got the new FHM in the mail today, truly the female breast is a wonderful thing, espcially the ones attached to Brooke Burke.  A teacher in California showed the be-heading of the young american in Iraq to middle school students, are you serious, this teacher should have his balls cut off.  AND  In one week, Saturday Night Live the Best of Christpher Walken, I cannot wait.

      Kevin Garnett plays 100% on every play no matter what the score or situation.  He is the hardest working player I have seen since Larry Bird.  He is required to score all their points, get all their rebounds and get most of their assists.  He is totally spent right now and he couldn't get a foul call without an act of congress.  He gets hammered all the time and he rarely complains and he never brings up any excuses after the game about anything.  How can you not love this guy.  I have watched a great number of games that involve Latrell Sprewell and I can never remember him getting a technical foul or continuing arguments with players or officials during a game.  Yes he did strangle PJ Carlisemo but he is an ass, however his reputation as a thug or a bad person seems to be blown way out of proportion.  Speaking of Techs how cool were the refs tonite just handing out Techinical fouls to people all the time.  I love Jack Neis, he must have given 40 techs last night.  To me they cannot call enough techs on these idiots for running their yaps.  Again I have wathced a lot of Laker games over the past 3 seasons and I honestly have never seen Slava Medvadenko hit a shot from anywhere on the court.  This guy should be thrown out of the league for being so terrible.  And while we are on the subject of terrible can someone please send Bryon Russell, Horace Grant, Rick Fox and Brian Shaw to please go and get jobs or something.  If I see Horace Grant give Derrick Fisher one more brother hug I am gonna kill somebody, and since I have no friends that somebody will probably be myself.  Over the past two nights I have watched teams who were losing and having trouble guarding the other team attempt to go to zone, and you know what happened?  The other team scored even more easily.  There is a reason why you don't see NBA teams play zone, it doesn't work.  How about you man up, move your fucking feet, and box somebody out!!!   I hope kids who are watching these games see how players are successful.  They play hard, go to the offensive & defensive glass, they cut without the basketball toward the basket and they share the basketball, it is not a difficult game at all.  AND  Lastly, I want all you people to read this carefully, Kobe Bean Bryant is a better basketball player than Michael Jeffrey Jordan.  I will say it again for those who are hard of reading, Kobe is better than Michael.  I don't care that he raped anybody, I really don't, I care that he has more basketball talent than Michaeal Jordan.  However, we don't all love him like we were all ordered to love Michael.  Had Jordan hit that reverse lay up with Michael Olowakandi draped all over him people would call it the greatest play they have ever seen, but Kobe does it and it is looked at as routine, what does that tell you. Again Kobe is better than Jordan!!!!!!

      It is springtime, love is in the air, people are enjoying the beautiful weather, and I am locked in my room living all things NBA.  Yes I know this is some life I lead, but hey at least I stay out of trouble.  So today we are handing the Lakers the Western Conference Title, we now know the Magic officially have the first pic, and the Pacers/Pistons series is  GREAT BASKETBALL!!!!   First thing, I do want to see are some rule changes in the league, nothing to fancy just some simple changes.  When a player is shooting a free throw nobody is allowed to touch the ball except the referee, I am so sick of guys jumping in the lane and touching the ball.  If you touch the ball you are thrown out of the league.  And after a call, any call, you have only five seconds to voice any protest to the ref.  We will have a midget with a stop watch keeping rocket up yotime, if you go over the alotted time the midget fires a rocket up your ass.  I think that would end these two awful parts of the game.  Now to the Draft Lottery, what the hell is the point of this thing?  So we have all these idiots in a room representing their respecetive teams.  The best part of this is  Chris Bosh sitting there staring at Diana Taurasi and thinking about how hard he is gonna drill her in a bathroom in the NBA headquarters only moments after this thing is over.  After all was said and done the Bulls and Clippers traded pics, thats it.  Every other team picks in the same order they finished.  Thank god we have a made for TV event for this.  Lottery, every team gets one ball except for the last place team they get 5 balls, that's it that's the list!!  That would be a fucking lottery people.  Pat Williams was pumping his fist and then realized he doesn't get Shaq, he gets Emeka Okafor, Dwight Howard, or Luol Deng.  Why would anyone want this #1 pick, I would trade it for a naked picture of Mo Vaughn in the shower personally.  The Lake show won their first home game so now they appearently have already won the NBA Championship.  I still believe the Wolves have a chance in this series.  Remember for Game 4 we have the Kobe court room drama and plus the Wolves are a good team.  And finally we get to the Pacers and Pistons.  Normally in a series like this I would want both teams to die in a fiery inferno before the game, but I do have money riding on the Pacers.  This series has been tremendous so far, but most people probably haven't watched more than 5 seconds of any of the games.  All they do is look at the score and say, "oh these must be terrrible games, look at the score."  Had you taken the time to see the effort being put forth by all of the players you would be floored.  They go at each other just like old time basketball; the push & shove, get into the faces of their opponents, challenge their teammates to rise to the occasion, and they make big time shots.  This series is introducing fans to some budding superstars, Jermaine O'neal and Richard Hamilton especially, but of course old people cannot like them cause the have braids so they are automatically bad people.  Both these guys play balls out every second they are out on the floor.  They do whatever it takes for their teams to win and it is a pleasure to watch them.  I hope that the league begins to market these young players and I hope that fans will take hold of their talents and efforts and grow to respect them, you can call these guys "throwback players" or whatever you want.  They give it their best and that is why there teams are still alive in the playoffs and it is a joy to watch these playoffs.    For my dollar the NBA playoffs this season are matching the intensity and joy of last years baseball playoffs. I hope that people are watching and enjoying these games as much as I am.

      For some reason I always pain myself and pay some attention to the current season of The Real World.  I am not really gonna get to much into the problems with the title itself or the whole "reality TV" craze in this country.  I will say that my real world revolves around paying bills, watching some TV, and going to work without the people I live with.  Those are some fundamental problems I have with the show.  All that aside a friend of mine named Jeremy told me to pay attention to this years version because his friend was on the show and she had told him about the great time she had, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So I have decided to watch and it is no different than any other season, I will break down the whole show for you:  Character 1:  Some guy, he is cute guy and the girls love hime, but he has a serious girlfriend back home.  He is everybody in the houses friend, which means to me you cannot trust this person.  He is the guy who plays peacemaker all the time during the fights.  In a fight you have to take a side pal, to quote Mr. Myagi "Walk on left side of road, SAFE, walk on right side of road, SAFE, walk in middle of road get squish like grape." I hate this person.  Character 2:  The guy who is a dick and nobody seems to like, although they keep giving him chances.  However, this person is usually disliked for the worng reasons, usually he has an opinion on something or a conviction about his beliefs and he always stays true to himself.  While you can dislike this persons views, in the end more often than not this person will be the one who is most often successful in life, not just rehashing his reality TV career by being on real world/road rules challenge or inferno or whatever.  Character 3:  The whore.  This is the girl who you can pick out immediately and label her the slut.  She knows she is one, and she knows that everyone in the house knows she is and her total whoreness always gets in the way of everything and ruins everyones time there.  Character 4: The wananbe whore.  This is the girl, who is afraid of revealing to much herself, cause people don't know the real her or whatever.  She really wants to be the whore, but she isn't.  This one usually winds up getting with the asshole guy first and then settling with Mr. Peacemaker.  Character 5:  The I am not a whore, whore.  This is the really annoying girl.  At first the girl who seems cool and you would love to hang out with and maybe even date and then her whoreness, but unwillingness to embrace her slutty ways like character 3, take over the entire show and causes every ounce of drama in the show.  She usually wants to nail the Peacemaker when they first get there but then winds of meeting some guy at a bar while during the show, his name could be Chad or Chip or something like that and their relationship plays out the run of the show  Character 6:  The other person, you watch the show about 2 years from now on a Real World marathon weekend and go oh yeah that guy/girl was on the show.  Please stop it with this nonesense, at it's core it is a terrific idea for a show but it has gone horribly wrong.  It is kind of like Marxism, on paper it is a solid plan but stuck in the wrong peoples hands it leads to ultimate failure and death.

      So we are fast approaching one of my truly favorite holidays in America, the ever popular Memorial Day.  Like true Americans we spend this holiday buying things, sunscreen, gas, towels, new bathing suites, beer, and food so we can get to the beach or one of the seven BBQ's (yes southerners & black people I mean cookout) we have to go to.  And why do we do all this, of course so the terrorists dont't win.  Can we still use this line anymore?  Or have we beaten the terrorist?  Anyway, does anyone know anything about Memorial Day, no you don't so stop pretending you do.  The origins of Memorial Day are somewhat disputed, but the spirit is the same.  Basically after the Civl War towns across the country wanted a way to honor the local men who had given  their (TAKE THAT JENN-FER)  lives in battle.  It does not have to do with honoring veterans which is a common misconception, that is Veterans day.  servThis is a way to Memorialize those who served valiantly and died for their country.  In these towns the citizens would fly all flags at half staff, decorate their houses with evergreen boughs & mourning streamers, and then the townspeople would march to the local cemetary decorate the graves of fallen soldiers and then memorialize them with speeches and services by Clergy and Military leaders.  So my suggestion to all of you is to do something this Memorial Day and here is what I suggest.  Take some time out of your incredibly busy consumer weekend find the name of a local soldier who passed away in some war go to a local cemetary and say a memorial prayer for them.  Maybe you have someone in your family who you would like to memorialize, feel free to do that.  If you need a suggestion on what to say here is the Euology for a Veteran:  Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there, I do not sleep.   I am a thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glints on snow.   I am the sunlight on ripened grain. I am the Gentle autumn rain.   When you awaken in the mornings hush, I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight, I am the soft stars that shine at night.   Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there, I did not die.   -Author Unknown    Peace & Love   KD

      So now Friends has ended and I have had time to recover.  Thank god Rachel and Ross got back together, I have no idea what I would have done with myself had Rachel stayed on the plane to Paris.  Well anyway, I was sitting by the pool today and heard some fat ladies talking about Friends and how great a show it was, and then also my roomates fuck toy (some of you may commonly refer to her as a "girlfriend") was trying to tell us that this was unequivicably the #1 sitcom of all time.  I could not have disagreed with her more.  When using the word great in TV sitcom land I can only refer to a few shows who were either groundbreaking, entertaining to the masses not a specific dempgraphic, and shows that had brilliant writing.  These shows are; Cheers, The Honeymooners, I Love Lucy, Cosby, MASH, Seinfeld, and All in the Family.  Now while I do not enjoy all of these shows they all have their place in sitcom history for many different reasons, reasons which Friends cannot possibly contend with.  Cheers may well have been the most well written comedy show of all time.  The characters were flawless and their daily interaction were right on.  This show was on when I was in grade schoo-high school and while I had never been to a bar it made me laugh everytime it was on. There was nothing fony about this show, it was real people sitting around a bar and making everyone laugh.  This show endured character changes to one of the main characters and a brilliant secondary character and their replacements may have been better, that goes to show you how well written the show was.  Seinfeld, while not a personal favorite, is the most quotable show of all time.  No soup for you, Serenity Now, Hello Newman, Shrinkage, Master of my Domain, Bob Saccomano, The Assman, A FESTIVUS FOR THE REST-OF-US, the Manzere all of these references make you laugh in some way.  There will never be a more clever show on Television.  MASH was grounbreaking in so many ways.  It is the only sitcom based on an historical event.  It was the most dramatic sitcom of all time and it was nominated for more awards then any show ever.  It used brutal language and showed graphic images to get it's point across, and it to endured character turnover and may have came out with better characters in the end.  And if it is writing you want you need only watch 2 episodes the final one and the episode where Hawkeye is trapped in a hut with a Korean family that speaks no english, the show is a 23 minute monologue by Alan Alda, simply brilliant.  Cosby was the most positive portrayal of a black family in TV history.  Until that time black families were slapstick comedy like Good Times, The Jeffersons, and Sanford & Son.  Bill Cosby broke down barriers by saying black families could be well to do and have a good structured family life.  And there willingness to introduce black culture and history on the show through the use of guest stars is still unmatched to this day.  All in the Family and I love Lucy were probably the two most groundbreaking comedies of all time.  Lucy challeneged the establishment by having a lead female character and by pushing the boundaries of what could be said on television. Archie Bunker did the same some 20 years later.  His total biggotry and racism was unbelievable to see on television yet it represented a segment of society.  These two show are timeless classics.  The Honeymooners is without a doubt the best Television show of all time.  "To the moon Alice" and "Baby your the greatest" are the two best lines in TV history.  This show was basically 3 people, one room and one camera and thats it.  No fancy editing and camerawork, just pure comedy genius with the orginal comic duo of Ralph Cramden and Ed Norton.  If there is a better straight man/funny man combo out there I have not seen it.  This show is the basis for all sitcoms ever, it was the first and still is the best.  This show has truly stood the test of time.  Friends, while a worthy show and a funny show has none of these qualities.  It had a strong core audience and that core audience is the number 1 draw for advertisers, but it did nothing groundbreaking and does not appeal to a mass audience.  For sports fans, Friends is the Frank Thomas of TV.  Yeah it'll get in the Hall of Fame cause it has all the nice numbers but when you go to the banquet are you there to get Friends (Frank Thomas) autograph or are you there to get Barry Bonds or Willie Mays autograph?  I think we all know the answer to that.  Peace & Love  KD

      What would posses anyone to have children?  I have pondered this question for quite some time and I cannot come up with a good reason.  First of all most people who do have children shouldn't be allowed to roam free on this planet never mind procreate.  I think that there should definately be laws governing who should have children and if these policies are violated, simple solution, death to the kids.  Really when you think about it if you kill a baby before his life really gets going he is not missing anything.    I have come to this conclusion after going to the movies this weekend and being overrun by a herd of children.  The whole time during the film the kids were talking not paying any attention, always having to go to the bathroom, or need more popcorn.  These parents were at the beck and call of their children. Imagine if you had a dog too, then your life is dedicated entirely to walking your dog, feeding your kids, wiping their asses, telling them they can't touch this, or clean your room.  I have trouble wiping my own ass and clening my onw room, so I need to get other people and more rooms to have them clean.  Who started this trend, most animals in the animal kingdom handle it this way, once the kids are done nursing they basically are on their own.  No wiping there ass or cleaning their rooms.  So I say don't have children.  The more we have the more can commit crimes and drain the economy and basically contribute nothing to society.  Great more kids to watch terrible re-runs of Friends, YIPPEEE!!!!

      Sorry folks, nothing has really pissed me off lately, although some things are coming round the bend.  I have been busy, no not really that is just a lame line losers like to use to indicate that they have been playing with their didlo to much.  So I will leave you with a few quickies to ponder, while I wait for someone or something to make me angry.  Is it a requirement that if you are a baseball manager you have to wear a watch?  Check out a game sometime, Joe Torre or Tony LaRussa will have a watch on, for what?  Why is it that in a scary movie if someone has a foreign accent they are a scary person, and most times dead people who rise from the dead always have foreign accents.  How can I drive 10 miles over the speed limit for 11 straight hours and never even be in fear of being pulled over?  In fact the whole time I was in the car I only saw 2 people pulled over on a traffic stop.  Well I cannot wait for the NBA finals to start on sunday, Pacers v T-Wolves, what a series it should be.  Okay so I was wrong, who is keeping count.  I did say to anyine who was listening earlier this year that the Padres would win the NL West, so I am hanging my hat on that!!!

      Okay okay, sorry folks again the "wedding vacation" took alot out of me, but I will be back now writing regularly for about 2 weeks, then another week long furlow.  Today we shall talk about Mr. Phil Jackson, as Jeff Van Gundy once referred to him "Big Chief Triangle."  Now is the time were Mr. Jackson can make his mark on the game of basketball.  He has been on cruise control as an NBA head coach for over ten years.  Every year he has not won the championship people have had ready made excuses for him, Jordan was retired or Jordan just came back, when the Lakers didn't win it was because Shaq never got in shape.....yada yada yada.  Now he has no excuses, he has 4 hall of famers everyone is in shape and Kobe had maybe his best season ever, even while having to deal with the problems in his personal life.    He actual has to be a coach now, he cannot just sit around and do nothing and pass out books and hope everyone plays well.  He has 4 hall of famers, and he is supposed to be the man who can manage talent better than anyone else, so lets see you get at Big Chief.  It is time to put himself up there with the greats, because for me his titles alone don't do it.  He is going up against a hall of fame coach right now who has prepared his team very well.  The Pistons have a solid defensive game plan with helping on Kobe when he goes to the middle and not really doubling Shaq and completely shutting down Devean George, Derek Fisher and others.  Offensiveley they are playing various line-ups and explotiing every mismatch and what has Jackosn done to thwart any of this??  Oh yeah,  NOTHING .  They got lucky in game 2, for some reason Rasheed fouled Shaq & he hit a free throw, and then Kobe hit a huge shot.  Otherwise they have been outplayed and outcoached since the opening tip.    I sent out the same challenge to the Big Chief in the Spurs series and he responded by having a better gameplan to contain Ginobili and Parker.  Well here it is again Mr. Jackson, if you don't earn your stripes now I am afraid you are not an all time great.  Every human on the planet pikced you to win in 5-6 games and you are down 2-1.  Your team is openly questioning what their defensive gameplan is, so Philly Boy lets see what you got.

      Well it is summer time and sports have slowed down, and my other passion is beginning to pick up, the summer movie season.  I will not go see a lot of the Hollywood filth and trash that is out there.  However, I will choose movies that seems to have an engaging story, are well done technically, and have actors or ensembles that I enjoy.    This afternoon I pulled a double matinee feature.  I went to see Dodgeball and The Terminal.  I will first talk about Tom Hanks (be warned this will be a me sucking Tom Hanks dick rant).  Hanks is the best, it is that simple.  We all know about his award winning roles in Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, and Saving Private Ryan.  But try and think of some of his other roles, even some not as the lead and try to picture another actor pulling those roles off.  For example Jimmy Dugan in A League of Their Own, Carl Hanratty in Catch Me if you Can, Sheriff Woody in Toy Story, Allen Bauer in Splash, Chuck Noland in Cast Away and even those gay Meg Ryan Movies.  Nobody is as good as him, he can do it all, he can carry a movie all by his lonesome, he can make others better, all by himself he makes movie watching enjoyable.  He is totally believable in every movie, he is so good he is almost tangible. To me he is Wayne Gretzky, we always want Jordan, Ruth, Ali, Jim Brown, etc to be the greatest athlete of them all, but it is really Gretzky, who quietly dominated his sport like no man before or since, that is what Hanks does.    In the Terminal his comic timing is brilliant, his character stays true to himself throughout. And the movie, while at times a little predicatable and sappy, is great.  He pulls it off again, the only thing I can say is go see it, take a date it will be worth your while.  The movie does not dissappoint even the love story in it plays out well. (and nobody hates useless love storiy lines more than me)  As for Dodgeball, I would say wait for the rental.  It was funny, I mean it had some laugh out loud moments in it, and I only know this because I had a black man sittitng next to me and you know how they laugh (Martin you were there).  It was a short movie but worth watching, Ben Stillers character is despicable and Stephen Root (Office Space and News Radio) is his usual nerdy funny self.  So that is all for movies right now, I can say that I am awaiting the arrival of The Notebook due out in July and The Aviator (DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, directed by Sciorsesse) due out this winter.

       Names:      What the heck is up with middle names?  Why does anyone require one and where did they come from?  Seems to me they make very little sense.      What is up with adjusting names, like if your name is William and you are called Bill, why? Or people named Christopherwho are called Chris?  Fuck you my name is Kris yours is Christopher, stick with the names your parents gave you JERK!  I do not think I would have entered into the space program if the name of my shuttle was "The Challeneger."  I want to be on "The Achiever" or "The Champion."  Being on "The Challenger" is like being on "The Hope we can make it."  Do yourselves a favor, if you want to sort of be down with th reality craze watch "Last Comic Standing."  Very good show with very funny people, and that is how you are judged, you better be funny cause that is something you cannot fake.  AND   In this era of Day After Tommorrow, Chronicles of Riddick and Garfield, it is refreshing to see a movie that has an orginal script and some good original ideas.  This movie is "Saved!" starring the ever hot Mandy Moore, a very good Macauly Culkin and some other solid acting.  Go see it, yes it has to do with religion and stuff but it is far from preachy and approaches the matter in a very interesting way.

      I hate to agree with Dick Vitale and Steven A. Smith, but I am on their bandwagon.  I mean enough with these high school kids, foreigners and even some random college guys.    I believe the Bulls will still be very active in trading, rather than just having a host of young guys.  I liked what the Jazz did, Humphries and Snyder are both good pics, they have NBA ready bodies.  Why whould the Blazers pass up on Snyder, whom they said all along they would take?  Is Sebastian Telfair really any better than say Omar Cook was coming out of St. John's after his freshmen year?  For some reason I like what the Celtics did, maybe cause they got some college vets who you know are winners with Delonte West and Tony Allen.  Best singular fit for a team has to be Luke Jackson with the Cavaliers.  Watch out for this team, Paul Silas can coach and if they add a vet or two coming off the bench they can be extremely dangerous.  Boo to the Miami Heat for passing on Jameer Nelson, I do not care what the fucking excuse is.  Love Devin Harris to the Mavericks and do not like what the Atlanta Hawks have done.  Lastly on college guys being picked, why do these random college guys get picked like Araujo, David Harrison, Kevin Martin, and Jackson Vroman.  To me there seem to be more proven college guys out there like Andre Emmet, Matt Frejie, Timmy Bowers, Antonio Burks, Herve Lamizana, and Arthur Johnson.    I'll have more on this at a later time, I have some research to do on all this shit.

      Wow how exciting was last night.  All the trades and rumors, T-Mac now not going to Houston.  Unbelievable, I am officially the biggest loser in the world cause this shit excites me.    I believe Okafor is Orlando's guy tonite.  Howard will go #2, Igudala #3, and Devin Harris to the Clip's.  After that it is anyone's guess. The Mav's are still trying to get Shaq so that five pick may not be there's when it rolls around tonite.  I also believe the Chicago Bulls are going to make some noise.  They already have Crawford, Hinrich, Chandler, and Curry, what would adding to more unproven young guys do, except make you bad for a few more years.  Now a team with vet's could use on of those picks and one of those guys I just named, and the only one who is off limits for trade is probably Hinrich.  So look for the Bulls to be active this evening.  The Hawks have 2 top 20 picks, and somehow they will screw it up.  With their #6 pick they should take Deng, Luke Jackson, or Livingston (in that order) and they will probably all be there.  Then they can take a flyer on one of the high school kids named Smith, but they should gobble up Kirk Snyder from Nevada if he is still available.    The Celtics and Jazz each have 3 picks between 14-25.  In this years draft I think you can get the same level of talent at #10 and #25 so Utah and Boston are sitting pretty.    The Jazz are sold on Monya the Russian who is butt pals with Kirilenko and he can shoot, then with their other 2 look for any combo of Araujo from BYU, Kris Humphries, Pavel Pdokolzine, and Peter Ramos.  The need and want Big Guys.  The C's will draft Robert Swift with their first pick, then with their second all indications have them taking another high schooler and then one of the mystery foreigners, so they are in line to screw it up.  If you have 3 picks, you take one high school, on 3-4 year college guy and then take a flyer on your last pick.  Just like the Blazers are planning to do, take Snyder then Telfair and then one of the foreigners still available, like Khryapa or Ramos.  I think the Jazz and Blazers will do it right, we shall see how the Celtics do with it.  Now all these teams could be active in trading this evening.  Here are some players who may sneak into the back end of the 1st round and be put in a good situation.  Matt Freije possibly to the Kings or Spurs.  Andre Emmett the Spurs and Tony Allen to the Pacers or Spurs.  Proven college guys going to veteran teams where they can make a contribution early by coming off the bench.  And lastly a few lost guys in this draft.  At the high end Ben Gordon and Josh Childress I think will get picked early, but not to fill any specific need, rather just for the fact they are good and I would not be suprised to see them moved tonite in some of the wheeling and dealing.  Finally, Jameer Nelson, the Miami Heat are drooling over him falling to the #19 pick.  Could he look anymore like Tim Hardaway in a Heat uniform?  This would allow Stan Van Gundy to move Wade to the shooting guard and basically relieve Lamar Odom of any ball handling duties, my how much of a perfect fit would this be.  Can't wait for the draft folks.  I will be sitting on my couch watching the whole thing go down, feel free to call me to get instant analysis, or just wait for tommorrow's recap.

      Ok folks, lots to get off my chest, and a whole lotta chest it is. (This guy knows what I'm talking about)  First off, Yes Tiger Woods is in a slump. I will now tell you why, years ago when he first came up and he was taking the golf world by storm, he said repeatedly I am only playing to win The Majors.  You can look it up (I already did for you), he is shooting to take down Jack Nicklaus, and while he does already have 8 majors, it has been over 2 years since his last one.  He openly admits every time he plays and takes time off is to set him up in what he thinks is his best position to win a major.  He has never come back on Sunday to win one, he has always been tied or held the lead going into Sunday.  Lastly, don't give me thatr victim of his own success bullshit (he is a victim of his own words), other golfers have stepped up and even passed him by to become more consistant threats to win at the majors.   Alicia Keys, will somebody please kill this lady.  I happened upon a video by this whore this morning and I almost broke the TV.  First of all she is ok looking, she is not super hot, she has no cans and a tiny butt.  Secondly, we all know you can play the piano, it seems like she tries to prove that everytime she gives some kind of performance or video.  In this current video, she is on a NY City rooftop in the blistering cold and snow playing the piano, just to let you know she has some musical talent, and frankly I don't give a shit.  Speaking of overrated artits once crammed up are asses, whatever happened to Macy Gray, she was supposed to be the best female artist since Aretha and I know more Clay Aiken songs that Macy Gray tunes?  Aaahh the NBA draft is coming, and stay tuned!!! Thursday we will have the ever popular draft preview and then Friday the ridiculous draft recap.  Both of which are sure to launch me on a frenzy that may cause harm to those within 500 yards of me.  Mainly cause Pavel Polkodzine and Damir Omerhodzic are gonna get drafted.  But to quote my friend Dan (A Great Jew)  "NBA Class of 2003 Draft Championship Rings LeBron-0, Carmelo-0, Wade- 0, Darko-1."  And  Is there anything I dispise more than another ridiculous film by Michael Moore.  The Crusader for the American people.  We have now elevated this guy to a status that rivals that of our lord, all because he exposes the fact that politicians lie.  Oh my what a startling revelation, anyone who takes his film and word as gosple is just as guilty and ignorant as those who believe everything George Walker Bush tells you is the truth.  The idea is to do some thinking on your own, gather information, examine the data and form a conclusion.  As silly as it sounds that is basically "The Scientific Method" which we all learned about in sixth grade science class.  And again if you want change we live in a democratic society, so get of your atkins eating, american idol watching, prescripstion pill popping ass and go vote.

      Okay I have been locked away in a dormatory with a bunch of teenage girls at a basketball camp in the mountains of Virginia, and I have emerged a more sullen and bitter man.  We often had times at the camp to talk with the girls about their favorite Musical Artist, Movies, TV shows, etc.  And this got me thinking, all kids should die.  We had a girl at the camp named Rachel Leak, but she looked like a Kelly, so I called her Kelly Leak (referring to the great movie The Bad News Bears) of course she did not get it. I then asked if she had ever heard of the movie, and she said no, then asked if she knew who Walter Mathau was and she said no.  What is wrong with this people, are they only allowed to see Vin Diesel movies?  And don't give me that crap that all this shit happened before she was born, I have seen North by Northwest (1959) with Cary Grant, Some Like it Hot (1959) with Marilyn Monroe, On the Waterfront (1954) & Streetcar Named Desire (1951)with Marlon Brando, and Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) with William Holden.  Now we get to music which sickens me even more.  We got engaged in a discussion on our favortie musical artist an/or Group.  Now of course most of these kids could not narrow something like that down, because they had not watched MTV for 2-3 days so some 20 something no talent ass clown host had not told them which band they had to like today.  So one girl started talking about Dashboard Confessionals, which first of all sounds more like a Album Title, Song Title, or chessy rip off of the HBO orignal series Taxicab Confessionals, but I digress.  I agreed to listen to this CD if they listened to music of my choosing.  They agreed to listen to one Rap/Hip Hop and one say Rock artist.  So the Rap was easy, when people who have not been expose to true Rap/Hip Hop you simply pull out 1991's The Low End Theory by A Tribe Called Quest(the premium blend of Jazz beats and music with heavy lyrics), top to bottom one of the 4 or 5 most complete albums of all time.  Then we talked about whatelse I could give them and we agreed on some Bruce Springsteen, now while some of you on here may not like the fella, if you have ever heard his Nebraska album you would have to agree that lyrically it is one of the most powerful albums ever.  The pictures he paint are so vivid and the theme of the times (the deprssion laden middle class of the post inflation Jimmy Carter era) is so accurately portrayed.  So they listend, and then gaver the CD's back to me  and said that the thought Tribe sounded like the Spice Girls, and they didn't understand what Bruce was talking about.  Lyrically they were blown away by the music, mainly cause today's music ios all about a look and a video which is sucha  damned shame.    Oh and by the way the CD they gave me was 100% trash, just plain awful.  I will have more on this camp at a later time.

      I love the fact that I have some loyal readers, and even som assholes who just stumble upon this site.  Howeve, I have just one complaint, if you are going to post a response please identify yourself by name, not by some fucking swing bag nickname.  It takes like 5 seconds to sign up for an ID.  Dann Price was able to sign up for an ID and he is 3 of the 5 stupidest people I know, so it cannot be that difficult.    I enjoy all the responses and wish that I could get even more, that way I know someone besides Martin, Dan (A Great Jew), Dann Price and The Great DArby Wayne Rich are reading this shit.  Thank you and have a fat day!!!  Kris DeBlasio

      Another Friday Double Matinee today and I have plenty of news from my aisle side seat.  First let me talk about white women, whom I saw plenty of at the movie theatre.  I saw plenty of nice young ass and a few mothers that were worth throwing a bone too. But there is one inherent problem with white women, where the hell are their asses?  I am so disgusted with white women flat pancake asses, to quote Cliff Klavin, "What's up wit dat?"  A white women with an ass is kinda like a mule with a spinning wheel, nobody knows where she got it and danged if she knows how to use it.  Now to the movies, I saw Anchorman & King Arthur and it will be imperitave that you read both reviews, but first let me talk about the previews.  Again there are just way to many of these things and most of them are for movies that suck.  Catwomen, what could possibly be the appeal of this awful idea for a movie? And don't say Halle Berry in a cat suit, I have internet porn.  Then I saw these two previews twice, one is some sort of buddy film with Seth Green, Dax Sheppard (the guy from Punk'd), and Mathew Lillard (the comic relief in the first Scream) and they meet Burt Reynolds in the woods while they are on some crazy adventure, I could not tell you any sort of plot.  Then there is the diversity film, Harol & Kumar go to White Castle, again having a hard time trying to find a plot to this one, and every joke in it looks so unfunny I cannot imagine how anyone would make this film.  Put it this way, the trailer to Kangaroo Jack looked ten times as good as the trailer to this film.  Then a preview comes on where some government agency discovers a pyramid 2000 feet below the tundra surface of Antartica.  So they have to go investigate and they find all corps and stuff and it seems like maybe a cool scary type movie, but for some reason when they get down there Alien and Predator show up and battle each other and the humans, I mean this trailer went from something that peaked my interest to something that I have no idea why these 2 80's movie creatures where hiding in a pyramid underneath Antartica?  I am so confused on how someone can write this screenplay then prepare a treatment and present this to movie executives, and then the executives say, "sounds like a here is a billion dollars, make me a winner Johnny."   There are plenty of other bad ones coming out, but some that look good are The Bourne Supremecy (I liked the first one and I think Matt Damon is an excellent actor), a new Exorcist film which looks cool, The Village (which has a shot at being entertaining, even though it is a cross between Children of the Corn & Village of the Damned), and Collateral looks like it has a chance to be ok (I like Tom Cruise & Jamie Foxx)  Anchorman, let me be frank when I say this was an unadulterated piece of crap.  I love Will Ferrell and think he is hilarious, but he missed his mark on this movie.  I will give you what I think is the funniest part of the movie, right at the beginning this graphic appears; This is based on actual events.  Only the names, location, and actual events have been changed for this film.  I was the only person laughing at that, and then that was maybe the last time I laughed.  Anyone who is a fan of Fred Willard stealing a movie with few lines then you will like this, he is great.  Ferrell sidekicks in the movie are funny and the feud they have with Vince Vaughns news team is amusing.  Ferrell's is by far the least entertaining person in the whole movie.  It was like watching Ferrell & crew's first year of SNL when they just kept trying to be funny and you were praying for each skit to mercilessly be over.  Dodgeball was way funnier and that was not very funny.  I would totally not recommend this for anyone, people I am serious when I say save your money.  Next is King Arthur, which I though was well done.  It was not great and it had some Braveheart type moments that were a little cheesy.  It was a vastly different look at the Legend of Arhtur and his knights that has been portrayed on screen.  There was not a huge deal with Merlin and all the sorcery or Guinevere and her slutiness.  It focused on the knights and their quest to fulfill their duties.  It showed the first origins of the legend of Arthur (the 5th century version) where he battles the Saxons and it is torn between his allegiences to Rome and to his Woad (Britania native) tradition.  If you are a fan of the whole tale of Arhtur and the like then I feel you will enjoy this movie.  It is a good watch at the theatre and his something that will not leave you totally dissappointed like say, Anchorman.

       WARNING  This blog could be a little blue, so for adults or dirtbags only.  I was having a casual conversation with a friend of mine (A good Jew, Dan, not A Great Jew however) and the subject people being involved in inappropraite sexual relationshipd with minors came about. He turned me on to a case in Florida recently, where a 23 year old female teacher was fired for having sed relationship with a 14 yr old male student.  I did some research on this on my own and discovered that he was in fact telling the truth, and to boot the women is very attractive.  While in college she was a model for a local car magazine.  She also happens to be married, although not happily I presume, since she was boinking a 14 year old.  Hell 14 year olds barely have pubic hair and this lady was doing the horizontal tango with one.  What is worse about this whole thing is the way she got caught was his cousin told the authorities, what a fucking dick.  I would strangle this guy.  Now I know I speak for most of the men that read this and say where the heck was this chick when I was in High School.  Do you have any idea how many times I had to pleasure myself, when instead I could have been getting some nookie on the side from a 23 year old.  Geez I mean it took numerous date with women just to touch their boobies back then.  Maybe I just had my head up my ass throughout high school or was too busy discussing with my boyz when the next time we were gonna get high or drunk was.  Someone tell me did this kind of shit exist when we were in school?  I mean I have the unfortunate pleasure of knowing a lot of people and nobody I know has ever broken this fantastic news to me about their own high school experience.  This lady is now on administrative leave and presumably will be fired for being a sexual predator, which I guess is the right thing.  But if a man had committed this same "lude" act he would be villified all over the TV and internet, seen as a sickly and depraved human being.  Just a little double standard I wanted to make sure you were aware of.   What happened to America we used to have moral and values, but it seems we have thrown them out the window and caught a slow boat to Sex Island.  Only one problem you assholes forgot to tear me away from my PS2 when this boat was leaving, and now I am stranded on "Choke the Chicken" Island.  Yes I have a sick sense of humor, but hey get over it. This website is purely for entertainment purposes only, anyone who takes any of what I said seriously needs their head examined, preferably by a proctologist!

      What is the deal with Poker? Do we need 17 poker shows on television, are we this enthralled by a card game?  People insult Golf and say it is boring, well then what the hell is poker.  Now the game show network is having celebrity Black Jack, woo hoo I can't wait for this, second rate celebrities playing black jack.  We have officially hit a new low in American television.  I read a terrific article today about wild Leopards mauling people to death in the streets of Bombay.  Basically what has happened is these people believe so little in birth control that the population of Bombay has stretched the city limits into the forest region which borders the city.  By doing so they have decreased the food source for predators like Leopards, so the leopards have decided to start killing people in their yards and in the streets.  The leopards have done away with 14 people so far this year.  Sometimes I wonder why I am happy I live in America, and this would qualify as a good reason, I do not have to worry about constant leopard attacks.  AND  In my quest to know more about our Independence day I will share every once in awhile some facts about the men who signed the Declaration of Independence. Here is the story of Richard Stockton, born in NJ and educated at the College of New Jersey (Princeton) he had one of the most successful law pratices in the colonies.  He was elected to the Supreme Court of NJ and then was named to the Continental Congress to vote for succession from England.  However, he decided to wait till the last minute to vote, because he believed in hearing all the arguments first.  When the British invaded NJ he was captured and treated poorly as a prisoner of war.  When released he had nothing and soon after died a pauper basically on the streets of Princeton in 1781.  A true American patriot, Richard Stockton, signer of the Declaration of Independence.

      Today across this great country people will be celebrating the birth of a nation.  And how will Americans celebrate, well with consumption of everything they can get their hands on.  Fireworks, Hot Dogs, Pig Roasts, Coors Light, Sun Tan Lotion and whatever else we can get our hands on.  But again it seems that most Americans lose sight of what is really important, how and by whom this great land was found.   Most people can quote you part of the Declaration of Independence usuaully from the beginning about all men being created equal or the rights to pursue life, liberty and happiness, but it is the end of this document where the fore fathers of this country lay out their intentions and the foundation of this country:       We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.      Then after the document concludes it is signed by representatives from each colony, 56 signees in total.  Of those orginal 13 colonies I have lived in three of them (NJ, PA, SC) and 18 signees of the Declaration are from those three states.  Out of those 18 I have heard of three of them; Ben Franklin for obvious reasons and Richard Stockton (NJ) & Robert Morris (PA) only because they have universities named after them.  But otherwise I know nothing about these men or so many others that participated in this monumental event.    On this day, July 4, 2004, I have dedicated to myself that I am going to begin to learn more about each of these 56 men.  These 56 men are our "fore fathers" whom we so often refer to when we want to seem intelligent or get involved in a  political discussion, but so many of us know so little about them.  So it is my charge to all my friends and people across this country to please learn more about these men, this countries history, and at this time of crossroads in our nation lets use our brains to help lead us to become the greatest nation that any civilization has ever seen.  Peace & Love,  KD

      This is an all Sports Edition &nbsp; You know what I am sick of, self righteous baseball fans.&nbsp; "Oh, if the Yankees get Randy Johnson there is no justice."&nbsp;&nbsp;How about this asshole, GET OVER IT!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes the system in baseball is completely and utterly flawed, but you know what, that is not my fault.&nbsp; It is not George Steinbrenners fault&nbsp;either.&nbsp; Why can't other teams spend money?&nbsp; I don't know, someone tell me why, please.&nbsp; Big George loves to put all his money into trying to get the best baseball team he can.&nbsp; Since 2000 five teams have drawn more than 12 million fans (Cardinals, Giants, Mariners, Yankees, and Dodgers) so they have the ability to spend as much money as they Yankees, yes they certainly do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do they, most of them do not, so fuck 'em. &nbsp;Is it mine or Mr. Steinbrenner's fault that the Giants decided to only have a $59 million payroll, oh thats right, NO!!&nbsp; Of those 5 teams only 2 have made the World Series recently, fuck the Cardinals, Dodgers, &amp; Mariners if they want Randy Johnson they go and get him, don't tell me the Yankees just spend all their money on players, well duh that is the fucking point!!&nbsp; Screw Cubs fans, screw Competitive Balance, Screw the Oakland A's for playing "Money Ball", and oh yeah the Yanks haven't won shit since 2000, so stop being so whiney and dramatic about the whole damned thing.&nbsp; Spend some fucking money, sign free agents do whatever it takes, and it certainly does not take whinning and complaining. &nbsp; &nbsp; AND &nbsp; &nbsp; As the Kobe Turns.&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally we have a good idea who is going to be on the Lakers next year.&nbsp; Kobe says he just wanted to be a Laker (as long as Phil and Shaq aren't there).&nbsp; Could there be a man who's public persona has made such a u-turn in the span of a little over a year, the only athlete I can think of is OJ and he had to murder a few people.&nbsp; The Lakers are now a huge joke, and it is actually very amusing.&nbsp; But enough about the Lakers, some other basketball teams are making news too.&nbsp; Appearently the Nets have given up, winning must have been no fun.&nbsp; The Nuggets signing Kenyon Martin is a very good pick up, this gives them one of the 3 or 4 best frontlines in all of basketball.&nbsp; Lastly, in typical fashion the Spurs made a small move that nobody paid attention to, they signed Brent Barry which will help lead them to the NBA Finals.

      Well the first half of the baseball season is officially over and there is no shortage of stuff to talk about.  As most of you loyal readers know I am a stat fiend, especially when it comes to baseball.  So this column is my ode to Peter Gammons, Rob Neyer, and Jayson Stark.   BARRY LAMAR BONDS  Bonds has 71 intentional walks already this year.  He has more IBB than he does RBI, Hits, and he has 71 runs scored.  He has walkd a total of 131 times, that puts him on pace for 238 BB, and he has struck out a whopping 19 times.  He is also on pace to shatter his own OBP% record of .581 set two years ago. His current OBP is .626, here are some other hall of famers best seasons; Ruth .545, Griffey JR. .408, Cobb .486, Mays .425, Aaron .410, Dimaggio .459, Mantle .512, and Ted Williams .553 and he hit .406 that year.  Alex Rodriguez is having a great year too, he has 22 HR's out of 90 hits, that is good.  For his career he has 367 Home Runs, that is just plain filthy for his age.  And his best number so far is 18 SB in 20 tries,  he is a cleanup hitter.  The two best starters of the first half are both Senior circut guys, Ben Sheets and Jason Schmidt.  Sheets has walked only 19 batters and fanned 130.  His WHIP is .99 and hitters are hitting .200 against him.  Those are great numbers, and Schmidts are better.  He has thrown 3 one hitters and in 12 of his 17 starts he has given up 2 runs or less.  Batters are hitting just .174 against him and his WHIP is .96.  Those numbers are ridiculous.  And one more pitchers numbers, Mariano Rivera has 32 saves and an ERA of 0.99.  Michael Young is the best player you have never heard of, he leads the majors in hits with 127.  That outs him on pace for 240 hits.  Since 1980 only 6 people have had more than 230 hits.  The most hits Pete Rose ever had in a season is 230.  This will put Michael Young in some lofty company.  Finally, something near and dear to me, the Jeter slump.  He has raised his average to .277 after his early season struggles. Everything changed on May 25 when he was hitting .189, he got three hits that day and was on his way. From the season opener till May 25th Jeter had only 31 hits, since then he has 61 in 160 AB's.  That puts his average at .381 since the end of May.  During his slump he had only 2 3+ hit games and had 17 hitless games.  Since he has had 9 3+ hit games and has gone hitless in only 5 games.  So it looks like Jeter told everyone to "Slump This."  Those are just some fancy numbers from baseballs first half.  There are sure to be some great moments in the 2nd half.  Here are a few predictions, Carlos Beltran will be traded, Larry Bowa & Jimy Williams will not make it till seasons end, the Red Sox will soon fall apart, Randy Johnson will be moved (but look for a team like the Angels or Giants to get into the mix, so he can still be close to home), and the Braves will win the NL East again just to piss everyone off.

      Now that I am all grown up and I understand things better I am always concerned with the political climate of my country.  I try to gather as much information as I can and make rational decisions about candidates and issues I feel strongly about.   Such as terrorism, the war, the economy, and the state of education in this country (someone brought up stem cell research today, and I still have no idea what that is or why it is an "issue"). I have been trying to read and watch as much as I can about these men that are in line to run country for the next fours years, but honestly I cannot feel my brain anymore.  This years election promises to be one for the ages, an incumbent who may have ruined his shot at re-election in the same manner his father did a decade ago and a challenger who can't make up his mind most of the time, and who chose a vice presidential nominee whose political career spans a monumental 6 years.  However, John Edwards lack of political experience may be a huge benefit in the minds of a lot of voters.     The big issue that this whole election is about is the War in Iraq and the war on Terror.  Let's be honest with each other, some people will tell you the economic situation and unemployment rate are important, but take it from a guy who lives in the South most of the uneducated people in this country care more about which set of brown people we are going to bomb next.  And these people love to get out and vote, mainly because they have the time because they have no jobs.    The question remains did Iraq pose and impending threat to the safety of this country and did they have WMD's.  Well therein lies the problem, it all depends on who you believe.  I watched a great interview on Meet the Press with Jay Rockerfeller (D) and Grant Roberts (R)(the 2 men heading up the inquiry into the intelligence departments findings in Iraq) about how the problem with the Presidents decision to go to war was the fact that the documents he was given about WMD's were completely made up.  Something like 75% of the information in them was false, now we have the source of the problem, but digging to the root is a whole different issue.  Senator Kerry will tell you that Dick Cheney bullied George Tenant and other Intelligence Department officials to make sure those documents supported a war.  Republicans will tell you that the President was relying on the information he was given and acting in the best interest of the people.  Keep in mind folks, what I have just written is a very brief synopsis of the whole problem.  Now you see why my head hurts.  Then my vision is going to get more murky when I go see Farenheit 9/11 this week.  What needs to happen in this country is someone needs to step forward and address issues like education on the homefront and then these problems will begin to work themselves out. I'll make a sports analogy for everyone; If I am playing football and the other team drops back to throw a 75 yard bomb and they complete the pass way downfield and then just before the guy gets in the endzone we miss an open field tackle and some yuck from the stands yells ahh crap we can't tackle.  I first address the initial problem, why did we not get pressure on the QB, what happened in our coverage breakdown, then why did we miss the tackle.    We have millions of kids going through this country with no freaking idea about anything.  Stupidity lead to ignorance and ignorance leads to hate and hate has an ugly way of working itself out, with things like I dunno terrorist bombings and then wars against people in countries whom 85% of America could not identify on a map.  And another things no more having fucking babies, keep your legs closed ladies and men keep your dick in your pants sometimes.  We have uneducated people with no jobs having children, who are bound t be uneducated and wind up with no job and then so on.  If you have a kid and you have no job, boom You the girl and the child shot dead, simple solution, I know seems a bit radical but could that make things worse?  See why my head hurts, this rant started out about the election and has morphed into a bunch of non-sense about killing people.  My whole point is when I try and learn stuff about these candidates and keep a level head about things it always seems like Lucy pulls the ball away just before I kick it, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!

      I know it has been awhile since the last movie review, but nothing worth seeing has come out in the past two weeks.&nbsp; However, this all changed this week with the latest adaptation of&nbsp; a Robert Ludlum novel, The Bourne Supremecy.&nbsp; Matt Damon is back for another round as super CIA agent Jason Bourne.&nbsp;   Let me say this right away, if you liked the first one you will certainly enjoy the second one.&nbsp; Damon does another good job in this movie, he plays his character very sympathetically.&nbsp; Basically the Russian CIA wants to take him out because of information he has, which of course he does not know he has.&nbsp; Well Bourne gets pissed off and thinks the CIA is trying to take him out and goes back after them, only to realize that they are looking for him because the Russians have set him up and made it look as if he has killed some CIA agents.&nbsp; Twisty and turny, again filming on location all over the world, Mr. Bourne kicks some serious ass.&nbsp; And for those of you who know me well you know I am not all into action adventure movies like this, but the plot is well done and Matt Damon and Joan Allen give very good performances.&nbsp; The editing of the movie can get a&nbsp; little mind numbing sometimes, it is that fats paced quick cut jumping back and forth editing, but I think it adds to the story of how he escapes several times.&nbsp; Overall it is a solid movie, again much along the lines of the first one.&nbsp; The ending was kinda blah, but did not ruin the movie.&nbsp; It left it very open for another sequel (I do not know how many Ludlum novels there are in the series) but I can see this being very Jack Ryan'ish.&nbsp; With&nbsp; the star power and acting chops of Matt Damon they will certainly be able to try another movie with this character.   On side note, it is scary how much of a better actor Matt Damon is over his longtime boyfriend Ben Afflack.&nbsp; One has talent and good looks and&nbsp;the other has good looks, famous girlfriends and an obsession with the Red Sox.

      I have so many things to get off my fat chest.  What the fuck is with SUV's in this damned country?&nbsp; This whole SUV shit is out of control.&nbsp; First of all these things take up so much space on the road, you cannot see anything around them.&nbsp; Godforbid you are trying to make a turn and one is abstructing your view, you could not see Godzilla coming from behind one of these things.&nbsp; All these things do is suck down gas like a high school girl sucks dick at a Toga Party.&nbsp; They are always among the least safest vehicles on the road and most of the people who have them require no more than two seats in their car.&nbsp; Most of them have no more room inside of them than my Saturn does, they just give the illusion that they are roomy and they are just plain uncomfortable.&nbsp; If you have a some kids and a family it is so much more economical to get a Mini Van which get great gas mileage (and all you people do is complain about gas prices while you ride around in these fucking things that get 2 miles to the gallon) and are always among the safest vehicles around.&nbsp; All you fucks say you care about your kids and your families and you insist on putting them at great risk by driving around in these death machines, but instead of flying your family to Florida on a plane, which you are all deathly afraid of, you put them in a terrible vehicle on the road for 12 hours, a circumstance where they are way more likely to pay with their lives.  This country is so obsessed with sex it is ridiculous.&nbsp; The other day I am watching television and a commercial for Certs comes on and the hot blonde actress talks about how much "bigger" Certs now are.&nbsp; After some other nonsense in the commercial she talks about how "bigger" Certs should "last longer" and gives&nbsp; sexy wanna suck your dick smile to the camera.&nbsp; Is this what&nbsp;America has&nbsp;come too, we need sex to sell Certs?&nbsp; This country has losts its freaking mind, no wonder all these kids are going around having children all the damned time, everything is Sex, Sex, Sex!!  Now another thing I have a problem with is the fact that we have 2 different pills that can help old, horny, sex obsessed people get a hard on.&nbsp; Hell Levitra advertises how it may give you a four hour erection, but have we come up with anything to help cancer patients?&nbsp; Or maybe something to battle MS?&nbsp; No, but shit if old people really need to slap some old wrinkly asses we got all the pills you need.  A little over a year ago NASA flew and unmanned space probe to Mars (which is 33,900,000 to 249,000,000 from Earth) with a rover inside of it.&nbsp; We successfully landed the probe on Mars and since have controlled the rover all around the surface of "The Red Planet", but I cannot get cell phone reception in my apartment?&nbsp; What the hell is wrong with this picture?&nbsp; I mean seriously, we obviously have the nerds to be able to create such things, lets get them snapping on some cell reception.&nbsp; Whenever I go under an overpass my signal goes out, but a bunch of MIT grads who get laid less than me are playing with a joystick in Houston and controlling a little toy truck on Mars.  Finally, did you ever notice how they organize things in a grocery store.&nbsp; Always at the end of the fruit & vegetable section they have the Tostitos and Oreos and all that shit.&nbsp; They are always right next to each other.&nbsp; Are they trying to guilt people into something?&nbsp; Coming from a&nbsp; a true fat person, I could care less if I have to walk past the asparagus to get to the Doritos.&nbsp; I love Doritos, hell you could put some bulls from Pamplona in my way and I am going to get those fuckign tasty ass Doritos.&nbsp; Fat people will always get there food, like&nbsp;Heroin addicts will get there smack.&nbsp;

      Today was maybe the biggest most important movie day in the history of the world, or at least in my little corner of it.  I caught a four peat, for the price of 3 matinee's.  That is what we like to call special and/or disturbed.  I am going to have 2 different posts; the first will deal with the 4 movies I saw and the second will deal with the   myriad   of bad previews I saw.  Here are the 4 movies in order of review, The Village, Farenheit 9/11, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, and Napoleon Dynamite.  The Village is perhaps the most anticipated movie of the summer (sans Garfield of course) and to me it was not a dissappointment as so many "experts" have stated.  Honestly, you can't say too much about this movie without giving it away.  I am sure all of you know the premise by now and I will say that it is fairly predictable, except for the final twist.   The movie starts off very very slow and seems to drag on at the beggining until we get to the real character development.  There is only one time were Shyamalan wants you to jump out of your seat and I must say it worked for everyone in the theatre including yours truly.  The film is certainly carried by the strong cast, probably the best ensemble I have seen in awhile.  Phoenix, Brody, and Hurt are all super strong and Bryce Howard (daughter of Ron Howard) is absouletly   marvelous  .  The last time I saw a new actress with that much   magnatism   on screen was Kate Hudson in Almost Famous, during the entire film your eyes are just drawn to her and everything she is doing.  Lastly, Shyamalan has a   magnificent   cameo (he uses that Hitchcockian technique in all his films) near the end.  I thought the Sixth Sense was good and I was not a fan of Shyamalan's efforst in Unbreakable & Signs, but I feel he redeems himself here.  This is a good film with great acting and very cerebral.  Now we get to Farenheit 9/11, which has again picked up steem with the Democratic National Convention.  Michael Moore is an absolutely brilliant filmmaker which has been known for some time.  He uses great pop references, music and humor all at the correct time.  And yes this film does make one step back and think about certain things.  However, it goes to great lengths to crucify George Bush in every matter under the sun.  I believe Bush conspired with the CIA, Jack Ruby,  Caiphas, and Pouintus Pilot to kill Jesus, John Kennedy and Thousands of Americans on Septemeber 11.  The main breadth if the movie talks about the Bush family and Bin Laden family connections in the oil business, well no shit they are both rich oil families it would seem to reason that they have similar interests and investments.  He talks of how Bush and his friend from the Army National Guard James Bath have invested in companies together and one of those companies had investors that were in the Bin Laden family.  Well me and Lionel Dahmer worked on the assembly line next to one another and ate lunch three  together times a week at the House of Pancakes so I should be held responsible for Jeffrey Dahmer murdering young men?  I am just saying in a lot of the movie he is reaching for things to try and prove his point.  No doubt the film was well thought out, well directed and well recieved by audiences,  I wish Michael Moore the best and hope he dies in a fiery auto wreck on the way home tonite.  Harodl and Kumar should have never gone to the set.  And unfrotunately if this movie makes money they are going to Amsterdam in the sequel.  Not much I can say about this piece of trash. It is a buddy/advneture picture that is supposed to make you laugh and slap the guy next to you and say "dude that same thing happened to us one night."  Unfortunately I never got mistaken as an emergency room doctor and had to save a mans life in surgery, never picked up a washed up child star like Neil Patrick Harris and watched him steal my car, and never hang glided down a cliff for a hamburger.  Outside of that yeah me, Harold and Kumar have so much in common, we all like tits & weed.  Fred Willard has a scene at the beginning that is great and there is one time where they are driving down the road and they catch each other head bobbing to Wilson Phillips "Hold On" and they begin to sing along as we all have.  I do not recommend this, like most of the summer comedies you can see where the humor is supposed to be but the jokes just never deliver.  I will leave you with the funniest part of the move, one of the secondary characters is wearing a T-shirt that says the following: Ass...............The other Vagina  Finally I ended my day with Napoleon Dynamite.  How one describes this movie I do not know.  It follows the life of the nerdiest guy in the history of school out in a  little podunk town in Idaho.  Now having been to Idaho and Wyoming and met a number of teens and young 20 somethings from these areas I understand the total despair of lifestyle these people live in.  Napoleon lives with his grandmother and loser brother.  His aging hipster Uncle comes to take care of them, all while Napoleon finds a friend at school and a girl he can actually talk to.  The movie is slow at points and sometimes hard to figure out what the point is.  Mainly I took it as everyones life has some meaning even if it is their own weird world.  There is nobody really of note in this movie except for Deidrich Bader (Drew Carey Show & Office Space) and Hailey Duff (who has really fat legs).  I doubt many people will like it, it is strange very much in the same way brilliant movies like Rusmore, Clerks, Welcome to the Dollhouse and Bottle Rocket were strange.  I would go see it again over any of the other summer comedies like Dodgeball, Anchorman, and Harold and Kumar.  So that was my big day at the movies, if their is a bigger loser in the house please stand and be recognized.

      John Kerry officially accepted the Democratic Nomination for President.&nbsp; He gave easily his most passionate speech ever and I now believe he has a legitimate shot had winning the upcoming election.&nbsp; The convention was one of the dullest ever and experts all agreed that Kerry really needed to rally the troops.&nbsp; He was passionate, he was clear in his ideals, he was critical more of the Vice Presiedent&nbsp;& other cabinet members rather than George Bush, and he spoke often of his&nbsp;ability to lead due to his miltary service.&nbsp; My favorite part of the speech was when he spoke of Bush's words immediately following 9/11 about how we needed to become&nbsp;one America, and how he&nbsp;believes in this ideal and will work to bring everyone in America together.&nbsp;  Hope is on the Way is the message the Democrats have adopted, and I think people may believe this bullshit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The democrats are really banking on John Edwards being the American dream, the son of a mill worker who wroked his way up and has only had a brief career in politics.&nbsp; Kerry spoke of how no American will need to worry about his/her prescription drugs and no more outsourcing of jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke of re-expanding the middle class and trying to eliminate poverty. &nbsp;Colin Quinn made a great point about this on Tough Crowd, every four years the party not in the White House talks of how they are going to help the poor people and give every one a&nbsp; fair shot, and nothing ever changes.  One thing that seems to have been overlooked in Kerry's speech&nbsp; is his promise to basically increase military spending.&nbsp; He spoke of employing more troops (adding 40,000 full time personnell), increasing special ops forces to combat terrorism, and &nbsp;a complete overhaul of the intelligence community.&nbsp; All these will cost a boat load of money and where & when he said this in the speech seem to get drowned out by his ra-ra stuff.&nbsp; I just hope he takes into considertation things like Education and the rising number of teenage&nbsp;& single parent households.  Hopefully, Hope is on the Way.

      Really I have nothing to add today, or any other day for that matter.  I think humans are avoiding me because they know how much they piss me off.  I do have a weekend full of travel and slutty white women ahead of me.  I  am certain to have some great stories from a weekend spent in the BWI corridor with people who have names like; Whitey, Marshmellow, Showers, and Clog.  And I am certain none of those stories will involve me and the slutty white women.  So I will be tardy on my movie reviews because I will not get to the theatre until Sunday or Monday.  Please keep reading the site and posting ridiculous responses three times in a row, MARK.  I will certainly come up with something more entertaining to write soon I promise.  I leave you tonite with a favorite quote of mine:  "When a man, for whatever reason, has the opportunity to lead an extraordinary life, he has no right to keep it to himself"

        NOTE:  This is for the true baseball geek only.        On this the second day of August 2004 we remember the life  and times of the great Thurman Munson.  He was a Yankee, a Captain, a teammate and by all accounts a great person.  So the question still remains why is he not in The Baseball Hall of Fame?  There is plenty of precident here, Roberto Clemente was enshrined immediately after his tragic death, Sandy Koufax was a first ballot hall of famer for a body of work that consisted of 5 great years, and countless number of Negro League players were inducted for feats they may or may not have acheived.  Munson career was tragically cut short, I do not think you can hold that against him.  The only thin you can do is examine his body of work as it exists and compare it to his contemperaries. Me being the baseball freak, I have done the research for you and will now present it to you.  Thurman Munson played 11 seasons and made 7 All-Star appearences. He was the 1970 Rookie of the Year, 1976 AL MVP, and 3 Time Gold Glove winner.  He batted .292 for his career, had 3 100 RBI Seasons, and 5 seasons were he batted over .300.  Those are some very good numbers, he was always amongst the best players in the league, and he was known as the best clutch hitter in the game.  That was most evident in the post season, where he batted .357 slugged .497 and had 22 RBI in just 30 games.  Here is a list of people who played alongside Munson wh are all in the Hall of Fam:  Carlton Fisk, Tony Perez, Reggie Jackson, Rod Carew, Joe Morgan, Johnny Bench, Carl Yastremski, Willie Stargell, Billy Williams and Willie McCovey.  Now some of these guys can be excluded from the argument because they have the magic numbers to get in the Hall, such as: Jackson (500 HR), Carew (3,000 Hits), Yaz (3,000),  and McCovey (500).  So now lets look at the rest of these guys.  Fisk....   .269 BA/3 .300 plus seasons/ 2 100 RBI Seasons/11 All Star games   Perez...  .279 BA/2 .300 plus seasons/.238 BA & 25 RBI in 47 post season games   Morgan .271 BA/2 .300 plus seasons/ .182 post season BA   Bench... .267 BA/1 .300 plus season/ 154 hits per 162(Munson 177)/ .266 20 RBI in 45 post season games   Stargell .282/5 100 RBI seasons/3 .300 plus seasons/ 7 All Star games/ .266 20 RBI in 36 post season games   Williams .290/3 100 RBI seasons/5 .300 plus seasons/6 All Star games  I will leave the rest up to you.
