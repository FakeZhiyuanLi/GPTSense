      Hey everyone, and by everyone, I mean Uram, the only person who reads this.  Today's been a solid day-- got lots of great feedback on my first paper for my law firm, beat Jeanette's ASS in racquetball, and am getting ready to go meet up with my estranged lil' bro, Rusckel the Love Musckel.  This weekend's going to be beyond awesome, with my first paycheck, a Double Header at PNC tomorrow, a baseball game on Saturday, and my Aunt/landlord's RETIREMENT PROMAPALOOZA on the Gateway Clipper Sunday! AWAL's getting here tomorrow afternoon to be my mega-date, (my dad is so jealous), and then it's four four days of Me, Kup, Drew, Kris, Megan and Ang raising hell in the city.  If you're local, give us a call!  everyone else- have a great weekend/Memorial Day, and remain awesome.

      So summer movies have arrived, and they’ve arrived in style, so far.  I’ve been lucky and have seen a hell of a string of movies in the theatre this year, dating back to Big Fish back in January, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind back in March.  But away from the sappier fanfare, summer is the time for fun, and the movies I’ve seen so far fit the bill.  Van Helsing—solid popcorn movie that’s better and more fun than it has any right to be.  Jackman is damn solid, as is Faromir from Lord of the Rings as the monk-sidekick.  Clever re-imaging of oldschool monsters and good plot twists, and Kate Beckinsale as the hottest heroine on celluloid (at least until my girlfriend Keira returns later this summer).  Troy—Everything I wanted out of it and more.  Sure, there was no interaction with the gods, and that was sort of a bummer, but the “This is how it REALLY happened” feel to the flick actually worked, and was used cleverly.  Brad Pitt, action star? Who’dathunk it would work, but it did, and the Hector/Achilles fight instantly became one of my hands down movie favorites.  Speaking of Hector, Eric Bana straight up CARRIES THIS MOVIE ON HIS BACK, and proves that his boring-ass turn in HULK had nothing to do with his acting skills.  Badass fight scenes, beautiful ladies, and enough naked Brad Pitt to convince your girlfriend to see it instead of the Stepford Wives, and you can’t lose. Can’t wait for the DVD.  Shrek 2—Funniest goddamn movie I’ve seen in a LONG time.  Actually, probably the most I’ve ever laughed in a theatre.  Just beautifully animated, cleverly written, and ridiculously imaginative.  Banderas as “Puss in Boots” would be my favorite movie character if I were 8, and the fact they actually used the old “why the long face” joke, and it WORKED, and it was HILARIOUSLY executed makes this probably the best date movie to come along in a long time.    Now, someone hurry up and bring me Spidey 2, King Arthur, and Dodgeball!  Oh, and Uram says stay FAR away from “The Day After Tomorrow,” to which I say… duh.  Anybody out there want to post me a quick review of The Punisher or Hellboy? In the meantime kiddies, stay awesome 	-apk

      Yes, the party that ROCKED Mill Ray Acres in the summer of 2001 has RETURNED, BIGGER, BADDER, and UNCUT!  so I'm headed out to Z's for the party, I'm sure there will be some sort of ridiculous stories to talk about when i get back.  Any of  you D-Sonians who went back to Carlisle for Alumni Weekend this weekend, sign on and give us a quick report.  Oh- and Happy Birthday Lara!  And if you're out there, and just perusing, just sign a comment and say hello, I'm interested to see if anyone other than Uram reads this.  -apk

      Okay, so it's been a while, I'm sure all of my loyal readers (both of you) missed me.  So what's happened of late, you ask? Not a ton, but enough, here's a quick story, though.  I go home to the Hacienda in Herminie this morning because my soon-to-be brother-in-law, Chris, and my Dad cooked up this scheme the want to do for the reception.  Apparently, they believe it'd be funny if my dad, my brother, and I all dressed up hillbilly style, and made a small motion picture where Chris approaches us on the wedding day, and claims that he cannot marry my sister, because he doesn't think he can fit in with the "Western PA lifestyle."  At that point, my dad has my brother and me chase Chris around the yard, and kick his ass, as my dad threatens him with a shotgun. (I couldn't make this up).  So here's the kicker-- we tape everything, and it's actually sort of funny, imagine my brother and in bib-overalls with hunting hats and mullets dragging Chris to my bro's pickup truck and tossing him in the back.  My dad hops on the edge, sitting on the tailgate and holding the shotgun, as I let out a "rebel yell" and my brother gets behind the wheel.  Not realizing that my dad was sitting on the end, my brother goes peeling out of the driveway, and makes a hard right onto the street by our house, when-- you guessed it-- MY DAD GOES FLYING OUT OF THE TRUCK!  So my dad turfs it HARDCORE on his back, and my mom's freaking out and my brother can't decide whether to run for the border, or beg for forgiveness.   In the end, my dad was a-okay, the movie's great, and I've just set the over/under on my sister's divorce at 1-day, because she's going to go batshit at the reception out of embarrassment when she sees it.  This is my family. This is my life. And this is why I'm so fucked up.  ...at least now that i'm my dad's favorite, i'm that much closer to inheriting the RX-8.  That's all for now,  keep it real, my peoples.

      Oh where oh where to begin...  First off, I want to thank Kup for braving the hordes of Geekdom and staying up until 3am to do it-- it takes a special kind of friend to put up with that many geeks at once.  Now, on to the show.  The short review is thus, as spoken by Kup, "It was better than the first one."  My review, well, that's going to take a bit longer. Without giving anything away: IT'S SO MUCH MORE INCREDIBLE THAN THE FIRST ONE.  You see, I counted "Spider-Man" as the finest superhero film ever made when it came out two years ago.  I thought it was better than even the first Superman, and that's saying quite a ton.  I even thought it stood out even in comparison to X2, my personal favorite.  I figured that once my X-Men bias was taken out of the equation, they come out pretty much equal.  Well, true believers, if you liked either Spider-Man or X2, you'll LOVE this movie.  There's so much good to talk about, but I'll try to keep it short.  First, EVERY performance here is fantastic, even James Franco (who i think acts about as well as cardboard) brings the goods.  And yes, although she starts out slowly, without a ton to play with, even Kirsten comes around by the end, delivering the movie's most memorable line (at least for Geeks) in just the way she should.  Maquire is AMAZING, Molina (while not diabolical) truly captures Doc Ock, and JK Simmons continues to chew scenery and steal every scene he's in.  Aunt May is perfect, and none of the cameos miss a beat. (I refuse to ruin any surprises.)  The true star, here, though, is Director Sam Raimi.  He just LET'S LOOSE with this thing.  Doc Ock's first big scene just SCREAMS "EVIL DEAD" and is as much fun as that sentence indicates.  Spidey swinging around? That should be old hat by now, right? NO WAY-- Raimi takes it to a whole new level (with CGI that blows the first movie's out of the water), and the "Big Train Scene" is flat-out amazing.  Nothing's perfect, and there are miniscule nit-picky issues with the movie, but if you dwell on them-- you're missing the point.  (And the little things missing were probably cut or shortened out of time, or will be dealt with soon...)  Where the movie excells though, is that for the first time in a superhero movie, you're not a spectator.  You actually become immersed in Peter Parker's shitty life, and get just as mixed up about what he should do as he is, and that's the mark of a great movie.  Peter's own personal hell, yet fight to overcome and remain a hero is what has made the comic resonate for 40 years, and it resonates in this movie.  I'd hate to call it the "best superhero movie ever" (even though it is), because that's really short-changing it.  It's really just a fantastic movie all around, and those that might get caught up in "geeky superheroey-ness" of it all are probably the same people that will, to this day, refuse to read a comic book, because they're "for kids."  Now, now, I realize it's a big summer blockbuster popcorn movie- and it is that.  But it's so GOOD at being that, because its so much MORE, if that makes any sense.  I won't delve any deeper, because yinz probably won't want to listen to me rant about the comic book character as the modern myth, or about how both the medium (and especially the "superhero" concept) are one of the only truly American artforms, in the same way that Jazz is, so here's the final word.  It's a TON of fun, with a TON of laughs, a TON of excitement and chills, etc.  ..but it's got even more characater, and more heart.  I couldn't recommend it more. Go see it NOW-- I'm going again on Friday.  AND, as always, I'd love to hear what you have to think!  -apk

      My pain is mighty!  Well, it's not THAT bad-- you see, folks, I pulled the living bejeebus out of my right Hamstring last night during my ballgame.  Worst part was, we only had 9 players, so I had to stay in the game and tough it out at first base.  Sure, sure, I've not played first base in about 12 years, but what does that REALLY mean?   All in all, i survived, and even didn't really screw up there. Sure, we got routed, but by about the fourth inning, we all stopped caring all started having fun. So it was cool.  now to more important news- it's almost 5pm, which means we are just a SMIDGE more than 7 hours away from my EVENT OF THE SUMMER: SPIDER-MAN 2!  man o' man! i CAN'T WAIT. stay tuned to this blog for a review sometime tomorrow!  until next time, true believers, POST COMMENTS! -apk

      Bill Simmons, the "Sports Guy" of ESPN.com's page 2, who's just about the funniest damn sports/pop culture columnist on the PLANET has started a mini-site over there.  Part of the site is a blog-type column thing he posts every couple of days, and has been trying to come up with a title for.  What did he say he's leaning towards in his latest column?  "More Cowbell"  i shit you not.  and Banner, thanks for posting-- here's a little advice for you: "She's Good Enough for Government Work, but she's Gotta Have More Cowbell!"  -apk

      Hey there kids, I've missed you all.  Which brings me to first point-- is anybody out there? I know I get occassional traffic from Uram and Jeanie and Carolyn, and I think that Jack's left me a couple of posts, but is that all there is? Is that the best I can do?  If so, it's cool-- i thank you for all for reading.  So let's have some fun!  We're going to get INTER-ACTIVE ...ACtive... Active.. active..   Perhaps Tuesday will be POLL DAY around here, so witout further ado, here's my first poll question:  Okay, so right now it's summer, which puts me in hardcore movie mode. I've seen Spider-Man 2 three times already, Dodgeball twice, and basically everything else that has looked cool since Jan 1.  So here's a question for y'all:  "What's the best movie you've seen this calendar year, and why did you like it so much?"  You can just say, "Van Helsing: it was fun" or you can go into a full on diatribe like I did about Spidey Dos, whatever suits your fancy.  Just please either leave your real name, or some sort of crazy handle.   And once(ie: if) people start posting stuff, feel free to disagree and leave comments to their comments! It takes a village to build an online blog, or something like that.  Let's have some fun, and let's play nice, too (this means YOU Uram!) Although my kingdom is a democracy, I'll still lay the Ashcroft-style Smackdown of Censoreship on any posts that just aren't swell.  As for my vote, keep in mind i said the "best" movie, which is totally subjective.  My three FAVORITES, in no order are Spider-Man 2 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Big Fish  Eternal Sunshine's probably the best of the three, and I hope to all things holy it wins best picture next year, but will probably be forgotten by the time the Oscars come 'round.. at least the DVD's out soon..  til' next time, I'm either preparing for Adina's wedding, or standing in line for "Anchorman"  be cool to each other, -apk

      I stayed in last night, for about the first time in 2 ½ weeks, and it felt great.&nbsp; As I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark (easily one of the 30 best movies of the last 25 years), I realized that Karen Allen’s character, Marian Ravenwood, is probably one of the Top 10 Best Potential Girlfriends in any movie, ever.  &nbsp;  Now, hear me out on this one, although Karen Allen got old REALLY quickly sometime after she appeared in Bill Murray’s “Scrooged,” she was pretty cute back then, in a very “just one of the guys” kind of ways.&nbsp; She’s got the sexy voice thing going for her, and has piercing eyes, as well.&nbsp; And Marian Ravenwood, her character, is just a cool chick.&nbsp; She’s flighty and needy at all the right times, but is generally able to really take care of herself. She knocks out two bad guys all on her own, then is the only female this side of Spaceballs to actually have the presence of mind to get behind a gun and start shooting when she takes control of the airplane turret and starts shooting Nazi’s like it’s going out of style.&nbsp; She’s also got a quick wit, a hard nose, and can drink any man under the table. I’m telling you, this is a girl for all seasons.&nbsp; You could take her home to mom, and dad would be proud of you for scoring a looker; and then you’d leave home and she’d want to go to a ballgame and drink some beers with your frat brothers.  &nbsp;  What do you guys think? I know she’s not the hottest movie girl ever, but I’ll stand by the fact that I think she’s one of the most datable. She’s perfect girlfriend material.&nbsp; Ladies, you can get in on this one too, either tell me if you think I’m nuts as to what constitutes “datable” or throw some guys out there. Think outside the box—I don’t want to hear about how dreamy Brad Pitt is in Ocean’s Eleven.&nbsp; I’d rather hear how you’d like to date, I dunno, Harrison as Indiana Jones, because he’s rugged, yet charming. Know what I mean? This is more of a personality test.  &nbsp;  Let the games begin!  -apk

      This morning I heard Kup’s alarm go off, and realized he’s a “Music Guy.”  I, being an “Annoying Alarm Sound Guy” began to wonder, “how many people use the music alarm, compared to how many use the annoying alarm.”  Chime in on this one, friends, it’s the kind of the stuff that keeps me awake at night.   Last night at my baseball game, I was, as usual the 10th man, and thus, the only guy on the bench. Not a big deal, I don’t mind it, because I’m getting the biggest kick just being on a team, and my time will come. (Especially now that my arm is finally coming back around—I had a guy tell me “man, you throw pretty good, did you used to pitch” yesterday. Humorous if you know about my singular pitching exploit in college.  But, in my defense, I HAVE always had pretty exceptional mechanics when it comes to throwing, I have to be able to do SOMETHING right on the field.  So we’re in the top of the 2d, and the Ump’s been using a pretty liberal interpretation of the strike zone against us.  (Translation: he blows.) Well, our 38 year-old shortstop, Gino, gets rung up, makes a comment akin to “why don’t you at least kiss me the next time you screw me” and finds himself ejected from the game.  Before I know it, I’m whisked off the bench and into the INFIELD to play 3D BASE. Now, wayyy back in the day, I used to be a pretty damned good 3d baseman. That was until the end of Little League, when, in the course of a “Coaches v. Players” game, I took a HARD chopper square in the eye.  I flirted with the position here and there afterwards in pony and colt league, however, the wreckless abandon and fearlessness I had played the position with had been replaced with an acute subconscious case of “scared shitlessness,” and I became a full-time outfielder.  All-in-all, my great 3d Base experience didn’t go poorly, but didn’t go well, either.  EVERY ball hit my way ended up far into the hole.  I was visibly dejected and pissed at myself for just BARELY not getting to any of the four singles that way, but, again to my credit, Trigger, the normal 3d Baseman consoled me by explaining, “you’re not getting burned over there—don’t worry, all those shots are through the hole.” So I felt better.   When it was all said an done, we lost the game 3-2, but I DID contribute to our first run when I moved fellow law student Dave from 2d to 3d on a sacrifice bunt that I nearly legged out for a single.  Todd Mary Lou would’ve been so proud of me. Thanks to Steve Beyer, wherever you are, for teaching me how to bunt like a champ.    So that was my night—I’ve now played LF, RF, 1B, and 3B this season, meaning I’m the ultimate utility man, or something. Just like my favourite ballplayer, Pirate Rob Mackowiak (“3 HARD SWINGS! DON’T GET CHEATED!)  Carbon Leaf review coming up soon, but I’ll probably take a day or two away from it, then go back and see what’s REALLY stuck for me. Right now, I’m listening to the Hootie & the Blowfish self-titled album from last spring.   Commence laughter.  Until later, -apk

      Well, Marc and Kup have been around the blog for about 20 minutes now, and they both took time to chastise me today for not writing about Independence Day with the d-Generation.    Never being one to cause controversy or upset my loyal listeners, and feeling a little guilty for getting sappy today, I’ve decided to oblige them and give a recap of the weekend that was the 4th. (and in honesty, it’s all finally starting to come back to me now, anyway).  The story begins with 16 fluid ounces of red-cupped fury.  My pledge class, d-Generation OX, all got together for the weekend in beautiful central PA.  The eight of us (Buff, Bromberg, Kup, myself, Kurt, Jerry, Marc, and Taylor) have not all been together since graduation time, May 2002.  I had to stay back here in the ‘burgh Friday night, so Kurt drove from Columbus, met Kup and Jerry, and headed out together.  Similarly, Broms and Marc traveled from Boston together to Taylor’s house.  Taylor, having recently returned from Ahghanistan, was excited to see all of us, I’m sure, and it was great to see him back home, and safe for now.    So Taylor’s brother throws a party for him on Saturday, which, as I noted, I missed.  Apparently, sometime during the festivities, a water battle erupted.  Jamie (who came up from Philly, despite being a year ahead of us), aka “Bruce Banner,” nailed Jerry in the face with a water balloon sometime during the fracas.  It was at this point that Jerry reportedly went batshit, threw all of Kup and Kurt’s stuff out of his car, and sped away to his girlfriends. NOT, however, before getting revenge as it is best served. No, not as a cold dish, but in the forms of 16 FLUID OUNCES OF RED-CUPPED FURY! Seriously, he dumped a red cup full of icewater on Jamie’s car.  The damage done to Banner’s Dodge Avenger was estimated at somewhere around 7,000 Afghanis.  Thus, a new catch phrase was born.  The next day found me arriving right in time to watch Broms, Marc, and Kurt use their out-of-state IDs to purchase about 100 bucks worth of illegal fireworks.  Once we made it to Buff’s dad’s house for some of the BEST PULLED PORK…. … … EVER, it was time for the random hilarity of Monkey Rocket Racing (Winner:  Kupchelitis), random Boom Boom, and the Bottle Rocket that Marc shot at the neighbor’s car, “inadvertently” …rigggght.  After watching the Hot Dog eating contest on ESPN and a little Rocky V, it was time to head to Taylor’s financee, Mary’s house.  There we stood in AWE of her father’s INCREDIBLE BASEMENT BAR, and ran in horror from the Wimeraner Humping Machine known as “Tasha.”  Apparently FEMALE dogs will hump your leg, too, in order to show dominance.  Banner, Kurt, and I were all fortunate enough to learn this the hard way.  On the plus side, it was the most action I’ve had in a while.  We then headed out to Harrisburg, where, besides witnessing the worst display of fireworks in, well.. pretty much all of recorded history, we found ourselves a bar, and rang up an 80 tab! (yeah.. 80 bucks sounds like nothing for 7 people, because it WASN’T—beer’s just THAT CHEAP in Hburgh).  Considering we pretty much all got hammered, of course you know some great catchphrases were born, some of which include:  -“More Cowbell”—from the famous Will Ferrell SNL skit for “Don’t Fear the Reaper.”  Basically, you can use it to describe what everything and anything in the world lacks. It’s become especially perfect to describe a less- than –attractive girl, “she could use about 6 more cowbells.” -“Good Enough for Government Work”—one of my favorites.  You use this to describe any girl just cute enough for you to consider taking home with you. -“TOUCHE!”  (must be accompanied with appropriate “throw your hands in the air” gesture)—stolen from Ben Stiller in Dodgeball, perfect for any situation where someone makes any strong point. Replacing such time-honored phrases as “good push” or “strong point”  Other great moments included my idea for the reality show “CASE RACE” where a 64-team field competes, tourney-style, in head-to-head Case Races. However, following the completion of the beer, the team still has to traverse an ELIMINATOR-style obstacle course.  Also, you’ve not lived until you driven through a SWANKY development with 6 people crammed into a Dodge Stratus at 3 AM, if only to set off a HUGE tube of fireworks.    All-in-all, it was a fantastic, whirlwind of a weekend, bringing us together at last. Although, all 8 of us were not together at once, because of our furious water bandit.  I’m sure I’ve forgotten a LOAD of funny stories and moments, but that’s what the “post a comment” link is for. I warn you, though, here in my Kingdom, NO ONE calls me “shermanator” without getting their post deleted.  Hope that worked for you, Marcus.  Everybody else, talk to you soon—Go Pubbers! (We’re inching our way towards the playoffs with a big game tonight) -apk

      Okee dokee, Banner-- that was a solid idea, but let's be honest, it's no contest between Soccer (a sport for guys who can't throw) and Football.  Instead, in honor of TONIGHT'S ALL-STAR GAME, I present yinz with TODAY'S POLL QUESTION!  "Who is the greatest all-around Major League Baseball Player of all time." by all-around, i'm talking 5-tools, you've got to include defense, throwing, running, etc., and Major League means Josh Gibson is DQ'd.  Perhaps he's the greatest player ever, but we'll never know-- there's no solid enough record of him. It sucks, but them's the breaks.  So fire away, kiddies!  First female to give a coherent thought on the subject earns 20 points on my "date matrix" and gets that much closer to the man of her dreams, namely: me.  -apk

      Greetings, friends!  Tuesday is now, and forever shall be, poll day! Since things got so fun thanks to Banner’s post last week, let’s try to keep the momentum rolling. For the rest of the day, I’ll be accepting ideas for polls.  Nothing else really going on of major note, today.  Last night I headed over to Damon’s in the Waterfront to meet the Lovebirds and watch the Home Run Derby.  Jeanie, I would’ve called you to come have a beer, but you’re already trying to replace me. So there.  The Derby did NOT disappoint, as Berkman and Tejada LIT UP Enron Field with many a monster shot to left-center.  Quite the entertaining little spectacle. I doubt it’ll live up to TONIGHT’S ALL-STAR GAME, though.  Especially since Kup and I are headed back to the Herminie Hacienda after work tonight in order to hook up my dad’s new 46 inches of television fury, so that we can witness the Midsummer Classic in glorious High Definition. Feel free to join us, if you’re in the area. Call before 5:30, and you can meet at my house in the Fo’ for a ride out to the Boonies.  Other big news yesterday included the Pubbers getting washed out when we were locked in an early 1-1 tie. We’ll be making it up with a double-dip on Sunday.  Early indications show that my hammy is at about 95%, so that’s encouraging.    Finally, my new Carbon Leaf album, “Indian Summer,” arrived yesterday, y’all can rush out to Barnes and Noble and pick it up starting today.  I’ll have some sort of biased review tomorrow, after I listen to it all day at work.  Early word is this: it’s VERY mellow, and a lot less rambunctiously Celtic and jammy than “echo, echo.”  They sound considerably more refined, and I’m thinking I dig it… stay tuned.   If you want a taste, go to carbonleaf.com, and find yourself the eCard under the “news” section.  They’ve got three tracks on there, all of which are pretty solid, especially, “What About Everything?”  The best song on the disc, though, is “One Prairie Outpost,” although, admittedly, I’m biased, because that’s been one of my favorite songs of theirs for over two years, now.  Okay, I’ve rambled enough for now. Post some ideas for a poll, and let’s get crazy—remember, It takes a village to build a Blog.  Much love, enjoy Tuesday -apk

      As promised, YOUR weekend recap!  Friday I took the day off and spent the morning/early afternoon with Kupchelitis cleaning up the house and   even cleaning my room!  So Nic finally arrived about 3-ish, we picked up my Tux and headed to the rehearsal dinner.  The dinner was course-by-course Italian family style, and we all ate WAY too much before heading to the church... which is where things got interesting.  During rehearsal, as my brother, Dan, my cousin, Monica, and I were hanging out in the Dawg Pound, cracking jokes and generally not paying attention (although it WAS cute that my sister cried so much she couldn't even PRACTICE her vows), a scrawny, (presumably) homeless man with long brown hair, and mathing beard made his way into the church.  While there, he bowed down to the Virgin Mother and did some sort of weird incantations.  It was then that we relized it: JESUS WAS IN ATTENDACE.  Obviously, He came to wish my sister and brother-in-law luck in their new life together, and provide them with His blessing.  Of course, he also talked to my brother in the lobby, and informed him that "marriage is tough... don't FUCK it up."  Words do not do this turn of events justice.  After all the fun and games, Nic and I headed back to the Fo' and hung out for a while, before heading over to Sprout's house to try out his new and fantastic Adecco Deck.  Much love to Sprout and the Mrs. for the beer, food, and hospitality.    Moving along, Saturday was a beautiful day for a wedding, so it was a good thing that we had one planned.  My diminuative sister looked positively beautiful, and all family members (my teary-self included) were able to pretty much hold it together throughout the festitivities.   My dad's hillbilly-movie went over particularly well. I caught the garter belt, and was lucky enough to place it onto the lovely Third-Reader Kristy.  Of course, a wonderful time was had with my supremely badass superdate and best friend, Nic, as well.    What can I say? I dont' remember a TON of specifics, because I was pretty hammered, but I do remember that nothing terrible happened, and everybody had a blast.  And the DJ was good, too.   So that, as they say, is that- let it never be said that Knors, Gaiches, and Dilldines can't get down.  happy Monday, y'all. -apk

      Howdy kids,  I'm finally back in the Fo' after a long day of traversing the cityscape with Nic, Kup, Wendi and Megan.  Highlights included ColdStone Creamery for the first time, and the two smokin'-hot blonde TWINS at Dave & Busters.  Film at Eleven (ie: details to follow about the rest of the weekend, tomorrow.)  Right now, it's time for CATCH PHRASE BATTLE OF THE SEXES: ROOMMATES v. ROOMMATES!  Undefeated Current Roommates Adam & Adam v. Former Roommates Wendi and Nicole in the BATTLE OF THE CENTURY!!!  stay tuned for results!  oh yeah, BENOIT RETAINED!  ..i'll talk about the immensely successful wedding tomorrow.  until then, Goodnight, moon.  -apk

       In the interest of fairness, I'm re-posting Uram's rebuttal to Bedison's stance on Fahrenheit 9/11.  However, there were short parts that I found to be inappropriate, which is why the original post was deleted.  I've taken the liberty to edit his post (BECAUSE THIS IS MY KINGDOM) to where it looks like this:  Here are some quotes from Jamie Bedison (regarding Fahrenheit 9/11) that need a little clarification:    “I agree that it is very biased and quite opinionated, but the facts are the facts.” I didn’t realize that using the phrases “very biased” and “quite opinionated” could be used in the same sentence as “the facts are the facts”.   “While Rumsfeld, Ashcroft and the rest of the evil empire conspires in their get-rich quick scheme of invading contries for profit we get the bill and the body count.”  1. Rumsfeld and Ashcroft don’t need any “get rich quick schemes”. They are already rich. 2. The Bush administration cannot be called the evil empire. The Red Sox already used that term to describe the New York Yankees. So, from now on, I will refer to the current administration as the YANKEES ADMINISTRATION.  3. “Invading countries for profit… we get the bill and the body count”. That is true, let’s get our troops out of Iraq and put Sadaam back in power. His body counts were no where near the body count of the Yankees Administration. Oh wait, RAPE ROOMS DON’T KILL PEOPLE!!! THEY JUST SHAME A WOMAN AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES!!! VOTE SADAAM… LESS DEAD, MORE RAPED.   “I could easily get behind an administration who I thought had the best interests of the citizens at large in mind, but it's not hard to wage a meaningless war when you can hit the links and escape the reality of it like these pompus asses do.”  1. How could this be a meaningless war? It’s a get rich quick scheme remember? 2. ..”can hit the links and escape the reality of it like these pompus asses do.” I don’t see a hippie facing any harsh realities of war, torture, or death. I see them escaping reality to a bigger extreme than golfing. Attention Liberal Hippies: DRUGS AND ALCOHOL MAKE YOU ESCAPE REALITY. I’d rather have a president that goes golfing instead of one that smokes hash, throws his medals away, and betrays the same soldiers that he not only served with, but that protected his life.   “Meanwhile we have cemented our title as the biggest a-holes in the world in the past few decades.”  1. Wow, I suppose the Texas Rangers are the reason America is full of a-holes. (whoa, that one went over Bedison’s head). 2. I didn’t realize that the Yankees Administration has been in power since at least 1984.  3. The world liked us better when our president shoved cigars up the asses of fat chicks.     “I didn't just like the movie because it's an 80 minute embarassment of W's "policies", ok that really is the reason that I like it...anything that calls Bush out on the dillwad that he is gets a thumbs up in my book...”  1. Wow, a full length movie that is 1 hour 20 minutes… Michael Moore is a true genius. The movie was over 6 hours long, but he edited out the factual parts where it’s an actual DOCUMENTARY.  2. I got one word that calls out Kerry for the “dillwad” that HE is: BOTOX.   “Either way, you can find me diligently hunting for wmd's and paying taxes for a war I can't believe that we are in.......Kerry/Edwards '04!”  Conclusion: VOTE AGAINST THE YANKEES ADMINISTRATION!! TURN THAT SOLDIER BODY COUNT INTO A PILE OF PARTIALLY BORN ABORTED BABIES.   REMOVE OUR TROOPS FROM IRAQ TO TELL THOSE TERRORISTS “I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I… AND IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE. AND STICKS AND STONES CAN BREAK MY BONES BUT….. SO CAN BURNING PLANES AND CRASHING TOWERS. WHERE ARE THE WMDs?? THEY ARE IN SYRIA SO QUIT BITCHING.   Bottom Line… I’m not going to tell you to vote for Bush. I am just saying that before you liberals turn on your own president in the most hateful, partisan, most personally attacking way in the history of the United States, look at what you want to replace him… its pretty pathetic.   ONE NATION..UNDER GOD..WITH LIBERTY.. AND JUSTICE FOR ALL

      I'm not going to write a ton today, because I'm in an odd emotional place, and don't really want to explore.  TONIGHT IS SKYBLAST! the MOTHER of all fireworks displays. More on it tomorrow.  Playoffs start tonight in the DNL: Pubbers v. South Hills in round one. I'm still out, and probably more likely to be on the 15-day, than be listed as day-to-day.  The weekend's shaping up nicely: Skyblast tonight, Game&nbsp;2 and party at Sprout's tomorrow, probably my first Bucco game with Gavin on Sunday.&nbsp; Monday will be HUGE also: Game 3 (Pubbers try to clinch) and RAW IS WAR at Mellon with my DREAM MATCH main eventing. More info on  that  over the weekend. (stay tuned for my Jerry is God post).  well, kiddies, that's about it for now. Comments have slowed, so i've added a sitemeter to track how much traffic the Kingdom actually gets.&nbsp; I hope you're out there, cuz the fun's just starting.  until next time I remain, -apk

       The Irrelevant Mailbag is filling up! Keep those questions, comments, and queries coming!&nbsp; In the meantime, I present for your amusement a sampling of the random thoughts circling through my brain this week.&nbsp;   “100% of the shots you don’t make don’t go in.” is probably the best quote I’ve heard by someone I undeniably despise.   I don’t think there’s a more hit or miss comedy show on TV these days than “Reno 911.”&nbsp; I never take the time to find out when it’s on, because half the time&nbsp; it’s not funny, but when it’s funny, it’s   FUNNY  .  If there’s a better sportswriter on the planet today than Bill Simmons ( urlLink http://www.sportsguy.net/ ), I’ve not read him.&nbsp; Check out his new “Vengeance Scale,” pure hilarity.&nbsp; He even confirms what we’ve long suspected: Justin Timberlake is every guy’s hero, whether we know it our not.   I&nbsp;can’t believe I just wrote that last sentence.   Ashlee Simpson must be stopped.&nbsp; I can’t understand how I can be so simultaneously mesmerized and annoyed by one person. (this is a whole column waiting to happen). Try and watch six minutes of her show, I dare you-- there's no way this show can be turned off once someone starts watching it.&nbsp;  Do you think Kris Benson runs on batteries, or do they just plug him into the same wall socket as Al Gore?   How sad it is that I remember why “Chrissy Seaver” from Growing Pains was named “Chrissy Seaver” (in show continuity)?   I wish that it was acceptable to shout “I lovvvvvvvvve being a TURTLE!” every time something good happened to you.   I can’t explain it, but I REALLY like the band Yellowcard. Commence Laughter.   Are there two more underrated sports movies than “Major League II” and “Necessary Roughness?”   Who makes road signs? Like, who wakes up one day and says, “I’m going to start the nation’s largest road sign-making company! It is my DESTINY!”   And finally, because no one asked:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE TOP 7 HARRISON FORD MOVIES  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) The Empire Strikes Back  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Raiders of the Lost Ark  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Star Wars (“episode IV”) / Return of the Jedi  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Hollywood Homicide (KIDDING!)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Apocalypse Now  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6)&nbsp;The Fugitive&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7)&nbsp;Air Force One&nbsp;   Thanks, you’ve been great.

      Greetings chums,  I'll keep this short, because Wednesday is Uram's day in these parts (if you've not checked it out yet, scroll down and read the first installment of "Going Postal," it's a solid debut, and I'm happy to have him here to stoke the flames of conversation).  Anyhoo, I've got a trip to the hospital in line for this evening to get the foot X-Rayed.&nbsp; I'm REALLY hoping a spider gets mixed up in the radiation process, or maybe I have some chromosomes mutated and develop an X-Factor.&nbsp; Then I could zip around in my dad's car, wear black leather, and fight crime.&nbsp; That would be pret-ty cool.  Hope everyone's coping with hump day in their own special way.&nbsp; Despite my injury, I'm still riding high thanks to Rob Mackowiak's 2-run Homerun last night that he hit because I was in the stands. If you're scoring at home, he's hit 3 for me in 6 games this year.&nbsp; Yes, I was wearing my homemade Mackowiak t-shirt in the crowd, and thoroughly enjoyed my 17 seconds of fame as the boys referred to me as "The President of the Fanclub."&nbsp; It's the little things that count.  I'm going to run along and finally finish this brief now, in the meantime, prepare yourselves for some random thoughts and fun.&nbsp; I'm also going to send a call out for two things:&nbsp;   1) more birthday ideas. I really don't know what to do for it; and  2) SEND ME QUESTIONS! the more inane the better! want to know what I think the top 7 Harrison Ford movies are of all time? I'll tell you! Really, this could be fun-- send me a question, and I'll do a 'mailbag' style answer-post. It'll spark some conversation, and we can have some more fun around here.&nbsp; If you don't know my email address, you shouldn't be here.  Finally, I'd like to give shout-outs to Kujo and Kelly, who I recently learned visit the Kingdom.&nbsp; If you've been around here, and I've not said hello and given props, the POST! and let me know that you've joined the family.  Remember, it takes a village.. blah blah. -apk (i guess that wasn't so short.. sorry 'Lex)

      Before I start let me say, THIS IS NOT A RESEARCHED COMPREHENSIVE THESIS.&nbsp; It’s a column on a blog.&nbsp; So anything I say, feel free to comment, but don’t give me whiney hippie crap complete with footnotes and a bibliography because I will just print the response and burn it.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Why is this called “GOING POSTAL”?&nbsp; Because I am a casual carrier for the United States Postal Service and I contemplate the use of an Uzi every single moment I am at work.&nbsp; For everyone who thinks being a mailman is easy, give yourself a paper cut.&nbsp; That will teach you not to mess with the post office.&nbsp; I have to walk miles upon miles every day, fighting off dogs as well as old people at the brink of death whose only satisfaction in life is to alert the summer fill-in mailman that their mail usually comes at 10:30, not 10:45.&nbsp; Attention Nursing homes:&nbsp; RECRUIT HARDER.&nbsp; But anyway, this one of only a few times I will ever discuss the post office or my job in general.&nbsp; I will mostly be commenting on things that are so apocalyptically doucheful (Not always politics), that they would spiral any normal person into rage.&nbsp; But from what I’ve been reading, the followers of this blog are mostly tree hugging, showerless, drug addicted liberals who love Michael Moore, Gandhi, and France.&nbsp; Just so you know, I DO NOT HATE DEMOCRATS. &nbsp;I HATE HIPPIES.&nbsp; And for the record, I define myself as a moderate republican.&nbsp; I like the military, guns and tax cuts, but I also HATE CENSORSHIP and civil rights violations.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  With that said, this leads me to my main topic of the first ever going postal:&nbsp; The undercard of singing divas, the name lost in the bright lights of Diana Ross, Gladys Night, Dionne Warwick, and Cher:&nbsp; LINDA RONSTADT.&nbsp; I hate her so bad, that if I had to deliver her mail, I would take her credit card bills and burn them so she would get late fees and overage charges. &nbsp;Then I would take her favorite magazine subscription and put it at the bottom of the pile of mail that has to be delivered to her street.&nbsp; This would mean that the magazine will have to rest directly on my sweat drenched forearm.&nbsp; Suck on that Linda…. Your  Entertainment Weekly  is soaked and ripped.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  First of all, a lot of people don’t realize this but, LINDA RONSTADT IS WHITE.&nbsp; She has no soul, no rhythm, and no talent.&nbsp; I can fart on tune better than she can sing.&nbsp; Linda Ronstadt is the original Wigger.&nbsp; She started out as a white trash folk hippie priestess and tried to become a soulful diva.&nbsp; EEEEEEERRRR.&nbsp; WRONG ANSWER.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her most famous song that she didn’t steal from Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and everyone else including FIVAL the mouse was “Different Drum”.&nbsp; It is so great that hearing her sing this song live is worth the price of admission alone.&nbsp; WAIT A SECOND.&nbsp; I’D MAKE HER PAY ME TO LISTEN TO THIS HORRIBLE SONG. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Linda Ronstadt ended up inspiring such greats as Vanilla Ice, House of Pain, and Eminem.&nbsp; Wow, that’s great company.&nbsp; Where am I going with this?&nbsp; Well it’s not hard to figure out, that Linda is a supreme hippie liberal douche.&nbsp; She is a frigid Ice Cow who can only be sexually aroused by Michael Moore tales of Fiction.&nbsp; Now, I have read the reviews of this film (I refuse to go see it and give Michael Moore any of my money) and the reviews are very positive.&nbsp; The New York Times, the most famous newspaper in the world LOVED THIS MOVIE and will probably print a transcript of it for their front page.&nbsp; (I wonder where the political views of this “non-biased” newspaper lie.)&nbsp; After watching CNN, and reading The NY TIMES, I would have thought that ALL OF AMERICA was praising Michael Moore.&nbsp; That’s until I found a buried, back page news story that needs some exposure.&nbsp; I guess all of America is not singing the praises of Michael Moore.&nbsp; During a Las Vegas concert, over the hill singer Linda Ronstadt (of whom I discussed earlier) called Michael Moore a “true patriot” among other praises.&nbsp; She then dedicated the song “Desperado” (a song she stole) to Mr. Moore.&nbsp; Cnn.com writes,     That dedication angered some Aladdin (Casino) guests who spilled drinks, tore down posters and demanded their money back, said casino spokeswoman Sara Gorgon.  "We had quite a scene at the box office," she said.  About a quarter of the 4,500 people in the audience got up and left before the performance had finished    If that was at the Oscars, or in San Francisco, the crowd would have gone wild!&nbsp; OH THEY WENT WILD ALL RIGHT.&nbsp; THEY BOOED HER HIPPIE ASS RIGHT OFF THE STAGE.&nbsp; NOT ONLY DID THEY BOO HER, BUT MANY WALKED OUT, AND THE CONCERT WAS CANCELLED.&nbsp; WHEN LINDA RETURNED TO HER ROOM IN THE SAME LAS VEGAS CASINO, THE KEY DIDN’T WORK AND SHE WAS INFORMED THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER WELCOME IN THIS CASINO.  WOW I DIDN’T EXPECT THIS FROM THE SAME AMERICA WHICH HAS KERRY WINNING BY A LANDSLIDE.&nbsp; THE SAME AMERICA THAT HATES THEIR MORON PRESIDENT AND WANTS A “REGIME CHANGE”&nbsp; THIS ISN’T THE PROPER BEHAVIOR OF A LEFT WING HIPPIE LIBERAL DOUCHE!!! &nbsp;I GUESS AMERICANS AREN’T AS PISSED OFF AT BUSH AS CNN WOULD SUGGUEST.&nbsp; AND I GUESS MICHAEL MOORE ISN’T AS PRAISED AND WELCOMED AS THE NY TIMES WOULD SUGGEST.&nbsp; EAT SHIT LINDA RHONSTAT.&nbsp; EAT SHIT LIBERALS.&nbsp; EAT SHIT AMERICA’S SOURCE FOR LEFT WING OPINIONATED NON-JOURNALISM: THE NEW YORK TIMES.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Well, that’s it for this week.&nbsp; I think that no matter what I said in this first column, we can ALL agree that LINDA RONSTADT SUCKS. Anyway, I’m sick of politics so next Wednesday I’ll talk about TV commercials that piss me off and should piss you off too.&nbsp;   ATTENTION LARA AND THE REST OF THE HIPPIES WHO READ THIS:&nbsp; AGAIN, THIS IS A HALF-ASSED, COMICAL COLUMN ON A BLOG.&nbsp; DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WRITING A 20 PAGE COMREHENSIVE RESEARCH ESSAY COMPLETE WITH A WORKS CITED PAGE, AND A TRANSCRIPT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH SOMEONE IMPORTANT THAT AGREES WITH YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anyway, see you next week, unless Nips fires me.  -Uram

      Hey kiddies, welcome to the show! &nbsp; Here in the Kingdom, we're always looking for ways to expand and become more entertaining than just my random ramblings about the Wendy's Guy, or Ashlee Simpson (rant on why SHE must be stopped, soon).&nbsp; If you've noticed, i said "we" there.&nbsp; Well, that's because I've recently inked an big-time, up-and-coming, column-writing bastion of hilariousness to a 4-year, $9 million deal (with beer and twinkie incentives)!&nbsp; Ladies and gentleman, as King and Supreme Commander of My Irrelevant Blog, I am proud to announce to you the signing of Alexander Uram as our new Wednesday Columnist. &nbsp; You may know him from that "Barry Bonds created a clone of his clone" comment last week, or as "The Guy with the Metal Pot" at Dickinson Ice Hockey Games.&nbsp; Most of you probably loved him as the AWF's resident Icon, "Saturated Fat."&nbsp; In any event, you've probably laughed at his antics at least once in your life.&nbsp; If you haven't, get ready to.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Alex grew up in a small town, but is a large man. Large in vision. Larger than life. And Largest in hilarity.&nbsp; With a rapier wit, an over-the-top style, and an over-opinionated style, I am certain that his columns will either make you laugh, cry, or get pissed.&nbsp; He's pretty much got free-reign to talk about whatever he likes (however, I WILL use the John Ashcroft Smackdown of Censorship when needed).&nbsp; Currently working for the US Postal Service, his column will, rightly enough be entitled "Going Postal with Uram."&nbsp; The first installment will be up tomorrow, and I hope that you enjoy his time with all of us. &nbsp; As for today's poll, it's a giffy.&nbsp; Jeanie kindly reminded me today that my birthday is a mere TWELVE DAYS AWAY, and I have no idea what to do for it. So here's your poll: &nbsp; "What should Adam do for his birthday?"  &nbsp; throw a party? what kind?  get drunk? where? score? :) with whom? &nbsp; you know where to click- now get to it! i love you all, -apk

       urlLink CNN.com - Schwarzenegger's 'girlie men' line under fire - Jul 19, 2004   Okay, I'm a Democrat.  A moderate liberal with Hippie leanings of my own, but this is frickin' ridiculous. You can't say ANYTHING without pissing off SOMEBODY these days, and it's starting to get annoying.  Anyway(s),   I   feel like a "girlie man" today, with the way I'm gimping around, trying to keep weight off of my right foot.  As I beat out a double play ball yesterday, I landed HARD on the base with my right heel.  I don't know how, or what happened, but it feels like someone hit my heel with a hammer. I can't stand on it. I can't walk on it. DRIVING MY CAR hurt yesterday.  Needless to say, I'm a little concerned about being able to be ready for the playoffs.  The weekend was mostly dedicated to baseball.  However, I did have a lovely time hanging out with the lovely Kristy on Friday, and a lovely time with the lovely Jeanie on Saturday.  Has anyone else out there ever experienced baked beans with apples in them?? Because they're oddly tasty...  Meanwhile, life remains relatively uninteresting for another day. I've got a HUGE announcement about the next step in the growth of the Kingdom coming up tomorrow. So stay tuned! (and pray for my foot.)  -apk

      Hi kids.  Sorry for the late update today, I’ve just found that I’ve really got nothing to say today.  I was going to stand up, like a man’s man, and defend Lara’s honor, but she told me to “suck it” today.  Therefore, she’ll will not be defended by me.  Harsh, you say?   Au contraire , my friends, for lest ye forget, this is MY KINGDOM, and she should be grateful that I didn’t just hands-down block her IP address, thus banning her from here forever.  Yes, I’m in one of  those moods .  The kind where I get overwhelmingly melodramatic, and say things like, “lest ye forget, this is MY KINGDOM.”  I apologize, friends.  I think it’s because my birthday’s coming up Sunday.  I’m the rather introspective type, and lately, have being taking stock of the year that was.  I’m not going to get sappy, depressing, or sentimental, but let’s just say that things could be better/ things could be worse.   I think that’s why I fit into Kup’s “it’s my birthday, let’s party” category.  I always find that the two times a year I get most introspective are right around my birthday and New Years.  I suppose they’re both “mile markers” of sorts, and lead to reflection on time past, victories won, and balls dropped.  All in all, maybe I especially love a good party on the first of Jan and Aug because it makes for a good distraction, or a tangible reminder of the good things in life.  So as I wrap up this subdued, slightly morose entry, I'd just like to take a minute to thank each and every one of you for being my friend.  I certainly know I’d never make it without any of you.  I’ll have a weekend recap sometime Sunday or Monday—it should be great times the next three days!  Much love, -apk

      Well friends, I’ve returned, I hope you enjoyed Uram’s column yesterday as much as I did.  Before I get started, I’d to give two quick shout-outs to loyal visitors AliMac and Poison Ivy.&nbsp; Ivy is especially surprising, because he’s stationed in Maine for the Navy, and I talk to him all too rarely. Great to know that they’re reading me all the way up North&nbsp;in Canadia.  Now, onto the show.  This one’s been brewing for a while, folks, and I was pushed over the edge last night.&nbsp; I had experienced a vastly entertaining evening with Kup and Jeanie in the Waterfront, drinkin’ beers, eating the World’s Largest Piece of Chocolate Cake, and taking in the “Bourne Supremacy” (solid flick- if you liked the first one, check it out).&nbsp; Upon returning to my humble abode, I noticed that Lara (of  Going Postal  fame) had added these frightful words to her Instant Messenger profile:  “Buy the new Ashlee Simpson CD!”  ..and that’s when it happened: I lost ALL respect for Lara.  Okay, I’ll admit it, I’m not one to talk about music tastes.&nbsp; My love of Huey Lewis, Hootie & the Blowfish, etc, is oft mocked and lamented, especially by Jeanie.&nbsp; But ASHLEE SIMPSON? Even  I’M  qualified to take some shots at  HER  music.&nbsp; Who knows? it MIGHT actually even be good, entertaining music.&nbsp; As I like to call it: “Music that never hurt anyone.” However, it’s the principle of the thing that’s the problem, here.   First off, let’s discuss “The Ashlee Simpson” show on MTV.&nbsp; Not only is she the WHINIEST GIRL EVER, but the show is also centered on the following premise:    Jessica Simpson’s little sister, stuck firmly in that place in life where you feel that everything your feeling is not only entirely original, but also of intergalactic importance, has decided to take voice lessons, get a band, and cut a record.&nbsp; We’ll follow her insignificant relationship with Guitar Guy (a rant for another time) through the trials and tribulations of 19 year-old angst (he didn’t sing me my song! WHINE!) as she writes songs about how the earth spins on its axis for he and he alone! All the while, she’ll tell us how she doesn’t want to be compared to her sister, and live in her shadow, and she’ll  DYE HER HAIR  to prove it! However, though she wants to stay out of Jessica’s shadow, she’ll   1) have a reality show on the same network  2) appear in all of her commercials (did anyone actually realize she’s in the “Buffalo Wing Chicken” commercial before the show?)  3) enter the exact same profession and  4) have her on the show as often as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Wow, I can’t believe I haven’t been fired for blaspheming the hippie bible that is Atom13’s BLOGSPOT.&nbsp; First off, Special thanks to Bruce Banner for being a huge pussy and not having the guts to respond to my first column.&nbsp; Obviously he was so devastated by the supreme verbal holocaust that I committed on hippies that he decided to gouge his own eyes out.&nbsp; Good going Doctor.&nbsp; However, in an online conversation with Dr. Banner, he did bring up a good point.&nbsp; THE BLOGSPOT NEEDS MORE PERSONAL SHIT HOUSING.&nbsp; So with that suggestion noted, I start my column:  NO LARA, I WILL NOT MAKE OUT WITH YOU.&nbsp; If you read the comments to last week’s column, you saw that Lara (The Supreme Comandress of all Hippies) is fully and madly in love with me.&nbsp; She is completely obsessed with becoming my wife.&nbsp; She won’t stop calling me, IMing me, and sending me cookies, hot croissants, and RC cola.&nbsp; Sorry Lara, but RC cola is not the elixir that will cure my heart from despising disgusting left wing liberals like you.&nbsp; Anyway, time for the MEAT (suck on that vegans) of my column:&nbsp;   COMMERCIALS THAT ARE SO ERRONIOUSLY DISGUSTING THAT THEY SHOULD ENRAGE YOU TO A POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO POSTAL.&nbsp;   When the average person watches TV, they see certain commercials that are funny, stupid, or just get their point across making you want to buy their product or service.&nbsp; Every now and then (more common than not)&nbsp; there comes along commercials so horrible, that you either vow to never buy the company’s product, or you long for the days of the old commercials that were better.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Commercial #1:&nbsp; MR. WENDY, UNOFFICIAL SPOKESMAN. There is no limit to how bad I would destroy this man’s mail if I was his regular mailman.&nbsp; The premise of this commercial is sound.&nbsp; A man who loves Wendy’s so much that he goes around acting like their spokesman but really isn’t.&nbsp; Wow, that sounds clever and potentially successful.&nbsp; To bad they found the supreme chancellor of douche to be Mr. Wendy.&nbsp; Then the most grievous sin against humanity occurred:&nbsp; THE FUSION OF DOUCHE AND POETRY.&nbsp; &nbsp;It all came to a head with his “chicken strips salad soliloquy”.&nbsp; Mr. Wendy proceeded to butcher a medieval English accent using the words “Thy” and “Doth” in the same sentence as “For shizzle”.&nbsp; THAT MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE MY GUTS OUT UNTIL BILE IS THE ONLY THING LEFT EXPELLING FROM MY INSIDES.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are ever in the car listening to the radio, and the “CHICKEN STRIPS SALAD SOLILOQUY” comes on, do yourself a favor. Swerve the car off the road, over the guard rail and into a ditch.&nbsp; The car will probably explode thus making the radio shut off. Man, I wish Jesus was still around.&nbsp; So he could resurrect DAVE THOMAS FOUNDER OF WENDY’S.&nbsp; And Dave and J.C. together can kick the crap out of MR. WENDY, unofficial spokesman, official scumbag.  Commercial #2:&nbsp; ARE YOU GELLIN’?&nbsp; LIKE A FELLON.&nbsp; I’m pretty sure no felons are using Dr. Scholl’s gel inserts in their prison boots.&nbsp; The only gel being used by felons is KY jelly during a daily ass rape of the Cell Block’s bitch (Probably Mr. Wendy).&nbsp; ARE YOU GELLIN?&nbsp; Like MAGELLAN.&nbsp; WOW, the key to Circumnavigating the world in a 16th century galleon is to WEAR DR. SCHOLL’S GEL INSERTS.&nbsp; No wonder many other explorers failed to accomplish the feat before MA “GELLIN LIKE A FELLON” did it in 1522.&nbsp; Eat shit Dr. Scholl’s.&nbsp; Columbus did something cooler and he was wearing inserts made by your rival: ACE Bandages.&nbsp;   Commercial #3.&nbsp; THE MOST ENRAGING COMMERCIAL IN THE HISTORY OF EXISTENCE:&nbsp; RIP, SLIP, BRUSH, AAH.&nbsp; THAT’S RIGHT, ORAL B’S BRUSH UPS.&nbsp; This product is a disposable sponge laced with toothpaste that fits over your finger.&nbsp; Its purpose is so you can brush your teeth when you are on the go.&nbsp; TOO BAD THE ONLY REQUIREMENT TO USING THIS PRODUCT IS 5 YEARS JAZZ TAP AND 3 YEARS CHOREOGRAPHED BROADWAY DANCING EXPERIENCE.&nbsp; ORAL B got a dozen out of work off off off off off off off off OFF Broadway, talentless, wanna-be’s to perform Oral B Brush-UP: THE 30 SECOND DOUCHICAL.&nbsp; If you have never seen this commercial, please try to see it because it is the biggest display of everything I hate in existence.&nbsp; They get these (can’t use the word I want) people to sing and dance around their office building so happy and refreshed that they brushed the front their teeth with a one time use brillo pad with some toothpaste on it.&nbsp; They dance around in sequence chanting “RIP, SLIP, BRUSH, AAH”&nbsp; yeah I said the same thing:&nbsp; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHGHGHGHGHGHHGGH GET THIS HIPPIE OKLAHOMA DISNEY CRAP OFF MY TELEVISION RIGHT NOW BEFORE I BURN DOWN ORAL B HEADQUARTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;   Ok…. Gotta calm down….&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 2 1….. 1 2 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; what the heck… is bothering me?  ORAL GOD DAMN B BRUSH UPS!!! RIP SLIP BRUSH, AGUGUGGHGHGHGHHGHH!!!!&nbsp; I HAVE A BETTER METHOD TO ACCOMPLISHING ORAL B’S GOALS.&nbsp; Neuse, slip, jump, choke.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Anyway, that is all for this week.&nbsp; Next week:&nbsp; THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION review and also an NFL preview the likes of can only be found on GOING POSTAL.&nbsp;   HOLD MY DRINK BITCH. &nbsp;-URAM

      As has become Tuesday custom here, it’s poll time! I was having a hard time coming up with something today, and then I remembered a short conversation that Kup and I had last night while eating dinner with the lovely Dempster girls, Megan and Shannon, before the Pirates game.&nbsp; I was praising Mase’s triumphant return to rap/hip hop with the song “Welcome Back,” which stylishly samples the theme to “Welcome Back, Kotter” (one of the best TV themes of all times), when I summarily said it’s “pretty much the best rap song ever.”&nbsp; Kup, ever the stringent linguist, pulled a Drew and lambasted me by saying, “that’s giving it a little too much credit, Burrows.” “Well played, Youngblood,” I thought to myself, as I explained that it was simply a figure of speech.&nbsp; Anyway(s), that leads us to today’s poll.   What’s your favourite rap/hip hop song of all times?   This is tough for me, as I truly don’t listen to a lot of rap/hip hop, but when I hear something I like, I REALLY like it.&nbsp; I’ll save my pick for later, you guys, though—chime in NOW! Operators are standing by.  While you’re at it, send along some birthday ideas.&nbsp; It’s looking more and more as though I’m going to “keep it simple, stupid,” save my limited funds for Kujo’s wedding next week, and just have a small cookout among friends. And when I say small, I mean SMALL.&nbsp; I just don’t have it in me to throw a big blast right now. However, it’s my birthday, and Burgers and Beruit are always a good time.  Finally, it warrants mentioning that Shannon Dempster is an evil girl who ruined my childhood as a Braves fan, and then ruined my winning streak AND my Monday night last night by continuing to be a Braves fan.&nbsp; Props to the PNC Park Jumbotron Krew, though, for using Yellowcard’s “Only One” as the soundtrack to a weekend Buccos montage.&nbsp; It won’t change that song’s place in my heart, but they made a damn good run at it.  Anywho, Shake Yo’ Tailfeather and Lose Yourself, cuz Mama Said Knock You Out if you don’t answer the poll.  Much love, -apk&nbsp;

      Guess who’s back? Back again? Knipper’s back, tell a friend…  Hi friends, welcome back to the Kingdom. Did you miss me? I didn’t think so, thanks to the lack of questions and queries in my inbox. I’m a little disappointed the Irrelevant Mailbag idea has not caught on, because I think it could have made things a little more interactive, and a little more fun.&nbsp; This blog exists for TWO reasons: 1) so I can write. 2) so yinz can have fun, n’at.&nbsp; I just wanted to create a place where we can talk about random stuff and take some shots at each other. Sort of like a cyber-lunchtable. If I’ve said it once, friends, I’ve said it a thousand times, “It’s takes a village to build a blog.” So get those comments rolling! I know you’re out there!  Anyway(s), this was a GRAND weekend. For starters, it saw the return of the Lumber Company to Pittsburgh’s North Shore!&nbsp; Not only did the Buccos sweep the Redlegs, but they’re quickly approaching .500, and respectability.&nbsp; It’s fun being a Pirates fan for the first time in a long time. Sure, they’re not going to win EVERY game, but now when you head to the Most Beautiful Ballpark in the Known Universe, you’ve got a great shot at seeing real-life Major League Baseball for the first time in about 10 years.  Before I go off TOO much on the Bucs, I want to quickly recommend that NO ONE EVER MISS a “Skyblast.”&nbsp; Simply put, it’s an amazing experience. After a Pirates game, they set off about a half hour or so’s worth of fireworks from: barges on the river, platforms in the stadium, the Roberto Clemente Bridge, and THE TOP OF THE USX BUILDING (ie: the “Tallest Building between NYC and Chicago).&nbsp; In between volleys of pyrotechnics, there are skits and light shows and random insanity. If there’s one thing you ever take from this blog, let it be this: NEVER MISS SKYBLAST. Rant over.  Party at Sprout’s was as fun as can be expected. Special Kingdom shout-out to Elise’s stripper shoes—the highlight of my week.&nbsp;   Also, thanks to Gavin for sweet-ass Bucco seats as I watched them win twice in one weekend.&nbsp; Special notice of awesomeness to my boy, Rob Mackowiak (THE MACK OF ALL TRADES) for coming up with a PH game-winning double as a gift to his fan club (Gav and I) in attendance.  And FINALLY, Kudos to George Lucas for not screwing up and officially naming Episode III: REVENGE OF THE SITH.&nbsp; The PERFECT title, especially for Star Wars geeks that know the story behind why “Return of the Jedi” got its name. If you don’t know—all you gotta do is MAIL THE IRRELEVANT MAILBAG!! (see how I draw everything together in one nice, little bow?)  Okee Dokee, that should suffice for now, I suppose.  Tune in for next time when we find out the answer to “is Adam going to Raw tonight? Or not?”  Go Pubbers! (1-1 against South Hills: Game 3 tonight) -much love, apk

        CONGRATULATIONS KUJO & DARIELLE!    This is gonna be quick, friends.  I'm headed out the door to head home early so I can pack quickly, get a new Driver's License, and then head off to the Kujo & Darielle Wedding in lovely... New Jersey. I'll reserve snide remarks, cuz we're gonna be on the beach! I'll be the guy blinding everyone with his pasty-whiteness. I swear, I look like a bottle of White-Out.  Anywho, I need a quick 2-day vacation following the funkadelicness of this past week.  I'm just going to throw a blanket apology out there to everyone I was moody with earlier this week. Odds are I've apologized to you at least once already, and will probably continue to apologize for it, cuz, well, i don't take embarassment well and when I feel badly, I feel REALLY badly.  anyways, dinner's in the fridge! I'll take you yinz on Monday. -apk

      G’mornin’ everyone.   Recently, Ernst recommended that every day have a column title and specific theme, an Idea which I had already been mulling.  My problem was that I couldn’t come up with any good ideas for the Thursday column. Well, that’s what friends are for, I guess.  Grampy Stuab threw out a great idea: a retrospective tale of yore recounting golden memories of days gone by. And he suggested I make you laugh.   Make you laugh? Uram’s the specialist, there. I’m just the guy who uses big words and waxes melodramatically about Spider-Man 2.  But I’ll do my best.  So, after thinking about it, I realized that this is a REALLY good idea.  Not only will it give me a chance to practice my narrative writing, but it’ll also (hopefully) be a little entertaining. Those are the two goals of this here blog, so let’s try it out and see how it works!  As an added bonus, those of you out there who DIDN’T know me in college might learn a thing or two about me and my friends, and what made us the upstanding champions of beer and justice that we are today.  And maybe you’ll laugh, too. Who knows?  In a nutshell, the people have spoken, and I have listened! You’re all VERY fortunate that I’m a loving god, and not a vengeful one. So without further ado, I present to you the first installment of Thursday’s new column: BOWS & TOES!  For those of you unfamiliar with the exercise known as “bows & toes,” allow me to illustrate. Bows &amp; Toes is the cornerstone of pledging calisthenics.  All good pledges know how to do them. First, assume a “push up position.” Now, instead of propping yourself up with your hands/arms, lock your hands behind your head and use your elbows to hold yourself parallel with the ground.  Then take your right foot, and cross it over your left foot. Now keep your ass down, and your back straight.  And hold it….(I DIDN’T SAY GET UP!)….Congratulations! You’re in pain!  For added fun, try it on concrete sometime.  ..okay, Get up…  Just thinking about the words “bows & toes!” rolling off of Scott Hart’s tongue take me back to a simpler time.  A time where all you had in your pocket was four quarters, a condom, a Halex, and a Bic lighter. Oh, those were the days. A different theme party every week, food runs, and study hours.  Kup took a shot at Dom’s record, Natalie spent her evenings at Phi Kap, and I even scored a couple of times.  Of course, I’m talking about that year of years, sophomore year at my alma mater, the Big Dick.   Eight young men had come together with a purpose, and we were determined to succeed. That purpose: get drunk. Okay, not really, it was to buy our friends. Alright, I'm kidding, relax.  Remind me to get into fratguy sterotype-bashing mode some other time.  Our purpose: to become the best pledge class to ever make it through.  And get some play.  On to the show!   By “we,” I mean D-Generation OX, my pledge class.  A quick rundown of the cast of characters, using nicknames to protect the innocent.   Buff :  The self-described leader of the group. A Big man with a Big heart, and a semi-functioning brain.  A master tactician and motivator, he was our inspiration.   Heed :  The guy with the big head. Even though mine’s bigger.  Suave and debonaire, he was our resident James Bond.  Or, more accurately, Dirk Benedict. He was the Faceman. A lady killer and leader in his own right. Everyone knows that, though. What few know is that, like his Big Brother Bruce Banner, he was a powderkeg/headcase all the way through pledging. Always on edge. Not good.   Me : You know me, you love me. Or you wouldn’t be here. I’m sort of the runt of this particular litter. But I’m the runt with the heart of gold. The runt with the heart of gold and the emotional inferiority complexes.  I tried to keep things lose through self-deprecating humour, often to little success.   Jewbacca :  The hairiest guy I’ve ever known. He was the superpledge that knew all the information we had to learn first. He always took everything WAY too seriously, but somebody had to.   The Wop :  The little Italian rugger. Known also as MightyMouse, he takes inferiority complexes to a whole new level. Hell bent on making the most money and proving that he’s the Little Rambler that Could, back then he was just concentrating on having rock-hard abs and not having other frat guys Shivers his girlfriend’s timbers.   Durty :  The crazy semi-Canuck who’ll do anything for a laugh.  At that time, he was hardwired to his roommate, The Wop, who had near total control over him.  Not a bad thing, but the truth’s the truth.  When you roll with Durty, hilarity always ensued.  Of special note that he was my twinstar, as we shared the same Big Brother.   The Frog :  At the time, I only really knew the Frog as ‘the dumb kid from Comp Sci class.’  By the time I was finished pledging, I knew him as ‘the dumb kid from pledging.’ Now, I know him as ‘the dumb kid with the chef for a dad.’ He’s the only kid I’ve ever met that’s lazier than I am, and that’s saying something.  He’s a sweetheart, though, and is actually really witty, if you give him time to plan his jokes in advance.  And finally, today's star,   AWOL :  Okay, so you’ve got a highly decorated Army reservist in your pledge class, this should be cake for him, right?  He should have no problems taking orders or learning stuff or getting yelled at, right? WRONG. When he was actually there, he was freezing on the line. Take for instance, this exchange during “alphabet practice,” which I’ll give as today’s story, since this column’s already too too long.  We’re in the basement of the Sketch House, trying to go home.  The Sketch House was our off-campus crackhouse where a few of our senior brothers lived.  Nesteled in the semi-sketchy part of town, it was a great place for parties and new-member education.  Basically, the place was a a hellhole, but it was OUR hellhole.  Anywho, we’d been there for a lonnng time, and it’d been a wretched night, because we can’t get the alphabet right.  This is where we had to go one by one down the line taking turns saying a single letter of the Greek Alphabet.  If we finally get it right, showing an ability to know the alphabet and work as a team, and we do it quickly, we get to go home. Well, every. Single. Time. We get to AWOL on “Omicron” he screws up and says, “O-MY-cron.” And all the brothers laugh at us. Bows & Toes ensue.  Hopefully I can express the humour in this situation. AWOL’s a pretty prideful cat.  He’s the kind of guy that’s never made a mistake in his life—just ask him, he’d love to tell you all about it. If there’s room for both you and his head in the same room, you’ll have a great time hearing all of his war stories.  So anyway, the guy has a complete and total mental block when it comes to foreign languages.  I learned this the hard way when I convinced him to take Latin with me Freshman year, and witness as he nearly found a way to fail the course. Twice.  I’ve copied the kid’s homework, gotten caught, and NOT been chastised by the Prof, because he said, and I quote, “If you had to resort to copying AWOL’s homework, you must’ve been really desperate.  Just don’t let it happen again.”  So for me, it wasn’t surprising to listen to him fail again and again and again. After EVERY time, the brothers would stop and say, AWOL, it’s pronounced “Oh- ma- cron.” And he would stand there, against the all, his mouth would twitch, his eyes would squint, and, without fail, he would sputter “Oh- MY- cron” like a baby trying to beg for its bottle.  Hilarity would ensue. We’d be blamed for not helping him with his problem, and Bows & Toes would occur, again.  After about an hour of this, it came down to this one, final exchange…  BROTHER:  AWOL, if you can say “Omicron” you all get to go home. AWOL:   Oh… Oh… Oh… MY-cron….  BROTHER:  BOWS & TOES!!!  ..I still don’t think he can say it correctly. Jackass.  Until next time, get back to work, -apk

      Just like in my entire college career, my enthusiasm for doing any kind of work has deteriorated to almost nothing.  At the beginning of a semester I would tell myself “This semester is going to be different!  I am going to go to every class, do all of my reading and get my work done on time!  I am getting all A’s!”  A few weeks later, that scholastic determination was turned into “20 Page paper worth 50% of my grade that I knew about since the beginning of the semester, due tomorrow at 9 am, its 2 am... DIDN’T EVEN START” C= DEGREE.  So then I think about this column and I take the laziness one step further...D= Diploma.  So my column, due Tuesday night and it's Noon on Wednesday: DIDN’T EVEN START.  I am in the process of moving and getting ready to start a new job so I’ve been pretty busy, but JUST LIKE THE MAIL GETS DELIVERED NO MATTER WHAT... SO DOES GOING POSTAL.   The Democratic Convention was last week, and every time I went to Knor’s blog spot, I would actually see the jizz emitting from the crotches of the left wing hippie liberals that infest this website.  Kujo was loving every minute of it, whacking off in the corner during Howard Dean’s speech.  Everything was going great.  The positive agenda of not personally attacking the president completely broke down turning it into a Bush bashing session.  Then the main event.  John Kerry’s make or break speech!  What a delivery!  What a clear, decisive message!  Oh wait..  *Kerry said John Edwards will make a great vice president and is ready to be president.  When in the primary campaign he ripped Edwards for not being qualified or not having enough experience to be President.  *Kerry said that when he’s president, families will not have to hold bake sales to pay for body armor for the troops.  When Kerry VOTED AGAINST THE 87 BILLION DOLLARS THAT GAVE BODY ARMOR TO OUR TROOPS.  *Kerry said that he will never mislead America in to war EVEN THOUGH THAT FUCKIN BOTOX DOUCHE VOTED FOR THE WAR.   I am going to join the democratic party and hold a waffle brunch for John Kerry and his campaign. Then at the exact moment he bites into one of my delicious waffles, I will call him a cannibal because he will be eating himself.          And I know at this very moment research essays are being written by enraged liberals who put down their burning American flags 5 minutes to write a SERIOUS RESPONSE.  I have a serious response to these left wing hippies: Kill Yourself.  That will be a good start to making America STRONGER AT HOME AND MORE RESPECTED IN THE WORLD.   I could go on and on enraging you liberals with absolute fact but I’d rather talk about something much more important than any election, issue, or political move: THE UPCOMING NFL SEASON.  Professional Football in America defines us as Americans.  While Europeans enjoy kicking a ball around for 90 straight minutes and letting their games end in ties, AMERICANS WANT BIG HITS, ELABORATE PAGEANTRY AND EXTREME AND EXCITING ACTION ending with a definite winner.  America lives for the NFL, it counts down the seconds until the season starts.  Sunday mornings are torture whether you’re watching pre-game shows or in church desperately waiting for your team's game to come on.  NFL football is the official religion of America. With that, here is  GOING POSTAL’s Official NFL Preview and Predictions .   Unlike ESPN, I will not get on my knees and use my sucking power to bolster the reps for the overrated likes of Steve “Better than Jesus” McNair, Ray “I ain’t seen nofin” Lewis, and the entire Dallas Cowgirls organization.  Here are my predictions for the season:   AFC East :    Patriots  :  13-3 (Boston will be too busy killing themselves over the latest Red Sox Playoff Loss to the Yankees that they wont even notice)   Bills  :   8-8 (There coach is named MALARKEY.. The end)     Dolphins  :  6-10 (If pot gets legalized between now and September, then Ricky will come back to lead them to the superbowl)   Jets  :  6-10 (Renting a stadium and fans from the Giants didn’t produce victories before and they won’t produce them now)   AFC South:     Colts:   12-4 (Peyton Manning will MAKE SURE that he doesn’t have two consecutive good games before the AFC title game)   Titans : infinity-0 (ITS SAINT MCNAIR TO THE RESCUE!! STEVE MCNAIR IS THE BEST DRUNK DRIVER OOPS I MEAN QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL Seriously, titans will go  8-8)   Jaguars  and  Texans  will suck as usual.    AFC North:    Bengals : 10-6 (someone has to win this crappy division, might as well give the bungals a chance)       Ravens:  9-7 (Murdering people is cool.  Helping your cousin buy cocaine is just as cool)   Steelers:  8-8 (Cowher might use the power of his chin to will the Stillers into the playoffs, but I gotta be safe and say 8-8)   Browns:  4-12 (This team is going to be absolutely horrible and Kellan Winslow will not even suit up this season)   AFC West:     Chiefs : 11-5 (they are guaranteed 8 wins because they just don’t lose at home.  And I want Dick Vermeil in the playoffs so I can see him cry after his defense once again costs him a trip to the superbowl.)   Broncos : 10-6 (its fuckin’ cold up there. The broncos can get to the superbowl on the momentum of a possible Kobe Bryant conviction in nearby Eagle, Co.)   Raiders : 7-9 (Warren Sapp is a fat fuck)   Chargers : 5-11 (but they will still finish better than Eli’s team!!)   NFC East :   Eagles : 14-2 (nooo, I’m not a homer.  The superbowl is a stone cold mortal lock.)   Redskins : 9-7 (Joe Gibbs will make them better but we will see the REAL Clinton Portis)   Cowgirls : 8-8 (Antonio Bryant and Bill Parcells will have a fight on national TV thus ruining their season)   Giants : 3-13 (Not only will this team be horrible and they will realize that Eli sucks, but they also will have to give up a high draft pick to the chargers.  Tiki will once again lead the league in fumbles)   NFC South:    Falcons : 11-5 (Michael Vick needs to win lots of games so he can make enough money to bail his brother out of prison)   Panthers : 10-6 (This team can just as easily go 7-9.  Those lucky close-game wins of last year will catch up to them)   Bucs : 7-9 (Eat shit Gruden)   Saints : 6-10 (Shawn Salisbury’s favorite team will once again prove that Shawn’s prediction abilities were as good as he was in the NFL)   NFC North:    Vikings:  10-6 (This division sucks ass, so the Viks should prevail)   Packers:   8-8 (Brett Favre has no more fathers in his life that can conveniently die in time to get him into the playoffs)   Lions:  5-11 (Come on, they are the lions)   Bears:  4-12 (DAAAAAAAAAAAA BUMS)   NFC West :   Seahawks : 12-4 (if the eagles are gonna lose a 4th strait NFC title game, this will be the team to beat them)   Rams : 10-6 (OVERRATED clap clap clap clap clap OVERRATED clap clap clap clap clap)   Cardinals : 7-9 (They will have more wins than fans at their games)   49ers : 1-15 (This will be the absolute worst team in football)    Superbowl:Eagles over anyone from the AFC.   AND IF THE EAGLES DON’T WIN THE SUPERBOWL, YOU WILL BE ATTENDING MY FUNERAL. I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.  Anyway, Half assed column this week.  Oh well... D certainly does equal diploma.  See you next week maybe.  -URAM

       Sorry to disappoint, but I've not yet heard from Uram today. Needless to say, this week's installment of "Going Postal" will be delayed until after his appointed rounds.      As for me, I'm in a shitty mood today.  Bodes well for the blog, I know.  I think I finally hit my post-birthday denouement, and it's very un-swell.  Doing work has been an impossibilty today, as I'm finding it hard to concentrate.  Have you ever had a secret  so big , that it just  HAD  to be let out. You wanted nothing more than to share it with the entire universe, but couldn't? That's how I feel today (although mine's just about the worst-kept secret ever) and it's driving me batty.      Anyhow, kiddies, just wanted to let you all know that your weekly dose of NEPA hilarity will be a little delayed. Kujo, post-up and let me know if you really want a Mr. Beer. We have one, and it's pretty solid.  I dunno if Target still sells them or not, but if they do, I'll hook you up.  Leave your mailing address, and I'll just have it sent to your house or something.      Plans for my Thursday column are slowly taking shape, stay tuned.  Also, if anyone's interested in a guest weekend gig, let me know.      In the meantime, say your prayers and eat your vitamins, and start pricing labotomies for me, I might need one soon.      melodramatically yours, i remain,   -apk

      This post is like the Diamond Cutter, you never... saw it... coming.  Okay, well, you probably  did , I do have a tendency to post a poll every Tuesday, don't I. Well today, my friends, you get TWO polls! No, no, please-- save your applause. Just send money.  Before we get to the polls, though, it's time to give out some Asylum.  The following friends are forgiven for forgetting my berfday because they stepped up yesterday:  Marc, Kujo, KGoff.  with special thanks to the KGBeast for pickin' up the tab at Bar Louie last night. More specifically, to Kev's employer for pickin' up the tab. Hooray Expense Account!   and now it's time for the MAIN EVENT:     POLL 1)  What should be the point of the Thursday column, and what should I title it?  POLL 2)  What should I get Kujo as a wedding present?  That's about all we got for today.  Things have slowed down significantly since the weekend, but there's still plenty to get done.  I almost can't wait for school to start, just so I can catch my breath. Sad, no?  Anywho, be good to each other, I'll be back sooner or later. -apk

      Okay, so here goes, YOUR Monday Hangover,  Birthweekend started out with a gangbusters baseball game in Upper St. Clair on Friday.  Although the Pubbers fell to the South Hills team, putting an end to our season, we fought valiantly, despite being undermanned, and fell in extra innings.  I played my first full game at first base since Little League, and performed satisfactorily.  Offensively, I found my way on base 3 out of 5 times, with 3 Walks, one which led to our first run.  For me, it was a pretty fun way to end a disappointing season.  At the very least, I made some cool new friends, and look forward to playing again next year.  Friday night, Drew, Kup, & I headed on d’ahn to the Southside to have some late dinner and throw a few brews back.  Fat Heads and Mario’s normally amounts to a pretty good time, and despite the significant lack of single hotties on scene, a good time was had by all.  Basically, any time you can have a Guys’ Night Out with your two best friends, life is good. FEM wasn’t ENTIRELY in effect, but the machine might just be warming up the engine.   Saturday was pure spectacularness.  A venerable Who’s Who of my closest friends attended an ol’fashioned BBQ at 707.  Special thanks to Kup for cooking the meat and ‘dina for bringing along heaping helps of both pasta salad and corn on the cob. If anyone wants to come over this week and eat leftovers (and there’s plenty) just give me a call!  Megan knocked one out of the park with mixed fruits and whatever that tasty-as-all-hell cream cheese dip was. Awesome.  However, the food MVP award firmly belongs to Jeanie.  She did well with both the Snickers Pie (or so I heard) and also the Milky Way Pie (even though a Milky Way isn’t really “a Snickers without the nuts” as I had convinced her).  But most importantly, the HIGHLIGHT of the evening was the Specially Made for the Birthday Boy (that’s me) Blackberry Pobbler (is it Pie? Is it Cobbler? Who cares! It’s DELICIOUS).  Yes, that’s right—she made me my favourite dessert.  And the two of us ate 99.783% of it ourselves. Needless to say, Jeanie rules.  My brother kicked ass with his gift for me: the brand-spankin’ new DVD of V:the Complete TV Series.  Although I’ve never seen any episodes of the actual series, this now completes my V set, and was one of the coolest, most unexpected gifts I received.  Speaking of gifts, let’s get to the list, with specific thanks for each.  I can honestly say I didn’t expect any single one of these, and they’re all great.  Not only did Kup go above and beyond Friday night, footing the bill for all of my misadventures in masculinity, he also gave me an éclair (which looks good) and an AMAZING BOOK known as “Mythologies: the DC Comics Art of Alex Ross.”  Alex Ross is a comic book artist world renown for painting ultra-realistic versions of heroes. The book is a complete collection of all his pictures of DC heroes like Batman, Superman, etc. It’s a cornucopia of stuff I can steal for the projects I’m currently working on. And it’s the ONE thing I didn’t get from my Christmas list. He really outdid himself, and I can’t say enough about this one.  Jeanie, along with the aforementioned ridiculously delicious edibles also gave me a spiffy Spider-Man magnet for the fridge, a CD of weird and unusual “music,” and a FANTASTIC book called “Tales to Astonish” that’s all about the life and times of Jack ‘The King’ Kirby.  Jack Kirby, for those of you not in the know (I’m looking at YOU, everybody!) is the father of all modern comic book art.  He created most of the Marvel Universe with Stan Lee back in the sixties, as well as Captain America, himself, in the ‘40s.  It’s basically this simple: without Jack Kirby, there’d be no Alex Ross. He’s the Henry Ford of the only truly American artform.  It’s an intriguing book I didn’t know even existed, and I can’t wait to read it.  Lara, despite her affinity for Ashlee Simpson, showed great taste in giftbuying with the purchase of a Spider-Man Pez Dispenser from the Pez museum somewhere in PA.  We all know that Pez rules, and we all know that Spidey rules, so basically.. ‘Nuff Said! Thanks Lara!  Another thoughtful gift was a picture frame  avec  picture of Ang and I from my aunt’s prom, sent to my with a lovely card by Ang.  Much appreciated and sentimental.   What else do we got? I really think I’m forgetting something, but I’m going to move on anyway(s).  All other friends just did a hell of a job showing up and partying, which means more to me than you can imagine.  The party was sufficiently Frat-tastic.  We finally dusted off the ol’ Beruit table and got to work on a well-priced ½ barrel of Champagne.  You can’t beat a party that features All You Can Drink Miller High Life, can you?  It was your standard fare: Kup gets a partner, Kup never loses, everybody gets drunk.  We played fratty music and ate man-food. I think good times were had by all.  Kup even did his obligatory stair-dive at the end of the night, and many a friend crashed and burned in the living room.  I was 0-2 on the table, but not because of my partner, who shot extremely well for a rookie. Basically, as usual, I sucked.  We DO have a TON of beer left over, though, so if anyone wants to come shoot a couple games this week, just give us a call.  Sunday, Kup and I headed on down to the Knor Hacienda in Herminie, watched a couple movies with my bro (“Marriage is punishment for shoplifting in some countries”) and had a fantastic dinner with my entire family.  Luckily, Danny didn’t throw any icecubes this time, and (though we reached DefCon 3 on two occasions) had no major meltdowns.  I’ve heard it must suck to get old, but with great friends, great family, and great times, I don’t see how.  Thanks again to all who made it a really really really special and fun weekend. And thanks to all of those who were there in spirit. Also, Banner sent me the Text, mystery solved. So thanks for the shoutout, bro.  Hopefully we’ll be sinking our canoe soon, I'd really like to fill the Lake with cement and build a hotel on top of it. We'd make mad coin. (if anyone but Jamie understood that, God Bless You)  Until next time, -apk

      Well, I once received some sagelike advice from Jeanie recommending that I "always leave them wanting more." And since she's already told me she's anxiously awaiting my post-birthweekend blogdate, I've decided to do just that.  There's an AWFUL lot to recap on what was one of my best birthdays ever (although 2001 will probably NEVER be touched), and I've got an AWFUL lot of work to get through today, so that update will be here sooner or later.. who knows? keep checking back to find out!  In the meantime, here's my LONGEST LIST OF SHOUT-OUT THANK YOUS EVER, which specifically goes to anyone out there who wished me a happy birthday. If you're not on this list, I, like the Saudis, will offer asylum to anyone who steps forward over the next 24 hours and wishes me a happy birthday. Otherwise, you run the risk of perpetual torment and public lambasting here in my little corner of cyberspace.  So, without further ado, thanks to the following friends/family for being amazing:  Mom, Dad, Adina, Danny, Chris, Penny, Kup, Drew, Doug, Kris, Bill, Jeanie, Nic, Uram, Megan Starr, Megan P., Shannon, Ron, Nicole, Brietta, Lara, Danielle, Gavin, Bling, Whitney, Erin, Jon, Jackie, Claire (whose birthday's ALSO 8/1/80), Will (Happy Birthday tomorrow!), Jerry, Natalie, Tanaka (congratulations on the engagement!), AliMac, Kristy, Aunt Cindy, Aunt Paulette, Grandma, Candace, Ang, and Whoever texted me (Nate?). You are all awesome. I love you all.  that's pretty exhaustive... although i feel like i've forgotten someone.. my apologies in advance.  stories to come later -apk

      What the HELL DOES THAT MEAN? You ask? Okay, well, in the 80s there was a baseball movie (and I use that term loosely, it was more like a chick flick with baseball in it) called  The Sluggers Wife .  In  The Sluggers Wife , Michael O'Keefe, who you all know, I believe as "Danny" from  Caddyshack  (i could be wrong there...) is a ballplayer for the Braves who sucks.  Until he meets super-hot Rebecca DeMornay, who plays the part of some dive-band lead singer chick.  Long story short, when she's not at the games, he blows. When she's there, or he calls her on the bullpen phone before At Bats, he makes a run at Maris's HR record.  Cheesey 80s garbage, yes. But also harmless baseball fun.  I distinctly remember this being one of my sister's favourite movies as a kid. (That should be telling in an of itself, her favourite movies include  Patch Adams, Airborne, and Grease , with only ONE of those being a legitimately decent movie.) But I digress.  Anywho, last night Kup convinced me to go to the Pirates game, which, sure enough, led to them having another incredibly memorable win.  Between Kup and I, we've been present for EVERY BIG GAME they've had this year, and that's not even a lie. I'm not going to jinx it and outline it all, but maybe I'll explain more in depth at the end of the season.  Moving right along, last night Rob Mackowiak had yet ANOTHER Game-Winning RBI with me in attendance. I've seen the Pirates win eight games this year, and he's had the GWRBI in FOUR of them. Ridiculousness.   I actually ran through all his stats for all 12 games I've been to, and when extrapolated to a 162 game season, Rob Mackowiak would hit  40 HOME RUNS  with  162 RBI!  That's is insane! INSANE! I'm going to dilligently wait next to my phone today for Rob to call and ask me to come to every game for the rest of his career. If he knows what's good for him, he will.  Anyway, that's about it from me for this Wednesday-- It's Uram's day, although I don't know if he'll be sending anything along, as he's currently training for his new job, and is stranded in Grove City, PA.  (Normally, I'd insert an anti-GC joke in here, to make fun of Jeanie and AliMac, but it's Jeanie's birthweek, so she gets a repreive.)  Speaking of which! Happy Birthday, early, Jeanette! Tonight will, hopefully, be crazy-go-nuts. I know I'll do my part.  Alrighty, kids, kick back and wait for Uram (or Kup, possibly Pinch-Hitting) and in the meantime, send more opinions on quality fast food/drunk food.  Later, -apk

      Hidey-ho junior rangers!  Because I’ve been so long-winded around here of late, we’re gonna keep it short today, and stick to the tried-and-true Tuesday format: short ramblings from the Nibbler, followed by YOUR very special poll.  First up, the call has gone up, and the bat-signal has been answered.  KUP will be supplying a GUEST COLUMN this weekend, further detailing he and Banner’s exploits in Jerseydom.  Should be some fantastic reading, so be sure to check back this Friday evening for the sordid details.  Last night, after enjoying an always pleasantly tasty Kup & Megan dinner, we kicked back and ON DEMANDED (which, by the way, is a GREAT feature brought to you proudly by Comcast) “Welcome to Mooseport.”  I think we were all in the mood for a dinky little comedy, and let me tell you, this one more than stepped up to the plate.  Ray Romano was incredibly likeable, and Gene Hackman’s Presidential character was a hoot. I thought he was going to be a dick from the looks of the previews, but in actuality, this was a tale with no true “bad guy.” It was just sweet, cute fun, with some solid laughs throughout. Special thumbs up to Fred Savage in a funny role.  I’ll be honest, this isn’t one of the greatest comedies of all time, but it’s the kind of movie you’d watch every time it’s on HBO, just because you know what you’re gonna get, and you’ll be entertained. It’s hard to find a movie that Kup, Megan, and I all like, but this was one. If you haven’t seen it, and are looking for a fun little comedy- this is your guy.  Alrighty, poll time! I mentioned yesterday my desire to rank to all-time greatest fast foods, so here’s where YOU come in!    What’s your favourtie fast food item or items of all time, and why?    Is it SHEETZ FRYZ? A Big Mac?  Wendy’s Chicken Cordon Bleu ( a lost champion)? I’m not asking for your favourite meal, either.. I’m thinking more along the lines of  1) your drunk; OR 2)   hungover  and you need a food that’s not just going to “hit the spot,” but drive a truck THROUGH the spot, filling you up with tasty-go-nutsness.  Let’s hear you, America! Peace out. -apk

       Because I’m tired of writing, and because his Saturday night was MUCH more interesting than beers on the Bored-walk, I’ve opened things up for Banner to tell us all about Saturday, from Wedding on.  When you’re reading it and thinking, “Hell, this is rambling and devoid of punctuation,” just remember that Banner has muscles, and he’ll kick your ass. Thus, I didn’t’ edit. Much thanks Oar-man!   Knor,to the best of my knowledge this is how my sat went...standard fare for the reception. got the obligitory pics taken beforehand then made our way to Breakers...game on! we all killed crab cakes, bruschetta, and whatever else was on those trays. as we were holding our ground just outside where they were bringing them out not too many trays made it by for some time. the bar was open and we were doing our best to kill whatever alcohol they had behind there. the groomsmen retired to the basement and awaited our introductions. after some pomp and pagentry and a well-spoken prayer from one of the "hired guns" we all sat at attention and intently listened to what we had all come to see....no, not the first dance, nate's speech. oh and did he ever deliver! if you weren't there, words would be a gret injustice to that extemporaneous masterpiece. at one point I think that he refered to me as james ernest...and we'll leave it at that. a few sentimental tear-filled dances with moms and dads later we were all off and running. although you told me about this later, the nate conversation with the bartender regarding what he wanted with his whiskey was perhaps one of the greatest alcoholic quotes ever. "A glass" tremendous. the food was great, but the waitreses were better. unfortunately (and yes we did ask and made a damn good case for them) we were not allowed to dance with them. standard fare of eating, cake-cutting, and much imbibing followed. Afterwards we were hurriedly ushered out, took some more pics (look for them in Dickinson magazine sometime soon), and some of us went for a swim...tux pants and all. I and I think everyone else were all well off by this point and headed back to the hotel for more debauchery. buff and smith, I think, were out to get beers so we hijacked some from the hotel somehow and caused a ruckus poolside for the better part of an hour. a few noise complaints and a pissed of employee later we headed back to the rooms, filled the tub with ice and beer and got ready for the rest of the evening. I forget what the name of the bar was that we were supposed to be going to, but I know that kup, jeff and I never made it. I left a little early because we wanted to stop and get something to eat and I was in desperate need of gas. as kup wanded me in (thanks to Captain Bill for that!) jeff dropped to idea of going to an OAR concert just up to road on us. about 0.2 seconds later we were getting beer next door and rolling up the GSP to the show. free VIP parking later (thanks to Jeff for moving those barriers aside) we had yards of beer and tickets in hand. we managed to get to the front of the lawn area as they came on. perfect timing! great show! they walked off to Sunday Bloody Sunday right after Crazy Game of Poker...yeah, yeah you got that right. a few purposely spilled yards of urine later (6 feet of pee is quite impressive if you've never seen it) we ventured back to the parking lot to finish the beers in the cooler and tried to snag some poor unsuspecting ladies...mission accomplished on both counts thanks to Face! we finished all of our beers, went to their car, finished their beers, talked to some staties and proceeded to do about 500 power slides in my car in the empty parking lot. I now need 2 new rear tires, but it sounded like a great idea at the time. beers gone it was time for the bar. we immediately feared for our lives as we realized that the 400+lb guy across the bar was the brother of the "Jersey girl" that we, ok I came in with. I though we were going to die if we made any sudden movements. luckily there was only time for on beer before last call. when in Rome, do as the Romans do, so we were off to Guido's Jughandle Diner down the road. a lot of greasy food later it was 3:30AM and it was time to go home. we said our goodbyes to "jersey girl", "booby mcgee", and "john john" and staggered back to the hotel. we got lost, got straightened out by a well-timed call from jersey girl and headed home. finding everyone on the hotel room sleeping, much to our dismay, me raised hell. there was name calling, nate was accosted by kup with a pillow, and you and broms just tried to ignore us. nature, always up for a brewtus, minced his was to the tub and threw a few brain bombs at us. drinking at 4 am when you're already wasted is a great idea. finally we all succumbed to the effects of a very long weekend and passed the hell out.....Saturday was finally over, but we have the pics to prove everything! cheers to jeff's camera phone. it was, by far, the most jersey night that I have ever had. it was spectacular thanks to kup, jeff, OAR, some jersey girls, and most importantly, BEER! at least that's what I remember of it anyway.if you need to fill in any gaps, ask kup, but i'm not sure that he remembers anymore that I do.bahahahahaha-BB   And there you have it, ladies and gents-- my weekend, in three bite-sized morsels! enjoy! and start posting! (btw: it's AMAZING that GrampyStaub actually registered as "GrampyStaub")      see yinz tommorrah, n'at!   -apk

       Previously, in the Kingdom…  The car ride to Jersey is LONG! Frat guys invade Applebees! Buff sure is drinking a lot!  And now, Part II of:  THE GREAT JERSEY ADVENTURE!   So we’re all hanging out at Applebees, drinking BREWTUSES and eating various appetizers while everyone catches up on each others’ lives.  A veritable all-star team of Theta Chis, significant others, and newfound friends (like the A-Train) are on hand: Me, Kup, Kujo, Mr. & Mrs. Buff, Jewbacca, the Frog and his lovely girlfriend, Bruce Banner, the Dominator, the Nature Boy and the KGBeast.  If I’ve forgotten anyone, I apologize. I simply neglected you because this evening firmly belonged to Buff.  Within an hour, the man-beast got so drunk that he:      -Bit through a pen (“there’s a lot of plastic in my mouth!”)      -purposely urinated on Kup’s foot      -proclaimed, while sitting barside, “it’s midnight! There are no kids around! If I want to say f#ck, I can say f#ck! F#ck. F#ck. F#ck f#ck!”  he was in rare form. I’d tell you more, but when he started punching me, I decided to turn in for the evening. Needless to say, I was exhausted by then anyhow.  As Kujo had become particularly plastered at that point, he turned in with Broms, Dom and I, and the other few good soldiers stayed behind for the last half hour to close the place.  Special thanks to the roommate for bringing me back some crayons, as my affinity for drawing on restaurant placemats is well documented.   The next morning, it was WEDDING TIME, BABY! We awoke for the early-morning (11:30am) nuptials, and headed out to the church, but not before I proved, yet again, that I am clairvoyant as all hell.  The Scene:  Kup and Knor, in their hotel room preparing for the wedding.  Kup is ready to go and watching TV, Knor is shaving in the bathroom.  The rest of the brothers staying in the room are in the wedding party, and have already left their bags in the hotel room and headed to the church.  The phone rings.  On the phone, the Best Man, the Nature Boy: “Kup, can you find and bring my camera, I forgot it, it’s in my bag”  Kup: “sure. Found it.”  Knor: “who’s that, Nate? He forgot the rings, didn’t he!?!?”  Kup: “nope. Just his camera.”  ::fade to black::  About 45 minutes or so later, we arrived at the church at 11, just as the place began to fill up.  As we arrive, we’re confronted with this news from the other groomsmen, “Bromberg and Dom just left, they have to drive (25 min) back to the hotel to find the rings. NATE LEFT THEM IN THE ROOM…. Don’t tell anyone”  Needless to say, the wedding was a bit delayed. (although we got a HELL of a great laugh out of the situation when the priestess actually ANNOUNCED the reason for the delay to the congregation!)  That, compounded with the debut of Nate’s “BLUE STEEL” look during the entirety of the ceremony made it a very memorable wedding.  And for what it’s worth, it was a beautiful little ceremony with a lot of heart. Congratulations and God Bless to Kujo and Darielle.   Part III: “MMMMmmmmmmm appetizers.” Coming soon  Also stay tuned for: SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL—the Bruce Banner Story  -apk

      Well, it’s Monday morning, I’m exhausted, my back is cramped like it’s nobody’s business, and my wallet has a hole in it the size of Manchuria, which can only mean one thing:  The weekend was frickin’ fratastic.  Leaving work early on Friday, things got off to a slowwwww start as I had to stop by the PennDOT Licensing Center before hitting the road. My license had expired, so it was time to sit in line for an hour in order to earn the right to spend 2 minutes having my picture taken before picking up my new card. I'm certain in was in the 4th Level of Hell, I just can't prove it. Hooray bureaucracy!   (Digression one: I love the new Red Stripe (it's beer! hooray beer!) marketing campaign. Not only is it INCREDIBLE that they're actually hocking Red Stripe on TV, but they even make fun of the facts that: 1) the bottle is weird. 2) it's Jamaican beer, and tastes like that sounds 3) beer is fun! The commercials are simple, cute, and funny. I approve. THAT is what a commercial should be like. Everyone, please support this ad campaign by making "Hooray (insert noun here) !" your new catch-all exclamation. It's great as both a truly excited utterance, "Hooray Paycheck!" and also as a sarcastic remark (which I have preferred) "Hooray Syphilis!" Too much fun. Digression Over.)   Anyhoo, after the obligatory pit stop at SHEETZ for the ol’ Turkey/Bacon/Swiss Pretzel Roll and one of their NEW! Cream-Cheese Stuffed Pretzels (***1/2 out of four. Not quite McGriddle Level, but highly recommended nonetheless... somebody remind me to rank fast food this week), I spent the next SIX HOURS on the road. Not only is that the longest I’ve ever driven, but it was the most Boring. Drive. Ever.  I’ll sum up with a nice little diagram, try to use your imagination.  START                                                                                                          END PGH - - - - - - Somerset (20 min. nap)- - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -NJ  If you’ll notice, I can do that diagram on one single X-Axis because it’s a STRAIGHT WESTERNLY SHOT across the damn state on the PA Turnpike (“The Best Damn Two-Lane Highway Full of Potholes and Construction, With No Scenery, PERIOD.”) To sum up: It was straight. It was far. It was fun listening to all of my CDs and rocking out to Huey.  So I arrive in the Garden State just in time to rendez-vous with the roommate and BUFF and Mrs. Buff at Applebees. We partook in some Brewtuses (  NEW CATCHPHRASE ALERT!  “beer” has gone from “brain grenade” to “BREWTUS” –thanks to Nate, as usual)  and ate dinner before I checked into the Hotel. It was then I learned that Matty Smith was screwing Kup and I over on the room bill, but that’s another rant for another time.  Shortly thereafter, the Wedding Party returned from the rehearsal, and we proceeded to head BACK to Applebees to get fratty. Perhaps the quote of the night goes to Big Brother Nate, who informed us, “Guys, we’re those guys who are so old, they go to Applebees to drink now.” After looking around the room, and noticing that we were the youngest people there not waiting to be picked up by mom, we all got depressed. Laughed. Drank more. The Frat way.  This is already getting LONG, so I’m going to take a break now, listen to some ESPN radio( FINALLY… GUY JUNKER HAS COME BACK… to PITTSBURGH!), and then I’ll be back later to recap the rest of the weekend, in serial form. Consider this a cliffhanger!  CLIFFHANGER: You're at Applebees in Jersey and Buff eats a pen.. Pees on your foot...Starts dropping F-Bombs at the bar. What do you do?  What do you do?   and also-- if you have a wedding, and no one brings the rings, do you have a wedding?  In the meantime, give a hoot, don’t pollute! -apk
