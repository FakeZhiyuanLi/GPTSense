      yeah i know it's been a few days since ive writte. I'd love to say ive been really buisy, but in fact i just could never get on a computer at home. (darn computer hoggers in my family) well anyways. let's see what went on this week... hmmm well ok,           I started pilates about 2 weeks ago. it's not too hard. and it does make you feel a lot better once you're done. i would actually reccommend it to anyone that is looking for fast excersise (i think that's spelled wring but oh well) program. what else? hmm well i got 3 new CD's too. that was pretty cool. (Goldfinger-open your eyes, Jet-get born and reel big fish- turn the radio off - i think that's what it's called) All three are pretty good albums, but my fave is goldfinger, they're a mix or ska, rock, punk and a hint of pop, but watch out for the parental warning.          Good thing. about school- I raised my math grade from a D- to a D+. yeah still not great but it turns out my teacher gave me a 0 or a 100 pt test intead of an 82. so it raised my grade 14% that was really cool. yeah still need to raise it more and only have a FEW MORE WEEKS LEFT OF SCHOOL. yeah char don't say anything i know youre done next week. -Andrea-hey you

Well tomorrow's monday and a kinda start to an all new week. except for today of course. gotta remind myself not to eat any sweets. ive been trying that for a while, but those darn brownies just keep poppin up at ya from no where! gosh! ok well time to go sit in my bed and wait for tomorrow to come.

      Hey everyone if you can't tell from the title this is my first blog. and to prove my inexperience to you. i just typed about 2 paragraphs and deleted then just now somehow. yeah im stupid i know. gah that still makes me really mad. now i just have to type it over again. ok here goes. um.........  okokigotit....  hello.. my name is andrea and i love music (rock, punk rock, punk, classic rock, ska, heavy metal hard rock and much much more including country -yes country-, but i don't like rap or hip hop any other crap like that) I play the drums. im ok at it but as of now ive only been playing... about 5 months with no lessons or anything. My real hair color (yes it's mixed in there somewhere) is dirty blonde. but so far ive put red streaks,-Fire engine red and black streaks, maroonish streaks, and dark red steaks- in it. (at diffenet times of course) the red has faded every time. (i know why don't worry) so as of now my hair is dirty blonde with blach streaks and the bottom layer is black too. and mixed in there is some strawberry blonde from the faded red. so yeah it's pretty funky. i have green eyes. yeah i guess that's all im gonna say to descibe myslef.  on to other news (if you can call it news)  yesterday my sister had some friends over for a little b-day thing. one of them brought scary movie 3. yes the movie is pretty funny, but most of it has to do with the movie, The Ring... yeah i didn't like that movie too much.in other words.. it scared the crap outta me. yeah so now im home alone and im picturing that darn girl that comes outta the screen everywhere in my house. it's not fun lemme tell ya.  as for today. (other than picturing a killer girl thingie) I've been watching CMT pretty much the whole day. yep isn't my life just so lively? hehe well ok i guess that's it. I promise my blogs won't be so long next time. even if you want them to be long cu i just don't know what to say most of the time. -andrea "Hey You" (as called by my english teacher) H

      ok dont aske me about the name of the post today. i dunno why i put it. i just wanted to write something that would sound cool. ok it doesn't exactly sound awesome or anything, but well it's all i could come up with at the moment. sigh. summer sucks and it's only been 3 days. yeah. shucks shucks shucks. hmm well i think im gonna change this to a xanga account. ill  probably keep this one too, but the xanga thing is just more active, i think. plus it's easier to get skin and stuff. if im gonna get kicked off or something for saying this, then someone tell me. okiday? oh well, my friend just called me to tell me to come back from away on IM. hehe that was kinda funny. since i was still at the computer, but when no one's on i just leave for a while and put an away message. yeah so she was like "won't you get on already?" and i started to laugh and said ok so yeah. and then she ended up having to get off in like 5 minutes anyway. so yeah it was all kinda funny.  hmm water polo tournament tomorrow. wish us luck. -drea

      aw crap, now ive got all the hard stuff. booooooo!!! oh well yes today was my last day of school. i had my world cultures final today. a final that im pretty sure made my grade drop from a B to a C. yeah ain't that great?? oh well. it's over anyways. today i got my ACDC CD's !!!! yayayayaya. it's a pack. it has the CD back in black and then a whole bunch of unrealeased songs and live stuff. yeah it's cool i LOVELOVELOVE ACDC. and ive been wanting at least one of their CDs for forever. and now i finally have 5 hehe. yeah they're awesome. post if ya like them too. even though i don't really think too many people read this (not a problem for me cuz then i don't have to worry about too many people knowing what's going on in my mind) hehee. but yeah im happy that i got the CD's today i got out of school at like 940 but left at about 10. And i sorta did a mini makeover one my room. i took down some stuff cleared off my desk, put up a mear and decorated my desk a little with a candle. it looks Trés cool if ya ask me (ive always wanted to say Trés cool and i think i used that right, right?) yeah but it looks cool and the candle makes my room smell really good. now i just have stuff piled on my bed. yeah so ive gotta find a place for all of that. and i still have to do more stuff in my room cuz i still don't like everything about it. here ill describe it a bit so you can get the vibe. first off the basics. it has 4 walls and a ceiling. the walls are like a light forest/ mint green (leftover from my obsession with green when i was like 10)(i still like it but want a change) ok the ceiling is white but i have glow-in-the-dark stars all over it (constellation leo too!) hmm what else my bed is at a diagonal angle from the corner farthest from the door. it has black cover w/leopard print on the other side and leopard print pillows (leftover from my jungle obsession (i still like that too though)) umm oh yeah i have a maroon canopy/mosquito net thing (you know those things right?) i have a black and white clash poster, a green Me First and the GG's poster, a red MXPX poster and a black and white/yellow NOFX poster placed strategically on one of the walls. umm my closet is white with a bunch of pictures and paintings stuff on it. (ha im boring you aren't i?? well sorry but i have to finish describing it now that i've started.) ok i have a big window on the other side, a oval mirror next to it with my desk underneath (a tan desk with a white sheet on top of it with a black stripe in the back and a glass vase with a candle in it right below the mirror.) on the last wall i have a calendar, my lttl white board thing, and a hanging thing with all my CD cases and books in it. oh yeah and then on the back of my door i have a bunch of pics too. oh yeah and finally, strung diagonally across the top of my room i have pictures that ive taken hanging up on a string like in a dark room. yeah that's pretty much it. try and picture it. maybe ill post a pic of it when it's clean. and then you can see if your mental picture was right. happy mental picturing!!! -drea ps hope everyone had a good school year!!!

(WHOO)and um the yeah yeah yeah, (But they really suck im sorry what's her name CANNOT sing) don't think i saw anyone else. we left after the beastie boy because all that was left was umm what's their names.... uhhh The Strokes. idon't really like them. so it was all right. the only relaly bad thing is that my feet were hurting and people smoke soooo much there that everywhere you turn there's smoke. oh yeah and it got really hot and then really cold later hehe. but it was great other than that. even though i wanted to see story of the year. oh well. i still wanna go to warped tour more, but have no one to go with! poo. oh well. type again later -drea oh yeah i invited the guy to my b-day. yeah, it was nothing big. doubt he'll even go but whatever.

      yeah im pissed off. and my coach was pissed off today too. so yeah the title of this post fits it perfectly. to start off, im pissed off becasue today we got our projects for World cultures back, and i got a friggin D!!!! man i was in shock. i thought i had actually done an OK job. i mean i wasn't expecting an A or anything but come on at least a C- or something. BUT NO!!! my god. and i got a good grade on my presentation too. so he really marked me down on the actual magazine. it's just not right. cuz my magazine looked pretty good if i do say so myslef.  grrr and the second point. my water polo coach came to practice mad. and yelled at us during the scrimage. i didn't even do something bad and he completely barked at me. (not literally of course) and then the other coach told me not to worry cuz it wasn't my fault. which it wasn't. so my first coach was just yelling at everyone today. and lemme tell you, when your coach is like 6 feet already, and then you're down floating in the water. IT's Freaking scary lemme tell you. Sigh yeah so i WAS having a good day. and then 5th period rolled around... and then it just went down to loo. poopoopoo. grrrrr hm ok well i think that's pretty much it.

      hehe.  something sorta random happened to me today. well ok it probably wasn't random to them, but these 2 guy s in my class asked me if i wanted to be their translator. *sigh* here's the story. they wanna go to chile and go snowboarding. but i guess they can't speak spanish very well. and well, im in spanish AP, and im a freshman. (get the pic?) well anyways yeah they pretty much asked me if i would want to go snowboarding in chile with them just to be their translator. Now normaly i would think 2 guys like that would be joking, but one of them that i know od it a really hardcore boarder. so yeah it was still weird. Then after that i couldn't stop thinking about how awesome that would be to go boarding in chile. VERYVERY VERY awesome. but year right like i could actually go. yeah i can't stop thinking aobut that and just thought i would let anyone whos reading this know that little story. sigh, you know i was j ust thinking... to some people it would think it was weird that people like me are "pouring out our personal life on something like this" well lemme just ell ya. it's not really a personal life. well not for me anyway. see everything that im telling you is something that people would already know if they knew me or walked around my school with me. it's not even really my personal thoughts since whenever im thinking about something i have to tell SOMEONE. usually my sister gets that short end of the stick, but yeah. I guess some of this IS personal, but that's exactly why i don't give names. especially the one of the guy i like. but if you pay close enough attention and you know me, you can probably figure out who i like, just cuz i talk about him sometimes. and now i don't even remember why im on this subject, but yeah im just typing antything now in the hopes that someone will come across this and be amused. my sister is watching the pirates of the Carribean right now and it's at the part where jack sparrow is saving elizabeth Swan cuz she fell in the water cuz he corsette was too tight. hehe. it's a good movie to all you that haven't seen it yet. you should rent it if you haven't. cuz well. it's good. ok well i think that's all that really happened today. ill post tomorrow or something.  oh yeah i turned in my comic book today!! ITS DONE!!!!!! -drea PS *Mental note, copy Pantera CD for sam*

      hey everyone it's a monday and Im tired. Only  7 more days left of school and it's gonna be just a tiny bit stressfull, but only today. I have a comic book due tomorrow, and that's it. so finals are the only thing im gonna have to really worry about for the rest of this school year. YAY. well that and.. something else. oh yeah and my friends party and my b-day party, which i decided to have. I'm just not gonna invite the guy I like. it would be too stressfull. I'll invite him if he asks about it, but I'd probably do that for anyone if I liked them. yeah i know im a huge wimp, but im just not someone to really put my heart out on the line. It's not like my life's horrible without a guy. yeah well anyways yeah im having my party and im not going to water polo today. that's pretty much all that's really happening. wow there's this thing on the discovery channel right now. and it's talking aobut how a dead snake can still bite you cuz it's brains nerve cells can still work. yeah crazy huh? i don't get why some people think that if you watch the discovery channel your weird. They have some really cool shows on it. like american chopper, Mythbusters and more. you should check it out someday. ok well that's it for now buh bye -drea

      im listening to thtis band called Far From Known. They're not local for my city, but if i remember correctly they are from Lake Tahoe. They're still not known (hence the name I guess (I wonder if they'd change it if they got big (hmmm))) But they're still pretty good.  Oh yeah the polls more for people that know me at the moment, but if you want you can still answer it. you can pretend you know me :) Finally... We had our first water polo tournament today. we played man down for half a game since we on ly hace 6 people there from our team. (whoever flaked im gonna find and umm well i dunno but im gonna.. oh *sigh* GRRR.) but yeah im mad at whoever didn't show up. we lot all 3 of the games wich is kinda no suprise since most us our team has only had like 4 practices and we're all out of shape. oh well still have the rest of the summer. -drea

      hehe. yeah i know the title of this blog is just about one of the most used lines anywhere, but well that IS the question.  here's the story. im turning 15 this saturday the 12th. and i was thinking about having a big(ish) party. i mean i know i would already invite my good friends from RG, but what im thinking about is inviting my friends from school that i don't know as well. so yeah that's part of the dilemma. another part is what to do? i was thinking either bowling or going to play pool, but yeah im still deciding and looking at prices (kinda a lot of money either was so i dunno) a third thing that i must decide about is inviting this guy that I like. No i am NOT gonna say his name because well. he doesn't know i like him. or at least i don't think he does. :\. anyways yeah i dunno if i should invite him since well i kinda know him but i wouldn't want him to think "why the heck is she inviting me to a party?" so yeah that is another dilemma. arg god why do i have to think like this. anyone else and it woulda been like "party at my house, better be there" and they wouldn't think twice. well yeah that's me for ya. sigh. i saw harry potter yesterday. i went with my good friend charlotte. we got perfect seats. seriously. it was middle row center. the movie was great. the on ly thing that sucked is that it was really unconfertable sitting in those seats for like 2 1/2 hours. and the fact that there were these i dunno 5 girls that were harry fanatics. they started chanting harry harry harry when it started. and the first time that he came on the screen they all screamed like he was there. and then any time he did something good or when hermione punched Draco they all clapped. i was just like "they can't HEAR  you you idiots!!" yeah that was annoying, but other than that it was  a great great movie. Wish there was more quidditch tho. oh well. next movie right? -drea

      hmm is that how you spell it?? oh well. hmm what to say..... ok ill start with this, i haven't posted in a while (sorta) and that's mostly because i got a xanga account. ( www.xanga.com/vociferous24) but that does not mean ive forgotten about my little blog over here. well now that that's out of the way, my life lately has been boring and hectic at the same time. now how is that possible you might ask?? well ill tell ya. Mostly ive just been sitting around doing nothing, and then going to water polo practice. same old same old, but at the same time, i was planning on getting warped tickets, and then they stopped selling them, so i was bummed, then they started selling them again, so i was happy, and all this stuff surrounding the warped tour has been going on. yep so that's the hectic part. hmm what else? oh i saw the notebook! (the movie, yeah right like id be exited about seeing a notebook during the summer. arg school) anyways it really REALLY and i MEAN really good. but sad too. it's very romantic and pretty funny in some parts. almost every girl in the theater was crying. i amlost cried, but i never cry in movies so i kept my composure. (is that how you spell that??) oh well. yes but if you like romances it's a must see. and if your a guy that's seen it and your saying it wa sstupid, you know that SOMEWHERE in your mind your thinking. why cant i love someone like that or be loved like that. yeah you know you are. hmm what else? well i went to tahoe and took pics and stuff. fun fun. yeah i think that's pretty much all that's really happened lately. please forgive me if ive written something 2 times. i don't remember what my past posts are. i think ill go back and read how, ummmmmm "guy" obsessed i was. or more like how obsessed with one guy i was. oh and just for the record i wasn't really OBESESSED. it was just something that i was thinking about and decided (reather stupidly) to talk about it on this. oh well i wanted people to know what really went on in my head. oh im rambling buh bye -drea
