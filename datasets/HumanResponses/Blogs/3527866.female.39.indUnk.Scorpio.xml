						   First of two parts.  I am a nervous wreck.  We meet at 2pm at the 100 Center to get this all straightened out.  Our real estate agent does not sound happy.  If this doesn't work, I hope he can find us something else, fast.  I want this to work.  I have dreamed of having something in this building for years.  I have prayed and prayed this is what we're suppose to do.  I know it is, but where?  God isn't just going to hand us something.  I know we have to work for it.  But, oh boy, is this cutting it close.  I'll finish this up when I get back from the meeting.

						   Music Sunday.  I sang my heart out!  Sounded pretty good, too.  Monday is the day.  Supposedly, we're meeting with the owners of the 100 Center.  I am a little nervous.  We haven't heard from Bill Hunt yet about what time we are to meet.  We started this show back in early April.  I don't think I have ever heard of anyone having this much problem getting a lease signed.  I swear, if they turn us down, I'm hitting them with discrimination.  I hope Bill is right and they put the building up for sale.  On another subject completely, I have got to get this weight off.  I weighed in at 272 this morning.  I have never weighed that much!  I'm trying some new tactics, just see if they work.  Off to get the kiddle ready for bed.  Oh, yeah, President Reagan died yesterday.  He did a lot of good.  Not great stuff for the GLBT community or for AIDS, but good stuff world wide.  Better news tomorrow, I hope. Good night.

						   Well, at least some good news came today.  The real estate agent in charge of getting us our shop is thinking positive that we will get it Monday.  I told him to keep his eye out anyway for another spot.  I don't understand where our work ethic has gone!  I work my ass off.  I expect others to do their jobs.  They sure don't!  Seems like the nurses here expect everyone else to do their jobs.  What happened to hard working Americans?  When did we get soft and start sloghing off at our work?  I can't wait to get our bookstore open.  It will be such a pleasure to for us to work for ourselves and not have to look at a bunch of slackers.  Enough venting.  I was going to make an entry last night, but fell asleep.  Every once in awhile, it occurs to me how much I love Patty.  I look at her and am just overwhelmed.  I don't ever remember feeling like this before. It's the same with my daughter, our daughter.  I never wanted kids.  She was kind of an oops.  But, oh, what a joy.  She can frustate the hell out of me one minute and melt me the next.  We have so much fun together.    We are going to check out a couple of guys who have a Gay gift and jewelry website.  They seem excited at the chance to have a display at the coffee bar.  Got a babysitter so this will be first chance Patty and I have had to go out for a long time!  I feel like I have so much to do, I should turn in my resignation for 2 weeks and just let it go.  Need the money, though.  If there were just a few more hours in a day!  That's it for now.  More later, I'm sure.

						   Wow, I'm blogging!  I'm doing this to try to relieve some stress.  You see, Patty (my wife) and I are attempting to open the first GLBT bookstore in South Bend/Mishawaka, Indiana.  A set back yesterday with landlord and I'm a wreck.  We'll meet on Monday and try to sell them on the store.  Then, hopefully, get the keys.  Yes, I'm a dyke.  A very politically active one, too.  I'm hosting the Mishawaka HRC Meetup.  If you want, check it out at www.HRC.org and click on Meetup.  If you live around here, sign up!!  Stress on the job...Can't wait to quit!  Hopefully I'm still on track to leave here June 25th.  Find out Monday.  Ok, that's it for now, more later.  :)
