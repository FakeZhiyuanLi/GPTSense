       Yassir Arafat is a joke. A once proud freedom fighter (or ruthless terrorist) has turned into this corrupt figurehead barely holding on to the last vestiges of power and what little prestige that came with it. He's essentially been isolated and marginalized not only by his own vacillations and ineptitude but by the other major players in this sorry saga, Israel and the United States.  So what does Sharon do after "offing" a couple of Hamas leaders? He comes straight out and says that his  urlLink pledge  to leave Arafat alone is no longer binding. He's unilaterally "opting out" of the commitment he made to Bush to not harm Arafat. This effectively puts Arafat back in the spotlight and spurs the Palestinian street to re-embrace the corrupt, politically impotent, ineffective, aging lion to the degree that if (or when) he is ultimately killed, Sharon will have made him a martyr for the Palestinian cause who will be more popular and influential in death than he ever was in life.  What could Israel possibly have to gain by killing Arafat? He's already been effectively neutralized and his popularity, until this ridiculous development, was at an all-time low. At this point in his career and his life, Arafat has to be viewed as a complete failure as a leader of the Palestinian people and he knows it. The entire Palestinian agenda, be it the extreme goal of eliminating Israel or the more reasonable goal (relatively speaking) of a separate homeland using '67 boundaries and allowing the right of return for Palestinian exiles, has gone nowhere. Massive amounts of bloodshed later and they are no closer to a settlement. As the "leader" responsible to implement that Palestinian agenda, this failure to bring it to fruition in some meaningful way must rest squarely on his shoulders.  How to get out from under the 16 ton weight of letting your people down? Be assassinated by your enemy so that your egregious shortcomings and mistakes can be conveniently washed away by your own blood. Blood which will then have been magically transformed into that of a revered martyr who can be lovingly memorialized by his people as a brave freedom fighter who gave his life for "the cause". Rather than a blood-thirsty terrorist who evolved into a mediocre politician unable to reach the lofty heights required by the job, which is what he truly is.  So I ask the question again - What do Sharon and the Israelis gain by eliminating Arafat? It won't change a thing and it won't save any Israeli lives, in fact, it may lead to a whole new round of suicide bombings on behalf of their murdered leader. This kind of short-sighted, incendiary decision will be just as explosive (pun intended) as his ill-conceived visit to the Temple Mount several years ago that led to the launching of the current intifada.

       I definitely have  urlLink no tolerance  for right-wing Christians. They are a supremely annoying bunch, never ceasing in their endless quest to impose their own morals and beliefs onto the rest of society. Nor do they have any respect for personal beliefs other than their own. If you're really lucky, after a logic-free chat with them you might even get a smug little "Well, you are going to hell" when it's clear to them that you don't share the same reverance for a poor, blonde-haired, blue-eyed carpenter from the Middle East.   Kristof trying to argue that liberals should show equal tolerance for right-wing fundamentalist Christians as they do gays by making inane analogies is ludicrous. I submit as evidence:  Moreover, saying that one will tolerate evangelicals who do not evangelize — well, that's like Christians saying they have nothing against gays who remain celibate.   Horseshit! My gay friends don't sit me down and wax poetic about the wonders of gay life and how I should "switch teams". Fundamentalists do. Gays don't try to impose their own set of sexual choices on me. Fundamentalists do. Gays respect my right to be who I choose as I respect theirs. Fundamentalist Christians don't respect my choices and instead, pity me. Furthermore, what gay couples do in the privacy of their own homes is fundamentally different than some "Jesus Freak" ringing my doorbell and getting in my face, asking if I've accepted JC as my own personal saviour. I have yet to have my doorbell wrung by a well-dressed gay man hoping to extoll the virtues of sucking a man's cock. Except for once a year in West Hollywood during the Gay Pride Parade, my gay friends don't get in my face about their own sexuality.  I'll respect and practice tolerance towards right-wing Christians fundamentalists when they show respect for my beliefs and exude the same tolerance towards me. But they can't it's against their religion! Until then, they can all go to hell...

       Religious leaders in Saudi Arabia are  urlLink condemning  the recent terrorist attacks in their country in very strong terms.   Delivering his Juma sermon to the thousands of faithful who had assembled at the large mosque complex, the imam warned Muslims against following radical preachers promoting violence.  "We strongly warn you against heeding misleading edicts that promote extremism," Sheikh Sudais said, referring to radical Islamist preachers who give their blessings to militants to carry out terrorist attacks.  He said the attack had shocked every sane and humane person.  "Nobody will approve such a horrendous crime. It's a prohibited, nefarious, terrorist act."   Why don't we hear that kind of talk from imans in Iraq? Why don't we hear that kind of talk from imans everywhere about what is transpiring in Iraq? Muslims are killing muslims in Iraq as well. Yet in the case of Iraq, imams plead for the end of the occupation but not the terrorist attacks that kill so many innocent muslims. Was Saddam such a friend to Islam, other than paying lip-service to Allah? Are the Iraqi people freed from his oppressive regime not better off, if not in the short run than certainly in the long run? When suicide bombers in Iraq detonate themselves at police stations, also killing innocent children should that not be condemned in the strongest possible language IF, as claimed, Islam is a religion of peace? Should not what the imam said above be true no matter in what country the terrorist attacks take place? In order to be believable when making claims that Islam is a religion of peace, we must first see equanimity in the way it is preached.  You just can't have it both ways. Either your religion is a religion of peace or it is not. Either you condemn the killing of innocent people, regardless of who is doing the killing, or you don't. I'm tired of two-faced Islamic religious leaders condemning violence in their own backyard as in Saudi Arabia but then only condemning the US in Iraq. I have yet to see any proof that Islam is a religion of peace since no Islamic religious leader has stepped up and has been as outspoken about denouncing the terrorist attacks in Iraq, Spain, Bali or the US as they should be if Islam were indeed a religion peace. Actions speak louder than words, yet Islamic religious leaders aren't even willing to speak out. It is truly a blackmark against the Islamic religion and an opportunity lost for them to educate non-muslims as to what their beliefs are all about. Instead they are content to let the horrible images on TV shape the Western world's minds.

       The first "great sucking sound" was manufacturing jobs lost thanks to NAFTA. Now, as the  urlLink gospel of free trade  spreads around the globe and technology has shortened the distance between two places, manufacturing jobs continue to be "offshored" but there is a new twist as the new faces of job loss are also high tech jobs - programmers, coders, et al. If you pray at the alter of free trade then this is accepted as all part of the process. When asked about these developments the free-traders counter with "free trade will create many more new jobs  for us in the long run". OK, so now that our manufacturing base has shrivelled and we are exporting all of our high paying high-tech jobs what WILL be the next wave of jobs our "new economy" will create and in what new sector? More importantly, what is our government doing to stimulate and support new industries where those new jobs will be created? There has to be a strategy behind job creation and the government has to step up and accept its critical role in helping to nurture and support new industries through tax breaks and incentives.  Cheaper goods are a wonderful thing but should that be the ultimate goal of what our economy strives for? Might the ultimate cost to the American worker be disproportionately negative in the long run (cheaper goods but substantially lower wages as a result)? I'm not sure the "Wal-Martization" of the country is a good thing, on many different levels. As things have gone so far, we are devolving into a service-based economy where the bulk of wage-earners sadly need only to learn the phrase "Would you like fries with that?"

       The wit and  urlLink wisdom  of Pat Boone.  A healthy society needs censorship to survive, 1950s musical icon Pat Boone said yesterday. He added that he would welcome strong content restrictions governing movies and other artistic works.     "I don't think censorship is a bad word, but it has become a bad word because everybody associates it with some kind of restriction on liberty," said Mr. Boone, who is in Washington making the rounds as the national spokesman for the 60-Plus Association, a conservative senior citizen lobby.  Censorship bad? Naaaawwwww! Pat drops more science:  "Censorship is healthy for any society, and that goes for arts, entertainment, anything. Self-imposed means that the majority of people say that is what we want, and it can be changed if people's attitudes change, which is how a democratic society works."   Pat and Mel in "Lethal Apostle"? or "Once We Were Christians"?  A more serious meeting of celebrities was when Mr. Boone was invited to a private screening of Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ."     "After the screening was over, I turned and said, 'Mel, you're an apostle,' " said Mr. Boone, who has appeared in 15 films. "An apostle is one commissioned by God to tell the story and you are telling it more powerfully than it has ever been told or will ever be told, and you are therefore an apostle."

       The low-carb craze has swept the country. 10,000,000 people strong are Atkins devotees. Apparently, one of the ancillary effects, aside from less fat on an obese public, is a serious economic decline for bakers. Here's an interesting position:   American Bakers Association President Paul Abenante encourages his dispirited fellow bakers to keep their chins up, lobby hard and vote Republican.   What exactly does a low-carb diet, or a high carb diet for that matter, have to do with voting Republican or Democrat? Is the Bush Administration going to declare all out war on low-carb diets? Perhaps they will be adding some "carb-based" initiatives along with all of those faith-based ones? Maybe Ashcroft's Justice Department will pass the Yeast Act and all low-carb dieters will be targeted and rounded up, forced to live in legal limbo on Alcatraz and be fed stale dinner rolls three times daily?

       Next time you're in Barcelona, stop by the Baja Beach Club and be one of the first kids on your block to be  urlLink implanted  with a RFID chip!  Get an early glimpse at what awaits all of us at some point in the future, more than likely under the guise of "safety" and fighting terrorism.   "the VeriChip is a technology consisting of the implantation of a digital chip under the skin... The placement of this sub dermal chip is done with a syringe. Does this implantation method cause any troubles or side effects? "The chip is made of glass, totally innocuous and is implanted by a single-use, sterilized syringe."...  Baja Beach Club owner Conrad Chase wanted something unique to identify his VIP patrons. Other clubs had special jewelry or key chains, but he was looking for something special. After brainstorming, he came up with the idea to implant his VIP members with VeriChip's implantable microchip...  "We have a special zone at Baja beach Club where only VIPs are allowed, which has various exclusive services for these members.  We are the first discotheque in the world to offer the VIP VeriChip. Using an integrated (imbedded) microchip, our VIPS can identify themselves and pay for their food and drinks without the need for any kind of document (ID)."    "The objective of this technology is to bring an ID system to a global level that will destroy the need to carry ID documents and credit cards. The veriChip that we implant in the Baja will not only be for the Baja, but is also useful for whatever other enterprise that makes use of this technology."   (emphasis mine)    "Useful for whatever other enterprise that makes use of this technology."  When you consider the ramifications of that statement it's truly chilling. Being surreptitiously tracked by the chip under your skin by  anyone  with the technology to detect RFID tags, targeted advertising as you enter stores or walk down the street (see  Minority Report ), as well as a laundry list of other potentially intrusive, privacy-stealing uses that you'd barely be able to control just so you don't have to carry any cash, credit cards or a driver's license? Not really a worthwhile trade-off if you ask me.  Remember -  "technology has no loyalty"  - It can be used against you as easily as you can use it against someone else.

       I just learned about  urlLink "The Methuselah Tree" . This is a 4,647 year old bristlecone pine tree that's been around since the pyramids! Not only that but it's located in California, of all places, high in the Sierra Nevadas. And people think we have no history in California! We have something better than history, we have the oldest living tree in the world. Who needs Disneyland?  Of course, man being the effective destroyer of nature that he is, an even older bristlecone tree was cut down in 1964 by an unwitting student...   The 1957 Schulman discovery of old bristlecones in California brought much attention to the bristlecones in the Wheeler area. With park development in mind, the Nevada congressional delegation asked the National Park Service for a study of the area. Some initial research was done but months went by with no further movement.  A local group that included author-conservationist Darwin Lambert was established and together they formed the Great Basin National Park Association. Lambert and this group believed the bristlecones of Wheeler to be every bit as old as those in California and worked hard to get scientific research to the area. The University of Nevada showed some interest but money was short and the theory that the oldest trees were in the White Mountains of California left the group without the support they needed. Lambert and his friends were longtime travelers to Wheeler Peak, and many of its bristlecones were lovingly given names by members of the group: names like "Buddha" and "Socrates". One tree was named "Prometheus" (pronounced: Pra-me-thee-us) after the Greek mythical character Titan, who gave fire and arts to mankind but was chained to a mountain for thousands of years by the gods for doing so.  The Association failed to get the research project, but the colossal trees along with the great beauty of the area was enough to bring attention to the Advisory Board on National Parks who endorsed the area as worthy of consideration. Bills were introduced in both houses of Congress and their passing seemed imminent, but grazing, mining and hunting special interests intervened, and the legislation failed. Legislative efforts continued year after year without success.  One day, while reading a newsletter clipping from the University of North Carolina, Lambert was dealt an almost unbelievable blow. He had stumbled upon a story that escaped the public and conservationists alike. Late in the year of 1964 a young geographer, Donald R. Currey, a student at this university, who was working toward his doctorate, was in the Southwest searching for evidence of Ice Age glaciers. The Wheeler Peak glacier and related phenomena attracted him. When this student and his associate came upon the bristlecones at the timberline, they began to take core samples from several trees, discovering one to be over 4,000 years old! Needless to say they were excited, and at some point, their only coring tool broke. The end of the field season was nearing. They asked forand I still can't believe it!were granted permission by the U.S. Forest Service to cut the tree down. It was "Prometheus".  After cutting the trunk at a convenient level, which happened to be more than eight feet above the original base, 4,844 rings were counted. This student had just killed the oldest living thing on earth! Eventually, dendrochronologist Don Graybill determined the tree to be  4,862 years of age .

        urlLink Dateline France : President of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak -  "Today there is hatred of the Americans like never before in the region."   Oh, so now Muslims  really  hate us. That's comforting. Before, when a few of the more "fanatical ones" were just irked at us, they unleashed the most sophisticated and deadly domestic attack in our country's history. What is in store for us in the near future now that a larger percentage of Muslims hate us even  more  than before?!   It's been a while since Arab opinion was with the U.S., of course, but there's no question that events of late have sharpened the divide. Recent American iniquities include the United States' unequivocal support of Sharon’s disengagement plan, its tacit support for Israel’s assassination of Hamas leaders Yassin and Rantisi, and its punitive siege of Fallujah. Mubarak said what King Abdullah of Jordan was surely thinking when he called off a scheduled meeting with President Bush in Washington this week. The U.S. is playing it cool, but continued displeasure in the Arab world could spell trouble for hopes of peace in Israel-Palestine and Iraq.    The war on terror cannot and should not be fought solely by military means. Fighting "fire with fire" only really accomplishes one thing - more fire. We need to analyze our behaviour throughout the world, especially the Middle East, and realize that our actions not only speak much louder than our rhetoric but they have consequences that can imperil us all. That which we value the most about our society (in theory), our freedoms, is also what makes us so vulnerable to those who would seek revenge for any injustices we've committed, real or imaginary.  A consistent foreign policy based on human rights, fairness and respect for different cultures and forms of government would go a long way towards rehabilitating our image throughout the world. Do we want to lead out of fear or out of respect? Certainly, with our advanced technology and awesome military power it would be much easier to lead out of fear. So far, that's been the hallmark of Bush's foreign policy. Throwing our considerable economic and military weight around based on our own narrow, self-serving agenda is the intellectually, spiritually and morally lazy solution. It takes a truly enlightened government and nation to lead by  good  example and work hard for the global community's respect. Only as a last resort should we choose violence as a solution, and even then preferrably with multi-national support, rather than compromise our principles and take a shortcut to a desired result using force.

         Frontline   re-ran their 2002 program,  urlLink "The Man Who Knew" , on FBI terrorism expert, John O'Neill. Ironically, after tracking bin Laden for years and evolving into the most knowledgeable Special Agent on al Qaeda in the organization, he was eventually forced to resign from the FBI in August of 2001, primarily due to politics  and a personal dislike of his style by then interim FBI Director, Thomas Pickard. O'Neill got a new job soon after, as... wait for it... the Chief of Security for the  World Trade Center . Tragically, and ironically, the man most aware of and concerned by the al Qaeda threat to this country died on 9/11 as a direct result of their terror plot. I bought the program on DVD last night from PBS and I suggest anyone interested in this topic buy the DVD or VHS from  urlLink PBS  online.  FYI: You can watch the entire program online, including an extra 30 minutes only on the web,  urlLink here .

Not only is it expensive but the waste is voluminous. Old desktops and laptops don't get recycled, they get dumped in landfills, never to degrade. That ain't right.

       It's time for California's  urlLink "three strikes"  law to get the boot. Its foul existence is due to typical legislative over-reaction, drafted and passed after the tragic abduction and murder case of 12 year-old Polly Klaas. Judges, federal and state, have continually had their power eroded and it can sometimes lead to heavy-handed, cookie-cutter sentencing that offers no flexibility to judges that would like to take mitigating or extenuating circumstances into consideration when sentencing a guilty defendant.

       Kagan and Kristol, a nifty neocon duo, offer up an  urlLink accurate assesment  of our shortcomings in Iraq but they avoid criticizing the President directly, who is the one ultimately responsible for this current debacle in Iraq, and instead pin the "tail of blame" on Rumsfeld. Though even  that  is done gently, with the coup de grace being suggested only in the final sentence.  Look, Rumsfeld should be FIRED... NOW! If you or I had miscalculated this badly in our jobs we'd have been terminated with extreme prejudice. This guy went AGAINST the advice of most military PROFESSIONALS, who's jobs are to plan these exact kind of operations. Rummy shouldn't have lasted past the post-Saddam looting and pillaging. Inexplicably, he still has a job. His ego caused this problem and now his ego won't allow him to resign either, which is what any self-respecting professional would do following the unnecessary level of chaos, loss of life and destruction his strategy has resulted in. As for Bush, I admire loyalty. Bush supports his guys. Why else would Tenet still have a job for god's sake? Yet Rumsfeld's folly (or should it be Rumsfeld's Follies) is STILL affecting our ability to effectively stabilize and rebuild the war torn country of Iraq. Not to mention, he is STILL clinging to his feckless strategy. Meanwhile the natives are getting more and more restless, making the military's job harder and harder by the day. And when the military's job gets harder, more soldiers die than is necessary. Donald Rumsfeld should pay for this with his job, though I think they should also require that he give back all of his salary retroactive to the start of the war.  Get some more troops in country, quell this violence, speed up the rebuilding, start spending some of the reconstruction money that's been languishing in bank accounts unused, take more time and make a better effort at training the Iraqi Security Forces and do this nation building thing right. Oh, and while you are at it, make sure some high-level military heads roll over these "prisoners being tortured" revelations.

       I want my money back! Howard Dean looks to undermine, discredit and trivialize any lasting impact he made on the Democratic party by selling out and capitalizing on his meteoric rise through the political consciousness of America to become a  urlLink talk show host ? Next thing you know we'll be hearing about Al Gore and Al Sharpton dueting on American Idol as "Al B Squared".  Gov. Dean really has to consider how a silly move of this nature could damage the Democratic party and how the voting public might regard future Democratic contenders for office of the President. Dean was a serious candidate and to "go Hollywood" and host a general affairs talk show so soon after his all out quest to be the leader of the most powerful nation on earth really makes me question the man's decision-making abilities. In retrospect, perhaps it's all for the best that he was blown out early. I just never got the impression that Gov. Dean was such an opportunist.   Variety said Dean already has received one "substantial offer" to host his own talk show for an unspecified cable news network. Lyttle told Variety that Dean was leaning toward a more generalized talk-show format.  "The last thing we're going to talk about is politics," Lyttle was quoted as saying. "He'd look at things like: What happens if you lose a sibling? What about when you're victimized by not having health care?"  He added that Dean combined qualities of self-help guru Dr. Phil McGraw, veteran talk show host Phil Donahue and the fictional Howard Beale, the ranting anchorman from the movie "Network."   Unbelievable.

       The  urlLink latest development , with regards to e-voting, seems to be people are waking up and realizing that though much of our "democracy" has been co-opted by special interests and big business, we still had the power of our vote every 4 years. Yet with the clamor for change after the 2000 electi... errr coronation, new voting systems have been explored and developed to  theoretically  better serve the voter's intent. However, as people are waking up to realize, electronic voting machines are NOT the panacea they have been made out to be. Security issues, program glitches, systems improperly set up by election officials due to poor or insufficient training and finally, no valid proof - in the form of a paper receipt - for voters to confirm that their votes registered properly with the system have all contributed to the horror stories that have surfaced where electronic voting machines have been used. We are on the cusp of having the last bastion of our democracy stolen from beneath our very noses by the electronic invasion of the ballot box where none can confirm what  actually  went in.  It is very heartening to see that a California advisory panel has recommended that electronic voting machines not be used until security measures are enhanced and a paper-based record for voters is provided so they can verify their vote was counted as it was cast.  The advisory panel also urged California officials to require manufacturers of the systems to upgrade security measures to prevent hackers from tampering with votes. The motion specifically recommends new electronic voting machines be required to print paper-based vote records that voters could use to verify that their ballots had been cast as intended.  The motion comes amid a national debate about the use of electronic voting machines, which had been put forward as a way to avoid the kinds of punch-card irregularities that dogged the last presidential vote in Florida.  "Paper is coming to California," said John Mott-Smith, a member of the California Voting Systems and Procedures Panel. "It's not a question of if, but a question of when."  This is exactly the kind of pressure that needs to be applied to Diebold and other manufacturers of electronic voting machines so that they will produce equipment that will maintain the basic integrity of our democracy. What happens after we cast our vote and our elected officials get into office, well that's a whole different story to be addressed at some other time.

       A town in Florida (one of the nation's wealthiest, naturally) is setting up infra-red cameras to take pictures of the license plates of cars entering their town and will use computers to run  urlLink background checks  on every car and driver. That's just spooky. Could one could make a case (though I'm no lawyer) for unlawful search as there would be NO probable cause for a photo and background check to take place? The ACLU needs to get up into these town officials' faces. The ridiculous part is that all of this heavy-handed surveillance is being implemented over minimal fears.   Manalapan's town council authorized $60,000 in security upgrades last week after three burglaries this winter robbed residents of $400,000 in jewelry. The town averages two or three burglaries per year and residents demanded swift response, Town Manager Gregory Dunham said.   Two to three burglaries A YEAR and these people are ready to hand over their right-to-privacy?  It's this kind of "climate of fear" (though I hardly think 3 burglaries rate as that, bear with me I'm illustrating a point), however overblown or valid, which the media and government have been fomenting that convinces  relatively  sane people to willingly hand over rights that our forefathers fought and died over and had the wisdom to include in our Constitution (and the Bill of Rights). Government claims that they have to override or ignore these right because they need to keep us all safe (Patriot Act, Patriot Act II) are false, misleading and essential begin to unravel the very fabric that this country is made out of. A frightened populace is much more easily controlled and we seem to be tripping over ourselves under this illusion of "safety" our government is peddling to have every last one of our rights yanked away. I, for one, don't feel more safe despite the Justice Department's bogus claims and with our rights being slowly co-opted by needless government intrusion I would ask this: "Who's going to keep us safe from them?"  SPECIAL NOTE TO TERRORISTS: No annual  urlLink conventions  in Virginia Beach. Facial scanning is yet another bogus intrusion, one based on flawed "science", that doesn't even work for the purposes intended. However, I think it is a perfect metaphor for all of the privacy intrusions based on flawed "legal" measures, that don't keep us any safer either, yet still abrogate many of our inalieble rights guaranteed us by the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

       Big brother might start watching (and  urlLink reading ). Frankly, I could use the traffic. My two regulars just aren't enough to keep me going.  some analysts say U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials might be starting to track blogs for important bits of information. This interest is a sign of how far Web media such as blogs have come in reshaping the data-collection habits of intelligence professionals and others, even with the knowledge that the accuracy of what's reported in some blogs is questionable.   Questionable accuracy?!?! Why I NEVER!  I'll make a standing offer to any visiting G-men that they can get a free "FREE LEONARD PELTIER" button or "HEY, HEY, HO, HO, ROBERT MUELLER & GEORGE TENET HAVE GOT TO GO" sing-a-long kit while supplies last!

       This was a recent e-mail I sent to a close friend of mine as we were discussing "free trade" and "offshoring":  "Using the continuing loss of manufacturing jobs and the relatively recent development of offshoring high-tech jobs as examples, the main point I wanted to make was that the government needs to have a more effective strategy for how we can better compete in the global marketplace and be more active in nurturing and supporting new industries that Americans can be productive in. No question that a lot rides on education, though in that area I feel we are gradually falling behind. Not so much at the university level but the elementary school and high school level. Though low wages and tax breaks aren't the sole arbiters of where manufacturing jobs go, they do play a part in a free trade environment. Certainly our infrastructure and productivity give us an advantage but there are countries we are competing with that have evolving infrastructures that are beginning to rival ours. So though Bangladesh and sub-Saharan Africa don't really threaten us because of their relatively unsophisticated infrastructure and lack of educated workers, the same cannot be said of the East. Japan, Korea, India and the looming dragon, China, have all taken a bite and will continue to do so in the decades ahead. Not so much Japan and Korea anymore, whose economies have peaked and are suffering some stagnation due to their own economic policies but certainly India and most importantly, China. The Chinese have barely begun to tap into the vast potential of their economic engine and their infrastructure and education-level is growing every year. They are the primary threat to our continued global economic dominance.  Whereas this very well may be another "period of adjustment", it is not a "fait accompli" that the adjustment will inevitably be a positive one. That's old school thinking and we definitely face a stiff new challenge now that China is becoming a major player. Even now we are being affected as the rising cost of resources we import (like oil)  is due to increased global demand now that China is devouring ever increasing quantities to feed their own rapidly growing economy. My astronomical gasoline bills are a testament to that already. No longer will we be the primary market of consumption as our manufacturing base decreases and China's increases. There is obviously a cost benefit to being the world's economic engine and we stand to lose that status as China's economy grows and becomes more sophisticated. They also represent, after all, the world's largest market as well. One of the things we need to do is figure out what we can sell or provide to the Chinese that they won't or can't eventually provide for themselves. Staying one step ahead of the dragon will help us maintain our economic preeminence."  Here's an interesting  urlLink article  about Atul Vashistha, a leading proponent of offshoring (he cofounded a consultancy that facilitates US corporations' offshoring). He explains in no uncertain terms why US workers or the government cannot and should not try to stop the inevitable. It's a pretty harsh assessment but he's speaking the truth. It's the future and we'd better get used to it. We need to wake up, stop fiughting the inevitable and figure out a way to evolve and move forward.   Like it or not, Vashistha says, Americans are now part of a global competition for labor. With the advent of the Internet and high-speed telecommunications, virtually any job that can be done at a computer or over the phone can be moved to countries where wages are much lower. And U.S. companies that resist the trend, he says, will be swept away by rivals...  ... Every year, 30 million jobs are destroyed in the United States. Businesses go bust, companies downsize, factories automate. Some workers get pink slips; others retire and aren't replaced. In a good year, however, the economy creates 2 million more jobs than it consumes.There are no official data on the number of jobs sent offshore by U.S. companies, but some experts estimate the total to be about 300,000 a year. If they're right, the practice accounts for 1% of job loss in the U.S.  So why the fuss? Because the last three years haven't been good ones, leaving the economy 2 million jobs in the hole. And for the first time, it's not just blue-collar jobs that are being shipped abroad. Analysts estimate that as many as 14 million white-collar jobs are vulnerable.  The potential casualty list includes clerical workers, administrators, programmers, analysts, accountants, auditors, telemarketers, researchers, tax preparers, technical writers and even economists. In only a few years, this displacement of jobs has created a new class of anxious — even angry — Americans.   Here's the economist viewpoint on offshoring:   Vashistha's position reflects the thinking of many mainstream economists. A firm that hires a $20,000-a-year Indian programmer instead of an $80,000-a-year American is behaving no differently than a company that installs an assembly-line robot to replace several human beings. In both cases, profits and productivity improve.  The higher efficiency allows Americans to pay less for goods and services, they say, and living standards rise. In developing countries, the infusion of jobs allows the middle class to expand and buy more U.S. exports. American companies invest the profits in more innovative enterprises, generating new jobs for American workers. (Whether the new jobs pay as well as the old ones is a subject of considerable debate.)   But as Lou Dobbs, who recently interview Vashistha argued...  Vashistha: "We can't just put up our borders and imagine that these jobs will stay. In fact, companies are going bankrupt because they are not taking advantage of these lower co-markets…."  Dobbs: "So what you end up [with] is a race to the bottom…. This is the wholesale exportation of American wealth…. "  Vashistha: "What is happening today is, I think, this is the next evolution in the global economy."  Dobbs: "That's wonderful. Great evolution, if you believe that the United States should be shipping its wealth, its jobs, standard of living and quality of life to Third World countries where there are no regulations for environment, no regulations for labor, no standards that is a requirement here in this country."    Vashistha is right. Lou Dobbs is right. So what is our government actively doing to make sure US businesses can continue to be at the forefront of the global economic evolution? A long-term strategy is needed and it must be implemented ASAP before more American workers get ground up in the gears of a new global economic reality.

       Eric Schlosser, author of the excellent book,  Fast Food Nation , writes a well-reasoned  urlLink op-ed  in today's NYT about the harmless and beneficial effects of marijuana and the need for its decriminalization.  I've never understood all of the hysterics and hand-wringing over the use of marijuana. Study after study have noted the medical benefits of herb. The government's own studies, as far back as the 70's, show that it should be decriminalized. Yet all of the government's propaganda would have us believe that it's one of the most dangerous and lethal drugs available.  As someone who has dabbled in a bit of the chronic myself, I can say with firsthand knowledge that, with the exception of some unfortunate weight gain brought on by the "munchies", I have not experienced any negative side-effects. Not only that, I'm convinced that for the 2 years I used it regularly, my eyesight (nearsightedness) did not get worse. In the years before my regular marijuana use, both eyes degraded roughly .25 per year and in the 2 years since I quit, my eyes have degraded a total of .75 in each eye. It's almost enough to keep me enjoying the cheeba but I'd rather wear contacts and be fit than keep my eyesight at its current level and be fat. Call me crazy but those are my priorities these days.  Accusations about pot being a "gateway drug" and it being highly addictive are specious arguments. It's no more addictive than alcohol and one could argue it's not the drug itself that's addicitive but the person using it having an "addictive personality" or having other issues which cause them to use it as a crutch. Reason to make it illegal? I think not. Using that anology why are alcohol and cigarettes legal? As for claims that it is a drug that leads kids to experiment with harder drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, anyone who has smoked pot would understand that the feeling it evokes is the polar opposite of cocaine and hardly makes jabbing a needle in one's arm all of a sudden more appealing. Again, people who start experimenting with marijuana and eventually migrate to harder drugs would have ultimately gotten there with or without pot. The desire to experiment, or the desire to cope with problems real or imagined by using drugs and escaping reality is not fueled just by smoking pot.  Am I advocating the use of drugs? No. It's an individual's choice and it is a choice that should be exercised only by adults who can fully understand and handle the responsibilities of taking this kind of mind-altering substance, just like alcohol.  Finally, from a legal system standpoint, our jails are filled with offenders whose only crime was to be in possession of a little herb. I don't feel, as a taxpayer and citizen, that this is an effective use of law enforcement resources. Imposing stiff sentences on marijuana offenders does nothing to keep any of us safer and may achieve the opposite effect. It takes up precious jail-space that could be used to hold more dangerous and deserving criminals the full length of their sentences rather than releasing them early due to prison over-crowding.  As with all minor drug-related offenses, the focus should be on treatment and rehabilitation rather than incarceration. That would be my tax dollars at work in a more effective and positive way.

       Mainstream America really knew things had become untenable in Vietnam when Walter Cronkite declared the war unwinnable one fateful evening on his nightly news broadcast. Sure, I think many, if not most, already knew deep in their hearts and minds that with American servicemen deaths rising the writing was on the wall for our involvement in Southeast Asia, especially given the growing popular domestic unrest against the war. However, they preferred to continue living in denial, hoping for a miraculous turn of events. The same storm clouds seem to be gathering once again on the horizon, this time over the war in Iraq.  Personally, I find comparisons between the situation in Iraq and our experience in Vietnam intellectually lazy and more akin to "sound-bite journalism" than anything else. That said, I think we have crossed a certain threshold in Iraq where we will not be able to achieve the goals for the country that the White House was paying lip-service to at the outset of the invasion. Those who were supporters of the war but critical of the execution strategy (Gen. Shinseki, among others) were correct, we went in with too few forces to adequately impose our control and guarantee stability, post-Saddam. We subsequently failed to create a sufficiently stable environment in Iraq which unfortunately resulted in our inability to stop the early violence and looting, prevent the influx of foreign terrorists, effectively rebuild critical elements of the infrastructure in a timely manner in order to quell public dissent and to deny rival religious and ethnic factions within the country from pursuing their own agendas through violence and intimidation. Having trumpeted the smaller fighting force strategy from the outset, Bush, Rumsfeld, et al. cannot and certainly will not suddenly and dramatically increase troop levels to help establish what should have been the proper level of control in the first place. Yet without that control, we can expect a continual challenge to our efforts at rebuilding from forces that would love to see us fail, as well as a populace dissillusioned by the insufficient results so far.  As a result of their flawed strategy, the White House is now facing their own disillusioned populace at home. The growing concern over the war, in turn, effectively handcuffs Bush from significantly increasing troop strength in Iraq, as that would undoubtedly be a very unpopular move with the American public. This  is  an election year after all.  If we had gone in with sufficient troop strength we would most certainly be in considerably better shape with regards to nation-building, as would the Iraqi people as a whole. However, given our deeply flawed military strategy, I do not think we will be able to turn things around in Iraq. That essentially makes this war unwinnable, at least in terms of the humanitarian goals that we set out to achieve - namely, freedom and democracy in Iraq that could be a shining example to other muslims living in repressive regimes throughout the Middle East.  Oh yeah, Paul Krugman's  urlLink column , "What Went Wrong", in today's NYT is worth a read. As is an  urlLink editorial  in tomorrow's International Herald Tribune. They acknowledge the failures so far but they make a clear call for Bush to substantially increase troop strength. Here's an  urlLink editorial  by Niall Ferguson from last week's NYT that draws on a more relevant comparison than Vietnam.

       Here's an  urlLink AP article  which intimates that Secret Service logs show that they possessed a security camera video tape of the Oklahoma City Murrah Building explosion which shows a female accomplice waving the truck back into a parking space in front of the building and 2 men (one McVeigh) getting out of the truck minutes before it detonated. Yet the government always insisted that McVeigh acted alone. There were also eyewitness accounts that mentioned seeing the woman and  2  men getting out of the truck.  I can't understand why the government would purposely supress this kind of evidence and we'll probably never know. I can't even begin to fabricate a coherent conspiracy theory that would explain a motive, though coherence is certainly not a pre-requisite for conspiracy theories. It does make you wonder if there was anything more to that tragedy than we were ultimately led to believe.

        A recent study by   Program on International Policy Attitudes   (PIPA) shows that a majority of Americans still hold misperceptions about the war in Iraq. The study itself is entitled  US Public Beliefs on Iraq and the Presidential Elections  and can be found  urlLink here  (pdf file).  Some highlights as outlined by a Knight Ridder Newspaper article:   A new poll shows that 57 percent of Americans continue to believe that Saddam Hussein gave "substantial support" to al-Qaida terrorists before the war with Iraq, despite a lack of evidence of that relationship.  In addition, 45 percent of Americans have the impression that "clear evidence" was found that Iraq worked closely with Osama bin Laden's network, and a majority believe that before the war Iraq either had weapons of mass destruction (38 percent) or a major program for developing them (22 percent).  There's no known evidence to date that these statements are true.  U.S. weapons inspector David Kay testified before Congress in January that no weapons were found and prewar intelligence on Iraq was "almost all wrong." CIA Director George Tenet last month rejected assertions by Vice President Dick Cheney that Iraq had cooperated with al-Qaida.  Despite that record, many Americans continue to believe that the threat from Iraqi weapons and its alleged links to terrorism justified the war. That conviction correlates closely with support for the war and President Bush, the poll released Thursday found.  For example, among those who say most experts agree that Iraq had banned weapons, 72 percent plan to vote for Bush.  The poll for the University of Maryland's Program in International Policy Attitudes, conducted by Knowledge Networks from March 16 to 22, surveyed 1,311 adults and had a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points.  Claims by the Bush administration about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and links to terrorism helped shape public perceptions, said Steven Kull, the director of the program. No cause-and-effect relationship between the beliefs and support for the president could be proved, however.  In the poll, roughly 4 in 10 Americans perceived the administration as saying it had clear evidence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction just before the war.  The administration has backed off earlier claims that evidence of such weapons was found, but the president continues to say the weapons question is open. "We all thought he had weapons," Bush said Wednesday.  "We're so polarized right now that people are seeing what they want to see through a very partisan lens," said Thomas Mann, a political analyst and Brookings Institution scholar.  The PIPA poll did have several warning signs for the administration, as respondents have become more pessimistic about the prospects for success in Iraq.  The number of those who believed the year-old war would result in greater peace and stability in the Middle East has dropped from 56 percent in a Gallup poll in May 2003 to 40 percent last month in the PIPA poll.  And for the first time, a majority of Americans - 51 percent - said they thought that a majority of Iraqis wanted U.S. forces to leave. The survey was completed before the worst violence of the occupation erupted in April.  If the majority of Americans can still hold these substanially flawed beliefs, long after they have been discredited and disproved, no wonder polls show that a majority of Americans support President Bush's re-election. I'm prone to wonder, wistfully, what his support would  actually  be if everyone in this country took the time to learn  the facts . However, I suppose that's just too much to ask of people since the time it would take for them to collect even the most rudimentary information about what's going on in the world around them would mean they'd have to take time away from watching American Idol or whatever the reality show du jour is. Proving that TV truly is the opiate for the masses and as a result, this uninformed, uneducated mass of humanity is easily led by those who have an agenda not mecessarily in the public's best interest.

       The numbers aren't easy to find and barely any match up. Here's an  urlLink article  that quotes the Air Force as saying 11,000 evacuees have come through Andrews Air Force Base.  More than 11,000 medical evacuees have come through Andrews in the past nine months, the Air Force says.  Most, we suspect, from Iraq. But that's 8,000 more than the Pentagon says have been wounded there.  Most of those wounded in action come through the vast Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington.  The American public is, for the most part, unaware that the true casualty count of the war in Iraq may actually be higher than official figures suggest.  Here's another  urlLink article  that indicates a similar number but says the wounded came through Landstuhl, Germany. Landstuhl Regional Medical Center is the largest hospital outside the U.S. for troops stationed in Europe and the Middle East.  Some figures that have been briefly mentioned in the press fall in the range of two to three thousand. But in a story that received little national attention, the Pentagon reported last month that the military made over 18,000 medical evacuations - representing 11,700 casualties in the first year of war in Iraq.    As for Iraqi civilians, between 8,789 and 10,638 civilians have died since war began March 19, 2003, according to one group of British and American researchers that surveys media reports and eyewitness accounts.  Let's hope for our US serviceman, as well as Iraqi civilians, sake this madness in Iraq ends before too many more human lives are lost.

       First Los Angeles County banned lap-dancing (and then ultimately reversed their decision), now a fifth adult movie performer has  urlLink tested positive  for HIV. With most of the industry already shut down, this can only prolong things until the dust settles. No question there has to be sweeping changes to the content of adult cinema. Only the most underground and careless companies will produce skin flicks without the performers using protection or engaging in high-risk behavior. It's essentially the "Cinemaxing" of adult film. Pretty soon it will all be full nudity but with simulated action. Taking into consideration recent developments, it's readily apparent that I need to spend less time blogging and more time looking for a girlfriend... Pronto!  Here is the up-to-date  urlLink quarantine list . It's quite unsettling to look at as it makes you realize how closely connected so many people in this industry are. There's this whole 3-degrees of separation thing going on which means one person's irresponsible behavior or unfortunate accident can have an extremely negative ripple-effect throughout the industry.  No matter what you think of adult entertainment and the people who choose this line of work, these are human beings just trying to get by in the world and no one deserves to get sick or injured on their job, no matter what it is you do. They are moms, dads, sisters, brothers, daughters, and sons just trying to pay their bills, plan a future and hopefully make better lives for themselves. Now some will have an additional worry in their lives that no one should have to cope with.

       Major League Baseball  urlLink reversed  themselves before I even had a chance to rip them in my blog about advertising the new Spiderman movie on the bases in major league ballparks.  Spider-Man will not appear on the base paths after all.  One day after hearing the public and media outcry following the announcement of the alliance between the league and Columbia Pictures in conjunction with the summer release of "Spider-Man 2," Major League Baseball officials and Columbia Pictures executives decided to scale back the promotion.  The original plan, as announced on Wednesday, was to have a 6-by-6 inch "Spider-Man 2" logo on first, second and third base during interleague games played June 11 to 13. But, on Thursday evening, the two parties jointly announced that the logoed infield bases would no longer be a part of the deal.  Unfortunately...  Other parts of the promotion will be unchanged. Movie trailers will be featured on stadium scoreboards, the logos will be placed in the on-deck circles, and fans attending the games will receive "Spider-Man 2" foam fingers and masks. Movie branding will also appear on a ceremonial pitching rubber and home plate -- both of which will be replaced with the standard white variety once play begins.

       "Hi folks, it was all a big  urlLink publicity stunt  for my new movie!"  Michael Moore knew over a year ago that Disney would not distribute his film, yet this week he pretended to be outraged at their censorship. As it turns out, he may not have even had a deal for distribution in the first place, the deal with Miramax may have just been for financing. It's was a cheap stunt and it damages what little credibility he has. This is exactly how he handles making his films too, slanting information, not telling the full story so it appears like something it's not. This guy is no more credible than Rush Limbaugh. The two seem separated at birth, one raised by liberals, the other by a pack of wolves.  In an indignant letter to his supporters, Moore said he had learnt only on Monday that Disney had put the kibosh on distributing the film, which has been financed by the semi-independent Disney subsidiary Miramax.  But in the CNN interview he said: "Almost a year ago, after we'd started making the film, the chairman of Disney, Michael Eisner, told my agent he was upset Miramax had made the film and he will not distribute it."    Semi-independent Disney subsidiary? You are either independent or you are not. A company owned by Disney Corp. isn't semi-anything, it's a corporate beast. Silly me for forgetting what a bloated, lying, liberal windbag Michael Moore is.  Moore told CNN that Disney had "signed a contract to distribute this [film]" but got cold feet. But Disney executives insists there was never any contract.  And a source close to Miramax said that the only deal there was for financing, not for distribution .  So he's   still   not telling the truth! He never even had a distribution deal in the first place! Way to take the focus off an interesting subject, the Bush Family connection to the Saudis, and obscure it by your own lies and publicity stunts you horse's ass.  We'd all be better off  urlLink reading   House of Bush, House of Saud : The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties  by Craig Unger, rather than watching Moore's schlocky work.

       OK, so I never thought I would live to see the day when I actually blogged and linked to a Maureen Dowd  urlLink article . I think she's awful, except when she makes a series of good points, as she does today in her  NY Times  op-ed.  It seems nothing can make hard-core hawks criticize the war (even the request for $25 billion more). Rush Limbaugh compared the prison torture to "a college fraternity prank," like a Skull and Bones initiation.   How cynical and partisan do you have to be to read stories about torture, abuse and even murder and then reduce it all to the equivalent of a fraternity prank? That, in and of itself, is shocking and extremely irresponsible and yet, is it any real surprise? It's a perfect metaphor for how partisan things have gotten in this country, when simple human decency and compassion take a back seat to supporting one's ideology.   ...Senator Kerry jumped on the president yesterday for saying nothing about Crown Prince Abdullah's "outrageous anti-Semitic comments" that terrorists in Saudi Arabia get funds from "Zionists." The prince's remarks — and arrests of reformers — show that, far from transforming the Mideast into democracies that flower with love of America and Israel, the bumbling neo-cons have unleashed a rash of racism, revenge and hate.   Why do I get this eery tickle in the back of my mind that by 2010 Saudi Arabia is going to be Iraq Redux?  ...Colin Powell's chief of staff, Larry Wilkerson, tells GQ magazine that Wolfie is "a utopian" like Lenin: "You're never going to bring utopia, and you're going to hurt a lot of people in the process of trying to do it."   Truer words were never spoken by any member of the Bush cabinet.  Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, The Associated Press reports from London that "U.S. soldiers who detained an elderly Iraqi woman last year placed a harness on her, made her crawl on all fours and rode her like a donkey."   Seriously, reflect on the Bush Presidency, the war, these torture, abuse and murder stories and ask yourself "What has happened to our country?" How did it get hijacked and turned into this quivering mass of evil so easily? The more that transpires, the more wistfully I look back at the Clinton years as a '90's "Camelot" and I'm not normally prone to such romanticism.  And Douglas Feith, the defense under secretary who was in charge of Iraqi postwar planning and the secret unit that furnished prêt-à-porter intelligence to back up Dick Cheney's doomsday scenarios, told conservatives that the administration might set up an office to plan postwar operations for future wars.  Well, on the one hand, it would be refreshing to have a postwar plan. On the other: future wars???   OK, so Bush has "chided" Rummy about what's going on in Iraq but how has a man responsible for postwar planning (new oxymoron courtesy of the Defense Dept.) in Iraq kept his job? Then again, this is apparently an administration where a soldier kills an Iraqi detainee with a rock and simply gets discharged. No one in the tech or manufacturing sectors have "job security" but the fuck-ups costing scores of US and Iraqi lives in the Bush White House apparently do. Now THOSE are some jobs we should look into offshoring, or maybe it's just the people  in them  we should offshore.

       Where's a more engaged and critical  urlLink press ? No matter your political affiliation, too much of each party's lies gets reported by the press as assumed fact, without any serious analysis or critiquing on the media's part. This applies to the war coverage as well. This inevitably leads to the majority of people, who get their news from sound bites or simple headlines, having to try and sort through all of the claims and counter-claims by themselves. It's virtually impossible to figure out who's telling the truth, or more accurately, who's lying the least. Most people have lives to lead and don't have the time to do the research necessary to determine the veracity of each candidates claims and counter-claims or whether the White House is being straightforward with a semi-interested country. There are tough, complex problems facing us in the world today and we all need someone smarter than us to help us make sense of it all. Funny but most people used to rely on the press for that and most still do which is why they can't make much sense of how it all fits together. In order to avoid taking any sort of position they can be criticized on (except in op-ed pieces) and in an effort to appeal to as wide a segment of a rapidly shrinking readership as possible, they don't really bother to engage in critical, well-reserached daily reporting anymore and it escapes me how they could abandoned their responsibility in this way.   We have been pelted this campaign season with "news" -- such as the questions raised concerning President Bush's National Guard service, or the charges that John Kerry threw back his war medals -- that exists only as accusations, manufactured into story lines by the campaigns or their surrogates, and willingly swallowed up and then regurgitated by a compliant press.  That's in part because the campaigns have caught up with, and in some ways, passed, the press. Sophisticated political operatives understand all too well the limitations that the conventions of modern-day "objectivity" impose on reporters. They know that, no matter how outlandish the charge, the press will cover it for the most part as a he-said/she-said. That means that for voters who don't look closer -- meaning most voters -- the damage will be done. (If nothing else, the imperative to respond may keep the opposing candidate from talking about his preferred topic for the day.)  That's why a press that went further could improve the level of political debate. Having the major papers provide a dedicated, experienced team of thorough but fast writers to sort through the campaigns' competing claims and, when appropriate, offer judgment on them, would be a good start.   Exactly, but we all know they won't do it because there is no obvious incentive or substabtial boost to the bottom line.  On a related note, perhaps the media has finally decided to  urlLink step up  an report everything that's been going on with the war and not just tow the White House line, now that it is more than obvious that they've missed quite a bit.

       25 of the 35 cases of prisoner abuse being investigated are instances where the final result was  urlLink death . I don't mean to sound naive but I almost can't believe we are talking about our military and our intelligence services being involved in something so evil and despicable. I'll say it again, I'm truly ashamed of the actions our fighting forces have engaged in.  One thing is clear, this is NOT "a few bad apples" as has been put forth by Rumsfeld and right-wing spin doctors trying to do damage control. This kind of abuse, torture and murder is an  institutional  problem tacitly endorsed by those in charge in both the military and intelligence services. Generals and Directors have quite obviously been looking the other way while this type of behavior takes place in prisons and detention centers all over Iraq and Afghanistan.  This is also not some "new" phenomenon. Let's not forget, 2 years ago when "American Taliban", John Walker Lindh, was captured, they stripped him naked, bound his hands and feet and threw him into a pitch black container for 2-3 days before even attending to his medical needs. That right there tells you that those in power knew what has been going since day one of our "war on terror".  There needs to be a top-to-bottom review of how we have conducted ourselves during these two wars and officers, enlisted men and contractors involved in these types of dehumanizing and criminal offenses need to be punished to the fullest extent of military or civilian law. Which leads to another interesting question: Under what laws are the civilian contractors working under? They certainly aren't accountable under military law and I don't think Iraq even has a comprehensive set of laws on the books yet, US law does not apply in a foreign country, so how are they going to be held accountable for their crimes? (Here's an  urlLink article  in Slate which outlines what can be done to civilian contractors. Basically, they can lose their job and their company can lose the contract. Big deal. We're talking about human lives here.)  In addition, the White House has KNOWN about allegations of abuse going on in Iraqi prisons as early as December of last year, almost 6 months ago, yet they are suddenly expressing shock and horror now that photos have leaked and the secret is out. It certainly doesn't seem like they paid too much attention to what was going on until they were embarrassed into acting. So in reality, the blame and neglect extend all the way up the chain of command to the White House and the President. In essence, they sanctioned this type of behavior by doing absolutely nothing when informed that these types of activities were going on. That sent a message on down the line that it was business as usual when it came to abusing prisoners.  Shame on your Mr. President. The eyes of your countrymen, the eyes of the world, are now upon you and can truly see that the Emperor has no clothes. You are a liar and a hypocrite. As someone who claims to be a born again, god-fearing Christian you have to ask yourself - What Would Jesus Do? My guess is the answer isn't going to jibe with how you have led this country so far.

       Michael Moore's latest left-wing, propaganda-laden effort,  Fahrenheit 911 , which Miramax was poised to distribute, has been  urlLink shelved  by Miramax's parent company, the family-friendly and now censorship-friendly, Disney Company. Disney, it seems, does not want to be associated with the movie as it is, surprise, surprise, critical of the Bush Administration. Also of concern to imperiled Disney CEO, Michael Eisner, is how this new Moore movie might irritate the powers-that-be in Washington and put in jeopardy several lucrative tax breaks for the company.  Mr. Moore's agent, Ari Emanuel, said Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chief executive, asked him last spring to pull out of the deal with Miramax. Mr. Emanuel said Mr. Eisner expressed particular concern that it would endanger tax breaks Disney receives for its theme park, hotels and other ventures in Florida, where Mr. Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor.  "Michael Eisner asked me not to sell this movie to Harvey Weinstein; that doesn't mean I listened to him," Mr. Emanuel said. "He definitely indicated there were tax incentives he was getting for the Disney corporation and that's why he didn't want me to sell it to Miramax. He didn't want a Disney company involved."   Now Disney has been publicly "outed" in its, so far successful, attempt at censorship and the company has unabashedly taken a clear, right wing partisan position with regards to the type of content it supports. Can banning card carrying ACLU members and democrats from Disney-owned theme parks be that far behind?

       ...and I mean from the top down over this ever-widening scandal of Iraqi prisoner abuse and now  urlLink  murder  ! Who are we, as a supposedly moral and kind people, that we can allow this to happen?  A US soldier kills a prisoner, a human being, with a  rock  and all that happens is they are demoted and kicked out of the service? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Our entire military, as well as our entire country, should be ashamed and embarrassed that this travesty has taken place and was not only effectively ignored but the seriousness of the crime soft-pedalled by officers in charge of overseeing Iraqi and Afghani detainees.     An official said a soldier was convicted in the U.S. military justice system of killing a prisoner by hitting him with a rock, and was reduced in rank to private and thrown out of the service but did not serve any jail time.   What kind of message does this send not only to the Iraqi people but the rest of the world when it comes to our valuation of an Iraqi life compared to an American life? Demoted? Kicked out of the service? Sent home? With "tough justice" like that it's no wonder even more prisoners aren't killed by US servicemen! Kill a helpless human being, go home a free man?  When four mercenaries, or "independent contractors" (take your pick), were murdered and paraded around Fallujah, we invaded the city and killed scores of Iraqis, many innocent civilians. Yet when the US military's own internal investigation uncovers that at least 2 Iraqi prisoners have died while in custody, there are no serious repercussions for those who are responsible. A demotion and being kicked out of the Army? That's considered reasonable punishment for a crime of that hideous nature? The military officers involved in imposing that ridiculously light sentence should be court-martialed themselves, demoted and sent home. Instead, they've been  urlLink reprimanded  and their military careers apparently over.  This kind of excessive, brutal and barbaric behaviour by some of our troops and intelligence officials makes me sick to my stomach. It's unfortunate that a relatively small group of sadists and idiots can undermine the noble cause the rest of the military is pursuing in Iraq under very difficult and dangerous conditions. Furthermore, these actions only make it more difficult for their fellow soldiers to do their jobs, as it inflames Iraqis, understandably so, and creates a even more widespread hatred for the occupying troops.

       The beginning of this  urlLink article  in Wired really sets the tone for some of the problems we can expect to arise in this November's election cycle.  As alarm mounts over the integrity of the ATM-like voting machines 50 million Americans will use in the November election, a new federal agency has begun scrutinizing how to safeguard electronic polling from fraud, hackers and faulty software.  But the tiny U.S. Election Assistance Commission says it is so woefully underfunded that it can't be expected to forestall widespread voting-machine problems, which would cast doubt on the election's integrity.  The commission -- which on Wednesday conducts the first federal hearing on the security and reliability of electronic voting -- laments its predicament in a new report.  "We've found some deeply troubling concerns, and the country wants to know the solution," said DeForest B. Soaries Jr., a Republican and former New Jersey secretary of state named by President Bush in December to lead the agency.   How about California  urlLink banning  the Diebold machine and recommending fraud charges be filed against the company?  California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley ended five months of speculation and announced Friday that he was decertifying all electronic touch-screen voting machines in the state due to security concerns and lack of voter confidence.  He also said that he was passing along evidence to the state's attorney general to bring criminal and civil charges against voting-machine-maker Diebold Election Systems for fraud.  "We will not tolerate deceitful tactics as engaged in by Diebold and we must send a clear and compelling message to the rest of the industry: Don't try to pull a fast one on the voters of California because there will be consequences if you do," he said.  Shelley said the ban on touch-screen machines would stay in effect unless and until specific security measures could be put in place to safeguard the November vote.  "Revelations regarding touch-screen machines have shaken public confidence in this voting technology," Shelley said, referring to four computer-science reports released in the last year that showed the machines to be badly designed and vulnerable to hacking. "It is my foremost responsibility to take all steps necessary to make sure every vote cast in California will be accurately counted."   More  urlLink background  on the California Advisory panel's findings about the Deibold voting machine and the questionable business practices the company employed.  The state had conditionally certified the TSx in December so that counties that had already purchased the machines could use them in the March primary. But the company installed a last-minute peripheral device in several California counties that was still being de-bugged days before the March primary. The device, a smart card encoder that programmed voting cards to be used with the TSx, malfunctioned and produced major problems in San Diego and Alameda counties the morning of the primary. Several hundred precincts failed to open on time, thus disenfranchising voters who were turned away from the polls.  The decertification recommendation goes to California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley, who has until April 30 to decide how to act on it, a date that falls within the six-month advance notice that the state must give counties to take machines out of commission before an election.  The panel also recommended that Shelley ask the state attorney general to examine the possibility of bringing civil and criminal charges against Diebold for violating California election codes, which state that vendors cannot change software without notifying the secretary of state's office. The codes also say that no vendor can install uncertified software on voting systems.  Last November, the state discovered that Diebold had installed uncertified software on its voting machines in 17 counties without notifying state officials or, in some cases, even county officials who were affected by the changes.

This man, along with Bev Harris from BlackBoxVoting.org are the most outspoken critics of e-voting and have been effective in raising the level of debate. So much so that California recently banned more than 14,000 electronic voting machines made by Diebold for the upcoming elections because of security and reliability issues.

       Macedonia  urlLink murdered  6 innocent Pakistanis 2 years ago to show their solidarity with the US in the war on terror. It turns out, they didn't foil a potential attack on the US Embassy, these poor immigrants were framed and executed so that Macedonia could curry favor with the US.  "They were just economic migrants passing through Macedonia illegally to reach some European country to earn money for their poor families,"  Macedonian police have accused the country's former interior minister, Ljube Boskovski, of ordering the executions and also implicated three top associates, as well as a businessman and two police commandos.  "This crime is even more shocking and heinous because these murders were pre-planned and were committed to spruce up Macedonia's image as an ally in the war against terrorism," Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said in a statement.  And I was beginning to think only we had idiotic public servants that made, deadly, counter-productive decisions for our country.

       Lawmakers in LA want to  urlLink BAN  low-rider, belly-baring, jeans and pants. Failing schools, rising budget deficits, crime, terrorism, health care - none of these issues deserve to be priorities. No, state legislators have found the time to draft a law banning baggy, low-slung pants. Without question, the state legislator who that authored and introduced this bill should be voted out of office so fast the next time he's up for re-election, as should everyone who has voted or will vote in favor of such a ridiculous idea. They want to legislate fashion and taste in Louisiana. I'm sure law enforcement will be thrilled about having to enforce this particular law, should lawmakers be idiotic enough to pass it.  Moralizing claptrap like this is one of the many things that are wrong with state and federal government. FOCUS PEOPLE! How about spending more time coming up with solutions to REAL problems, than grandstanding on some bullshit issue just to get some ink in the local paper.

       Just a small  urlLink example  of the rhetoric being used regarding the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib Prison as summarized by a new weekly Spinsanity column in the Philly Inquirer online. Honestly, I find some on the Right's tendency to try and minimize what happened to detainees over in Iraq morally reprehensible. Rush Limbaugh in particular should be ashamed of himself but then again, I see no reason why he'd start now. Or maybe he is and taking the drugs was a way for him to cope with his shame.

       Mexican air force pilots  urlLink filmed  16 UFO's trailing their patrol with infra-red cameras. These UFO's were not visible to the naked eye but were clearly seen on the infra-red footage. Mexico's Secretary of Defense released the footage to the news media and the images, as seen on various US news programs were quite interesting.  Now here is a US news  urlLink website  that reports the story but then attempts to poke holes in it.   Further analysis of the video has cast some doubt on the story. The pictures shown are infra-red images that had to have been spotted by the infra-red operator and not the pilot.   So what if the objects were seen by the infra-red camera operators and not the pilots. That doesn't make them any less real and unexplainable.   Several experts consulted by ABC NEWS discounted the notion that the lights were really UFO's.   What does this mean? Who were the experts? What kind of "experts" where they? How did they arrive at their conclusion that the lights were UFO's? If these are not UFO's, what is their plausible explanation for the lights following the patrol?   And it turns out that the interviews were conducted not by a reporter but by a UFO enthusiast.   Does the fact that a UFO enthusiast interviewed the participants, rather than a reporter, change the fact that 16 mysterious lights were seen trailing the patrol? How does this make the incident any less-credible?   It just goes to prove that the truth is out there... but you have to watch out for fiction, too.   So the station is basically implying that this story is bullshit even though they did nothing to explain what the 16 mysterious lights following the patrol actually were. They didn't even offer any other possibilities. They just decided this account is fiction without providing any proof to support their supposition. Seems like the OFO enthusiast has more credibility than these supposed "news journalists".

       The gov't goes after scientist Wen Ho Lee for spying for Red China (I love using that old timer phrase) and end up proving nothing except some minor violations while ruining the man's career, yet when  urlLink two of their own , James Smith and William Cleveland, both special agents in the FBI's office for counterintelligence, each have an affair and share top secret intelligence with an "asset", Katherine Leung, a Chinese spy for a decade, they get slapped on the wrist or are allowed to retire maintaining their dignity.  This is the same type of "insider" treatment that all types of law enforcement and intelligence officials get because the agency doesn't want to deal with the "embarassment" of their people having compromised national security. Ultimately, this sends the message to any who would be inclined to sell out their gov't to a foreign power that the consequences of their actions will more often than not result in mere disciplinary action and lead no jail-time.  We need to do a better job of policing our own law enforcement and intelligence officials. Somebody needs to be watching the watchers.

       Not only were prisoners tortured but most were  urlLink innocent  of any wrongdoing.   Coalition military intelligence officials estimated that 70% to 90% of prisoners detained in Iraq since the war began last year "had been arrested by mistake," according to a confidential Red Cross report given to the Bush administration earlier this year.

       William Safire's  urlLink op-ed  in today's  NYT  is in support of Rumsfeld, where he claims, quite enigmatically I might add, that Rumseld has been a "highly effective" defense secretary. He and Bush must be drinking the same Kool-Aid.  Here Safire makes the dubious argument that Rummy has always been concerned with "prisoner's rights":   Shortly after 9/11, with the nation gripped by fear and fury, the Bush White House issued a sweeping and popular order to crack down on suspected terrorists. The liberal establishment largely fell cravenly mute. A few lonely civil libertarians spoke out. When I used the word "dictatorial," conservatives, both neo- and paleo-, derided my condemnation as "hysterical."  One Bush cabinet member paid attention. Rumsfeld appointed a bipartisan panel of attorneys to re-examine that draconian edict. As a result, basic protections for the accused Qaeda combatants were included in the proposed military tribunals.  Perhaps because of those protections, the tribunals never got off the ground. (The Supreme Court will soon, I hope, provide similar legal rights to suspected terrorists who are U.S. citizens.) But in the panic of the winter of 2001, Rumsfeld was one of the few in power concerned about prisoners' rights. Some now demanding his scalp then supported the repressive Patriot Act.   Yeah, Rumsfeld has proven that he's very much concerned with prisoner's rights, ask Jose Padilla, ask the hundreds in Guantanamo being held indefinitely and without judicial review or recourse of any kind.   Torture is both unlawful and morally abhorrent. But what about gathering intelligence from suspected or proven terrorists by codified, regulated, manipulative interrogation? Information thus acquired can save thousands of lives. Will we now allow the pendulum to swing back to "name, rank, serial number," as if suspected terrorists planning the bombing of civilians were uniformed prisoners of war obeying the rules of war?   Yes, please, let's trivialize what has been going on over in Iraq with regards to prisoner abuse by making an obtuse point about not being able to get information out of detainees anymore. Safire sounds like he's taking his lead from Limbaugh here and trying to not-so-subtley imply that these were prisoners of war and as such, don't deserve to be treated humanely. As if it is OK to rape, torture and kill because the ends (good intelligence and America's safety) justify the means.

       This is an encouraging development and one can't help but think it's directly related to our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. God, I sound like a neocon. Before you know it I'll be trapesing out to see lectures by Kagan and Kristol.   Arab foreign ministers Monday endorsed the concept of democracy and human rights in a document prepared for an Arab summit expected to take place in Tunis this month, the Algerian foreign minister said.  Abdelaziz Belkhadem told reporters after three days of talks at Arab League headquarters that the document also called for an independent judiciary and promoting civil society, and covered the status of women in the Arab world.  "The most important features of the draft declaration is that it asserts the need to develop the Arab system of government and civil society ... in the field of deepening the practice of democracy," Belkhadem said.   It would be nice to see some good come out of our war in Iraq.

       Our esteemed President has made a point to say that he doesn't read newspapers. Perhaps it is time he started because someone who could stand up this morning and say that Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, has done a  urlLink superb job  so far is frankly out of touch with what's going on in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the fact that he can continue to support Rumsfeld after his failed strategy in both countries is a testament to his lack of responsibility to the American people and a clear indication that this is about politics and getting re-elected in November and not about holding cabinet members responsible for their mistakes. The poor post-war planning alone should have been enough to get him his walking papers but now with the prisoner abuse scandal tarnishing not only our effort in Iraq to establish a democracy but our nation's reputation and moral standing around the world, his dismissal should be a foregone conclusion. Granted, our moral standing and reputation were pretty low at this point anyway but the scandal thoroughly undercuts us on a global scale. Every country will see those images and judge us in the harshest way, as they well should. I didn't think our standing in the world could be hurt any more than it already had been by rushing to war in Iraq but how incredibly wrong I was. This latest scandal will be devastating and sadly it is only the beginning. The call for Rumsfeld to resign or be fired may only be a dull roar at the moment but rest assured that when the full scope of the prisoner abuse is exposed and more photographic and video evidence is released or leaked to the media, the roar for Rumsfeld's head with be deafening.  The arrogance with which Bush governs is astonishing. No one in his cabinet has been held accountable for any of the failures that have transpired on his watch. 9/11 tragedy - no changes at any level. Bungled war in Afghanistan by letting bin Laden and Mullah Omar escape - no changes. A complete lack of foresight and preparation for post-Saddam Iraq which led to violence, death, looting and sabotage of critical infrastructure, and now large pockets of civil insurrection - no change. Now we have this latest scandal and all signs point to no one being held accountable... again. What is the point in being accountable for something if you are never going to be judged on the ramifications of a poorly done job? Rumsfeld must go and he should take his lap dog, Gen. Richard Myers, with him.

       The Abbott & Costello of neocons, Kagan and Kristol, chime in with their solution to the untenable situation in Iraq -  urlLink earlier elections . September '04 instead of January '05. This way, the natives will be revolting against the beauty of democracy, instead of the evil of American occupation.   Among the biggest mistakes made by the Bush administration over the past year has been the failure to move Iraq more rapidly toward elections. It's true that many, inside and outside the administration, have long been clamoring to hand over more responsibility to Iraqis, responsibility above all for doing more of the fighting and dying. But the one thing even many of these friends of Iraq have been unwilling to hand over to Iraqis is the right to choose their own government. This is a mistake.   Among the biggest mistakes? No doubt there are a litany of big mistakes the Bush administration has made so far but I don't think foisting elections on an unprepared country is the answer to our problems. That said, the dynamic duo make some salient points.   We strongly doubt that the announcement of a new interim government--three to four weeks from now, to take office almost two months from now--will have sufficient impact on Iraqi public opinion to overcome the images of American soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners. Nor do we believe the present course will give the American people and their representatives sufficient reason to hope that a corner may be turned in the near future.   Agreed but neither would a debacle of an election that would only lead to radicalizing tribal factions that can't even be controlled now. The realization that their power and influence will soon be diminished will only lead to greater outbreaks of violence and resistance. We are unable to control the country now, if things were to reach a wider boiling point we would loose total control of the situation.   In addition to setting a new date for elections, the administration would have to do a couple of other things. It would have to increase, substantially, the number of troops in Iraq in order to create a more secure environment for elections. Rep. John Murtha has been attacked by Republicans for insisting that we are unlikely to succeed in Iraq without a big increase in the number of troops. These attacks on Murtha are stupid, because he is absolutely right. The Pentagon continues to fiddle while Iraq burns. Everyone in Iraq with whom we talk bemoans the shortage of troops and equipment. It is now impossible to travel safely throughout most of Iraq. This is terrible news, and would be even if we weren't preparing for an election. But if elections are announced, the Pentagon could be forced to overcome its arrogant stubbornness and beef up the force.   More troops are needed regardless. I'm not entirely sure why but our military capability seems to be stretched awfully thin with just 135,000 troops in Iraq and about a tenth as many in Afghanistan. National Guardsmen are being held long past their tour of duty and the idea of reinstating "the draft" is starting to be bandied about by some of our esteemed legislators. Regardless, experienced troops are needed to help stabilize the country so that when we  do  hand over the country to a democratically elected government, they have a real honest chance of succeeding. Not some hot potato hand-off so that we can cut our losses and pull out with some dignity, though after the ever-widening prisoner abuse scandal, the idea that we could salvage any sort of dignity or pride out of this operation has all but vanished.   As we say, this proposal is not a cure-all. It carries its own risks as well as benefits. If someone has a better idea, we're happy to hear it. But if the administration does not take dramatic action now, it may be unable to avoid failure.   Indeed, this is certainly no cure all. In fact, I think it is yet another bad idea in what has been a string of bad ideas from the neoconservative elements in and around The Beltway. I do agree with Frick & Frack in one decisive way - if the administration doesn't take dramatic action right  now , it will be unable to avoid the failure that is already staring us right in the face. That won't make any of us safer, which is what this was supposedly all about in the first place.

       Sy Hersh pens a deeply disturbing  urlLink article  for  The New Yorker  outlining the scope and extent of prisoner abuse in Iraq. Rumsfeld said that he had not actually looked at any of the Abu Ghraib photographs until some of them appeared in press accounts, and hadn’t reviewed the Army’s copies until the day before. When he did, they were “hard to believe,” he said. “There are other photos that depict . . . acts that can only be described as blatantly sadistic, cruel, and inhuman.” Later, he said, “It’s going to get still more terrible, I’m afraid.” Rumsfeld added, “I failed to recognize how important it was.”  NBC News later quoted U.S. military officials as saying that the unreleased photographs showed American soldiers “severely beating an Iraqi prisoner nearly to death, having sex with a female Iraqi prisoner, and ‘acting inappropriately with a dead body.’ The officials said there also was a videotape, apparently shot by U.S. personnel, showing Iraqi guards raping young boys.”   American soldiers "have sex with" a female Iraqi prisoner but Iraqi guards "rape" young boys. Let's be clear - the female Iraqi prisoner was raped, just like the young boys. Just because it was Americans doing it doesn't mean it wasn't rape. Talk about racist spin on the events in the prison.  Also illuminated in the piece is the DOD and Pentagon's "head in the sand" approach to both the war in general and the mushrooming prisoner abuse scandal. The Pentagon official told me that many senior generals believe that, along with the civilians in Rumsfeld’s office, General Sanchez and General John Abizaid, who is in charge of the Central Command, in Tampa, Florida, had done their best to keep the issue quiet in the first months of the year. The official chain of command flows from General Sanchez, in Iraq, to Abizaid, and on to Rumsfeld and President Bush. “You’ve got to match action, or nonaction, with interests,” the Pentagon official said. “What is the motive for not being forthcoming? They foresaw major diplomatic problems.”  Secrecy and wishful thinking, the Pentagon official said, are defining characteristics of Rumsfeld’s Pentagon, and shaped its response to the reports from Abu Ghraib. “They always want to delay the release of bad news—in the hope that something good will break,” he said. The habit of procrastination in the face of bad news led to disconnects between Rumsfeld and the Army staff officers who were assigned to planning for troop requirements in Iraq. A year ago, the Pentagon official told me, when it became clear that the Army would have to call up more reserve units to deal with the insurgency, “we had call-up orders that languished for thirty or forty days in the office of the Secretary of Defense.” Rumsfeld’s staff always seemed to be waiting for something to turn up—for the problem to take care of itself, without any additional troops. The official explained, “They were hoping that they wouldn’t have to make a decision.” The delay meant that soldiers in some units about to be deployed had only a few days to prepare wills and deal with other family and financial issues.  The same deliberate indifference to bad news was evident in the past year, the Pentagon official said, when the Army conducted a series of elaborate war games. Planners would present best-case, moderate-case, and worst-case scenarios, in an effort to assess where the Iraq war was headed and to estimate future troop needs. In every case, the number of troops actually required exceeded the worst-case analysis. Nevertheless, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and civilian officials in the Pentagon continued to insist that future planning be based on the most optimistic scenario. “The optimistic estimate was that at this point in time”—mid-2004—“the U.S. Army would need only a handful of combat brigades in Iraq,” the Pentagon official said. “There are nearly twenty now, with the international coalition drying up. They were wildly off the mark.” The official added, “From the beginning, the Army community was saying that the projections and estimates were unrealistic.” Now, he said, “we’re struggling to maintain a hundred and thirty-five thousand troops while allowing soldiers enough time back home.”   Deliberate indifference to bad news sounds like grounds for a firing to me.

       Cheney defends Rummy by saying he's the  urlLink  best   Secretary of Defense ever? What planet is he living on? What war is he flashing back to? Iraq is in turmoil. We've got rampant prisoner abuse, the worst of which the Sec himself says we haven't seen yet. There is no one to hand the Iraqi gov't over to at the end of June, no WMD were ever found, not enough troops were sent to do the job, Afghanistan (our "other" war) is also a mess and he still supports a "missile shield" defense strategy which is pure fantasy. With that list of "accomplishments", tell me something he's done  well  while Secretary. Rumsfeld was a relic who's time had passed and he was generally acknowledged as being on the way out when his job was  saved  by the 9/11 tragedy and the resulting (mismanaged) wars. Yet both wars have been poorly strategized and executed, with no stability having been generated at all for either country. We're not safer, in fact, there are  urlLink new fears  of a dirty bomb attack being launched in an American or European city by al Qaeda.   The threat of attack is great enough that a senior European intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it is "not a matter of if there is a nuclear-related attack by Al Qaeda, but when it occurs."  The warning echoed remarks made last June by Eliza Manningham-Buller, director of Britain's domestic intelligence service, MI5. She said renegade scientists have aided Al Qaeda's efforts to develop chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, sometimes referred to as CBRN.  "Sadly, given the widespread proliferation of the technical knowledge to construct these weapons, it will only be a matter of time before a crude version of a CBRN attack is launched at a major Western city and only a matter of time before that crude version becomes something more sophisticated," she told a London think tank.

       The NeoCon ideology that is rife throughout the Pentagon and the many lies used to support its premises got us in to this shameful quagmire of a war in Iraq, now it turns out that those who duped the American public through lies and manipulations were they themselves duped by Iran, Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress. It seems that the INC was  urlLink being run by Iran  and was used for  years  to feed the US false information and to gather sensitive intelligence on what we were up to in the Middle East with regards to Iraq. In essence, the $340,000 per month we were paying Chalabi and his ragtag bunch of Iraqi ex-pats was really helping Iran fund it's intelligence operation against us! Touché Ayatollahs!  The more we learn about what's really going on, the more it seems that this NeoCon cabal, which is the true "power behind the throne" at the Pentagon and in Washington, are all a bunch of misguided, power-hungry ideologues who apparently aren't too sharp.  The Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded that a U.S.-funded arm of Ahmad Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress has been used for years by Iranian intelligence to pass disinformation to the United States and to collect highly sensitive American secrets, according to intelligence sources.  ... Patrick Lang, former director of the intelligence agency's Middle East branch, said he had been told by colleagues in the intelligence community that Chalabi's U.S.-funded program to provide information about weapons of mass destruction and insurgents was effectively an Iranian intelligence operation. "They [the Iranians] knew exactly what we were up to," he said.

       Hey Bush! Keep your goddamn hands of my organic produce and organic meats! The multi-national corporate stooges, also know as the Bush White House, are insidiously re-working organic food laws to make them more palatable (no pun intended) for huge corporate farms. The USDA has unilaterally, and without any public discussion or review by the National Organic Standards Board,  urlLink diluted its National Organic Program .  As someone who tries whenever possible to buy organic produce and meats not contaminated with antibiotics or growth hormones, this undermining of organic standards without soliciting any input the appropriate advisory groups is galling and jeopardizes tens of millions of people's long term health who buy certified organic produce and meats.  Clearly large scale agribusinesses have felt threatened by the growing popularity of organic foods and the USDA, like many other departments inside the Bush Administration, are merely lackeys for the specific corporate interests they are supposed to oversee and regulate. The changes in these organic regulations will make it easier for large corporate operations to "claim" their products are organic, when in fact they are not.  Who is watching out for the public? Never in my life have I felt so unrepresented and so exploited by my own government. The Bush White House has elevated "serving one's corporate masters" to an exact science and the public has been giving not even a single a thought in the process. What will be left of our environment, food and civil rights when this evil bastard is finally expelled from office? I'm not sure I can take another 4 years of this "multi-national toady" behaviour by this administration.

       A cellphone directory is now being  urlLink compiled  which is expected to incude 75% of the 163 million mobile phones in the United States. Of course the industry is touting the convenience angle - customers being able to call directory assistance to get the number of a friend, mobile professionals who would like clients or customers to be able to call and get their number, but how many of us don't already have our friends' numbers or important numbers programmed into our cellphones already? How many of us would be willing to give up the peaceful right of privacy and anonymity we currently enjoy with our cellphones?  I, for one, use my cellphone as my primary phone line since my land line was getting inundated with hispanic marketing calls. Since cellphone numbers have been private up until now and have never been listed, I do not get any unwanted sales or marketing calls. That is beginning to change though and I do occassionally get text messages for loan rates on my phone. Annoying, for sure, but not yet at a volume that is terribly distracting. With the publication and inevitable exploitation of a cellphone directory, the relative peace and privacy of our collective cellphone universes will be forever shattered.  Of course, making it an "opt-in" service would be acceptable. I'm sure there are many lonely people out there who would enjoy the contact but after those 200 people agree to opt-in, what about the rest of us? Another disturbing fact is that many cellphone providers already have language built in to their usage agreements that allow them to publish your number. Of course, just like their landline brethren, you know they will not miss an opportunity to CHARGE you a "small fee" to "opt-out" of the directory, which is nothing short of highway robbery. Plus, it won't really work. I was unlisted with my home phone number and I still got a voluminous amount of marketing calls between 7pm and 10pm.  Verizon seems to be the only sane company (I never though I'd say that) as they have expressed scepticism at the directory idea. Any company who opts-out of participating in this cellphone directory is going to find a HUGE influx of new customers over a very short time span. It would actually be a very savvy business move if they can resist the potential revenue temptation of sharing their cellphone numbers with the directory.  Here's hoping lawmakers step up to the plate and squash, or modify, this idea before it takes root and we are unable to escape marketing messages anywhere on anything we communicate on.

       A few athletes die from taking too much ephedrine and the US Congress gets their panties in a wad and bans the substance. Meanwhile, multi-national drug companies peddle various types of unsafe drugs that have been well documented to  urlLink harm people  and yet getting those kinds of deadly drugs off the market is next to impossible and Congress seems to care less. I can't imagine it has anything to do with how much money pharmaceutical companies and their lobbyists/PACs donate to lawmakers every year. So far, in 2004, the Pharmaceutical industry has contributed over $7,000,000. In 2002 they donated just over $29,000,000, which put them in the Top 10 of campaign and party contributors. To think this doesn't buy influence and special treatment is wildly naive and contrary to the facts. How else can we explain all of the poorly-tested, harmful drugs still being peddled by pharmaceutical companies?

       Who would have thought that conduct during the Bush Administration would make Bill Clinton's blowjob party in the oval office seem silly and unimportant in the scope of the big picture? Now we are learning that the "few bad apples" excuse being proffered by the military, the Bush Administration and Republican Party loyalists fosters about about as much believability as "I didn't inhale".  Abuse, torture, mutilation, death. Here come the  urlLink war crimes !  a NEWSWEEK investigation shows that, as a means of pre-empting a repeat of 9/11,  Bush, along with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Attorney General John Ashcroft, signed off on a secret system of detention and interrogation that opened the door to such methods . It was an approach that they adopted to sidestep the historical safeguards of the Geneva Conventions, which protect the rights of detainees and prisoners of war. In doing so, they overrode the objections of Secretary of State Colin Powell and America's top military lawyers—and they left underlings to sweat the details of what actually happened to prisoners in these lawless places. While no one deliberately authorized outright torture, these techniques entailed a systematic softening up of prisoners through isolation, privations, insults, threats and humiliation—methods that the Red Cross concluded were "tantamount to torture."   The Bush administration created a bold legal framework to justify this system of interrogation, according to internal government memos obtained by NEWSWEEK.  What started as a carefully thought-out, if aggressive, policy of interrogation in a covert war—designed mainly for use by a handful of CIA professionals—evolved into ever-more ungoverned tactics that ended up in the hands of untrained MPs in a big, hot war. Originally, Geneva Conventions protections were stripped only from Qaeda and Taliban prisoners. But later  Rumsfeld himself, impressed by the success of techniques used against Qaeda suspects at Guantanamo Bay, seemingly set in motion a process that led to their use in Iraq, even though that war was supposed to have been governed by the Geneva Conventions . Ultimately, reservist MPs, like those at Abu Ghraib, were drawn into a system in which fear and humiliation were used to break prisoners' resistance to interrogation.  Clinton's amoral behaviour in office merely shamed himself. Bush's amoral behaviour in office shames us all.

       You knew it was going to happen. Vociferous  urlLink supporters  of the Bush Admin, under heavy fire recently over the prison abuse scandal, the burgeoning knowledge that perhaps it was systemic, not just a few "bad apples" and that Rumsfeld had approved broader interrogation techniques, are jumping all over this recent revelation that an I.E.D., that the military was trying to disarm but instead exploded, contained the nerve agent- Sarin. One errant shell, after 15 months worth of searching, and one we didn't even FIND, and the right-wingers are claiming it as proof of the WMD that we went in to save the world from. It would be funny if the tragic consequences of our invasion weren't so readily apparent.  Safire is also trying to re-connect al Qaeda to Saddam's regime, using the recent influx of foreign terrorists and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's current reign of terror as proof he supported them. Yet it's been shown that there were no credible links between Iraq and al-Qaeda, they were ideological enemies and that it is only post-invasion that al-Qaeda and other terrorists have flooded into Iraq to meet the "Great Satan" head-on in a region they can have easy access to and blend in much more effectively.  Those of us who were opposed to this war and who are now critical of how the Bush Admin has implemented it so far are being called "defeatists" by Safire. Like many right-wingers, he's trying to impune the left's and the many other dissenter's patriotism because we dare be critical of this boondogle in Iraq. I say it's a patriot that tries to save his country from his government! Our government is out of control and has embarked on an ill-advised and failing post-war strategy. We enacted regime change in Iraq and as has been said in the past, we need to enact regime change here in the US come November.

       Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator, fired by the department 2 years ago for being a whistle-blower about what the FBI knew prior to 9/11 about al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and a plot to fly planes into a major structure has been  urlLink effectively squelched  by a Justice Dept. gag order that classifies as "secret" what she has to say. Not only that, they've made it   retroactive   so that statements she made in public over the past 2 years, to journalists, to Congress, are also now classified. She can't talk about them, journalists can't write about them, Congress can't ask about them. Again, it feeds into the paranoia and conspiracy theories that the government is hiding something that would either embarass the Bush Administration or shed some different light on what we are being told in regards to the "war on terror".  I blogged about Sibel Edmonds earlier this year, in a previous incarnation of this blog, with a link to an interesting Salon.com article. Unfortunately, it's gone.

       During WWII we put Japanese-Americans in internment camps. Now, during our "war on terror", it is ordinary, everday  urlLink US citizens of Arabic descent  who are being physically and verbally harassed by overzealous, ignorantly racist elements in law enforcement, as well as in the general public, all because of some radical fundamentalist fringe groups that preach a twisted version of Islam.  It is a sad and sobbering realization at just how poor race and ethnic relations are in this country when a small group of muslim fanatics, clearly non-representative of the majority of muslims, have such a profound impact on how a large segment of citizens in this country subsequently choose to deal with people of that religion or of Arab descent. The majority of white people in this country have convinced themselves that "things are much better" and that racism and inequality are becoming relics of the past but nothing could be further from the truth. In many ways, racism is no less intrenched in American society than in the 1950's, it has just taken on newer, more subtle forms and most "new milliennium racists" work hard to keep their true feelings from view. Yet I do not want to make this just a white vs. Arab scenario, as it is certainly the case that too many Americans of ALL colors and ethnicities have a newfound fear and not-so-subtle racist attitude towards all things Islamic and Arabic.  My only hope is that we continue to self-examine our negative actions and reactions and try to learn and grow from the experience. Fear and ignorance can be overcome by education and understanding. As we struggle to become a better society, we must acknowledge our faults and weaknesses and commit to be vigilant in always trying to improve and overcome them.

I know Bush is loathe to increase the already astronomically high job-loss number but hanging on the people who just can't do their jobs well (Rumsfeld, Feith, Tenet, Rice) isn't really the answer. No one is held accountable in this administration and it seem the only way to lose your job is to not religiously tote the ideological line (Whitman and O'Neill).

       The imperialist-lite dogma of the neo-conservatives is proving to be their achilles heel. It's starting to look like calling someone a "neo-conservative" is the equivalent to calling them a  urlLink "foreign policy simpleton" , naive about dangerous world realities. It's about time.   Shortly after September 11, Sir Michael Howard, the British military historian, issued what sounded then like an apocalyptic warning: that in the context of the "war of civilizations" between radical Islam and the West a US occupation of Iraq would be tantamount to a nuclear exchange between the superpowers during the Cold War. It sounds like realism now. The fallout from the photographs will poison Muslim minds against the US, and possibly against democracy, throughout this century. Before the war, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak cautioned that a US invasion of Iraq would create "a hundred Bin Ladens." That is likely to prove a conservative estimate.  As for US credibility beyond the Middle East, a friend writes: "I'm guessing that another result of this adventure is that much of the world will now see us as a paper tiger (which has both good and bad aspects). After seeing how incapable we are, with our 135,000-man army, of dealing even with a weak, backward little country like Iraq, is any heavily armed tyrant quaking in his boots? All we can do is blow up things. Don't our hinted warnings to China (China!) about Taiwan sound hollow now? If China decides to take Taiwan, we will ... what? Send Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle over there with a company of Marines?"  Paradoxically, the very scale of the debacle in Iraq may yield one long-term good: the repudiation of neo-conservative "democratic imperialism." The Americans killed in Iraq will not have died in vain if their sacrifice keeps other Americans from dying in neo-con wars to "remediate" Syria, Iran, or North Korea. After Iraq, "neo-conservative" may achieve the resonance of "isolationist" after World War II—a term of opprobrium for a discredited approach to foreign policy, shorthand for dangerous innocence about world realities. Like the isolationists, the neo-cons are history's fools. The strategy they championed was the wrongest possible strategy for the wrongest possible moment in the wrongest possible region of the world.

        urlLink Yet another fine lesson in the specious application of The Patriot Act by the defenders of liberty in the F.B.I.  Ashcroft recently announced a new terror threat from al-Qaeda.  He can't tell us who the terrorists are, when they will be striking or what they will be targeting this summer, only that they WILL be trying something sometime soon. So, during this new climate of fear, they are allocating the precious anti-terrorism resources of the F.B.I. to cracking down on a deadly domestic terror cell know as the  Critical Art Ensemble . A nefarious gang of art professors at various universities who have the  temerity  to exercise their right of free expression in this country by producing provocative art. Yes, by all means, please save me from art professors with provocative art because that is far more threatening than any bumbling, keystone cops-esque al-Qaeda cell hell bent on killing thousands of people in the continental US. Our tax dollars at work ladies and gentlemen!  It is my strong suggestion that both Attorney General Ashcroft and F.B.I. Director Mueller take a page out of George Tenet's handbook and pre-emptively announce their resignation for "personal reasons" (a.k.a incompetence).

       Not only does President Bush mangle the spoken word but apparently he also single-handedly changes the meaning of a word to suit his needs. For example, regarding the resigning CIA Director, George Tenet:   urlLink "He's done a superb job on behalf of the American people," Bush said.  Now when you've presided over an agency responsible for gathering foreign intelligence against potential threats against the United States and yet tremendous intelligence lapses occur (9/11 tragedy, calling the war against Iraq a "slam dunk" because of their WMD, to name just two), thus calling into question the CIA's ability to function properly, in what  possible  context could that be considered a "superb job"? Unless, of course, Bush meant "superb" in the "incompetent, arrogant and derelict" version of the adjective.

And STILL no one in the Pentagon has lost a job!!!!! All of this truly begs the question -   What exactly do you have to do to get fired from that place?!?!   You'd swear these guys were all "union" the way they hang on to these jobs!

        The Post  is accusing the Bush campaign of "unprecedented negativity and mis-leading attacks."  urlLink Read the article  and all you can possibly come away with is that the Bush cmapign is   LYING   about Kerry's record and political positions. Is sugarcoating the language supposed to represent journalistic integrity or neutrality. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck - IT'S A DUCK! Say the words -  "Bush Is A Liar."  He proves it every time he opens his mouth. Can you expect his re-election campaign to behave any differently?

       It's unbelievable that some people who consider themselves "patriots" or "good Americans" also are the first to shutdown citizens' rights such as freedom of expression and free speech. When I read this  urlLink story  of student censorship and subsequent retribution against their teacher I was aghast that things like this are happening in our country and that actions such as these aren't immediately and widely denounced by people who cherish and understand what it really means to be an American. Anyone who thinks that banning dissent or provocative viewpoints that challenge their own beliefs is in any way, shape or form American needs to go back to high school and take remedial US History 101. All forms of intolerance need to be eradicated from our society - that's American. Bill Nevins, a New Mexico high school teacher and personal friend, was fired last year and classes in poetry and the poetry club at Rio Rancho High School were permanently terminated. It had nothing to do with obscenity, but it had everything to do with extremist politics.  The "Slam Team" was a group of teenage poets who asked Nevins to serve as faculty adviser to their club. The teens, mostly shy youngsters, were taught to read their poetry aloud and before audiences. Rio Rancho High School gave the Slam Team access to the school's closed-circuit television once a week and the poets thrived.  In March 2003, a teenage girl named Courtney presented one of her poems before an audience at Barnes & Noble bookstore in Albuquerque, then read the poem live on the school's closed-circuit television channel.  A school military liaison and the high school principal accused the girl of being "un-American" because she criticized the war in Iraq and the Bush administration's failure to give substance to its "No child left behind" education policy.  The girl's mother, also a teacher, was ordered by the principal to destroy the child's poetry. The mother refused and may lose her job.  Bill Nevins was suspended for not censoring the poetry of his students. Remember, there is no obscenity to be found in any of the poetry. He was later fired by the principal.  After firing Nevins and terminating the teaching and reading of poetry in the school, the principal and the military liaison read a poem of their own as they raised the flag outside the school. When the principal had the flag at full staff, he applauded the action he'd taken in concert with the military liaison.

       I have to admit, even I accepted as "fact" that NPR leans more "left" than other commercial media outlets. Yet this recent  urlLink F.A.I.R. study  of NPR's guest list shows something quite different.  FAIR’s study recorded every on-air source quoted in June 2003 on four National Public Radio news shows: All Things Considered, Morning Edition, Weekend Edition Saturday and Week-end Edition Sunday. Each source was classified by occupation, gender, nationality and partisan affiliation. Altogether, the study counted 2,334 quoted sources, featured in 804 stories.  In addition to studying NPR’s general news sources, FAIR looked at the think tanks NPR relies on most frequently, and at its list of regular commentators. To ensure a substantial sample of these subsets, we looked at four months (5–8/03) of think tank sources and commentators on the same four shows...  That NPR harbors a liberal bias is an article of faith among many conservatives. Spanning from the early ’70s, when President Richard Nixon demanded that “all funds for public broadcasting be cut” (9/23/71), through House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s similar threats in the mid-’90s, the notion that NPR leans left still endures.  Despite the commonness of such claims, little evidence has ever been presented for a left bias at NPR, and FAIR’s latest study gives it no support. Looking at partisan sources—including government officials, party officials, campaign workers and consultants—Republicans outnumbered Democrats by more than 3 to 2 (61 percent to 38 percent). A majority of Republican sources when the GOP controls the White House and Congress may not be surprising, but Republicans held a similar though slightly smaller edge (57 percent to 42 percent) in 1993, when Clinton was president and Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. And a lively race for the Democratic presidential nomination was beginning to heat up at the time of the 2003 study.  Republicans not only had a substantial partisan edge, individual Republicans were NPR’s most popular sources overall, taking the top seven spots in frequency of appearance. George Bush led all sources for the month with 36 appearances, followed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld (8) and Sen. Pat Roberts (6). Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, Secretary of State Colin Powell, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer and Iraq proconsul Paul Bremer all tied with five appearances each.  And then there are all of the think tank sources that the network uses:  FAIR’s four-month study of NPR in 1993 found 10 think tanks that were cited twice or more. In a new four-month study (5/03–8/03), the list of think tanks cited two or more times has grown to 17, accounting for 133 appearances.  FAIR classified each think tank by ideological orientation as either centrist, right of center or left of center. Representatives of think tanks to the right of center outnumbered those to the left of center by more than four to one: 62 appearances to 15. Centrist think tanks provided sources for 56 appearances.  It's interesting, after reading this study, that many of us still considering NPR a "left-leaning" organization. Apparently, with the hard shift to the right this country has seemingly taken, even an organization which airs right-wing voices considerably more than left-wing voices seems "liberal" just by airing what is probably a higher percentage of liberal viewpoints compared with what we get from mainstream commercial media outlets. This makes the poorly publicized, launched and staffed Air America even more important in today's political climate. Too bad it seems doomed to spectacular failure. It's the Chevy Chase talk show equivalent of talk radio.

       The  NY Times  Public Editor is the readers' representative. His opinions and conclusions are his own. Here he  urlLink discusses  the  Times ' serious shortcomings in their coverage of the march to war in Iraq. It raises some questions that many of us were asking of ALL the media since the Bush Administration's propaganda campaign to wage war in Iraq began.  Not only should the paper go back and reinvestigate many of the stories to  set the record straight, they should examine closely how these stories were misreported in the first place. Obviously systemic issues, particularly among the editors at the paper, were primarily to blame but what about reporters who blithely incorporated what amounts to disinformation into their stories from "sources" that turned out to be unreliable or ones that flat out lied to foward the war agenda? Judith Miller certainly comes to mind as a "reporter" who was essentially a "mouthpiece" for the administration's case that Iraq was a dangerous country filled to the brim with WMD. She should have been fired months ago, as should several editors. If no one is to be held accountable for the shoddy work done before and during the war, how can we believe anything will ever change? Accountability without consequences isn't acceptable in the Pentagon and it's not acceptable at one of the country's leading media outlets. Let some heads roll.

       I know alot of Dems who find McCain an appealing choice for VP but he is absolutely NOT the right man for the job. Don't get me wrong, I like McCain's integrity and straight talk but his positions on many issues are in direct contrast to a Democratic agenda.  urlLink Keep saying no John.   McCain opposes gun control of any kind, he even failed to support the Brady Bill. He opposes legal abortion, he supports school vouchers, he favors school prayer. The League of Conservation voters gave McCain a 6% ranking in the 99-00 session and he's never been over a 53% ranking, so don't look to him to lead the fight against global warming. He's voted with the Christian Coalition 83% of the time. He's not a strong supporter of civil liberties or civil rights. This is a man we want a heartbeat away from the Preidency? I think not.

Interestingly, Disney is choosing to  urlLink market  this movie much in the same way "The Passion of the Christ" was marketed. One can only hope that it's half as successful!

       What's all this hoopla over a dead President? Reagan wasn't that impressive and frankly, he was an impostor and not that sharp. Corruption was rife in his administration. There were secret arms deals for hostages, illegal arming of rebels in Central America in defiance of Congress, there was massive deficit spending and the largest peacetime increase in military spending in history. There was non-response when our soldiers were blown up in Lebanon and a ridiculous war fighting a few hundred Cubans in Grenada. Let's not forget Reagan's "trickle down" economics, what a complete load of bullshit and a total failure that was. The rich got richer and the poor got poorer. The gaps between rich and poor grew and the middle class was squeezed mercilessly. Gee, that kind of sounds familiar, doesn't it?  Yet now, in death, after having mentally checked out over a decade ago, the man is being lauded like he was one of the best leaders of all-time. Frankly, that's an insult to the likes of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. Now they are talking about replacing Hamilton on the $10 bill with Ronnie? Get serious! It's bad enough there is an airport named after him. And what's with all of these Democrats waxing poetic about how wonderful a leader Reagan was? They are acting exactly like they did when the Bush Administration lied about the reasons for war in Iraq, laying down and becoming "yes men", afraid of any public backlash against a perceived popular decision. The only reason it was popular is that there were no dissenting voices pointing out all of the faults in the Administration's arguments for war and there are no voices out there pointing out many of the terrible legacies of Reagan's presidency.  I despised Reagan then and I feel no differently 16 years later. He's gone, that's the cycle of life. Let's move on. I sense the media is all over this crap, romanticizing his tenure as president, because it allows them to talk about something about other than the quagmire in Iraq, the prison abuse scandal and Ashcroft teetering on the edge of contempt of Congress. Let's get back to the real world and all of the challenges facing us.

       Instead of all the hot air Republicans are collectively emitting paying their respects to Reagan, a President who oversaw our country's transformation from the world's largest creditor to the world's largest debtor in just 8 short years, they should be looking to honor his legacy by scrapping the corporate tax legislation currently winding its way through Congress. Legislation we can all be sure will allow more companies to avoid taxes while adding to our already humungous federal deficit.  An actual achievement of Reagan's was the 1986 Tax Reform Act, a bill whose purpose was to make the tax code simpler and fairer while increasing economic performance, three things the current legislation will NOT achieve in any way.

       It's become obvious, thanks to the discovery of  urlLink audio tapes  of Enron traders joking about creating the power crisis in California, even to those trying to ignore the fact that California's energy market was manipulated and hundreds of millions of dollars were stolen from Californians via their electricity bills. Now it is imperative that an even more methodical investigation take place about who knew what and how high it went. These new audio tapes seem to implicate Ken Lay and his top people. It's not like we all didn't know he was in on the plan, it's just that he seemed to have "plausible deniability" and there was nothing to link him to the criminal activity. It appears things have taken a new twist.  And while investigators are at it, they really should take a close look at Enron and Ken Lay's connection to the White House, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force that he's been fighting so hard to keep secret these past few years.  Perhaps the major news outlets could partially redeem themselves after their dereliction of duty when it came to casting a critical eye on the Bush Administration's faulty, manufactured case for war in Iraq. There i still a story to tell here. The question is, is there a news organization out there with the balls to do it, in an election year no less?

        Beliefnet  has an  urlLink interview  with the venerable buddhist monk and longtime activist for peace and human rights,  urlLink  Thich Nhat Hanh  . It is important not to blame and single out the U.S. in this kind of situation because any country would do the same thing under the same conditions. During the Vietnam War atrocities were committed by both sides.  The statement President Bush made that the U.S. just sent dedicated, devoted young men, not abusers to Iraq shocked me. Because committing acts of torture is just the result of the training that the soldiers have already undergone. The training already makes them lose all their humanity. The young men going to Iraq were already full of fear, wanting to protect themselves at all cost, being ready to kill at any moment.  In this state you can become extremely cruel. You may pour all of your hate and anger on prisoners of war by torturing and abusing them. The purpose of your violence is not only to extract information from them, but also to express your hate and fear. The prisoners of war are the victims, but the abusers, the torturers are also the victims. Their actions will continue to disturb them long after the abuse has ended.  Preparing for war and fighting a war means allowing our human nature to die and the animal nature in us to take over. We should never be tempted to resort to violence and war to solve conflict. Violence always leads to more violence.

       It was hard enough to go to any of the seemingly hundreds of fast food restaurants that loom within a 5 square mile of my abode after having read Eric Schlosser's   Fast Food Nation   last year and having recently seen Morgan Spurlock's ode to the gastric delights and ruinous health effects of fast food,   Super Size Me  . If anyone needed that last little push over the edge,  remembering the Swedish discovery of the cancer-causing chemical "acrylamide", created in high-carbohydrate foods when they are cooked at high temperatures, back in 2002 should have done it.  Now some intrepid individuals in California are  urlLink suing   McDonald's  and  Burger King  to force them to start labeling their french fries with a cancer warning label due to high levels of acrylamide found in them after cooking. They are pursuing this lawsuit due to a piece of voter-approved state legislation, Proposition 65... uses labels to "help consumers make informed choices about products," which let the buyer beware of chemicals in food and consumer products that are "known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm." Unfortunately for consumers, there is no practical enforcement of the rule.  Alan Hirsch, a spokesman for California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), explains. "Acrylamide has actually been listed on prop 65 since 1990, for the hazard associated with occupational uses of the chemical, but its presence in food has only been known for about two years. Labeling of chemicals on the list, although required, is not enforced. "  That's precisely why McDonald's and Burger King are being sued. "Though it's the responsibility of individual businesses to have a warning for products on the list," Hirsch says, "Prop 65 allows any member of the public to enforce a warning if there isn't one in place." If the world's largest fry sellers lose, as many suspect they will, they'll be under court order to place acrylamide warnings in their California restaurants, if not directly on their packaging. Because fast food restaurants do about 60% of their business in the drive-through window, packaging labels may be preferred. With so many health organizations and scientists acknowledging the danger of acrylamide, every restaurant selling french fries should post some sort of warning sign or label in the restaurant, on the menu, or on the packaging itself, to inform consumers of the possible deleterious health effects of the french fries. It should also refer to any other foods which pose the same health risks. I can't make the best food choices for me, as a consumer, unless I am well informed about the impact of those choices on my health.

Here's the money paragraph from an ESPN article: It looks like Buss, the Lakers' owner, has made his choice: Kobe stays; the others can go. In other words, he is not averse to trading Shaq and is willing to build his franchise around a narcissist who's on trial for rape, doesn't make his teammates better and is in denial over all of it.  Now if the Boston Celtics could only figure out a way to get Shaq (partial ownership?), we'd be a team to contend with next year. ANY team with Shaq is a team to contend with. Buss is a flat out idiot for letting Shaq walk and spending all his money and effort on re-signing Kobe.

       Bush and Cheney continue to assert that there was an Iraq - al Qaeda connection in opposition to all of the facts, or more accurately, the  lack  of facts to support that conclusion.

It is an outrage that Bush and Cheney are allowed to get away with this behaviour and not be eviscerated in the press and on TV for their blatant attempts at lying to the American public.

       It's the only conclusion one can come away with after reading  urlLink this interview  she conducted with an anonymous 22 year career CIA officer who actually headed up the CIA's only "station" dedicated towards one person - as opposed to a country - Osama bin laden.  I think the most relevant and compelling assertion this CIA officer makes is that it's not our freedoms or liberties that bin Laden opposes and is fighting against, it our foreign policies which he views as anti-Muslim - we are occupying two of the holiest nations in Islam - Saudi Arabia and Iraq and our unwavering support for Israel which "occupies" Jerusalem and severely represses the Palestinian people.  "And the genius that lies behind it, because he's not a man who rants against our freedoms, our liberties, our voting, our — the fact that our women go to school. He's not the Ayatollah Khomeini; he really doesn't care about all those things. To think that he's trying to rob us of our liberties and freedom is, I think, a gross mistake. What he has done, his genius, is identify particular American foreign policies that are offensive to Muslims whether they support these martial actions or not — our support for Israel, our presence on the Arabian Peninsula, our activities in Afghanistan and Iraq, our support for governments that Muslims believe oppress Muslims, be it India, China, Russia, Uzbekistan. Bin Laden has focused the Muslim world on specific, tangible, visual American policies.  Where I differ from the CIA officer's views are in the type of solution to this Islamic terrorist problem. "Anonymous" is an advocate of even more heavy-handed military action against all terrorist elements and the nation states that provide them cover and support. At no point does he address the "foreign policy question" and suggest that we adjust our foreign policy initiatives and goals so that some of the grievances many Muslims have might be addressed and alleviated.  Do we need to maintain a troop presence in Saudi Arabia? Do they not purchase from us on a regular basis the most cutting-edge military technology known to man? As has been discussed ad nauseum for the last 18 months or so, did we really need to invade Iraq to make ourselves safer? Finally, is our fanatical military and economic support of the government of Israel and our blatant favoritism on their behalf when it comes to the Middle East Peace Process entirely necessary? Why can't we approach that conflict with more of an even-hand and help forge a viable two-state solution?  I'm all for committing more assets to the fight against terrorists, as long as they are not squandered on wars barely connected to the issues at hand, but I also think we can implement a bilateral approach to diffusing the rising tide of Muslim hatred towards our country's policies by giving those policies a second look and modifying some of them to reflect world concerns.

       You can't really be taken seriously or considered an adult in Hollywood until you have overcome some horrible addiction, affliction or disease. Mary-Kate Olsen has checked into the hospital for a  urlLink "health-related"  issue rumored to be anorexia. Let me first say I hope she enjoys a full recovery and stays healthy, let me also say that being a twin, I think this problem can somehow be applied to both girls and therefore, both Mary-Kate AND Ashley can be taken more seriously moving forward. I guess the next step, if they care to follow in child star Drew Barrymore's footsteps now that they have a medical problem under their belts, is to bare all in a revealing Playboy spread... It's only a matter of time before they are in Charlie's Angels VI - Double Trouble as the new uber-villians.

       The "Niger/Iraq Uranium Connection" is rearing its ugly head again. It's blogged about quite interestingly by Gregory Djerejian  urlLink here .  After having been dismissed as a red-herring based on forged documents, now there seems to be deeper proof that some sort of communication took place in the late 90's/early 2000 about yellowcake. yet if this intelligence existed why did the administration never present a more convincing case to the American public?  When our government makes accusations or submits "evidence" to support a course of action they are going to take, they ought to be fuly prepared to justify and prove the veracity of the information if they expect the public to buy it. It is not up to us to blithely accpet whatever the administration says, it us up to them to provide as much incontrovertible proof that what they are claiming is true. We are all owed as much so that we can make up out own minds in an educated fashion.  The Financial Times has an article that's resurrected this whole issue. Read it  urlLink here .

       According to the intrepid reporting of my close personal friend,  Benjamin Sand , who toils away in his tiny cubicle as a  Voice of America  "reporter" in Hong Kong, the largest Muslim separatist group in the Phillipines is the  M oro  I slamic  L iberation  F ront, or  urlLink MILF .   MILF ? I know several MILF's. My ex-girlfriend Katy in Tampa is a MILF. My friend Sherie in Washington State is a MILF. My friend Jessyca in Canada is a MILF. Here is the  urlLink MILF  website, though I don't see much about Islamic separatism on its homepage. Perhaps these Filipino muslims should consider a name change?  In addition, the US embassy seems to have an opinion and concerns about the MILFs as well.   But the United States questioned the pace of those negotiations and the MILF's sincerity.  "The ambassador expressed some concern that the current leadership of the MILF was not taking advantage of the opportunity to really move forward to peacefully push the causes they represent," said embassy spokeswoman Karen Kelley.   Now when  I  visit the MILF website (purely for research purposes I can assure you), it looks like every opportunity is being taken advantage of, they  are  moving forward and there looks to be a lot of peaceful "pushing" going on for the "cause" they represent.

       EJ Dionne, in  urlLink  The Post  , reminds us of a great quote from Sen. Orrin Hatch, which was directed at Bush in a presidential debate in December '99:  "You've been a great governor," Hatch declared of his rival for the Republican presidential nomination. "My only problem with you, governor, is that you've only had four and going into your fifth year of governorship. . . . Frankly, I really believe that you need more experience before you become president of the United States. That's why I'm thinking of you as a vice presidential candidate."  So let us not forget this as the "Republican Guard" gear up to take shots at VP candidate, John Edwards, by claiming he lacks experience. Jesus, the Governor of Texas, which Bush was for a little over 4 years, is about as close to a ceremonial position as you can get, as far as governorships go in this country. Of course, the more cynical, granola-eating, freak-flag flying, flag burning, civil rights loving, peacenik lefties out there probably feel his position as president has been largely ceremonial as well, with policy decisions actually dictated by "Tricky" Dick Cheney and his "Fun Bunch" of neocon minions. I don't often agree with cynics but...

       The gov't  almost  shot down a plane over Washington, DC that was carrying the governor of KY. All because the plane had a broken transponder and couldn't be identified by Homeland Security (though the FAA could but never passed along this vital tidbit of information). They even evacuated the Capitol as a precaution. While this close call, in and of itself, is highly disturbing, what  urlLink this article  in  The Post  also unveils is that despite the heightened air security around DC, it won't stop a  determined FIRST attacker  in an airplane. It's really only effective at stopping a SECOND wave. How many planes would have to hit the White House to destroy it? Ummm, I'm thinking ONE! No second wave needed. The President can't even make  himself  safer, let alone the rest of the country.   For security officials, a key factor is how little time they had to identify Fletcher's aircraft and make critical decisions. One senior federal security official who has studied the incident said the chances of shooting down the plane would have been "50-50" given the time sequence.  The official said  the current system is prepared to stop a second assault, as was the case Sept. 11, not a first attack . Expanding the restricted flight zone -- or a more radical move, such as closing National Airport -- would be required to provide a greater level of security, he said.

       Interesting  Mother Jones   urlLink interview  with Richard Ben Cramer, author of  How Israel Lost . If I had to sum up what I knew about this place 20 years ago, I would have called it a nice little socialist country with one problem. Its problem, of course, being its relations with the Arabs inside the country and in the neighboring states. But now that one problem has eaten up the rest of the society. The conflict has become the reason for being for Israel. And it's not such a little place anymore, with the policies of annexation and settlement. It's not a socialist country at all anymore. When Israel cast itself as America's little buddy during the Reagan years, it changed over to a very hard-edged capitalistic economy. And it's not such a nice little country anymore. I'm not just talking about the not-nice effect of a suicide bomb on a bus or the equally not-nice effect of a missile fired from a gunship into a Palestinian neighborhood. I'm talking about the society at large. You can't ask two generations of your men to go into the territories and act as the brutal kings of everything they survey and then expect them to come home and live in lamb-like gentleness. In every sphere of society there are things that started in the territories. Now they've drifted back into the society: the repression of other opinions, the tendency to brutality, the resort to force. All of these have come back to harm Israeli society. And there's the hopelessness, which may be the worst effect still.

        In a front-page article  December 26, 2002 , The Washington Post revealed that prisoners at a CIA interrogation center at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan were being subjected to abuses that veered on torture:  "The picture that emerges is of a brass-knuckled quest for information . . . in which the traditional lines between right and wrong, legal and inhumane, are evolving and blurred."  The media largely ignored the story, with the notable exceptions of  The Economist  and the indispensable Seymour Hersh of  The New Yorker .  What was happening at Bagram Air Base soon disappeared from the news, but the revelations of our repellent abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib interrogation cells, where Saddam Hussein's torturers had previously operated, raised widespread questions about American adherence to the Geneva Conventions and other international human rights standards. The first whistle-blower was a soldier, specialist Joseph Darby: "I didn't want to see any more prisoners being abused, because I knew it was wrong."  However, in the rush of reports, the CIA and its then leader, George Tenet, were hardly mentioned. But a startling probe on ABC's Nightline on May 13, 2004, "The Disappeared," focused on super-secret CIA interrogation operations overseas, about which ABC News' Chris Bury said:  "We don't know where they are being held. We don't know how many of them there are. We don't know what the rules are."  This prison system is "so secret that its very existence is classified. The inmates are believed to make up a who's who of the top Al Qaeda leadership. But even their names are classified. Some of them may never be released. For all practical purposes, they have just disappeared." They are called "high-value" detainees.  As Chris Bury continued, these prisons, set up after 9-11, "may be unprecedented in American history.  They operate entirely outside the U.S. judicial system, according to a set of rules approved by the Justice Department [that] are also top secret."  (Emphasis added)  Chilling.  urlLink Read the whole article .

         What's more American than asking questions?    By Michael Moore   For too long now we have abandoned our flag to those who see it as a symbol of war and dominance, as a way to crush dissent at home. Flags are flying from the back of SUVs, rising high above car dealerships, plastering the windows of businesses and adorning paper bags from fast-food restaurants. But these flags are intended to send a message: "You're either with us or you're against us," "Bring it on!" or "Watch what you say, watch what you do."  Those who absconded with our flag now use it as a weapon against those who question America's course. They remind me of that famous 1976 photo of an anti-busing demonstrator in Boston thrusting a large American flag on a pole into the stomach of the first black man he encountered. These so-called patriots hold the flag tightly in their grip and, in a threatening pose, demand that no one ask questions. Those who speak out find themselves shunned at work, harassed at school, booed off Oscar stages. The flag has become a muzzle, a piece of cloth stuffed into the mouths of those who dare to ask questions. ...  I think it's time for those of us who love this country -- and everything it should stand for -- to reclaim our flag from those who would use it to crush rights and freedoms, both here at home and overseas. We need to redefine what it means to be a proud American.  … If these things represent what it means to be an American these days -- and I am an American -- should I hang my head in shame? No. Instead, I intend to perform what I believe is my patriotic duty. I can't think of a more American thing to do than raise questions -- and demand truthful answers -- when our leader wants to send our sons and daughters off to die in a war.  If we don't do that -- the bare minimum -- for those who offer to defend our country, then we have failed them and ourselves. They offer to die for us, if necessary, so that we can be free. All they ask in return is that we never send them into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. And with this war, we have broken faith with our troops by sending them off to be killed and maimed for wrong and immoral reasons.  Let's create a world in which, when people see the Stars and Stripes, they will think of us as the people who brought peace to the world, who brought good-paying jobs to all citizens and clean water for the world to drink.  In anticipation of that day, I am putting my flag out today, with hope and with pride.

       I am not certain of the original source for this article. I could not find any  definitive  original version of it online. I believe the attribution is correct. I think that what Prof. Harari says is very important which is why I am re-printing the transcript of his talk here.    A View from the Eye of the Storm  talk delivered by Haim Harari at a   meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national   corporation, April, 2004.   Professor HAIM HARARI, a theoretical physicist, is the Chair, Davidson Institute of Science Education, and Former President, from 1988 to 2001, of the Weizmann Institute of Science.  During his years as President of the Institute, it entered numerous new scientific fields and projects, built 47 new buildings, raised one Billion Dollars in philanthropic money, hired more than half of its current tenured Professors and became one of the highest royalty-earning academic organizations in the world.  Throughout all his adult life, he has made major contributions to three different fields: Particle Physics Research on the international scene, Science Education in the Israeli school system and Science Administration and Policy Making.   As you know, I usually provide the scientific and technological "entertainment" in our meetings, but, on this occasion, our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come. I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information. My perspective is entirely based on what I see, on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years. You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver, which you are supposed to question, when you visit a country.  I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli-Arab conflict. However, I will touch upon it only in passing. I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events. I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco, which is predominantly Arab, predominantly Moslem, but includes many non-Arab and also significant non-Moslem minorities.  Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood? Because Israel and any problems related to it, in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media, is not the central issue, and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region. Yes, there is a 100 year-old Israeli-Arab conflict, but it is not where the main show is. The millions who died in the Iran-Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel. The mass murder happening right now in Sudan, where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens, has nothing to do with Israel. The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilian in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel. Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait, endangered Saudi Arabia and butchered his own people because of Israel. Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60's because of Israel. Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel. The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel. The Libyan blowing up of the Pan-Am flight had nothing to do with Israel, and I could go on and on and on.  The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional, by any standard of the word, and would have been so even if Israel would have joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine would have existed for 100 years. The 22 member countries of the Arab league, from Mauritania to the Gulf States, have a total population of 300 millions, larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion. They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe. These 22 countries, with all their oil and natural resources, have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone. Within this meager GDP, the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business, but by being corrupt rulers. The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago. Human rights are below any reasonable standard, in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission. According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N., the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates. The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis. Birth rates in the region are very high, increasing the poverty, the social gaps and the cultural decline. And all of this is happening in a region, which only 30 years ago, was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world, and in a Moslem area, which developed, at some point in history, one of the most advanced cultures in the world.  It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators, terror networks, fanaticism, incitement, suicide murders and general decline. It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States, on Israel, on Western Civilization, on Judaism and Christianity, on anyone and anything, except themselves.  Do I say all of this with the satisfaction of someone discussing the failings of his enemies? On the contrary, I firmly believe that the world would have been a much better place and my own neighborhood would have been much more pleasant and peaceful, if things were different.  I should also say a word about the millions of decent, honest, good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families. They are double victims of an outside world, which now develops Islamophobia and of their own environment, which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional. The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and of the incitement but they also do not stand up against it. They become accomplices, by omission, and this applies to political leaders, intellectuals, business people and many others. Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong, but are afraid to express their views.  The events of the last few years have amplified four issues, which have always existed, but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region. These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict, or perhaps we should already refer to it as "the undeclared World War III". I have no better name for the present situation. A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War, but we are already well into it.  The first element is the suicide murder. Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular, if I may use this expression, only lately. Even after September 11, it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon. It is a very potent psychological weapon. Its real direct impact is relatively minor. The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents. September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes. More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya-based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started. Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq.  So what is all the fuss about suicide killings? It creates headlines. It is spectacular. It is frightening. It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded. It is always shown on television in great detail. One such murder, with the help of hysterical media coverage, can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while, as it did in Bali and in Turkey.  But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer. This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World. The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder, not the next one. We may arrange for the best airport security in the world.. But if you want to murder by suicide, you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people. Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector? How about the lines to the check-in counters in a busy travel period? Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses. Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters, concert halls, supermarkets, shopping malls, schools and hospitals. Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target, not to speak of killing the guards themselves. You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way. And it is a war!  What is behind the suicide murders? Money, power and cold-blooded murderous incitement, nothing else. It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs. No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up. No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself. No relative of anyone influential has done it. Wouldn't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves, or to talk  their sons into doing it, if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor? Aren't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven? Instead, they send outcast women, naïve children, retarded people and young incited hotheads. They promise them the delights, mostly sexual, of the next world, and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead.  Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair. The poorest region in the world, by far, is Africa. It never happens there. There are numerous desperate people in the world, in different cultures, countries and continents. Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives, reconnaissance and transportation. There was certainly more despair in Saddam's Iraq then in Paul Bremmer's Iraq, and no one exploded himself. A suicide murder is simply a horrible, vicious weapon of cruel, inhuman, cynical, well-funded terrorists, with no regard to human life, including the life of their fellow countrymen, but with very high regard to their own affluent well-being and their hunger for power.  The only way to fight this new "popular" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas: the offensive way. Like in the case of organized crime, it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid. You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer in the street corner. You must go after the head of the "Family".  If part of the public supports it, others tolerate it, many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood, organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism. The United States understands this now, after September 11. Russia is beginning to understand it. Turkey understands it well. I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it. Unfortunately, it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders will arrive in Europe in a big way. In my humble opinion, this will definitely happen. The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning. The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable. Until Europe wakes up, this unity will not be achieved.  The second ingredient is words, more precisely lies. Words can be lethal. They kill people. It is often said that politicians, diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie, as part of their professional life. But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish, in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications, which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about. An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened, or was an American provocation or, even better, a Jewish plot.  You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information, Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad. Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic. But to stand, day after day, and to make such preposterous statements, known to everybody to be lies, without even being ridiculed in your own milieu, can only happen in this region. Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester, but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time. It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence, every day, even now, to similar liars. After all, if you want to be an antisemite, there are subtle ways of doing it. You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed. But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case. When these same leaders make other statements, the Western media report them as if they could be true.  It is a daily occurrence that the same people, who finance, arm and dispatch suicide murderers, condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras, talking to a world audience, which even partly believes them. It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world. Incitement by Arab TV, accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies, has become a powerful weapon of those who lie, distort and want to destroy everything. Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so-called martyrs, and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows. I recommend to you, even though most of you do not understand Arabic, to watch Al Jazeera, from time to time. You will not believe your own eyes.  But words also work in other ways, more subtle. A demonstration in Berlin, carrying banners supporting Saddam's regime and featuring three-year old babies dressed as suicide murderers, is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "peace demonstration". You may support or oppose the Iraq war, but to refer to fans of Saddam, Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much. A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day, eats, observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill. She then blows herself up, killing 20 people, including many children, with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant. She is called "martyr" by several Arab leaders and "activist" by the European press. Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows.  There is a new game in town: The actual murderer is called "the military wing", the one who pays him, equips him and sends him is now called "the political wing" and the head of the operation is called the "spiritual leader". There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature, used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media. These words are much more dangerous than many people realize. They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities. It was Joseph Goebels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it. He is now being outperformed by his successors.  The third aspect is money. Huge amounts of money, which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world, are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder. In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves. The money funds their travel, explosives, hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets. They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters, planners, commanders, preachers, all of whom make a living, usually a very comfortable living, by serving as terror infrastructure. Finally, we find the third circle of so-called religious, educational and welfare organizations, which actually do some good, feed the hungry and provide some schooling, but brainwash a new generation with hatred, lies and ignorance. This circle operates mostly through mosques, madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media. It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior, that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal. It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world, for the miseries of the region.  Figuratively speaking, this outer circle is the guardian, which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement, rather than to the world outside. Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from, or blackmail by, the inner circles. The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate. Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20, the most receptive age to incitement, guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred.  Of the three circles described above, the inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria, until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes. These states, as well as the Palestinian Authority, are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors. The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia, but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and, to a smaller extent, by donations  of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations, whose goals may be noble, but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle. The Saudi regime, of course, will be the next victim of major terror, when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle. The Saudis are beginning to understand it, but they fight the inner circles, while still financing the  infrastructure at the outer circle.  Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot. You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe, not in the training camps of suicide murderers. The Jihad "soldiers" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots, while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland. Mrs. Arafat, who lives in Paris with her daughter, receives tens of thousands Dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority while a typical local ringleader of the Al-Aksa brigade, reporting to Arafat, receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars, for performing murders at the retail level.  The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws. The civilized world believes in democracy, the rule of law, including international law, human rights, free speech and free press, among other liberties. There are naïve old-fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols, not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war, avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs. Never in history, not even in the Nazi period, was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now. Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy. Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations. Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him? Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers? Does free speech protects you when you shout "fire" in a crowded theater? Should there be death penalty, for deliberate multiple murders? These are the old-fashioned dilemmas. But now we have an entire new set.  Do you raid a mosque, which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage? Do you return fire, if you are attacked from a hospital? Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages? Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets? Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly? Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you, standing deliberately behind a group of children? Do you raid terrorist headquarters, hidden in a mental hospital? Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another, always surrounded by children? All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas. What do you do? Well, you do not want to face the dilemma. But it cannot be avoided.  Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that someone would openly stay in a well-known address in Teheran, hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it, executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France, killing hundreds of innocent people, accepting responsibility for the crimes, promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same, while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him, invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary. I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done, in such a situation.  The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment. It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice-skater into the rink or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player. In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister, because such an act is unthinkable, international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals, mosques and ambulances, while being protected by their Government or society. International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones, stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government. International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country, which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him. The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law and define all those who attack them as war criminals, with some Western media repeating the allegations. The good news is that all of this is temporary, because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality. The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder, not during and not after. After every world war, the rules of international law have changed and the same will happen after the present one. But during the twilight zone, a lot of harm can be done.  The picture I described here is not pretty. What can we do about it? In the short run, only fight and win. In the long run ? only educate the next generation and open it to the world. The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force. The outer circle cannot be eliminated by force. Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite, more power to women, more education, counter propaganda, boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media, internet and the international scene. Above all, we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil.  Allow me, for a moment, to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science. When you have a malignant tumor, you may remove the tumor itself surgically. You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body, thereby preventing new "supplies" from expanding the tumor. If you want to be sure, it is best to do both.  But before you fight and win, by force or otherwise, you have to realize that you are in a war, and this may take Europe a few more years. In order to win, it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes, so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people. I do not want to comment here on whether  the American-led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument, but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia. Now that Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya are out, two and a half terrorist states remain: Iran, Syria and Lebanon, the latter being a Syrian colony. Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list. As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq, both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them. Iran is encircled by Afghanistan, by the Gulf States, Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union. Syria is surrounded by Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Israel. This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries. It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq. I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria, but that is the resulting situation.  In my humble opinion, the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime. It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions. It has an ideology, which claims supremacy over Western culture. It is ruthless. It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces, using Iranian Embassies.. It is clearly trying to develop Nuclear Weapons. Its so-called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "good-cop versus bad-cop" game. Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism, it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq, it is fully funding the Hizbulla and, through it, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekhistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium, which includes, as minor players, Syria, Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq. Nevertheless, most European countries still trade with Iran, try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals.  In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate. It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaida and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hizbulla, Sadr and other Iranian inspired enterprises. When it serves their business needs, all of them collaborate beautifully.  It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle, which is the fertile breeding ground of terror. It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations, to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism. It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety, financial interests or ignorance.  Above all, never surrender to terror. No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result, if not for the train bombings a few days earlier. But it really does not matter. What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq. The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries, including France, who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq. In the long run, Spain itself will pay even more.  Is the solution a democratic Arab world? If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press, free speech, a functioning judicial system, civil liberties, equality to women, free international travel, exposure to international media and ideas, laws against racial incitement and against defamation, and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals, places of worship and children, then yes, democracy is the solution. If democracy is just free elections, it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected, the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory. We have seen it already in Algeria and, to a certain extent, in Turkey. It will happen again, if the ground is not prepared very carefully. On the other hand, a certain transition democracy, as in Jordan, may be a better temporary solution, paving the way for the real thing, perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China.  I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail. But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war, the more costly and painful the victory will be. Europe, more than any other region, is the key. Its understandable recoil from wars, following the horrors of World War II, may cost thousands of additional innocent lives, before the tide will turn.   Food for thought.

       All of the nuclear weapons research facilities have been closed down due to potentially substantial  urlLink leaks of classified materials  related to bomb-making.    Under Abraham's order, sites cannot resume normal operations until they review security procedures, conduct inventories of all classified data stored on removable devices and can certify that the data is stored under proper security. Workers will be held accountable for any future problems, he warned.  Outside experts said Abraham's unprecedented order would curtail operations across the Energy Department's chain of laboratories, computing centers, accelerators and factories that employ more than 100,000 workers.  Abraham's order was based on growing concern that the Energy Department had a systemwide vulnerability to losing important bomb secrets stored on removable devices, known as Classified Removable Electronic Media, or CREM. Such devices allow a person to download massive quantities of data that can be easily concealed.    Anyone lax in the security and protection of nuclear secrets should be, at the very least, fired immediately and at the most, tried for treason. Just because the Cold War is over doesn't mean the threats against this country aren't many and severe. Certainly with the global emergence of terrorism directed against the West, the protection of our nuclear weapons research is just as important, if not more so, than during the Cold War. During the Cold War, the US government could take a modicum of solace in the fact that M.A.D. (mutually assured destruction) was not something the Soviet Union or the U.S. were anxious to initiate. The enemy was clear and they were located in a specific place. Therefore it presented a clear and fixed target to retaliate against. They had the bomb, we had the bomb, thus "nuclear stalemate".  Terrorism, in contrast, is amorphous. It exists, at least in theory if not in practice, all around us. Those who are part of the global terrorism collective would seem not to have any qualms about using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against this nation or any others in the West or Middle East that it viewed as a threat to its vision of a worldwide Islamic theocracy based on the most fundamental interpretation of the Koran. They just need to get their hands on the weapons themselves or the means to make their own. We end up continuing to be our own worst enemy, potentially sowing the seeds of our own destruction, by letting nuclear secrets leak out of our most top-secret facilities.  What I think remains to be be seen is if this is a threat from within or from without. In other words, are we being whipped up into a bigger cauldron of fear so that more of our rights can be taken away, creating more of a closed, militaristic society, or are the devils really at the doorstep with suitcase nukes?  Stay tuned.

       The story linked to  urlLink here  is a gripping account of the author's recent experience on a flight from Detroit to Los Angeles. It is a story of 14 Middle Eastern men on a plane, suspicious behaviour, fear, panic and eventually... nothing. Yet the story is not anti-climactic, though it raises more questions than it answers. Furthermore, it's not only a great example of the times we now live in, where the mere sight of a group of Middle Eastern-looking individuals can strike fear into the heart of Americans, but an open question as to how law enforcement can make all citizens safer in the post-9/11 "climate of fear" we are in without trampling individuals' civil rights.  Speaking for myself, if I had observed all that was going on in the plane's cabin that day, I would have been extremely nervous and on-edge. One thing that might have been more constructive in that situation though was, rather than cower in my highly uncomfortable, vastly over-priced seat, I might have just approached some of the men and spoken with them about their travels to get a better sense of who they are and what they were all about. A big part of fear comes from ignorance and the only way I can see of dissipating some of that fear would be to talk to the individuals acting suspiciously in order to ascertain what their intent might be, if any. Not that I expect a person to come out and reveal they are a terrorist, precisely I expect the opposite. That once I talked with these individuals the fear would be gone and I would not have jumped to any unnecessary conclusions.

       Los Alamos National Laboratory, our nation's top nuclear weapons research facility, keeps  urlLink losing classified materials . Does this strike anyone else as unbelievable? Some of the brightest people in the scientific world must work there, yet they "lose" computer discs, shoot themselves in the eye with dangerous lasers, bring classified documents home with them and send out classified information over insecure e-mail lines. Hell, I'm only functionally literate, don't even have a college degree, yet even I am not  that  stupid. I'm more careful with my credit card info than they are with nuclear secrets! And who shoots themselves in the eye with a laser? Didn't any of these people ever take shop class in high school and learn the importance of proper eye protection around machines?  You might wonder who runs Los Alamos and that would be an excellent question. The answer would be the University of California. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for California's public institution of higher learning.  We're busy excoriating Russia about the potential proliferation of their nuclear secrets via rogue scientists and their loosely guarded stockpiles of warheads, condemning Pakistan for trading nuclear secrets and yet former Los Alamos scientist and FBI whipping boy, Wen Ho Lee, kept a bulging file at home about miniature nuclear warheads!  We've all seen the action movies where the bad guys (or good guys) easily infiltrate a family home to retrieve sensitive information. Would it have really been hard for a determined foreign power or terrorist group to gain access to the Lee home for some snooping? I don't think so.  When some mini-nuke goes off in a nightclub in Los Angeles, I don't think the cavalier attitude towards security at Los Alamos, and I'm sure many other sensitive scientific research sites in this country, will be such a trivial thing. Thankfully it's being taken somewhat seriously at Los Alamos and they've shut the place down. What's really needed is some good ass-kicking and for some heads to roll. Yet with how poorly the FBI investigated and prosecuted the Wen Ho Lee case, I doubt that anyone will ever face any serious consequences.

       Thanks to Bush and Co.'s lies, al-Zarqawi is the new rising superstar in the global terrorism ranks. He's making quite a name for himself in Iraq with his beheadings and high profile car bombings but his biggest proponent is George Bush, painting him as the latest "mastermind boogey man" that is attached to Iraq and al Qaeda. Bush is using him as the poster boy for Saddam's supposed connection to al Qaeda, despite the lack of evidence to support those type of claims. Of course, it's common knowledge these days that Bush and friends don't let a little something like   urlLink evidence   get in the way of a good story.    According to several military analysts working both inside and outside of government, the Bush administration's oft-repeated claim that militant leader Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi is the direct link between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein does not ring true.  Al- Zarqawi, a Jordanian who heads a group that reportedly claimed responsibility Tuesday for killing a Bulgarian worker held captive in Iraq, appears to be one of many leaders within the decentralized, global Islamic extremist movement. The various groups often work in competition with Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network for recruits and funding.  The analysts also suggest that, contrary to other Bush administration assertions, Al-Zarqawi's religious beliefs, combat tactics and operational goals were never consistent with Hussein's, nor are they in accord with those of most Iraqis currently fighting against the ongoing US-led military occupation...  ..."The jihad money market... it's like a free market," Ware said in an interview July 1 on Australian television. "The money ebbs and flows, it follows trends, it follows personalities. Some time ago, Chechnya was hot, then Afghanistan was hot... Now Iraq is the hottest of the hot, and Al-Zarqawi is here."  Ironically, according to Ware, another factor driving Al-Zarqawi's growing popularity among Islamic extremists is the substantial attention currently being paid to him by the Bush administration, as well as Bush's decision to invade and occupy Iraq in the first place.

       Thomas Frank explains the outwardly puzzlingly 30 year shift to the Right of working class America. Some excerpts below but the  urlLink whole article  is a good read.   While leftists sit around congratulating themselves on their personal virtue, the right understands the central significance of movement-building, and they have taken to the task with admirable diligence. Cast your eyes over the vast and complex structure of conservative "movement culture," a phenomenon that has little left-wing counterpart anymore. There are foundations like the one operated by the Kochs in Wichita, channeling their millions into the political battle at the highest levels, subsidizing free-market economics departments and magazines and thinkers. Then there are the think tanks, the Institutes Hoover and American Enterprise, that send the money sluicing on into the pockets of the right-wing pundit corps, Ann Coulter, Dinesh D'Souza, and the rest, furnishing them with what they need to keep their books coming and their minds in fighting trim between media bouts. A brigade of lobbyists. A flock of magazines and newspapers. A publishing house or two. And, at the bottom, the committed grassroots organizers going door-to-door, organizing their neighbors, mortgaging their houses even, to push the gospel of the backlash.      And this movement speaks to those at society's bottom, addresses them on a daily basis. From the left they hear nothing, but from the Cons they get an explanation for it all. Even better, they get a plan for action, a scheme for world conquest with a wedge issue. And why shouldn't they get to dream their lurid dreams of politics-as-manipulation? They've had it done to them enough in reality.       Unquestionably, the Right have mastered the art of articulating their plans in such a way (lying) so as to appeal to a wide cross-section of the public. A public I might add, that seemingly is too busy, lazy or stupid to look behind the rhetoric and network news soundbytes for the very real, very negative impact on their lives the policies of the Republican party have had.   American conservatism depends for its continued dominance and even for its very existence on people never making certain mental connections about the world, connections that until recently were treated as obvious or self-evident everywhere on the planet. For example, the connection between mass culture, most of which conservatives hate, and laissez-faire capitalism, which they adore without reservation. Or between the small towns they profess to love and the market forces that are slowly grinding those small towns back into the red-state dust -- which forces they praise in the most exalted terms.      In this onrushing parade of anti-knowledge my home state has proudly taken a place at the front. It is true that Kansas is an extreme case, and that there are still working-class areas here that are yet to be converted to the Con gospel. But it is also true that things that begin in Kansas --the Civil War, Prohibition, Populism, Pizza Hut -- have a historical tendency to go national.      Maybe Kansas, instead of being a laughingstock, is actually in the vanguard. Maybe what has happened there points the way in which all our public policy debates are heading. Maybe someday soon the political choices of Americans everywhere will be whittled down to the two factions of the Republican Party. Whether the Mods still call themselves "Republicans" then or have switched to being Democrats won't really matter: both groups will be what Kansans call "fiscal conservatives," which is to say "friends of business," and the issues that motivated our parents' Democratic Party will be permanently off the table.

       File under: You learn something new every day.    The candiru  is one creature you definitely don't want to get too close to. Like many of the more than 2,000 species of catfish in the world (there are about 1,200 in South America alone), Vandellia cirrhosa possesses a set of barbels that resemble feline whiskers. But this diminutive specimen -- it is only about half an inch to three inches long -- has a rather dicey trait not shared with others in its family:  It is the world's only vertebrate that parasitizes people. It can anchor itself in a most intimate part of the human anatomy, leading one jokester to dub it Urinophilus diabolicus. In English it is candidly known as the urethra fish, because it can actually swim up the urethra of an unsuspecting bather and lodge itself firmly in place by flaring sharp spines along its gills. Not only does this make for a most excruciating ordeal, but once embedded, the cold-blooded little terror can't be removed by anything short of surgery.   Candirus primarily set up house inside larger fish, where they feast on the host's blood. They are attracted to nitrogen, which usually leads them to a gill chamber, but apparently they can't distinguish between one nitrogen-emitting orifice and another: They have been known to follow a stream of urine right to its source. Candirus are hard to spot because they are nearly transparent. So if you're swimming in an Amazon jungle, here's a tip: Don't micturate in the water, and be sure to wear tight swimwear.

       Where is the  urlLink commitment  from journalists in the national news media to reporting the truth, exposing the lies and shunning the equivocation that's rife within the newsrooms of America? Francisco Ortiz Franco should be an inspiration to all who answer journalism's call. One of the founders of a crusading weekly magazine,  Zeta , in Baja, California, he was assassinated in late June, reportedly by minions of billionaire businessman, Jorge Hank Rhon.   Zeta has relentlessly exposed the incestuous connections that link up some of Baja California’s wealthiest citizens with its most corrupt law-enforcement agencies and with the most violent of drug cartels.   Now I'm not suggesting that reporters necessarily risk their lives while reporting stories but many could be alot less concerned about a paycheck and more concerned about making a difference than is currently the case in this country. Freedom of the press doesn't mean much if journalists are reluctant to exercise its full mandate.

        urlLink Operation Summer Pulse?  More like Operation Summer Suicide.  Quietly and with minimal coverage in the U.S. press, the Navy announced that from mid-July through August it would hold exercises dubbed Operation Summer Pulse '04 in waters off the China coast near Taiwan.   This will be the first time in U.S. naval history that seven of our 12 carrier strike groups deploy in one place at the same time.  It will look like the peacetime equivalent of the Normandy landings and may well end in a disaster.  At a minimum, a single carrier strike group includes the aircraft carrier itself (usually with nine or 10 squadrons and a total of about 85 aircraft), a guided missile cruiser, two guided missile destroyers, an attack submarine and a combination ammunition, oiler and supply ship.  Normally, the United States uses only one or at the most two carrier strike groups to show the flag in a trouble spot. In a combat situation it might deploy three or four, as it did for both wars with Iraq. Seven in one place is unheard of.  Operation Summer Pulse '04 was almost surely dreamed up at the Pearl Harbor headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Command and its commander, Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, and endorsed by neocons in the Pentagon. It is doubtful that Congress was consulted. This only goes to show that our foreign policy is increasingly made by the Pentagon.   Why are we messing with China? This kind of baseless provocation is foolish. Further proof that this current Administration is out of touch, not just domestically and in the Middle East but with its foreign policy globally.  Can you  imagine  the response, let alone the level of public fear, if China had the same size armada off our shores? There is no question it would lead to a military confrontation.  We should be working  with  China to not only contain and defuse the North Korea situation but also addressing with them the critical issues of Tibet, human rights and the environment, to name just a few. Our current actions will only serve to antagonize them, further militarize their stance towards the West and negate what small progress we have made with China, diplomatically, over the last few decades.

       It seems Iraq has their own Buford Pusser - Dr. Iyad Allawi. Don't let his dishdasha fool you, that's a pistol in his pocket and he's not afraid to use it! The new PM in Iraq is accused of meteing out some  urlLink tough justice  of his own on some suspected insurgents shortly before attaining his new position.   Iyad Allawi, the new Prime Minister of Iraq, pulled a pistol and executed as many as six suspected insurgents at a Baghdad police station, just days before Washington handed control of the country to his interim government, according to two people who allege they witnessed the killings.  They say the prisoners - handcuffed and blindfolded - were lined up against a wall in a courtyard adjacent to the maximum-security cell block in which they were held at the Al-Amariyah security centre, in the city's south-western suburbs.  They say Dr Allawi told onlookers the victims had each killed as many as 50 Iraqis and they "deserved worse than death".

       Can you name one prominent or credible Muslim that is at the forefront of trying to put a decent, peaceful face on their currently much maligned Islamic religion? I mean, when the head of the American Muslim Council gets popped for being involved in a  urlLink Libyan plot  to murder the (Muslim) ruler of Saudi Arabia, shit is really getting out of hand.  Muslims need to hire a PR firm and try to turn all of this bad publicity around. I'm certainly not advocating painting all Muslims with the same brush but let's face it, they are getting worse PR than Martha Stewart, George Tenet and all the doping Olympic athletes  combined .   Holy Muhammad , get some Islamic celebs on the phone -  Muhammad Ali, Hakeem Olajuwon, Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens)  - and put a travelling road show together.  SOMETHING!  You've got to make an attempt to turn this stuff around or it's only going to get worse. No one is out there on a consistent basis making your case that Islam is a religion of peace. True, actions speak louder than words and the only actions any Americans are seeing these days are suicide bombers, beheadings and all sorts of terror attacks but to not even try is unacceptable. If nothing else, the deafening silence most Americans hear from Islamic leaders too scared to speak out against the violence only confirms that all Muslims must truly seek the destruction of the United States. At worst, I'm thinking it's only 80/20. Minority, make yourself heard!  By the way, I'm going to try and stop referring to the terrorists as Islamic fundamentalists. I think  extremists  is a better term. Islam is, by its nature, fundamentalist, or so I heard it said by Islamic scholars on Charlie Rose. It has a different connotation than when we refer to our own, homegrown, Christian fundamentalists. You know, the ones who blow up Planned Parenthood clinics and kill doctors in the name of their god? At least when they do, the more level-headed followers of JC step up to the mic and condemn that type of violence.

        urlLink This  is why people have problems with the UN.  Please tell me why the UN, when passing a Security Council "resolution", sets a 30 day "deadline" (eery word in this case) for Sudan to halt the atrocities being perpetrated by the Arab militias (the Janjaweed). Militias the government is sponsoring. 50,000+ people have already died. How many thousands of men, women and children will be killed, raped and tortured in another 30 days?  The killing needs to stop immediately. Yet the UN SC is so toothless, weak and irrelevant, it can't even pass a resolution condemning genocide and imposing sanctions, the wording had to be changed to "measures" before it could even be acceptable to members.  Who the  fuck  could have a problem with implementing sanctions against a government supporting genocide against a segment of its population? Here's your answer:   The US removed any specific reference to sanctions in the resolution after objections from  seven members  - including China, Russia and Pakistan - who believe Khartoum needs more time to act.  The resolution was backed by 13 council members; China and Pakistan abstained.   Abstained? Red China abstained, big surprise. Their government has no problem with mass genocide, having destroyed Tibet over the past 5 decades. Pakistan? Our faithful partner in the war on terrorism has qualms about supporting "measures" against a genocidal government? Ohhhhhh, right, the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militias are Muslims (more good PR). Gotcha. Condemning one's own religious brethren would be bad form. Good thing we can rely on them to round up all of those nasty Taliban and al Qaeda in the Pakistani tribal areas. Hmm, but they are Muslim too. Could it be that their hearts are not really behind that effort either? They sure aren't capturing lots "evildoers" out of that country even though everyone agrees that is where most of the Talilban and al Qaeda members went, post-Afghanistan.  As the old saying goes, with friends like Pakistan, who needs enemies?

       I just caught wind of this  urlLink new treaty  being pimped by  Sen. Richard Lugar ,  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . In an oversimplified explanation, it would give European agents the right to spy on innocent American citizens. Simple or not, I certainly don't like the sound of that.   As the ACLU explains, the treaty "would expand police powers and require American authorities to conduct surveillance on individuals whose actions violate the laws of foreign countries but not US law... the Council on Europe's International Cybercrime Treaty was ostensibly created to help protect against cybercrime, but is drafted so broadly that it will affect far more than a few hackers."  One of the parties not invited to testify, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), sent a letter to Lugar and ranking Democrat Sen. Biden, outlining their concerns.  EPIC's first concern is the treaty's lack of privacy protections: "A significant number of provisions grant sweeping investigative powers of computer search and seizure and government surveillance of voice, e-mail, and data communications in the interests of law enforcement agencies, but are not counterbalanced by accompanying protections of individual rights or limits on governments' use of these powers."  Article 14 of the Treaty requires that "Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish the powers and procedures provided for in this section for the purpose of specific criminal investigations or proceedings... [including] collection of evidence in electronic form."  Thus, in their letter to Lugar, EPIC points out that language in the treaty can be read as requiring countries to "enact legislation compelling individuals to disclose their decryption keys in order to allow for law enforcement access to computer data."  EPIC also points out in the letter that Article 25 of the Treaty lacks a "dual-criminality" provision under which activity must be considered criminal in both countries before one country can demand the citizens of the other be spied upon.   We're getting just that much closer to signing up for the global police state, where the rights afforded to American citizens under our Constitution and Bill of Rights are superceded by international treaties our government signs on to.

       Alabama enacted a law in 1998 that  urlLink banned the sale of sex toys . A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling and endorsed the right of the state to police the sale of devices that can be sexually stimulating. I used a popsicle once on a girlfriend...  That in the late 90's a state legislature in this country actually introduced and subsequently passed a law banning sex toys is amazing. First of all, from a priorities standpoint, was this something that needed immediate legislative attention? Was the populace of Alabama in sudden peril from being overrun by sex toys? How do frivolous laws like this get passed? What do you want to bet that some sanctimonious, right-wing Christian conservative introduced and lobbied for this bill to be passed? On what grounds could you make an arguable case that the citizens of Alabama need to be protected by a law such as this? Was there a rash of injuries stemming from the sex toy use? Did the puritanical lawmakers of the red state of Alabama feel that its moral character was imperiled by consenting adults using sex toys in the privacy of their own home?   Furthermore, isn't this law just the tiniest bit sexist? Yes, all sorts of people use sex toys, men, women, black, white but when you think sex toys, doesn't common sense lead you to believe that vibrators and dildos are probably the most popular? Men who enjoy shoving objects into their rectum notwithstanding, doesn't common sense also lead you to believe that women are the ones really getting the short end of the dildo on this whole deal? When a predominantly male state legislature passes a specific law against sex toys isn't that, in essence, a direct swipe at pro-self-gratifying, pleasure loving women across the state? Wouldn't you think that would represent a fairly large constituency in Alabama?  Here's to hoping these free-spirited, unrepressed women form a countervailing lobbying group and see to it that these anti-women, anti-pleasure, right-wing, sanctimonious, Christian conservatives get voted straight out of office.  In the meantime, pleasure-seeking individuals in Alabama can always  urlLink order over the internet .

       Me likee  Thomas Frank  (I can't stop myself from saying this now, thanks BigBen). He's got a good handle on what's wrong with the Democratic Party, though he still can't figure out why blue-collar working people vote Republican, but then who can? Here, in an  urlLink LAT commentary , he discusses how clueless Dems are by trotting out celebs at their events. I agree, who the hell cares what celebs have to say (except for LibraKitty), Ben Affleck's politically astute mind notwithstanding.  The Democrats are today a party that has trouble rallying its historical working-class constituency, losing more and more of its base every four years to some novel culture-war issue invented by the wily Republicans: blasphemous art, Ten Commandments monuments in courthouses, the dire threat of gay marriage. Behind their success stands a stereotype, a vision of liberals as an elite, a collection of snobs alternately permissive and moralistic, an upper class that believes it is more sophisticated and tasteful than average people.  It is a pernicious doctrine, and yet there is a grain of truth to it. A grain of truth that get- togethers like this one — where minor stars swap righteousness with lobbyists, politicians and local venture capitalists — magnify into life-sized lessons in liberal elitism.  Now, it is an article of faith among American intellectuals that Hollywood movies are populist products; that they are uncomplicated translations of the public's desires into attractive images; that stars are stars because we love them; and that countries like France that resist Hollywood movies do so because they are snobs, dedicated to some daft mission civilatrice in which they will bring culture — in the form of arty, disjointed black-and-white films — to the masses. Masses, that is, who yearn in their hearts for nothing but more Hollywood fare.  If this were true, the problems of the Democratic Party would be over. After all, as this party makes clear, when Hollywood stars decide to get out there and do their patriotic duty and stump for the candidate of their choice, the candidates they support are usually Democrats.  But somehow it never seems to help. Somehow this glitzy world of risque dresses, pseudo-transgressive stylings and velvet ropes (i.e., the things that make up "creativity") has precisely the opposite effect on a huge swath of the American public. They hate it, and they hate everything that Hollywood has come to stand for. After all, Hollywood stars are as close as America comes to an aristocracy, and being instructed on how to be kinder and better people by pseudo-rebellious aristocrats can't help but rub people the wrong way.    What the stars' Democratic allegiance illustrates for this segment of the public is not the glamour of Democratic candidates but their repulsiveness and shallowness and insufferable moral superiority; their distance from the historical Democratic base of average Americans. For them, Hollywood's superficial leftism only validates the ludicrous claims of the Republicans to be the party of the common man.   ( emphasis  mine)  Word to BigBen's (not Affleck's) mom.

       Bill Cosby's soapbox crusade, for African-Americans to first look within their own community and culture to make positive changes, kept things going full tilt recently by  urlLink lashing out at rap music  during a speech to a college conference in Hilton Head, SC.

       Deep political thinker that I am, I really had one strong thought throughout John Edwards convention speech - What in the hell is that growth on his lip and why hasn't he gotten it taken care of? It was like the "white spot" on George Costanza's face in that Seinfeld episode, or the boil on Richard E. Grant's neck in "How To Get Ahead In Advertising". I just couldn't take my eyes off it and I just couldn't understand why a man with his financial means, who's in the public spotlight, hadn't gotten that taken care of years ago. Hell, it's not Cindy Crawford's "beauty mark" for god's sake and it's not like it's close to an artery or something. Lop the damn thing off!  Listen, I'm not saying that my vote for Kerry is in jeopardy or anything, just yet at least, but have some common decency and get that thing, lanced, frozen, lasered, or  something  because I can't look at that, or more honestly,   look away   from that, for the next 100 days, which at that point, if elected, he'll disappear down into the  Dick Cheney Memorial Secret Bunker , never to be seen or heard from again. It makes me uncomfortable to think a "skin anomaly" on someone's face is actually talking to me and frankly, it hurts his credibility as a second-in-command. For the record, I was not "on" anything while watching his speech (maybe that was the problem).  Take some time. Let the depth and breadth of this commentary sink in and you, too, will come to feel the way I do. Thank you and good day sir (or madam).

       Good stuff!   To Ben Affleck:   "You have a stunningly developed political mind, and I fear you."   Regarding Obama:   Matthews admitted to feeling "a little chill in my … legs right now." (He actually paused a little before "legs," as if struggling to locate the sensation.)   Regarding THK (who he admittedly has a boner for):   Discussing Teresa Heinz Kerry's controversial "Shove it" in the post-primetime wrap-up, he asked Richard Holbrooke, the Kerry adviser and former U.N. ambassador: "Do you think the American people have an appetite for a spicy woman of Latin background from Africa?" Ay caramba! Minutes later, he was confessing to no one in particular: "I don't mind saying I find her very attractive—a European film star in the vein of Jeanne Moreau, or Anouk Aimée. But not everyone loves foreign movies like I do."   Regarding himself (who he  also  has a boner for):   At one point, again addressing Holbrooke, he began, "I'm just wondering if you, as a political analyst …" After a pause (insofar as Chris Matthews can ever be said to "pause") he came to a realization: "Well, I'm a political analyst, I suppose."

       President Affleck?  For my money, the network whose coverage gets the closest to what it must feel like to be on the convention floor—some mixture of giddiness, boredom, patriotic fervor, and sugar shock—is MSNBC (and I don't say that just because their boss pays my bills).  Chris Matthews , the famously manic host of the talk show Hardball, tends to overpower his interview subjects in a more intimate format, but he's truly in his element at a political convention. The frantic pace, the pinballing clichés and counterclichés, the overwhelming influx of media stimuli, are the element in which he swims. During last night's pregame show, Matthews conducted a surprisingly in-depth 10-minute interview with  Ben Affleck , whose frat-boy screen demeanor belies a sharp eye for current affairs.  Matthews himself seemed stunned, even subdued, by the chops of his celebrity interlocutor, closing with the awestruck benediction: "You have a stunningly developed political mind, and I fear you. "  Not until they pry the outlawed, modified for automatic fire, M-16 out of my cold, dead hands.

       The Republican party has done a phenomenal job over the last couple of decades turning the word "liberal" into a tag that carries the same kind of negative equivalency, in political terms, as calling someone a racist or a wife-beater. Democrats are loathe to be painted with that label, yet the reverse is far from true when the word "conservative" is applied to a Republican. Why? Certainly I am one that subscribes to the message of this year's Democratic convention - that the Republicans are dividers - and their use of "liberal" as a derogatory term, or a political epithet if you will, perfectly underscores that charge. It's an Us vs. Them dichotomy that has been sadly very successful for conservatives as the Democrats gave up the term with nary a whimper. Broadly painting your opponent with a simplistic term that you, yourself, have redefined into something that implies the person is far outside the mainstream is the kind of one-dimensional, sound-byte mentality the public has devolved into.  How about someone embracing the term liberal? You call me a liberal? Well, if a liberal is someone who cares about the environment and is willing to fight to protect it so that our health is protected and our children have a cleaner, better world to grow up in, then I'm a liberal. If a liberal is someone who feels that government can be a positive force for change and for good, not only in our country but in the world, then I'm a liberal. If a liberal is someone who supports a strong defense and in doing so makes sure that not only are the men and women of our armed forces taken care of in the same heroic manner that they take care of us but that our most precious military resource, our soldiers, are only put in harms way in times of true national defense, based on clear facts, with a comprehensive strategy for victory while providing all of the necessary resources to get the job done, then I'm a liberal. If by liberal you mean someone who feels that the government needs to do a better job of improving our nation's educational system so that our children receive higher quality educations, so that they may better compete in the ever evolving global marketplace, then I'm a liberal. And if by being liberal I can reform and streamline the bloated, mismanaged and big pharma dominated healthcare system in this country so that all Americans can have access to quality healthcare, then I'm a flag-flying, card-carrying liberal. Now if all of those things make me a liberal, then I don't think you can get more mainstream than that. It is the people that make this country great and the more the government can do for them, the greater our country can be. Truly a continuing beacon of hope, prosperity, compassion, freedom and humanity that will continue to be the envy of the rest of the world.  Or something like that, when it's not written at 2am with one's contact lenses drying out in their eyes.  The Republicans continue to try and smear both Kerry and Edwards by calling them the #1 and #4 most-liberal Senators, when an  urlLink objective look at the facts  shows that both are very much centrists. But this Administration hasn't told the truth on anything over the last 4 years so why would any of us expect them to start now?

       FBI whistleblower, Sibel Edmonds, has been  urlLink partially vindicated  by a Justice Dept. investigation which has shown that, in part, she was fired for being a whistleblower in 2002.  Ms. Edmonds worked as a contract linguist for the F.B.I. for about six months, translating material in Turkish, Persian and Azerbaijani. She was dismissed in 2002 after she complained repeatedly that bureau linguists had produced slipshod and incomplete translations of important terrorism intelligence before and after the Sept. 11 attacks. She also accused a fellow Turkish linguist in the bureau's Washington field office of blocking the translation of material involving acquaintances who had come under F.B.I. suspicion and said the bureau had allowed diplomatic sensitivities with other nations to impede the translation of important terrorism intelligence.  The Edmonds case has proved to be a growing concern to the F.B.I. because it touches on three potential vulnerabilities for the bureau: its ability to translate sensitive counterterrorism material, its treatment of internal "whistle-blowers," and its classification of sensitive material that critics say could be embarrassing to the bureau.  The Justice Department has imposed an unusually broad veil of secrecy on the Edmonds case, declaring details of her case to be a matter of "state secrets." The department has blocked her from testifying in a lawsuit brought by families of Sept. 11 victims, it has retroactively classified briefings Congressional officials were given in 2002, and it has classified the inspector general's entire report on its investigation into her case. As a result, groups promoting government openness have accused the Justice Department of abusing the federal procedures in place for classifying sensitive material.  Where's Woodward and Bernstein when you need them? There is much more to this story than we know and Sibel Edmonds needs to be able to share what she knows, completely and without the government censoring her under guise of "national security". These days, it seems that the "national security" tag gets thrown on anything that could embarass or contradict the Bush Administration's versions of events and has little to do with any kind of security, except maybe JOB security.

        Ted Turner  was on   Charlie Rose   last week. In true Turner fashion, he let it rip.  "We wasted 200 Billion Dollars of our money (in Iraq), 100   Billion to destroy the infrastructure of the country, then   we had to pledge 100 Billion to build it back, to find one   guy who was hiding in a fox hole."    “History will look back at this debacle in Iraq as one of   the greatest mistakes that any major country every made --   as big a bad deal as Time Warner merging with AOL.  In one   move, we set the United States back at least 30 years, as   far as our International relations.  I mean it's gonna   take a *long* time and a lot of work to repair our   standing in the world."    "I said 'I felt as excited about signing the papers on   the (AOL Time Warner) merger as I did about having sex   for the first time' ... but I didn't really.  I was just   trying to make the shareholders happy."  Those are just some highlight to whet your appetite. I believe PBS will be re-airing this interview on Monday's Charlie Rose (check your local PBS station for details) for those of you that missed it the first time around.

       When is a  urlLink $420-$450 billion budget deficit  a  good  thing? I'm glad you asked. From the Bush Administration's standpoint, it's a good thing because the  original  budget deficit estimate was $521 billion, so they're coming in $70 - $100 billion lower! I, for one, have less qualms now about how the Bush Administration is handling the economy. The deficit is   only   going to be $400+ billion? I guess we can afford that malfunctioning boondoggle of a missile defense system now. Boy, are the military contractors glad to hear that. Hell, the war in Iraq has wound down to a low intensity conflict now, they are barely dropping any of those wonderfully named "smart bombs" anymore, so where were their 2004 bonuses supposed to come from? Looks like Santa's going to be good to the children of the military-industrial complex  again this year!

       Ladies and gentlemenen (a PE reference for you whiteys), introducing  Barak Obama . Taking center stage Tuesday night as the convention's keynote speaker, Obama definitely  urlLink stole the show .   Ronny Reagan Jr. ? What  ever  . No doubt his comments about the need for more aggressive stem cell research were relevant but one couldn't get over the surreal nature of him being a featured speaker at the Democratic Convention. It's certainly a blatantly opportunistic move by the Democrats that failed miserably with cynics like me.  I'm sure  Teresa  Heinz 57 Sauce  Kerry  is a lovely woman but her speech was nothing short of somnambulant. What in god's name were they thinking putting her up there for 15 or so minutes talking to a crowd? Was Boston experiencing a citywide Ambien shortage? No doubt that conventioneers slept soundly after her address. The only thing I hoped during her speech, for John Kerry's sake, was that she's more engaging one-on-one than she is speaking in front of a large crowd. Otherwise, he really  did  marry her for the money. Don't get me wrong, I scarcely believe I would do any better (visions of oratory skills the likes of Obama's notwithstanding) but why subject the country to such a bringdown so soon after Barak Obama had electrified the assembly?  So far, THK has been the only resounding THUD of the convention. That said, I'm not looking forward to Kerry's 60+ minute speech on Thursday. Edwards, on the other hand, once he gets past his blue collar, mining family roots review, should put on a good show. Veep candidates are traditionally the pitbulls, even though this has been a convention showcasing a kinder, gentler Democratic party.  Pardon my non sequitor but  Sean Hannity  from FNC is a cherlish dolt.   urlLink  Andrew Sullivan   is feeling Obama:  Conservative values, Democratic compassion. In the constant churn and dialectic of American politics, this is a new fusion - and the Dems have found a young, racially diverse, eloquent voice. Can you think of any current Republican with that kind of fresh appeal and smart politics? Only Arnold comes close. The Republicans would love to have someone of Obama's caliber - but they have failed to attract them. That is their tragedy, and it is only deepened in a party that gave rise to Trent Lott and Tom DeLAy. Obama is the Democrats' hope. Heck, he is the hope for all of us.  Arnold? Close? Maybe, if you happen to define "close" as "thousands and thousands of miles apart."

        William Saletan , chief political correspondent of   Slate.com  , is blogging from the DNC. Here is a section of an entry reviewing Bill Clinton's speech:  Clinton, the male version, is the night's last speaker, and he uses that position to pull together the strands of the preceding speeches. He praises Carter, who mistrusted him, and Gore, who came to resent him. In Clinton's all-forgiving, self-forgiving world, they and he and all Democrats are united. Next to patching things up with Hillary and Chelsea, this reconciliation is a piece of cake.  The tribute to Gore is painfully telling. Gore showed tremendous patriotism and grace during and after the 2000 recount, Clinton recalls. Indeed, Gore "is the living embodiment" of the principle that "every vote counts." In short, Gore will be remembered, even by his allies, as a good loser and an inanimate emblem.  All speeches at this convention are supposed to be positive, or at least to look positive. Clinton illustrates the difference. He promises "a positive campaign," unlike the nasty, negative campaign Republicans are running. Borrowing a page from Newt Gingrich (who loved to credit the sincere belief of "our liberal friends" in this or that perversion), Clinton stresses that the two parties have "fundamentally different views." Democrats believe in shared responsibilities, shared benefits, global cooperation, and giving everyone the tools to make the most of their lives. Republicans believe in clubbing baby seals. Well, not quite. According to Clinton, Republicans actually believe in elitist authoritarianism and concentrating wealth. But the message is almost as coarse. "They need a divided America," he concludes divisively. "But we don't."  Clinton can be almost as funny as Gore. He gets a round of laughter by marveling that since he left office and joined the GOP's favorite tax bracket, Republicans have become, through their tax policies, downright friendly to him. Then he twists the blade, explaining that he decided not to send Republicans a thank-you note for his tax cut because he realized that working folks were paying for it. Substantively, Clinton's speech isn't very different from his wife's; the GOP has shamefully defunded this program or that one, whereas Democrats will fund it. But the difference between his presentation and hers is the difference between singing and reciting. The delegates rise and applaud as he pounds the podium.  If you don't like what the Republicans are doing—taking cops off the street, putting tax cuts for the rich before homeland security—"take a look at John Kerry, John Edwards, and the Democrats," Clinton concludes. That's the most effective pitch of the evening, and it's not surprising that Clinton, the only Democrat in 20 years who has proved himself effective as a political strategist, was the one to figure it out. But by now, it's almost 11 p.m. Eastern Time, and Clinton's blistering rush to finish his speech before the networks sign off has failed. A speech that should have started 15 minutes earlier, to let the night's best speaker play out his "take a look" message, has been pushed to the edge of prime time and compressed to a pace difficult to follow. If only they'd given Clinton more minutes at the podium in exchange for fewer pages in his memoir.  The worst loss for the Democrats in this clock mismanagement is their failure to capitalize on Clinton's presidency as a success story. Kerry has been far more eager than Gore ever was to embrace and exploit Clinton's record of peace and prosperity. And Clinton tries to make that point tonight. We tried it the Republicans' way for 12 years, he says. Then we tried it our way for eight years. Then their way for another four. "Our way works better," he says.   The other thing Clinton represents is the intelligence Bush lacks. Bush 41 seemed like he didn't care, so we elected a president who at least seemed like he cared. Clinton seemed like a liar, so we elected a president who at least seemed too straightforward or dumb—call it whatever you want—to lie. Now it's time to elect a president who at least seems smart enough not to screw up a budget, an economy, and a war. "Strength and wisdom are not opposing values," says Clinton softly, and to my amazement, the convention hall erupts. People are standing and clapping. I thought the dig was too subtle—and the lesson too profound—to come across. But in this building, everyone gets it. We'll find out three months from now whether the folks at home agree.   That last paragraph is, in my view, dead-on. If Kerry can take whatever "bounce" he gets from the convention, campaign strong and stay on message for the next 100 days, he may actually have a chance to become the next POTUS. Day One of the DNC was a very impressive start.

       The lawmakers in Washington, DC are notoriously heavy-handed and prone to knee-jerk, reactionary legislation (Patriot Act anyone?) and in most cases are  driven by big monied corporate interests who call the shots. So as the thorny issue of copyright protection continues to fester, the major corporations whose value is in direct correlation to all of the copyrights they own have instructed their high paid lobbyists to make sure politicians protect their industry. What this is going to lead to is a significant stifling of technology and the evolution of the internet.  Do I believe that copyrights should be protected? Yes. Do I believe that lawmakers will craft an even-handed bill that would address many of the concerns of copyright holders while not choking off technological development? No.  The Sony Betamax decision led to the proliferation of VCR's which, rather than destroy the film industry, led to a substantial boost in overall revenue thanks to rentals and sales. It gave movies new life once they were finsihed their run in the theaters. Now, in the rush to squelch digital piracy, even that landmark decision is in jeopardy.  Once these draconian copyright laws are passed, and they will unfortunately pass, it will have a tremendously negative impact on the doctrine of "fair use", as well as technology. That's not good for consumers on any level and neither is it a good development for technology companies. The current piece of legislation on lawmakers' radar screen,  urlLink the INDUCE act , is unquestionably an unmitigated disaster waiting to be passed.

        urlLink Cover-up  regarding certain intelligence pointing to a foreign government assisting in the financing and logistics of 9/11? Pakistan you say? Key witnesses with vital information not questioned, released, or unable to testify? It sounds like there is some serious ass-covering going on, which means the public isn't getting the complete story on the 9/11 tragedy and how it could have happened.  The FBI, illegally, continues to refuse the to release of their agent Robert Wright's 500-page manuscript Fatal Betrayals of the Intelligence Mission, and has even refused to turn the manuscript over to Senator Shelby, vice-chairman of the joint intelligence committee charged with investigating America's 9/11 intelligence failures. And the US government still refuses to declassify 28 secret pages of a recent report on 9/11...  ... Senator Bob Graham, chairman of the Senate select committee on intelligence , has said:  "I think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted, not just in financing ... by a sovereign foreign government."  In that context,  Horst Ehmke, former coordinator of the West German secret services , observed:  "Terrorists could not have carried out such an operation with four hijacked planes without the support of a secret service."   That might give meaning to the reaction on 9/11 of Richard Clarke, the White House counter-terrorism chief, when he saw the passenger lists later on the day itself: "I was stunned ... that there were al-Qaida operatives on board using names that the FBI knew were al-Qaida." It was just that, as Dale Watson, head of counter-terrorism at the FBI told him, the "CIA forgot to tell us about them".  These are just excerpts (emphasis mine). The whole commentary is worth a read.

       OK, so I'm on a little Village Voice blogging jag, sue me. Nice little  urlLink hatchet job on Cheney , whom I despise.  Some bon mots:  Although the punditry was united in its conviction that the vice president's place on the ticket was secure, this didn't alter the basic facts about his dour unlikability. Cheney's a Wyoming Hobbesian whose doom-laden vision of life as a dog-eat-dog struggle has not only defined our nation's foreign policy but his own public persona. He's become one of our pop culture's sickest jokes. When most Americans under 30 think of Cheney, they picture Eminem electrocuting him with his defibrillator in the great "Without Me" video or Saturday Night Live's Darrell Hammond portraying him as a maniac prone to bursts of mad glee—only half his face can smile.   My favorite part, for all you Brooks lovers out there:  With his conservative rhetoric and corporate values—he's the military-industrial complex made flesh—Cheney could be the poster boy for the bait-and-switch conservatism dissected by Thomas Frank, whose new book What's the Matter With Kansas? provides a trenchant antidote to the sociological maunderings of David Brooks, the Pangloss of patio culture. For the last several years, Frank argues, the right has perfected a potent two-pronged political strategy. It pursues "free market" policies that hurt working people while making the rich even richer, yet hides this economic class war behind a rhetorical class war against the amoral, latte-slurping "liberal elites," who supposedly don't share the "values" of ordinary people. This story line lets the Republicans speak a populist lingo while pursuing an anti-populist economic agenda.   The 2 of you who are regular readers of POE will recall I blogged about Frank last week.

       A kid in San Francisco faked his own beheading by Islamic militants, uploaded it to a file-sharing network, all in an effort to help his effort to be elected to the SF Board of Supervisors.  What?     Shrugging and taking a drink from a diet soda, Vanderford said he originally made the video as a way to draw attention to his campaign for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He filmed the footage at a friend's house, using fake blood.  When his political aspirations waned, he decided to distribute the footage on Kazaa, which is used to trade millions of audio, video and software files daily, ''to just make a statement on these type of videos and how easily they can be faked.''  Although the video went for months without drawing attention, it spread quickly after it was posted on a militant Islamic Web site that has previously carried claims of violent acts that eventually were verified.   America's new strategy - undermine the enemy through false confidence.

       The more I  urlLink read about it , the more  pissed  I am that I missed Affleck on Chris Matthews' show during the DemCon. Here's some of the transcript and I begrudingly admit, Affleck comes off as very relaxed and funny. Although they don't reprint any of his  allegedly  astute political observations, they do allow him this:  MATTHEWS: Ben Affleck stays with us right now, where he’s going to join some of our colleagues . . . Dee Dee, David and Lois, who wants to talk to Ben Affleck?  MYERS: I’ll talk to Ben Affleck . . .  GERGEN: Ben, this is David Gergen. I think a lot of us are blown away here by your vocabulary. Without being pedantic or scatological, you sure do elucidate pretty well.  AFFLECK: Well, David, I think I benefit from the same thing that helped George Bush in the debates, which is tremendously low expectations.  Now that is astute  and  funny! But wait, there's more...  MATTHEWS: When you saw Arnold Schwarzenegger get elected governor of California last year rather handily, in a big surprise entry into politics, a man that wasn’t even born in this country, did you have a little tingle that said, Maybe me someday — governor, senator, president?  AFFLECK: Well, I thought, at least, you know, if I did get elected, nobody could accuse me of being the worst actor who ever got elected to public office.  Apparently Affleck is a much better political pundit than he is an actor. I also have to give him credit for being genuinely funny in a wonky setting.

       Entertaining  urlLink recap  of the Democratic National Convention by John Powers in the   LA Weekly  . Not so much for the event itself but for his media observations. I've found the most interesting reading, post-convention, has been all of the media criticism that's been generated.  Of course, I can't help but wonder where all of this scrutiny and criticism of the media itself was prior to, and during, the War in Iraq but I suspect the more engaged analysis of the media these past few months is directly related to the now obvious failings they exhibited. Plus, there is a penchant in this country for "piling on" and kicking people or institutions when they are down.  Not necessarily something to be proud of but it can sure lead to some entertaining reading!

       A common microbe is responsible for  urlLink 100 deaths  at a Quebec hospital over the last 18 months.  A bacterial agent commonly found in health-care settings has been blamed for the deaths of 100 patients in the last 18 months in a single Quebec hospital, says an infectious disease expert at the facility, who is calling for government action to forestall more outbreaks across the country.  Dr. Jacques Pepin says cases of Clostridium difficile at University Hospital in Sherbrooke have been steadily increasing. And the incidence among those most vulnerable to the disease — patients aged 65 and older — jumped 10-fold between 1991 and the end of 2003.  The infection has been blamed for killing 54 patients in 2003 and another 46 in the first six months of this year at the 683-bed hospital, said Dr. Pepin, lead author of a study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.  Using patient records, the University of Sherbrooke researchers compiled cases of C. difficile and deaths from the infection over the last 14 years. They found the proportion of patients who died within 30 days of diagnosis soared to almost 14 per cent in 2001 from less than 5 per cent in 1991.   Mayonnaise on french fries and now this? Tres mal!

       Aussie copyright law forbids people from uploading music to their iPod from their own CDs or computer hard drive. iTunes has no Aussie outlet and you can't buy from the US store.  urlLink Copying music for personal use is illegal . Therefore the 100,000 iPods sold in Australia so far are, legally speaking, expensive paperweights.  This is copyright law gone amuck in the 21st Century. Buckle up because it's only going to get worse.

       US Airways diverted a shuttle flight between Boston and DC to pick up the  urlLink Bush twins , whose own flight was delayed due to the mechanical problems. The shuttle flight ended up arriving in DC two hours late. The horror!

I would have no problem making an unscheduled stop for Jenna Bush...

       Sandy Berger,  urlLink cleared ? I hadn't read about any of this or seen it on any of the cable news channels. Should I stop watching Fox News? But Rupert needs my money, doesn't he?  Last Friday the Wall Street Journal uncovered some actual news and shot down a key flank of the Republican talking points on the Berger controversy.  The paper reported that National Archive officials looking into the Berger affair had determined "no original materials are missing and nothing Mr. Berger reviewed was withheld from the commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks."  The Journal report continued, "Daniel Marcus, general counsel of the 9/11 Commission, said the panel had been assured twice by the Justice Department that  no originals were missing and that all of the material Mr. Berger had access to had been turned over to the commission. 'We are told that the Justice Department is satisfied that we've seen everything that the archives saw,' and 'nothing was missing,' he said."

       This intrepid Boston Globe reporter makes a  urlLink ridiculous claim  that because Apple's best-selling iPod (3 million sold and counting) is proprietary in nature, only playing music files from its iTunes service, which utilizes its "FairPlay" digital rights management and does not allow its files to be played on other digital music players, nor play files from the other digital music services such as Napster, that it effectively encourages stealing. Forcing people to go to use P2P sites like Kazaa to get all of their music. That's like saying if I buy a gun for home protection, Smith & Wesson is encouraging me to enter into a life of armed robbery or murder. DVD-Audio discs don't play in my CD player, SACD's don't play in my DVD player. Proprietary formats are nothing new. Consumers make a choice. What levels the playing field is equal availability of all titles in every medium.  When I buy an iPod, I understand going in that it only works with the iTunes music service AND any MP3 music files I may already have on my computer. I'm not sure I see how that suddenly implants visions of criminality in my head.  Apple has done more than ANY company to offer a legal, easy and comprehensive system for consumers to download music from the internet. Rather than demonize them, why not focus on the true culprits - the music industry. If the industry would catch up and respond to comsumer demand, they would make ALL of their music catalog available equally to all of the digital music download services and let the consumer make the final decision about how they would like to access and purchase their downloads.  All this journalist is doing is engaging in some kind of biased vendetta against Apple and their cutting-edge products and making an outlandish claim that buying an iPod will turn people into digital music pirates. Nothing could be further from the truth and it is just plain wrong to suggest otherwise.

       It's that time of year again, when bands and musicians turn into  urlLink voter registration activists  and exhort the youth of America to make their voices heard in the upcoming Presidential election.  "We need a change."   "You are the future." , so on and so forth. You see it happen every 4 years and from what I can tell, it makes no discernable difference whatsoever. To begin with, if a band or a musician needs to point out the importance of voting then whoever is listening really doesn't "get it" or very much care in the first place.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for increased participation in the democratic process by the youth of America.  Rock The Vote , the granddaddy of all "get out the youth vote" organizations, and all of the others that blossom every 4th spring, are pursuing an admirable goal by signing up newly elegible voters, as well as coaxing the disenfranchised 20-somethings back into participatory fold. After all, it is  their  collective futures being bargained, legislated, bankrupted and terrorized away by the current administration. Yet somehow I can't get too excited about all of these potential newly registered voters actualy making a difference. OK, so they have signed up and been given a "tool to exercise their democratic duty" but no one has really educated them on how to use the tool properly. It's just not enough to vote. You need to commit the time and energy to familiarize yourself with the issues that are important to you and to seek out what the candidates' positions are on these issues so you can cast your vote intelligently and really make it count. Unfortunately, too little of this is actually done by voters of  every  age these days.

       Sudan launched helicopter attacks in Darfur  urlLink today . It sure looks like they "need more time" according to the Arab League and several members of the UN Security Council, except what they need time for is more genocide and that's what needs to be stopped. Now.   Despite recent pledges to cooperate to end the humanitarian crisis the U.N. has called the worst in the world, the U.N. said the Sudanese government has hampered access to hungry Darfuris by restricting relief flights and causing "major delays" in deployment of aid workers.  The world body also said Sudanese authorities were pressuring traumatized refugees to return to unsafe villages.   "We have interviewed people in hospital who tell us they have gone back to the villages, believing the government commitment, and have been shot by Janjaweed raiders,"  said United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Peter Kessler in Geneva.  "We can't tell if people are being led into a trap -- we would hope not," he added.  Meanwhile, a human rights group said civilians in Darfur are being routinely imprisoned or harassed by Sudanese authorities for talking to foreigners about the conflict in the remote western area bordering Chad.  London-based rights group Amnesty International said in a report Sudan had rounded up scores of people who spoke to journalists and foreign leaders, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, on recent visits to Darfur.

       The Arab League is fronting for the Sudanese government,  urlLink saying they should be given more time to end the crisis , you know, the one where state-backed  Arab  militias are slaughtering thousands of black Africans in the Darfur region.  This is what incenses me. We go into Iraq under false pretenses and then our government makes some half-hearted claim that part of our "intervention" in Iraq was for humanitarian reasons, yet when we are clearly looking at genocide being carried out in Sudan - we do nothing. We don't lift a finger. Sure, we get a resolution passed in the UN Security Council, one that had to be significantly watered down before it could pass, but how many lives has that saved so far? What about the thousands of people who have been killed and will be killed since that resolution passed and before something effective is actually done?  What is so hard about forcing the Sudan government to stop backing the Arab militias and sending their own troops in to restore order? Clearly the Sudanese government's reluctance to do so shows their complicity in the slaughter. I would say that with their recent intervention, the Arab League too are complicit in the ongoing slaughter of thousands of black Africans.  Why is it that the rest of the world so devalues African lives? So much so that no one has done a single thing to help stop this horrible genocide. Even after the terrible expereince in Rwanda during the 90's, the West is still sitting on it's hands, content to let the "savages" fight it out amongst themselves. It's covert racism that really not all that covert.  Nobody is coming out looking good in this so far, the West, the UN but the Arab League should be ashamed of itself for coming out and tacitly supporting the despicable actions by the Sudanese government by insisting that they be given more time before any sanctions are enacted.  Lives are being lost every day. The longer the rest of the world takes to respond to this type of mass murder, the greater the message is to African despots that no one cares about what happens on the African continent.

       As we pioneer further into the digital age, one audio/video casualty will be "fair use"  (that noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over the public airwaves is a fair use of copyrighted works and does not constitute copyright infringement. Any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work for a "fair use"; the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right to such a use.) . The legal concept of "fair use" is something that came into existence when Universal sued Sony over their Betamax player/recorder. The concept of "fair use" has stood since 1984. Now music and entertainment companies are attacking the concept and winning.  Disney is hammering the FCC hard:  The FCC is considering whether to impose a "broadcast flag" content protection scheme on digital broadcast radio (a.k.a. DAB or HD Radio). The RIAA is pushing for the flag, which would impose FCC technology mandates on all future digital radio receivers. Apparently, the MPAA's success in getting preemptive FCC regulation of next generation televisions emboldened the RIAA to seek a similar regime for digital radio.  EFF has filed two sets of comments on this issue. Now, you may be wondering why we care about this little FCC backwater proceeding. After all, nobody has an HD Radio yet. The format might not even succeed. So who cares?  Well, in their latest comments, Disney (which is an RIAA member, and owns ABC Radio Networks and four record labels) let slip what this is all about:      In addition, to the extent the Commission considers such a content protection mechanism, it should also consider whether to extend that mechanism to all music distribution platforms, including satellite digital audio radio service, the Internet and broadcast radio service.  Got that? Disney wants the FCC to regulate all devices capable of recording from any audio broadcasting medium or from the Internet. FM radio, XM, Sirius, Streamripper, Total Recorder, you're all in the crosshairs. It's the Hollings Bill all over again.   Despite all of the benefits of digital video and digital audio, the one negative thing it does allow is greater control by the copyright holders. As a result, we are seeing "fair use"-inhibiting technology being built in to HDTV sets and now, potentially and probably, next generation radio.  Not to sound like a luddite but it presents a strong case for staying analog, since they can't control those ports yet. Trouble is, over the next 10 years we'll see all analog ability disappear precisely because it cannot be controlled as digital can.

       Those of you who are my regular readers (both of you) will remember my boisterous post several months back regarding  Syd Schanberg 's  urlLink article  in   The Village Voice   about John Kerry's  alleged  Vietnam POW cover-up.  I'd be remiss if I didn't link out to his  urlLink most recent article  on this subject, proferring the evolved claim that the now unholy alliance of Kerry/Cheney are covering up the real story on Vietnam POW's.  Department of full disclosure: I am not someone who wants John Kerry to lose this election. To my mind, he is clearly a better man and leader than his opponent, who has lost his way. But he is also a man who, like many politicians embedded in government for a long time, has on some occasions allowed his ambition and perhaps his hubris to cloud his judgment. So why, with this piece, have I now written two stories for the Voice (and dozens of other stories elsewhere in the past) about Kerry's role as chair of that committee—stories that might cost him some votes? The answer is twofold. First, history and honesty are consequential. A nation can't claim to be a beacon of democracy for the world if the beacon is built on a foundation of lies.  And second, this story has become personally important to me, probably because of my life's arc. I've been in the army, and I've been a war reporter in India and Indochina, where military people have looked out for me. I have learned that duty, honor, country, and band of brothers are not words to be used lightly in political campaigns. I have learned never to confuse soldiers with the policies of the men in a nation's capital who have sent them into war. And I believe that abandoning men who have fought under their nation's flag is a terrible betrayal.  In his Democratic convention speech last week, Kerry said: "We have it in our power to change the world again. But only if we're true to our ideals—and that starts by telling the truth to the American people."  I hope John Kerry will turn out to be a different kind of leader. I hope he digs deep and tells us the truth about the band of men—not the "small number" they were reduced to in his committee's report—who were left behind in 1973 in Vietnam. That would truly be a fresh start.   Those of you out there that have a conscience will not want the blood on your hands a vote for Kerry/Edwards  or  Bush/Cheney would bring. Therefore, through sheer elimination, the only safe vote to be cast is for Ralph Nader! Whoooooooo Aaaaaaaah! Let's get ready to rumble!
