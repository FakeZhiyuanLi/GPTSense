      Ok, so I am sure that at least of few people out there stumbled upon the speech that John Kerry gave last night as his acceptance for the nomination for president.  I tuned in to see what kind of stuff he would say and if he would tell the nation what his plans are for his term if elected.  All in all i thought it was a good speech and he has some good ideas and plans.  I can't say that i disagree with what he wants to do as president for the majority of the population, but what i can say, or ask if you will, is 'what are you going to do to get it done?'.  I'm sure that most peope don't realize that the President is not as powerful as they say, and the Presidential candidates should know that, most of all the President himself.  Now don't get me wrong, the President is powerful, but most of the final descisions are made by the House of Reps and the Senate.  Yes, the president can propose actions and laws, but the Senate and/or House of Reps has to aprove it with its 2/3 vote.  If less than that apporove, the law or action dies.  That's it, it can be proposed again, but don't count on it getting more votes to pass it unless it is reworked and presented in a more appealing way.  That is just a small part of what Power the President has, or doesn't.  So, in my opinion, John Kerry gave some nice ideas about what he wants to do and all and it would be nice to see some of them come to pass if he became the President, but he of all people should know that when it comes to votes in the Senate, The President can only hope that a law or action gets passed.  This is why we went to war in Iraq, not because the President said "i'm bored, let's start a war", its because he presented the reasons for going to war and then the senate voted on it and it was approved, and yes John Kerry voted to go to war.  Any way, to wrap this up, I won't be making my decision until after i see Bush and Kerry debate about certain issues. Character and the manner in which they present themselves and in how consistant they are with thier answers, to me, are key to understanding their intentions adn motives.  Also, the candidates for Senate are very important as well, they vote on issues that the president and other Senators present. So that is where your Laws and Approvals will come from.
