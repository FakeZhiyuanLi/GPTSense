      what does it take to love someone by Leo~  love, what does it takes to love someone? does it takes everyday care? does it take a rose between your lips? maybe it takes more than atrractiveness. maybe it takes time, and time alone. touching her? seeing her? or just communicating with her? but is that enough? not really.... not at all? if u can't feel her smooth lips if u can't comb your finger through her silky hair if u can't be close to her, to her heart, to the every beat it makes what do u got? nothing! love is immaterial u say? who knows.. maybe it is maybe all it takes is one sweet word one strong will.. one i love u swing by your ear and u shall be touched? completely enthralled? does it make u wanna pour yourself in me? ensconce on my chest as u dream? no? thought so.. is love a strong word? or is it so powerless that it doesn't mean nothing? u know wat it takes? then guide this charging arrow to where it should go.
