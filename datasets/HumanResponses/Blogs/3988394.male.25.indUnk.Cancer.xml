       As my life moves towards things I don't want. I feel myself drawing inward into me. Closing myself off from the outside world. Becoming quieter and quieter..friends aren't acting like true friends...love that can't be had...because we can't do distance. Not sure where I'm going to live for a month. This adds up...this may be more than I can take. The love that's lost is the hardest to deal with. I can make new friends...I can find someone to take me in. I just want that feeling again..LOVE Its been too long from the last time. I've said I want a change in my life...to find someone I respect like I do you. To stop running through "girls". To let someone get in and be close to me. To push aside the walls and let them see the real me. "To be love and to love some else" Simple things if you just look at it typed out like that. Its another for it to actually happen. I go on the hopes of it will happen "someday". Someday seems too far too unknown. Is it wrong to to want that now?

       Did I put more into this than I should? Are my emotions getting the better half of me? Do you feel anything close as the way I do? Are you pulling away now? These are the questions that keep running around in my head. As the time grows closer for you to leave I am seeing you less and less. I think its four more days I have left with you. And then your gone not close enough for me to have and hold. I telling myself that I shouldn't be feeling this way. But, I can't help how I feel I guess. I think that's it, you took me off guard. I wasn't ready to meet someone like you. I'm truly glad that I did and I wouldn't change that for anything. Please know that I will be ok. That I will look on this as something pleasant in my life...and I need nice things in my life right now. I know I'm not losing you. We will still talk and see each other from time to time. I just wish it was more....

        As I've said before I wish I could make my words as beautiful as yours. You inspired me to as least try. To express myself whatever way I could. I know our time together was short...I know I will take you with me where ever I go. And I'm pretty sure you'll do the same. But, I do feel cheated! Cheated because this fantastic person is being taken from me as soon as I found her.
