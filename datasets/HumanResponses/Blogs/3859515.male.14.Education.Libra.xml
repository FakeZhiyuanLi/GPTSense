      How terribly sad a teenager I am. Well, I guess you couldn't limit that statement to just me, but ol' Sonny's gonna tell you a little story about being a teenager.   It feels great to be released from conforming to an academic calender created by caffeine induced beauricratical zombies you call school administrators. I just got dismissed from Summer School Session I. But I'd hate to say it, dear reader(s), I can't stand vacations longer than 3 weeks. That's the complete and utter truth. This morning I was so bored, I even made my dad coffee. I hate my da... I mean coffee.   So dear reader(s), I leave you with this: no matter how much the teens in your life bitch and moan about going to school, they'll bitch more inside that they're not made a tool. And by tool I mean not going to school. It's bloody boring when there's nothing to do but watch T.V. from 7:30AM-2:15PM MON-FRI. I just wanted to be more poetic in my statement.  Neurotically Yours, Sonny A.G.II

      I'm not a professional, what do you call those guys? T.V. critics, right! But I can tell you that Fox Network's new show "Method & Red" is deftly unfunny.   It's filled with stereotypical statements that naturally come out of a teen oriented show. Damn strait, I'm a teenager, but I didn't find it to be all that great. It has all the black vs. white mentallity as evident in Method Man's momma telling him, as an adolescent mind you, "& nooo white women!" Okay, now that may be partially funny, but they tried to pull off the whole little suburbian white kid. And this white kid, he is sooo white. He starts rapping. RAPPING! I thought that was just sad. It was just a way to interate a character into the show. And what the hell is up with the him and his "hooteehoo!!". Stu-Pid. Plus, the whole respect yo mama thing. That's where the show turns into an Afterschool Special.   I live in Northeren California and the constant interuption of public announcements to "buy California Grown" from his honorable Arnold Schwartzenneger(SP) *sigh* irritated me and maybe that messed with my opinnion, but nevertheless I say--GHETTO! And not in a good way.   Crazy in California,  Sonny A.G. II

      What an uneventfull day. It's almost satirically ironic to start a blog on such a dull day. *note to self: get thesaurus and find another word for "day". I dunno. I guess the most logical thing to start off with is to introduce myself...  Hi, my name is Sonny, and I'm an alchoholic. What?! This isn't "Alcholics Anonymous".  Sonny. What a dull name. I'm not used to having the name "Sonny" and I doubt I ever will get attatched(sp) to it. Of course there's my parents are okay with it. They are the ones who gave it to me. I still kinda get a funny look when I introduce myself to folks. People are always trying to associate me with either that damn flamming peice of crap in the sky we call a "sun" (Sunny) or that crappy singer Sonny Bono (he died while skiing, slamming into a tree) or a gangster of the prohibition era (Sonny Lisp?).  I'm 14. Quite an exciting age to be, but in 3 more months I'll be 15. Meh, age to me is just a number. I think it just matters how you feel inside. You can be as young as you want to be. Just take care of yourself. Take care of your body as well of your soul and age will be nothing more that a number. Jack LaLane anybody?  Like I said earlier in this passage, today was VERY dull. I woke up at like 10am or something and opened my window. Took a deep breath and looked outside. The sky was blue as like any other summer in good ol' Stockton, but I could damn well feel the heat of it too. So, fueled by the heat of Summer's July Sun, I decided to go to sleep. Now it's about 11:07 PM. Just woke up a little while ago and started writing this.   'Tis time I bid you all adieu. For sleep, grand sleep awaits me. Got Summer School, no?  Your alchoholic literary entertainer, Sonny G.

      The California Youth Think Tank, eh. So, guess you may be asking yourself what the California Youth Think Tank is. It's a 4 day debate retreat hosted by a one Mr. William Young, a.k.a. Brandy's t.v. dad on the once acclaimed show "Moesha".   I attended it with a little apprehension. It was held in L.A. this year; specifically the University of Southern California, and I'm from way up here in Stockton. It's a clear 8 hour drive from here to there, but that being said, I would not trade the experience for the world. I met new people there and, even though I was homesick, my fellow delegates (who are from all over CA) made me feel like I was just at a school event. I'm just going to bore you with my experience. It's just a "you'd have to be there" type event.  I want to end this post by saying that you should definetly get involved in this if you're in high school or even early college.
