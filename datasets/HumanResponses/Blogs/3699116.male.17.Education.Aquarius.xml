      You know what's going down? Ill tell you. I, Chuck Stevens, am going to be a rock star. You watch. I do not care one bit about all of those people out there who think its not gonna happen. Let me tell you, I play guitar, and I am going to get the best band going. Anyone who sees us will think "Holy hell, those guys kick ass." It might be hard to get a band started, but once we do, there's no turning back. I am gonna give myself 3 to 5 years before my band is on MTV and VH1. When (not if) it happens, the following people will be susceptable to free backstage passes: Cody Blevins, Greg Wheeler, Eli Snoeberger (if not in the band), Kenny Garrison, Adam Garrison, Matt Hicks, Todd Purple, Chris Anderson, Brad Bardos(if not in the band), Dustin McManomy, Clint Suitors, Michael Blackwell, and any hot ass girl who is not stuck up. Some of these females will include, but not be limited to: Morgan McDonald, Sara Allen, Chastin Minick, Maggie Bowen, Kori Keller, Sara Hall, Abby Pickett,  Britney Morgan, Brittany Moody, Allyson Collins, Katie Howard, and Britni Reagon. Ashley Whiteman is also subject to free backstage passes. If your name is not on this list, then you are not completely out of the picture. Perhaps I simply forgot to include your name on this list. If you feel this list is incorrect, please e-mail your corrections to ChuckDaddy_2005@yahoo.com. I realize that there is some room for error, and that I could very easily have forgotten to add your name. If that's the case, then as I previously stated, e-mail your corrections to me. Rock on!!!!  CHUCK $TEVEN$

      Chadam = Chuck And Adam  We are like Beavis and Butt Head. The reason I say this is we do the stupidest things. Adam looks like Beavis. I don't specifically look like Butt Head, however I could pull off the role of him. We have gotten ourselves in and out of trouble on numerous occasions. In fact, last week Adam took his brother's car to Supertest on 350 to put gas in. He went in to pre-pay and I got in the driver's seat and took control, not knowing the pump was still attached. The pump entirely came off. We simply went inside the store and said "Uh, dude, the pump is like off or something." We supposedly didn't know the pump was off. The guy got pissed and called the people from "before" dickheads. I thought that was a funny moment. We have done everything from setting up to roadblocks to TP'ing one Cody Blevins' residence when he was out of town. There have been many times when we have flipped off innocent pedestrians and civilians walking alongside the road. In fact, today Adam and I flipped off an elderly lady and told her she was "fucking old." We call overweight people fat asses and have been chased many times. I feel that if we continue, we are going to be assassinated. The end.

      Life is crazy. There is usually nothing to do and all sorts of stuff can happen. Life to me is too short. My friend Evan was driving to school for baseball practice on a windy and rainy morning. The time was about 6:25 am. He was 16 and had just gotten his license about a month before this. He was going 95 and went to pass a semi. His car hydroplaned and he spun out, hit two trees, and landed in a creek backwards. He died that day. It was March 5, 2004. He was fighting with his brother that morning and was speeding because he was pissed off. Another reason he was speeding was because the baseball coach told him that if he was late then he had to run all practice. His dad yelled " Have a good day" out the window. Evan was upset and just drove off. After his brother found out that there was an accident, he called Evan's cell phone to apologize. The phone was ringing in his pocket when one of the guys arrived at the scene. Things like this make me look at life in a different manner. I know he would have had a great life because he was a good guy and EVERYBODY liked him. I just don't know why stuff happens for no reason like that. It is terrible to even think about the severity of that. I just can't imagine all of the guilt and pain his older brother has inside. Every time I think about it I get this feeling of sadness. Things like this are the things that make me be upset with life.
