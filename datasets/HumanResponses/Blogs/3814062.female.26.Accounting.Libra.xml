      So anyway, here is my blog.  I've been petrified that if I started a "blog" I would be confused with the teenagers who say "wtf" and "omg" LIK LOL!!!1!@ and stuff.  Not me.   A little bit about me.. I drive too fast, swear too much, suffer from extreme fits of road rage, I struggle with anxiety (without the help of meds, thank you).  I have 2 baby-daddys, and although they are on opposite ends of the spectrum personality-wise, they both SUCK.  I don't have very many friends, because I am shallow and loyal.  The friends I do have, I have known for a long time.  I'm uncomfortable forming new bonds, because I'm not a trusting person.  The baby-daddy's ruined that for me.  Also I have a little to blame on my father.  But this isn't therapy so we won't get into that.   Right now I would describe my situation as "starting over".  Having been recently evicted.. I started a new job a month ago.. I move into my new place next weekend.  (July 10th)  I would classify that as a new start.  New job, new place, new chance to get my shit together.  (Can I say shit?)  My friend has been so gracious as to open her home to my kids and me.  I'm not saying it's a riot, it's just very kind of her to help us out.  I'm excited to get settled in to the new place and get my new life started.    My next post will include everything you ever wanted to know about me.  (Frightening) Until next time, tip your bartenders and waitresses.  They are the ones getting you drunk enough to have the balls to hit on the hot guy/girl across the bar.
