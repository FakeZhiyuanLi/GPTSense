      I have had a request to publish my article on “2 in the pink 1 in the stink” and why girls love it so much.  This young lady was very interested to know why as a girl she loved 2 in the pink one in the stink so much.   For the sake of those involved we won’t use her real name, lets just call her Montgomery.  Montgomery had tried it recently and was thrilled with the results.  She is quoted as saying “I can’t get enough, 2 in the pink 1 in the stink is the best thing to happen to me since the gang bang back in 2002”.  She then proceeded to offer her services in any clinical trials for my article.  I politely reminded her that I was married, so stop looking.  As a professional I try to separate my work and my personal life.  When I go to the Bank I prefer to do my banking business without my professional life getting involved.  Next week I hope to have my article “2 in the pink 1 in the stink” ready for publication.  Until then perhaps she can control herself as a courtesy to one professional to another.

      Depending on where you are and how pretty she is you can get some Poontang for $50-$100.  But that’s not the answer I’m looking for. I want to know is in a relationship/dating how much does that first taste of Poontang cost?   Let’s set up some ground rules for this study.   1st.  Everyone has a story of I met some girl in a bar she came home with me and after I gave her 2 in the pink 1 in the stink we went to bumpin uglies.  We are going to assume that these experiences are few and far between for the majority of the male population. 2nd.  Although fun, Strippers and Hookers don’t count. 3rd.  Although I know there were sluts in high school most guys still didn’t get any.  We are going to assume for the sake of the study that most guys (80%) went through high school and most of college without getting any.  Those lucky guys (20%) who did get some “We who are Poontang less salute you”. 4th.  We start all real dating at age 16. (6th grade slumber parties don’t count.  Although if you scored more power to you)  So for those guys who didn’t hit it, and those who did manage to get a little here and there, how much did it cost them in their pursuit of Poontang.  Let’s estimate some cost: Lets assume that on average a guy takes his girlfriend out once a week for dinner $25 and a movie $15. For a total of $40 a week. That’s a total of $2,080 a year.  But let’s not forget Birthdays, Christmas, Easter, Valentines Day, plus all the Anniversaries, when we met, our first date, when we started going out, our first kiss.  Altogether $220 extra.  (Of course I realize these estimates are on the low end but we are trying to get a ruff minimum estimate so bear with me.)  So add it all up and it cost guys $2300 a year in their pursuit of the seldom seen but always quested after Poontang.  Think back to your first time.  How many years did you pay for date after date, hoping, waiting, for even just a glimpse.  1 year		$2,300 2 years		$4,600	 3 years		$6,900 4 years		$9,200 5 years		$11,500 6 years		$13,800 7 years		$16,100 8 years		$18,900 9 years		$20,700 10 years	$23,000   Now somewhere there’s a guy (let’s call him Joe) who’s thinking to himself, I got married at age 20 and that was my first time.  So I only had to pay for 4 years.  He’s thinking I only paid $9,200 for my first time. Well the sad fact is he’s wrong, oh so wrong!!  He got married.  Marriages cost money.  Side note: (Surprisingly the average cost for a wedding and honeymoon together is $20,000.  And before you freak out and think I just making stuff up that is an accurate number.  Yes I know a lot of people spend less but we are doing averages here in this study.)  But back to Joe, when you add up the 4 years of dates $9,200 and the wedding $20,000 it cost him $29,200 for his first time.  That’s the cost of a college education.  That’s the cost of a nice car or truck. That’s 1450 lap dances.  That’s enough to send $1.50 a day to a starving Ethiopian for 53 years.  (Yes I know I am quiet the humanitarian)   We will come back to Joe later let’s move on to Brian.   Brian is 23 he’s been dating for 7 years.  He has spent $16,100 on his quest for Poontang and tonight he’s finally going to get some.  Although thrilled a few months later and a few rodeos later the relationship ends.  And this is the way it goes for Brain for the next 3 years he dates a girl for 4-8 months gets some Poontang, gets tired of the bitchin, and its over.  When he’s 26 he finally finds the one and decides to get married.  So what did it cost our friend Brian  $16,100 for his first time $6,900 for those three years of on and off Poontang relationships $20,000 for the wedding to guarantee Poontang on a regular basis $43,000 TOTAL  I’d like to point out that almost no sensible person would pay that kind of money for something that probably won’t last 15 min.  Let’s say between the age of 16 and 26 you get some How much did each time cost you? 1 time 		$23,000 5 times		$4,600 10 times	$2,300 25 times	$920 50 times	$460 100 times 	$230 500 times 	$46  For those who were able to get Poontang 500 times over those 10 years (that’s at least once a week for 10 years).  I think we can all agree that they got a good return on their money.  For the rest of us (99%) we should have invested in something else.  If you only got laid 5 times over the last 10 years was it worth $4,600 each one of those times.    My thought is the money could have been better invested in whores, strippers, and prostitutes. At $50 for a blow job and $100 for the hole.  We all could have had a lot more fun.   Let’s move on to once you say “I do”  DISCLAIMER: (Kids, do not try this at home, the stunts performed in marriage should only be done by trained professionals) Once you’re married the Poontang can be abundant.  Assuming the average guy gets some 2 times a week for first 5 years and 1 time a week for the next 35 years for a total of 2340 times in his life.  I stop there because after 60 unless you remarry who wants to get naked with that saggy wrinkled mess.  Now don’t get me wrong she can take out her dentures and give me a hummer 3 times a week for all I care, but don’t expect me to be returning the favor.  So what is the cost over a lifetime because of our quest for Poontang?  Its hard to know.  On average we get laid 2,340 times in our life but at what price?    We guys have sacrificed so much in our conquest for Poontang  Money, respect, time hanging out with the guys, hours and hours of our precious TV watching time, and for what? But don’t give in my brothers, for our time is at hand, go forth in conquest of poontang but always remember.   They may take our cum all over their face, but they’ll never take our Freedom!!!!    This blog is dedicated to those who have fallen prey to marriage in their quest for poontang.  Good luck fellows, although we never get to see you anymore you will always be in our memories.       Later this week we will discuss Balls, why two small ones instead of one big one.

      Well my first guess would be the fact that I’m right handed and spent many a lonely night. (I didn’t know any sluts)  But is that the only reason?  Was it my own doing or was I destined to have a right angle in my dangle?  There could have been lots of things that contributed to the angle.  Perhaps I slept on my right side more often growing up, maybe I should have worn briefs instead of boxers, or perhaps if I would have known more sluts or would have had more money for the whores my angle could have been prevented.    You know I could be all wrong about this.  Maybe it’s not just me, what if every guy is in the same predicament.  If so, is there a preference girls like.  Do some girls like it to the left and some sluts like it to the right? When I’m on a first date and the girl says tell me about your self should I tell her, does she want to know?  Or does she already assume that because I’m right handed I have a right angle in my dangle.    I should ask some of my left handed friends and see if they have left angles in their dangles.  That could possible solve this mystery.  But how do you ask another guy about the angle of his dangle?  That’s why I started this BLOG.  It’s a nonjudgmental place where guys can come together and discus the angle of their dangle.    Well for now I’m going to try to fix the problem the only way I know how…..Using Lefty  Remember kids if you don’t want this to happen to you stay in school and meet the slutty girls early!   Later this week I will discuss  “2 in the pink 1 in the stink” and why girls love it so much.    Until then remember alcohol is our friend only if we use it in excess

      Growing up as guys we have all played in the mud. My brother Brent and I rode our bikes in the mud, rode our 4-wheelers in the mud, and threw mud at the losers in the poor neighborhood down the rode. Little did we know that we might have been playing in shit?    Several years ago, after throwing mud at the homeless for most of the day, we headed home. My brother brought up that although he loved throwing mud at less fortunate people, the smell of mud was quiet unpleasant.  After thinking about it we agreed that wet dirt (or mud) smells like shit.  Now not all dirt smells I know, but everyone can admit to being around mud sometime and it smelling like shit.  We then started to think to ourselves why?  After much deliberation we came up with our Dinosaur Shit Theory.   We believe that dirt is partly made up of Dinosaur shit.  Our theory is not without proof and although you may be skeptics now after you read our theory you too will believe.  First off why else would mud smell like shit? Let’s look at the similarities. To start dry dirt, it doesn’t smell.  Dry shit (dog poop), it doesn’t smell.  But wet dirt (mud) smells like shit most of the times. Wet dog poop, it smells like shit most of the time. Coincidence?  Maybe, but I think not.         Second mud in the mountains does not smell like shit.  Why? Because of erosion.  All the dirt that has dinosaur shit in it has washed away millions of years ago. If you go to the ocean what color is the dirt? Brown or some might say a shit like color.  Also if you go deep into the bottom of the ocean it’s just a filthy sludge mess down there on the ocean floor.  What do you think that is?  It’s the run off of millions of years of dinosaur shit.  Look at the bottom of your local lake.  It’s just the same shit.  Third part of our theory is just doing the math.    We propose that 1 Dinosaur produces a pile of shit that covers a 10ft by 10ft area 1ft in depth every week. 1 Dinosaur poops 10ft by10ft once a week this equals 100 sq ft a week and           5,200 sq ft a year, but we have to figure there were 10 million dinosaurs so 52,000,000,000 sq ft of poop for 10 million dinosaurs per year, and they lived 10 million years so 520,000,000,000,000,000 sq ft of poop over those 10 million years.  The United States is roughly 3,000 miles wide and 1,000 miles tall.  Together that is 3,000,000 sq miles in USA.  There are 5,200 feet in a mile. There are 27,040,000 sq ft in a square mile. So, 27,040,000 sq ft in a mile 3,000,000 sq miles in USA 81,120,000,000,000 sq ft in the USA  Now its just math.   Divide all the dinosaur poop 520,000,000,000,000,000 sq ft of poop over 10 million years By all the land in the United States 81,120,000,000,000 sq ft in the USA And you get 6,410 ft That is how many feet of shit would cover the entire United States if all the dinosaur poop were piled up.      That’s a big smelly mess But of course not all 6,410 ft of that would survive all these years.  Lets say that 75% of the dinosaur poop biodegraded and is gone forever.  That still leaves 1,602 ft of poop covering an area the size of the USA.  That’s 150ft taller than the Empire States Building.  My point is that there is a lot of poop unaccounted for.  It has mixed with the soil and is part of the ground we walk on.    And that is our Dinosaur Shit Theory  Whether or not you believe in our Dinosaur Shit Theory is up to you.   But I hope next time it rains and your around some smelly mud you will at least keep our theory in mind.

      It’s not a bad life.  You wake up, go eat something, watch some TV, maybe call a friend, eat something else, more TV, then you go to bed.  There’s not a lot of excitement involved so you‘ve got to take what you can get, but the benefits can be great.   The key to being a loafer is not setting the bar to high.  I learned a lot from a friend of mine Matt.   He graduated in May 03’ and proceeded to go 10 months without a job.  After 4-5 months of doing nothing he set a weekly goal to send out 1 resume a day Monday thru Thursday. Because as a loafer you always get a 3 day weekend.  I am sad to report that Matt gave in 3 months ago do to pressure from above, no not god, his Mom.  He has left the loafer life behind to join respectable society.  Although it is sad to see him go, we salute him in his 10-month run and we await the day we can welcome him back.(and he will be back)   I too am currently a loafer.  Not long ago I gave into the man and got a job.  Although it was nice to have money after 4 months I’m back.  Hi diddle de de, it’s the loafer life for me.  I’m 2 months in and lovin every minute of it.  I strongly suggest everyone try the loafer life style at least once in his or her lives.  Sometimes it’s hard but the rewards can be great.  A few things to remember, first there will be pressure for you to stop loafing.  The key is to appear busy and act like your trying while really doing nothing.  Second you will need to be partially funded to survive in your loafer paradise.   Top 4 people to turn to:    1. Parent (kids go to school and loaf away, why go to classes when you can sit on your ass) 2. Girlfriends (be really nice and Mooch, Mooch, Mooch) 3. Roommate (Borrow, borrow, and borrow some more, then steal something of his, pawn it, and use the money to pay him back)   4. Grandparents (There old,they'll believe anything, if your in school tell them you need $$$ for text books, if not in school tell them your car is out of Blinker fluid and you can’t afford it with all your bills) With these tools you too can join the luxurious life of a loafer.    Later this month why homeless people smell like cabbage.

      There’s a product out on the market called “Pimp Juice”.  Perhaps you’ve heard of it.  It’s an energy drink (the equevalent to Red Bull) but its marketed to the Pimp inside us all.  Being the adventurious type I tried it and was supprised by the results.  Within 3 minutes of drinking Pimp Juice had the earge to start slappin bitches and choken ho’s!!!                   Is Chip gonna have to choke a ho?  I wanted to get in a low-rider pimp-moble and cruize around pickin up my money from my ho’s.  After 2 hours of this strange feeling and relizing I wasn’t black, I finally returned to my normal self.   The reason I write this article is one of concern.  It is my belief that Pimp Juice should not be used by minors.  We have to be 21 to purchase beer and 18 to purchase cigerrettes, no minor should be allowed near this stuff.  Once your 18 you can make that decision if that’s the road you want to go down.    I don’t want my kids coming home and me asking them what did you do today?  And they repond “Well dad, we went pimping, and Billy choked a Ho for not earning enough on the playground today”    That’s not the life I want for my kids!! If you agree register and sign our patition at www.don’t-choke-a-ho-billy.com  We will not stand idly by while our kids a currupted.  Next week:  Why using a slip-n-slide may cause your daughter to grow up to be a slut. Can’t wait that long check us out at www.slip-n-slide-slut.com

      As a good christian lad there are certain things I would never do.  But recently a friend of mine’s girlfriend presented a moral delima.  She believes that she should not stay the night over at his place for religious reasons. (even though nothing sexual is happening)  But on many occasions she has taken naps there, as well as slept over until 2 a.m. (heaven forbid) before she was taken home to meet her religious requirements.  Some christians and I believe that taking naps with the door closed, (oh lord please forgive them), and staying over till 2 a.m. would qualify her as a slut and damnation straight to hell. But nothing sexual is happening they say(and yes we do believe them)  So if she is staying over until 2 a.m. and taking frequent naps with the door shut (oh mercy) and nothing sexual is happening. Well so some might say that qualifies her as a tease.   So which is it?   A Slut…..or a Tease? Cast your vote now, we would love to hear from you.  Only 99 cents per vote. Must be 18 years or older.    Later this week: When a friend chooses a poontangless relationship over you!!!

      On Memorial Day, I along with my significant other and a friend went to Six Flags.  Half way through the day we all got hungry so we decided to get something to eat.  My friend suggested a particular food stand that sold corndogs.  We all ordered the corndog basket, which included fries.  Thinking I had nothing to fear from a corndog I waited for my food.  As the guy behind the counter handed us our food I saw something was seriously wrong.  They had just handed us the most dreaded food know to man “The Foot-Long Corndog”.  The foot-long corndog has ruined more relationships, ended more marriages, and intimidated more men than any other food out there, and I was staring at three of them.  What did I do you ask?  I did the only thing you can in that situation.  I broke mine in half.      Why did someone have to invent the foot long hotdog?  Don’t us guys have enough problems as it is?  Don’t get me wrong I’m not lacking in any way south of the border but come on!!  We guys have enough problems to worry about already.  When you’re at a baseball game, the fair, or Six Flags and you go to get something to eat; you don’t want to be looking over your shoulder, wondering if the next food stand has Foot-long hotdogs.    When you do go get something to eat and you see that foot-long hotdog do you find yourself looking on with envy?  Do you silently stare and wonder what if?        I mean damn, a foot long, a whole 12 inches, what would I do with that…. Top 5 answers 1.  Go into porn and be know as “Kickstand” 2.  Wear a Speedo everywhere 3.  Legally change name to Pete “The Meat” Johnson 4.  Rock her world 5.  2 in the pink, my foot long in a slut

      On Memorial Day I went to Six Flags with my significant other and my friend James.  After several hours of riding rides and wandering around we decided to go.  But before we went I wanted to win one of those big stuffed animals for my dog. (So he could have something else to hump)  Well, we go up to one game where you have a gun and you shoot a ball at 3 cups, if you knock them all off  the stand in one shot you win a stuffed animal.  James looks at this game and says, “I can do that, its simple” so I gave him $2 to try to win my dog a new humping toy.  Now you need to realize that from the gun to the 3 cups is less than 3 feet. James aims, shoots, and missed by at least a foot.  We are all shocked at his inability to hit even one cup.  So I try it, although I did not win I did at least hit 2 cups.  Upset at our inability to win a simple prize we stumble upon another game.  This game you throw a softball at three square blocks (each is about 2 inches squared) stacked on top of each other.  The object is to knock all 3 off in 1 throw.  For $5 you get 3 chances.  I decided to let James have another try at it.  Because we all know he is Mr. Baseball. Not 24 hours before he was bragging how good his curveball was these days.  So again the blocks are less than 4 feet away.  James steps up to the plate, winds back and throws.  He missed.  He throws again, he misses again, last ball, he throws, and again he misses.  1, 2, 3, you’re out.    James, (Mr. Baseball) has a softball and couldn’t hit something less than 4 feet away.  Maybe next time I’ll ask my three year old cousin for help when I want to get my dog a new toy to hump!!!  James not to make you feel bad, but that was the most embarrassed I have ever been in my entire life and my mom found my porn stash in High school so I know what embarrassment is.
