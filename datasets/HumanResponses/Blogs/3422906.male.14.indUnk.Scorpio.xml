      Today i found out that i have a 74 avg. in reading and i wasn't that thrilled to hear it. I have that avg. because she said i haven't turned in alot of stuff but the only way that could have happened is if she changed her mind about what we were supposed to do and i didn't get the memo saying she did change it so i am kinda mad and sad at the same time cuz i don't know what my mom is gonna say about it and whether or not i can go on a trip with the church because of it so yall be praying for me about that and i hope it'll all work out the way GOD plans it to work out..!! but i'm outa here so bye!!

      Today we had these two test that i was scared of cuz i thought i didn't know ne of the stuff on them but i actually i knew everything on all them. So i was happy and then i stayed i computer discovery all day so i could play computer games non-stop cuz it is fun..but enough of my stupid childish thoughts of video games. Then i got off the internet and was talking to people and we were looking up pictures of cartoon shows and some of the shows must be different in japan cuz there was some nasty things on there that aren't cool one bit like *s*e*x* (not cool until you are married and even nastier to watch) so we got out of that website and the bell rang and we left so that has been mostly my day for today but i'll write back in here lata so bye...!!

      Yeah you know that problem i have about likin to many girls at once. Well i found out what is wrong with me..i have to big of a heart and i need to give away all this love i have in my heart and i guess i think i can do that by havin a girlfriend but i realized that i don't need a girlfriend to do that (but hey don't get me wrong having a girlfriend is the best in the world especially when you love them alot) all i need to do is trust in the lord and give my full attention to him and not to girls cuz really what good is a girl gonna do me in heaven when all marriages and relationships are void cuz the only relationship there is is the one with u and GOD, but i still have my eye set on someone but it is a totally different girl than the ones i have been talking about (i don't like them ne more) but i guess i am outa here cya lata. i'll write back in soon.

      Well there is this girl i really, really like but i don't even know if she knows i like her or worse yet she likes me. I know she has a guy but she was supposed to break up wit him friday but she didn't cuz she wasn't at school. So i am kinda hung in the balance because she wasn't at school. Then i like this other girl that i don't even know if she likes me and i just wish she would stop and take a look around because i have always liked her eversince we became really close friends and she knows i like her but she never really gave a thought to us as being G and B friends but i guess that is enough writing for one day so i'll just write another time. CYA lata.

So brandon, jonci, shelby, and i went some where and started talking about stupid stuff and shelby just showed how stupid she really is because she didn't know a single about what we were talking aobut and she was tryin to act like she did. Then we noticed everyone had gone and her mom was looking for her and when she finally found us she was mad, and she gave me the evil eye like i had been doing sumthing with her daughter and i was scared to be truthful with ya cuz she looked like she was going to rip my head off. Then we went to go get jonci's, and shelby's purse and they found out that their moms had been calling them forever, so yeah they got n trouble but oh well. I'll talk to yall lata luv ya all.

      This song helps me realize i can't be mad, sad, down, or ne thing that makes you feel bad because it has to do with other people's choices and how it isn't always about me and how much i just want to be your boyfriend. This song tells me to wait until your ready so hear it goes...  Better For You .:.  My decision can not be put off again I see the right choice but my heart is filled with dread It all seems backwards in my head, my head  I know it seems too wrong to be right This way is so much harder to fight But in the end I know it is true This way is better, it's better for you  Choose a little pain and gain a life with joy Accepting pleasure now will earn a life of pain It all seems backwards in my head, my head  I know it seems too wrong to be right This way is so much harder to fight But in the end I know it is true This way is better It's better for you, for you  Sometimes I wonder why it's this way When it's done the burden is gone This discomfort will be taken away As soon as it's over, it's over for me  I know it seems too wrong to be right This way is so much harder to fight But in the end I know it is true This way is better It's better for you, for you

      .:. Why We're Kutless .:.  We wanted our name to represent the impact of what Christ did for us on the cross. Christ took our beating and paid the wages of our sin (Romans 6:23).   He took our cuts for us, leaving us "Kutless."  I'm glad you came and did all this and i know i haven't thanked you lately for this so i am thanking you in front of everyone in the whole world, to show you how much i love you and how much you have impacted my life. Because you changed a poor confused boy to a smart, wealthy (in your love), loved, and happy 14 year old who does things he isn't happy about and he just wants to say sorry and i'm glad you sent your son to save us. Thank You God, i love you more than ne one or ne thing in this whole universe.  All The Words .:.  How do I speak of the indescribable to You I will try to explain these feelings that are true So looking to the sky I will sing and from my heart to You I bring  All of the words in all of my life that could never explain and never describe All of my love, which is nothing to hide so I lift up my hands and I worship I worship You  In your presence I forever choose to live I will praise You for it's all I have to give So looking to the sky I will sing and from my heart to You I bring  All of the words in all of my life that could never explain and never describe All of my love, which is nothing to hide so I lift up my hands and I worship  By Your grace You let me come talk to You It's not that I'm worthy I thank you Jesus For the love that You have shown  All of the words in all of my life that could never explain and never describe All of my love, which is nothing to hide so I lift up my hands and I worship  With all of the words in all of my life that could never explain and never describe All of my love, which is nothing to hide so I lift up my hands and I worship I worship You

      Today i helped out Robert on moving some bricks for his landscaping he is doing at his new house, lovely house in clinton, and in the process of moving the bricks it started to sprinkle and little bit than it started to rain cats and dogs. Man we got soaked. So we got back to his house and unloaded it all out of the trailer that he borrowed from mr. duck, which bye the way took like 30 mins to even get permission to get it cuz mr. duck has a story for every thing. But last night was kinda awkward cuz everyone was asking me were was Shelby and i told them she was probaly at home doing something and they were like taking the wrong way like saying that she doesn't like our youth group or she doesn't like me ne more and i just flat out told them she had company over and she didn't want to burden them with taking them to church alright, so they backed off after then. Oh yeah, it was awkward cuz i still missed Shelby and i was with all the people that were there on tour and she wasn't there so it was kinda weird but we talked a long time after church on the phone so i guess it was better than actually seeing her at church. Well i am outa words to say so i'll write lata in here bye. Luv ya lil sis, and I love you Shelby, and Lauren T.

      Well nothing has changed from yesterday, meaning i can't stop thinking about shelby and how much i miss her and love her. Like i went over to my friends house to play basketball and i got my butt beat badly because i couldn't focus on the game because i miss shelby so much. I am miserable because shelby is just so wonderful and we just have so much in common i can't seem to stop thinking about her. She is the only person since my first true love that i have felt so passionately about and i don't want to lose her even if that means we have to be friends for a lil while..but enough of my love adventures i'll write back in here later on this week maybe tomorrow or..who knows when but i will i promise.

      Well i'm back from my Mission Tour trip with my church and i have got me a girl who is just so dear to me and i just don't want to let her go and i can't just seem to keep out of my head cuz she is just beautiful and kind and all of the things i look for in a girl. We started to talk on the trip and we started dating but we broke up sunday cuz we didn't know each other well enough to actually go out so agreed to get to know each other before we started to go back out, I admit it was hard but i am a gentleman and i will do what a woman askes me to do and she wanted to take a break so i did but it hurt me so bad i almost broke down and cried but i kept my head up and faught back the tears. On the trip i had so much fun, we went so many places to help out at homeless shelters and went to the Louisville Bats game even though they lost we still had fun, we just had so much fun you couldn't even imagin all the fun you could have on a mission trip,it just felt so good helping out people who are in need of help. Well i have run out of words to say about this..I LOVE YOU SHELBY..i'll write in here later about all this stuff too..!!

      Oh it was so awesome.  We had so much fun doing the most stupid stuff like freezing Alex Duncan's underwear and then giving it back to him frozen.  Then he thought he would get us back and he sprayed Jordan Harris' sleeping bag which Jordan wasn't in on it so he got mad and froze Alex's toothbrush along with Logan's because he didn't know whose toothbrush was whose so he just did both.  My mom went and embarrassed me so badly.  She told every single girl of all the stuff i did as a child and how stupid i was and everything and they were dogging me about it.  Oh man i just can't stop saying stuff about it just ask me about sometime ok and i'll tell you all you need to know but i got to go luv yall bye.

      Well all yall know i am going on Supper Summer for a week at MC. It is a leadership camp, in case you were wonderin, but before i can go i have to say i'm sorry for something. Shelby i am sorry for saying all i said about you being a butthole and everything, you just have to understand i was so mad at you i just couldn't control what i was sayin, what i was doing, or what i was feeling so it just flowed into harsh words. Now if you don't want to forgive me for that i can understand but i just want you to know you are a really good friend and i hope i didn't lose you as one. I also got to tell yall another thing that there is this band called sevenplaces and they have an awesome reason why they are called that and it is because Jesus bled from Sevenplaces the first from his head and that blood cleanses us from all thought that is unholy and unclean, the next is his back and that blood heals you from all the peolple who have hurt you from turning there back on you, the next is his side and that blood cleanses you from all the hurting inside you and letting you know that he will never leave your side, the next is his 2 hands that blood cleanses what you have done with those hands that might be unholy, the next is his 2 feet and that blood cleanses you from the places that you might have gone that were unholy and that is it and it is just so wonderful to know that each place he bled from has a purpose and that Jesus is always there to help you and cleanse you from evil. Well i Wuv yall and i'll right bak in here after i get back from supper summer. buh-bye

Well we had bottle rocket wars and i got popped in the nuts and i popped logan in the chest like 3 times and zach, we played with the thortons up street from logan, got hit in the face and brad got hit in the butt. Then we went inside and played X-Box for like 3 or 4 hours each day and drove the thorton's mom crazy cuz we were screamin at each other and yellin and she was tryin to sleep so it didn't really work out. Then i found out my mom is not coming home from vacation for until tuesday which i will be at Supper Summer when she was supposed to come home tomorrow. So now i won't see her until Friday night and i miss my mama and me being a mama's boy doesn't really help either so i am kinda sad :( Well i guess i am outa words to say bye.

      I messed up with this girl I dated, I took somethings she did the wrong way and said something about the way I took it and she got mad at me and we lost that spark for each other.  We made up a lil after it happened and now we started talking more but I can't stand the thought of not being able to date her ne more because I know what I did had consquences that can not be changed for some reasons.  I just love her so much I can't stop thinking about her all the songs I love remind me of her, all the things I do remind me of her I can't stop thinking about her and I wish, I just wish I had of known what was really going on when I did those things.  So now because I did those things she is dating someone else it just hurts to see her dating him knowing I coulda been that person and not him.  But I guess she isn't the one the lord had planned for me to date at that time so I guess I'll just do what I always do cuz "Life is a Garden, DIG IT" but i'm gone yall bye.
