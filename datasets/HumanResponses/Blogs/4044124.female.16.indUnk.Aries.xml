       So....    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We (my mother and myself) went to this little thing at "church", hosted by my grandmother to which I brought my beast (Rocky). It was a themed thing and two others had brought their "dogs" as well. Basically we just sat and talked and little people (the children) messed around with the doggies...and then...Skila (my little cousin) begins to cry...because she doesn't want me or my beast to be there. So my mother and I eventually left mainly because of this. By the time we arrived to our vehicle my mother was crying because basically our own family had just pushed us out of yet another gathering...that and my great aunt is mad at her for some unknown reason and&nbsp; she is growing tired of everyone rejecting us...for whatever reason.

       Here we go again...    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose I am starting over with this...since I deleted the last one I had...I just didn't need anyone else to read what I had written. I suppose it was a bit personal. I would like to say I will refrain from such this time...but I'm making no promises since I never meant for the last one to get so...deep. I guess I get carried away sometimes. I would also do the whole,"I don't know why I am doing this since there is no one who will actually read it." but I thought that last time too and apparently I was wrong since people did read it and then they cried and then they made other people cry and on and on...but as I said I am going to try to keep this from getting that personal and deep so no one can really see from the words here the...torment of sorts that goes on inside me. Most internal injuries cannot heal alone. Thankfully, I have finally found someone who is helping me in that...helping alot, in fact. Simply knowing that someone as wonderful and caring as he is exists is doing wonderful things for my state of being (no I am not speaking of any kind of God...If you don't know who I am talking about then perhaps you should stay tuned because I am sure he will come up alot and eventually you will understand). I am still the same in some sense, but through him I am finding something absolutely amazing within me. I love him more than I ever thought possible....and now I am done babbling about that...for a while at least.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, if you were among those who read bits of my former "blog" then I suppose I will let you know that alot of things have changed (even though I only took it down a month? ago). My mom is learning to tell people to kiss her ass after all these...32 years and is working on figuring things out in all aspects of her life. She is a much happier person in general now. Jon...yeah, I still hate him with everything within me, but I am trying to forgive him for alot of things...trying. I haven't even so much as talked to Ryan on IM in atleast a month. I am realizing more and more that what I had with him wasn't what I wanted to make myself believe it was. On July 8th, 2004 I met the person who is changing my life for the&nbsp;better in extreme ways (Yes...I know this was only 18 days ago, but I actually don't feel like I walking blindly into it this time...and I understand if you don't undertand that...I didn't understand it for a while myself, but the difference I feel with him is incredible.) as far as the whole church thing goes...I am working on that too. I haven't been in a long time. It's not something that's easy to figure out, and I am not willing to say that I will figure it out any time soon...I simply don't think I am strong enough to have so much faith in something that has been shoved down my throat with such force that it has choked out alot of truths that I have needed for so long. I honestly hope that eventually I grow enough to gain the strength to have so much faith in something like that.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit of a bad thing that I can already see this getting as bad as the last one, but as I said, I am getting better about alot of things. So, perhaps this can be filled with fewer painful things.We will see I suppose. I will try to stop myself in order to keep it under control...but sometimes I don't realize the way my thoughts will effect (affect? ack...I always get them confused) others.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose I am done for now. I realize that this wasn't exactlly the hourly updated "I went to Wal-Mart with my mom." kind of thing that most people have...if you read any of my last you will probably remember a few entries that were like that...or that started out like that and ended up on a totally different note...one similar to the tone of this one.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ThE EnD
