      this morning i woke up and it looks like hell hath broken loose in my house. i've been doing the Ebay thing for a couple months now and it  is  helping to pay some of the bills, although i've been lazy in listing anything new lately. up until today. we went to a huge community yard sale this past weekend and i found the most amazing Elmo toys! one that tells you to toss it and when you do it goes "wheeeeee"! and then the other one tells you that you're his sweetheart....i may end up keeping that one..lol. and a very cute Elmo-face purse that some little girl is just gonna love having. all i've gotta do is take pics and get them developed. the only drawback to having this Ebay thing in full throttle is the fact that my house looks like Goodwill on a Tuesday morning!! there is stuff EVERYWHERE!!! baby shoes, clothes, toys, books..you name it. i clean (totally clean, to the point of exhaustion) at least once a week. but in  a matter of only one day, its back to it's original chaotic ruin. the really scary thing is--where once upon a time it would piss me off to no end to have so much clutter, i'm finding that i really don't mind it much. the fact that i'm a Virgo saying this makes me shudder..... i've found that if i keep my favorite room in the house spotless (the kitchen) i'm perfectly content to let the other areas go. well, of course..with the exception of the bathroom.  THAT  room has no business being a mess..that's just nasty. I've also been continuing in learning the definitions to new words that my very dear friend and i started a few months ago. i think today's word is 'dichotomy'.  i think it has something to do with being totally opposite. but i'll get the definition and post it in here so i don't forget. something like a messy Virgo. two completely opposite things..yet, i'm finding that it's becoming my reality. ebay has been the catalyst of my undoing..lol.

      there's nothing in the world better than having a place to throw your thoughts down. it makes room for other things that are waiting for their turn in your head. this is going to be a form of release. two nights ago i saw a meteorite. it shot across the sky in just a matter of a second or two, but the image is still lingering in my mind. there's something peaceful yet humbling in seeing something like that. it makes me feel small...limited. while camping in a very beautiful part of SE Ohio,  on a dock that has a virtually limitless view of the sky, my partner was fishing. i laid down on the dock and just stared at the sky not saying a word. as Leo and Virgo continued their eternal chase, out of the corner of my eye, i saw it. the light made me gasp and say very loudly, "did you see it??"  just a brief glimmer, but very bright. it wasn't long before she was laying beside me, fishing abandoned, and we were gazing into a sky that continued to light up. one meteorite left a trail in the sky that lingered for a few seconds and it was followed by less spectacular ones that still made us catch our breath and giggle like kids. the whole time we were there, i was torn between feeling completely content in my surroundings and the troubling thoughts of Kyle leaving for the Marines. it's weird to feel relaxed in a way and at the same time depressed. i'll leave a dream or two that i've been having related to that. this is it for now...
