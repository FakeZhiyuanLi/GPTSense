      I have been searching High and Low for a place in North NJ that allows dogs that doesnt cost 8 jabillion dollars/month. But that is a bunch of hoo haa. Morris county what a bunch of flim flam. I dont get what people have against dogs. I mean if you charge a pet deposit and a monthly fee...how do you lose out. Plus they can put breed restrictions so there are no vicuious dogs in there complex. I guess its one of those mysteries in life...like how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop. Pretty much the only places your gonna find in morris county that allow pets are gonna start off at 1500.00/month for a tiny 600 square foot apt. My solution is make a few decently priced complexes that allow dogs in the general Morris County area that have a decent price starting at 800.00 give or take for a 1bedroom that allows dogs. Plus they need to stop making all these small apartments up there. I live in central NJ in a 1 bedroom right now that is 900 sqft. Which is a good size for a one bedroom. Plus I am paying a good price for it. But I am a North Jerzy boy and I belong up there.  Whatever happened to buying a starter home or a fixer upper? I will tell you..they want to charge 300,000+. I dont know anyone who would pay that much for a junker, but I guess there are people out there. I mean come on...Townhomes going for 400k +. Its a funny shaped house attached to others just like it. No yard, high maintence fee's. Gee where do I sign up.  Even in the so called bad areas of NJ you are still gonna spend a pretty penny renting or buying a place.  Dont get me wrong I love North NJ and am trying to get back there, but this whole starter houses and fixer uppers going for 300k + has got to stop. Its a piece of Junk house that your prolly gonna need to drop agleast 100k+ into. I have looked at many different websites and the quote on quote fixer uppers, your better off buying a piece of land(if you can locate a decently priced lot) and get your self a nice shed while you have a house custom built. That is the cheapest way to do it.  Ohh and back to the whole townhouse issue. The majority of townhouses and some of these houses built in developments are very poorly constructed and people are line up around the block to buy one. What are people comming to now a days. I wish I had that much money to through away on some of these townhomes that start falling apart within 5 year. This is a whole other issue I dont understand. The companies are wasting all this wood, and truthfully its not all there fault. I mean these developments are in such High demand that the people who make them want to get them up as quickly as possible to meet demand. I appluad the people who constuct these places. I mean people are willing to pay through the roof for a poor to decent contructed place....and contrcution companies were smart enough to figure that one out. But not saying all do bad work, just some.  I have read many differnt posts on diffent websites, some refering to people like me who arent rich and want better priced places, saying they dont want these poor people in there town. Well guess what I am poor and damn proud of it. I work a full time job as does my wife and we do ok. But it would be nicer if rent was cheaper. Not everyone has rich mommy and daddies or not everyone marries into a rich family. I am a decent person. Have a good backround, but I am still in the begining of the "real world" I am 25, and seeing as how the economy was bad for a while that made it hard for me to find a job in my field. So lay off us rich folk theres more poor to average income people than you. Just remember rich folk when you need something fixed like your computer or your pipes just remeber your not doing it yourself.
