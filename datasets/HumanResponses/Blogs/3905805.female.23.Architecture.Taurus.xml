      Say, if you’ve never gone to Stop and Shop and bought food for the apartment but still manage to come home everyday and make yourself lunch and dinner, wouldn't you say to yourself, "hmmm...wonder where all&nbsp;this food came from?"&nbsp; Or maybe when you saw the 12 page receipt that I posted on the front of the refrigerator so you would know where all the food came from, you would see it and say, "wow, my roommates spent a lot of money on food, maybe I should chip in."&nbsp; Or maybe, just maybe, when you saw that I took it upon myself to write&nbsp;my name on everything I purchased so you would know who paid for it and who it belonged to, you would think, "maybe I shouldn't eat this because it doesn't have my name on it and my mother taught me when I was 5 not to touch things that have other people's names on them."  &nbsp;  Or if you've never purchased toilet paper, but still continue to wipe your ass every time you go to the bathroom, wouldn't you think, "hmmm...wonder where the toilet paper came from?"  And if that toilet paper happened to I don't know, say, run out, wouldn't you think to go buy a new package instead of using up all the tissues instead?&nbsp; And when *gasp* magically somehow a new package of toilet paper appeared, that you AGAIN did not buy, wouldn't you think to at least think to put the toilet paper on the roll instead of leaving it sitting on the edge of the sink?  &nbsp;  Or how about if you see that the garbage is full, wouldn't you think to yourself before shoving even more garbage into it, "Hey, I use the garbage just as much as everyone else in this house, it looks pretty full,&nbsp;maybe I should tie it up, take it downstairs and put it in the trash can?"&nbsp; Or after you've&nbsp;polished off a six&nbsp;pack of beer wouldn't you think, "Hey, the recycling is overflowing, those must be my beer bottles because&nbsp;I know that one of my roommates doesn't drink beer and the other one wasn't here last night, so I should probably take those downstairs because this place is really starting to smell like a frat house."&nbsp; Or come Wednesday night, when you come home and notice that every other house on the street has put out their garbage cans and recycling bins, wouldn't you think, "Oh yeah!&nbsp; It's garbage day tomorrow, better go get the garbage/recycling and put it out right now that way I don't forget after I've polished off a 6 pack of beer."  &nbsp;  Or how about if you're about to go to bed and you notice (or maybe not) that there is a light still on in the living room, which just happens to be adjacent to your bedroom, and in fact, you have to walk through the living room in order to get to your bedroom, wouldn't you, I don’t know…turn it off??&nbsp; Or if when the electric bill comes and it's a little more than expected and the rest of your roommates are all standing around trying to figure out why, and you come stumbling out of your room with a blast of artic chill spilling out behind you like I just opened up the freezer door, wouldn't you chime in with, "Hey guys, I installed an air conditioner in my bedroom and leave it running constantly all day, even when I'm not here, maybe that could be the difference?"  &nbsp;  But no, no...you don't notice.  Instead you fix yourself a pasta salad with the ziti, onions, red and orange peppers, garlic, salt and pepper and salad dressing I bought last Thursday.  Instead of fixing a salad with your own food, you decide to open up a new bottle of salad dressing with my RED BOLDFACED name on it, because the other bottle was empty from making pasta salad.  Instead of running out and buying a new package of toilet paper when your tummy is rumbly, you decide to use up all the tissues in the open box on the back of the toilet and then when those run out, use the other unopened box (which I bought) from under the sink because there was no toilet paper left and you really had to go number two because the pasta salad you just ate went through you faster than a locomotive.  Instead of taking out the garbage, you empty the rest of that pasta salad into the already full bag, shoving it down with your foot like the Rubbermaid plastic bin is suddenly going to grow another 6 inches so your shit will fit in.  Instead of going out and buying food because you're still hungry, you open the fridge, stand in front of it with your hand on your hip, peering intently like there is actually anything in there that you purchased,&nbsp;and wonder what else you could eat because the pasta salad you had before didn't exactly curb your appetite.  Instead of noticing that the fridge is full of food&nbsp;that isn't yours, you grab a couple Rally Cap Ales to settle that stomach.  And instead of taking out the already full of all your others beers recycling bin, you down those Rally Caps and set them down next to it and then retreat off to your air conditioned ice palace.  &nbsp;  Hey roomie, since you're obviously not getting all my subtle references, maybe I should be the one to get a clue and post this on a big fat placard and&nbsp;stick&nbsp;it in the front yard like the "Save Our Lady of the Peach Church" signs I see everywhere around out neighborhood:  &nbsp;  1. "PLEASE STOP EATING MY FOOD OR AT LEAST REPLACE THE FOOD YOU DID EAT OR GIVE ME MONEY FOR THE FOOD YOU STOLE."  2. "PLEASE BE CURTEOUS AND REALIZE THAT I HAVE BOUGHT THE LAST 100 PACKAGES OF TOILET PAPER AND MAYBE IT'S YOUR TURN TO BUY SOME."  3.&nbsp;"UNLESS YOU OWN STOCK IN THE ELECTRIC COMPANY, A LA MONOPOLY, PLEASE TURN OUT THE LIGHTS AND SHUT OFF YOUR AIR CONDITIONER WHEN YOU'RE NOT HOME."  4. "PLEASE ROLL UP YOUR JCREW SLEEVES AND TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE AND/OR RECYCLING FOR ONCE IN YOUR SPOILED LIFE."  &nbsp;  Sincerely,  Your broke, hungry, dirty, sweat stained roomie.

      So, I needed to calm down after the crazy week I had and I did so by spending waaaay too much money this weekend.&nbsp; What can I say, I live like 10 minutes from Newbury Street and Niketown was having a sale...and I just sounded like a really big snot. But, it's all good because I got my&nbsp;bonus and my raise and an unexpected tax check from the State of Massachusetts on Friday.&nbsp;  To celebrate, Lauren and I went to go&nbsp;see "A Cinderella Story" starring none other than Chad Michael Murray.&nbsp; His name in the movie is...get this...AUSTIN.&nbsp; I swear we'd be meant to be if he weren't a smoker.&nbsp; Blech.&nbsp; I'm so glad that I have a girl around now to go do girlie things with like get manicures and watch&nbsp;princess movies.&nbsp; Not that I mind living with 2 (soon to be 3) guys, it's just that I'm a girl...and well...I do girlie things like get manicures and watch princess movies. Watched the rest of the Track and Field Olympic Trials last night.&nbsp; That 18 year old girl who won the 200 was impressive.&nbsp; Too bad she's going pro instead of going to college...I'm just not down with that.&nbsp; Kids need an education, I don't care how talented they are.&nbsp; And yes, I'm allowed to call them kids when I'm at least 5 years older than them.&nbsp; Damn, I'm&nbsp;getting old.&nbsp; This weekend Lauren was like, "Wait, are you 23?"&nbsp; And I was like, "yeah, and you're&nbsp;going to be 25, HA-HA!"&nbsp; And then she said, "Yeah, well, Dave is going to be 26, he'll be in his late 20's."&nbsp; And then we both had a good laugh at his expense.&nbsp; Sorry Dave.&nbsp; Anyway, it's rainy here today and they say it's supposed to get humid as all heck the rest of the week, which should make for some lovely sleeping weather considering I don't have an air conditioner and live on the top floor of a duplex house.&nbsp; I might have to relocate to the hammock on the porch.&nbsp; It should also really help my training and make things much easier on my already heavy and out of shape lungs.&nbsp; Tangent: Maybe Chris will pick me up on the boat after work sometime this week.&nbsp; Note to self: Ask Chris to pick me up on the boat sometime after work this week. Geez, it's already 4PM??&nbsp; I need to go do some work. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      So, I seriously think that Melanie and I should go into comedy.  Either that or write a book. Melanie's best "Laurie" email of the day, "50:1 odds that her baby is curled up in the fetal position w/ its tiny fists over its ears trying to block out her voice."    I also came up with a manual for her to read.  It's called 20 WAYS TO BE MORE CONSIDERATE:  1.Stop using speakerphone to make all of your calls.    2.Stop your gab sessions at other people’s desks.  In fact, just stop them all together.  3.Stop telling me stories about your nether regions, I really don’t want or need to know how many times you went to the bathroom last night.  4.Don’t yell at people unless they’re actually at fault.  5.Use the words please and thank you.  6.Cover your mouth.    7.Get a clue when someone stops making eye contact with you that it’s time to walk away from the conversation.  8.Stop trying to exert your authority over people in office who obviously have more power than you, ie: Vice Presidents.  9.Stop walking by my desk with peach juice running down your face, telling me how good your peach is today.  It’s called a napkin, learn how to use one.  10.If I say that I’ve taken care of something, please don’t ask me 5 more times if it’s taken care of.  11.Don’t ever wear spandex pants to work again…ever.  12.Tone down your voice level…if I can hear you from my desk and you are sitting in the lunch room, you are TALKING TOO LOUD.  Inside voice…think about it.  13.Unless you are talking about the TV show, don’t ever use the word “queer”.  14.Unconsciously making up words = the loss of any and all intellectual credibility you might have had.  15.When showing clients around the showroom, please use more than just one adjective to describe our furniture.  “Wow, this chair is so comfortable…sit down, try it, isn’t it comfortable?...you’d be so surprised how comfortable it is.”  16.Don’t assume that because you told me a story about Joey once that I know or care who he is.  17.If you can wear jeans and leave at 4 everyday, then I can wear jeans and leave at 4 everyday.  Don’t remind other people about “the rules” unless you want to start by setting an example yourself.  18.Nobody cares about your “system”.  p.s. I can’t even begin to count how many p.o.s I’ve cut without telling you.  19.Stop walking around the office sighing and grunting like it’s so hard for you to carry around the extra 5 pounds you’ve gained from being pregnant.  20.Finally, and most importantly, stop being such a “moody bitch!”

      I hate work. Scratch that. I hate my boss. She's a fucking tool and thinks that the Bahamas are a state because you don't need your passport to visit them.  You don't need your passport to visit Mexico either, but that doesn't mean it's a state you fucking moron. Good thing I just got a raise and a bonus or else my ass would have been out the door.   Today reminds me of a fucking hysterical "best of craigslist":   http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/34118726.html  Thank god it's almost 5, I need to go home...sweatpants, pizza and liquor cabinet, here I come!

      Yay, my first entry! I'll admit that I feel like a big tool for actually creating a blog, but it's probably the closest thing I'll get to therapy on my current salary.  Plus, I figure it's practice for my upcoming book, currently untitled and unwritten. Today is Monday, July 12th (Chris's birthday, HAPPY BIRTHDAY KM!) and I am at work (boooo) enjoying some fresh brewed peach iced tea from Au Bon (yaaaay). Melanie and I are already super bored, it's 10:16 AM and I think we've already exchanged about 10 emails.  Doug (our president) and Chuck (our VP) are both on vacation this week and Laurie (my boss)called in sick today.  Key Office is a GHOST TOWN. To anyone who missed the party we threw this weekend, you suck and you missed a couple 2 pound lobsters, marinated steak tips and the best carrot cake this side of the Mississippi. Speaking of this weekend, I can't believe that Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery both did not qualify for the Olympics in the 100.   T minus 19 days until the Beach to Beacon and I am nowhere near ready to run 6.2 miles.  I ran for about 40 minutes yesterday but my knees started bothering me so I had to stop.  Plus, I picked up a sweet  wine  rack on the side of the road, so even if I wanted to keep running I couldn't.  Yes...I am that girl. Anyway, like I said it's Monday (boooo) but at least it's quiet at work so I can get a lot done...like, create a blog.
