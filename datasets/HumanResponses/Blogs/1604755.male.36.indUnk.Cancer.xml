      Carolyn Bly has a great book on writing called  The Passionate, Accurate Story . Bly may not be known to many people, but she's one of those writers in the literary mainstream, publishing mostly in literary magazines, who hasn't had a novel out, just a series of some of the most beautiful short stories you could have the pleasure of reading. Her advice in her writing book is timeless.  Part of the book deals with the imagination, and specifically a sense of play in the imagination. It is her observation as a creative writing instructor that students often come to her with stunted or crippled imaginations. It's difficult for her to draw such students out into the kind of "play" that results in good writing. You can learn all of the technique in the world, but without an advanced sense of play, it may go for naught.  She gives an example. A family is sitting around a dinner table the day that new neighbors have moved in next door. The father or mother asks their child, Have you met the new neighbors yet? The child says, Yes--it's a family of bears! The child's engaging in a real sense of play--a kind of enjoyment that is both intellectual and emotional. Something that's fun--in a sense, the child is telling a story. How the parents react, consistently, can affect whether the child grows up with a good or stunted imagination. If the parents respond with, That's nonsense, tell us the truth--and reinforce that lesson over and over again, then chances are the child will grow up thinking that such joyful make believe is wrong, or at best frivolous, as opposed to being central to the pursuit of a healthy imagination as adult. If, on the other hand, the parents say, That's great! How many cubs do the parent bears have? Or in some sense continue to support the imaginative impulse in the child, then they tell a story together, and the child learns the value of a good imagination. Which is its own reward, but also helps in the creative arts later on.  This sense of play is highly underrated--we are often expected to do things or say things for solely utilitarian reasons. To do so, however, undermines one of  the things that makes us human. That same sense of play, that sense of transforming the world into a place that is not just the surface we see but something underlying that surface--which begins to get at the idea that the world truly is a strange, beautiful, and complex thing--is something that makes us fully adult, fully human, and, in a sense, fully humane.  Have you ever had the sense that even though you're in your twenties or thirties or forties that you haven't fully grown up? That you're not that far removed from the child or teenager you were? The reason for this is that we're not that different. We add a veneer of adulthood, we take on responsibilities that force us to seem more adult. But at heart, we're not that different than we were back then. In a way we should be grateful, especially if we want to be creative people, because children, for all their indifference to things we adults find important, are much more likely to see the world without the myopia of cliche or the shroud of received experience. That part of being a child--of experiencing things for the first time, of not putting so much of a filter between ourselves and world--is something we should strive to keep in our daily lives. And the imagination is a big part of that.   JeffV

      A couple of people have asked me how this blog fits in with my VanderWorld Report, which is a once-a-month e-newsletter I send out to people who like my fiction. The VanderWorld Report includes music, book, and music reviews, reports on trips to conventions and other places (New Journalism-style), and updates on my writing and editing activities.  This blog, on the other hand, is reserved exclusively for thoughts, mini-essays, and observations about writing--both fiction and nonfiction. Sometimes I will stray off into observations about an editing project or about art. But other than that, this blog will be about the art of writing, in some guise. I will try to avoid subjects like marketing, PR, etc. In a sense, I'll be using this blog as a way to think certain issues through, and to share my ideas about writing.  For those of you who are not VanderWorld subscribers, just send me an email at vanderworld@hotmail.com and I'll sign you up. You get only one email per month, so it's not going to clog your email address with "spam."  Jeff V.

      When the idea for  The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric & Discredited Diseases  first came up, I had no idea that it would eventually consume my life. And yet here it is, the end of June, and I conservatively estimate that I have spent over 1,000 hours editing the Guide, proofreading the Guide, reading submissions for the Guide, and much else.  The first thing you learn about editing a fake disease guide (rather, co-editing; Mark Roberts is my co-editor--he also created this wonderful site for the Guide:  urlLink http://www.lambsheadguide.com ) is that you might as well consider yourself the editor of a  real  medical guide. It's just as much work, you're just as concerned about the veracity of the entries (although in a different sense), and the minute details of cross-referencing and copy editing for consistency are the same as well.  And yet, at the end of it all, I'm still not qualified to edit a real medical guide. In looking back over the years spent working on the Guide--literally,  years --I cannot help but wonder if it's become a form of madness. (Take for instance the frenzy involved in getting one disease translated into Spanish so we could provide an excerpt, in the original layout, of a supposed Spanish version of a related book edited by Borges. Is this sanity? Probably not.)  The tendency of many people may be to dismiss the Guide as a gimmick, and yet Mark and I have been careful to reject those submissions that seemed gimmicky. In a sense, some of those potential contributors who did not take the humorous aspect  seriously  found themselves left out in the cold. We don't have a series of "civilization is a disease" or "death is a disease" jokes in this book. We have some entries that make fun of medical jargon, or of doctors, or of hospitals. But we don't have entries that function as jokes first and disease entries second. The result has been a much richer blend of material than anyone expected at the beginning of the project. Of course, with this richness has come a complexity that demands attention to detail. Thus the apparatus of forewords, introductions, examples from prior editions of the guide, an obscure history of the 20th century from the viewpoint of the guide--all of this grows up around the entries, like some oddly beneficial application of barnacles to a ship's hull. Before you know it, it all looks very natural and organic indeed.  The interesting thing about the Guide—the idea of it and the sampler that we’ve already published in advance of the Guide itself—is how  therapeutic  it seems to be. People who are ill have found the humor in it to be very life-affirming for them. Doctors have found it to be stress-relieving—in fact, a couple of medical schools may add the book to their curriculum for stress-relief courses. (I think it was Angela Carter, the brilliant English novelist and short story writer, who said that one way to cheat death was to laugh at it, to belittle it. She said this while she was dying of lung cancer.) We’ve also been sensitive to the fact that, on one level, there’s nothing funny about disease. Several of the entries in the Guide are very serious.  I'm thinking about the Guide because I'm living it right now, but also because the preproduction phase will end soon. If not by July 1st, then shortly thereafter. My engagement with the Guide will become different than it has been. The words themselves have been forever ruined by the repeated reading, re-reading, and re-reading again--the sheer repetition of the reading has transformed the words in the entries into another language. Or made the combinations of words unintelligible to me. You could read one of the entries and it would sound like the numbers from the New York Stock Exchange read back in Arabic.  This is one of the most disappointing aspects of editing an anthology: you don't get to enjoy it. However, because the Guide is so visual--because the designer John Coulthart has incorporated an illustration for each disease, among other things--I get a second chance. I will be able to enjoy the book on a visual level even though I can never read it again.  When I hold it in my hands and open it, I will simultaneously think to myself, "You are mad" and "You have helped to create something totally unique."  Jeff

      This evening, Ann and I received a pleasant surprise. For a year, we'd been sending in installments to Scott Eagle to buy the artwork he did for my book City of Saints & Madmen. It's just a wonderful piece of work, which not many people have seen in its entirety. Only pieces of it have been used for both the trade paperback and hardcover editions. It's now hanging on our wall in the livingroom--it looks stunning. I remember Scott telling me about the use of collage in the painting. It's partly his original work and partly bits and pieces from Brueghel, Bosch, and photographs. It all fits together seamlessly. But, as Scott told me, the collage wasn't originally seamless. Because each borrowed section came from a different work of art, the light shone from different angles in different parts of the painting. Scott therefore had to match the brushstrokes of these old masters to paint over the collage parts to redirect the light. The amazing thing is, I can't tell where he painted over the pieces and where he didn't. You can see the painting on his web site:  urlLink http://www.scotteagle.com .   Even more amazing is that the part where there's a halo around the woman's head forms an all-encompassing eye. If you look at the painting itself from a distance, you can see that all the lines of earth and river and cloudsin the background come together to  form an eye, which mimics the little eyes that surround the woman in a halo.  It's rather overwhelming to finally have this artwork in the house. It transforms the room.  JeffV

      The July 2003 issue of NYR of SF has arrived in the VanderMeer household, presaged by a house-wide fleaspray and a rather dangerous look in the eye of Pretty Ugly, one of our cats. Plenty of interesting reviews this time around--in particular:  - Walter Minkel's intriguing review of Diana Wynne Jones'  The Merlin Conspiracy . Minkel makes her work sound so enticing, I think I will have to sample it.  - Damien Broderick's fair/unfair review of Cory Doctorow's  Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom . Broderick's review is so influenced by the great publicity for the book that he damns it with faint praise. I don't think this book is as uneven as Broderick makes it out to be, but I do agree it's not as good as Jonathan Strahan and others have said. It's a small book, really an extended novella. It makes for decent entertainment, and as a first novel shows a lot of promise. Broderick should not use Doctorow's ability to publicize the book against him. Should he and his publishing house, TOR, have tried to be less successful in his PR efforts? "Please, NYT Book Review--I beg you: don't run that review of my book. I am not worthy." Of course not.  - Faren Miller's excellent analysis of K.J. Bishop's wonderful first novel,  The Etched City . Yet more publicity for an author and book that really deserve it. I would not be surprised if Bishop found a major U.S. publisher soon.  - Eugene Reynolds' suspect review of Jeffrey Ford's  The Fantasy Writer's Assistant and Other Stories , in which he tries to make the claim for Ford being a Catholic writer. I suppose it makes no difference how  Ford  defines himself. I'm afraid we have a kind of New Weird scenario in this review, whereby Reynold's attempts to make Ford conform to a narrow definition make the entire discussion of the work much less interesting. I'm glad it's a good review, because the book deserves it, but Reynold's approach is at times laughable.  - David Griffin's response to an article by Darrell Schweitzer, "The Uses of Fantasy." I can't recall the Schweitzer article, but apparently it concerned the divide between fantastical and realistic literature, especially as expressed through reviews and reviewers. Griffin points out a phenomenon that I've commented on several times in the last few years: fantastical literature has entered the mainstream, and is being reviewed in the mainstream. Griffin points to a recent  NYT Book Review  issue in which Edward Carey's fantastical  Alva & Irva  and Paco Ignacio Taibo's magic realist  Returning as Shadows  both received positive reviews in the general fiction review section. It is true that books marketed as genre are not getting reviewed much in the general fiction section of major review outlets, but fantasy  not  marketed as such  is  getting reviewed there. If such reviews drive sales, perhaps there is a lesson to be learned from that. More importantly, a lot of really good fantasy is being published through mainstream imprints. It pays to hunt around for it.   Jeff V

      In recent message board posts,  Locus  reviews editor and anthologist Jonathan Strahan has expressed bewilderment (and surprise) at expressions of what he calls "embattlement" among those writers and critics who tend toward the more "literary fantasy" end of the spectrum. Why, he asks, should such writers expect to sell as many copies as Robert Jordan, for example? Why should they seem "embattled" because of those high-end sales by writers who are considered "commercial." (I'm putting so many terms in quotes because the truth is "literary" and "commercial" are artificial terms, useful to give a general idea of what we are talking about, but ever-shifting, subjective.)  I agree with Jonathan that it's a bad position to take--to feel embattled over something like that. However, it's one thing to feel embattled--it's another to not want to set limitations others try to set on you. For my part, I can only say that I do not feel "embattled" or bitter or any other word that indicates I think I am entitled to large sales. At times, I  have  spoken out against reviewers writing in their reviews "VanderMeer's book may not be for everyone" or "VanderMeer may not sell as well as Terry Brooks, but..." The reason has nothing to do with feeling embattled or entitled. Instead, I feel that such comments unduly prejudice the reader to expect something that's either not as good or more exclusive than other writing, precisely because we live in a culture impressed by the enormity of sales and by money in all of its many permutations. But more importantly, if a reviewer enjoys a book, it is dishonest to then put a limitation on the book, to in essence try to indicate that "it's good for its type." Generalizations of this nature tend to be only half-true anyway.  Also for my part, if I lobby for anything, I lobby for letting my work and the work of other writers subjected to such unfair comparisons  find the maximum audience it is capable of having . I state this awkwardly, but here's my point: No one knows my maximum sales per book yet because I haven't yet had a book out from a major U.S. publisher. Having books coming out later this year from Pan MacMillan in the U.K. will certainly help me find my optimum audience. But the puzzle is only half complete until new work is bought by a large New York publisher and given proper distribution. My gut feeling, based on very stunning sales for the POD City of Saints & Madmen, is that I will compete very respectably. I'll be the first to admit I don't expect to reach Robert Jordan numbers. On the other hand, if you accept limitations others set on you, or that you set on yourself, you'll never reach even half of your more realistic goals.  Angela Carter always said she wanted her reach to exceed her grasp. I think such a philosophy can apply equally well to areas other than the creation of fiction.  JeffV

      One of the more audacious novels of the past few years,  Light  by M. John Harrison contains its own comment on labeling of fiction, I think. Whether Harrison intended it or not, the following passage speaks to the craft and art of creating fiction as well as anything in a book of writing advice:  "Every race [humankind] met on their way through the Core had a star drive based on a different theory. All those theories worked, even when they ruled out one another's basic assumptions. You could travel between the stars, it began to seem, by assuming anything. If your theory gave you a foamy space to work with--if you had to catch a wave--that didn't preclude some other engine, running on a perfectly smooth Einsteinian surface, from surfing from the same tranche of empty space. It was even possible to build drives on the basis of super-string-style theories, which, despite their promise four hundred years ago had never really worked at all...It was affronting to discover that..."  The same idea applies to fiction--you can use an almost infinite number of approaches to achieve the same or similar effects. It is true that I tend to espouse a single or single set of approaches to fiction (in part because I believe in this kind of fiction, but also because I find it underrepresented), but this doesn't mean I don't like other approaches.  The problem with labeling, or perhaps more specifically, "sublabeling," is that the proponents of the sublabel begin to think that their way is the only way, or that their way is superior. I think I'm guilty of this at times, too. But in fiction, this is simply not true. Thus the "affront" alluded to above--because, surely, one way  must  be better than another. And given that the political or social orientation of an individual usually has no bearing on whether or not that person can create great art, labels that arise due to political or social agendas in fiction often tend to flounder as well. The great thing the surrealists did is hardwire a true social/cultural (and therefore, I would argue, political) agenda to something that transcended social/cultural issues: the pursuit of liberty through beauty, through the imagination. If they had not done this, there would be no interest in surrealism today.  I also like this quote from Light because it illuminates the frightening thing about fiction--that you have so many choices, so many ways of getting from point A to point B (or in some cases, point C to point A, or point A to point 5). Of course, the more technique you pick up and the more flexible you allow your writing to be, so too the more choices; you might actually be quite limited in your choices otherwise, might be restricted to four or five or six possible ways to start a short story, for example.  The irony, of course, is that the more technique, the more mastery you gain, the more you find yourself starting from scratch with each new book or story. The more choices, the more chances you will get it wrong--choose wrong. So mastery actually equals uncertainty. The more mastery you achieve, the less confident you become, although I don't really mean "confidence" and "uncertainty" in the strict dictionary definitions of the words. This is a good kind of uncertainty, and a bad kind of confidence. Because you are uncertain, despite having mastery, you know that your writing is still alive, that you are not simply doomed to repeat the same path you chose so many times before. Because you feel once again as if you are writing your first book, you know that writing is still meaningful to you.  JeffV

      Yes, I am going to mention Harry Potter. As someone who grew up on the Narnia books and on Roald Dahl, I enjoy the Potter books because they contain echoes of those books from childhood. They differ in that JK Rowling is not a prose stylist--you don't read her books for beautiful language. But for interesting characters, carefully differentiated, and for good use of specific detail when she needs to, Rowling does a very good job. She tends to suffer a bit lately from openings that could be condensed without hurting the structure of the book, but I don't mind that much, to be honest.   The really brilliant thing she has done is retrofitted the fantasy genre with the mystery genre and what I'm told is a kind of British boarding-school fiction tradition.  I can certainly see how a British person might be put off by the books--that perhaps they perpetuate cliches not as apparent to American readers, for example. But I remain mystified by the idea some people have that kids should not read these books, perhaps because they're too traditional. Ironically enough, you have people on the far left and the far right dissing these books. Then you also have the genre community, in part, looking up their collective nose at them. It's all rather funny, actually.  Personally, I think all of it becomes fodder for the imagination when you're that age. It really doesn't matter how the author intended the books to be received--kids will always have their own interpretations.  Do I think the Rowling books are timeless classics? Probably not. But they're much better than her critics give her credit for. And anytime a book, especially books like these that are far and away above your average Robert Jordan fantasy novel in quality, can excite readers to the point that they'll camp outside a bookstore at midnight to pick one up, I'd say that's a good thing.

      Final post for now--about Shelley Jackson. If you haven't encountered this amazing writer, you need to pick up her short story collection  The Melancholy of Anatomy , read her story "Angel" in Trampoline, edited by Kelly Link, and also pick up  The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric & Discredited Diseases , which has two contributions by her.  She reminds me of Angela Carter without being a pastiche of Carter. But she has the same steely nerve combined with the flourish for language and form. Really wonderful stuff.  By the way--if you can buy what I'm telling you about on Amazon, I'm not going to bother to include links.  Jeff

      With regard to my last post, this quote from Edward A. Gargan's nonfiction book THE RIVER's TALE: A Year on the Mekong, seems somehow appropriate:  "Yet the Mekong no more binds Asia together than does a wider notion of a shared Asianness, an idea bandied about by the proponents of authoritarianism...who claim to find some deeper meaning in a grab bag of aphorisms ladled out under the rubric "Asian values." A Tibetan monk would find little to say to a Thai insurance agent, even though at sunrise both wake next to the Mekong River, and both are Buddhist. Indeed, as the Mekong scythes its way through mountains and slithers past rice paddies, the river itself is called by many names on its three-thousand-mile journey to the sea: to the Vietnamese, it is the Cuu Long; Tonle Thom, Tonle Sap, or Tonle Thuc to the Khmer; Mae Nam Khong to the Thai and Laotians; Lancang Jiang to the Chinese; and to the Tibetans, Dzachu."  And yet it is, of course, the same river. I'm still working through my thoughts on how I think this quote relates to fiction and to fantastical fiction at this point in time, but there is a resonance that is making me think about it.  The book, by the way, is excellent, despite a rather bad first paragraph.  Jeff

      There are several issues regarding fantastical fiction that have been eating at me for the last couple of weeks. One concerns the "New Weird" label being bandied about by China Mieville and by several other British writers and critics. I had just gotten to the point where I was comfortable and satisfied with the literal Rennaissance of wonderful non-realist fiction being written today--a kind of simultaneous explosion/implosion that has incorporated possibly every relevant mainstream/genre influence into this amazing melange of surrealism, magic realism, decadent work, etc.--when along comes New Weird. (See: The Third Alternative Harrison message boards, also the Night Shade boards.)  While I think that the perpetrators of this term are sincere in not wanting to use it to describe a movement, I believe the effect will be to create a movement--and to create a movement that is both limiting and somewhat drab. New Weird, in rejecting postmodern approaches and in believing specifically in the "surrender" of the reader to the text--i.e., no sense of play in which the writer reveals to the reader that both reader and writer know this is only a story being read--is perfectly legitimate. But it's also reactionary. This approach simply ignores the cross-pollination going on across the world at this moment. As such, New Weird will, if it becomes a movement, wind up boxing itself off from the rest of the world. It will define itself only in relation to the New Weird protocols and it will attempt to reject that which exists outside of itself. This may not be the intent of its founders, but it will be the result. That's simply how these things work. Now, granted, there will be plenty of authors who are defined as having produced New Weird work but who are not themselves New Weird--i.e., they also produce work that is not New Weird. But the problem is--they'll be stuck with it by that point. There may even be a kind of stultifying effect on the imaginations of those who profess to be New Weird--in a sense, the label becomes a straitjacket.  So, one asks, why don't surrealism or decadent or magic realism labels become a straitjacket in a similar way? I think in the case of surrealism and decadence the terms described a way of life as well as a type of literature--and it described not only literature, but all of the arts. In the case of magic realism, I'm not sure why it doesn't seem like a straitjacket. It might be because magic realism has come to mean any story in which an element of the fantastic enters into an otherwise realistic setting. Further, because these are established terms, a writer can use them to describe him or herself without fear of becoming tagged by a present-day, as-yet-untested terminology that might in future limit that writer's work. The terms are benign enough, in other words, to allow a certain amount of flexibility--and they aren't what you might call "hot button" terms.  Can New Weird be thought of as a good way to describe a "moment" as some have suggested, as a way to get our minds around what is happening right now in fantastical fiction? I would argue that it has limitations there as well.  For the very reasons stated above--it in no way defines the entirety of what is going on in the field.  A good example would be The Light Ages by Ian R. MacLeod. A wonderful novel in a kind of Dickensian tradition mixed with many other influences. It's an amazingly well-written work, and it has many virtues. That it may not fit a certain political mindset or a particular definition of New Weird would seem to me to be beside the point--and yet one of the first things that occurred on the New Weird message board was an attempt to define the novel as New Weird or not New Weird. In fact, the debate about this issue is irrelevant. It in no way addresses the strengths of the book, and it simplifies the discussion about the book to a kind of for/against New Weird discussion. I would argue that this is the kind of discussion that will occur in genre if New Weird becomes an accepted "movement".   In any event, here's to a happy lack of labeling. Here's to diversity without name or number. Here's to the truly amazing things happening in fantastical literature today.  Jeff

      Welcome to my new blog. Will it be fun? Will it be excruciating? Will it be everything it could have been? We shall see.  To introduce myself: I am a writer of surreal and magic realist fiction, in short story, novella, and novel forms. You can buy my books on Amazon.com and you can check out some of my short fiction at  urlLink http://www.infinityplus.co.uk . I write a lot of nonfiction as well, which has appeared in The Washington Post, Publishers Weekly, Locus Online, and many others.  Right now, I am in the middle of pre-production on The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric & Discredited Diseases. More on that here:  urlLink http://www.lambsheadguide.com , and on the  urlLink http://www.nightshadebooks.com/discus/  message boards.  I've also just turned in the manuscript to a collection of poetry and flash fictions, The Day Dali Died, and am trying to finish up a new novel, Shriek: An Afterword.

      My wife just fished my old census worker bag out of the closet this past weekend. I'm kind of a pack rat, so it's not unusual for such relics to show up out of the flotsam and jetsam of our closets. But I was surprised at the number of memories it brought back. My sister Elizabeth and I both worked for the census in 1990. We were both going to the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and needed money over the summer months when we weren't in class and didn't have financial aid.  Going door-to-door asking people personal questions about their lives and finances has got to be one of the best jobs for a writer. Depending on the neighborhoods we covered, we got to see the full diversity of people in Gainesville. Usually, we split up, Elizabeth covering one area and me another. At that time, I didn't drive, so she'd drop me off before going on to her own assignment. It was like parachuting into some foreign land. I'd get out of the car armed with my census satchel, my notepad of questionnaires, my pencils, a map, and a print out showing which addresses I was supposed to take care of that day. At the end of the day, Elizabeth would come get me at a pre-arranged location and we'd report in to the section leader with our information. Usually, the section leader was operating out of an apartment dumpier than ours and you'd have a real sense that the information you'd gathered might or might not make it back to HQ.  That job that summer was one of the most pleasant experiences I've ever had. It was the middle of summer, and hot. But it wasn't the kind of heat that shimmers and distorts--it was a still kind of heat, a utilitarian heat, through which objects and places became more, not less, clear. This clarity leant itself to the collection of details, and I remember a kind of rising excitement and, dare I say it, glee, because by the end of summer, I would have a whole catalog of new moments to plug into my short stories. I couldn't have been happier if I'd been lying back on soft pillows being fed cliched grapes by beautiful naked women.  What did the job consist of? Basically, I got to walk around all day in strange places knocking on people's doors. I'd go from upscale condo sections of town to half-deserted trailer parks to lower middle-class families in small concrete houses. I met everyone from a harried stay-at-home mom dealing with three small children to a man who was convinced that the CIA was after him. I met landlords who openly told me they'd never rent to an African-American. I entered what was basically a crackhouse only to find the inhabitants too wasted to answer any questions. I met a Chinese woman as fragile as a thrush who was literally shaking with fear because she thought I was an INS agent, even as she answered my questions in a small voice. I interviewed nine mechanics living in one tiny mobile home. Outside, they had two Mercedes and three BMWs, which they owned. They could have sold the cars and probably gotten much better housing, but they didn't give a crap about their housing--they wanted nice cars. (How could I judge? All I wanted were nice books.)  Two incidents stand out vividly against this backdrop, one serious, one funny. First, I entered this broken down mobile home park to interview just one resident--this was a call-back. Another census worker had already covered the mobile home park, but this particular person hadn't answered her door. So she comes out and she's ancient--she's got to be in her 80s, very fragile bone structure, and these large glasses with very thick lenses and thick dark frames. Through them, her eyes seemed to be miles away. She had on a housecoat, I can't remember the color, and she had homemade bandages covering both of her hands. She did not seem in distress, but she was very happy to see someone. She had trouble communicating--sometimes I could understand her and sometimes I couldn't. She would stop and start in her speech, as if she wasn't used to regular conversation anymore. And there I was, with all of these questions. I don't know if she was excited about that, or disappointed at the type of questions. For yes and no questions she would just nod or shake her head, as if she knew that she was having difficulty talking. I didn't get the sense that she was mentally impaired, although I did suspect she might slip in and out of dementia. Eventually, I found out during the course of questioning that she had burnt her hands on the stove, both hands. She held her hands in her lap, palms up. Her hands in those thick windings of bandages were so huge lying in her tiny lap. She was two hands and these huge glasses. I asked if she needed help and she shook her head. I caught the same whiff of fear I caught off of many of the elderly people I interviewed. If the Chinese woman had thought the INS was going to deport her, then the elderly feared that someone would report they were not competent to live on their own. Eventually, I had asked my questions. It was time to leave. I said goodbye and walked off. When I looked back after taking thirty or forty steps, she was still standing at the door to her mobile home, with her large, bandaged hands hanging off of her slack arms. I really felt this unbelievable sense of sorrow at that moment, as if I were looking back at an image of pure loneliness. It was an absurd emotion to have in some ways, because I didn't know that much about her. For all I knew, she had friends who came to look in on her from time to time. But my gut told me she didn't have anyone, and hadn't had anyone for some time. When I got back to HQ, I told them about the woman, and they contacted someone in social services to check up on her. All night, I kept thinking the usual thoughts, that she'd once had a family, that this could be anyone's fate, given a bad break of luck, the wrong things happening at the wrong moment. Somehow, the image of her standing at the door to her mobile home staring after me became a spectre at my shoulder thereafter, and I didn't like my solitude trudging down strange streets quite as much. For me, it was a luxury--I was just doing it for lark and to make some money. What if I had no choice but to do that?  The other thing I remember happened before I met the old woman, when I was digging the job a bit more. I was in such a groove, so deep into my thoughts that sometimes it seemed like I just magically appeared before the next door--there was no walking, because while I was walking I was thinking or so not thinking that it didn't seem like time had passed. The danger of this did not occur to me until I walked up to one house and knocked on the door only to get no response--after several minutes and more knocking. Then I saw that this chain had been attached to one of the poles supporting the porch. Oh, thought I, well maybe if I follow the chain, I'll find someone. So, like some kind of sun-drugged zombie, I followed the chain into the backyard...where it ended, predictably enough, attached to the collar of a Rottweiler. I looked at the Rottweiler. The Rottweiler looked at me. It began barking and running toward me at the same time I began running back into the front yard. I managed to elude the extremity of its reach at the end of the chain just in time. I'd dropped some of my pencils, but I wasn't going back for them. As I walked down the street on very shaky legs, I started laughing. I couldn't stop for quite some time, because I was reliving the insane series of "logical" assumptions that had led to me following a very obvious dog chain into that backyard. It might have more sense if I'd been smoking marijuana or something--oh, cool, look, a chain. Let's follow that and see what happens.  In general, though, the job was uneventful. I still remember the genuine feeling of anonymity it gave me, and the resulting thrill. I was a phantom passing through, just an anonymous voice prepared to ask questions. I'd never meet any of these people again. I'd probably never walk any of these streets again. The heat was utilitarian, and so were my questions, but my body was ethereal, a mirage. I got some great writing done that summer, just topnotch. I think it had to have been because of the walking, just getting into a kind of receptive, almost trance-like state.  Most writers have had more than their share of interesting jobs. From time to time, I may write about more of mine--from writing letters to Michael Jackson for one employer who wanted to increase the use of small aircraft, to an ectoplasmic-walled hotel built for midgets encountered on one business trip, to the madman who once wanted to beat the shit out of me in the lobby of a Holiday Inn in Ft. Myers, to my stint at Book Warehouse, otherwise known as the Devil's Armpit of remaindered bookstores...But more on all of that later.  Jeff

      Over the past 10 to 15 years, I've had the opportunity to teach fiction writing in one-on-one situations, through manuscript critiques. I also used to teach high school seniors through Merlin's Pen magazine. More recently, I've had a chance to teach writing to groups. The Florida Suncoast Writers' Conference allowed me to do both individual sessions and group workshops, with more opportunities upcoming in the next couple of years.  I really enjoy teaching because I like to be of use and I genuinely enjoy the interaction with beginning writers. However, teaching also re-teaches me technique and approaches to fiction. When you have to try to see fiction writing through another's approach or point of view, you re-examine your own approach. You also give yourself a refresher course in beginner and intermediate technique, which is always useful.  There are, of course, a number of ways in which teaching can go wrong. Having been a student at workshops both good and bad, I can attest to that. And my own technique in teaching has become more refined over the years. A few simple guidelines help make the experience good for the students and the instructor.  The most fundamental rule that you must follow as an instructor is not to impose your approach on the student. (If Faulkner had ever been Hemingway's writing instructor, it would have been unwise for him to suggest Hemingway write like him.) You should impart your knowledge of writing in the service of what the student wishes to accomplish with his or her writing. In some rare cases, you may see that the student's ambition falls short of their full potential, and then you may push that student harder, or you may suggest a change in direction.   That said, understanding a student's approach does not mean you should endorse a flawed execution of that approach. You should always be honest with your students. Honesty, however, does not mean exhibiting cruelty toward the student in question. Some instructors believe in a dog-eat-dog approach, a kind of Artistic Darwinism within a workshop setting. For my own part, I've found that most students respond much better to questions than to blunt words. In many cases, if you use harsh words, the student is so hung up on the method by which the message has been delivered that the message itself gets lost. If, on the other hand, you ask questions like "Did you mean for this character to seem passive?" or "Did you mean for this character's actions to be inconsistent?" Even as neutral a question as "How do you see this character?" can be the beginning of a positive conversation about a deficiency in the writing. Questions generally serve to get the student to come to a conclusion on his or her own, which is the first step to internalizing a solution.  In groups, certain kinds of honesty can foster an artificially competitive atmosphere. Public comparisons during a group workshop of one student's writing to another's in terms of broad strokes--"Jim's story is much better than yours"--are counterproductive and generally set students in competition with each other. More specific comments, like "George--that flaw we talked about in your story: see how Jim successfully handles the same technique in his story," may or may not be useful, depending on the overall cohesion and comraderie in the group.  Some instructors believe that workshops should simulate the cutthroat world of publishing, in which rejection is constant even for very successful writers. However, workshops are not good environments in which to simulate the issues a writer must face in the "real world" outside of the workshop. A nasty rejection slip in the mail, for example, is not the same as having an instructor or fellow writers issue a nasty or snide critique in person in a workshop setting. What a workshop should strive for is clear, effective communication about the story being critiqued. A cogently-argued critique, delivered in a bloodless, clinical matter, or leavened by humor, has the greatest chance of making the subject of the critique really think about his or her story.  From time to time an instructor will make a mistake in a workshop--either in the initial evaluation of the story, or in understanding some individual element of the story. In such cases, no matter how much potential "authority" you may lose, you have to admit that you made a mistake, rather than stick to your guns. Ultimately, the students will respect your willingness to admit to a mistake, but disrespect obvious dishonesty.  When critiquing manuscripts, it is very important to provide at least two levels of critique: specific and general. Comments specific to a story are helpful, but unless put in the context of a general assessment, the student may miss the point, or not be able to apply the "fix" to other stories. With specific comments, it is most useful to start by critiquing the story at the level at which it fails--whether style, characterization, realization of setting, etc. Generally, the major weakness of the story is the most useful element by which to eventually discuss the story as a whole. More importantly, it is relatively useless to discuss higher level elements of the story if something at a lower level is flawed--subtext, for example, if the surface of the story is hopelessly mishapen. (If at all possible, you should separate out specific comments into subcategories to aid in helping the student find strategies to make corrections.)  The general comments about weaknesses should be accompanied by exercises intended to correct the deficiency, much as a fitness instructor would evaluate a client's overall health and then propose exercise intended to bolster atrophied muscles.  A lot of students come to a workshop seeking validation. It is wise to correct this misconception about workshops from day one, in front of the group. It is my firm belief that an instructor is not there to validate anyone's work. Your job is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each student's fiction and make suggestions and provide guidance as appropriate. Guidance may include advice on submitting stories that seem ready for publication. It does not include making general pronouncements about who is or is not really a writer, or pronouncements about who is going to have greater or lesser success, especially in any group forum. For one thing, no one can really predict who will or won't make it. I'm also not a big believer in the reverse psychology of using this labeling method to push a writer to do better. It's very risky, and it puts the instructor in the role of playing god, to an extent. (You should, as a teacher, resist most all impulses that seem aimed more at bolstering your own ego than helping your students.)  It may, on the other hand, be useful in one-on-one sessions to prepare more idiosyncratic writers for the roadblocks they may face in getting their work published. (Certainly, you can and should share your knowledge of publishing to help make that side of the writing profession easier.)  Finally, you may (very rarely) find yourself unable to help a student. The student may be too advanced or the student may be writing material in a style so foreign to you, using influences with which you are not familiar, that your advice could be more harmful than helpful. In such cases, you should refer the student to some other instructor.  It is perhaps important for me to state the obvious with regard to teaching because too often lately I've come across the attitude that workshops should be akin to dog fighting events. "You haven't lived until X has ripped you a new one," for example. This kind of false machismo is antithetical to the very idea of writing.  The publishing world itself--even just regularly submitting to magazines and anthologies--does quite well in hardening beginning writers to the life they have chosen. Workshops by their very nature are stressful enough without subjecting the student to unnecessary stress. If a writer does not have the endurance to get through that without further "hazing" at a workshop, then that writer never had the toughness to gut it out in the first place. Besides, clear, crisp communication is devastating enough to most students.  Jeff

      Yesterday, for the day job, my cohorts and I visited a marine institute in Panacea, Florida. It had begun as a procurement center through which universities could acquire marine specimens, but gradually, over time, became devoted more to education and eco-tourism. Now, the tanks, which are really "vats" or "containers," few of them with glass sides, but built so that you can easily put your hands in them and pick up things, are used as much for letting school groups pass through and touch sea urchins, crabs, snail shells, as for any other reason. For me, it was a kind of nostalgic experience. Seeing the hawksbill turtles at the marine institute reminded me of when my mom, a biological illustrator at the time, would draw turtles while a Peace Corps volunteer in Fiji. We'd watch as the turtles dragged themselves over the grass of our front yard, and Mom would create these scientifically-accurate drawings of them.  And, as a kid growing up in Fiji, one of my fondest memories was wading through the tidal pools and reefs. Those tanks at the institute were like miniature versions of those adventures, and it was both fun and odd to watch kids interacting with the sea life. On the one hand, it was great for them. On the other, they were missing the context of those creatures in a truly wild place.  Strangely, I've never been able to write Fiji into any of my stories. It is the first place I have vivid memories of as a child. I've been able to write about every country I've ever visited, but not the one (other than the U.S.) that I spent any amount of time in. I'm not quite sure why. It might be that the place is already mythologized in my memories.  I have taken a stab at some nonfiction about Fiji from time to time--here's a passage that epitomizes what I loved about the place:  Some nights--the best nights--Mom and Dad would take my sister and me to the shallows of offshore reefs.  In sneakers and shorts we would shine our flashlights into that miraculous darkness, revealing bridges and stairwells and thoroughfares of red, yellow, orange coral. Phosphorescent squid shot through the breaches in the coral like miniature balloons rapidly losing air. Drab brown moray eels with gold-veined eyes hissed from worn worm holes while cumbersome cowrie shells with lip-pink snails lumbered gracefully through the sudden spotlight. Tiny emerald fish schooled together, then broke apart into a hundred jeweled tears at the first hint of danger, before coming back together again to form a sparkling chandelier. Against this backdrop, striped Spanish Dancers, living skirts of jelly-like flesh, danced their slow fandangos, oblivious to our intrusion.  The wind, cool and rhythmic, would lull our senses, while on the nearby shore, ghost crabs shadowed our progress and the distant lights of civilization seemed deliciously inconsequential, even ridiculous, in comparison with the smooth, sleek-black world we had entered . . .   One night, with the sea murmuring and gasping all around, we walked farther than we had ever walked before, so that the lights of the shore were only a memory and our flashlights as small against the night as the moon reflected in a man's eyes.  The reef cut against our ankles and the water salted the wounds, but we continued on, until, for one frightening moment, we could not tell shore from sea, and if we were to have spun blindly, we would have opened our eyes to a world completely unknown and unknowable.  But we didn't; instead, we started back toward the shore.  Half-way back, we came upon a grotto filled with water, and in the water a creature we had never before seen--a Crown of Thorns, a type of beautiful yet deadly starfish, bigger than a dinner plate, bronze-brown, its thousands of thorns glistening like dark gold. Eater of reefs, destroyer of entire tiny worlds.  I felt such a thrill of discovery in that moment, to be standing on the reef with only our flashlights for illumination, crouched over that grotto, looking down on this creature that seemed so otherworldly and alien.  Such bittersweet juxtapositions of beauty and destruction. In that moment, I thought that there could be no sensation better than this one: the shivering delight upon discovery of the sublime and the unknown.  Jeff

      Why do we write? There are all sorts of mundane or usual answers to that question--to express ourselves, to tell a story, to entertain, to explore the human condition, to be well-known,  to be known well , to be wealthy. But there are other answers that have more to do with the actual moment of creation. It's perhaps a little more personal and therefore embarrassing or revealing to talk about--or  revelatory . It's the moment when you feel as if you are outside your body yet more intensely inside your body than ever before. It's the spark, the orgasm, the shock that makes you keep slogging through endless days when all you're doing is marching through pages and hoping that the rewrites, the editor in you, will salvage the material. Is it simply a matter of allowing the world into you like water poured into an empty glass?  I wrote my best description of this sensation for a short story called "Experiment #25 in the Book of Winter: The Croc and You":  The writer picked up his cigar and breathed in its thickness. Take winter—such a bracing time of year, he thought, addressing the glowing red tip as if it were a good friend. Every detail on the sidewalk, from a rage of red-orange leaves to a green meandering crack in the concrete, took on a binocular significance. It was a forethought of the awareness that overtook him when he wrote: the premonition of something moving through him and onto the page, the pen in hand become a blur and the heart so full, limbs aflame, body with fever. Like sparks burrowing into you until, finally conquered, you become vessel, container not contained—trapped and free—and all the little hairs on your arms rise, and you feel as if your own skin has been painlessly flayed back to reveal, beneath the perfect diagram of veins and arteries, the beauty and horror of the world—the words like tiny mysteries and the combinations of words solutions to those mysteries, and yet more mysterious for the revelation...and you’re crying silently because, after all, these words are your life, even in distilled form, even brought forth by an unknown will...and you know this is the closest you will personally ever come to an awareness of what God might mean—this feeling that so encompasses the whole of your being that you are unimaginable strength and weakness intertwined...and in the aftermath, the writer often found, as the madness left him, that he would observe, say, the reflected worlds within a perfect drop of water as it lazed in the sudden sunlight across the yard, and was spent, exhausted, by even that simple image.  Although, as I also observed in that story, the feeling has a falsehood buried within it: what you write when in ecstasy is not always any better than what you write at other, less inspired, times...

      In the midst of a last push toward completion of the fake disease guide, I've had a couple of hours of solitude during which I've not been connected to the Internet, not had the TV on, not been working on something. It's been a long time since I've had solitude. The lack of it can eat away at your center. In a writer, it can shorten attention span, make it difficult to get into that deep, submerged place that your power comes from. Instead of allowing things to come into you, you are continually projecting things out from you, if that makes any sense. It will seem as if you are in a sense accumulating more power, but in fact you are diminished because nothing is flowing into you. It creates fatigue, and a certain amount of irritation.  Now that I can see the disease guide almost behind me, I can also see how much white noise I've allowed to accumulate around me. Except it's not really white noise--it's more of a dark noise, a noise with a substance and texture like an electric shock or sandpaper. It's a barrage of positive reviews, negative reviews, good vibes from a contact made, bad vibes from a contact made, anger and irritation and satisfaction and fondness and love originating from a hundred glimpsed or participated in electronic conversations about everything from New Weird to the festival of the freshwater squid. Taken separately, it's harmless enough, but all bundled together it equates to a hundred received ideas trying to get into your skull and make you into their version of what they think you are. (This is not a complaint--when you decide, as I have, to push your work hard, it's inevitable--but it does mean I need to reevaluate. At some point, there has to be an end to it: an end through which the work itself flies through to a new place, impervious to what anyone might think of it.)  In a sense, the total immersion in the disease guide and other projects, including PR for projects, is reducing me to starting over. When I start to write again, it will be hesitant and stumbling. I'll have to relearn or re-remember certain ideas or rules I knew before but have not had to live inside of for many months. In relearning them, I will come to see them from a different angle. This will in turn make the writing take on different facets or fractures. It affects the reading, too. because my attention span has been so divided between so many different projects, my reading has been sporadic, embryonic--start-stopping on one book after the next; a collection of beginnings with no middle or end. As I become a pure writer again, without distraction, I'll learn to read again, in a way.  Whenever I'm at the end of a tough, long campaign for a book I've written or edited, I begin to turn away from it--it's just a husk, a skeleton, dry and brittle--and I turn toward this kind of  space  that is not yet filled or complete. It's dark around the edges. It might contain a horizon, or it might just be a field of stars. There's a sense of something coming down from above, from a distance, at a great speed, but so far away that even if I saw what it was it would appear to be moving slowly. I can sense the need to become hermitlike, to withdraw, in order to receive what's coming.  This time, something quite different is coming. Whatever's waiting is a kind of sea-change for me. It won't be evident right away, because I'm working on a novel I've been working on for years, and that novel is going to pull me back into what I did before. But it may be evident in some of the new short stories. I feel good about it. I feel good that something new seems to be coming out of me.  Now, I just need to find solitude, and a way to drown out the white noise. There's only one way to do that. I have to write.  JeffV

      Michael Cisco is a criminally underrated author, in part because his work is sometimes difficult (in the best sense of the word), sometimes morally ambiguous, and because he's an original. It hasn't helped that many of his manuscripts have been tied up at various publishing houses for literally years and years--or that Mythos Books has been lethargically slow in putting out a Cisco short story collection that when it now appears will be hopelessly out-of-date, no longer reflective of the writer's progress.  Luckily, however, Michael's original triumph, The Divinity Student (winner of an International Horror Guild Award), will be released by my Ministry of Whimsy Press along with its sequel, The Golem, under the title The San Veneficio Canon. The San Veneficio Canon will be published in February 2004. In the meantime, Michael's novel The Tyrant will be published by Prime Books in November 2003. In that book, Michael has the audacity to depict the invasion of Heaven by the minions of Hell--and then the invasion of Hell by the minions of Heaven. Basically, Michael is fearless.  In late 2004, or early 2005, the Ministry will publish Michael's novel The Traitor. I just finished reading the manuscript, and all I can say is that he's somehow managed to create a unique existential horror story, complete with beautiful, blood-curdling scenes--it's an amazing mix of Gene Wolfe, William Burroughs, and Samuel Beckett, with a touch of Thomas Ligotti. I'm excited about all of Michael's work, but I'm very excited about this novel--I think it's a true classic in the making.  I'll leave you with an excerpt. The Traitor is set in an imaginary land in which spirit eaters exist to literally absorb and thus get rid of spirits that would otherwise harass the living. The spirit eaters must then discharge the "ectoplasmic" energy they "eat" by letting it flow into other people, usually in a way beneficial to those who receive it (healed wounds, etc.) The Traitor describes the life of the spirit-eater first person narrator and his interactions with a spirit eater called White. White is a renegade. He does not discharge the energy from eating spirits. Instead, he keeps it for himself--it makes him incredibly powerful, but it also burns him up from the inside. Among the many stunning scenes in the book is the one where the narrator, part of a group charged with bringing White to justice, begins to catch up with White:  Whenever I picture White to myself, I picture him running in the cold humid air between the trees.  We caught sight of him time and again, always in front of us, sometimes off to one side and then almost immediately he would be off to the other side.  I could make him out only as an obscure patch moving in and out of view in the distance.  There was no place he did not seem to be.  He appeared and disappeared.  I saw him only intermittently, but despite this, I could see very clearly that he was somehow on fire.  He was enveloped in fire.  A transparent flame played about his body from head to foot, and his body seemed to emit, even in complete silence, as I discovered later, a thunderous, inaudible roar that made the air shudder rigidly as he passed through it.  At one point, he appeared close by.  He jumped from a bluff overhanging a dry riverbed, and landed on his feet with a deafening report, and the sand around his feet flew back in a circle.  White merely straightened himself and vanished into the trees again.  The men pursued him, and I followed.  They were frightened, and eager, and carried rifles which they held low to the ground, hovering just above the ground.  We were all going faster every moment.  At this point we had fanned out in a long line several riders deep.  The dogs, and the birds in the trees, together with the hooves of the horses and the random shot, were all I could hear - except that at times I would hear White scream from far ahead, this from the great effort he was making.  White's screams were brittle and metallic, and they hung motionless in the air, they hung motionless in the air like hanged men.  I was terrified, but unable to control my horse, and it followed the others.  We were so deep in the woods that on all sides there were nothing but trees, very old, very black, and their boughs closed out the sun, whose light was greyed, flattened and diffused by the clouds.  White was all around us, he seemed to flash in and out among the horses, and I saw his pale ghostly face, glaring, furious, flashing past ahead of me in the shadows of the trees.  Wind flooded over me and I saw it brought with it the flavor of something invisible that was coming, and then I heard men and horses screaming ahead of me, and dogs howling, my horse jerked back as if he'd been shot and I was nearly knocked from my saddle, leaving me hanging from its side, and I jumped down.  My horse staggered back past me.

      At the World Fantasy Convention last year, I moderated a panel on books as artifacts--the personal nature of books. I recently found the materials I prepared for that panel and thought I'd post them here. I like all of the answers from various writers, collected before the panel, but Michael Cisco's responses are particularly stunning to me, as are Zoran Zivkovic's rather cheeky replies.  Jeff  THE PHYSICALITY OF BOOKS: A SURVEY Compiled by Jeff VanderMeer  Good evening. Thanks for joining us tonight. To be here at 10 at night on Halloween already demonstrates an abiding love for books. Or perhaps for panels. My name is Jeff VanderMeer and I'll be moderating tonight's panel on books.  By way of introduction, let me just say that a finely made book, well designed and executed, can be intoxicating. It exists as a creative act irrespective of the book's contents. And, at the place where content and format fuse, you will find the perfect book. That perfect book differs for every reader, but what remains constant among book lovers is a sense that their need for books is more than just an act of nostalgia. It can be highly personal and eccentric. It can be a search for order. Or it can represent an awareness of the aesthetics and culture behind book design and book execution.  We're here to talk about how books are personal to each of us and perhaps a little bit about the relevancy of books today.  But before we begin, I'd like to do two things—first, hand out this photo album with photos from the Babylon Lexicon at the New Orleans Independent Book Fair last weekend. The Babylon Lexicon is a display of hand-made and eccentric books from all over the country. What struck me as most interesting is that the majority of the books' creators were people in their twenties. They were all very excited about the possibilities of books as art and artifact. They did not find such an idea at odds with our modern world of computers and the Internet. In fact, they seemed to like living in both the world of books and the electronic world. Also for the Book Fair, I asked a number of writers and publishers from around the world about their relationship to books. Some of their responses are also included in this photo album and I'll also read from some during the course of the evening.  [Alas, no one actually taped the panel itself, but below you'll find some of the answers I'd solicited from various writers and editors in the months prior to the panel, in preparation for it.]     What do you most like about the book as a physical object?   Des Lewis: The book as physical object was the container, the thing that gifted what I yearned – so, by association with what it gifted, it became a loved object, by look and smell and feel, and assumed taste. The stitching, the tooled spine, the foxing, the heady waft of predictions of nostalgia in future life …  Ian Nichols: Its sensuality. A book is tangible, and the paper picks up scents, finger marks, stains and dust. It is, in itself, a history, as well as a text.  Michael Cisco: It is silent.  Patient.  It waits for me to animate it, and to animate me in turn.  This patience and quietness are related, and both in turn related to the book's relationship to time.  Real books are created to endure for the benefit of unborn persons, like time capsules.  They act as silent witnesses, whose testimony is immediately available.  Zoran Zivkovic: The erotic fact that I can take it with me to the bed.    Do you have any rituals or procedures you go through after acquiring a new (or used) book? (Some writers indicate they bite or smell books.)   Gordon Van Gelder: The former CEO at St. Martin's, Tom McCormack, loved the smell of old books. I was taken aback in a meeting when I brought out an 1950s book from my father's library and Tom cracked open the book, stuck his nose deep in the binding, and took a big whiff.  David Langford: Doesn't everyone have a quick sniff? New books are rarely aromatically interesting, but certain U.S. paper from the first half of the 20th century has matured to exude a waft of Essential Book. Another small ritual consists of either gently removing penciled-in second-hand prices with an art eraser, or shouting F***WIT! at prices scrawled in ink.  Michael Cisco: I have sniffed books in my time, but not as part of a fixed protocol of book-buying (more like a pastime).  When I buy books and bring them home, I set them aside in piles, depending on the kind of reading they represent (research, pleasure, subway).  When I've read them, they all go onto a shelving pile.  Once the shelving pile is a foot or two high, I alphabetize the books, measure the height of the pile, displace an equivalent amount of already-shelved books to make room for the new ones (my shelves are deep enough for double-stacking:  the back rows are all filled, and now the fronts are filling up), then insert the new books in the proper places.  In this way, I am able to find any book fairly swiftly.  I derive from this operation, also, a profound sense of well-being.  I don't merely possess my books;  they form a precisely-ordered system over which I preside.  Looking at the books on my shelves, I enjoy their order.  Tamar Yellin: I feel its weight, and flip through its pages to feel the weight and quality of the paper. The smell is also important. At some point -- unable to help myself -- I will check how many pages it has. This seems to answer some deep psychological need, like establishing how many miles there are to cover on a journey, whether or not it's meant to be a journey of pleasure.    Is it necessary for books to exist as physical objects in our increasingly electronic world? If so, why?   Zoran Zivkovic: Of course it is! I can think of many, many reasons. One of them is the practical impossibility and moral abomination of taking a computer with me to the bed.  Michael Cisco: I've never heard yet any suggestion that paintings on gallery walls be replaced with computer facsimilies hanging on flat screens, or that all music henceforth be created exclusively on computers.  Or that all food be cooked on computer screens and eaten by little programs while the user sucks feebly at the keyboard.    Our world may be increasingly electronic, but it might becoming decreasingly electronic in the future;  and nowhere is it written that everyone everywhere will eventually have computer access.  Scrapping books would be like insisting everyone live underground - expensive and pointless.    What recent examples stand out for you as exemplar of well-designed, well-made books?   Jack Dann: the Folio Society in London make very nice books.  Also small press publishers such as Arkham House, Easton Press, Ziesing,  Lord John Press, Shadowlands Press, and especially Donald M. Grant.  Stephen Gallagher: THE ANNOTATED LOST WORLD, edited by Pilot and Rodin. Published by The Wessex Press, Indianapolis. A perfect meshing of content, design and materials.  Rhys Hughes: I admire the productions of Tartarus, Sarob and Savoy.   Harvey Jacobs: The books published by Pushcart Press are particularly attractive.  John Klima: Mark Z. Danielewski's HOUSE OF LEAVES did some very difficult things with layout, leading me to say that it was well-designed, but that the design didn’t help the story. THE CHEESE MONKEYS by Chip Kidd had phenomenal design.  David Langford: Alasdair Gray's anthology =The Book of Prefaces= (2000)  Stephen Jones: Quite simply, the best books currently being produced in the genre are the Robert E. Howard titles being published by Wandering Star.  Jay Lake: the limited edition printing of Gene Wolfe's EMPIRES OF FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS  Scott Thomas: The Monkey's Paw and Other Tales of Mystery and the Macabre, from Academy of Chicago Publishers, has a lovely autumnal cover by French artist Victor Prouve that sets the perfect tone for a collection of old fashioned stories.   Lisa Tuttle: "Everyman's Library"  (London: J.M. Dent & Co.)   Gordon Van Gelder: The hardcover of A GENTLE MADNESS by Nicholas Basbanes (Holt)   Ellen Datlow: _Coraline_ by Neil Gaiman with illustrations by Dave McKean. --    Do you have any memory connected to books that you would like to share?   Jack Dann: One of my earliest memories of reading was that when I opened a book, all the characters would come alive; when I closed it, they would go to sleep. On some level, I still believe that.  Jeff Topham: About 10 years ago, my then-girlfriend and I spent two delirious months on a rambling cross-country road trip. The only book I brought was Tom Robbins' Another Roadside Attraction, whose endpapers, and eventually even its margins, became filled with my travel journal. It traveled with me to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It was soaked during a thunderstorm at Glacier National Park. Its front cover was singed during a hilariously inept attempt to smoke a small amount of opium we'd bought. It is a ruin of a book. It is priceless to me.

      Readers of my Ambergris stories who do not live in Florida, or who have only visited Florida's tourist attractions, often wonder how Florida could possibly have influenced me. In fact, the decay and proliferating fungi of Ambergris are elements also inherent to Florida. I live in Tallahassee, in the north of the state, about 45 minutes away, by car, from any hint of coastline. In the summers here, the humidity level hovers around 100 percent. The temperature is consistently 90 to 95 degrees F. The rain, for a couple of months at least, is near constant, and often ferocious. (A friend of ours from England told us that the first time he experienced Florida rain, he stopped his car from shock; he was used to the constant mist of England, not this torrential downpour.)  In such a climate, the rate of decay, the infiltration of insects, the appearance of fungi and lichen, are all accelerated. If our modern civilization stopped functioning for just four months during the summer--no pest control, no air conditioning, no lawnmowers--Florida would revert to a natural state far more swiftly than anyone might think.  We're in the heart of the summer now, and the vegetation around our house is defiantly green, richly green--one might almost say "verdant." The azalea bushes that surround our yard like a thick fence have long since bloomed, the watery fire of their blossoms snuffed out. The only colors now are greens and browns and white--the greens of grass, trees, and lichen; the brown of soil, of rotted twigs and branches, of tree trunks; the white of tiny mushrooms circling the decay. Our backyard has long been mostly compost pile, with a thick surface of brown leaves on top. Through this the mushrooms sometimes appear, like little sentinels. The half decomposed limbs of fallen branches are thick with lichen--a rich, green color that calls to mind the endpapers of old Victorian novels. The insects are everywhere, especially at night--great, awkward flying beetles like dreadnaughts, and tiny, ephemeral whispy things with legs like pencil lead, and moths like drab paupers circling the globe of our outdoor light. (Sometimes we see damselflies, more delicate than dragonflies, and unable to survive except at certain elevations, in certain types of humidity; they are black and shiny and velvety, but they move like drunken sailors.) Below the surface: earthworms, cockroaches rustling through the dead leaves. Above: thrashers, thrushes, wrens, blue jays, crows, and squirrels. At night, frogs will stick to the windows and we will watch their tiny pink-and-white throats shiver and pulse with life. At night, while you are trying to become the opposite of awake, you will hear the chorus of the frogs, which bark, and the chorus of the cicadas, which sound like tiny drills, and the chorus of the crickets, which sound as if they are trying to soothe both the frogs and cicadas to sleep.  We have one enormous, tall tree in the front yard. The biggest wisteria vine I have ever seen winds its way around the tree all the way to the top. I used to think that the tree and the wisteria were locked in decades-slow combat, a battle that might not end until long after I was dead. But lately I have begun to suspect that the tree and the wisteria are locked in an embrace. It is a decades-slow love story, which will reach its fruition long after I am dead.  When the wisteria blooms, it covers our cars, using the rain to stick to the doors, the roof, the windows, so that over time, if we are not careful, they are transformed into Mardi Gras floats. Their blossoms fall onto the grass and leaves. They become brown, shapeless, rotting into the ground, like everything else.  Ambergris is but a pale reflection of this...  JeffV

      Who are these new writers--either new because young or new because not fully noticed before (or "new" because I got lazy and didn't keep up with my reading)--that are combining influences in new ways, cross-pollinating fiction, or renovating it, or just writing great stuff? Here are a few who have caught my eye:  Alan DeNiro Shelley Jackson Nick Mamatas Alex Irvine (yeah,  I know everyone else already noticed him) Michael Cisco (it's a pet peeve of mine that he's not better known) K.J. Bishop Jay Lake Alan Wall (well, it doesn't take a divining rod to pick him) Ian R. McLeod (under-appreciated because he takes his time writing his novels, and gets them right)  Check out their work, if you haven't already. I think it's likely, though, that I've simply come a little late to the dinner table, so to speak.  JeffV

      Two very cool book-things arrived in the mailbox-thing yesterday-- Child Assassin by Alan DeNiro  and  The Frank Book by Jim Woodring .  Child Assassin by DeNiro is a Small Alice thing--part of a series called  urlLink One Story ; literally, a small-sized chapbook containing one story, with a simple yet beautiful design. One Story puts out 18 of these chapbooks a year. DeNiro's story is an unclassifiable surreal thing with lines like "No one knew what to call him, which suited him perfectly well, because he liked to kill babies, and it was better not to have a name attached to such acts." and "The sale of security products to orphanages spiked dramatically whenever he drifted through a town. He knew this, and himself dreamed about being caught and eaten by high-level bureaucrats." I like the story a lot--despite a hiccup of banality in the middle involving turn-about on the assassin, because it ends in the same strange place it begins. You can subscribe to One Story via the Internet--I know I'm planning to.  The Frank Book by Jim Woodring is a Large Alice thing--it collects all of Woodring's Frank cartoons in an oversized omnibus hardcover of almost 400 pages, with several series of full-color plates. At first, I thought the most surreal thing about Frank might be the introduction by Francis Ford Coppola, possibly the last person I'd think of to do the honors. Frank has no captions and no dialogue, forcing you to concentrate on the truly surreal, insane panels and storylines. Frank is a cat-thing who wanders through a constantly metamorphosizing landscape that includes twirling fleshy flying things (you can pull open their marsupial pouches and take a ride), a manhog thing whose adventures are pitiable and disturbing, a faithful sidekick thing with a Chershire Cat tail who otherwise looks a little like a flesh-toaster, and a spindly Devil-creature thing named Whim who operates to the tune of his own perverse logic. I've never read anything like this, and recommend it highly. Thanks to Eric Schaller for recommending it to me.  Now, I just need to find an Alice Medium-Sized thing (which might just be the new Caustic Resin CD).

      I've been working steadily on the rewrite of my new novel, SHRIEK: AN AFTERWORD for the past week, and marveling at how the imagination and the subconscious can work together to revitalize material I'd looked over maybe 20 times and been unable, in the past, to see fault in. You get a sense of snow blindness, and even a sense of disgust at your work over time. You become so familiar with it that it's like something dead--inert stone or dirt. Luckily, a little bit of time away from the manuscript seems to have helped quite a bit. Also, finishing the first draft (although parts of it are about seventh draft now) helped immeasurably. Now that I know how the story ends, I know how the light strikes the words in the earlier parts, if that makes any sense. There's a sudden fleshing out, a three-dimensional quality that I can infuse the words with due to the foreknowledge of the ending.  Anyway, I may be somewhat intermittent on this already intermittent blog for at least eight weeks as I get deeper and deeper into this thing.  JeffV

      After compiling responses over the course of the last two years, in my "spare time," the entire five-question book survey is now going live on  urlLink Fantastic Metropolis . Over 70 writers and editors responded, including Michael Chabon, Milorad Pavic, Gene Wolfe, Shelley Jackson, etc., etc.--just too many to mention. Please check it out--it's vastly entertaining. Meanwhile, my own responses to the five questions can be found below.  JeffV    What do you most like about the book as a physical object?  I love how each part of a book, from exterior to interior, can become a work of art. I love how a well-made book is both like a well-made cabinet and like a stunning painting: it simultaneously provides some of the satisfaction of physical exertion and the aesthetics of art. The craft that goes into a well-made book is fascinating to me.   Do you have any rituals or procedures you go through after acquiring a new (or used) book? (Some writers indicate they bite or smell books.)  I read all of the front and end matter first. I'll perhaps read a page or two here or there to get a sense for the prose style. If it's a hardcover, I'll put a plastic protective cover on it immediately. I'll take the dust jacket off and see if there's a foil stamp on the cover. If it's one of my books, I will carry it with me everywhere like a talisman for a week or two, marveling all over again at the fact that I have a book in print--something I never thought of as a given. I like to thoroughly enjoy each new book when first published…I usually don't smell my books--smell is not a big deal for me when it comes to books, but I do hate the smell of cigarettes emanating from a used book, or an antiseptic smell. Mustiness is just fine, however.   Is it necessary for books to exist as physical objects in our increasingly electronic world? If so, why?  For me, it's necessary. I am so invested in not only the text of a book but the way a book is put together that I would find a world without hardcopy books much poorer and less interesting. It's instinctual.   What recent examples stand out for you as exemplar of well-designed, well-made books?  Savoy Books continues to put out amazing books, including their recent A Voyage to Arcturus edition, which is one of the best designed books I've ever seen. I almost very much liked House of Leaves when it came out in 2000. I'm a sucker for anything published by Tartarus or Dedalus, although Dedalus books are not collectable per se. I also very much like the first volume of collected Hodgson from Night Shade Books. Anything from McSweeney's tends to be interesting--sometimes "clever" wins out over "substance," but it's always interesting. When PS Publishing does something crazy like publish a book with no text on the cover, just art, I always smile and applaud their daring. Usually, they know just when to do that, the art deserving to be center stage.   Do you have any memory connected to books that you would like to share?  Several books are dear to me because they triggered an emotional response I wasn't expecting, because they revealed some truth to me in a very profound way. The World According to Garp by Irving and The Chess Garden by Brooks Hansen are two books that gave me a reading experience I'll never forget. As a writer, I'll never forget reading Angela Carter's The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman. Her use of language was so amazing that I felt like my eyes were burning from the "touch" of the words against my vision. I actually cried out in amazement at times while reading it because the use of language was so brilliant. Much earlier, the last book of The Lord of the Rings had a profound effect on me because Tolkien, despite faults that are apparent when I re-read the books now, never let his characters off the hook--they suffer terribly to attain their desires, and even afterwards they are not safe, as when Saruman takes over the Shire. This idea that characters, like real people, cannot "get off the hook" easily resonated with me to the point that Tolkien, like Stephen R. Donaldson, with his Thomas Covenant series, was a huge influence on my early fiction. A story like "The Bone-Carver's Tale," for example, could not have existed without that lesson.

      I think I may have begun to disappear up my own arse with that last posting. I plan to return to the topic, but only when I have time to address it in more depth and with more coherence.  In the meantime, I've been reading Jose Saramago's All the Names and enjoying it immensely. It is a chronicle of a clerk in the Central Registry, charged with keeping track of files on the living and the dead. One particular quote stood out for me in the early pages:  "The state of neglect grew, dereliction prospered, uncertainty multiplied, so much so that one day...a researcher became lost in the labyrinthine catacombs of the archive of the dead, having come to the Central Registry in order to carry out some genealogical research he had been commissioned to undertake. He was discovered, almost miraculously, after a week, starving, thirsty, exhausted, delirious, having survived thanks to the desperate measures of ingesting enormous quantities of old documents which neither lingered in the stomach nor nourished, since they melted in the mouth without requiring any chewing."  I don't know if the book becomes fantastical later in the sense of events occurring that could not occur in the real world, but if not, I'd still consider the book fantasy on the level of metaphor for descriptions like that.

      I've already established in a prior blog post that I believe all fiction is fantasy in a sense. As a result, all fiction is "escapist" in a sense--there are simply varying degrees of escapism. The importance of this distinction, to me, is not to buy into the untruth ("lie" is perhaps too harsh a word in this context) that any writer of fiction is not being "escapist" in some way. For one thing, it allows us to see the worth of truly escapist fiction by allowing it to exist in the same continuum, within the same spectrum. "Escapist" should not be a pejorative, in other words. Fiction can fail in so many ways that to focus on "too much escapism" strikes me as a convenient way to overlook defects in "non-escapist" fantasy, for example.  But what I really want to discuss in this post is how postmodern techniques in fantasy fiction often actually  supports  the "fantasy" element, if we, for purposes of this discussion, define "fantasy" as "containing non-real-world elements"--a non-Earth Prime setting, for example. I'll use my own "fantastical" setting of Ambergris for purposes of illustration. My "mosaic novel" or short story collection City of Saints contains quite a bit of postmodern technique, applied with varying degrees of depth. Most of it serves to support the reality of the fantasy setting--"King Squid" and "The Early History of Ambergris," for example, use the structure of nonfiction forms for fictional purposes. In "Early History" the "fictional purpose" is to present a history of Ambergris without the need for the traditional methods of plot and character development. This device strengthens the conceit of Ambergris being real, rather than in any way disabusing the reader of his or her suspension of disbelief.  In "King Squid," the structure used is that of the scientific monograph. "King Squid" sets out the delusions of a supposed resident of Ambergris--in other words, most everything set out in the monograph is false to the supposed "truth" (or Reality2) of Ambergris ("our world" being Reality1). In a sense, the structure of "King Squid" allows the narrator his delusions but denies him the escape one might expect is inherent in a "fantasy" setting. Its effect on the reader is to uphold the reality of Ambergris because the reader is forced to conclude that the "facts" about Ambergris set out in the piece are either distorted or untrue--in a sense, it forces the reader to consider Ambergris as real and the "King Squid" story as false.  Other postmodern techniques I use do, in fact, breach the wall between author and reader, and expose the "lie" of suspension of disbelief. More on them later. My main point here, I suppose, in what has become a somewhat rambling yet truncated post that will probably require revision, is that a postmodern technique used in a "fantastical setting" often supports the milieu, even if those same techniques used with a modern-day setting can seem artificial or distracting from the reality of place.

      This weekend, I went up to Jacksonville, Florida, with some friends (Pete Peterson and Scott Stratton--fully incorporated into Ambergris as some of you may recognize) to visit the used bookstores. Jacksonville is pretty amazing when it comes to bookstores. If you just counted Chambline's Bookmine (for my money, the best used bookstore I've ever visited) and Tappin's Bookmine, it'd be worth the trip, but when you throw in the other four or five excellent used bookstores--and the proximity of St. Augustine, with another four or five excellent bookstores--it's something of a book lover's paradise.  The books I picked up this time, in the jumbled order in which I discovered them, included:  Barrow's Boys by Fergus Fleming (hc 1st ed; history of British exploration through those sent out to map the unknown in the late 1800s; many never came back)  The Rise and Fall of the British Empire by Lawrence James (hc 1st ed; history)  Nature Writing edited by Robert Finch and John Elder (hc; nature writing samples from the 1800s to the present)  A Taste for Travel by John Julius Norwich (hc 1st ed; travel writing samples with notes and additional text from Norwich; I now lack only one Norwich book for my collection--his book on sex in the ancient world, which is probably required reading before I start the novel after the one I'm currently working on)  Vermillion Sea by John Janovy Jr. (hc; nature writing about the coast of California)  Stars of the Unborn by Franz Werfel (mmpb; a novel from early in the 20th century by a resident of Prague, published in the Ballantine adult fantasy line, with an admiring quote on the cover by Henry Miller!)  Modern Classics of Fantasy edited by Gardner Dozois (hc 1st ed; this St. Martin's collection has several long stories that my eyes have somehow managed to be innocent of to this point...)  Little Big by John Crowley (hc; the trade paperback has been difficult for me to read--this version is slightly more readable in terms of the typeface)  The Great Wheel by Ian R. McLeod (hc 1st ed; this novel by the author of the Light Ages looks, in some ways, even better than Light Ages)  The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis by Jose Saramago (tp; Nobel Prize-winning Portuguese novelist; I've been meaning to check him out for some time)  All the Lines by Jose Saramago (tp; this book was recommended to me by the owner (?) of Anastasia Books in St. Augustine, a very knowledgeable person who had had Marquez as an instructor at the University of Massachusetts while an undergraduate...but she also claimed to have taken the Scientologist test on a lark...)  The Sooterkin by Tom Gilling (tp; a changeling fantasy published in the mainstream that looks interesting)  One Step Behind by Henning Mankell (tp; a friend recommended Mankell to me as exemplar of excellent modern European mystery/detective novels)  Faceless Killers by Henning Mankell (tp)  The White Lionness by Henning Mankell (tp)  Daemonology by John Crowley (tp; again, the tp's of his work are okay re the typeface, but not really that reader-friendly; he really needs Everyman Library-type hardcover editions with better leading, better selection of font, and a more soothing number of words per line; this is not throw-away fiction, and the reader must really concentrate to get the full value out of that; eyestrain is not conducive to concentration)  Cathedral of the World by Myron Aims (tp; a meditation and dialogue on the sea; could be New Age crap; might be excellent; time will tell...)  Platypus by Ann Moyal (hc 1st ed; sumptuously illustrated and satisfying eccentric; in fact, it's entirely possible that the platypus will, as Mike Moorcock puts it, become my next "totem animal")  Travelers and Travel Liars, 1660-1800 by Percy G. Adams (tp; another of the rather miraculous finds made years by the Dover Books people)  Bad Trips edited by Keith Fraser (tp; I'm a sucker for tales of trips gone wrong)  The Inland Sea by Donald Richie (mmpb; looks like an interesting account of Japanese culture)  Their Heads are Green and Their Hands are Blue by Paul Bowles (tp; about Morocco and North African culture; looks fascinating)  Great French Short Novels edited by F.W. Dupel (hc; I haven't read a single novel in this omnibus; very much looking forward to it)  Great Russian Short Novels edited by Philip Rahv (hc; more familiar territory, but still a few I haven't read; I also can really identify with the term "short novels" ;) )  Stand on Zanzibar by John Brunner (hc, Easton Press edition; I've wanted a thick, virtually indestructible version of this for quite some time; now, if only the horrible illustrations inside would self-destruct...)  Light Metres illustrated by Edward Gorey (hc limited, signed copy #50 of 300 copies; I just couldn't resist this one, pricey but worth it.  Time Buried by Howard Wandrei (hc; Fegoman & Bremer; Lovecraft contemporary; most of the stories look cheesey, but the edition itself is gorgeous with cover art that somehow evokes Arthur Rackham)  The Eerie Mr. Murphy by Howard Wandrei (hc; volume 2 of his fantasy stories)  The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer by Chaucer (oversized hc facsimile of the William Morris original, just too beautiful to pass up; I got this at the Tappin Bookmine, and they also had a single page from the Morris original, selling for $1,200; the page was unbelievably gorgeous; the facsimile book is stunning, too)  Venice Art & Architecture (oversized hc two-vol. set in slipcase; this completes my acquisition of books about Venice, which began with John Julius Norwich's history of the city; my main focus is on the influence of Constantinople on Venice)  On Friday, Pete and I headed over to  St. Augustine first, met by Scott in Jacksonville later that night. In St. Augustine, Jackelyn at the Anastasia Bookstore recommended Saramago to me and gently teased me for asking for travel essays: "you mean, so you don't have to go there yourself?" The graybeards at Wolf's Head and Avenue Books kept their own counsel, distinguished grayhaired women answering our questions. In all three places, one felt oneself in the presence of repositories of great knowledge and of the kind of eccentricity that really deserves further exploration. A journey to another place, even one as close as Jacksonville is to Tallahassee, leaves you with a tantalizing glimpse of what it might be like to live in a town with more than one good used bookstore.  In Jacksonville the next day, after a pleasant night of drinking, talking, and smoking a very nice cigar, Chamblin's Bookmine awaited us early in the morning. Chamblin's is a massive bookstore--truly a book mine in every sense of the word. Aisles and aisles and aisles bristling with books, hundreds of boxes partially blocking your way, and completely filled with customers on a Saturday morning. People come from as far away as North Carolina to visit Chamblin's, and it's easy to see why, even just in terms of what they bought from me. I brought in three big boxes of books, and they took almost everything. This sounds like a lack of taste on their part. What it really is is a completist approach to establishing a bookstore inventory. Anyone who likes any kind of book can come to Chamblin's and find a wide selection of that type--again, no matter what type it is. Their SF/Fantasy paperback selection is amazing. Their travel book selection is amazing. Their history section is amazing. Their mysteries, their cookbooks, their biographies--each section is huge, and you will find at least one rare thing you wanted or one thing you didn't know existed that is perfect for you. When you then throw in their rare and collectible books...it's truly an experience. The staff is also always courteous and knowledgeable.  Tappin's Bookmine is also impressive, although more selective. A much smaller store, it nonetheless contained as many treasures as Chamblin's, including the Chaucer/Morris facsimile I bought and one of the Wandrei's. There, the proprietor also brought out a $12,000 first American edition of The Hobbit with color plates by Tolkien. It had originally be bought when the novel first came out as a present for a daughter. The daughter, now grown up (by many years!), had decided to sell it.  But perhaps the most amazing find at Tappin's were books that the owner was still pricing--old hardcover pulp SF novels in the Lensmen series, Jack Williamson, etc. Most of them were signed and some were numbered. Some had very long inscriptions. A wino had brought them in--he'd found them in a dumpster and indicated there were more. As they now admit, they made the mistake of paying the man for all of the books he'd brought in rather than half then, half upon getting more info about where he'd found them--he promptly disappeared and no one ever located the dumpster where some uninformed person had tossed all of these invaluable books.  Then it was on to Jerry's, a bookstore that now looks like the kind of place Kurtz from Heart of Darkness would run if he ran a bookstore. Pete, Scott, and I could have sworn the unopened boxes of books right smack in the middle of the carpet were the same boxes from a year earlier. Only, another 12 to 20 boxes had joined them. You couldn't even reach over them to get to the bookcases with the limited edition and first edition SF and Fantasy. It appeared that the whole store had, in a sense, "gone native." Jerry was his old feisty self, however, ready to engage in any discussion involving SF and Fantasy.  And, interestingly enough, a book Pete found--The Castle of the Otter--shed perhaps a little light on the Gene Wolfe Odyssey workshop fiasco. The book is nonfiction Wolfe wrote about his Shadow of the Torturer series, the title taken from a misprint Locus magazine made when reporting the New Sun books Wolfe was working on (i.e., "Castle of the Otter" instead of "Citadel of the Autarch"). In the book, Wolfe interviews himself, and has this to say about workshops:  A: In 1975, I taught a week at the Clarion Writer's Conference at Michigan State. Q: Was it fun? A: Not really, although I met three people who have become more or less permanent friends. On the whole, the students were mainly interested in smoking dope and meeting celebrities. I don't smoke and I'm not a celebrity. Q: Weren't you ever asked to come back? A: Yes, but only after six years, when there was a new faculty advisor. Q: Did you go? A: No. Q: Are you ever going to try teaching again? A: Perhaps, if I find somebody who wants to learn. Writers tend to think that everybody wants to learn to write. The truth is, very few do, and that most of those who do succeed. Most people don't take the time and trouble... Q: Teaching doesn't seem to have been very much fun for you.  As it was, so it shall be, apparently...  There is not much else left to tell. Pete, Scott, and I all came back loaded down with books, with leads about other books, with glimpses of books we could not afford to buy, or could not rationalize the decision to buy, and the glimmer of the next bookstore trip already a pleasant if distant thought in the back of our minds.

      There has been a certain amount of debate about escapist versus non-escapist fantasy that I think would be better discussed in the context of escapist versus non-escapist  fiction .  First, though, I think it's important to reaffirm a very basic concept:  All  fiction is fantasy, on one level. No matter how "realistic" the fiction, it contains  some  element either in a different context than it occurs in the real world or an element of the imagination brought in by the writer that has only a loose association with reality. To me, this seems like a rather safe and in some ways banal assumption.   In addition, however, I believe all fiction is fantasy because in one way or another fiction  disappoints  reality. No fiction can adequately describe even the interior of, say, a bookstore in such a way as to render it as real, on the level of specific detail, as  you  do when you visit said bookstore.  To some extent, then,  all  fiction is escapist, regardless of how grimly real. And in this sense, "escapist" means "untrue." Thus, fiction can either be  more  or  less  escapist--it cannot be other than escapist, because it is, on the face of it, false to reality in some way, no matter how minor or major that way might be...(My own fiction often deals with the failure or the success of the imagination to transcend reality, or to transform reality, which fits into this discussion in a way that requires its own mini-essay in future.)  If you accept my argument above, then postmodern technique, by insisting that the reader face the reality that all fiction is fantasy (suspension of disbelief overruled), is in a sense  less  escapist than purely modernist fiction. By the same measure, postmodern fiction containing a "fantasy" element (for fantasy element, read: an event or person that could not exist in the "real" world in any sense) or fantasy containing a postmodern element, is thus the  least  escapist of all types of Fantasy (here I use the term fantasy as a publisher would label-wise, just for the sake of the hypothetical).  How does this impact the current debates in the fantasy field. First, a China Mieville novel with a milieu in which Marxist or Socialist society may be the norm is no more or less escapist than J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy of pastoral bliss threatened by industrialization. Ian R. MacLeod's The Light Ages, in which a socialist revolution fails, is also not any more or less escapist in the sense that, no postmodern technique being employed, the reader is still allowed to escape into the fiction of "suspending disbelief." And M. John Harrison's "forgiveness" of fantasy in his last short story collection by changing "A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium" to "A Young Man's Journey to London" does not in any sense change the escapist element or lack thereof, no matter how important that title change (and thus emphasis change) is to Harrison himself. (Whether he is describing London or an entry-point to the fantastic Viriconium, Harrison is still describing a place that exists only in his head.)  All of which is by way of actually saying--I don't know how useful it is to talk about escapist versus non-escapist fantasy. I am not claiming that postmodern fantasy is superior--just that the existence of postmodern fantasy allows for arguments like the above. Perhaps "escapist fantasy", or a degree of it, should not be dismissed so readily, considering that most everyone writing today is engaging in it. ;)  (This is a musing in progress, so no brickbats.)

      As I become an old man, succumbing to sudden bouts of Halfheimer's, unable to distinguish day from night, as liable to leave my false teeth in the garden as in a cup in the sink, the misty veils of memory serve to deceive me. I held an odd job  before  Y Publications (as set forth in Odd Jobs #2), and managed to forget about it between taking the geritol and looking for my cane.  How could I forget Book Warehouse, in Gainesville, Florida? Thou fetid breath of stale air, thou cement strip-mall fixture, glassy face fixed on the dull gray lifeless strip that is Interstate 75, yearning for customers. Or something like that. I shall stop waxing poetic before I wax myself right into purpling prose. Too late.  Book Warehouse: a remaindered books bookstore. Or as I like to think of it, a remaindered bookstore. I worked there for six months, under certain constraints. Like, we had to accost the customer before they'd taken ten steps into the store, asking "How" or "What" questions so they could not simply answer "No" and continue about their business. Like, if someone asked for a book that we did not have--and the truth was: we did not have any books that anybody wanted; chastened, embarrassed authors of non-sellers clustered on the shelves, trying to hide--we should not  tell  them we didn't have the book; instead, we should immediately suggest an alternative book that was  like  the book they had asked for, in hopes they would buy it instead. Invariably, this failed with miserable frequency. "Do you have the novelization of  Terminator ?" "No, but we have a novelization of  Monkey Boy Wonder Bus . Would that do?"  By day, our district manager worked in the prison system testing urine samples from potential guards. At night, he came by with his brilliant ideas. Under his guidance, we would desperately find new ways to sell the books. For example, we once changed the alphabetical order of the entire wall of fiction from A - Z to Z - A. Another time, we had to reorganize the Wall of Fiction so that it formed a pretty pattern of dark covers and light covers. Perhaps, in time, we would have played chess with the Wall of Fiction. It certainly wasn't going anywhere, and had nothing else to do.  Once, our district manager took it upon himself to show us the proper way to display the books. When he was done, he turned, started to speak, and a coffee table book he'd shelved improperly fell on his head.  Another time, he took me aside and asked, with a twinned tone of urgency and puzzlement in his voice, "That woman was just in here last week. Why is she here again?" I didn't really know how to answer the question. "What do you mean? She wants to buy more books." Him: "But she just bought one last week." And so the conversation continued, until it became quite clear that our district manager viewed books like the rest of us thought of toasters, microwaves, televisions, drill sets, end tables, couches, spatulas, egg whisks, tractors, cheese graters, porch swings, and other things one does not buy each and every week.  Customers added to the fun. Once, we discovered that someone had taped condoms inside each and every copy of a popular teen romance series. Another time, we caught a self-published author trying to sneak his book onto the shelves. In a remaindered bookstore.  Of course, I was not blameless. Sometimes, I did not make what one might call the "right decisions." For example, I once led a man to a book on airplanes when what he wanted was The Great Plains.  But my most horrible miscalculation concerned the young adult mystery section.  A girl came in asking for mysteries. I led her to the young adult mystery section. It was in the awkward silence that followed that I realized she was not a girl. She was a midget. I quickly led her to the right section and then went into the back room so I could bang my head against a wall for awhile. A blunder of legendary proportions. I couldn't bear to come out until after she was gone.  But it would get worse. The next day things were slow, so I was telling a co-worker in a self-deprecating way, about the whole midget-young-adult debacle. Suddenly, I hear a sharp cough from somewhere near my elbow. I look down-- and there's a man, a dwarf, glaring up at me.  Stunned, I asked him a "How" or "What" question and then tried to stumble through an explanation, before just shutting up.  Rather shaken by the confluence, I decided I'd stick to pricing the new books that were due to come in that day, and let my co-worker take the register. By that time, I had been made an Assistant Manager, which meant I got a five cent per hour raise and could tell the only other person who worked my shift to man the register.  So I go out back to the truck when it pulls up, to show the driver where to put the boxes...and it's not the normal driver. It's another dwarf. A midget and two dwarfs in a day and half. Someone somewhere was trying to tell me something--and I have to say, I was  sincerely sorry  for my lack of attention to detail re the young adult mystery section. I really was. It wasn't like I had a prejudice against little people--my tutor in math in college had been a dwarf, and if not for him I would have gotten an F rather than a D.  Nonetheless, the writing was clearly on the wall, as they say. These signs and symbols meant I could not be long for Book Warehouse, and so it turned out to be.  Having complained about the raise in responsibilities without a commensurate raise in salary--besides the five cents per hour, which, coincidentally, put me five cents above the minimum wage at that time--Book Warehouse fired me.  I'd soon regroup with Y Publications, and in the intervening two months of unemployment, I wrote "Learning to Leave the Flesh," about a dwarf, and "Bone Carver's Tale," two of my best pieces. (I wrote a story about a bookstore, but it sucked.) But I'd never forget my stint at Book Warehouse, workin' for the man.  Looking back, there are three things I learned from working at Book Warehouse: (1) pay attention to who you are leading to the young adult mystery section, (2) spreading a rumor that the owner of Book Warehouse has "changed her name to Mrs. Book Warehouse out of loyalty to the company" may not endear you to management, and (3) lighter fluid is the best way to remove price labels without leaving sticky glue on a book cover.  Now, I have to swallow down some more geritol and go take a nap. Please excuse me.  Jeff   Next time on Odd Jobs: A fist through a bathroom wall, making firearms in your basement, and a flying frog tile almost decapitates me. Or, "the joy of working on city ordinances."

      Editing anthologies is a very instinctual skill for me, not something bloodlessly objective. It may not be that way for others.  For me, it has its analogies to the way I write. Just as I feel my way into a short story I'm writing through the texture and tone of the language, so too I feel my way into a story I'm reading for an anthology--if the story allows that to happen; if it doesn't, I know the story's not for me. If the language is blunt where it should be subtle, or subtle where it should be blunt; if the choice of words does not in some way reveal care with language, then I cannot sneak my way beneath the story's surface, and I know it's not a story traveling anywhere I want to go.  Just like with my writing, I take certain things on faith. Sometimes I do not fully understand why I made a choice I made in a work of fiction. Eventually, it becomes clear, but not always right away. The same thing often occurs when reading for an anthology, in that sometimes I will not immediately understand a story but still feel that it is  right . That the story has integrity and makes internal sense, even if that sense cannot immediately be extracted from the story. In extreme cases, where the story's structure and language are so perfect, if oblique, that it feels as if the fault is mine not the story's, I may take a story I still do not fully understand. Ursula Pflug's "Python" in Album Zutique #1 is a good example of a story of this type. Not until after I read it in the published form did the story finally make sense to me.  Am I crazy to take a story I don't understand? On some level, perhaps the answer is yes. But I have a great faith in the subconscious workings of the mind, and when you feel something is right in your reptile brain, eventually you will know why with your conscious mind. The other factor is that I feel impoverished, starving, if I read too many stories where I understand everything right away. Either it is a failing in the story or in me, in such cases. To only come to the full meaning of a story late, and after several re-readings can indicate a story that fully deserved one's repeated attention. (Of course, it can also mean the story failed.) When we predominantly think of the story as "entertainment," we deny the ability of a story to get deep into our souls and burrow there, to take hold of us in unexpected and stunning ways.  Another way in which editing anthologies is like writing fiction, for me, is that I always want my reach to exceed my grasp--only in that way can I continue to grow and improve. It leads sometimes to failed experiments, it leads to utter catastrophe at times, but it also means you travel farther than you would have if you'd tried for less.  For this reason, anthologies I edit are almost always going to be baggy, thick, confrontational, multi-faceted creations. I'm always going to take stories I think push boundaries, for better or worse, whether readers or reviewers ultimately think that the results are not always successful. I don't suggest this is a better or worse way of editing than other approaches. I'm not advocating any kind of semi-mystical approach, either. I'm just saying that this is one of the only ways to really push yourself.  There are thousands of replicas out there that don't realize they are replicas. Why knowingly be one of them?

      Another odd job I held was as a glorified secretary and editor for Y Publications in Gainesville, Florida. Dr. X ran the business, which produced sample tests in book form for accountants and airplane pilots who wanted to get certain certifications. Why accountants and airplane pilots? Because Dr. X just happened to be both. My first duty at Y was to transcribe the seemingly endless tapes Dr. X made day and night--whether in his office or at home or on the road. He had a little mini tape recorder he took with him everywhere.  So, I would transcribe his thoughts, ideas, and letters every day. After I finished, I'd work on copy editing of the various manuals.  Dr. X was a curious creature, who liked to wear striped shirts and these thick, 1950s dark-framed glasses. He needed little sleep. He had no social graces--or, rather, could turn them on when needed, but for the most part was sharply direct, sometimes to the point of rudeness. I can remember more than one time that I would come into the office and he would be at his desk in his boxers, having spent the night in the building so as to work on some new idea.  Ideas were always sparking off of Dr. X. One time, I remember, I was merrily transcribing away when I heard him say, "Jeff, I want to see about promoting the use of small aircraft. Some kind of campaign. Get someone like Michael Jackson. We'll do ads." So, for a short time, it was my job to try to get hold of Michael Jackson so he could possibly endorse the use of small aircraft.  But it is the complaints I enjoyed the most. If Taco Bell shorted him a taco shell on a to-go order, he'd have me draft a letter to the president of Taco Bell asking for the extra shell. If his frozen fish sticks had a couple of black charred bits in the box, he'd write to the head of the company that made them, enclosing the charred bits and asking for a refund. I *think* the letters actually got sent, but there's always the possibility he was pulling my leg.  Over time, I got to transcribe some of the most amazingly bizarre letters anyone has ever sent anywhere.  Not to mention, Dr. X had a father who had been an inventor of some sort, and who now, looking a bit like Baron Munchausen, would dotter into the office holding a rough diagram and some scribbled words on a legal sheet or a napkin or god knows what, whereupon it would be my job to render it all accurately (and with some semblance of sense) into a WordPerfect document.  Those were the days. I actually took to using a mini-tape recorder myself and dictating my own story ideas into it, then transcribing them on my lunch break. But it was too much of a pain in the ass, so I went back to scribbling notes.  Working at Y for Dr. X was interesting, to say the least. It certainly wasn't the strangest job I've ever had, though, because Dr. X was just eccentric, living in his own world. He wasn't psychotic, he wasn't mean, just brusque. And from him I learned to have a great work ethic, because he himself had a monstrous work ethic that seemed to just about devour his life.  But I will never forget having to try to get hold of Michael Jackson to have him promote the use of small aircraft.  Jeff

       Interstitial Arts:   art made in the interstices between genres and categories. Art that flourishes in the borderlands between disciplines, mediums, and cultures. Art that blurs the divide between fine art and craft, high art and low. Art that crosses boundaries. Artists without borders.    For a long time now, a sea change has been occurring in the world of fiction. Cross-pollination has, more and more, become an element of the best fiction. These cross-genre approaches were around in the 1990s (and before), but it is only lately that a real renaissance has come about—not just in the number of excellent writers unafraid of crossing borders and boundaries, but also in the number of readers attracted to this kind of work. Fantasy has bled into the mainstream, and vice versa. Among other approaches, experimental techniques from the 1960s (both from the New Wave and the Post Moderns) have been redeployed for either true innovation or for strategic “renovations” that have become new in their own right.  Writers are mixing and matching genres with bewildering, wonderful frequency. For this reason, I personally have been against any single attempt to put a name to these often disparate proto-movements. It has seemed to me that such a naming puts a limit, a boundary, on writers and on individual works.  However, I believe that a new term—“interstitial” (interstial art/literature/music)—has captured not just the moment but the nature of this sea change in fiction. The word “interstitial,” or the term “interstitial arts,” may not slide off the tongue with ease. It may, at first glance, seem too generic, as amorphous in definition as “slipstream.” But a closer look at the term reveals that it strikes just the right balance between too specific and too vague. Any more specific and the term would become as much of a straitjacket as those terms used to describe movements. Any less specific and the term would not be meaningful for classification purposes, or for the more important purposes of dialogue about the arts.  The initial proponents of interstitial art include Heinz Insu Fenkl, Terri Windling, and Delia Sherman. As “founders” of the idea, they can express better than I can what it means in its purest form—and luckily their intelligent, well-thought-out, and fascinating takes on the subject can now be read on the  urlLink Interstitial Web Site .  I recommend reading through all of the information on the site. For purposes of this blog, however, I would like to excerpt and comment on two of the pieces to be found there: Delia Sherman’s  urlLink “An Introduction to Interstitial Arts: Life on the Border”  and Heinz Insu Fenkl’s  urlLink “Towards a Theory of the Interstitial.”  Both essays represent the beginning of an ongoing dialogue about the term, and about the work the term represents.  Sherman writes:  “Interstitial fiction defies categories and laughs at expectation; Interstitial fiction breaks the rules. Interstitial novels lurk near or on the borders of two, three, or more genres, owing allegiance to no single genre or set of conventions…Take Angela Carter, whose free and easy way with literary conventions surely makes her the Patron Saint of Interstitial writers. Nights at the Circus is part fairy-tale, part historical, part picaresque adventure, part circus story, part meditation on truth and reality. Wise Children draws its background from Hollywood history, its structure from the comedies of Shakespeare and Terence, and its characters from Charles Dickens. These books may have been published as Mainstream, but they swim against the current of that stream with every sentence. Similarly, T. Coraghessan Boyle's exuberant Water Music is equally Historical fiction, Literary Satire, and Magic Realism. Toni Morrison's Beloved owes as much to Fantasy as Historical Fiction or African-American fiction. And Historical fiction is not the only genre that often turns to the conventions of other genres. Many of P.D. James' mysteries are distinctly more concerned with Literary Realism subjects of class, religion, and the state of Detective Dalgliesh's soul than with the progress of his investigation. Tony Hillerman's Navaho detectives often have one foot in the spirit world. Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove is a serious historical novel in Western's clothing.”  These examples add a layer of specific detail to the definition of “interstitial arts” as applicable to literature. They confirm that there is at least some “cross-genre” element to interstitial writing. When Sherman describes her own writing, “interstitial” crosses over from mere example to the personal:  “What I ended up writing can best be described as a kind of historical fantastical-Romantic-social realism. That's not what I set out to do, of course. What I set out to do was write something that unpacked the dark places of my heart, that satisfied my need to make beautiful patterns out of words and emotions and images, that allowed me to play with characters I loved, and to explore some of my ideas about class, courage, morality, revenge, purity, pain, and the role of the individual in society. It was more comfortable for me, and a lot more fun, to place these explorations long ago and far away, in times and places where clothing, manners, and language were more decorated and more formal than they are now, when the surface of life was beautiful and expansive even when that which it covered was nasty, brutish, and short. I didn't abandon magic or magical beings or fairytale themes, but I began to use them differently, and I turned to 19th Century novels and Renaissance Drama for my structural models. In writing what I wanted to write, I found myself moving away from the beautiful Fields of Fantasy out into the wilderness that abuts the bustling cities and well-tended plains of Historical Fiction.”  I like this part of the introduction the best because, for me, it articulates dual paths of passion and obsession, which is where much of the best writing comes from. Seeing this passion on the page in connection with the interstitial is another reason why I have come to think of “interstitial” as a supple, useful term—it is flexible enough to serve one well on the level of theory, but also on the level of the relating to the artist or writer, in the actual creation of art.  Fenkl’s essay on the Interstitial provides added detail at the theoretical level. It is at times a down-to-earth approach:  “It took me a long time to figure this out, but in publishing, a thing can be one thing or the other, or one thing and the other. For those with an established name recognition (Stephen King, for example), this logic applies simultaneously, but if you are a small fish, you may be both things, too, but only as long as it's one thing at a time. This is not an absolute rule, of course. But it is a general rule we have little choice but to ‘publish or perish’ by… In the world of publishing this way of thinking presents itself as a series of either/or decisions: Fact or Fiction, Fantasy or Science Fiction, Genre or Mainstream, Mystery or History? I present these categorical problems as dilemmas of a sort, but in many cases the possibilities are not initially limited only to two; and yet, when a particular work is hard to classify, its final label is then often compared to or contrasted with a series of other possibilities, one at a time.”  Therefore, an interstitial approach to literature discards limiting, often meaningless terms such as “fantasy” or “mainstream” in favor of a more holistic approach. It removes the engrained opposition between genre and non-genre to consider the work from a multitude of perspectives. I particularly like the idea of an interstitial approach representing and, not either/or. Certainly, this is more indicative of the mindset of the writer while creating fiction—a time at which most thoughts of category or market are nonexistent.  Fenkl then discusses the difference between an interstice and an intersection:  “An interstice is not an intersection. (That is why a concept like hybridity, by itself, is not adequate to the idea of the Interstitial.) The word ‘interstice’ comes from the Latin roots inter (between) and sistere (to stand). Literally, it means to ‘stand between’ or ‘stand in the middle.’ It generally refers to a space between things: a chink in a fence, a gap in the clouds, a DMZ between nations at war, the potentially infinite space between two musical notes, a form of writing that defies genre classification.”  Clearly, then, interstitial literature is not simply cross-genre, not simply a hybrid. “Cross-genre,” for the purposes of the interstitial, is a term now probably used to describe both cross-genre and truly interstitial writing. For this reason, interstitial seems like a more natural term than “cross-genre”—a chemical rather than physical reaction. Could it be said that in an interstitial work, the disparate elements combine in such a way that they cannot return to the same state they enjoyed before they were mixed together? (At least, in the reader’s mind?) As opposed to some “cross-genre” approaches, in which a physical reaction takes place, the elements mixed together (the equivalent, perhaps, of hay, rocks, and a pair of earrings) fully able to return to their prior state? This may be stretching both terms a bit, but I find the idea of the interstitial describing disparate elements combined in a chemical reaction somewhat compelling. (Or, perhaps, this simply describes good interstitial writing as opposed to bad interstitial writing. I admit I’m on shaky ground here…)  Do works thought of as interstitial always remain interstitial? Not according to Fenkl:  “Things are complicated in the DMZ of the Interstitial. There is another problem, an unexpected one. Interstitial works are also self-negating. That is, if they become successful to the degree that they engender imitations or tributes to themselves, or, if they spark a movement which results in like-minded works, then they are no longer truly interstitial, having spawned their own genre, subgenre, or even form. The DMZ they initially inhabit becomes its own nation, so to speak.”  In the process of naming or identifying a thing, it eventually becomes part of the old, even if once new.  Thus, a rather joyful element of the interstitial—like a river that over the years changes its course, creating a new path and new banks, interstitial arts are forever being redefined. Non-static. No inertia. This approach also mimics the philosophy of the writer who does not wish to repeat him or herself. The interstitial, to a writer, turns out to be the farthest thing from a straitjacket—the writer in a sense sets the course through sheer individuality. Ten years from now, writers who strike out for fresher territory than what is currently considered “new” will find the interstitial still all around them, as relevant as ever. That is a movement I can live with.  In the “Illuminating the Interstitial” section of his essay, Fenkl writes:  “What the Interstitial does, actually, is transform the reader's consciousness. The reason that the formerly invisible historical trajectories become visible to the reader is because the interstitial work, in combination with the reader's particular perception of it, has manifested itself in such a way that the reader's ‘reality’ has changed. We have figures of speech for this kind of transformation at a profound level—‘I have seen the light,’ for example—but the transformation caused by the Interstitial is far more subtle. Perhaps instead of something as extreme as ‘The scales have fallen from my eyes,’ one might characterize this change as ‘A scale has fallen from my eye.’ In any case, the reader has learned to see in a different light, and that change causes a reinterpretation of the reader's experience of the past—in general—though perhaps this begins with a re-examination and reinterpretation of other texts the reader has experienced.”  I believe that in the creation of interstitial work, the writer as well as the reader has the experience of the scales falling from one’s eyes. It is in this way that the writer and the reader benefit from a sense of the world as it truly is—a chaotic, confused, complex place in which juxtapositions of beauty and horror, reality and fantasy (and more subtle variations), occur on a daily basis. (If we experience epiphany only rarely in our daily lives—epiphany as a sudden recognition of the strange and wonderful journey we all are on—perhaps it is because we do not allow ourselves to be open to it. Because the potential for it  is  all around us in our daily lives. This is one thing interstitial literature gives us--a pathway into that sudden recognition.)  To me, the term Interstitial and the reasoning behind the creation of the term both feel natural and relevant. I’m looking forward to further exploration—both what “interstitial” evolves into for me personally, and what it means in terms of a dialogue with other writers and creative people.

      ...or a disease guide. I was planning on running this piece as a blog entry, but BookSense has decided to use it on their site, so I'll just include a link to the piece instead, right  urlLink here .  There's a longer version of the article, too, much more detailed, but a magazine is considering it. If they don't take it, I'll post it here.

      I suppose I should feel guilt that it's already October 13th and I haven't posted in almost two weeks. But I don't. I've been having a lot of fun writing a few key scenes for the novel, as well as writing two new stories: "Shark God Versus Octopus God" and "Three Days in a Border Town." One's a fun take on a Fijian myth. The other is a brooding meditation in a far-future setting.  And I've been hiking. Every chance I get, I've been hiking, either at St. Mark's or at trails closer to home. Today, I did six miles of trails near a place called Forest Meadows. It was a brisk pace and a rather threatening landscape, since I walked at dusk and the trees were full of fungi and lichen. I enjoyed it.  I will post a real blog entry by next weekend.  Cheers,  Jeff

      So, I'm lost this past Sunday at St. Mark's Wildlife Refuge, doomed to hike about 12 miles instead of the 6 I was planning, much of it in the heat and biting flies that typify the end of the Florida summer, when suddenly I relax--my body and my mind relax, and I'm walking along but my mind is bobbing along on a string somewhere up above--and realize just how wrong my life has been the last few months; not wrong in most ways, in that my personal life and my day job life are going just fine, and I have been writing--instead, wrong in my assumptions and my vision of the future...because here I've been sprinting to finish my novel--a novel I've been working on since 1999--and the only reason I'm doing it is to make sure I don't miss some "window of opportunity" from a major US publisher, and in the meantime I'm making a good book exactly that, a good book and not a great book...and I want to at least attempt a great book. So while I was rambling out in the wilderness, much as this paragraph has been rambling without much respect for the signposts and markers of proper punctuation, I realized that the most important thing I can do right now is to slow down, to establish the right pace to finish this novel, and to do it right, in every possible way. And if for some reason everything evaporates into thin air before I finish, to hell with everyone and their mothers; at least I got the novel done right.  Of course, my practical wife points out that with so many projects coming out, it's unlikely interest will die quite as soon as I think it will.  Meanwhile, I will explore this novel like I explored that wilderness--without a road map, not caring much for the trail, and see where it takes me. If that means another year  out there , so be it.  Do not be surprised if I throttle you if you ask me if my novel is done, however.  Jeff

      Our cat Pretty Ugly got his name because Ann thought he was ugly and my stepdaughter Erin thought he was pretty. So I suggested "Pretty Ugly." Since Erin was so young, she didn't realize that we might as well have called him "Very Ugly."  Pretty Ugly weighed sixteen pounds. He had a rip in his right ear. He had two fangs missing (a third got torn out later, in a fight, after we took him in). Although mostly white, he had rather distinctive black splotches--on his head and ears, and on his back (near his butt, so we called that splotch his "butt spot"). His tail was black except for a tuft of white at the very end, almost like a dandelion tuft. It was only later that we realized how beautiful he really was.  We first became aware of Pretty Ugly because he hissed at us from the edge of our yard. He hissed like no cat I've ever heard. It was a kind of spitting, belligerent hiss, with his fur all standing on end. At the time, we were trying to rehabilitate and find a home for a cat called Plushy who was infinitely friendlier than that ugly white-and-black cat hissing at us from the edge of the yard. We figured Pretty Ugly wouldn't be around for long. At that time, our yard seemed to attract stray cats, all of which stayed around for a few days and then left.  But after a few days, Pretty Ugly was still there, hissing from the edge of the yard. All of the other cats had gone away, and Plushy had been placed with an owner. After awhile, it became kind of routine--we'd come home and there Pretty Ugly would be, hissing and spitting at us from the hedges. We began to grow attached to him. Ann started leaving food out for him.  Winter came, and it actually gets cold in north Florida during the winter, so we got a little worried about Pretty Ugly. He wouldn't come inside, so we put out a cardboard box lined with towels in the garage and made sure the garage door was open enough for him to get him. Soon, the hissing and spitting came from the garage. The few times when we'd go look in on him, there he'd be, gutting out the winter in his box, staring around the side of the box long enough to hiss and spit, spit and hiss. He liked to vary it.  Over time, and as spring came, Ann found that by bringing his food closer and closer to the house, she could get him close to the front door. Eventually, he ate on the mat outside the front door. Ann would sit there patiently day after day, feeding him. Then, one day, still hissing, he came inside when Ann dropped a couple of treats inside the front door. After a week or two of sitting inside the front door, he began to explore. Hesitant, suspicious, fearful. At first, he wouldn't sit in our laps, so one time I just picked him up and plopped him down in Ann's lap. He didn't stay long, but he got used to it, and soon he was sitting on our laps and…purring. (When we took him to the vet to have him fixed, we found out he already had been, and there was a sudden anger at the thought of someone having abandoned or so badly treated him that he took almost six months to even think of trusting us.)  It was then that he really became Pretty Ugly, a web of myth and folklore built up all around him.  First, there were the names. Pretty Ugly wasn't his only name. Oh no. Of the names that are not protected family intellectual property, I can reveal the following: Pugsley, Butt Spot, Chubs, and the Bowler-Hat-Wearing Cat Detective (Ann didn't like this last name very much). Sometimes we called him "Pritz," for short.  Second, there was his tail. We were very afraid of Pretty Ugly's tail. We soon realized it was a creature in and of itself. It might be slashing back and forth while Pretty was calm. It might be calm while Pretty was sinking his teeth into us. The Tail, we were convinced, had a mind of its own. One did not mess with Pretty's tail. Because the Tail and Pretty had an arrangement--and that arrangement was to bite the shit out of us if we messed with the Tail. Still, sometimes we did, and got what we deserved.  Third, there were the scars. Pretty loved to be petted. He loved to sit in our laps. But too much of a good thing and he'd suddenly go wild. He'd bite and claw us--sometimes enough to draw blood. He'd just go nuts every once in awhile, even though he was such a sweet cat most of the time. After the first year of this, we became so used to it that we would sit down to watch TV together, Pritz would jump on one of our laps, and when we got up after an hour, we'd have these bite or claw marks on our hands and not even realize how it had happened. Over time, those marks became a sign of our love for Pritz, and of his essential eccentricity. The last of Ann's scars from Pretty Ugly are healing now, and there will be no more scars caused by him. We will miss those scars as much as anything.  Fourth, there were his forays into the yard and beyond. For a long time, before he became ill, he was an indoor and outdoor cat. In the yard, he became a different kind of cat. It took him awhile to realize he didn't need to catch birds anymore to survive. It took him awhile to realize it was wrong to stalk the neighbor's Chihuahua. Pritz was always most hopeful about the outcome of this enterprise around Christmas, when the stupid Chihuahua wore a little sweater and a hat with a bell on it. Pritz would home in on the bell quite easily, and begin his gliding stalk of the poor little dog. (As I say, he was a big cat, and although for a time he was fat, most of his sixteen pounds were earned.)  He also loved to take dust baths in the front yard where the grass had been defeated. He loved nothing better than to roll around on his back in the dirt in the sunlight while Ann or I sat in a chair nearby and read.  And, sometimes, while outside, Pritz would quite literally go crazy. Possessed of the energy of not just his body but the Tail, he would scurry up and down trees in the front yard at a break-neck speed. It made us laugh until we cried, the way he'd zip up one tree and zip down it in search of another.  He could be a scared cat, too, though. The oddest things used to scare him. He loved playing with bits of rolled up newspaper or magazine. (In fact, nothing pleased him more than to sit on a Sunday newspaper and then slowly shred it to bits with claw and fang.) He loved to play with catnip mice (and loved catnip itself, although we're not sure if the Tail liked it). But he hated the kitty tease that our other cat Shoshana liked to play with. The kitty tease wasn't really different from the rolled up newspaper--it was a small fishing rod, basically, with a moth-like strip of cloth hanging off some fishing line. But it terrified him.  What terrified him sometimes changed. For example, he'd been fine with the telephone for the longest time, but one day happened to noticed the cord from the receiver to the phone itself. For the next few hours, he would hiss at it, attack it, jump back, and repeat the process. Maybe he thought it was a snake? Regardless, when we got a new phone, we got the cordless kind.  Another time--eerily enough soon after the Blair Witch movie came out--we'd come home and find him staring blankly into a corner for minutes on end! And whistling--Ann whistled once, only to find Pritz running up to her, meowing weirdly. From then on, if we wanted him to come to us, we had only to whistle and he'd climb up on our laps, making this odd meow--a very serious meow. It almost seemed as if he thought we were hurt and he was concerned about us.  Pritz also had a number of ailments during his life. During the first few years we had him, he got these odd warts on his lips. The vet told us he'd contracted feline acne, of all things, and we had to give him pills and change the kind of water dish he drank out of it. Our cat was a teenager!  Once, we were about to go on vacation when we found that he was sick. It was so sad--we found him sitting right underneath an outdoor water faucet sticking out of the side of the house. It was leaky, so he was sitting there with this look of irritation on his face while one slow drop after another fell right on top of his head. We immediately took him to the vet.  Then, later, he began to yowl in the middle of the night and eat a lot more than usual (and he was a pig to begin with--often eating Shosh's food as well as his own) and run around the house. Eventually, the vet discovered he had a thyroid problem and he had to have one of his thyroids removed. For awhile, he had a patch of naked skin near his throat that I know irritated the heck out of him, no matter how we helped him scratch it.  Pretty Ugly survived all of this, only to be diagnosed with a cancerous tumor early this year. He began to lose weight and become more and more listless. He stopped going outside. He stopped eating regularly. We had to put him on pills and feed him Gator Aid through a syringe to get his electrolytes up. It was really only a matter of time, but for awhile we thought he might be okay--the medicine got his white blood cell count back up. But the tumor grew and the cancer spread. Right before the end, he was little more than six pounds, down from thirteen, and it really hurt to see him like that, all tiny and wobbly, tottering around and looking up at us for help. Still, he liked to sit on our laps, and he still purred, and his Tail still seemed like something separate from him. Some days were better than others.  The worst thing about all the book-related trips we've had to take this fall and winter was having to leave Pritz behind with a cat sitter. We were in New York City when the call came in last Thursday that Pretty Ugly had passed away in his sleep. It was almost unbearable.  We'd had Pritz since 1996. We never knew exactly how old he was--somewhere between 12 and 15. He'd been the best, most eccentric cat we'd ever had.  Pretty Ugly had spent many a morning curled up in my lap while I wrote Ambergris stories. And, in turn, I wrote about him, for hundreds of thousands of third graders, when I had to turn in an English passage for my day job (Web-based sample tests as prep for the state standardized test).   Pritz loved Ann's shoes. He loved to just sit on them. One day, we came home and found that he had actually put Ann's shoes on. He'd managed to sit on them with one paw in each shoe. It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. He liked to drink out of the toilet. He'd stand up on his hind legs and spread his front legs out like he was hugging the bowl and drink in the middle of the night. We'd turn on the light, and there he'd be, looking slightly apologetic. Sometimes, he also liked to sit in the bathtub, which is one of the reasons we thought he might be part Turkish Van, since they love water. In the mornings, when he wanted to be fed, he would bite Ann on the forehead, or walk on her head, or claw the bookmark out of her book. Some nights, he would plop down on my right side and I'd curl over on my side and I'd cuddle with him while he purred loudly. He had a really really loud purr; you knew when he was happy.  We would never have been prepared for his death, even if he'd lived to be thirty or forty. Even now, we turn at the dinner table to feed him a scrap, or go through our routine of "Pretty Ugly get me the remote control" before stopping short and realizing he's not there. We didn't anthropomorphize--we just loved him for his quirky eccentricities, for the way he made us accept him on his terms, scars and all.  So this blog entry is for Pretty Ugly, an extraordinary cat. We'll never have another like him.

      While we've been traveling, I've been picking up books here and there. World Fantasy in DC, in particular, yielded some great finds. But I've also found some interesting books recently at Tallahassee used bookstores. Herein, a list, with annotations. For most of these, I've had no chance to do more  than just skim some chapters, read some stories, in these books, but they're all on my to read pile because, well, they all look wonderful so far! So, in no particular order (just as you might find them in one of those great but frustrating New Orleans bookstores, where everything is stacked, jumbled, confused, but glorious):   Limekiller by Avram Davidson  ( urlLink Old Earth Books ) - I've just read the first two stories, but have to confirm Jonathan Strahan's enthusiastic review in Locus--these are Davidson's best stories. The introduction by Lucius Shepard is brilliant, too. The cover leaves a lot to be desired, though; in fact, I recommend you strip off the dust jacket and set it aside somewhere while reading.   Another Green World by Henry Wessells  (Temporary Culture, temporaryculture@yahoo.com) - Wessells is an antiquarian book seller from NYC who has been instrumental in helping publish much of Davidson's work posthumously. Now he's come out with a book that, quite frankly, if the  urlLink Ministry of Whimsy  hadn't been overstocked, we would have taken. These wonderfully bookish, Borgesian stories come highly recommended by Guy Davenport, William Gibson, and Michael Swanwick. If all goes well, we may offer some of these on the Ministry web site.   Floater by Lucius Shepard  ( urlLink PS Publishing ) - A cop who has just shot a Haitian immigrant in NYC experiences a floater in his eye--a stray bit of protein that occludes part of his eyesight. He begins to have visions. The shooting incident takes on new dimensions. The cop begins a downward spiral. I'm about three-fourths done with this one. Shepard is a brilliant writer, and Floater is great noir with a possible supernatural element to it.   The Angel in the Darkness by Kage Baker  ( urlLink Golden Gryphon Press ) - I'm a huge fan of Baker's Company stories and novels. However, this Company novella is of poor quality comparatively. It's more or less a slice of a larger piece, and it's dogged by too many scenes in which characters must explain plot to other characters just so the reader will understand what's going on.   Monterra's Deliciosa & Other Tales by Anna Tambour  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Tambour is a fresh and interesting voice. Although this collection is too long--the poetry and a couple of what appear to be nonfiction pieces could have been cut, along with a couple of the weaker fictions--it provides a nice overview of a writer to watch. I particularly enjoyed stories like "Klokwerk's Heart," "Temptation of the Seven Scientists," and "Dr. Babiram's Potentials". Tambour's offbeat stories and quietly confident prose are a delight to read. Several of these stories posit truly original situations, characters, or narratives.   Weirdmonger by D.F. Lewis  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Long overdue, Des Lewis' first comprehensive collection of idiosyncratic short fiction showcases the best of his work from 1987 to 1999.  No one writes quite like Lewis--and I can recall with some clarity how Des would include, with his submissions, a list of quotes from reviewers that ranged from raves to pans. Des has never worried much about other people's opinions, and as a result, his fiction remains unique, challenging, and, in some essential sense, timeless.   The Monsters of St. Helena by Brooks Hansen  (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux) - Hansen, who wrote the masterpiece The Chess Garden and the solid novel Pearlman's Ordeal, has finally written a dud, with this tale of Napoleon's sojourn on the island of St. Helena. From the pull-way-back introduction in which the reader gets a long-view historical brief on the island to the interesting characters to the interesting prose, Hansen has managed to waste it all on an inconsequential and utterly boring story. I've rarely seen so many potentially wonderful elements amassed for deployment...only to be deployed in such a banal and disappointing manner.   Bibliomancy by Elizabeth Hand  ( urlLink PS Publishing ) - Although her novels are good, Hand's real strength has always been at the shorter lengths, and Bibliomancy has me drooling in anticipation. The packaging is gorgeous as well, with Fitzgerald's "The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of" as the cover art. Lucius Shepard, who seems ubiquitous at this point, contributes an engaging introduction.   The Tyrant by Michael Cisco  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Cisco is inexplicably "cult" to my mind, mostly because he's had one critically-acclaimed book (The Divinity Student, Buzzcity Press) followed by five years of silence...which didn't mean he wasn't busy, just that he had some difficulties with potential publishers holding on to his manuscripts for too long. Anyway, now The Tyrant is out, in another beautiful package, with cover art by Harry Morris, and it's a good novel. It starts very, very slowly--needlessly so--but once you get past the first thirty pages, there are several marvels here for the adventurous.   The Dark edited by Ellen Datlow  (Tor) - This looks to be a potential classic anthology of ghost stories, with work by Jeffrey Ford, Kelly Link, and several other great writers. I'm really looking forward to reading this one.   Wonder Tales: Six French Stories of Enchantment edited by Marina Warner  (Farrar, Straus, Giroux) - A fetching small-sized hardcover of French fairytales retranslated from the French by such writers as A.S. Byatt and John Ashbery. A beautiful package, and clever, playful writing.   Tales from the Crypto-System by Geoffrey Maloney  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Another great collection from Prime Books. Probably the best way to describe Maloney's work is to reference my own blurb on the back cover: "At his best, Geoffrey Maloney uses the surreal in the same way as J.G. Ballard, but with his own twists.  A Maloney story is not to be trusted--it will turn on you when you least expect it, and your brain will be irrevocably altered."   He Do The Time Police In Different Voices by David Langford  ( urlLink Cosmos Books ) - I just love David Langford's work, whether for Ansible or elsewhere. This fascinating-looking collection of parodies and pastiches (of Ellison, Herbert, Lewis Carroll, etc.) is next on my list to read.   Japanese Gothic Tales by Izumi Kyoka  (University of Hawaii Press) - Gabriel Mesa turned me on to this collection of weird Japanese stories.   Faking Literature by K.K. Ruthven  (Cambridge Press) - We picked this up in the Shakespeare library in Washington D.C. It's a collection of essays about literary fakes and frauds. So far, it is tough going but still interesting. I may not finish it--I may just skim and, er, steal from it...   Sewer, Gas, & Electric by Matt Ruff  (Aspect SF) - I've finally remembered to buy a copy of this supposed cult classic. I'm sure hoping it turns out to be good. I thought Fool on the Hill was crap (his talking animals irritated me), but thought I'd give Ruff a second chance.   Winter in Majorca by George Sand, trans. & annotated by Robert Graves  (Cassell) - Wow. We picked this up in a used bookstore two hours before we had to leave DC. I have to quote you the dustjacket copy to do the book justice: "In 1838, George Sand arrived in Majorca with Chopin and her two children, Maurice and Solange, offspring of her marriage to Baron Dudevant. Majorca, at that time, had not fallen under the influence of the Romantics, and George Sand, arriving with Chopin, smoking cigarettes, and both she and her daughter wearing masculine clothes, caused more than a little stir. It would appear that the Majorcans made little attempt to understand her, and she little to understand them, and contact between the two was rare. After three years, the little party left the island and returned to France. Within two years, Un Hiver a Majorca was published, a book which though praising the natural beauties of Majorca, condemned the Majorcans as barbarians, thieves, monkeys, and Polynesian savages who cheat, extort, lie, abuse, and plunder, and went so far as to suggest that the majority of the inhabitants were the bastard descendants of Carthusian monks. It was a book as full of vitriol as it was of inaccuracies...but it is described by the Encyclopedia Britannica as one of the great travel books of literature, and Majorcans continue to print and sell it to visitors--without comment on its errors and slanders." This edition contains Jose Quadrado's "Refutation of George Sand" as well. Holy crap. I am so looking forward to this one...   Lady Churchill's Rosebud Wristlet no. 13, edited by Gavin Grant and Kelly Link  ( urlLink Small Beer Press ) - LCRW has undergone a welcome make-over with this issue, changing to perfect binding and a full-color cover. It looks classy and sophisticated without sacrificing any of its home-grown appeal. Ghosting page numbers across the middle of pages is not a great idea, but a good experiment. Some of the cutesy added stuff on the inside has by now worn thin--it begins to seem fey and smug rather than funny (think flat McSweeney's)--but there are good stories in the issue, and the magazine continues to publish new writers of interest.   Bittersweet Creek and Other Stories by Christopher Rowe  ( urlLink Small Beer Press)  - Another in the impressive series of chapbooks from Small Beer: artfully designed and chockful of good writing. I'm looking forward to this one--I very much liked Rowe's story in Trampoline.   Other Cities by Benjamin Rosenbaum  ( urlLink Small Beer Press)  - And, yes, yet another in the impressive series of chapbooks from Small Beer: artfully designed and chockful of good writing. I've read a couple of these tales, which have been compared to Calvino in Invisible Cities. To Rosenbaum's credit, they don't read like pastiche--these are actually very different from Calvino's stories, with more emotional punch, and I think Rosenbaum is definitely a writer to watch.   El Vilvoy de las Islas by Avram Davidson  (Henry Wessells, POB 43072, Upper Montclair, NJ 07043, $12) - A handsome little chapbook version of Davidson's eccentric tale. You know, I really feel for Davidson. The guy was using literary techniques, and absorbing influences, that should have made him a respected member of the literary mainstream--or at least a respected member of the fantasy community. And, sure, he was, to an extent, embraced by the fantasy community, but he deserved a heck of a lot better. So here's another little gem by Davidson. While you're reading it, just remember that there's another Davidson out there somewhere, right now, who's going to suffer the same damn fate while he or she is alive.   Argosy edited by Lou Anders and James A. Owen  ( urlLink Coppervale)  - When I first saw this magazine at WFC, I said to Lou, "This is fucking amazing. Wow. What a fucking great looking magazine." So far, I've only had a chance to read Jeff Ford's excellent "A Night in the Tropics", but I'm still marveling over the great look of the publication. Two soft trade papers in a slipcase, one an exclusive novella by Michael Moorcock. Truly cool.   The Case of the Persevering Maltese: Collected Essays by Harry Matthews  ( urlLink Dalkey Archive Press ) - The only American Oulipo member has a lot to say about, well, Oulipo, and a lot of other topics. I haven't read it yet, but I'm very much looking forward to it.   The Song of the Dodo by David Quammen  (Simon & Schuster) - Island biogeography in an age of extinctions. Interweaves personal observation, scientific theory, and history. Looks very interesting.   Landscape and Memory by Simon Schama  (Vintage) - A discussion of the relationship between man and nature, setting and character, in a sense. Another one I'm looking forward to...   The True History of the Kelly Gang by Peter Carey  (Knopf) - I've always had an uneasy relationship with Carey's work, but I keep trying him despite what seems a chronic unevenness in his work.   Congo Journey by Redmond O'Hanlon  (Hamish Hamilton) - I picked up this nice UK hardcover of O'Hanlon's classic in a DC bookstore. I'd lost my US hardcover, titled No Mercy, and so was very happy to find this version. Basically, O'Hanlon travels into the Congo to see the elusive pygmy elephant. While there, civil war breaks out, all of his bribes and agreements with the central government go out the window, he gets sick, and everything just goes to hell. He barely makes it out alive. One of the great, truly surreal (and funny) travel narratives of all time.   In Evil Hour by Gabriel Garcia Marquez  (Avon) - I'd never heard of this short novel by Marquez, and so was delighted to pick up a paperback of it.   3000 MPH In Every Direction At Once: Stories and Essays by Nick Mamatas  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Boy, the sophomoric attempt at introduction-as-parody-of-introduction by Zoe Trope that opens this book is bad, bad, bad. What follows is...well, 3000 mph in every direction. There's no guiding principle at work here, nothing to tie it all together, except Mamatas' unique voice. Thankfully, he's got a strong voice and a strong writing style. Although I enjoyed the essays more than the fiction, it's a collection worth picking up.   A Right to Be Hostile: A Boondocks Treasury by Aaron McGruder  (Three Rivers Press) - Hilarious political, cultural, and societal commentary in cartoon form, with an African American slant. I only experienced five installments of this cartoon in the local paper before they pulled it, so this treasury was a god-send. More pointed and confrontational than Doonesbury without sacrificing a certain subtleness.   School for the Blind by Dennis McFarland  (Ivy Books) - I don't know why I picked this up, but it looks interesting. A man toward the end of his life returns to his home town only to find the past catching up with him. Not a thriller--it looks like a book Peter S. Beagle might have written if Beagle wasn't interested in the fantastical. Anyway, I'm hopeful...   The Russian Debutante's Handbook  by Gary Shteyngart (Riverhead Books) - Lots of hype, could be trashy, but it looks like it's alive and kicking and vivacious even if it winds up sucking.

      For many years, Allen Ruch has been building, renovating, and adding to one of the great centers for literature on the Internet:  urlLink The Modern Word .  The greatness of the site was brought home to me while talking to Allen at the World Fantasy Convention. The projects in process--a long essay on Kafka, possible short fiction reviews, expansion of the book reviews section, etc.--and an off-the-cuff comment Allen made about how, for example, Borges fans think the Borges section of the site is the entire site (when in fact there's a huge Joyce section, a huge Marquez section, etc.) really made me re-appreciate a site I might have begun to take for granted. The site really is that large, and that comprehensive.  There's also a joyful mingling of writing about great literature, regardless of where that literature comes from, the literary mainstream or "genre."  So, if you haven't visited the site, you really should give yourself the pleasure as soon as possible.  Jeff

      World Fantasy Con 2003, in Washington D.C., for me, was about three things: spending time with my wonderful wife  urlLink Ann , sightseeing; hanging out with an idiosyncratic, fun, always interesting group of people; and pimping the  urlLink fake disease guide  until I thought my own tongue was going to grow disgusted with me and escape my mouth, so as not to have to say "The New Yorker asked for review copies of the Guide" or "The Guide is being featured on the new hardcover fiction table in every Borders in the United States." The utter repetitive boredom of having to do the used car salesman routine for the first half of the con, while also organizing or helping organize the readings and other events, made me a mere shell of a VanderMeer.  From  urlLink Borders reading  (photo by huge stack of books; book featured in front window; Jay Lake in black goggles; my close friend and co-editor  urlLink Mark Roberts'  excellent bio introductions; Stepan Chapman's "in character" reading as a doctor, complete with stethescope) to con suite party reading (Alan M. Clark, Robert Wexler, Jay Lake), to autography party (pleasant sensation of wrist aching from volume of books to sign) to late night convention reading (where, too exhausted by it all to stay, I slipped in to take photos and then slipped out again, my tongue telling me, "I will leave you one day, Jeff, if you don't take a break. I will go away while you are not looking."), there were long blurs of time caused by the disease guide where my attention span was fragmented, shattered, recombined in sound bite-sized time slots.  Luckily, as the convention slouched closer and closer to the awards banquet, it became less about the disease guide and more about meeting interesting people. And throughout this time, Ann and I would slip away to do more sightseeing. A few things about D.C. struck us. One, there's an awful lot of construction work being done that tends to ruin the view. Two, it's a very walkable city. Three, it was definitely bittersweet visiting the capital of the U.S. with a fascist idiot in the White House, a point driven home at the National Archives, where the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, and Louisiana Purchase were juxtaposed with a nattering nabob of a piece of legislature by George W. Bush. That Bush did not belong to the same lineage that had helped compose the great documents of our country could not have been better underlined if the Bush document had been written with a crayon.  Politics aside, we enjoyed ourselves. The Spy Museum, which I thought looked cheesy, but went to with Ann because she wanted to (and, frankly, she's always right, so now I've done away with the grumpy attitude because it always ends with me saying, "You know what--that was fun."), was…well, tons of fun. From an air duct you could crawl down to spy on other visitors (although I preferred to think of it as the air duct from Alien, just to make it more exciting), to the full array of spy toys, an exhibit on the history of spies in film and television, the Spy Museum was worth every penny. (Of special note, the copies of Prisoner novelizations written by Thomas Disch!)  The Lincoln memorial, with its etched excerpts from Lincoln's most famous speeches, was oddly more moving to me than the Vietnam memorial, whereas it was the exact opposite for Ann. Somehow, the black wall of names, although in their multitudes, rendered all of the dead anonymous to me, whereas the Lincoln memorial, with that oddly serene, almost giraffe-like rendering of Lincoln, flanked by his words, struck a chord.  The Smithsonian natural history museum and the Library of Congress were both somewhat disappointing--the British natural history museum and library in London are vastly superior--but the Smithsonian's bug museum, with its cross-sections of honeypot ants, and the gem sections were spectacular. The Library of Congress just did not have the kinds of exhibits we expected. We expected to see opened books under glass--famous and popular texts. Instead, we got an exhibit on Lewis & Clarke and the Wright brothers.  After these various perambulations, and in between them, we would return to the convention and immerse ourselves in the parties, and meeting people. Our own posse or group often consisted of (the truly fun and wonderful) Jason & Molly and Jeremy from Night Shade, Forrest Aguirre, Allen Ruch from the Modern Word (who posted truly inspired photos and captions  urlLink here ), Dan Read, Gabriel Mesa, Eric Schaller, Mark Roberts, K. J. Bishop, Michael Cisco, Robert Devereux (on the last day), Rudi Dornemann (one day), Allen's friend Christopher (who was kind enough to guide us around DC one night), Stepan & Kia Chapman, Sean Wallace, and Robert Wexler, with others slipping in and out. (I've probably forgotten someone, alas. Please do not wish me ill because of it.)  I wish I had freakish stories to relate to you, dear reader, but I do not. It was fun. It was hilarious at times. Mark Roberts' undulations with a certain hat were a highlight one night. As was a mutual admiration shouting match at an Irish pub over the subject of Nick Cave, with the effervescent Jeremy. (Now that I recall, I think we spent much of most of our evenings in an Irish pub…) Also great--talking politics and novel writing with the wonderful Paul Witcover, getting a chance to talk briefly to Kelly Link, Lou Anders, Jeff Ford, Jason Lundberg, Chris Roberson, John Picacio, Jim Minz, Christopher Rowe, Greg from Dreamhaven, Peter Cannon, Michael Walsh, Paul Barnett, Jonathan Strahan, Holly Black, Ms. Snyder (who loaned me more whiskey when my wife took my first cup and refused to relinquish it), Laura Anne Gilman, Ellen Datlow, Theodora Goss, Delia Sherman, (watch me name- check like a playah), Gavin Grant, (and still I will forget someone), Alan DeNiro and his wife Kristin Livdahl (we had a fun conversation about meerkats in fiction--she too has written of meerkats in a SF setting!).  My attempt to turn to hard liquor due to being on the Atkin's Diet led to almost-tragedy one night as I attempted to drink seven scotches (Dan Read had found a scotch that was too damn smooth!; positive repercussion: no nerves when doing my well-attended individual reading the next morning--in fact, no nerves, no feeling in my extremities, no particular idea of where I was or might have been...). Hanging out in the bar with the funny and knowledgeable Lucius Shepard, Deborah Layne, and several others to watch football for a couple of hours created a nice cocoon of relaxation in between events, as did a lunch Ann and I had with the lovely and funny Juliet Ulman. The annual agent dinner, with the always charming and graceful Howard Morhaim, all of us replete in tuxedos or fancy dresses (I won't tell who was in which), was great as usual, as penguin-like as I felt throughout.  The awards banquet and ceremony went off without a hitch. Even the sharp shooting pain that flashed through my chest when City of Saints lost in the short story collection was quickly healed by winning in the anthology category, and the fact that my good friend Jeff Ford had won in the short story collection category. Although the high point of the convention, for me, was accepting Zoran Zivkovic's award on his behalf in the novella category. (And then rushing back to our hotel room with Ann, Kirsten Bishop, Michael Cisco, and others to email Zoran to let him know immediately.)  After the awards ceremony, we sat in the bar and drank Gabriel Mesa's excellent whiskey (although we had to keep the bottle under our chairs so the Bar Nazis wouldn't see it and kick us out) while smoking some great Nicaraguan cigars I had brought. To relax in that moment, drinking whiskey and smoking cigars was to relax utterly and forever. (And what a kick having Leslie What, among others, join us and light up!) Later, after another Irish pub experience, a group of us walked down to the famous giant obelisk in the dark, enjoying both the night and each other's company.  What else shall I report? That I have good friends. That it was a joy to see friends of ours who had not met each other before hit it off so well. That it was wonderful to see disease guides fly off the Night Shade table as if they were manna from heaven. That it was the simplest and most profound pleasure to just be walking around D.C. with my beautiful monosyllable Ann, with the trees beginning to change color, with the mallards bobbing serenely in the many ponds, with the scent of winter in the air.

      I'm somewhat behind on everything--thus a blog about something that happened about a month ago...  I was at mile 13 of a fourteen-mile trail at St. Marks Wildlife Refuge when a big cat walked onto the trail about 70 feet ahead of me and started coming toward me slowly. It was somewhere between 50 and 65 pounds--a big, panther-like animal. Gray back, rust-red chest, longish tail. It was one of those moments where you feel both utterly helpless and completely exhilarated. I mean, I had a small buck knife and a walking stick, and it's sauntering toward me like it doesn't even care I'm there. I'm downwind, so it can't smell me. I have few options. If I retreat, I'm going to have re-trace my steps to the tune of possibly 13 miles to get back to my car. That's really not an option. So I'm standing there with my knife and my walking stick, just mesmerized by this big cat coming toward me. It's not stalking me. It's not running. It's walking, and looking over at me with this look that's indescribable. I'm thinking, am I really going to have to try to fend this thing off? Everything was so still, and I couldn't move. Both because I couldn't think of what to do, and because it was so surreal. The animal got to within 20 feet, still watching me, and then jumps off the trail into the underbrush. All I can think of is Rilke's panther for some reason.  I talked to a friend who knows a ranger when I got back, and it was either a juvenile Florida panther or a very large jaguarundi, a type of South American cat introduced to Florida in the 1940s. In either case, a very rare sighting for Florida, particularly North Florida, and one that left me rather breathless. It seemed like a very magic realism moment.

      At first, I thought about resolving in 2004 to not write any nonfiction, including blog entries, postings on message boards, etc. It was a very attractive resolution in theory. I need to focus on my fiction and jettison anything not connected to the fiction. But could I actually do it? Probably not. So my new resolution is to stay away from blogs, messageboards, etc., as much as possible for the first quarter of 2004. As a result, there will probably be little activity here on a weekly basis--maybe every month or six weeks. I might even abandon this blog altogether. I'm not sure yet.  I've completed two stories in the last month and am at last gearing back up on SHRIEK: AN AFTERWORD. Here's hoping I finish the damn thing soon.  Oh yes--and a 2003 year's best list at  urlLink Fantastic Metropolis .  JeffV

      So, after the triumverate of Washington D.C., New York City, and Minneapolis in Nov-Dec of last year, it's on to the triad of Orlando, Columbia (South Carolina), and England (Blackpool, London, Coventry, etc.) in Feb-April of this year. Not quite the time crunch of three major cities in less than four weeks, but pretty close, when you throw in a couple of readings in Tallahassee itself in March. Besides, it looks now like I've got about seven events planned for England.  We just got back from the Orlando gig yesterday--which consisted of being part of the Visiting Writer series at Trinity Prep School. Trinity Prep is a private school with grades six through twelve. The senior English classes had been reading "The Transformation of Martin Lake" and "The Strange Case of X" from City of Saints & Madmen. Before reading "Strange Case of X," they'd been reading Malcolm X, so it looked pretty surreal on the syllabus--and was probably pretty surreal reading-wise, too!  I spoke to six English classes Monday, which consisted of me giving the students some background on the publication history of City of Saints (four failed publication attempts before the final book came out, including a publisher who stole all the pre-order money for his honeymoon [although I was told later, his emails actually came from an insane asylum where he'd had a nervous breakdown] and another one who said they loved the stories but wanted me to change the setting to Paris around 1900) and then me answering student questions.  This was my first captive audience. I remember my own high school English class as being somewhat jaded. Half of the class tended to be indifferent to whatever text we were studying. When we had a guest speaker, about half the class could have cared less. Of course, short of juggling and doing some kind of song and dance, I didn't have much recourse re entertaining that half of the class in this case.  The questions ranged from clear put-up jobs to questions poised by students with a genuine interest in what the answer might be. Each class had a different energy--and I had a different level of energy in response. In one class, we actually did a writing exercise. And in the last class of the day, after picking on the class smart-ass (who, admirably, and to my horror, did a good job of holding his own), I found myself drawing Cheshire cats on the blackboard, among other things. By then, I was exhausted from the repetition of introducing the book and answering some of the same questions. Drawing Cheshire cats seemed like a very good idea. And I'm sure the class itself was just ready to go home.   In general, I tried to be as honest as possible in my answers, even when that honesty meant the answer was less interesting in a way. There are all kinds of ways in which writers can falsely glamorize their profession, their approach to writing, their skill set, etc. As soon as I set foot in the classroom, I was dead-set against anything that might be considered even a slight fabrication, because, for the most part, the students all seemed very sincere.  Questions included one about the significance of the rose in "The Strange Case of X," a rose that mostly solved a technical issue for me--How to identify the characters when the shift to third person to first person hits?--and an aesthetic one involving the darkness of colors in the story. My initial reaction that the rose had no other true significance raised some eyebrows, since its symbolism appeared to have been a test question for the students. (In fact, my answer apparently spread like wildfire through the senior class, since a later class had this question: "Is it true that the rose doesn't mean anything?") In later classes, I clarified a little, in pointing out that most of the images I use are charged images--they have a built-in symbolism to them, although it is not something that comes to me consciously. It's just there. And I spoke a little bit about how the reader meets the writer half-way, and how a reader's interpretation can be valid regardless of the writer's main intent. I talked a lot about how I write by feel and intuition rather than a conscious process, even in my most self-conscious pieces.  One student asked, "In Martin Lake, why can't they just kill Bender themselves?" I replied that that was a very good question and that the story--and City of Saints in general--might answer that question satisfactorily for some readers and not for others. And that most stories have at least one fault point--a point where it's possible to say the story might not exist except for luck or chance.  Another student asked, "Is Martin Lake guilty of killing Bender? Should he have done it?" I told this student that I wouldn't have done it--that I truly couldn't have, and that Bender's captors probably would have killed me. The student wanted to know, still, if Lake was guilty. I said there were extenuating circumstances, and that really the question isn't fully answerable--but that it was one of the central questions of the story. Was Lake culpable? Could he live with himself in the absence of certainty that he had any other choice.  Yet another student asked why I wrote so much about mentally disturbed people. I replied that my interest was in the nature of obsession and of love. People who are deeply obsessed or deeply in love are very close to being insane.  I was also asked, twice, about whether or not I used hallucinogenic mushrooms--to which I replied, no, because even a glass of wine is enough to disrupt my ability to write. I also shared--because it's sadly funny, not as a warning--the story of a writer friend of mine who had begun to use drugs more and more heavily, his stories becoming shorter and shorter until most of them were only a paragraph long.  But if I was exhausted by the end of the day (I now have even more respect for teachers), I was also very flattered and humbled by the attention some of the students had given to the text. Some had even bought the extended edition and asked me to sign it. Many of the questions had made me think of my work in a different way, and I had learned that it would not do to be sarcastic or too joking, because many of them were sincerely hanging on every word. One student, named Angela, had so loved City of Saints that she had gone out and bought Veniss Underground and had several of my books to sign. I was really rather touched and, again, flattered, by that reaction. I remember how obsessed I had become with certain authors while in high school. It both energized me and humbled me to have been able to create that obsession in someone else.  In fact, I had many flashbacks to high school while at Trinity, while at the same time I was trying hard to concentrate on the students AND to catalog details about the school--there's a scene set in a private school in Ambergris in Shriek: An Afterword, the new novel, and I wanted to make sure I took some telling detail home with me.  Then it was time for the multimedia presentation, with about 90 to 100 students present. They laughed in the right places, which reassured me, and the auditorium was so beautifully put together, I felt quite at my ease. I am so comfortable with the material I read for the multimedia presentation that I've begun to sculpt the individual City of Saints excerpts with a different tone and rhythm for each. Soon, I'll be able to do the transition text without referring to my notes.  After the presentation, during which I read the Bookman Old Style erotic font note from City of Saints, I was asked what sexual acts capital H, M, and O represented in the font. To which I replied, "That is for consenting adults in the privacy of their own homes to discover." Which was not, I suspect, a satisfactory answer.  I also had students come up asking for writing advice, which was quite sobering. They were all very earnest and serious--as they should be--and it struck me that I should take great care in whatever I should say to them--that it would make a much greater difference to them than to most people I talk to creative writing about. One asked for advice on who to send his poems to. Another, an eighth grader, I think, told me she was writing an article on me for the school paper and that she was working on a novel and wanted advice on what to do with it. I asked her how far along she was. She said she was in the middle of it, that it seemed like it was never going to end. I could tell that any answer I gave her about her novel was going to mean a great deal to her. So I told her that what she should do is concentrate on finishing her novel. That in any novel there comes a point when it feels like it will never be finished, that the only thing for it is to keep slogging along, that if one part wasn't going well, to skip to a part that was more fun to write and go back and write the other bits later. (This was uncomfortably close-to-home for me, in that all I could think of was Shriek: An Afterword, sitting in folders at home, not yet finished.) It was, again, rather humbling, and rather wonderful to have that interaction. I learned a lot and I had a lot of fun.  Two other things happened after the presentation--Ann brought out the alien baby, which was greeting with cries of "The alien baby! The alien baby!" from several students who, unbeknownst to me, must have visited my vanderworld web site. That was sincerely funny. The other was the raffling of two smoked turkeys to help fund the school's literary society. In honor of Ambergris, the cook had stuffed them with mushrooms rather than traditional stuffing!!  It was also fun to have dinner with Robbie Boerth, who arranged for my trip down to Orlando as a visiting writer, and his wife, Stephanie, whose English students I had been interrogated by all day. In addition, Brendan Connell had, by a stroke of luck, flown into Orlando for a family reunion just before I arrived, and was able to join us on two occasions and for a Borders signing. Brendan is a disease guide contributor and proved to have a very good sense of humor in addition to an encyclopedic knowledge of interesting obscure writers. Rounding out the group was book dealer Mark Wingenfeld of Kathmandu Books--extremely knowledgeable about books in general, funny, and an all around great guy. Drinks with Robbie, Brendan, Mark, and my long-suffering wife after the presentation Monday night made for a relaxing, fun time. (Also fun--talking about the Patrick O'Brian novels with one of the creative writing teachers, dinner with an English teacher and a biology teacher and her very serious baby named "Bob", and meeting a Latvian painter.)  (My wife Ann had, of course, been her usual wonderful self, sitting through each class and asking her own questions if the pace flagged or it seemed relevant to explore some topic, manning the laptop for my multimedia presentation, and just generally taking better care of me than I deserve.)  I came away from the whole event with a renewed sense of purpose, a better understanding of my own writing in City of Saints, and just a general fondness for these kids, who were where I remembered being some 20 years ago--on the cusp of great opportunities, not always sure what they want to do in life, not always secure in who they were, sincere, funny, polite, sarcastic, clique-y, and yet individualistic. They were a really sweet bunch of people, and I wish them well.

      I'm still working on my novel and thus trying to avoid blogging and messageboards (although I'm not doing so well re messageboards). The novel's going well. I've got 90,000 words now, and it looks like it'll top out at 120,000.  In the meantime, if you've just stumbled upon this blog for the first time, check out the archives. I should be back by March with more stories of odd jobs, among other things.  I do have a couple of recommendations, however. First,  urlLink Matthew Cheney's blog , which consistently displays real thought and passion about fantastical fiction and many other topics besides that. Cheney's blog is the best I've read recently. There're a lot of entries I wish I'd written.  Second, Gabe Chouinard's  urlLink Singularity blog  is worth checking out. There's a lot of heat lightning there, but also a lot of interesting discussion. At the very least it gets beyond the kind of polite banalities that serve as a kind of death elsewhere.  And, for those of you who subscribe to the VanderWorld Report, please note that I will put one out before the third week of February, although it may be shorter than usual.  Cheers,  JeffV

      I'm going to start posting little rough draft excerpts from Shriek inbetween "real" blog entries as I begin to reach the end of my work on the novel. Just to kind of reward myself for lurching ahead with it by releasing some of it into the world. The narrator of the novel is Janice Shriek, and throughout there are parenthetical asides by her brother Duncan.  Jeff   The war continued in Ambergris...  And yet, on certain days, in certain parts of the city, you could walk down a dozen streets and not even realize a war was going on—if you could rationalize the mortar fire as thunder. Markets were open, people walked to work, the telephones operated (even if few wanted to use them!), restaurants served what food they had. The Religious Quarter, for political reasons, remained largely safe, with both H&S and F&L doing a respectable trade in foodstuffs and clothing—sometimes while fighting raged only a few blocks away. A few times, I was still able to meet with artists and gallery owners, and I regained a little respect from them because of my new profession. People tended to find it amusing, but not in a mocking way. 	In part, this sometimes sense of safety was caused by a retrenchment by both sides after the first seven or eight months of the war. After House Lewden’s original probes and feints toward H&S headquarters, and toward taking control of the docks, and after several intense battles, F&L had been held to the northern third of Ambergris. They controlled part of the docks, a portion of Albumuth Boulevard, but they could not smash through to H&S headquarters. After the initial shock, H&S had recovered enough morale and discipline to hold their ground. Thus, the “front” became relatively stable, except for sneak attacks and mortar fire, and spies, of course. The regularity of it became a kind of comfort. (I was never comforted. The whole conflict had troubled me from the very beginning. Just trying to guess the reasons for gray cap involvement bothered me. Never before had they backed one faction over another, or even seemed to recognize the difference between factions—or seemed to care. Why now should they change tactics? Besides, their weapons were everywhere, but they were nowhere to be seen.) 	Still, it could not go on forever. The city was in real danger of becoming less than a city, of becoming rubble and black smoke and piles of bodies—of becoming twenty different cities that only loosely formed a country called “Ambergris.” 	Duncan sensed this, but could not anticipate (articulate) it. 	“We’re near the end,” he said one evening eighteen months into the war, as we sat in the smoldering remains of the Café of the Ruby-Throated Calf. It was more or less neutral ground now that most of it had been destroyed by mortars. At least, we could count on no one trying to kill us as we sat there, protected by overturned tables and a few strategically-placed shrubs. The service was terrible, but, then, the waiters were all dead.  	Duncan was pale but whole, face dark with dirt, a flurry of cuts rubbed red. We were drinking a couple of bottles of Smashing Ted’s Finest Ale, which we had found in an abandoned store, miraculously unbroken under a fallen, splintered door.  	“Near the end?” I prompted. 	“Yes,” he said, and took a long pull on his beer. “We’re near the end. Something has to give. Someone has to blink. To change. It can’t go on this way. It just can’t.” 	“It’s done a fine job of going on this way for awhile now, Duncan,” I reminded him. I took a sip. It was warm, almost hot, but the bite of it still tasted good. 	“Maybe I mean I can’t go on this way,” he said. 	“You mean, being paid in eggs, cauliflower, and milk?” I said. 	He laughed, but I knew he was thinking about Mary, always Mary. She had come free of her Academy obligations a couple of months before, finished her extra coursework, and graduated with honors. Bonmot had no hold over her anymore, except for the hold created by her gratitude. She and Duncan had moved into an apartment off of Albumuth Boulevard, in an area under Hoegbotton’s control. A nice little domestic arrangement. I think they were happy at that time. Certainly, nothing in Duncan’s journal from the time denies it. A typical entry read:  I wake up to the sunshine and to her. I’m not sure which I’m more enamored of. This freedom after much heartache seems almost unreal. She’s here, in front of me, sleeping. I can watch her as long as I like—catalogue the elements of her beauty, from her rose-colored mouth to the fine down above her upper lip to the soft line of her nose to the long dark lashes that frame her closed eyes to the neck with its delicate glide to the lightly freckled shoulder and the golden-hued arm that has slid out from beneath the sheets during the night. I should wake her. I should. But I can’t. She’s so peaceful right now, and the world outside is not. I gain strength from watching her like this, and I hope I give it back to her as well when she is awake. I must cut this short—the mortars are going off again, and she is beginning to stir.  (That’s a nice entry, Janice, if atypical for more than a short while. I almost feel as if I am trying to convince myself with that entry...I went home to her every night after hours of hard, dangerous work. Under even the best of circumstances, I would hardly have made what you would call a stable lover. But with bombs exploding everywhere, screaming shells digging into the street only blocks away, and the random violence of the militias, I was very unstable. There were times when the danger brought us close together, when we didn’t need words or other constraints, like it was with her back at Blythe. And then it was good. But the rest of the time, I loved her despite the tense, closet-like atmosphere. I admit it—there was no way to preserve the allure of the forbidden, of having to sneak into her room at night. Now I was the man who snored at night and sometimes, choking on the spores in my throat, woke gagging. I think I began to scare her almost from the beginning. This was everything she hadn’t seen yet. She wasn’t ready for me. She was brave in many ways, but not that way. I can’t blame her. My reality must have seemed very strange.) 	We sat there in the café and watched as across the street six Hoegbotton irregulars took up positions behind a stand of trees and began firing into the buildings, from which came spiraling down the distinctive crimson bullets that had become known as “Lewden Specials.” Two of Hoegbotton’s men went down writhing and clutching their chests. An F&L supporter fell from the third story of one of the buildings and landed with a wet thud on the pavement below in a confusing welter of blood and bone. 	And we just sat there, watching and drinking our ale. Really, it was tame next to what we had already seen. Really, it was expected. We had to concentrate on the important things; anything else, we had no time for. So we sat there for another half hour and talked while men killed each other across the street.

      The novel continues apace. I hope to have almost a complete, good draft done before I leave for England April 7th. That would mean less than 2-3 months separate me from completion of a draft good enough to send to my agent.  Watch this space for the following: - A short feature on Myrtle Vondamitz III, Scott Eagle, and other artists I love. - An entry on the painful publication history of City of Saints & Madmen - More Odd Jobs  And, just for kicks, I'll post a couple of paragraphs from the novel that I just completed at lunch today.  Jeff  	It had been a strange, strange war—two years of watching Ambergris, like some sun-drenched, meat-gorged reptile, make one of its random attempts to molt, to shed its skin, to become something new. All across the city, from the narrow alleys of the ruined Bureaucratic Quarter to the wide bustle of Albumuth Boulevard, we could sense it coming. Odd alliances formed under stark orange skies. The vertical invasion of telephone poles, for example, once a random dotting, become a concerted march from the docks into the city's scaly white underbelly. Guns poured in with the telephones, both originating from the Kalif's empire (although often by way of F&L's agents, already gathering in the city, fly-thick and just as black-swarming). The guns came in every size and description, most of them oddly bulky and gleaming with the kaleidoscopic reflection of unknown new metals. They smelled both new and old at the same time, and they smelled of far-off places, as if the metal had soaked up the essence of the foundries and factories that had produced them. The guns frightened me. They seemed like an emanation from some future Ambergris, some place that did not yet exist, but soon would. 	The outdoor café life became charged with danger and interruptions. Shootings and stabbings became all too frequent. (The novelty of guns was too much temptation for the average Ambergrisian, I think. They were too new for us to assimilate.) Motored vehicles began to reemerge in the city—dark, dank metallic beetles long dormant—as new Hoegbotton resources brought barrels of sticky black fuel into the city. 	The very air smelled different—it had a charged quality, as if we were all breathing tiny particles of gunpowder; our lungs burned even without the impetus of pollen in the spring, and in the fall, even on days where the air wasn’t cold and dry. (This was not your imagination—the spore content of the city began to change, to be transformed. The gray caps had begun their slow but inexorable translation/transformation.) 	At the time, I don’t believe any of us thought much about these changes. Ambergris, for all of its history, its secrets, its allure, had always been dirty, sickly, on the verge of crumbling back into itself—battered, babbling, incoherent in its design and intent. Inevitably, we all thought, the molt wouldn’t take, and the reptile that was the city would sink back into the mud a little, its skin ever more mottled from the experience.

      The  urlLink South Carolina Book Festival  (Feb. 27-29) is, alas, now a blur. There have been too many events in too short a period of time for me. Instead, a few shiny shards of reflected light continue to cycle through my brain--a brain now frantic to return to the novel and also start planning for the England trip planned for April 7 - April 19. Still, I think I'll take a stab at a report on the festival. What the hell...  I do recall the pleasant shuttle ride to the hotel in Columbia, South Carolina--Ann and I shared it with  urlLink Stella Suberman  (The Jew Store),  urlLink Sara Lewis  (multiple mainstream literary novels, laced with humor and featuring female protagonists), and  urlLink Ibrahim Fawal  (both a novel and a history of the piss-poor situation in the Middle East from the Palestinian point of view). Ibrahim liked to entertain, and interspersed stories about the great energy and intellect of John Barth and John Gardner with the tale of his one moment of true and certain fame: a small role in Arnold Schwarzenegger's first movie (in which he played a college professor and for which he continued to get $20 residuals to this day).  Once at the festival, we hurried down to the literary meet-the-authors gala, where Jeff and Lynn Ford and Michael and Jeri Bishop were already waiting--along with the truly spectacular  urlLink Felice Picano , who we had previously met in Minneapolis. An open bar at a writers' gala is about as wise as a buffet at an Overeater's Anonymous meeting, and soon everyone was pleasantly or unpleasantly buzzed. One of the great ironies of the Atkins diet for me is how it has driven me from mixed drinks to hard liquor. Still, the scotch was excellent, although it drove me to larger and larger tips, the bartender's grin growing wider as the evening progressed.  Afterwards, we went out with Vicki and Kevin Parsons and a friend of theirs, Tripp Reade, who is working on a novel. Vicki Parsons is the organizer of the festival, and Kevin had been helping her out. A long time ago, in a distant galaxy, Kevin and I had worked together at the software company that still employs me to this day. It was a lot of fun seeing them again, and spending time downstairs in a bar with live music--covers from the 1960s, 70s, and 80s that all sounded exactly the same: like grunge--blaring above us as we ate one of the only things they had left on the menu--spiced meatballs. By this time, I was extremely drunk, but very happy. With any luck, all Ann, Vicki, Kevin, and Tripp picked up on was the "happy" part.  We got back after 1am and went our separate ways, me to a half-delirious sleep in which I had one of my recurring dreams: that I'm driving a supermodel to the corner grocery store in a pickup truck to get some milk and eggs. Then I drive her back and she gets out. End of dream. A relatively useless dream, really.  But unable to sleep for more than five hours, I got up at 6:30 and in a state of wretched guilt and some discomfort sought out the gym, where I proceeded to lift weight and ride a stationary bike for a good hour. There, I thought, that will help. And maybe it did--since I managed to last through the day, although at one point Ann, and possibly Mike Bishop, became alarmed when my face and neck turned bright red half-way through the afternoon.  We got to the festival before 10am so we could see Felice on his panel, The Art of Memoir. It was a memorable panel--in part because I managed to stay conscious during it despite the fact that a Hangover was clearly beginning to have its way with me. I was at this point not in any particular pain, more of a fog, with a kind of itchiness permeating my body, a kind of twitchy scotch-induced distance. I began to feel somewhat guilty--after all, I was supposed to moderate a panel from 2:30 to 3:30--A Fantastic Voyage: Science Fiction and Fantasy Writing, fellow panelists being Jeffrey Ford, Karen Joy Fowler, and Michael Bishop.   By this time Ann had already discharged her duties, doing a very nice interview with John Saul on one of the main stages. Several times Saul's head had whipped around to stare at Ann due to the very precise and researched nature of her questions. Perhaps somewhat disturbing, however, was a revelation from the crowd: one couple claimed to read nothing but John Saul, and when they finished reading his entire oeuvre, they would go back and re-read it until his next book came out. I don't think any writer could live up to such constant, monotonous, pile-driver-type reading, and yet this couple seemed perfectly happy. I was happy for them. What a state of bliss to live in. What a state of certainty and stasis. I was almost certain their house must be the center of some nexus of Time Interrupted, some place that Proust would eventually have gotten around to investigating, had he lived long enough.  Also during the afternoon came the revelation that one of the famous authors had a stalker. This stalker, in a chiffon dress, had actually bumped into me the other day and kind of backed up weirdly and done a half curtsey, while mumbling about "pardon me sir." I hadn't thought of her as being insane, but it had seemed odd. In any event, this was someone who, while on her meds, was perfectly nice, but not on meds would accuse the Famous Author of stealing her words. The Famous Author therefore had this bizarre relationship with the stalker, whereby he would get off stage after doing his shtick and she'd be waiting there, and he'd say calmly, "Hi. How're you? I guess I'll be seeing you on that cruise I'm doing next week." Apparently, her rich husband gave her the freedom to follow the object of her fixation everywhere he went. It was an odd situation, half funny and half rather disturbing. The Famous Author had a half-sympathetic shadow. Ann or someone teased me about the possible transference of the stalker to moi. I pointed out that authors who make less than $30k a year rarely are able to generate any passion in the heart of a stalker...  Then came the fantasy panel, which went very well--except for the point at which the panel revolted. This point came when I relayed a quote M. John Harrison had made about how the best fantasies don't come with maps, after which Jeff Ford more or less leapt in with "Bullshit!", as did Michael, and, perhaps less adamantly, Karen.  This amused me no end, although my hangover-influenced face may not have conveyed much more than shock, since I had given Mike, Jeff, and Karen the questions ahead of time and asked them to let me know if there were any they didn't want to answer or which were stupid. But, in the end, it opened up the panel and made it much more organic, and that was a good thing. Still, I thought it was pretty funny. So much for prepping ahead of time!  We had great attendance for the panel--I think on Saturday over 4,000 people visited the festival and we had a large room with most of the seats taken; possibly the crowd was between 100 and 200, very hard to say, especially since I was still being managed by my hangover. The questions from the audience were great, although we finally had to disburse when one gentleman said, "Given that we're all going to be cyborgs soon, how will that affect how you do characterization?"  Afterwards, we went and signed, with respectable lines for all of us. I'd read the erotic font note as part of our introductions and City of Saints sold out in the dealer's room as soon as the panel was over. I felt somewhat guilty. After all, the rest of the book was nothing like the font note. Still, I didn't feel that guilty.  Then, after perusing the dealer's room a bit more, it was time to return to the hotel and have some down time before the author shindig for dinner: delicious barbecue in a building that had once been a synagogue. Throughout the entire event, I have to say that Vicki Parsons and her staff took good care of us. The event was well-organized, well-run, well-attended, and just a success in every way.  The barbecue building being a little too loud to hear ourselves talk, Karen, Jeff, Lynn, Ann, and I retired to the hotel lounge to talk about bad movies and late fees and some of the Oscar nominees. A discussion of New Weird and the Interstitial was mercifully short.  The next day, I was feeling much, much better--just in time for the flight home. We'd had a great time, had a chance to meet some very different kinds of writers and also pick up their books, while taking advantage of Vicki and Kevin's splendid hospitality.  Later, I asked Kevin what some of the highlights were for him, and this was his reply:   "My personal highlights for the weekend include:  "Jeff Ford's description of grabbing and throwing his son's Snickers bar away to avoid a potential bear attack.   "Aaron Gwyn's, a short story writer, answer to the audience question: 'Who is your favorite short story writer and where is your career headed?' His response: 'Flannery O'Connor and down.'  "Karen Joy Fowler's publishing advice to Tripp Reade: She pointed out that the Science Fiction magazines and journals not only publish a lot of stories but they pay pretty well. Tripp replied that his stories weren't really science fiction. Karen replied: 'Well, Tripp, you told me that you had one story with a talking weasel in it. That would make it a science fiction story. So all you have to do is put a talking weasel in all your other stories and start sending them out as science fiction.' "  And on that note, even my artificially extended memory of the festival again becomes murky, although I cannot think of one non-pleasant moment that was due to anything other than my inability to properly metabolize scotch...

      A True Tale of Innocence from Before 9-11  Sometimes an event occurs that seems as if it could only have happened to someone else. The surreal aspect of the event softens the impact during the experience, but only adds to the bewilderment afterwards. For me, that event occurred in December 1998, about 13 weeks into my stint at an editing job for a Tallahassee, Florida, computer consulting company…  It begins with the arrival at my workplace, one cold day, of two detectives. They are both over six feet tall and wear dark suits, guns strapped demurely to their belts. The receptionist calls me up to the front of the building. The detectives introduce themselves and ask if they can speak to me in private. I have yet to realize that the surreal event has begun to occur.  I guide them into a conference room, we sit down, and they immediately begin to ask what I think of as very odd questions.   “Mr. VanderMeer, have you ever been to California?”  “Mr. VanderMeer, have you ever sent any packages to California?”  Have I ever sent packages to California? It may be statistically anomalous and yet still true that almost every writer who lives in the United States has at one time or another sent some kind of package to California.  I tell them, yes, I have mailed packages to California.  By this time I am beginning to sweat and to stutter a little, because by my nature I tend to feel guilty even if I am accused of something I didn’t do, or even if accused of something harmless I did do, like sending packages to California.  At this point the detectives turn up the heat.  “Have you ever sent a package to XYZ,” one of them asks, naming my former place of employment.  I think back to my lovely time at XYZ. Working at XYZ had been like having a bit part in a theatrical production of Lord of the Flies recast to include business managers. While there I had ducked flying projectiles and hastily thrown verbal assaults. An employee once stole the football pool money and fled to Kansas City. Another employee had tried to rob a bank using nunchucks, and, failing, went to jail, but was not immediately fired. Once, someone had been so angry at someone else that, while using the urinal, they had punched a big hole in the cardboard walls of the men’s bathroom. The hole was never fixed, but remained there, month after month, as a reminder (to the male employees, at least) of the bottled up rage that might someday consume the place. An ex-Admiral had been brought in as a manager to restore order and dignity to XYZ, but even by the time I had resigned, nothing much had come of it.  But have I ever sent a package to XYZ? I concentrate all of my rapidly evaporating memory on the question. Finally, I say no, I don’t recall sending anything to XYZ. I want nothing more than to forget I had ever encountered XYZ.  That’s when they ask me if I am in the habit of sending bombs to my former employers.  Suddenly, I remember, a coldness rising in my stomach. Suddenly, I know, with obscene clarity, what they are talking about. They are talking about the damned pellet. I had picked up a number of novelty “message pellets”—basically, a metal capsule with a curled up piece of paper inside—at a store in Atlanta. Friends said it looked like the kind of thing a carrier pigeon might use. I had sent one to my ex-Admiral ex-boss on a lark several weeks before. Why had it just arrived now? I would never know.  So I ask the two detectives, “Is it a little metal pellet you’re talking about?”  One of them looks at the other, as if they’ve just broken the case, which, in a way, they have. “Yes,” they say, and suddenly everything comes into focus. They tell me that my ex-boss, the ex-Admiral, used to be in a Middle East bomb unit. When he got my friendly little pellet package, he called the bomb squad. Since I had scrawled my shorter post office box address on the outside, rather than my street address, and neglected to write my name, he had no idea who had sent the package to him.  Presumably adorned in bomb-resistant gear, a bomb squad unit had quietly stormed XYZ’s premises, reverently placed the package in a secure metal box, and then carried it out to the bomb unit vehicles, before whisking it away to the county sheriff’s department. Three bomb squad units had then spent the whole afternoon tracking me down.  Whereupon the detectives, tipped off by my post office box address, swooped down on my office and found me...and started asking me questions about California. (Someone had been sending letter bombs to addresses in California.) The detectives do not tell me all of this at once, so for several minutes I think that the ex-Admiral did know who it had come from, and that was why he had called the bomb squad. By this time, I am suffering from an onslaught of anger, coupled by profuse sweating, all of which I know makes me look guilty as hell.  The best news is that they haven’t opened the message pellet. It’s still at the sheriff’s office, waiting to be “defused.” Trying not to panic, I desperately attempt to convey the impression that I’m innocent of any wrong-doing, but some reptilian part of my brain equates the presence of the two detectives with guilt. Somehow, some way, I must be guilty of something, or they wouldn’t be sitting here talking to me. After some rather incoherent explanations, I think I am able to convince them I’m innocent. But I’ve still got to follow the detectives down to the sheriff’s department to give a statement.  First, though, I have to explain to my supervisor what’s going on. I step into his office while the detectives politely wait by the front door, and I deliver a speech that ends something like this: “So they think I bombed my former employer, and I’ve got to go down there to answer some questions.” My boss, who just conducted my three-month review two days earlier, gives me a look as if he’s unsure he made the right decision when he hired me. (I had already, unbeknownst to him, lied during the job interview. When I said I was a writer, he looked up from his notepad and said with a grin, “I hope you’re not one of those writers whose books have black-and-white covers and at the end someone’s head winds up on a shelf.” No, I said, I was not that kind of writer, even though he had just perfectly summarized my latest novel.)  “Well, try not to be too long,” my supervisor says, before returning to his work.  As I walk out into the lobby with the detectives, a crowd of co-workers gathers, all curious, to whom I only have time to say, "it’s just a misunderstanding—not even that, much more comical than that..." while the owner of the company leans against the door of his office trying to figure out why the cops are taking away one of his employees. As I pass the receptionist, she says something cheery, like, “This is so cool.”  Twenty minutes of driving across town through the beginning of rush hour traffic and the real fun begins: we reach the sheriff’s department. They take me up to the third floor and sit me down just outside of the room with the table, the little chairs, and the big two-way glass mirror. The implication seems to be, give us any trouble and you’ll soon be in there…  The detective asks me more questions.  "How many capsules have you sent out, sir?" "About 20. Maybe 25."  "Which is it? 20 or 25?" "23?"  In the background, another detective, identifiable by his grizzled chops, mutters audibly, "Christ! 23 pellets! We’re gonna have 23 bomb threats on our hands.                         "In Tallahassee?" "No. Not in Tallahassee. All over the country. In fact, a writer I correspond with just showed a pellet of mine to a couple of editors in New York. Which is kind of funny, since they had kind of the opposite reaction to what you…"  Here I trail off because no one else seems to think it is funny ha ha or even funny ironic...  "Where did you get the capsules?" "In Atlanta, Georgia. In a novelty store."  "What kind of novelty store? Do they sell firearms?" "No. It’s a coffee shop. It sells some neat novelty items—they advertised these pellets as message capsules."  The grizzled detective says, loudly, "I thought for sure it was a carrier pigeon capsule."  "Do you know the name of the store?" "No. But I think my girlfriend might remember it."  "Can you call her?" "Yes. She’s home sick, but I can call her."  "Call her." "Okay. I’ll call her."  I call my girlfriend (now my long-suffering wife...)  "Ann, hi. Do you remember the name of that store where I bought the pellets? Some people here need to know."  Ann: "No, I don’t remember. But I know it’s here somewhere—can you get it when you come home?"  Me: "Um, well, it’s kind of important to get it now."  Ann: "It can’t wait?"  Me: "No, actually.  Because I’m standing here in the sheriff’s office and they would like to know where I got the pellet because someone thought it was a bomb and so they’ve brought me in to make a statement about the pellet, so I kind of need to know soon where I got the pellets! "  Ann: "Oh. You’re in the sheriff’s office? What are you doing in the sheriff’s office? A bomb? Are you kidding?"  Me: "No. No joke. They think the pellet is a bomb."  The first detective gives me a look like, No, we never thought it was a bomb—why are you telling her that?  But she can’t find the name, so I agree to call them later with that information.  At this point, another detective comes over. This joker is slowly putting on surgical gloves as he approaches, with a great thwacking of latex. He’s got an enormous oiled mustache like Salvador Dali and he has more wrinkles than the actor Lance Hendrickson. I’m just a little bit worried that this guy thinks I’ve hidden more capsules in and around my person and wants to take a look...but no: he’s getting ready to defuse my pellet and he wants some reassurance from me.  Him: "Listen, son, is there anything you need to tell me about that capsule before I open it."  Me: "No. It’s just a message capsule. It has a piece of paper inside of it. With a message written on it."  Him: "What’s in the capsule?"  Me: "A message to my former boss. Saying hello, kind of."  Him: "You’re sure it’s not a bomb, son. I’m about to go in there and open it up. I don’t want any surprises."  Me: "No, really. It’s just a message capsule. It’s not a bomb…Of course..." (this was a stupid thing to say in this context—“Of course…” followed by a thoughtful pause—and I’ve made a mental note of that for future reference)  Him: "Of course what?"  Me: "Well, you haven’t let me see the package, so I couldn’t tell you for sure that it’s what I sent to my former boss."  Him: "It has your address on it."  Me: "Okay, then I guess it’s what I sent to my former boss. "  He leaves, along with three other detectives. I’m wondering what the hell he thinks the surgical gloves are going to protect him from if it is a bomb. Later, I realize they wanted to preserve fingerprints. Luckily, I keep my mouth shut. Out of my field of vision, the detectives enter the room that contains the pellet. There is, literally, an amazing silence. Even the detectives who are not in the room kind of hold their breath.  Then, about a minute later, I hear what sounds like a faint roar of laughter, possibly hysteria-based, which then abruptly cuts off. A minute after that, the first detective is back, holding my pellet with the message. He reads the message aloud for the benefit of the second detective: "Hello, [my former boss]—I hope the holidays are treating you well. Isn’t this a neat capsule? Keep in touch."  The suspense drains right out of the room and into the chilly afternoon outside the huge windows. It’s funny that the suspense drained then, but I guess they were still thinking something was not quite right, that I was some disgruntled employee, and they expected the message to read: "Hello, Dick—I hope your pets are all dead. Kick yourself in the ass for me. Isn’t this a neat capsule? Stay the hell out of my life."  So after that I talk to the first detective for awhile about how all the cop shows are laughable in terms of accuracy. The first detective says he’s getting out of the homicide unit because it’s making him lose most of his hair. I don’t point out that he’s completely bald. Another detective admires the workmanship of the pellet, saying, "This has gotta be mass produced. Machine-driven. Nice piece of work." A third detective pokes his head in and says, "Hey, so I guess there was no anthrax inside, right?"  By now, I’m completely exhausted. It’s not so much that it has been a horrifying experience—I’m still too shocked to be horrified—but it has been a surprising experience, and the adrenaline rush has wiped me out. So I’m escorted down to the outer rooms and sent on my way, the detective’s business card in my pocket so I can call him with the name of where I bought the @#$%!! pellets. (Later, when I get home, I sit in a chair and laugh for about half an hour, but it’s not a pleasant laughter.)  Shaky and looking at the world through rather more cynical eyes than before, I go back to the office, even though it’s after work hours, if for no other reason than to do damage control. I figure a lot of damage control will be needed if I’m to salvage my current job.  But I soon realize everything is going to be okay. I walk into my office to find that my co-workers have fashioned tin foil handcuffs for every single piece in my decorative collection of ceramic, metal, and wooden frogs. Further, a business card from a mental health recovery institute is taped to my computer monitor. Oddly, for the first time all afternoon everything feels normal.  On my computer, I find email from a couple of XYZ employees who had apparently just heard that VanderMeer might have tried to bomb his old company...And at that point, I just start laughing, quite as hysterically as the detectives had a half hour earlier... Meanwhile, somewhere out there in the dark, a somewhat paranoid ex-Admiral is being debriefed by a detective who hates cop shows. And the last of my pellets is winging its way by FedEx, by US mail, by land and by sea, to the last of my friends who might appreciate it.  ***  Luckily, my boss and the owner at my new job both got a big laugh out of the story and my reputation at work seemed oddly enhanced by my encounter with the law. Meanwhile, my former boss emailed me more than once apologizing profusely for the incident, no doubt afraid of a lawsuit. A friend of mine told me the bomb squad detectives had kept the capsule as a souvenir for what had turned out to be a hilarious episode for them—some of their last questions apparently being tongue-in-cheek.  And that was that. This was 1998, not late 2001. In a different context, at a different time, in another country even, I might have been led away to prison rather than let off with a nonchalant warning to refrain from pellet-sending.  That lesson I did learn. When I needed to communicate with my ex-boss one last time a year later, I used a regular letter in a regular envelope. I did not include a message pellet. I drew peace signs and flowers on the outside of the envelope. I wrote “NOTHING BAD” and “HARMONY” and “THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS” on it with a thick pen. The ex-admiral never responded, but neither did he call the bomb squad.

      Brain hurt. Brain hurt bad. I remember The Kingdom as a wonderful, creepy Danish TV pilot that had a pseudo-documentary feel. Now overlaid with images from Stephen King's remake, Kingdom Hospital--WHICH FEATURED A HUGE ANIMATRONIC ANTEATER WITH CARNIVORE-LIKE FANGS AND A FIRST HOUR THAT WAS A NAUSEATING ODE TO THE INTERJECTION OF KING'S OWN LIFE, IN THE FORM OF HIS VAN ACCIDENT, INTO A NARRATIVE THAT NEEDED NO ANTEATER, NOR NO VAN ACCIDENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Permanently scarred. Probably not. Flinching and eye-blinky for awhile. Yes.   A fucking anteater for chrissakes?!?! Forgive my French, but where I come from the only way you can stick an animal in a perfectly good non-animal plot and not ruin it is if you happen to have a spare squid handy...  Brain hurt bad. Trust me--this is the first and last post about movies on this blog, but...oy! The horror...  JeffV

      Ah, good old XX--Lord of the Flies with middle management (email me and I'll tell you the name of company). I worked there for over five years as a technical editor, putting city ordinances into book form. For a starting salary of less than $6 an hour (I'd been told I'd be making $6 an hour, then at the last minute was quoted a yearly salary I thought equated to $6 but turned out to be $5.75, so imagine my surprise when I got a raise to $6 some months later!), I would perform highly detailed editing work.  Sometimes I even got to field questions from citizens. We were only supposed to get calls from city clerks and city attorneys, but every once in awhile I'd get a call from somebody who lived in a city we did the code of ordinances for.  "Hello, Jeff here, how can I help you?"  "Hey, yeah, um, this is Mike. I need you to change an ordinance for me. There's a mistake in there."  "What city are you calling from?"  "Miami, Florida."  "Okay--so are you with the city attorney's office there?"  "Sure."  "What's wrong with the ordinances?"  "There's one in here about handguns."  "Which one?"  "The one about making handguns in your basement."  "Actually, it says you can't make handguns in your basement."  "Right--that's the problem. I need to be able to make handguns in my basement."  "..."  "The ordinance is all wrong. I need it changed. Can you change it so I can make handguns in my basement?"  "Are you really with the city attorney's office, sir?"  "Uh, no, but if you could just make this change..."  And so on and so forth.  We had some delightful ordinances to codify, too. For example, one town changed their legal definition of buttocks about 10 times in one year, either making illegal another quarter inch or making it legal again. One got the feeling a lot of people wore really tiny shorts in their town. Yet another passed an ordinance establishing an Official Meat Byproduct for the city. Still another proclaimed City-wide Frog Day. And, in an example of a specific nuisance creating a general ordinance, one small southern town passed an ordinance proclaiming that it was a misdemeanor to double-park your pickup truck on mainstreet at midnight while naked.  We had a pretty interesting set of managers, too. Because we had an indexing department and an owner who didn't read much fiction, we once spent quite a bit of time researching the viability of outsourcing our indexing services to fiction publishing companies. It was also rumored that the owner had decided to outsource typesetting and proofreading duties to a small Caribbean island once--he'd seen an advertisement for same in the classified section of the Wall Street Journal, with a phone number listed. According to legend, the owner had then called the number, set things up with the person on the other end, and sent some start-up money (anywhere from $5k to $100k depending on who you spoke to). When we finally sent a representative down to the island, he found out that the address was to an abandoned lot and the phone number was to a pay phone outside of a bar. Another time, a member of the inhouse print shop apparently took all the football pool money and took a bus to Kansas City to see his girlfriend. I do know that once another editor, in anger, punched a hole in the bathroom wall, near the urinals. The hole wasn't fixed for months.  The place had a pretty tense atmosphere--everybody was underpaid and the mix of people ran from the almost literally insane (I once passed an indexer's office only to hear, in two distinctly different voices, "You know you shouldn't do that."  "Yes, but you know you always do."  "Yes, but you know you shouldn't."  "But you always do.",  only to peek and find only one person in the office) to the merely eccentric. We also once had a guy walk into our team's office and say to this girl he was infatuated with "Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm a man of..." and continue on with the lyrics of a Rolling Stones song, but in such a way that we thought he was just talking--he then got so flustered that he stumbled by mistake into the women's bathroom, which was right outside of our door. After a pause of about five minutes, the door opened slowly and he scampered away. (Rumors of affairs between team members circulated left and right--at one point, it seemed everybody might be screwing everybody else, but who knew the truth of it?)  The clincher might have been the fact that we had a proprietary publishing system and one guy had the company by the balls in knowing its in's and out's. He was a huge barrel of a guy, bald and gone to fat, whose favorite pastimes were farting and calling women "bitches". Once, it was reported, the company was expecting some foreign dignitaries. They were going to have to meet with this employee. Management supposedly called him in to admonish him against farting in their presence!!  Other lovely stories--the employee who tried to rob a bank with numchucks and, once he was out of jail, apparently was offered his old job back. The first computer expert we had we apparently got because he was serving out a community service sentence for hacking, so we got him for free.  I didn't have a great relationship with some of my fellow employees, I have to admit. The atmosphere was toxic, I was sometimes harassed, and I sometimes got difficult because the place was like some kind of insane asylum. I once so heckled a fellow member of my team over a point of grammar that he came this close to throwing a rather heavy decorative frog tile at me. Another time, my proofreader took off with the pages to a job and ran into the print room, rather than admit to having made a mistake. Yet another time, I was told by the people who archived the hardcopy ordinances that we typeset from NOT to decorate the manila envelope with weird Cheshire Cat illustrations. So, right before I finally quit, I took great delight in using my little green frog stamp pad to stamp frog images over 99.9% of the surface of said envelopes. Was this wise or mature? Absolutely not. But, remember--I was a bit player in a workplace Lord of the Flies. At least I wasn't killing Piggy or eating raw meat.  Probably the worst part was being put on the "X team". This team was supposedly going to implement new ways of doing things, make the job more efficient, and evaluate problem employees. There are few better ways in an atmosphere like the one at that company to make other employees hate you, I think. Not to mention, all the other teams were named after characters or things from the Wizard of Oz, so we stood out like a sore thumb. That was the death knell for my career at that company. I could have stayed on forever, probably. I mean, I could have been an alcoholic with a morphine habit and I could have stayed on forever, but I was so unhappy I had to find another job (And finally did, at  urlLink Infinity --a place that is as good as this prior place was bad.)  There were certainly people I missed at the company. For every total idiot, there was also someone nice just trying to do their job under impossible conditions. But one thing I know for sure--if I'd stayed on, I would have eventually gone insane.  Jeff

      There's something about being deep in the guts of this thing that is both calming and frightening. There's still the sense of it never ending, of never finding an end to it. But there are also all these signs of progress, of the number of pages increasing, and of the right connections being made as the pages pile up. It's not yet clear to me whether I'll finish it before it's ready, if that makes sense, or finish it too late, or finish it just at the right time for the whole thing to ripen to fruition. But it's a lot closer than it was last week, and I've found a space in my mind to think about it that's separate from the wear-and-tear of every day life. That's promising, because I've felt so fragmented lately, between projects and tasks that have nothing to do with writing.  So I've decided to post more little flashes of it from time to time. Like opening up a vein and bleeding in public, probably, but what the heck. It's eventually going to get to readers anyway.  Jeff  [Janice writes:]  I was beginning to sound like a character in a book. I had to escape the relentless pressure of the words. I had to get away from the words. From the typewriter keys. From my wrinkled hands, which prove my brain lies to me about my age. From the faces staring through the green crack where the corridors synchronize into a fracture of seeing. From the feeling that I had just begun a rote recitation of the facts. (Janice, once you start a project like this, you just have to believe that people will be interested in all of it—not just the most exciting parts. You can’t leave anything out.)  I went for a hobbling walk, leaning heavily on my cane every step of the way. But when you’ve lived in a place this long, no walk can occur solely in the present. Every street, every building, appears to you encrusted with memories, with perspective that betray your age, your cynicism, your sentimentality, or your lack of feeling where you should feel something. There—the site of a quick fuck, a fumbling moment of ecstasy (“lover’s tryst,” Janice, is, I believe, the preferred term; once again your style slips from Duncanisms to gutterisms.) Here—a farewell to a departing friend. A fabled lunch with an important artist. The dust-smudged window of a rival gallery, still floundering along while you are forever out of business. A community square strung with paper lanterns where once you held an outdoor party. And if this were not enough—not relentless enough, not humbling enough—that unspeakable vision overlaying all of it, had I only the glasses to see, the vision I share with Duncan and perhaps no one else, that sees the mark of the gray caps on the city in a thousand signs and symbols. (This is why I prefer the underground parts of the city—they are actually more of a comfort these days.)  It is not an easy thing for me to walk through Ambergris these days, but also this comfort: why, she said, her heart breaking a little (melodramatically), there are so many friends to visit, ,even if they are under ground.  But at first I just hobbled down Albumuth Boulevard in the late afternoon light, letting my path be decided by the gaps between supplicants and pilgrims. I took deep breaths, to catch all the smells in this most beautiful and cruel of all cities: passionflower and incense, lemon trees and horse flop, rotting ham hock and coffee grounds. For a few minutes I tried to pretend to be a tourist, a passerby, an incidental part of the city. It didn’t work. How could it? I am Janice Shriek. No one knows that better than me.  I thought I might feel better if I headed for the site of my greatest triumphs, although my leg with its phantom attachment was already beginning to ache. I hadn’t visited it in ages. After a good half hour, I finally stood there, in front of what had once been the Gallery of Hidden Fascinations. A flower shop and a bakery stood to either side, but the part of the building that had houses the gallery, as if cursed, lay empty. The shadow where the handpainted sign had once hung had been branded into the wall by years of hard weather. Beyond the cracked windows lay dust, moldly frames, and darkness. No paintings. No paint not peeling. Just seasons and seasons of neglect. The smell of stale bread, rotting wood. Layers of purple fungus had taken root in the closest wall. Passersby hardly spared the place a second glance. It should have been a monument, or at least a memorial. It had housed dozens of famous paintings and painters. Conversations about all aspects of the arts had taken place there. Much of the art mentioned in the Hoegbotton tourist guides, the descriptions of the New Art movement—it had mostly started with my gallery. I had started there. Everything I was since had come from the gallery. This dump. This husk of broken timbers. Even my memories of it—saturated in the marinade of all five senses and as sharp as yesterday—could not bring it to sudden life. I might as well have never left the typewriter. I was still trapped in an afterword.  I headed into the Religious Quarter, immediately calmed by the sound of bells—bells from steeples and cathedrals, from alcoves and altars, which I could never quite find the source of, which lingered at the edge of hearing.  I disturbed a boy in the act of lighting a candle in the recess that marked the northern-most corner of the Church of the Seven-Edged Star. He looked up at me, his face whiter even than his white robes against the tousle of black hair, his eyes a glistening green, his mouth forming a half-conscious “O,” the long match held with divine grace in his slightly upturned right hand. The white of his revealed wrist sent a shudder through me, but he smiled and the image of grace returned.  He was right to light the candle, for the Quarter at that hour had not only distant bells but distant light, the dusk so strong it might as well have been a smell, a musk, that slid over the unprotected surfaces of cobblestones, windows, and walls, leaving behind the musky chaos of rippling illuminations that remain in the Quarter after dark. Priests shuffled past, murmuring with mouths and bare feet. Truffidians, Manziists, Menites, Cultists? Doubtless Duncan would have known. (I never was much of an expert on anything other than history. The ways of current religions hold little interest to me.)  Moving on, I walked to the edge of the Religious Quarter, by now an act of will; my feet really hurt—just past the stern-looking Truffidian Cathedral, and by way of a flurry of alleys, soon found myself in front of the Blythe Academy. The dark covered the academy comfortably, content to linger at the outskirts of lamps and torches.  Even from the street I could see directly into the courtyard, and beyond the courtyard into the student apartments, here and there a window illumined with golden light. In the foreground, the pale willow trees rustled in the breeze. (As pale willow trees are wont to do.) The stone benches and tables were solid, dark, strangely-comforting masses. A monk strode across the courtyard. Another followed, cowl hiding his face. The sweet, pungent scent of honeysuckle wound itself around me.  I do not know how long I stood there, remembering those long-ago conversations, but as I did, an unbearable sadness came over me. Nothing I can type on these pages can convey—truly—what I felt as I stood there looking into the darkened courtyard where Duncan, Bonmot, and I had sat and talked. And, if I am truthful, that place I stood in front of, which meant so much to me, no longer had any more to do with me than the Borges Bookstore. The moment, the spirit, had passed out of it and it was just a place once more. Duncan no longer taught there. Bonmot no longer sat behind the desk in his office, listening to the imagined miseries of yet another homesick student. Duncan had disappeared. Bonmot had died more than fifteen years ago.  What strange creatures we are. We live, we love, we died with such random joy and grief, excitement and boredom, each brain as individual as a fingerprint, and just as enigmatic. We make up stories to understand ourselves and tell ourselves that they are true, when in fact they only represent an individual impression of one individual fingerpint, no matter how universal we attempt to make them.  I stood there, mourning the death of that place even though it had not really died, even though it had since spawned a thousand stories to join the millions of stories that comprised the city, and then I walked back here, to the typewriter, to continue my epic, my afterword, so consumed by what? By emotion. That my hands are shaking. They are shaking right now. What shall stop them?  Perhaps a dose of the dead past.

      England was good, England was great. The novel awaits. Gone down the rabbit hole. Pulling the circle of black down over me. Haven't heard from me? Blame Shriek. Didn't send you something I was supposed to? Blame Shriek. Pissed at me about anything? Get in line behind Brian Keene. It'll be a long wait. When I come out again, there'll be dirt in my hair and leaves stuck to my clothes. The beard will need a trellis. The fingernails will qualify as their own countries. The eyes will be fixed somewhere quite other than here.  Ciao.  Jeff  P.S. But do me a favor while I'm gone--tell everybody about your Secret Life.

      It's no Invitation to a Beheading, but I'm sitting at an internet kiosk in the Cincinnati airport wondering why the hell I didn't think to book a reading or signing during the six hours we're here before heading on to England.  A few links to impart while we're waiting.   urlLink New VanderMeer Web site    urlLink New Ambergris Web site    urlLink City of Saints "tell all" article - part 1 , with part 2 to be posted sometime today. Part 2 is where it really gets interesting...  Thanks to Juha Lindroos for creating the sites, and to Rick Kleffel for running the article.  By 8am I'll be in England. I'm giddy as a school girl.  Cheers,  Jeff

      Here's another excerpt from Shriek. It's currently about 117,000 words, will probably top out after revisions at about 120,000 words. In terms of manuscript pages, it's about 450 pages!! Unbelievable. The longest fiction I've ever done. With any luck, I will finish the final revisions by Wednesday or Thursday.  Some of you have probably already guessed that although the main narrative is by Janice Shriek, the parenthetical asides have been added by her brother, Duncan.  Shriek is the most autobiographical fiction I've ever written, although it may not always be obvious to the reader. In the case of this scene, the forest is the forest I remember from camp outside of Ithaca, New York, when I was 10 or 11 years old. The salamanders, the mushrooms, the fire flies, are wonderful moments of discovery from that trip, which was mostly a hike up the side of a very long, large hill, into virgin forest, dark and dank and mysterious.  Note: This is still next-to-final draft, so there will be some awkwardness and a few typos, of course.  Jeff   Can a childhood memory be misconstrued as starting over? I don’t think so. Not in this way: The forests outside Stockton remain as real to me as the humid, fungi-laden streets of Ambergris, maybe more so. The dark leaves, the mottled trunks, the sense of deep green shadows reflected on the windows of our house, as of a presence. All sorts of trees grew in  Stockton, but the difference between the staid oaks that lined our street and the mishapen, twisted, coiled welter of tree limbs in the forest seemed profound. It both reassured us and menaced us in our youth: limitless adventure, fear of the unknown.  Our house lay on the forest’s edge. The trees stretched on for hundreds of miles, over hills and curving down through valleys. (Various were the forest’s name, from the Western Forest to the Forest of Owls to Farely’s Forest, after the man who had first explored the area.) Stockton had been nestled comfortably on its eastern flank for centuries, feeding off of the timber, the sap, the animals that took shelter there. Even though Stockton was marginally to the south of Ambergris, across the River Moth from it, Stockton was much more temperate because of the forest. It never got as sweltering as Ambergris.  By the time I had turned thirteen and Duncan was nine, we had made the forest our own. We had colonized our tiny corner of it—cleared paths through it, made shelters from fallen branches, even started a tree house. Dad never enjoyed the outdoors, but sometimes we could persuade him to enter the forest to see our latest building project. Mom had a real fear of the forest—of any dark place, which may have come from growing up in Ambergris. (Perhaps, perhaps not. I never had the sense that growing up in Ambergris had been a trauma for her—she lived there during very calm times—but it is true she never talked about it.)  One day, Duncan decided we should be more ambitious. We had made a crude map of what we knew of the forest, and the great expanse labeled “Unknown” erked him. The forest was one thing that could genuinely be thought of as his, the one area where he did not mimic me, where I followed his lead.  We stood at the end of our most ambitious path. It petered out into bushes and pine needles and the thick trunks of trees, the bark scaly and dark. I breathed in the fresh-stale air, listened to the distant cry of a hawk, and tried to hear the rustlings of mice and rabbits in the underbrush. We were already more than half a mile from our house.  Duncan peered into the forest’s depths.  “We need to go farther,” he said.  Back then, he was a thin little kid, small for his age, his shocking blonde hair beginning to turn brown. His bright blue eyes sometimes seemed too large for his face. He liked to wear long green shirts with brown shorts and sandals. He said it served as a kind of camouflage. I used to wear the same thing, although, oddly enough, it scandalized Mom. Dad could have cared less. (Camouflage or comfort—I don’t remember.)  “How much farther?” I asked.  I had become increasingly aware that our parents counted on me to keep watch over Duncan. Ever since he’d gotten trapped in the tunnel the year before, we’d all become more conscious of Duncan’s reckless curiosity.  “I don’t know,” he said. “If I did, it wouldn’t be much of an adventure. But there’s something out there, something we need to find.”  His expression was mischevious, yes, but also, somehow, otherworldly. (Otherworldly? I was nine. There was nothing “otherworldly” about me. I liked to belch at the dinner table. I liked to blow bubbles and play with metal soldiers and read books about pirates and talking bears.)  “But there’s all that bramble,” I said. “It will take ages to clear it.”  “No,” he said, with a sudden sternness I found endearing, and a little ridiculous, coming from such a gangly frame. “No. We need to go out exploring. No more paths. We don’t need paths.”  “Well...,” I said, about to give Duncan my next objection.  But he was already off, tramping through the bramble like some pint-sized version of the Kalif, determined to claim everything he saw for the Empire. He had always been fast, the kind to set out obstinantly for whatever goal beckoned, whatever bright and shiny thing caught his eye. Usually, I had control over him. Usually, he wanted to stay on my good side. But when it came to the forest, our relationship always changed, and he led the way.  So off he dashed into the forest, and I followed, of course. What choice did I have? Not that I hated following him. Sometimes, because of Duncan, I was able to do things I wouldn’t have done otherwise. And, such a relief, when I followed him, the weight of being the eldest lifted from me—such a rare thing, even BDD.   The forest in that place had a gathered, a concentrated, darkness to it because of the thick underbrush and the way the leaves and needles of the trees diluted the sun’s impact. To find a patch of golden sunlight in the gloom was like finding gold, but only accentuated the surrounding darkness all the more. The smell of rot caused by shadow was a healthy smell—I didn’t mind it; it meant that all of the forest still worked to fulfill its cycle, even down to the smallest insect tunneling through dead wood. It did not mean what it would come to mean in Ambergris.  Duncan and I fought our way through and over stickery vines and close-clumped bushes. We felt our way over fallen trees, stopping in places to investigate nests of flame-colored salamanders and stipplings of rust-red mushrooms. The forest fit us snugly; we were neither claustrophobic nor free of its influence. The calls of birds grew strange, shrill, and then died away altogether. It was as if we had entered another world. (As if we had gone through a door to a different place, a different time, Janice. I could not believe, sometimes, while in the forest, that it existed in the same world as our house.)  At times, the ground rose to an incline and we would trudging, our legs lifting for the next step with a grinding effort. The few clearings became less frequent, and then for a long time we walked through a dusk of dark-green vegetation under a canopy of trees like black marble columns, illuminated only by the stuttering glimmer of a firefly, or even just the repetitive clicking of some insect. A smell like ashes mixed with hay surrounded us. We had both begun to sweat, despite the coolness of the season, and I could hear even undaunted Duncan breathing heavily. We had come a long way, and I wasn’t sure I could find the route back to our familiar paths. Yet something about this quest, this foolhardy plunge forward, became hypnotic. A part of me could have kept on going hour after after hour, with no end in sight, and been satisfied with that uncertainty. (Then you knew how I have felt my entire adult life—except, we’re told there is no uncertainty, Janice. No one makes it out, we’re told, from birth until our deathbed, in a thousand spoken and unspoken ways.)  The sting, the burn, of hard exercise, the doubled excitement and fear of the unknown, kept me going for a long time.  But, finally, I reached a point where fear overcame excitement. (You mean common sense overcame excitement.)  “Duncan!” I said finally, to his back. “We have to stop. We need to find our way home.”  He turned then, his hand on a tree trunk for support—a shadow framed by a greater gloom—and I’ll never forget what he said. He said, “There is no way to go but forward, Janice. If we go forward, we will find our way back.”  It sounded like something Dad would have said, not a nine-year-old kid.  “We’re already lost, Duncan. We have to go back.”  Duncan shook his head. “I’m not lost. I know where we are. We’re not there yet. I know something important lies ahead of us. I know it.”  “Duncan,” I said, “you’re wearing sandals. Your feet must be pretty badly cut up by now.”  “No,” he said, “I’m fine.” (I wasn’t fine. My feet had been lacerated by the bramble, but I’d decided to block out that discomfort because it was unimportant.)  “There’s something ahead of us,” he repeated.  “Yes, more forest,” I said. “It goes on for hundreds of miles.” I thought about whether I had the strength to carry a kicking, struggling Duncan all the way back to the house. Probably not.  I looked up, the long trunks of trees reaching toward a kaleidoscope of wheeling, dimly light-spackled upper branches, amid a welter of leaves. In those few places where the light was right, I could see, floating, spore and dust and strands of cobweb. Even the air between the trees was thick with the detritus of life, and as I type these words I wonder now if the underground is anything like deep forest, because I became accustomed to the deep forest that day. (It’s more intense underground, Janice, because you can’t match what you’re seeing to anything you’ve experienced before.)  “Trust me,” Duncan said, and grinned. He headed off again, at such a speed that I again had no choice but to follow him. In the shadows my brother’s thin, wiry frame resembled more the thick, muscular body of a man. Was there any point at which he would stop, or I could convince him to stop?  Another half-hour or so—just as I could no longer identify our direction, soo too I had begun to lose my sense of time—and a thick, suffocating panic had begun to overcome me. We were lost.  We would never make it home. (You should have trusted me. You will need to trust me.) 	 But Duncan kept walking forward, into the unknown, through bramble and brush, over half-rotted tree branches, the thick loam of the forest floor rising at times to his ankles.  Then, to my relief, the undergrowth thinned, the trees became larger but spread farther apart. Soon, we could walk unimpeded, over a velvety compost of earth covered with moist leaves and pine needles. A smell arose from the ground, a rich smell, almost like coffe or muted mint. I heard again the hawk that had been wheeling overhead earlier, and an owl in the murk above us.  Duncan stopped for me then. He must have known how tired and thirsty I was, because he took my hand in his, and smiled as he said, “I think we are almost there. I think we almost are.”  We had reached the heart—or a heart—of the forest, I think. We had reached a place that in a storm would be called the eye. The light that shown through from above did so in shafts as thin as the green fractures of light I can see from the corner of my eye as I type up this account. And in those shafts, the dust motes floated yet remained perfectly still. Now I heard no sound but the pad of our feet against the loamy earth.  Duncan stopped. I was so used to hurrying to keep up that I almost bumped into him.  “There, see,” he said, pointing, a smile creasing his face.  And I did see, and gasped, for there, just ahead of us, stood a statue or idol.  Made of solid gray stone, riven through with fissures, splashed with light, overgrown with an emerald-and-crimson lichen, it depicted a face with large, wide eyes, a tiny nose, and a solemn mouth. The statue could not have been taller than three or four feet.  We walked closer, in an effortless glide, so enraptured by this vision, that we could forget the ache in our legs.  Iridescent beetles had woven themselves into the lichen bears of its smile, some flying around the object, effortless on their tiny wings, heavy bodies drooping below the wings. Other insects had hidden in the fissures of the stone. What looked like a wren’s nest decorated part of the top of the head. A whole miniature world had grown up around it. It was clearly the work of one of the native tribes that had fled into the interior when our ancestors had built Stockton and claimed the land around it. This much I knew from school.  “How?” I asked in amazement. “How did you know this was here, Duncan?”  Duncan smiled as he turned to me. “I didn’t. I just knew there had to be something, and if we kept looking long enough, we’d find it.”  At the time, while we stood there and drank in the odd beauty of the statue, and even as Duncan unerringly found our way home, and even after Mom and Dad, waiting in the backyard as the sun disappeared over the tree line, expressed their anger and disappointment at our “irresponsibility,” especially mine, I never once thought about whether Duncan might be crazy rather than lucky, touched rather than decisive. I just followed him. (Janice, I lied to you, just a little. It’s true I didn’t know exactly where to find the statue, but I had already heard about from one of the older students at our school. He’d given me enough information for me to get a fairly good idea of where to go. So it wasn’t preternatural on my part—it was based on a shred, a scrap, of information, as are all of my wanderings.)

       urlLink Secret Life  is officially out in the next week or so. Twenty-three stories taken from the last 18 years of my career, the first written when I was 16 or 17 and the last written just a few months ago. It is, basically, the definitive collection of my fiction. With an introduction by Jeffrey Ford.  Such a beast is, by its nature, somewhat perplexing to the author. Or at least, mine is to me. I've traveled a long distance as a writer since I was in my teens, and it doesn't just have to do with technique. It has to do with structure, form, narrative. Not so much finding a voice, because I think I've always had a strong authorial voice, but more about finding the best ways to give expression to the characters, images, plots, and themes I repeatedly tackle.  So when I read over these stories now, I see that although my themes--the nature of love, death, obsession, the imagination, and, yes, squid--have remained the same, I have tried a number of approaches.  Let me tell you what I like about the collection--the kind of private joy I get in perusing it, picking it up, thumbing through it. (I hate it when writers say they dislike re-reading their work in published form, by the way. You ought to be able to revel in it, to acknowledge, yes, that you know your weaknesses as well as your strengths, but also be happy and content with it as well.) But let me tell you what I like--I like that there's such diversity between almost pulpy fiction and literary, between the visceral and the intellectual, between the tale and the story. More than any other book, everything I am as a writer can be found in Secret Life, including the suggestion, the hint, of what the future holds.  A couple of the advance reviews have said that the stories often don't seem to be written by the same writer. For me, that's a high compliment. Much as I love Chagall, I like the model provided by Picasso better, in terms of how to approach the creation of art. I may always be gnawing at the same themes, the same questions (because they aren't questions that have set answers, or that will ever have set answers), but that doesn't mean I have to do so in the same style, with the same slant.  I tell you what thrills me immensely, even as it frightens me to death: Pushing myself to write something so new (for me) that it feels while writing this new thing that I have never written anything before. That's a pure feeling. You might fall on your face, but you might just do something original. And I think it's the best possible way to position yourself for inspiration.  I don't mean that "inspiration" always fuels good fiction. I just mean that one of the perks of being a writer, or any kind of creator, is that, sometimes, you get "written" as opposed to writing something. Call it a surge of adrenalin or something spiritual or just a few synapses recognizing the echo of a shadow of a brilliant idea that might, in some small way, make it half-whole onto the page, but regardless of what it is, it's the real reason I write--the immediate reason. There's no better feeling in the entire world.  In the final story in Secret Life, "Experiment #25," I describe this feeling from the writer main character's point of view:  "The writer picked up his cigar and breathed in its thickness. Take winter—such a bracing time of year, he thought, addressing the glowing red tip as if it were a good friend. Every detail on the sidewalk, from a rage of red-orange leaves to a green meandering crack in the concrete, took on a binocular significance. It was a forethought of the awareness that overtook him when he wrote: the premonition of something moving through him and onto the page, the pen in hand become a blur and the heart so full, limbs aflame, body with fever. Like sparks burrowing into you until, finally conquered, you become vessel, container not contained—trapped and free—and all the little hairs on your arms rise, and you feel as if your own skin has been painlessly flayed back to reveal, beneath the perfect diagram of veins and arteries, the beauty and horror of the world—the words like tiny mysteries and the combinations of words solutions to those mysteries, and yet more mysterious for the revelation...and you’re crying silently because, after all, these words are your life, even in distilled form, even brought forth by an unknown will...and you know this is the closest you will personally ever come to an awareness of what God might mean—this feeling that so encompasses the whole of your being that you are unimaginable strength and weakness intertwined...and in the aftermath, the writer often found, as the madness left him, that he would observe, say, the reflected worlds within a perfect drop of water as it lazed in the sudden sunlight across the yard, and was spent, exhausted, by even that simple image."  That's one of the places I want to be as a writer, whether what results from it is good or terrible. In reading over Secret Life, I remember how many times I'd be sitting in a room, alone but for the legal pad or the typewriter or the computer, and yet be overcome by an entire world, or a part of a world, that came exploding out of nowhere, headed for the page at a speed faster than conscious thought.  Anyway, Secret Life is out now and I'm going to enjoy it for all it's worth.  Jeff

      Yesterday was our second wedding anniversary. Ann has been putting up with my antics for over 13 years, but we finally got married two years ago, in Fort Lauderdale. We first met because she was editing The Silver Web and I'd been editing a magazine out of Gainesville, Florida, called Chimera Connections. I also had been submitting work to SW. For a few years, we were friends, and then started dating. I used to commute up to Tallahassee from Gainesville (about 2.5 hours) every weekend, when I could, before finally making the move up to Tallahassee in 1992. We've lived together ever since.  Ann's my first reader on all of my fiction and has had an enormous influence on every anthology I've ever edited, basically. Certainly, the Leviathan series has benefitted greatly from her experience, and from her expertise--I think she's the best general editor I've met, in terms of being able to read a story, no matter who it's from, and suss out how good it is, what its flaws/strengths are. This has been invaluable on the Leviathan series.  On my fiction, she has, as mentioned, the dubious distinction of reading it first and commenting on it. I'll give her something to read and she'll either take it to her day job to read at lunch or she'll read it at home. In the latter case, I will be trying very hard to project a sense of nonchalance while sweating bullets. She will read it while I'm either absent from the room or pretending to watch TV. Then she won't say anything, usually. She'll set it down and wait for me to ask her what she thought. There's this terrifying moment between asking the question and receiving the response that just opens up like an abyss. Luckily, she's usually fond of it, at the very least, but, still...I can't think of a better way to get my heart rate up...  On the new novel, on which the revisions are going nicely, Ann has been great. After reading it, she had several suggestions with regard to the characters that added so much.  Anyway, I couldn't do what I do without Ann, and I hope I'm as supportive of what she does as she is of what I do.  It's been two years (plus 11) and we're still going strong. I can't imagine life without her.  Jeff

      Since I switched to the new "skin" for this blog, I have lost (or misplaced) the comments on previous posts. I hope to restore both the comments AND my links to other blogs soon.   In the meantime, I'm curious as to how many people visit and read this blog. Am I writing for an audience of three or four, or more? Let me know by posting a comment to this thread. I'd like a sense of whether I should continue to spend time on this blog.  Jeff

      I'm sure most readers of this blog are already aware of the charity auction to help Charles L. Grant, noted horror writer and author. There are about 3 days left in the auction, and all of the money is going to basically help keep Grant alive. For the details about his illness, go to  urlLink this site   The auction includes lots of items by writers such as Peter Straub, China  Mieville, etc., and you can bid on items  urlLink here .  I've contributed several items, which are being offered in  urlLink one lot .  The items I've sent in include a copy of the Finnish Exchange (which you just can't get here), a regular Exchange (but one of the numbered signed copies that were meant for the deluxe Exchange, we just never put them together), a signed first edition of my Secret Life collection, a signed edition of the book publication of Dradin, In Love (often selling for $125 to $150 from book dealers), and a copy of the 100-copy Eric Schaller-illustrated chapbook of the "Secret Life" story, which I only printed up for close friends and family. This will be the only copy ever "sold" as it were.  All by way of saying--go check out the auction, help out a writer who really needs it right now...  Jeff

      For the last few years,  urlLink Savoy  (Michael Butterworth, David Britton, John Coulthart), operating out of Manchester, England, has published some of the most beautifully-made books in the world--and not only beautifully-made, but classics. From a reissue of  Voyage to Arcturus  to Colin Wilson's  The Killer  to  The Adventures of Engelbrecht , Savoy has made the statement that wherever truly original, truly inspired, and often quite surreal and daft books lurk, Savoy will be there to publish them in stunning editions (designed by John Coulthart).  But the story of Savoy is much more than just these past few books--it extends back into the era of Michael Moorcock's  New Worlds  magazine, when Savoy published paperbacks of work by Moorcock, Ellison, and others, and had a profound influence on the British publishing scene--not just because of the books they published, but because of their attitude toward those books, and their willingness to push the boundaries of what the English authorities in Manchester would deem acceptable to publish, and what they wouldn't. As a result, many thousands of books were, at various times, seized by the police, and Savoy threatened with going out of business more than once.  Yet they've soldiered on and, although their books no longer reach the broader audience of the 1970s, they've continued to be one of the best independent presses in the world. To my mind, based on the last five or six books I've seen, they are  the  best independent press in the world--considering the quality of the content, the quality of the design, and the quality of the materials used to make the books.  Their latest project may seem self-serving, but it isn't.   urlLink A Serious Life  , a 400-plus page book compiled by D.M. Mitchell, provides an overview and indepth examination of Savoy's history and its impact on popular culture, including music and comic books. Mitchell's approach is to combine interviews with Savoy's founders with his own commentary on the press in the form of interconnected essays. Some deal with the "theory" behind Savoy. Some deal with particular topics, such as Savoy's relationship to the music scene. Some serve to provide a historical backdrop. All are incisive and fascinating. While it is true that some of the claims made about Savoy's influence may seem extravagant, it really doesn't matter if they're accurate or not--the context in which they're placed is intrinsically interesting. Even if you don't care even a tiny bit about Savoy, you'll still enjoy this book.   Sections on Michael Moorcock and New Worlds are of particular interest, but there isn't a page--all of which include a plethora of well-placed photographs and illustrations--that doesn't provoke thought or further discussion. Blake, Burroughs, and all of your other favorites make appearances.It is the kind of book that's sharp around the edges, but don't worry if you cut yourself on it. It's a pleasurable kind of pain.  What I love about this book is that it portrays Savoy as unrependent, defiant, and still, after all of these years, committed to a subversive, idiosyncratic publishing agenda. Given the constant harrassment Savoy has suffered from the British police over the years, this is an achievement in and of itself. But what I love  even more  is that the book is an extremely way of saying  fuck you  to Savoy's enemies.   What better way to do that than with a book so lovingly made that it's likely to survive the Apocalypse?   A Serious Life  is likely to top my best-of-the-year list, and I can't think of any other book that you should hurry up and buy  right now  while there are still some left.

      If it wasn't obvious before, it should be obvious by now that we have a moron for a president--corrupt, incompetent, venal, surrounded by like-minded liars. We are now living in a culture where our government uses torture as a  routine  matter of policy and in which the government, and many of our citizens, see all Moslems, all Arabs, as terrorists. A country in which our government has worked very hard to bring a nonsensical illogic to such issues as who was responsible for 911 and who wasn't. That some congressmen can actually express more outrage over the release of photographs depicting torture than the actions depicted in them is not only nauseating--it reflects a basic lack of humanity. The only correct solution is to leave Iraq, immediately. The only correct solution is to put Bush and his cronies out on the street in November.  Thus endeth the political commentary in this blog. However, I would draw your attention to three wonderful blogs that are doing a great job of sharing information, and a Web site that is doing the same. All four, in their way, are doing things I wish I could do, but also doing them better than I could.

      Oddly enough, it ended less than dramatically, given all the build-up. From Friday night of last week through Sunday, I wrote about 27 hours and finished off a good working draft of Shriek. Once I got going, I found I just couldn't stop. Everything that I had found murky became clear and the sheer energy of writing hurriedly and without many breaks took care of the rest. Now I have a good working draft of the novel, much of it fourth or fifth draft, with a few rough spots that I'll need to smooth out. I've already begun the revisions phase and am averaging about 6,000 words a day in rewrites. At this pace, I'll have it in shape except for a final copy-edit by the third week of May at the latest. With any luck, I'll have the book turned in to my agent by June 1st.  I've been working on this novel since 1998 and many times felt that I might not finish it, even while feeling compelled to finish it. Being able to express my frustration on this blog, no matter how much like whining it might have sounded at times, has helped me to keep going and to blow off some steam.  This novel is unlike anything else I've ever done, and also much longer than any fiction I've completed before. I'm excited about getting it in print in part for that very reason.  Thanks to everyone who encouraged me to keep going and who listened to my bitching and moaning.  Jeff

      I'm to that point where I hate Shriek: An Afterword so much that I want to throw up. I've looked at it so much that it's just splatters of indifferent ink on an equally indifferent page. And I'm not joking. I absolutely loathe it right now.  I think this is a fairly common occurrence with writers. At some point, the text becomes inert, lifeless, and you just have to set it aside. So, with that cheery intro, here's one last excerpt from Shriek...(Again, there WILL be typos and misspellings and all the rest...)  Jeff  Can I start again? Will you let me start again? Do you trust me to? Perhaps not. Perhaps all I can do is soar over, or glide over. Perhaps we’ll just fly as a crow flies—on night wings, wind rattling the delicate bones of the rib cage, cold singeing feathers, eye scouring the ground below us. The landscape will seem clear but distant, remote yet comprehensible. We will fly for ten years straight, through cold and rain and the occasional indignant sparrow certain we’ve come to raid the nest. Ten years shall we fly across before we begin our slow, circling descent to the cause of Duncan’s calamity. Five books for those ten years. Five black books flapping their pages. Five reluctant tombstones. Five millstones round my brother’s neck. Five brilliant bursts of quicksilver communication. Five leather-clad companions for Duncan that no one can ever take away from him. (Five progressively grandiose statements that stick in my craw. Get on with it!)  We fly this way because we must fly this way. I did not see much of Duncan during those ten years. The morning after my conversation with him, he borrowed money from me against expected book royalties, and left my apartment. He rented a small one bedroom loft at the east end of Albumuth Boulevard in one of the several buildings owned by the legendary Dame Truff. Did he delight in living so close to the Religious Quarter, to know that he, the blasphemer, slept within a few blocks of the Antechamber’s quarters in the Truffidian Cathedral? I don’t know. I never asked him. (Trust me—the answer is too mundane to include.)  While Duncan published, I perished half a dozen times. I shed careers like snake skins, molting toward a future I always insisted was a goal, not mere destination. Painter, sculptor, teacher, gallery assistant, journalist, gallery owner. A necklace quite as bright, quite as fake, as Mary Sabon’s. I never finished anything, from the great sprawling canvases I filled with images of a city I didn’t understand, to the great sprawling spaces in my gallery. I’ve never lacked the energy or the drive, only that fundamental secret all good art has and all bad art lacks: a healthy imagination. Which is ironic, considering how much imagination it has taken to get where I am at this moment, typing up this afterwards.  I did my best to keep in contact with Duncan, although without much enthusiasm or vigor. The long trek to his loft apartment from mine usually ended in disappointment; he was rarely home. Sometimes, curious, I would sneak up to the door and listen carefully before knocking; I would have looked through the keyhole, but it revealed only darkness.  My reward for spying usually took the form of a rather echoing silence. But more than once I imagined I heard someone or something scuttling across the floor, accompanied by a dull hiss and moan that made me stand up abruptly, the hairs rising on my arms. My tremulous knock upon the door in such circumstances—whether Duncan Transformed or Duncan with Familiars, I wanted no part of that sound—was usually enough to re-establish silence on the other side. And if not, my retreat back into the street usually changed from walk to run. (I heard you sometimes, although sometimes I was engrossed in my work; best you did not enter. Ironically enough, a couple of times, I thought you were them, graycapped sister.)  I imagine I looked rather pathetic in front of his apartment—this thin, small woman crouched against a splintery door, eagerly straining for any aural news of the interior. I remember the accursed doorknob well—I hit my head on it at least three times.  Thwarted, I gained any news of Duncan from rare interviews in the newspapers, which usually focused on writing technique or opinions on current events. For some reason, people are under the deluded impression that a historian—blessed with hindsight—can somehow illuminate the present and the future. Duncan knew nothing about the present and the future. (Or the immediate past. Not really.)  The biographical notes on the backs of his books were no help—they crackled with a terseness akin to fear: “Duncan Shriek lives in Ambergris. He is working on another book.” Even by investigating the spaces between the words, those areas where silence might reveal a clue, could anyone ever “get to know” the author from such a truncated paragraph? More importantly, no one would ever want to know the author from such a paragraph. Only in the fifth book did more information leak through, almost by accident, like a water stain on a ceiling: “Shriek intends to write a sequel to his bestselling tome, Cinsorium.”  By then, Duncan's luck had run its course, and all because of a single book we must circle back to, Sabon as raptor swooping down to observe, delighted, over our feathered shoulder--doubling, trebling, the scope of the disaster, because it was you, Mary, who turned Duncan into fodder for your own…what shall we call it? Words fail/cannot express/are not nearly enough. (Triumph. Unqualified. You must give her that. Bewitching eyes and the pen of a poet.)  Gliding, wheeling, we circle back through the windstream and let the titles fall in reverse order that we might approach the source by a series of echoes or ripples: Vagaries of Circumstance and Fate Amongst the Clans of the Aan, Mapping the Beast: Interrogatories Between the Moth and Those Who Travel Its Waters; Stretcher Jones: Last Hope of the West, Language Barriers Between the Aan and the Saphant Empire. And the first book, stretching out below us in all of its baroque immensity: Cinsorium: Dispelling the Myth of the Gray Caps. This maddening book, composed of lies and half-truths, glitters beneath us in all of its slivers and broken pieces, baubles fit for our true crow-self. 	 What is it about even a half-life that can tear at the fabric of the world? Was it fear? Guilt? The same combination of emotions that flickered through my thoughts as I extinguished the welter of mushrooms from Duncan's poor pale body?  I don't mean to speak in riddles. I don't mean to fly too high above the subject, but sometimes you have no choice. Still, let me land our weary crow and just tell the story. (Thank Truff!)   Perhaps Duncan should have realized what he had done after Frankwrithe & Lewden's reaction to the manuscript. (I realized it earlier, when I read over the first draft, the thousand red wounds of revision marks—lacerations explaining in their cruel tongue that this would either be a book, or no book at all.)  A month after submission of the book, Duncan's editor, Mr. John Lewden, summoned Duncan to F&L's offices in downtown Morrow. The journey from Ambergris took Duncan two grueling days up river by barge, into the heart of what proved to be a glacial Morrow winter. Once there, Duncan found that his editor was “on vacation” and that F&L's president, Mr. L. Gaudy, would talk to him instead.  A secretary quickly escorted Duncan into Gaudy's office, and left immediately. (I remember the office quite well. It was “resplendent,” with a rosewood desk, a dozen portraits of famous F&L authors, and an angry, spitting fireplace strategically placed in the corner opposite the desk.)  Gaudy, according to Duncan's journal, was “a bearded man of indeterminate age, his gaunt flesh wrapped across sharp cheekbones.” He sat behind his desk, staring at the room's fireplace. (His eyes were like blue ice, and in his presence I smelled a certain cloying mustiness, as if he spent most of his time underground, or surrounded by hundred-year-old books.)  Duncan moved to sit, but Gaudy raised one hand, palm out, in abeyance. The calm behind the gesture, almost trance-like, made him reluctant to disobey the man, but “also irritated me intensely; I had the feeling he knew something I did not, something I wanted to know.”  They remained in those positions, respectively sitting and standing, for over five minutes. Duncan somehow sensed that just as he should not sit down, he also should not speak. “I began to think this man held some power over me, and it was only later that I realized something in his eyes reminded me of dad.”  When Gaudy finally lifted his bespectacled face to stare at Duncan, the flames reflected in the glass, Duncan saw an expression of absolute peace on the man’s face. Relieved, he again moved to sit down, only to again be told, through a gesture, to remain standing.  Duncan began to wonder if his publisher had gone insane. “At the very least, I wondered if he had mistaken me for someone else.”  As the fire behind them began to die, Gaudy smiled and broke the silence. He spoke in a “perfectly calm voice, level and smooth. He stared at the fireplace as he spoke, and steepled his fingers, elbows on the desk. He appeared not to draw a single extra breath.”  He said:  “You need not sit and thus defile my perfectly good chair because it will take no time at all to say what needs to be said to you. Once I have said what I am going to say to you, I would like you to leave immediately and never return. You are no longer welcome here and never will be welcome again. Your manuscript has just performed the useful function of warming us, a function a thousand times more beneficial than anything it might have hoped to accomplish as a series of letters strung together into words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and chapters. The fire has purified it, in much the same manner as I would like at this moment—and at all moments in the future—to purify you, were it not outside of the legal, if not moral, boundaries placed upon us by the law and society in general. By this time it ought to be clear to you, Mr. Shriek, that we do not intend to buy the rights to your ‘book,’ and I use the word ‘book’ in its loosest possible sense, nor to its ashes, although I would sooner buy the rights to its ashes than to its unblemished pages. However, on the off chance that you still do not comprehend what I am saying to you, and allowing for the possibility that you may have entered a state of shock, I shall continue to talk until you leave this room, which happy event I hope will take place before very much longer, as the sight of you makes me ill. Mr. Shriek, as you must be aware, Frankwrithe & Lewden has a history that goes back more than five hundred years, and in that time we have published our share of controversial books. Your first book—which, by the way, you may be fascinated to know is as of this moment out-of-print—was the forty-first book to be banned by the various Antechambers of Ambergris over the years. We certainly have no qualms in that regard. Nor have we neglected to publish books on the most arcane and obscure topics dreamt of by the human brain. As you are no doubt aware, we keep our entire, and considerable, back list in print—with the exception of your first book, of course, which shall be banished from all of our catalogues as well—despite the fact that many titles no longer have even a nostalgic relevance; Pelagic Snail Rituals of the Lower Archipelago comes to mind, there being no such snail still extant, nor such an archipelago; still, we keep it in print. As I would have hoped you had guessed by now, although you have not yet left this office never to return, we do not like your new book very much. In fact, to say I do not like your book would be like calling a mighty tree a seedling. I loathe your book, Mr. Shriek, and yet the word ‘loathe’ cannot convey in even a thousandth part the full depths of my hatred for this book, and by extension, you. But perhaps I should be more specific. Maybe specifics will allow you to overcome this current, potentially fatal, inertia—tied no doubt to the aforementioned shock—that stops you from leaving this office. Oh look-the last scrap of your manuscript has just become a flake of ash floating above the fireplace. What a shame. Perhaps you would like an urn to collect the ashes of your dead new-born? Well, you can’t, because not only do we not have an urn, but even if we did, we would not allow you to use it for the transport of the ashes, if only from the fear that you might find some way to reconstruct the book from them—and yes we do know it is likely you have a copy of the manuscript, but we feel a certain warmth in our hearts if we can at least slow down your reckless and obstinate attempt to publish this cretinous piece of excrement. Returning to the specifics of our argument against this document: Your insipid stupidity is evident from the first word of the first sentence of the first paragraph of your acknowledgments page, ‘The,’ and from there the sense of simple-minded, pitiable absence of thought pervades all of the first paragraph until, by the roaring crescendo of imbecility that forms the last word of the first paragraph, ‘again,’ any possible authority the reader might have granted the author has been completely undermined by your inability to in any way convey even an unoriginal thought. And yet in comparison to the dull-witted pedantics of the second paragraph, the first paragraph positively shines with genius and degenerate brilliance. Perhaps at this point in our little chat, I should repeat that I don’t very much like this book.”  Gaudy then rose and shouted, “YOU HAVE BEEN MEDDLING IN THINGS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT! DO YOU THINK YOU CAN POKE AROUND DOWN THERE WITH IMPUDENCE AND NOT HAVE CONSEQUENCES?! YOU ARE A COMPLETE AND UTTER MORON! IF YOU EVER COME BACK TO MORROW, I’LL HAVE YOU GUTTED AND YOUR ORGANS THROWN TO THE DOGS! DO. YOU. UNDERSTAND. ME??!”  What other rhetorical gems might have escaped Gaudy’s lips, we will never know, for Duncan chose that moment to overcome his inertia and leave Frankwrithe & Lewden’s offices—forever.  “It’s not so much that he frightened me,” Duncan told me later. “Because after going below ground, really, what could scare me? It was the monotone of his delivery until that last spit-tinged frothing.” (I was terrified, Janice. This man was the head of an institution that had been extant more than five hundred years ago. And he was telling me my work was worthless! It took a month before I even had the nerve to leave my apartment in Ambergris. I never did visit Morrow again.)  Later, during the War of the Houses, as it came to be called, we realized that Gaudy could hardly have reacted any other way to Duncan’s manuscript, but how could Duncan know that at the time? He must have been shaken, at least a little bit. (Yes. A bit.)  Still, undaunted, Duncan found a publisher within six months of Gaudy’s strange rejection. Hoegbotton Publishing, a newly-created and over-eager division of the Hoegbotton & Sons trading empire, gave Duncan his contract. In every way, the book struck Duncan’s new editor, Samuel Hoegbotton—an overbearing and inconsequential young man with hulking shoulders, a voice like a cacophony of monkeys, and severe bad breath—as “A WORK OF GENIUS!” Duncan was happy to agree, bewildered as he might have been, unaware at the time that Samuel had transferred from the Hoegbotton Marketing Division. Samuel had not set foot in a bookstore since his twelfth birthday, when his mother had presented him with a gift certificate to the Borges Bookstore. (“Promptly traded in for the monetary value,” Sirin, our subsequent editor, mused disbelievingly some years later.) That Samuel died of a heart attack soon after publishing Duncan’s fifth book surprised no one. (Except me!)

      It took six years, with innumerable other projects getting in the way, but as of lunch today, Shriek: An Afterword is complete. Tomorrow it goes off to my agent and we'll see what happens. In part, Shriek took six years because I had to learn how to write it--parts of it I didn't have the ability to write back in 1998. This is a novel in which the landscape of Ambergris recedes a bit and the main characters stand out in sharp relief against its outline, which is different from City of Saints, where many of the characters were fully-rounded, but so was the city. This time, I wanted to pull back from the pseudo-Victorian feel of City of Saints and write in a more informal style. I feel as if this is a break through novel for me, for a number of reasons. First, it's the first real novel I've written. Veniss is only 53,000 words, while Shriek is currently 125,000. Second, it marks a definite change of emphasis and style. Third, it's intensely personal for me in that many of the events or anecdotes that comprise part of the plot are autobiographical. I've been able to write about things, for the first time, that I wasn't sure I'd ever have the proper distance from.  Now I'll set it aside for a couple of weeks, then go through it for a final copy edit and perhaps a couple of scene additions or deletions, while it goes out to publishers. I'm a compulsive editor and believe that time away from a completed novel is the only way to gain objectivity. At the same time, I'm confident it's in extremely good shape and ready for editors to see it.  My friend Neil Williamson sent me a book by Ian M. Banks about scotch and Scotland on the stipulation I only read it when I finish the novel. I think I'll indulge in it sometime this evening, along with a nice bottle of English hard cidar and, possibly, a good cigar.  Jeff

      I'm going to post some entries about books I've read recently, in particular Peck's Hatchet Job and another one about literary forgeries, particular passages from which have had a certain resonance for me in light of blog entries by Matthew Cheney and others of late. But, for now, another unmoored excerpt from Shriek. A bit of a teaser, really...As before--this is still rough text, so typos, etc., will abound.  Jeff   There came a night so terrible that no one ever dared to name it. There came a night so terrible that I could not. There came a night so terrible that no one could explain it. There came the most terrible of nights. No, that’s not right, either. There came the most terrible of nights. There came the most terrible of nights that could not be forgotten, or forgiven, or even named. That’s closer, but sometimes I choose not to revise. Let it be raw and awkward splayed across the page, as it was in life.  Words would be offered up like “atrocity,” “massacre,” and “madness,” but I reject those words. They did not, could not, cannot, contain what they need to contain.  Could we have known? Could we have wrenched our attention from our more immediate concerns long enough to understand the warning signs? Now, of course, it all seems clear enough. As Duncan had said, the war could not continue in the same way for very long.  As soon as Duncan and I saw Voss Bender’s blind, blindingly white head floating down the River Moth, just two days before the Festival, we should have had a clue.  “There’s a sight you don’t see very often,” Duncan said, as we sat on an abandoned pier and watched the head and the barge that carried it slowly pull away into the middle of the river.  A kind of lukewarm sun shone that day, diluted by swirls of fog.  “It’s a sight I’ve never seen before, Duncan,” I replied.  F&L had cut apart a huge marble statue of Voss Bender that had stood in the Religious Quarter for almost twenty years and loaded it, piece by piece, onto the barge, displaying a remarkably dextrous use of pulleys and levers. There lay the pieces of Bender, to all sides of his enormous, imperious, crushingly heavy head. About to disappear up the River Moth. As vulnerable-looking in that weak sunlight as anything I had ever seen.  “I wonder what the people who live along the banks of the river will think about it,” I said.  “What do you mean?” Duncan asked.  "Will they see it as the demolition, the destruction, of a god, or will they be strangely unmoved.”  Duncan laughed. “I’m strangely unmoved.” 	 We were both a little rattled from a close call the day before, when we had arrived at what was supposedly the scene of a bomb attack, only to find the bombs exploding as we got there. My hair was dirty and streaked with black from the explosion. My face had suffered a half-dozen abrasions. Duncan had had a thumbnail-sized chunk of his ear blown off. Already, it had begun to regenerate.  “Well, I think it’s sad,” I said. “They’re carting off all of our valuables, like common thieves.”  Until then, F&L had contented themselves with bombing us silly day and night. The steady stream of goods, art, and statuary had only started heading north in the past week. It should have been a clear sign that the war was about to change, again. After all, who did F&L seem to have a direct line to, what with their fungal mines, bombs, and bullets? I don’t think I have to spell it out.  “Actually, Janice,” Duncan said, as he dipped his toes in the Moth, “I hesitate to try to convince you otherwise, but I think the sight of Voss Bender’s head floating vaingloriously down the Moth is very funny. So much effort by old F&L, and for what? What can they possibly think they will do with these ‘remains’ when they reach Morrow? Rework the marble into columns for some public building? Reassemble it—and if so, where in Truff’s name would they put it? We hardly knew where to put it ourselves.”  “Maybe you’re right,” I said, “but it still doesn’t mean it can’t be sad, too.”   Did I already say that there came to be the most terrible of Festival nights?   Our father had never had anything to say about the Festival (not true!), at least that I can remember, but he said one or two things about the gray caps. I recall that at the dinner table he would ramble on about his current studies. He had no gift for providing context. He would sit at the table, looking down at his mashed potatoes as he scratched the back of his head with one hand and pushed his fork through his food and back again with the other. There was always about him at these times a far-away look, as if he were figuring something out in his head even as he talked to us. Sometimes, it would be a kind of muttering chant, under his breath. Other times he was genuinely talking to us but really elsewhere. He smelled of limes back then, our mother having insisted he wear some cologne to combat the smell of old books brought back from the rare book room of the Stockton Library. But since he hated cologne, he would cut up a lime instead and annoint himself with its juice. (I enjoyed that smell of books, though, missed it when it was gone--it was a comfortable, old-fashioned smell, usually mixed with the dry spice of cigar smoke. I came to feel that it was the smell of knowledge, which provoked not the sweat of physical exertion, but the sweat of mental exertion. Book must and cigar smoke were the product of working brains, to me.)  At one such dinner, he looked up at us and he said, "The gray caps are quite simple, really. I don't know why I didn't think of this before. So long as what you're doing doesn't interfere with their plans, they don't care what you do--even if you cause one of them physical harm. But if somehow you step across the trip wire of one of their 'activities,' why, then, there is nothing that can save you."  (I remember that, too, almost exactly as you do. I especially remember "trip wire," a word I'd never heard before he used it. Why did he use that word? It fascinated me. And when I was studying at the Morrow Religious Institute, I began to wonder--had the Silence been caused by some kind of triggering of a "trip wire"? To this day, all evidence for and against in front of me, I'm not sure what to think.)  We were to find out during the Festival of the Freshwater Squid that year just what happened when Ambergris collectively sprung a trip wire. For the bad festival was like the antithesis of the Silence--sent to convince us that any semblance of law in the city was illusory, that it could not truly exist, whether we thought it resided in the palm of an obese, elderly Hoegbotton, a thin, ancient Frankwrithe, or the wizened visage of a Kalif none of us had ever seen.  The night of the Festival, the sun set red over the River Moth. Most of the crepe paper lanterns that people had set out had already been crushed by rubble or by the motored vehicles of opposing forces. The Kalif's men had stepped up their bombardment of the city from without. They made no pretense any more of aiming at anything in particular, their strikes as random as the startled flight of pigeons trying to avoid the crossfire. Their bombs were as likely to crack open a hospital ward as a Hoegbotton sentry post. A certain fatality had crept into the minds of the survivors as a result. Really, it was as random as a heart attack. Why worry about what you cannot defend against? So we walked the streets as calmly as before, when we weren't hunkered down from real threats--like a fungal bullet to the brain from some trigger-happy F&L recruit.  No, what terrified me, as I looked out from my apartment at dusk, was the proliferation of red flags.  On the way back from our journalistic assignments that day, before we turned in our now infamous "F&L Yearns for Every Ambergrisian's Head" article, the flags of the gray caps had appeared in multitudes—rhapsodies of red that seemed, like the ever-present fungus, always on the verge of forming some pattern, some message, only to fall apart into chaos again.   As we approached Lacond's offices in the late afternoon, the wind picked up. It rattled the gravel on side streets. It brought with it a strange premature twilight, and a smell that none could identify. Was it a smell come up off the river? It seemed bitter and pleasant, sharp and diffuse, all at once.  The light, as Martin Lake might have said, had become different in Ambergris.  We left Lacond's offices tired and ready for rest, Duncan to his apartment with Mary, me to my own place much further down Albumuth Boulevard, in the opposite direction. (Not even Lacond could demand we cover the Festival, not that year.) Sybel had decided to take me up on my invitation that he stay with me that night, just in case. Either we'd celebrate the festival together or defend ourselves against it. (I left ample protections; I'm sorry they were not enough.) We had all been through many festivals. We were old pros at it. We knew how to handle it.  I had thought about making the trek to our mother's mansion, but Duncan had assured me he could keep her safe. (She was quite safe--far enough upriver that the Kalif's men had not requisitioned the house, and far enough from Ambergris that she would come to no harm from the gray caps. I made sure this; I may have even mentioned it to you, but I don't think you were listening.)  Dusk had become night by the time Sybel arrived, breathless from running. After I let him in, I bolted the door behind him.  “It's not good out there," he said, gasping for breath. “There's a silence that's…like I imagine the Silence must have been.”  There was a thought. I felt light-headed for an instant, a conjoined chill and thrill. What if, tonight, we were to experience what the 25,000 had experienced during the Silence? The city once again become a vast experiment, if Duncan was to be believed.  "Nonsense," I said. "It's just another festival Help me with this."  We pushed a set of cabinets up against the door.  "That should do it," I said.  Outside, we could hear a few dozen drunken youths pass by, shouting as they stumbled their way past.  “Death to the Kalif!” I heard, and a flurry of cursing.  “They’ll be lucky if they survive the hour,” Sybel said. “And it won’t be the Kalif that kills them, either.”  “When did you become so cheerful?” I asked.  He just gave me a look and went back to loading his gun. We had pistols and knives, which Sybel had managed to purchase from, of all people, a Kalif officer; there was a booming black market in weapons these days. Some wags speculated that the Kalif had invaded Ambergris mostly to sell off some inventory.  Meanwhile, the gray caps had spores and fungal bombs, and Truff knew what else.  “Do you think we’re much safer in here?” I asked.  Sybel smiled. “No. Not much safer.”  There seemed about him that night more than a hint of self-awareness, mixed with that rarest of commodities for Sybel: self-contentment. I could be wrong, of course.  We didn’t board up the window until much later, fearful of losing the thread of what was going on outside. The full moon drooped in the sky, almost as if soggy—an egg white, a yolk. Through that smudged fog of glass, we watched rivulets and outcroppings of the festival walk or run by. Clowns and magicians and stiltmen and ordinary citizens, with no special talent, who had put on bright clothes and gone out because, quite frankly, in the middle of war, how much worse could the festival possibly be? True, there were not nearly the numbers of people that we had become accustomed to seeing at the festival—there had not been the great influx of visitors from other cities, for example—but, still, Sybel and I agreed it was a more potent festival than that predicted by the so-called experts. (Including us, Janice, in our column in the Ambergrisian Daily Broadsheet.)  Then the merrymakers began to trail off. Soon the groups had thinned until it was only one or two people at a time, either drunk and careless, or alert and hurrying quickly to their destinations. Every once in awhile, something would explode in the background as the Kalif’s men kept at it. The bright orange flame was oddly reassuring. As was the shuddering explosion. As long as it stayed far away from us, that is. At least we knew where it was coming from. (It came from the Kalif, my dear, with all the force of his benevolent, if distant, love.)  Sybel and I sat there looking out the window like it was our last view of the world.  “Remember when we used to host parties in abandoned churches on Festival night?” Sybel said. He looked very old then, in that light, the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth undeniable.  “Yes, I remember,” I said, smiling. “That was a lot of fun. It really was.” At least, more fun than the war. I didn’t want to return to those days, either, though.  Sybel smiled back. Had we ever been close? I searched my memory as we stared at each other. No, not close, but comfortable. In the preparations for countless parties, in seeing Sybel day after day at my gallery, a fondness and affection had built up between us.  “Maybe after the war, I can…” The words felt like such a lie, I couldn’t continue. “Maybe the gallery can…”  Sybel nodded and looked away in, I believe, embarrassment. “That would be good.”  We continued to watch the city through our window: that fungi-tinged, ever-changing painting.   Finally, it began to happen, at least three hours after nightfall. A stillness crept into the city. The only people on the street were armed, and running. Once, a dozen men—part of a Hoegbotton militia, perhaps—hurried by in tight formation, a gleam from the fires coming off their weapons. Then, for awhile, nothing. The moon and the one or two remaining street lamps, spluttery, revealed an avenue on which no one moved, where the lack of breeze was so acute that crumpled newspapers on the sidewalk lay dead-still.  “It’s coming,” Sybel muttered. “I don’t know what it is, but it’ll happen soon.”  “Nonsense,” I said. “It’s just a lull.”  But a chill had crept over me, as it seemed to have crept over the city. It lodged in my throat, my belly, my legs. Somehow, I too could feel it coming, like a physical presence. As if my nerves were the nerves of the city. Something had entered Ambergris. (Creeping through your nervous system, the gray caps’ spores, creating fear and doubt, right on schedule. I’d been putting the antidote in your food for a week, but an antidote only works for so long against such wizardry.)  The street lights went out.  Even the moon seemed to gutter and wane a little. Then the lights came back on—all of them—but they were fungus green, shining a light that hardly illuminated anything. Instead, it created fog, confusion, fear.  Sybel cursed. 	 “Should we barricade the window?” I asked.  “Not yet,” Sybel said. “Not yet. This might be the extent of it, you know. This might…” Now it was his turn to trail off. We both knew this was not the end of it.  Through this new light, we began to see people again on the street below. This time, they ran for their lives. We could not help them without endangering ourselves, and so we watched, frozen, at the window, beyond even guilt. A woman with no shoes on, her long hair trailing out behind her, ran through our line of vision. Her mouth was wide, but no sound came from it. A few seconds later, some  thing  appeared at the edge of our vision, in the gutter near the sidewalk. It tried to stand upright like a person, tottered grotesquely, then dropped all pretense and loped out of sight after the woman.

      I know this blog is supposed to be about the writing life, but real life is a lot more important. Right now, genocide is occurring in the Sudan. This isn't a new thing, except it seems more systematic right now than in the past, especially in the area of Dafur. It's important that the United States and the United Nations condemn the actions of the Sudanese government as genocide, and intervene as quickly as possible.  It was outrageous that the international community never intervened in the genocide that occurred in Rwanda. It would be doubly outrageous if the international community did not act swiftly at this juncture to stop the slaughter in the Sudan. For years,&nbsp;the United States&nbsp;government&nbsp;has allowed&nbsp;an interest in Sudan's oil to drive our foreign policy, helping to sustain and escalate the misery of hundreds of thousands of people in the region. Now we have an opportunity to pursue a different policy that can save lives.  What can you do? Well, for starters,  urlLink this link to a diary of an aid worker  in the Sudan also includes links about how you can help, and I'm sure we're all imaginative enough to do some googling and find out how to do more.

So, before I forget again, check out  urlLink Vera's blog . Right now it features some interesting comments on the latest Strange Horizons editorial and the resultant furor.

      ...well, some might call them un-enhancements, but I've added more links to the side and a photo (thanks to Luis Rodrigues for helping me with the template). The photo was taken by Cheryl Morgan in Blackpool at EasterCon, and it makes me look a bit like a cruel magician. It cracks me up every time I look at it. But it's a great picture in part because it's got the alien baby in it and Cheryl framed it so well with the backdrop behind me. (Thanks for letting me use it, Cheryl.)  Soon, I'll add blog links and some other things. I may even start putting photos in posts...wouldn't *that* be revolutionary...

      As we close in on the ten-year anniversary of the publication of Brooks Hansen's amazing novel The Chess Garden--a book that should be more widely known in genre circles--I thought it might be appropriate to post an interview I did with Hansen back in 1996. If you haven't read this book, you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy. It's really about the redemptive power of fantasy and storytelling, among a lot of other things. It's still one of the best novels I've ever read.  Jeff  Brooks Hansen’s The Chess Garden (1995) is among the most memorable novels I have read in recent years. The novel tells the story of Dr. Uyterhoeven’s--his romance of his wife in the Netherlands and his years of quietly championing a homeopathic approach to medicine--interwoven with letters he writes in the twilight of his life after traveling back to South Africa during an epidemic. These letters concern his supposed adventures to the Antipodes, a fantastical land populated by living game pieces such as rooks, pawns, dominoes, etc. On one level, the letters are delightful tales for his wife to read to the children who gather in the doctor’s chess garden, but on another level they are powerful allegories about the doctor’s life, and his life’s work. Miraculously, The Chess Garden manages that most difficult of tasks: it melds mimetic and fabulist fiction while appealing simultaneously to the intellect and to the emotions. A New York Times Notable Book of the Year, The Chess Garden has received almost unanimous praise from critics. Mr. Hansen has co-written one previous, also highly recommended, novel called Boone.   What person or event has had the biggest impact on your writing so far?  Lessons stick out in my mind. I had a teacher at boarding school, a man named Harvard Knowles, with whom I had a fairly good rapport. He took me aside after class one time. We were discussing a story I'd submitted, and he told me that I certainly had a good facility with words and good ideas, but that my work was too cerebral; somehow the way he said it impressed me with the cranial essence of the word--that my writing, my stories existed almost entirely between the ears of my characters. He said I should try harder to move the characters around the room. It is probably the most significant advice I ever received, and it could well be said that my efforts from that moment forward have been directed at just that: learning to move the characters around the room. I believe that that is the real business and the real challenge of writing.   What writers have most influenced you?  I am not much of a reader and never have been. When I was younger, I enjoyed my share of Steinbeck and Salinger. I admire Borges. Joyce I consider to be a divinely gifted writer on the order of Shakespeare, and I suspect that Roald Dahl and Hans Christian Andersen may have had a greater influence upon me than I generally admit. And yet I just don't think it would be accurate to say that I had strong literary influences. I have spent far more time watching sports and listening to music than reading. My heroes and influences are Tom Waits, Mark Messier, Serge Prokofieff, Jean Sibelius, Bartok, and Shostakovich. The fact is, the writers I most admire, such as Salinger or Joyce, have tended to push me in the opposite direction, away from their style and milieu, out of respect and a recognition that they have more or less covered their territory.   When and how did you meet your Boone co-author Nick Davis, and how did the book come about?  I've known and been best friends with Nick literally my whole life. We never schooled together until college, though, at Harvard. Together, on an airplane down to Florida for our now defunct annual trip to the Mets Spring Training Camp, we hatched the idea of writing an oral biography about a fictional character. The idea stuck. The following summer (between sophomore and junior years) we conceived of Boone's life and the characters who would talk about him, and arrived at school the next fall with about forty information pamphlets--one for each character. We cast student actors in the roles. They studied their pamphlets and then, as soon as they were comfortable with their character, we would interview them. Our hope was that we could use the transcripts of these interviews to create the book. That didn't quite pan out--the quality of the performances was too varied--but by the time we'd conceded that, we'd been sitting with the idea and with the characters long enough that we felt ready to take on the job ourselves, basically writing the book fresh, while keeping in mind the characters and voices that some of the better actors had provided. Obviously, maintaining the distinctiveness of all the voices was an important part of the process. We did this basically by reading the book back and forth to each other, day in day out. It was always an oral process, if you will, over the course of which we learned, by drilling ourselves, to write for each character. Nick was better attuned to some; I, others--but we never split up the parts. Basically, we sat side by side, combing through the manuscript again and again and again. We did this for about three straight years without killing each other, which I think is probably the great achievement of Boone.    Not only does Dr. Uyterhoeven have a bit part in Boone, but at one point, Boone writes a story, “The Lovely Prawn,” that could have come right out of The Chess Garden. Did The Chess Garden exist in some form prior to Boone or did Boone inspire you to write The Chess Garden?  Boone inspired it. Nick and I were about 9/l0ths of the way done. We had Boone writing a children's book, but we'd given the reader no indication of what this book was about. Finally that struck us as unacceptable and we set ourselves to figuring out what that book might be. I passed by a chess shop of twenty-third street one afternoon, and in the course of the two and a half blocks between that shop and my apartment, I conceived the premise that appears in Boone. We collaborated on the story somewhat, but I think that I at least, discovered something about myself, or my creativity, in the course of doing so--something that writing Boone made clear in general--that I like narrative, I like story, I liked moving the characters around the room. Boone had frustrated this impulse somewhat, because it was so oral. No one could speak with authority. No one could tell the story. In "The Lovely Pawn" I was able to, and I saw in the premise behind it the opportunity for cultivating my narrative instincts even further.   How did the finished version of The Chess Garden differ from your conception of it when you started?  Not much at all. I tend to get my ideas all at once. Writing them down is more of a secretarial chore--getting them right, not screwing them up. I have the proposal I submitted to my then editor at Summit Books, who first acquired the novel. It still stands as a good description of the finished book, even the letters, most of which were conceived up front. I understand that mine is an approach which is anathema to most writers, who claim that a large part of the process is about letting story and the characters change and grow. My feeling has always been that that may be fun for the writer; it is not fun for the reader. If you want to make people laugh, you've got to tell the joke right. Likewise, if you want to move them, affect them, you've got to tell the story right, and that means knowing it and working it and testing it and fiddling with it. Ask any comedian. I enjoy sticking to the plan, trusting in my original inspiration.   What is your link to homeopathic medicine, and how did you become interested in the idea of the conflict between traditional/nontraditional science?  The source for most of the ideas in The Chess Garden is Swedenborg. That is, the primary purpose of the book was to convey the vision of Gustav Uyterhoeven. At the time that I was realizing that vision/understanding in my own head, I came upon Swedenborg's writings, and understood that Uyterhoeven's faith should be Swedenborgian. It is through Swedenborg's writings, or more particularly the work of others who were influenced by Swedenborg, that I made the homeopathic connection. (I would refer you to a large volume entitled Emanual Swedenborg, a continuing vision, edited by Robin Larsen, in which there is a whole section, four essays long on the connection between Swedenborgian ideas and homeopathy). As for the more general conflict between traditional and nontraditional science, I identified Uyterhoeven as a vitalist fairly early on--one who eventually came to embrace Swedenborg's vision would have to be--and was able to trace the development of his ideas accordingly, from vitalism, to empiricism, to homeopathy, to Swedenborgianism; posing him most steps of the way against his good friend Rudolf Virchow--a determinist, rationalist, allopathic and so forth. There is a book called Divided Legacy, the origins of modern western medicine, by Harris L. Coulter which was of great use to me along these lines.   Did you write the novel from beginning to end, or did you write the story of Dr. Uyterhoeven’s life separate from the stories of Antipodes and then combine the narratives. Which strand was harder to write?  Again, because I like to see my books in their entirety from the start, I don't really write from beginning to end. My technique is more like that of a painter, who begins from a sketch, and continues layering on and layering on until the original vision has been realized. A family friend and artist used to say, "If you want to draw a tree, you don't start with the top leaf." Unassailably true. Likewise, I don't start a book from the first word, or the first chapter. I sketch the whole thing out and go from there, skipping from place to place according to my current interest, to whichever part I have the energy for. I should say that I did spend a good chunk of time working on the letters only (maybe a year), followed by another good chunk where I worked on the biography, then went about putting the two together, but again, I did not experience those chunks as periods of discovery, but rather as a wrestling down of ideas and images and stories that I already knew, but which still needed rendering. As for which was harder to write. Hm. I really can't say. I think when you get down to it, narrative is narrative. The greatest imperative and the challenge is always to keep moving forward, whether you're writing about candletrees or dice chasms or the foibles of rationalist thought. Each part presented its own particular challenge. In the biographical chapters, the greatest challenge was one of distillation--how to render, with authority and authenticity, some fairly complex ideas and legacies, how to do them justice without pulling the narrative to a screeching halt. In the case of the letters, they all posed very different problems, but I suppose the denominating feature was making sure that the reader could see what was happening as clearly as possible. For the biographical portions, then, how to understand; for the letters, how to see.   At one point in The Chess Garden, you give the reader a brief glimpse of Dr. Uyterhoeven in South Africa as he’s preparing a letter to send home. Why did you decide to include this scene of the doctor’s “reality” in the midst of the “fantasy” of the letters about the Antipodes?  It is true, I have, in the Antipodes, created a fantastic landscape which may call to mind the landscapes created by Tolkein, Lewis, or Baum. Unlike those authors, however, I have also...gone to great pains to subsume that landscape in a firm historical setting. Strictly speaking, The Chess Garden is not fantasy/science fiction. Nothing truly magical or mysterious takes place. It is a story about a man who wrote a set of letters which describe a fantastic place, and it is my feeling that whatever power the book possesses, it derives from that fact--the fact that the letters, the landscape, are a gesture, the last gesture of a man who, over the course of the novel, we have come to know and understand. My fear with straight fantasy/science fiction, and perhaps the reason why I've never taken to it myself, is that even as much as I may respect the imagination it requires, the craft, the intelligence, and the vision, I am bothered by a certain limitation, a limitation upon my sympathy: that I can care only so much about a character who lives in a landscape where radically different conditions prevail--for that reason. If the conditions are so radically different, so might be the stakes, so might be the solution. Alternate landscapes offer much in the way of political statement, or religious statement, but they cannot, for me at least, inspire any great compassion or feeling. And that is why it was so important to me, in The Chess Garden, to make clear to the readers that everything they are reading is ultimately grounded in reality, that the fantasy is only an aspect of the protagonist's personality. Hence the scene of Uyterhoeven in South Africa. I wanted the readers to know the truth, so they could understand the nature of his gesture. The question for me as I was writing, was not, therefore, should I include the scene in South Africa? The question was, should I not include more? Should we not return there and see him one more time?   As we’ve discussed, Boone and The Chess Garden intersect. Should readers expect  intersections between The Chess Garden and future novels, and could you discuss what you are currently working on?  I've just finished writing and illustrating a Young Adult novel entitled Caesar's Antlers, due out next fall from FS&G. It's about a family of sparrows who take nest in the antlers of a reindeer to search the Norwegian forest for their missing father, an idea I hatched on behalf of Uyterhoeven and his son. In many a late draft, this premise was mentioned as one on which Dr. Uyterhoeven and Larkin worked together. I believe that I have cut any such mention. I'm hoping my next adult book comes out in the fall of 1998. It's called Perlman's Ordeal, and details the seven-day spiritual and professional trial of August Perlman, an atheistic, secular humanistic, music-loving, somewhat anti-Semitic, Viennese Jew who runs the clinic for suggestive (hypno)therapy in 1906 London. His life and beliefs are turned upside down by the confluence of two women upon his previously contented existence--one is an adolescent hysteric who comes to the clinic in a catatonic state and awakes with a personality not her own; the other is the older sister of one of Perlman's favorite composers, the late (but not entirely absent) Alexander Barrett. As far as I can tell, there's nothing in either Boone or The Chess Garden which anticipates it--explicitly, at least.

      Back in 1998 or 1999--I've wiped the exact dates from my memory--I, along with two colleagues, was sent on a road trip across the state by my current employer. Our task? To document existing business rules/models at the county level for a state agency.   This road trip took place over 18 weeks--every other week we would fly, or more usually, drive, to another location in Florida, some of them more cosmopolitan than others. Driving was interesting. Once, we got into an accident. A few other times, my colleague the driver would see a desired location, like a Chinese restaurant, and decide, although three lanes over and only 15 feet from the entrance to the place, in heavy traffic, to just barrel over two lanes of screeching, honking traffic to get to said restaurant. I thought we were all going to die. Another hilarious episode resulted when our colleague's faulty instructions to a watch repair store (his watch batteries had expired) led us right into the middle of a derelict crack house neighborhood with dozens of white/black/hispanic men sitting on their porches in the middle of the day watching us drive by kind of suspiciously...There was also the care-free episode in Chili's when I found vast quantities of what appeared to be tinsel in my grilled chicken and one of my colleagues found what at first appeared to be a shredded condom in his Caesar salad, but was later identified (thank goodness) as something at least a little more sanitary, made of plastic. Then, to return to our plastics theme, on the way to the airport, a plastic bag got caught in one of the wheels and I suddenly saw smoke rising--had no idea it was just a plastic bag burning from the friction--and thought the $*%&$#&!! car was on fire...  Throw in a hotel from hell in Sebring, Florida (thousands of mosquitos *inside*; moist, sweating, ectoplasmic walls; corridors on the second floor built with such low ceilings I had to stoop--what? they only cater to $%&#*!! midgets?), the car accident we witnessed in St. Petersburg during which the one guy decided to beat the living daylights out of the other guy, and the 8th trip (to where? I can't even remember at this point...) where one colleague lost the crown on one of his teeth and the other got a 103 degree fever and, yes, it was what you might expect: an absolute laugh riot.  But the piece de resistance (and I'd long since given up putting up any resistance--if we'd had a 10th meeting out of town, monkeys could have flown out of my colleague's butt during the sessions and I wouldn't have even blinked, just calmly writing down in the minutes, "Then a flock of flying monkeys entered the room by way of my colleague's ass.") occurred on our Fort Myers trip/experience.    ***    The hotel we were staying at had a computer room with a printer so rather than lug our printer down with us, I was going to use the hotel facilities. I went down there with my disk and the glass door to the room was shut and some huge, 450 lb (I kid you not) 6 foot 5 guy with a shaved head and an earring was using it. All he needed was a bandana, a parrot, and a pegleg to be a pirate (or to be a great big pile of pudding with a bandana, parrot, and pegleg on top of it).  So he comes out and as he passes me in the doorway I see he has shut down the computer and I'm going to have to reboot--which is not good. I've got a deadline. I don't have the time.  So I just kind of under my breath, looking at the screen, said, "No!"  The guy immediately turns around and says to me, "Are you cursing me? Are you cursing  me ?" His face is all red and his eyes are wild. I have no idea what he's talking about, but about the time I say "What are you talking about?" he has begun a little dialogue  with himself  that goes a little like this:  He1: You shouldn't take this kind of bullshit.  He2: I know--you don't have to take this.  He3: Yeah--who does he think he is.  He4: Show him what you can do, Stan.  Which is scarier than his anger, frankly. So I tell him of course I wasn't cursing him--that I just said "no" to the computer. He says a few more things to me and to himself and stalks off.  I sit down, a little out of sorts, and turn on the computer again and start figuring out how to print on their crappy equipment...when he comes back in again!!!!!!! This time the conversation goes something like this:  He (to himself): Show him what you can do, Stan.  Me: ????  He: I can show you your blood on the floor, you punk.  Me: Why? Why do you want to show me my blood on the floor? (a little panicked)  He: You want a piece of me? Because we can go right now. Right now. I'd like nothing better than to see your blood on the floor.  Me: I don't understand what you're talking about.  He (to himself): He thinks you're stupid. He thinks you're a freak.  Me: Are you okay?  He: So come on--are we going to go? Are we going to go...   ...and then he totally freaks me out by saying this:  "FROGGY--ARE WE GOING TO GO? FROGGY--I WANT YOUR BLOOD".  Now I'm sensing something seriously weird--I mean, how the hell does he get the frog connection? How does he know I collect and write about frogs? He doesn't know me from Adam.  So I'm severely rattled now and I'm looking around for something to hit him with because he's balling up his fists. There's nothing but the printer, so I kind of put my hands on it, I guess thinking I'd rip it off the desk and throw it at him. He, predictably, says again, "I'll see your blood on the floor."  Meanwhile, I'm wondering if printing out the meeting minutes is really worth my life. So I say:  Me: Should we call in security and ask them what they think of this idea?  He: Are you the manager?  Me: No. I'm not the manager. I just think we should go out into the lobby and ask security what they think of your idea.  He: Do you own the hotel?  Me: NO! I don't own the hotel. But let's go out in the lobby and ask them about this. Get it sorted out.  He (to himself): He's just making fun of you. He's going to get you.  Me: I'm going to get up now and we can go out in the lobby.  He: I'm still going to see your blood on the floor.  And then he leaves. One of my colleagues comes down to help out and wonders why I've locked the computer room door. I quickly let her in and lock the door, still trying to print the minutes for the next meeting. I tell her the story and she doesn't believe me! She thinks I'm making it up! (Imagine that.) So, then the guy comes back  again , but can't get in because the door is locked...so at least I'm believed now...but we see the guy talking to the hotel clerk in the lobby. Then he leaves.  Then the hotel clerk comes in and says that the guy told her that I kicked him out of the computer room and told him I was the manager and I would call security on him...We explained our side of the story--"He's crazy..."--and that was the end of it. We never saw him again...  Needless to say, we all went out that night and had a few stiff drinks...

      In compiling my nonfiction collection (Why Should I Cut Your Throat?) for Monkey Brain Books, a fair amount of material has had to be left out--for reasons of space, but also just because some stuff doesn't fit. I'm going to post some of it here from time to time over the next few months, if it still seems relevant. For example, this review of a Carter collection couldn't be included because there's a long, 10K-word essay on Carter in Why Should I Cut Your Throat? already.  Jeff  AMERICAN GHOSTS & OLD WORLD WONDERS by Angela Carter  With this posthumous collection Angela Carter - that bawdy, irreverent witch of fantastic (and fantastical) literature - gives up the ghost, relinquishes her mastery, and, still balling the muse, allows us to observe, as if in the harsh, glacial light of the morning after the carnival has left town, the bare but incredibly beautiful bones of her work.  For bones there are aplenty in American Ghosts & Old World Wonders - and tricks, too, even with the carnival loaded up, pulled out, left for another town.  In previous collections - Fireworks, The Bloody Chamber, Saints and Strangers (Black Venus in the U.K.) - Carter delighted in revealing the gears, wheels, cogs, and wires behind her illusions and in American Ghosts this does not change, except that here some of the illusions are incomplete, the tricks revealed while in progress.  To Carter's credit, the collection rises above the flotsam and jetsam of minor stories and fragments; even the worst stories show flashes of brilliance.  Most of the nine stories in American Ghosts mirror or expand on Carter's interest in her penultimate collection Saints and Strangers, in which she plotted the loci at which Old and New Worlds intersect by cataloguing the secret motivations of such historical characters as Edgar Allen Poe, Baudelaire, and Lizzie Borden.  Whereas Saints began with the taut psychodrama "The Fall River Axe Murders," a clinical examination of the twenty-four hours before Borden killed her parents, American Ghosts begins with a story of Borden's childhood entitled "Lizzie's Tiger."  The story hinges on Lizzie's adventures after wandering off during a circus performance; eventually, she meets a dirty old man who makes her touch his privates.  Unfortunately, despite dazzling language and insightful character studies, "Lizzie's Tiger" has neither the precision nor the narrative pull of the earlier "Fall River Axe Murders."  Most damaging, the story's denouement has no sense of closure; the reader, like Lizzie, waits for something more to happen and it never does.  Carter planned to write a novel about Borden and perhaps, as Susannah Clapp suggests in her introduction, "Taken together [the two stories] show what a fine, fierce book we might have had."  If "Lizzie's Tiger" reads like a character sketch, "John Ford's `Tis Pity She's A Whore" reveals Carter at the top of her form.  Carter imagines an incestuous western love affair between Johnny (Giovanni) and Annie-Belle (Annabella) as if written by John Ford the English dramatist of the Jacobean period and filmed by John Ford the American director.  Beneath the tragic surface lies undeniable wit, the story occupying territory somewhere between Shakespeare and Cormac McCarthy.  Carter adds her own touches by commenting directly to the reader, a technique coupled with startling but effective juxtapositions of dialogue:  	 ANNIE-BELLE: I count myself fortunate to have found forgiveness. 	JOHNNY: What are you going to tell Daddy? 	ANNIE-BELLE: I'm going out west. 	GIOVANNI: What, chang'd so soon! hath your new sprightly lord 		Found out a trick in night-games more than we 		Could have known in our simplicity? Ha! is't so?    Self-conscious devices have always been Carter's forte and in "John Ford's `Tis Pity She's A Whore" these devices enhance the tragic implications while, on another level, lending the story a mischievously operatic feel.  Between "John Ford's..." and the wonderful "Alice in Prague, or The Curious Room" the reader will find several colorful shards and baubles of stories and ideas that magpies like myself will carry away with delight but which anyone besides a Carter completist will, at best, consider once-used costume jewelry.  The lone exception, "The Merchant of Shadows," serves as a fun footnote to her 1977 novel The Passion of New Eve.  The story's exploration of Hollywood and film roles is marred mostly by its traditional structure.  Also worth noting is "Ashputtle or The Mother's Ghost" which, with its alternate versions of the Cinderella fairy tale, reads like an addendum to The Bloody Chamber.  Neither tale breaks any new ground for Carter, unlike the best story in American Ghosts, "Alice in Prague, or The Curious Room." What is the curious room?    There is a theory, one I find persuasive, that the quest for knowledge is, at bottom, the search for the answer to the question: "Where was I before I was born?"  In the beginning was . . . what?  Perhaps, in the beginning there was a curious room, a room like this one, crammed with wonders; and now the room and all it contains are forbidden you, although it was made just for you, had been prepared for you since time began, and you will spend all your life trying to remember it.   What can I say about this story except that it defiantly breaks every rule of the conventional short story - zero dialogue; didactic lecturing; no plot - and yet, such a beautiful and self-contained fiction about the crosshatching, the conflict, between science/logic and non-sense, Carter defining the word much as Lewis Carroll might have: ". . . the world of non-sense . . . is constructed by logical deduction and is created by language, although language shivers into abstractions within it."  To summarize the story is to tell it over again; suffice it to report that Alice, Tycho Brahe, and Carmen Miranda make important cameos in one guise or another.  The fructi-fornicating Archduke Randolph with his lively edible loves is a particular treat for those readers who possess both high and low senses of humor.  How can Carter juggle so many apposites?  Answer: easily.  Perhaps American Ghosts & Old World Wonders should share the title of her first collection, Fireworks.  For, like that first collection, this last collection flares and fizzles and, every so often, explodes into such a profusion of light and magic that the images are still imprinted on your retinas the day after, even in the glare of morning, the carnival gone and never to return.  At the end, Carter has come back to the beginning precisely because then, as now, she could never resist going farther than she should, certain that if her reach should exceed her grasp the only thing for it was to reach even farther.

      According to Poppy Z. Brite, the horror community sucks. And she names me as part of the problem in her  urlLink latest blog entry  (August 6th). She says I took potshots at her out of envy at her publishing deals. She then goes on to imply that I think she and Kathe Koja are castrating bitches.  There's only one problem here. I think Kathe Koja is a great stylist and a wonderful writer, and I actually published one of her first, early stories in my magazine Jabberwocky back in the late 1980s. I also tried to solicit work from Brite and Koja for the Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric & Discredited Diseases. I also tried to solicit work from Koja for Leviathan.  (It's probably irrelevant or anecdotal at best to note that my wife Ann deleted a negative reference to her in a book column in Ann's magazine The Silver Web because she thought it was unfair to Poppy. I totally agreed with that decision.)  For the record, let me state that I have read exactly three pieces by Poppy Z. Brite. One of them was her first novel, which I thought was mediocre. The second of them was a story about India that I didn't think was accurate in its descriptions. The third was an excellent absinthe-drenched pseudo-Decadence story (which is what prompted me to solicit work from her for the fake disease guide). End of story. I can't remember reviewing either the novel or the India story. And I can't remember commenting on them in public. If I did comment somewhere, it would have had to have been literally over a decade ago. And it certainly wouldn't have been out of spite.  I am still planning on picking up Brite's latest novel, which looks very interesting. The farther she's gone from the horror field, ironically enough, the more interesting her work has seemed to me.  In short, I think Poppy's thinking of someone else or has been fed some wrong info or is blowing up some slight I can't even remember and then magnifying it to the point of potential libel.  Yes, welcome to the horror community--it really does suck. And if you want to learn to what extend, you'll just have to read my nonfiction collection Why Should I Cut Your Throat? There's an essay on horror in there--that doesn't even mention Poppy Z. Brite--that'll curl your toenails.  JeffV
