      Greetings from the Sunny side of the globe...  Just a quick note to say wot a laugh it is to read the range of poems about my little bro. I never really thought of him as a muse...  Did not know he could be a source of such humour.  Cheers Nick  PS Appologies for butting in on your blogging...

      Adam, I fully understand your insecure need to label me a Meatloaf fan, and I appreciate your childish jibes and playful banter. You have put a smile on my weary face. Its trully refreshing to know that some sections of the Conservative party still have a sense of humour. It gives me hope for the future when a leading Tory such as yourself is able to put aside his narrow-minded attiudes, his inherent Machavelian outlook, his prudish and self obsessed view of life and his complete lack of tolerance and understanding for anyone who isn't born into wealth and privlege. And here was me thinking you were just another Ian Duncan Smith but with more hair.  I also giggle when I think of the immense irony in you lambasting my falsified love of Meatloaf when you spend the majority of you leisue time listening to the mindless, throwaway drone that is the music of BoneyM.

      The first batch of ‘Adam’s Brown Ooze’ will be ready in time for Peter’s Party. I have taken half a block of 100% pure co-co and bottled it with a litre of Vodka. The resulting sludge is an incredibly strong chocolate tasting spirit that should warm the cockles of even the hardest cider drinker. After two days the taste is gert lush, so after two weeks it should be mighty-fine.

      Fellow bloggers, please do not be misguided by the rantings of our Northern neighbour. His grubby Scottish digits, soiled by the discharge of love for Marvin Lee Aday, mash the keyboard in an incensed and sticky denial of childhood passion for the seventies, eighties and, sadly, the nineties as well, rock music legend. Unfortunately, in a cruel twist of fate, this denial has left him unable to say the things he wants to say . It’s like you’ve taken the words right out of his mouth, which must have been whilst you were kissing him. Run Eddie RUN!

      I concur with Wendy. This debate is irrelevent to myself, seeing as I am a confirmed chocoholic of the worst kind, and would eat all the Rolos in one sitting anyhow. Me giving away the last one? Dream on!  And now, one hopes, for a week without booze...at least a weekend without booze...or maybe even a night? Anyone for a yummie fruit smoothie? I need non-alcoholic (and cheap) ideas for this weekend, seeing as Pete's leaving do may possibly involve the destruction of many souls, morals, livers, and reputations (or it may add to them...who knows?).  One thought I've had is a bit of Laserquest...Joe obviously needs to work on his anger management - perhaps if all the other team wore Meatloaf masks?  Remember children, 'Feel the Loathe'.

      Sometimes you give out the last rolo simply because you ate too many already and the thought of another one fills your head with visions of porcelain gods and the like.  :)  I am the last of the great romantics.

      In your desperate search for a cheap insult you seem to have entriely missed the point of my previous message. I will extrapolate no more as I feel that this very worthy debate has been completely trivialised by your written wanderings. You are quite aware of the passion that any reference to myself and any kind of affection for the music of Meatloaf can arouse. His music, his words, his very existence sickens me. I was brought up in the Catholic church, I was a good Christian, a firm believer until the moment I heard 'Bat out of Hell'. From that point on faith was an impossibility as I ceased to recognise that human creation was a good thing. I am now very angry, I need to calm down, I want to beat all my work colleagues to death with my water-bottle..... you Bastard.

      Your tongue is sharp and your keyboard worn with the pounding of many a misguided word young Joe. In this day and age tis sad to think that one cannot find romance in anything non-materialistic. With passion burning in your throbbing heart for that someone special the 9:15 Paddington to Bristol can seem like the Orient Express, the mud flats of Weston-Super-Mare can seem like a sun-drenched shores of the Maldives and a wilting handful of daisies transform into a dozen red roses when gazed upon through the warm splendour of love. Joe, I leave you with this thought, once said by your hero “I would do anything for love, but I won’t do that!”

      Regardless of any fictional nonsense such as love, endearment or affection, 'the last rolo'  refers directly to the final rolo extracted from the packaging. In 77% of all last rolo hand-overs(Gallup, 2002) the recipient was within viewing range of the package, thus   were able to correctly identify if the rolo was indeed the last one. This being the case, would the intended romantic gesture still be as effective if you simply stated to your desired reciever that despite the rolo clearly being from the middle of the packet you wanted it to represent 'the last one' and in turn represent your affection for her/him? Would you buy your Partner a plastic engagement ring and tell her that you wanted her to believe it was made of diamond? Would you buy your girlfriend a 'romantic holiday' to Blackpool and tell her as she was walking along the illuminated front in the pissing rain to imagine and pretend that she was indeed relaxing in a Gondola as she pleasently cruised the canals of Venice while sipping on some cool Champagne. No, you fucking wouldn't!  In circumstances where the reciever is oblivious to whether your rolo is the last one. To lie to her/him that it was would represent an underlying dishonesty and betrayal that would in the future manifest itself in a more serious form ie. adultery, beastiality or GBH.

      Bugger. Matt loses phone - twice! At least I got it back, though...  Nought untoward, as far as I recall, Bev, but seeing as I can't remember much about last night I wouldn't take my word for it! Bloody port shots & all sorts...  And now, another poem...  There was a young lad called Ged, Who was rumoured to be quite good in bed. We needed to pry, So we sent out a spy, It's just irritating that Bev's never said!  I t'ank you!

      I am assuming the below post was not directed towards me. However, a couple of points.   Firstly,   discus  n. pl. dis·cus·es  Sports.  A disk, typically wooden or plastic with a metal rim, that is thrown for distance in athletic competitions.  A track-and-field event in which a discus is thrown.  A small, brilliantly colored South American freshwater fish (Symphysodon discus) that has a disk-shaped body and is popular in home aquariums.  Something resembling a flat circular plate; a disk.  Botany. See disk.     Further literary (and other) criticism of Adam's thesis to follow...

      Adam, personally i believe Rolos are Satan's clagnuts.  They are cheap and probably made of lard.  I would take it as a blatant insult to be offered a 'Warehouse' price item of confectionery, preferring luxury sweets made by the house of Rocher.  Or you could just give me the loving directly rather than fannying round trying to get my knickers off by giving me tacky chocolates.  And they say romance is dead ; )

      Rolo Debate ...   I have decided the following...  As with all gifts, it's the thought or deed that counts, not the item. Giving your last rolo is a ritual to declare your love for someone special. Love, of course, can mean many a splendour thing, be it Eros the Greek word for romantic, hormonal and sexual love or Philia meaning brotherly love like the love of a friend. It may even apply to Storge, the love of parents for a child. Agape, God's love, probably wouldn't apply as the big man (or woman) is very unlikely to single one person out to give them his (or her) last rolo. If you sent a valentines card that was 'inadvertently' opened by your rather nosy flatmate, the love contained wouldn't pass on to the bitch, it would remain always with the intended recipient. The love is the act, not the object. So in conclusion, your last rolo is whichever one you wanted it to be, for whom ever you love in any form for any reason at any time ergo, not only does your last rolo not necessarily have to be your last rolo, but it doesn't have to be a rolo at all.  Discus.

      Dear All  after watching 'crank yankers' on Wednesday night, I've been inspired to adopt one of their sayings as our offical group motto. Obviously I cannot make that judgement, so I put forward my suggestion for debate...  Suggestion No 45876g67ee549ze  "Too Many Poo's And We All Loose, Hold It In And We All Win"  Wadda ya fink?  Other suggestions could be ...  "Out with hate, in with love" "In Love with all human kind" "Always a pleasure, never a chore" "when your alone and life is making you loney, you can always go... FOODTOWN"  But I like the 'poo' one best

      Dear All,   as promised, here are the results...  Pukawa Faction – Survey Results  Personal preference: 62% preferred tea to coffee 69% preferred roast to pasta 56% preferred white to red wine 62% preferred a dog to a cat 38% preferred a forest to a beach 56% preferred a reef dive to a sky dive (does that mean more people in the group like going down?) 25% preferred a good soap to sport on the telly 62% preferred cereal to a fry-up Politically 56% lean to the left and 25% lean to the right Ice Cream fav’s… Lot’s of Chocolates, a few mint-choc-chip, a little hokey-pokie, strawberry, vanilla, cinnamon, cookies and cream and the caramel pecan one all got a mention  Honesty: 94% would hand in a wallet 50% said they would steal a drink at a pub 56% said they wouldn’t own up if they broke something at a party  Integrity: 75% said they would kick over a snowman (bastards!)  Generosity: Highest single monetary donation to charity was £200, two people said they have never given anything.  Sexual: 31% said they owned a sex toy People admitted to having sex… up a tree, on a ferry, in a hammock in the Amazon, in a moving car on the motorway, 2 people said they had sex in the middle of a field, one with an audience of 40 people, in a bush, on a snow plough, public shower cubical, in the MD’s office and in the rugby changing rooms.  Self Analysis: 62% said they were happy at work Best Body Parts… Legs, upper back, shoulders and back, soul, chin, hair [pronounced: Hur] lots of eyes, couple of legs and two people said everything Worst Body Parts… wrist, thighs, wrinkles, conscience, couple of noses, and belly, belly, belly, belly, belly and belly.  What do you do to relax: 19% Read 12% Listen to music 12% Drink or take drugs 25% do exercise of some sort 6% practice self-hypnosis 6% have a bath and 12% have a wank  Desert Island: 19% would take their mum 50% would take a mate 12% would take a brother or sister 6% would take someone famous 12% would like to be alone Items… Radio, mascara, book [2], bed, football, mobile phone, pen and paper, tweezers, tomato sauce and sex toys Music… John Mayer, Fat Boy Slim, Grove Armada, Clannad, The Smiths, Dago Reindheart, Eric Clapton, Ben Folds Five (Penfold’s High!), Tool, Limp Biscuit (I know a game… no, better not!), some tidy tracks, radio two’s greatest hits and MEAT LOAF.  Not one of you picked Boney-M which just goes to prove that you are all tea-drinking, dog-loving, belly hating, mumsie wankers who are too busy playing with your sex toys and listening to meat loaf to appreciate the finer qualities of 70’s funk.

      Topic of discussion  Last Rolo: What constitutes ‘the last rolo’?  With all due respect to the lovely Bev, I don’t believe she has the authority to close such an important topic and decide its outcome. Only I can do that!  So, here’s the poser… Is the last rolo, the last out of the packet or the last rolo consumed.  If you decide that the last rolo is the last one out of the packet, is it geographically placed? ie the end rolo on the opposite end to the end you opened, OR if someone nabs both ends, does the last rolo become one of the middle rolo’s? If you believe that the last rolo is the last rolo consumed and you drop a rolo down the drain, does your last rolo ergo your love, belong to some sewer rat?   Out with hate, in with love  Adam the Master Debater

      Well, my Saturday night revelation has opened up an entire world of new opportunities and indeed sordid invitations from a large number of you sickos out there... (Infact, due to demand, we girls have a show at the weekend, tickets priced at $100).  Annie - Kat has now joined the Wanking Posse and has offered to demo her latest technique but only if Pete can watch too.  I'll bring along my "Vibrating Panties" to add to our relaxation repertoire...  Anway Joe, I've decided the definition of The Last Rolo is definitely all to do with physical location within the packet and not the timeliness of consumption.  Vicky - I really hope your photo of my morning Lara Croft impression doesn't come out (pls keep it to yourself!)  Anyway, I'm going off to 'relax', I mean work

      Ugh. Well, my brain has just about recovered from somewhat near 48 hours of continuous alcohol abuse & hand-rolled 'cigarettes', along with that most excellently modified beer bottle.  I think I can safely say I enjoyed the weekend thoughroughly, and whilst I would like to get involved in the whole mutual admiration thing, I think we should can it before it all gets too much. Suffice to say, it was great. Everyone did their thing & played their parts magnificently, and I would hope y'all loved it.  Highlights for me....  The haka in round 1 of question time. The view when you got down to the shore of the lake. Pete accusing Joe of being a Meatloaf fan. Bev as the Mummy. My continuous flirting with Marion and anyone else within reach (but hey, what's new?).  Well, that's it. I'm off to phone the models....  Actually, that reminds me - Joe - there's looking cool, and there's not feeling the cold. After this weekend, which would you prefer????  Yours,  Matt Mattovich, King of Pratfalls

      A short Statement:  Vicki and I have been 'together' for the past little while. I really like her and I think that she really likes me. It is killing us both to keep this quiet from you guys, so I am doing the cowardly thing and announcing it right now(with Vicki's approval of course). I hope that you can forgive us for our surreptitiousness over the past week or so, I hope we haven't offended anyone. Anyway, this will in no way disrupt the delightful harmony we have established in the house. Things will be more or less the same, except Vicki and I may just spend a bit more time in each others company.   Thankyou.

      Another Short Poem:  In our house there lives a chap called Peter Some say his penis measures over a metre His Mum's a Swede and his Dad's a Brit But we just know him as a stuck up Git  He practiced law for many a year But his love was for drugs, women and beer He gave up his job and packed his bags To live in Halston Road with a bunch of Slags  A sexual dynamo, a fine looking man A musical Philistine, and a Liverpool fan A model by day, and a Gigolo by night I know what you're thinking, I'm talking shite  Peter is our friend, but he can be a brat Fuck only knows how he scored with Kat I bow to his knowledge and superior wit Although most of the time he talks alot of shit

Oh Stu, you have no equal Kings Lynn must miss your like You're fearsome on a Monday in Margheritas And a glorious transvestite.  Oh Stu, others may seek to take your place to copy your look and feel, but in my heart I know their fraud Noone can match your shiny automobile  Oh Stu, my heart's in disarray you have buried me in blue I can't believe you've left me so For a woman in comfortable shoes.

      A work in progress... (I was very bored at work today)    You know you've been in Auckland too long when...    you start thinking that ladies netball does not get the international television coverage it deserves,  you think overtaking using the central reservation, on the brow of a hill, on a corner, in rush hour is a viable driving technique,  you check to see if the car that just cut you up/nearly crashed into the back of you/is otherwise careering towards you is being driven by "an Asian".  a chill comes over you at the thought of the All Blacks not winning the Rugby World Cup (although they're clearly not up to much, but not as bad as Wales)  you decide that whatever your car, it can be improved through the liberal use of blue neon and a turbo which sounds like Ivor the Engine.  you start thinking its really cool to give all your national sports teams cutesy names based on their kit.  you know who the Silver Ferns, the All Whites, the Black Caps and the Tall Blacks are, and care.  you know the Korean/Japanese/Cantonese for "I want to use the internet".  you know when the Queen's Birthday is.  you think paying more than 650 quid for a car is massively extravagant.  you can name three or more gourmet burger outlets.  your favourite example of local Kiwi cuisine is bought from the Asian Food Court.  you refuse to pay more than $4 for fush and chups.  you start considering central heating, double glazing and insulation untenably extravagant luxuries.  you forget how you survived before you discovered The Warehouse.  you think there's no shame in losing the world's biggest boat race to a land locked nation.

I live in Auckland with four silly fools They all like to drink and shag like mules But one little fellow, Jamie is his name Is beginning to get desperate, his heart is in pain  Jamie is a stud, of that there is no doubt So why then is Jamie suffering a sexual drought Some say its his willy, they suggest its quite small But I have seen it's glory, standing proud and tall  Many a girl Jamie has had, his past is littered with shame Girls go weak and get on their knees at just a mention of his name He's known as the best, he can go for hours in every single position They can't get enough, they just want more of Jamie's sexual nutrition  We all love Jamie, he's the best, and we hope he gets a shag If it would help I would take him to bed, but Jamie isn't a fag His Irish charm and deadly wit will find him a lady, I'm sure I only hope the brothel expense doesn't leave him broke and poor...  Thankyou.

      Hmm. I suspect we're all doomed....doomed I say....  *Ahem*  Rat worshipping there may be, but certainly no hamster worshipping. That bugger is just far too strange. Anyhow, here's to a snow & fun-filled weekend somewhere in the middle of North Island!  And for all you buggers that didn't come along to Cream - it was great!! Ooo me back, me legs, and me arms....I ain't as young as I used to be, y'know....

      I don't think you've really had a big night out in Auckland until you've been refused entry to Sky City casino for being too drunk (not to mention getting aggressive with the door man). Applause to Ged and Bev for becoming the newest members of this exclusive group...

       And so to begin...   Just a gigolo, everywhere I go people know the part I'm playing. Paid for every dance, selling each romance, every night some heart betraying. There will come a day, youth will pass away, then what will they say about me? When the end comes, I know, they'll say "Just a gigolo", As life goes goes on without me.  God bless Chester the mechanical Hamster, and Candice for bringing him into our lives.

      *** Ummm, Bailey’s*** Dear All,  In preparation for the fantastic Coromandel weekend fast approaching I would like to invite you in the making, partaking and tasting of a home made Bailey’s this weekend. It has to sit for at least a week before consuming (so it won’t be stored at Halston Road) I have found a great recipe and would like to jig it slightly to add a caramel and chocolate flavour to half the batch, keeping the other half as traditional Bailey’s. Does the bottle collection at Halston include any whiskey? All in favour say ‘umm creamy’

      Been back for a grand total of 48 hours and am now off to beeuutttiful Sweden, so communications may be a little intermittent for the next couple of weeks. Lovely and warm here at the moment, sunshine streaming in through the window, birds singing in the trees, and the joy of wearing all those clothes I left behind and haven't worn in 2 years. Anyway, this all pales into insignificance compared to the anguish I feel having left you behind, I'm just using it to fill the void, sniff, sniff, oh God, I can't take it any more.....oh errr, yeh anyway.  , see you later.

      Hello troops...  well in these dark post-Pete days i am in desperate need of distraction.  Al has come up with the fiendishly good idea of going to view Mars at the Auckland Observatory this weekend, assuming it doesn't piss it down that is.  Once in a lifetime opportunity unless they discover the elixir of youth and we all live to reach the ripe old age of 60,493.  Is 12 bucks and you can find out more about it at www.stardome.org.nz.  Let me or Al-ee-star know and we'll make a booking (or we can do it next week if you're all planning to be in a narcotics induced haze this Saturday).    katfish xxxxxx

      Ugh. Lots of sleep over weekend, feel marginally better.  Pete, you smug man, I reel in jealousy over your upgrade. All I have is an aisle seat and a very, very long flight home on the 5th/6th.   Anyone wanna buy a mattress/car/mobile phone? In NZ, that is...Pete, any offers greatfully received, so long as you're prepared to pay shipping costs!  Yours in tiredness,  Matt

      Sitting in a starbuckseque joint overlooking the stretch of water between Hong Kong island and the other main bit of Hong Kong called Kowloon. Can sit here a while for the price of a Snapple (something I have missed in NZ). Have spent entire day walking around in heat and humidity, but have achieved my gadget fix...  Getting upgraded on the plane was definitely the business. Whichever spurious lie Vicky wrote on my reservation, make sure she writes it on yours too....champagne Mr Baldwin....?

      Hey all,  Disco Stu here, Just a quick note to say that I had a great time on Sat,  Quite a fitting send off for our beloved Pete, and a good piss up all in all. I thank you all for the lovely compliments I recieved, and I also thank all the ladies for looking sooo fine, I'm sure you have added a couple of years to my life - with the great mental images I now hold so dear.  Talking of images, what is the web addy of the pic site, and when will some pics be up?   I have just found out that my father's Orange Paisley suit is still in existance and I may be able to get my hands on it.  Now that will be class.  To all of those who don't have my email addy, it follows - just in case you to send me some love personelly. an_lkey@hotmail.com    Keep in touch all, and I look forward to seeing the photo's.  Pete, is there any chance of us getting a copy of the video on obsolete technology?? So when you have gone NZ still has a version of the night.  Later Mike

      Oh God. Not more drinks. Sobriety is but a distant memory....anybody for sleep? No? Thought not.  On the subject of going out & getting plastered (which I know is going to hold your attention), who's up for moving on to somewhere like the Fu bar afterwards? Or even midway through? Us dodgy old ravers are feeling distinctly left out & are losing touch with our roots!  In the meanwhile, I'd just like to comment on how grim it is to know that someone on this PC, in this Internet cafe, has been surfing porn. I feel like I should be wearing gloves to avoid contamination. Every time I type anything in the scrollbar all sorts of 'orrible things are appearing - and someones' put links to 'XXX Porn' on the Desktop...eeewwww....  Well, must dash...I must go & figure out exactly what monies I have access to over the weekend....  And as for Nick...he too is a muse! But at this moment I am stuck to think of anything other than 'Dick' to rhyme with his name, so I shall sign off - if you carn't say anything nice, then don't say nuttin', as various people have said on various occasions...

      Hi all,  F**k what a weekend!!! I had a blinder, with fun being my middle name and social lubricator my weekend occupation, I lived up to all expectations and more.  Friday night we all went to God's Kitchen and partied well into the wee hours, I was my usual lovely self and had an absolute blast.  The only downer of the night was my useless Telecom phone, was down ALL night, So I couldn't send any love to the world (I think they deserve a letter), and really felt the urge to do so. Other than that slight blemish we had a lot of fun, the music was good, a little slow at times, but if you wanted it faster you could always go into the Hard House room (so no complaints).  So we pulled the pin about 5.30 and were all tucked up in bed about 6am.  The morning was pretty quiet until, I had to find the energy and go to my sisters B'day party in Ham's.  A couple of Red Bulls for the drive and I made it there safe and sound, just in time to have a quick spa bath and get dressed to go to the party.  The party was good, we held the pool table most of the night, and as I still had a little friend in my pocket I took a 1/2 and spent a bit of time feelin the love with the ol' family, until I thought it was time to PARTY.  So I said my goodbye's and went to a dance club and charged until it shut at 3am. (and once again my stupid Telecom phone would not work - so once again NO LOVE could be sent - Grrr) As I left I met up with one of my old school mates who invited me back to his place for a spa, which was soooo relaxin I almost fell asleep.  Then I crashed out for about 5 hours.    Sunday was spent visiting and inviting ppl to the party on Sat, watched the Warriors (who were extremely flat) had a great feed, got a solid 10 hours sleep and drove back to Auckland this morning.  So as I said it was pretty full on, had heaps of fun, caught up with heaps of mates, got mangled and partied. Am now lookin forward to another great party this weekend.  Lots of love to you all, as I could not send it on Fri or Sat nights.  Later Mike

      Dear All,  I have now been formally presented with the Book of Hot Auckland Lurve, which frankly is quite spectacular. I feel tremendously honoured to have such a great bunch of friends, not to mention a spectacular girlfriend who put this together. I shall hug you all individually when I see you soon.  On a separate note, went out with Fish last night and met up with Ross and Amanda and got very drunk, and spent a spectacular amount of money in a swanky London bar.  Hugs and smooches and stuff like that.  Pete  "Share the love". "Always a pleasure never a chore" "Out with hate in with love" "A fish in the bush is worth two in a parked car".

      Hi all,  I am bored at work and have run out of ppl to annoy here, so it will be you for the moment.  We are gearing up for another great weekend, Dance Party on Fri (God's Kitchen) with some quality Dooff Dooff music. (Trance and Hard House - Super sweet) And as we have a good crew going it should be a great night.  I dunno what everyone else is doing on Sat night as I have to go to Ham's for my sister's 30th B'day (I think I will need some help to make it through the night, after what will be a very long Friday night). So you will all have to try and survive without me - I know it will be hard but I'm sure you will survive, you will have to hold back all your love and praise until next weekend.  We are also starting to finalize the preparation for the combined B'day party at the mighty Whitford Residence on the 4th.  It will once again be a great night with more quality Dooff Dooff music, and many ppl will be partying with me until the wee hours in a slightly altered state of mind. We will be supplying music, beer and as always great company.  If you are lucky we might even put on some food, but we'll see how we go.  Everyone is invited even those in other parts of the world.  You know we are worth it and all.  And as a matter of interest to those who care, I have almost finished 'The Book' well all the important chapters anyway.  So yes 'Dr love' will soon grace these pages with a few tips for you all.    Well got to go - duty calls  Mike

'Boro Sue survived Reading - somehow - and left this afternoon vowing to see everyone as soon as conveniently possible. This was after interrogating my Dad to see if there was any oil & gas in her back yard...it's a long story.  Not much else to say at this point. Life continues...

Halston Posse - thank you all so much for the flowers, love and cyber hugs, mum and i are very grateful.  The wonderful Mr Baldwin has been taking very good care of me and survived a Friday night in our local with no less than three of my ex-boyfriends with his dignity and humour intact!    Annie - loved the golfball msg - all of you phone everyone you care about in the world and share the love - this is an order...   still no idea when i'll return or when funeral will be but nae fear, i'll be back....  love katfish xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Things are ok up here in (no longer sunny at all) Bangor, and we are going out on the piss tonight for the first time in a while. I am heading north for wedding partay tomorrow and Fish is then coming down to London on Monday to be introduced to the greater Baldwin clan and the swedish ambassador and ferrero rocher. Thank you for all being wonderful, and we both miss you terribly, but shall hopefully return to you all not too distantly.  Mucho hugs.  Pete

Dissaffected already, v.distressing, but was out last night taking in the sights - y'know, 2 gangs of blokes beating the shit out of each other, police all over the shop, and just general grimness. Not the best, don'tchaknow...  Still, gorgeous weather, considering going out for a spot of sunbathing. In the meanwhile it appears I shall be instaled fairly smartly in a job - what it may be, I have no idea, but I have various recruitment agents chasing me for my CV and interviews...which is nice!  Tally ho, chocks away, and beware those bandits at 4 o'clock - they're just determined to ruin afternoon tea...

      Hmm...I'll go with 11.  Remember, greed is good.  I'm now worried - this 'apple juice' of my uncle's is a bit potent - I think you'd like it, Adam - well nice.  Not much else to say, 'cept I should have a mobile phone this weekend & will pass on the number accordingly to Ms. Fish & associated others.

      I am very busy at work thank you, I have to monitor blog, email, find recipes for goulash etc. Starting reading book, bit strange at first, but now I'm getting used to the characters it starting to really appeal.  Pete & Matt, I'm going to put a chip on a four way bet on the roulette table inspired by each of you, choose a number [we are going Saturday, so you better let me know by then] and the first spin will be using your numbers. If it wins I’ll put it towards a round of drinks for those that come along.  Adam

      *** Money Money Money *** Say good bye to your hard-earned cash, cause this weekends suggested event is a trip to the Casino [with a trip to the top of the Sky-Tower by night]. The afternoon is planned like this. 12pm Start getting ready 1:30pm still sat chatting, not started yet, must start now 2pm really must start getting ready 2:13pm shout abuse at whoever is in the bathroom 2:15pm pace up and down kitchen 2:18pm shout more abuse at bathroom 2:36pm 'queue jumping' curse and threaten horrible things to flat mate as he/she slips into bathroom  3:10pm finished getting ready, head count, one missing, where's Jo? 3:20pm wait for Jo to go into bathroom 3:42pm wait for Jo to come out of bathroom 3:59pm all start to wander towards the front door 4:07pm all wander back again 4:12pm all wander to front door again, some even manage to get in a car and start it 4:17pm finally get in car and head towards Carlton Gore 4:28pm arrive at Carlton Gore 4:29pm shower Adam with praise for delicious gourmet wafts of heaven coming from kitchen 4:33pm where’s Jo? 4:38pm after much debate, realise Jo was left at service station 4:39pm Fetch Jo 4:40pm drinks finally served 4:50pm shower Adam with praise for being Adam 5:00pm Dinner is served 5:05pm, 5:06pm, 5:08pm, 5:12pm, 5:18pm Shower Adam with praise for nutritious gastronomic taste sensation, like a duff duff party on your tongue. 5:20pm Jo arrives just in time to wash up, she’s more than welcome to help herself to leftovers 5:20pm to 7:03pm Take the piss out of Jo, reminisce about other times Jo has gone missing, shower Adam with more praise, drink. 7:04pm start talking about going to the Casino 8:06pm summarise Casino options 8:26pm order taxi’s and leave 8:30 onwards – go up tower, loose money.  If you want to skip the food at Carlton Gore, fine, fuck you, I’ve never liked YOU anyway, you can go directly to the casino, and let’s hope you loose your wife AND both kids on poker.  I’m thinking about doing a traditional Czech Goulash with dumplings and bread (with Veggie-terrible option for all the pumpkin lovers). Bring along your own grog, Pils beer would be a great thing to bring along if you like it.  If too many people want to come along we will change the home cooked food option to a take-away option.  Puh-lease let me know if you are interested in the food option, so I can plan. If you can’t make it at all, don’t miss out on the ‘showering Adam with praise’ this can be done by email, phone or fax at any time, or by writing a cheque, postal order or direct debit.  Always a pleasure, and very rarely… no, never a chore

      Our Jamie has a dodgy grin, Could it be that he's living in sin? I would've thought not, Seeing as his nether regions had rot, But it would appear that he's actually scored a win!  I t'ank you!  Well folks, I'm back in the UK. Of course, my body clock is completely f*cked at the mo, but a serious session last night made sure I was awake to the early hours, and all should be well for a hefty job-searching Monday. Great.  Very touched by the send-off - was great that y'all could be there - even if Kat was more stressed about the whole thing than I was! Got many things to do here, but hopefully in the not-too-distant future I'll be hooking up with the errant Swede and ensuring his downfall. Much the same as back in NZ, just got slightly further to go to reach him.  Well, I'm off to get some sleep, and I'll speak to y'all soon.  Take care, keep smiling, huge hugs,  Matt

      Ok the plan 4 tonight,  Once we have made sure Matt has left the country, (we do love you Matt - honest) everyone is invited to come for a wee excersion to the country,  The entertainment for the evening shall be the Southpark Movie (as a disturbing amount of you have not seen it) followed by star gazing (weather permitting) with your new maps of the sky. Drinking shall take place before, during and after all such activities. Other than that the only other entertainment shall be the usual whitty banter, with the conversation probably ending up in the gutter.

      Oh well, shame you all had such a shit time, but then it was only to be expected in the circumstances. Dearest Schmanny, thank you for the phone call, twas lovely to talk to a few of you. I was a little pissed at that point, my apologies if I was incoherent. Im not even sure if it was before or after the stripper. As I write, you're probably all getting up after Matts do and feeling shit. No sympathies, drinking without me indeed...  I'm now back in London after the Swedish adventure and burning at high speed down the Autobahn (bottled it after hitting 200K) and counting down the days until Matt gets back (oh yes, and Ms Fish). Oh yeh, saw a bottle of new Vanilia Absolut the other day. Must try some...  Miss you all. Now Bugger off.  Pete

      I must concur it was a most exceptional weekend, great weather, great location, and great company (as always). The weekend had something for everyone, we drank, we smoked, we tramped, we slept on hillsides, we galivanted around the coast, we even lay beneth the stars.  The location was brilliant, we woke up on Saturday to a lovely late winter's morn, and found ourselves in a valley surrounded by rolling hills and native bush.  On both days I set off with a car load of willing participants and we drove around the coast line taking in the magnificent scenary, scouting out a location for me to retire to.  The views were spectacular, with crisp clear waters and not a ripple upon the ocean.  Every house, hut, batch or Mansion was evaluated as to it's view, location, proximity to township (including growth potential of township) and most importantly size of balcony for drinking piss on (of paramount importance when comparing properties).  Our task was so Strenuous as we stopped on a hillside to bask in the sun and absorb the view, for only a moment, we found ourselves lying fast asleep atop the hill, listening to the waves crash upon the rocks, cusioned in the long soft grass. (for those interested I will be retiring in either Little bay, Whangapoua, Matarangi or Opito Bay (the latter three not visited on our wee excursion.))   Others entertained themselves by falling off horses, testing 4x4's, smoking, tramping, drinking and of course relaxing - on this note I must admit this is the most awake I have been on a Monday in a conciderable period of time (I am unsure if this is a good thing as Mondays suck, but an experience none the less).  I'll just have to get all sorts of fucked up this weekend so my Body doesn't get withdrawls.  Well as you are all probably aware I have started rambling (one of my many traits) so I will leave you all (some to relive the lovely memories of our journey and others to ponder what they missed.)

      Well, it was indeed a great weekend. I am knackered, but thanks to the joys of not working, have had a fun time lying in - apart from Kat phoning me at 9:30am, of course. And another 3 calls for Lisa whilst she was asleep. And missing the chimney sweep whilst I was in the shower and she couldn't be arsed to get out of bed.  Well, it's all a bit manic. Plus points include no chafing or backache from horses (and falling off them), a possible sale of mobile phone, and discovery of several places to sell car. Minus points include sadness at leaving, dread at possible alcohol poisoning Wednesday & Thursday, and no luck so far in mattress selling. Oh well. Still, done good deed for day in helping some newly arrived backpackers orientate themselves. For those suspicious of my motives, they were not young, attractive females, but instead a 30something couple who I got chatting to 'cause the bloke had a London Irish rugby top on (that'll be my local rugby club back home, for the non-sporting amongst you).  For those who don't know, leaving do is Wednesday night - commences 8-8:30 at De Post, moving on at an unspecified time to the Dogs Bollix, and then around midnight going to a suficiently cheesy 80s night at St. James'. I hope this is enough variety to satisfy y'all, if not - too f*cking bad.  Dat's it, I'm off to get into salesman mode.

      *** Great Weekend *** The weatherman said strong winds, rain and even the chance of hail… We had glorious sunshine served on a cloud-dappled blue platter followed by a generous sprinkling of stars and lashings of milky-way. At one point we even seen THREE MOONS! What a great weekend, YABBY! I hope the horsey people aren’t too chaffed. I have some good news and some bad news., The bad news is, as well as over 50 digital photographs I took 4 films of photo’s, which makes for a very LONG evening. The good news is, it may take a while for me to get around to having them developed , so you have some time to escape Auckland. Thanks everybody, even Pete was there [via phone and very pissed, but he was there!] Where next…?

My cyber loafing days were curtailed slightly due to me blowing up dad's pc and the inexplicable lack of net cafes in the farming community of Llandegfan but after many hours of cursing (and a little help from the Baldwin Fairy) i've finally managed to get my old 'wind-up' Windows 1946 pc working.

Naturally, as England (hopefully) progress through the competition the tabloids will pick it up eventually.  Not a lot to report, otherwise...I'm in a call centre for NTL - yes, they're shit, and they know they are - but I have an assessment centre at Porsche on Wednesday!

      *** The Squished Ball Broom Chop ***  Apparently a load of  blokes with too much time on their hands are going to travel the globe to spend hours chasing a funny shaped ball  (kinda like a squished football) . They are going to squabble and fight for it and, as soon as they get it, they kick it away or throw it to the ground. Sounds bloody daft to me, I would take the ball, give it to one team for 45 minutes, let them play catch and chase, NICELY, then let the other team have a turn. Both teams get some good playtime and there would be no 'Broccoli ears'. But it's not up to me, so we have to watch the crap on telly.   To try and make even slightly bearable I have devised an ingenious plan. I have, using all my artistic talent, created a board upon which are placed the flags and names of the nations who want to take part in the silly game. We all pay five New Zealand dollars each and our names are placed in a hat. In absence of a hat, a Tupperware device not unlike an ice-cream tub or sandwich box can be used. Then in a separate plastic storage container, the names of the teams are placed. Then one name is picked from each poly-vessel. A bit like the world cup draw itself.  The team then 'becomes' the person's who's name is drawn and their name is inscribed by the corresponding flag on my beautifully designed board. Please note, when I say 'becomes' that does not mean you own the team, because I think it would cost a lot more than $5, more likely $28  If we sell all 20 tickets there will be $100 dollars in the prize fund.  We have a choice of how the winnings will be split:  A) $10 to the world cup winners, $5 to the team they beat in the final, $85 to Adam for being completely right about the game and investing so much artistic talent into the game. B) $70 to the world cup winners, $30 to the team they beat in the final (commonly known as 'the runner-up')  VOTE A : VOTE A : VOTE A : VOTE A : VOTE A  I know this idea is completely original so I get to name it: I've decided to call it the "The Squished Ball Broom Chop" I think it's a great name and beats the other two I thought of: Brush Joint or Sweep Stake.  Anyway, almost half the places have already gone, so pledge now by blogger and make sure you get your money to one of the Halston Road possie by Friday. One ticket per person until Friday when spare tickets are open to anyone.  In case of dispute the residents of Halston Road + Adam will be Judge & Jury (as always)  God I'm Good!

      Ta muchly Bev-errrrr-leeeeeee. I'm sure we will get a special bottle of something (I'm thinking Signature Range Lemonade) and drink to your good fortune and health.  Annie, did we have a prize for boobies? A well deserved winner, and you came second place in the sweepstake, it must be your lucky day.  I would like to add another $50 to the pot. I think we are still bringing along our own booze, put the pot should cover the extra's like vodka jellies, nibbles and a special bottle of somefink. Carlton Gore is readying itself for you all.  Have a great weekend y'all

      I got this joke today, and as all the rest have been about the AB's I thought you may appreciate it..  :-P  A guy walks into a bar with a dachshund under his arm. The dog is wearing England rugby jersey and is festooned with England pom-poms.  The bartender says, "Hey! No pets are allowed! You'll have to leave. " The guy begs him, "Look, I'm desperate! We're both big fans, the TV's broken at home, and this is the only place around where we can see the game." After securing a promise that the dog will behave, and warning him that he and the dog will be thrown out if there's any trouble, the tender relents and allows them to stay in the bar and watch the game.  The big game begins with the poms receiving the kickoff. They march down field, get stopped at the 22, and kick a penalty goal. Suddenly, the dog jumps up on the bar and begins walking up and down the bar giving high-fives to everyone.  The bartender says, "Wow, that is the most amazing thing I've ever seen! What does the dog do if they score a try?" The owner replies, "I don't know, I've only had him for three years."

      Screw me sideways with a bargepole...we actually won.   Atmosphere back in 'Good 'Ole Blighty' is a bit mad - people keep on going on about '66, as if that's got anything to do with it. Obviously, peeps are on a high. I couldn't stop grinning all yesterday. Perfect finish by Jonny...and we've done it.

      Depends who you ask, Adster...and seeing as you're in NZ, I'd have thought you knew better than that! I object to being labelled a 'poor winner' by anyone from NZ or Oz at the present time, given their penchant for Pom-bashing. I'll gloat at your media - but not at your teams. I'd like to think I recognise good play & appreciate it!  I'm in shock at the events of the weekend. I didn't watch the ABs v Oz, being on a train for 7 hours (oh what joy). When my Dad texted me the full-time score I was certain he must be mistaken.  I watched the England v France game in a bit of a daze, having been out in Edinburgh 'til 4am. As Mike says, it may have been boring rugby, but it suited the conditions...and we won without looking half as shaky as the previous games. 'Nuff said.  Aside from that, the weekend was top. Partied Saturday night 'til 4 with Rach & her mates, then the wedding on Sunday was fantastic. The venue was amazing - Dalhousie castle, about 20 mins out of Edinburgh, and I caught up with a fair few people I hadn't seen for ages. Made it back to the B&B for midnight, and today I've spent another 7 hours on the train. I'm knackered, and tomorrow I drive to Nottingham & back for my Grandmother's funeral.   Don't feel particularly rested, somehow.  Laters,  Matt

      Well well well.....  What's that taste?........ That be humble pie all right, and it don't be tastin no good at all.  I thought I should get in first before Matt sends me to the sword.  I must admit the AB's played like shit. If you miss that amount of tackles and make that many mistakes at this level, you are always gonna lose.  Not taking anything away from the Aussies, they played one of the most complete games I have seen.  I did however watch the Pommy - Frog game..... and as predicted, what a BORING game, my god... The rugby was crap, I know it is winning rugby, but come on...  as you well know I am very much a fan of try's and having a crack, and winning in style - but If you live by the sword u must also die by it..... which we did.  Now for this week, I will not comment on 3rd and 4th as it does not deserve recognition. (great losers us kiwi's)  However I have VERY mixed opinions as to where (if any) my loyalties shall lie.  I have always backed two teams the AB's and any team playing Aussie, however I Hate the French (after our last cup debacle) but found myself supporting them in my dismal state. I don't know if I could handle Smug Poms, they are worse winners than us (especially Matt ) and the boring rugby they play.  The more I contemplate the two the more it hurts. The aussies cant win three cup's, we would never live it down, but at least they attack the line....   5 min pause (with finger pointing up side of face, denoting thinking in body language terms)  I am still unable to declare an allegiance.... I may update this during the week, or wait until the match and see who is playing the more exciting rugby (not up on the board) and reserve my judgment till then.  Yours in dismay and disbelief  Mike

      It's Friday, it's Friday..............Yay 4 us!!!!  My God what a prick of a day......but as it is Friday I will drink all my troubles away - till Monday.  Pity I don't work in a brewery, although I don't think it would be such a good idea as I would considerably shortern my life expectancy.  People can be soooo difficult, y don't they just do as I tell them and every1 would be much better off.  well must be off.......can see me going off for a couple of quiets if I can find a companion or 2.  =P

      Har de har, my Antipodean friend.  As I pointed out to my old boss at ANZ, the Samoans would probably have beaten us - if NZ hadn't nicked half their talent! Think on that when we crush you in the Final :-P  Work is dull & straining - having to use brain for first time in over a year! Nevertheless, it looks promising, plus the great thing about working for a brewery is the amount of freebies you get. My boss is currently blagging as much kit (such as watches, glasses, rugby shirts, t-shirts) as possible off our Marketing department and our 'Guest Ale' breweries for the 'staff raffle'. There's only 8 of us in the team - we're gonna be loaded! And let's not forget the beer vouchers the companie's giving us for Xmas...so it's all good.  My prediction for the rugby...  ABs 32 Oz 15  England 24 France 20  My reasoning - ABs have too much class any which way for the 'whinging Aussies' (a title they deserve far more than us!) and will pummel them into the ground. England v France is a v.tough call. We're back on full strength for the first time since Georgia and the French haven't played any hard games yet. But they will. Oh yes, they will...  My weekend coming is looking manic - Sat travel up to Edinburgh, dump bags at a B&B, straight out again for Rachel's birthday party. Some of you may remember her - Scottish girl with dreads who stayed at Bamber then headed off to Wellington. Sunday is the wedding of 2 friends of mine at Dalhousie Castle - which looks well nice! And then Monday it's straight back home, before me Gran's funeral up in Nottingham on the Tuesday. So I doubt I'll watch any rugby - no texts on Sunday, please, I'll be in church!!  Au revoir.

      Afternoon all,  Since you have all been so slack, and not been a bloggin I thought I should share another weekend story and wind you all up about the Rugby (As the Ab's are gonna smash you all, we goin all the way!! - The Pom's wont even beat the Froggs, and would have to be worried after they were out scored 3 try's to 1 by the Waking Dragon.)  Ok back to my weekend, well it was actually only fri night. - was tooo sore for the rest of the weekend  We had our work ball, picture this....... 600 people most as extroverted as me, most lovin piss as much as me, with unlimited bubbles all night long (or beer etc if ya like).  So it started off quite well I was all dressed up like a penguin - looking smashing of course - get to the door and meet up a few people from my office, grab my first glass of bubbles and head inside... the yarning and drinking continued for about 1 hour, until we were all asked to take our seats for the awards ceremony.  We then had swordfish as an entree and followed by more bubbles, then the night starts to drag on dinner was at about 10pm, by this stage most ppl had decided that food didn't sound too good and that eating was cheating.  We all continued drinking and then a bit of dancing came into the fold, the music was a bit 80's but instead of a band we had a full blown orchestra, and a couple of singers - pretty sweet.  Then in fine company tradition the waiters come out with large glass bowls half full of ice, each having a full bottle of Cointreau on top.  Take the contents of the bottle pour all said contents into ice and place in centre of table for the participants to drink, this is an excellent way to top off the bubbles - so now the night is getting interesting.    We all dance and talk shit for a few more hours, with everyone starting to lose their wheels - Big Time.  Then the lovely Admin Girls from town have the exceptional idea of going to town, so we all jump in Maxi Taxi's and head off to the Viaduct.  We end up at Soul Bar, and have a drink, but I hate that place so head off down to spy bar.  Now this is a bit more my style, excellent Doof Doof,  good ppl and great company.  So we PARTIED there until I gave up and crawled out at about 7.30 am.  If you want further detail you will have to ask as some are classified.  Went back to Halston Rd, crashed for a few hours and went back home to recover, I assumed my recovery position of bean bag upon mattress in front of Telly and watched vids.  Stayed there floating in and out of consciousness until The rugby, proceeded to watch the AB's smash the Bock's, then crashed out.  Did about the same on Sun, then watched the semi-mighty waking Dragon almost upset the pom's.  Would have paid to see that.  So Rugby prediction.......  All Blacks  43  Aussie   23  ----------------------  France  35  Poms either 9 or 12 or 15 or 18 maybe 21 fucken exciting rugby that.  Bring It on!!!!!  How's work Matt - back in the real world - gutted - not as gutting as watching England Lose

It would be nice if everyone bought a nice/interesting bottle of wine - maybe some cheese.... so we can have a civilised sup whilst watching the rugby on Saturday night! You'll need to bring towels and Duners, if you need direction give me a shout.  The Resident One!

Pete, small suggestion, if you want to pop down to Comet and get your self a DVD burner, you can merge the mpeg and jpegs together and play them 'as a movie'. I'm sure you have nothing better to do with you time!  Cheers mate, please may I have a limited edition 'Halston Hits' DVD/CD please, can I, can I, Puh-leeeeeeeeeease

      The theme to that Air NZ advert...by The Zephyrs - 'I know where I'm going to...' or whatever it's called. I've got that on CD so can pop over at some point with it. Plus summat by Groove Armarda to highlight the madness of that concert.  Otherwise...can't think! No Justin Timberlake, Goddammit! Though I suppose we should have something by Boney M in there to appease Adam!  And now, on with my work as I listen to George FM over the web.... *sigh*

      Sitting here pondering stuff on Boxing Day, I've started putting together a definitive music playlist of memorable tracks from our time in NZ. I'll assemble the tracks and burn them onto a cd. I'm seeking suggestions of what should be on, and if you're nice I'll do you all a copy of the cd once I've finished.  Any style is acceptable, given that already on the list are goldenhorse, nesian mystic and southpark...  Artist and track are required for inclusion, or at least enough information for me to be to track the music down.  Also, disputes about the final playlist may be referred to me, which I shall consider at length and then probably overrule.  Hugs  P.

      Oh, the vagaries of the weekend. Once more I have been struck with both ups & downs which, quite frankly, have left me wondering what the fuck is going on.  On Saturday I had the pleasure of attending the RAF Valley Christmas Ball (for Kiwis & non-Welsh geographers, that's North Wales - Anglesey) as a guest of the father of a very close friend of mine. Drove up there Friday, caught up with mates in Bangor - for those that met them, Katie & Mos say hi - then Saturday was spent in preparation...haircut, buying new cufflinks, watching Lynne & co have hysterics about hair & dresses. Which was amusing in itself.  The Ball was fantasic - great company, good food, reasonable music, and a free bar. Added to that, I actually pulled (for the 2nd time since I've been back) and had a splendid time with the young lady concerned.   Unfortunately, reality dawned rather harshly on Sunday. Another death in the extended family, a death of a friend from Uni, and then I got pulled over & ticketed for speeding. Fucking fantastic.  I do apologise for this - I've just re-read it & am thinking it's a bit doom & gloom. Fear not - 'tis the end of the year soon, and I, for one, shall be quite glad to let it slip away quietly so I can focus on making the next one even more memorable - I shall commence stockpiling for the great Bamber reunion as soon as I can, and with any luck shall be on hand to welcome peeps as they return, as I live a mere 45 minutes from Heathrow.  Au revoir.

      **** TOP TIP ****  Bus Good - Taxi Bad  With 250,000 people coming to my lickle house you can bet your bottom dollar it's going to be busy. The council has sent through a letter with all the road closures etc so you are more than welcome to sit in a taxi for hours OR you could take one of the many Carol Special Buses.  A comprehensive list of buses can be found at http://203.109.146.34/auckland/news.html near the bottom of the page  Callum is arranging for the DJ to start shortly after the last firework fades, make sure you bring plenty of grog as it will be very difficult to top up on the night. If you want to drop stuff off at the house (like change of clothes or bottles for the evening) you can from about 2pm to 3:30pm, after which, I will be joining the rest of the gang on a rug in the park. Unless the weather is bad, the house will most likely be locked from 4pm to until the concert finishes. If it's semi-bad the I'll be waiting in mah house, if it's very bad the concert will be postponed to the Sunday BUT the party will continue at Carlton Gore.  The party has a theme "White Trash - New Lynn on the Park". The other flatties have told their friends to come dressed up (or dressed down) as white trash.  PLEASE don't get tooooooo hammered on Friday night as I'm now paranoid that by 10pm you'll all go home and I'll be left at my own party with no friends  Can't wait to see you all.  Cheers me babbers Adam

       Carols in the Park/Carlton Gore Xmas Xtravaganza   Plan A - Nice weather  Get to Domain between 3 & 4pm, picnic, chilly bin & numerous rugs (and sun screen) to ensure good spot for following festivities.  Go back to Adams after singing our little hearts out and drinking ourselves silly!  Plan B - Shite weather Skulk around to Adams 6ish to 'get in the mood'/console ourselves over the crappy weather. Nip out at last minute to mingle with the masses (250,000 people expected!), Sing our little hearts out then go back to Adam's to drink ourselves silly!  Ridiculous numbers of people expected, so probably a good idea to leave cars at Halston and we'll get a taxi across...  Sunday is the last full Posse ensemble, Jamie flies out that night, Jo the following night, Kat and Pete the following week.  A general gathering at Halston is of course on the cards, but some 'event options' have been mentioned, namely in the areas of 10 pin bowling and ice skating!  Sounds like good hangover material to me!  I think we will play it by ear/headache!  Anyone is free to crash at ours on Saturday night, but we are expecting a VERY full house, so if you have a tent please bring it!  Or van to sleep in!!! Oh and bedding!    HALSTON XMAS DINNER, SATURDAY 20th DEC.   $20 per head for HUGE slap up Xmas seafood buffet with all the trimmings.  Money to be collected and Secret Santa's drawn this weekend at Adam's. The majority of the Rugby kitty is going to be used as a float for our Xmas do, mainly because so many people are expected to Adams (250,000 remember!) it is going to be nigh impossible to keep a BLACKPACKERS drink stash in safe hands!!!  Looking forward to seeing you all at the weekend.... Party on!

      Well Hello All !!!!  I'm back at work after a most marvelous holiday, had a great time up north - partied as only a 23 year old can (got to take it while I can, sorry Kat and all other un-young ppl  :-P  )  - and I do have a bit of a tan (many hard earned hours in the blistering sun)  well I must say something else quickly before the backlash hits......Hmmmm what to say.  I'd like to Say NZ is great, but it does feel a tad empty having been abandoned by you all.  Had another Airport send off when I went to see Ged flee the country. Also had the pleasure of Going to his leaving party and yes Vikki was slightly intoxicated, but was adamant she was going dancing - until her body decided that maybe that wasn't such a good idea, and home to bed was preferable.  I must also apologize for not writing earlier, and yes it did take me a while to read all the goss and update myself. Lovely pics of NYE (did the top of it say 2003???) and to those of you who have been spending unnatural periods of time looking blankly at computers and playing stupid google games I have a lovely treat for you.  This game will amuse you for at least a day maybe more.  My highest score is 323.4 and I know another person who got 323.5 (but I think they just said that to beat me - bastards)   http://1337-face.dk/pingvin.htm  Ohhh - fun isn't it.....  Must be off  Loads of Luv n Hug's 2 u all Mike  xx oo

      To anyone sat at their desk, staring forlornly at the screen...i have discovered a new and fun way to procrastinate.  Last night at the Dave Gorman show, i was introduced to 'Googlewhacking'. What the bugger is that? Well its an internet word game where you enter two random, obscure and unrelated words into the Google search engine, e.g. Ragnorok Dugong or Dork Turnspit - if Google only finds one site in the whole universe containing those two words, you have yourself a Googlewhack. There are rules however: no inverted commas, they must be words in the dictionary and word lists don't count.  Now i know what you're thinking....Kat's been spending way too much time with Pete and has morphed into a net geek.  Well you may be right but i defy you to try it once and not get addicted...go on, you know you want to.  Be warned, you will be confronted with all kinds of unimaginable degradation on your quest!

      At this precise point, I have the choice between going downstairs to do my tax return, or sitting here and writing something brief yet witty for the blog...  Right, this weekend saw the first of a couple of reunions around here when Ms Fish and myself met up with Ross and Amanda and the elusive, yet finally rediscovered Seb and Sadie. This was in the somewhat contrived name of Ross' birthday, and we actually went to the theatre and did not drink that much. Hard to believe, and actually had a really good time. Actually untrue, I forgot, did drink cos at the end of the evening we met up with a friend of Kat's who introduced us to a new late night drinking venue. Always an exciting event in these bloody isles when everything usually shuts at 11pm.  Other than this, arrangements continue for the NZ reunion in a couple of weeks which at the moment includes (somewhat tentatively)  Me, Kat, Matt, Bev, Sue, Welchy, Seb, Sadie, Ross, Amanda, Penny, Jo, Jamie, Lyndsey, Matt's exhousemates who I can't remember, and many many others...  On other news, Fish has an interview at a temping agency tomorrow,  and I am due to give my old work a call back today about a 3 month contract paralegalling. Money fairly shite (although several times what you earn you antipodean wasters! (please excuse my jealous rage - I must seek solace in what I can), but am in need of some income in these cold Londinium times.  Oh yes, and theres a great story about Seb being locked out of his hotel room in Vegas, in the middle of the night, NAKED...  Hugs n stuff. My tax return is calling.  Pete

      ...I feel like shit today!! Ged..I dont actually remember being at your leaving party....Im sure it was great. We started drinking in the garden at 2.30 so by 10pm I wasnt really sure where I was. I can safely say I have completely written off my Monday holiday. Adam...I promise not to be contaminating your beautiful blue bus...as for the answers to your questions...you will have to wait and see. I hate to admit that I totally forgot it was burns night..I guess that could be my excuse for getting drunk last night. The London posse....I have been looking at flights to come visit. Problem is it wont be a weekend as I have hen nights and weddings.... Matt said you guys may come up but I guess it will depend on work. Anway...I will stop bletherin'...must go lie down again.. Hugs Vick xx

      Indeed. Happy Burns Night to all the pseuds :-)  In the meanwhile...Friday was quite a drastic night for me too....Jo & I went partying in Reading. And yea, verily, we had lots to drink and found somewhere decent playing 'doof-doof' music. I have no idea what time I left, or whether or not I payed the taxi driver. And I had an all-day hangover yesterday...not fun when you're trying to move house.

      Well well well Bev, things never change do they. Slurred "I love you" coversations and waking up in a pool of vomit (some else's earns you extra points) that's class, top class. Nice to see your not letting the side down even when in the Northern Hemisphere.  Vucky, you may expect a ride in the beautiful blue bus, but as I emailed your friend Kirsty, you have to pass three tests BEFORE you are considered:   Stage One   1) Are your hygene levels high enough to make sure you do not dirty the beautiful blue bus or contaminate her 2) Are you moral levels high enough not to corrupt the beautiful blue bus or any of her passengers 3) Are you music tastes high enough to appreciate Boney-M on all the levels they reach out to  If you have answered  YES  to all three then proceed to stage two    Stage Two   You also have to answer the following questions a) Have you ever, are you currently or would you consider having a threesom b) Have you ever, are you currently or would you consider having sex with a member of the same sex c) Have you ever, are you currently or would you consider having sex with a member of the animal kingdom (excluding Joe) d) Have you ever, are you currently or would you consider having sex with a member of your family  There is no right or wrong answer to these questions, I just think it would be interesting to know.  Goodness, I have typed loads without even talking about  MEEEEEE , what is the world coming to ... anyway ... back to me. I have just finished a flight and cruise to Milford Sound, it was AMAZING. Highly recommend it. There, cruise and back again in four hours, that's the same time it takes just to drive one way! Off to Duneden in the morning, then I start the hike back up the east coast.  Starting to get a bit lonely on the open road, can't wait to catch up with the Welly crew on the 6th.  Love to all, always a pleasure, NEVER a chore Adam

      Kat - I'm sharing a bed with her in the Pete Porn Palace???  Who is she??? (and more importantly was she good, looked like she wasn't sharing her tongue with you!)  I woke up this morning with my jeans soaked in someone else's vomit which was enough to make my hangover even worse, lots of gritty bits on the floor which i'd brushed off with my bare hands before i knew what it was... eeeuuuuggh.  Welcome back to England.  matt - good job i ran out of phone juice, cos i think our conversation for the first few minutes was 'matt, i love you, i really love you matt'...  a messy night.  love to all of you! big hugs B x

      Sweet as.. Finally back up and running on blogger...thnk Im logged in as Annie though. Its been a crazy few months...big changes in the house, piss ups, parties and sun at last YEAH!! At last I know why Im here. I was getting a wee bit worried that winter would never end. Had a fairly quiet Xmas without you guys. Was fun but very different..... Had to work over the festive season...still managed a fair few wild nights though!!! BIG DAY OUT last week..wasnt impressed with the set up..didnt manage to get a beer all day..but the line up was great and I guess thats what is about!! Been leading Annie astray..had her out on the piss a few times...and poor Frankie..I think he spent a little too much time with me while Al was away... last text I got he was watching TV sipping a G & T  so all good. So next trip is on 6th of feb and I will finally make it south of Taupo. Annie and I are off to meet Hamish and Adam in Wellington for the 7s. Gonna spend a few days travelling back to Auckland in the beautiful blue bus. Well apart from that no goss ....cause Im not like that ;0) Im off for a wee glass of wine..just the one of course... ..Hugs to you all...stay smiley :0)   Vick xx

      Just waiting for my helicopter ride to Frans Josef/ Fox Glaciers and around Mt Cook, so I thought I would just let you know that Al was right, the South Island rocks! It's so beautiful and I've been very lucky with the weather, only one grey day, the rest have been big blue skies with fluffy white clouds popping in to say hello.  I do miss Auckland though, it's quite strange not to be able to pop around and see at least one of the blackpacks at any given time.  I'm in Queenstown on Saturday, does anyone know if Rory or Ramsey is still there and if so, what their emailmbile number is?  Always a pleasure Never a chore  Adam

Just to fill in anyone who has not heard yet Yes i did catch a large brown trout, Hamish did not....HO...HO.. Happy New year love Raddles, Franky and Chase the nutless wonder dog.

      Hi Honies.... Well Halsron hasn't lost is touch (just some loved ones...) our guest list over the next few weeks is somewhat crowded, I think we could be topping 10 in the house when my parents come over... may have to take up Pete's plan and boys go pee in the garden!  Adam - bumped into the mad Welsh possy in Taupo... they were by no means offended, in fact that night will go down in their 'travellers tales' .  All good babe!  Talking of travellers tales - have you racked any up yet!!!?!  Summer showers here at the mo, but the rain is needed as the place is tinder dry, well is was up until a few days ago... sun again now please!  Jamie, your post is on the way.... good to hear from you... let us know your number when you get sorted : ) Good luck on the job front x  Pete and Kat - will be ringing you soon.  Most excellent photos!  Oh my God! you were pole dancing!  Any chance you can get H on Blogger too?  Matt - got your message about the stamps - thank you so much!  Let me have you phone number so I can ring you!   So fluffy bunnies, keep on having heaps of fun and doing daft things! (and putting the evidence on Blogger!)

      Good God...there seem to be far too many pictures of me around....must avoid people with digital cameras if at all possible from now on....  FINALLY, I should be getting out of my parents' house. It has been a long, hard slog to get back to somewhere even approaching a steady financial income, but I have a room at l'hotel chez Binks (my old flatmates' unfortunate surname - and no, he isn't Ja-Ja) which has been furnished & looks like all my rooms do prior to me moving in - clean!   Over a couple of evenings this week, I should be helping Andy set up stuff downstairs (and actually make room for 2 people to be able to live there), and then moving in over the weekend. Which is nice.

      Bizzare but true, I have finally got access to the blog(thanks Katfish), I've been back in Ireland for a about two weeks now, all is very odd, well different at least. I've not been in contact much I'm afraid,excuses as follows. No phoneline connected at the house yet. Have applied for it,ergo no internet. I'm working away with the engineering company that I was sort of involved with before I left. Going good. Spent NYE with the delightful Kat and Pete( much thanks)(will be over to grab stuff very soon,just trying to organise a meeting in london so the company pays for it). Adam, hope Oz was good for you keep me posted on travels. Annie,Whats this I read, you and haggis!! More!!!!! Vicky, look forward to seeing you when you get back for weddings etc!! MAtt, good to hear about contract!!! Jo, hope alls well. And to everyone I forgot>get over it  Love from Ireland  Me

I had only been to the bar once before and it honestly didn't have such 'gay' feel to it. Humblest apologies Adam

      Me? Scandal? Femmes du jour? You must have me mistaken for someone else, surely. I'm single...I think! But I'll get back to you on that.  Well. Anyhow. It was indeed a good weekend, and I am tired. Again. Thankfully, nought on but work for the forseeable future, although a possible house move beckons this weekend.  Unfortunately, not a lot to report. Contract being extended at work 'til end of March, hopefully should be made permanent then. Seen Jo's pub near Henley - clientele best described as very Ab Fab, dahling. Most amusing - should be dragging the Jo-ster out for some serious 'dooff-dooff' sessions in oh-so-glamourous Reading soonish.  Beyond that, I am merely keeping my head down and ignoring the world as best as I can.

      IT is cold here, and it is dark, often raining too just to top things off.  However, have just come back from top weekend in Bangor. Fish and I went up for a respite from the London gloom, and Matt was up there visiting his femme du jour. Cue big piss up in very very dodgy Bangor nightclub, large double tequilas etc etc, cleaning out KFC at 2 am etc etc and etc.  Now it is Tuesday, we are back in the land of the unemployed. I am having lunch in a minute with my old boss and might see if I can get some short term work out of him, Fish is sending cv's to temp agencies today. We shall see how this pans out before taking next option. Rest of day is filled up with tax returns and driving licence applications... fun fun and double fun.  Kat has joined a poi course here though so should be getting know lots of crusties which should make a change from all my dodgy law mates...  NZ reunion at my house first weekend in Feb if any of you fancy it. Are back in contact with Seb and Sadie, went drinking with Ross and Amanda last week too.   Same old shit, just colder.  Pete  Sorry about your phone Schmanny, fnarr fnarr.

      HAPPY NEW YEAR!  Apologies to anyone reading this who thinks I have been ignoring their calls/texts, but my phone went walkies on NY Eve - Bugger!  Still 2004 is all very exciting at the mo, after a fab holiday with my boys, Hamish and Al, I now get to look forward to seeing my mum and dad for the first time in 18 months next month : )  Things also simmering away, when and where Hamish and I will live together (don't tell Vicky but my exit from Auckland is on the cards....) In fact me and the old Gal are off to the capital for Waitangi weekend : )  Talking of Vix she is definately leading me astray.... first dragging me to Summerdaze (via the kindly Paul, friend of Katfish, getting me on the guest list) for a big dancey dancey night and an extravagent 4am return, only to do it all again the next night via the Hydrant (Adam you really should have mentioned that was a gay bar - poor old Welsh Dan and Angus were somewhat Gay struck!), Cuba and Coast   : )  The weather has been gorgeous, so the beach is on the agenda at every opportunity, dare I say we are even getting a tan!  Hope you are all happy and healthy wherever you are,  Any news on the job front Pete or Kat, Jamie, Joe or Jo? ANy more scandel Matt?  Blimey there are more of you there than here now : (   !!  Anyways bunnies take care and keep in touch  Annie xxxxxxxx

      Can you believe it!    I am coming home!!!    And bringing Hamish with me!   My Mum as some of you know, has been taken ill - (on the road to recovery now) but I still want to come home and give her a hug! So H and I are heading home for a week leading up to Easter.  Vicky is confirming the flights as we speak... (Vicky is also home at the same time!)  So when's the party?! Seriously, I am coming home to spend some quality time with my parents (who live the other side of Cardiff)  , but I'll be buggered if I don't track a few of you down around the place whilst I am home! Hils is also in London that week!  The real trick is going to be getting Vicky down from Scotland (And Jamie from ireland)as she it tied up every weekend....  Answers on a postcard please!  Hope to hear from you all soon Hugs Annie

      Pete - I ended up with 2 pints of cider all down my jeans as well...which was fabulous as I had to wear them the next morning when going back to Gemma's....tasteful. Vengeance will be mine. Oh yes, it will be mine.  It definately looked as if everyone was having a great time - though the DJs were both so smashed they couldn't remember half the requests 2 minutes afterwards!  In my defence, the massage started off with an old friend and her boyfriend...and then I got requests! Thankfully I'm pretty sure the photos aren't TOO embaressing of me - though I'm looking forward to seeing the one's of Bev!   *cackles gleefully*

      Ahh, back at work on a Monday morning - I knew there was something I had missed all that time mucking around in miserable New Zealand, all you have is raging floods and floating cows now I understand.  Anyway, whahay, we do at least keep the social/alcohol/debauchery traditions in strong form however, this weekend in Bangor, site of the fish's coming of age bash, complete with lots of people, Jamie trying it on with small Japanese women, Matt massaging furiously and a lot of lollipops. Not to mention me pouring two pints of lager and Matt's vodka and coke down my jeans all with one brief flick of a toe... bloody dice game...  I think everyone had a good time - there was quite a good NZ contingent there, Bev and Ged snogging conspicuously by the bar, Jamie and Matt.  Photos up in the next couple of days.  P

Have a blast my darling : ) You are and angel and I love you dearly, Auckland is all the emptier for your absence. I have some great photos from the past few months especially of your beloved and my boys(H and Al).  On my web site soon... Why Am I posting this on Blogger not you personal email?  Can't be arsed quite frankly to log back in, and partly cos I want people to know (what a lush I am - no!) quite how lovely you are and I want to start a 'let's praise Katfish' movement!  Mojito's are evil things ain't thay!  Take care my chicken and wish me all the best for my hangover inthe morning!  Here's to the dirty thirties - bring it on! Big hugs babe Axxx

      Outragious suggestion from ole sweedy there.  Yes you can text abroad, whats more, once your texts hit the ten dollar mark, they are free for the rest of the month. What´s more you can broadcast text, that is, text many people abroad at once, like I did everytime I was atop a volcanoe or just jumped from a plane. What´s more I have already hit the ten dollar mark for Feb and there is twelve dolla credito on the phone, so until the end of March, it will cost Annie nothing to text Pete with the following message as much as she wants "Pete has an unhealthy interest in cucumbers and castrol GTX"  There seems to be a tiny problemo receiving them though. I have had texts from my mum and my sister, but another sister and friend have not been able to send or reply. La Fishy Kat claimed she was unable to send texts from England, but I believe that, when I turned down her sexual advances she got psycho, and the court order stopped telecom conecting her phone to mine.  Hands up anybody going to the white continent next week!  ps, Thanks to Matt unt Mike for  urlLink leaving messages  on mah web site. I have replied to both.

      ¡Gracias! Peter - for pointing out the error of my links, should be fixed now  Annie, any outragious text messages from unknown hunks, please pass them on.  Buenos Aires is a great city - it´s fantastic here, and there was even a street party outside my hostel last night to welcome me here. Didn´t quite reach the Auckland 200k standard, but was very nice of them to put it on for me.  I can´t remember if I ever mentioned it, but this time next week, I´ll be in ANTARCTICA.  PS, I just about remember the following conversation, but can´t remember who it was with or how it went exactly, but if you know anything about it, let me know. It went something like this...  other person: You are leaving? me: Yes, I am going to Antarctica (very unlike me, because I hate talking about it) other person: I thought your accent was funny!  Who was this person? I want to know because I´ve never been mistaken for an Antarctican before.  AAPNAC Adam

       ´Time to say Goodbye´  Thank you everyone for making this weekend better than I could have ever asked for as my last weekend in New Zealand. Inviting 200,000 of my closest friends, the Auckland Fill-her-monic (what´s a ´monic´?) and to put on such a firework display was more than I deserved. I will miss you all.  I am here in Argentina, got a window seat with a spare seat next to me, so I was sitting pretty on the 10 hour flight. I have however, gone back in time and arrived 2 hours before I took off, which is very strange.  I will try and do emails, but all my news will be on  urlLink www.abtayler.co.uk   Thank you so much for a great year, and here´s to many more ...  Up your bum, don´t tell mum   Love ya

      Yes Bev, about that secret...... go on you can tell us, we wont tell, we're real good at keepin secrets :-)  Just a quick note form everyone's fav Kiwi - that being me... I have a HUGH weekend planned - I have an ex-work mates Stag do tonight, which involves going out on a boat at 7pm and getting dropped off at the Viaduct at 11pm, horribly drunk with a big group of mates..... the rest I shall leave to your imagination.  Then on Sat after I recover from my hangover, we have a lovely picnic in the Domain, followed by laser lights and a symphony... as per last domain drinkathon I may partake in a few bubbles...... the rest I shall leave to your imagination.  My closing comment shall be about the magnificent day we are having, there is not a cloud in the sky, nor a flutter of wind - shall be a perfect day for drinking in the harbor and gettin completely smashed - so I am unable to remember any of it.  much love 2 you all  Mike the lovable Kiwi

      Indeed a fun weekend, but I dont remember Pete having a camera, so I'm a little worried...  let's hope he didn't snap Jo groping my left breast on the dance floor (thanks Jo).    Adam thank you for not posting my secrets on blog!!  Annie, thank you for not squeezing my other secrets out of me on speaker-phone when I was very drunk and easily swayed...  Anyway I am fully ready for a birthday Fish so bring it on...

      *Yawn*  In work, feeling a tad battered. That weekend was truly top notch - even if I can't remember the majority of Thursday night! Thinking I'm going to sleep for a couple of weeks before I can even contemplate the birthday of Fish.  Valentine's Day is coming, so I hereby invite the populace of this board into a prolonged 'bah humbug!'.  Cheers Ears.....

      Hi.   Yes, well, despite all the planning in the world, we ended up at that boat and they wouldn't let us in for Waitangi Day - jees. Beautiful irony indeed.  Lots of people came, in their own good time, Seb and Sadie, Ross and Amanda, Jamie, Bev, Sue, Welchy, and myself and the Fish and various other hangers on...  I do recall kind of talking to you guys, although it was much more of a yell down the phone from my part rather than anything more coherent.  No photos yet, but will put them up when we get them back.  Two weeks brings us the Fish 30th, which frankly will be more of the same. I can't say more at this point 'cos its a secret...  Hugs from us all.  Pete

      Hello to you all!  Hope you had a great time on the boat on the Thames,  (sorry but we quite liked the irony about not being able to get on one cos of Waitangi day!) It was lovely to speak to you all - brought a tear to the eye and a big smile to our faces! My my my, you did start early didn't you - we thought 8.30 would be a safe bet for a semi coherent chat!  We had a look at all our photos from Austin Powers, Taupo 1, 2, 3 etc, Halston House warming, Halloween etc Happy Happy days!  We miss you all heaps and look forward to the day we are ALL together again... (Weddings are always good for that sort of thing!  Any offers!!!)  Big Hugs  Annie, Hamish, Adam and Vicky xxxx the New Zealand die hards!

      Dearest Kat,  OF COURSE I'm going to make you sit through a slide show, boring people is what I do best, it's a gift I was born with. I will also re-tell the same old stories (only slightly more exaggerated each time), until you beg for mercy or fall in to a coma.  Have you caught up with "Tricky Vicky Licky Sticky Dicky" yet?  I go to Mendoza on Wednesday, wine capitol of Argentina. I will crack open a bottle for you all whilst there.  AAPNAC Adam

Stu, i sincerely hope you are not too jetlagged because we have plans for you on Monday night my sweet...  Re: our skiing trip, yes, i'm ashamed to say that i did bitch about being forced to drink every night...but what pete neglected to tell you was that for each unintentional double entendre and moment of f*ckwittage, i was required to down a large glass of toxic French table wine as a fine.  Needless to say i was necking a considerable amount of booze each night and, in fact, won the trip trophy for having the most fines.  Having never won a trophy before, i was inordinately proud that it was awarded to me for being a tw*t (excuse the French).  Adam, i think your photos are absolutely incredible, but if you ever make me sit through a slide show it could be the end of a beautiful friendship!  Oh Vicky, where are you????????????????????  hugs xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Anyway, Fish and I went skiing, and apart from Fish bitching about having to drink too much (I kid you not!), a great time was had by all. I even managed to get Fish off piste, down a red run and parallel turning by the end of the week through my own sensei-esque abilities....  Our diminuitive blond friend mr hot chicken is coming to stay at le hotel Baldwin on Monday, the latest in a long succession of NZ visitors.  Am suitably excited by imminent arrival of lots of people.  but if I have to look at another bloody picture of ice bergs........  Hugs - Pete

Have not had a weekend in Auckland for about a month..... but always come back with a smile on me face  =P Al stole the telly, Al stole the telly, Al stole the telly!!! I'm unsure if this is common knowledge yet (don't want to steal your thunder Al) but Al and Franky have moved to Wellington and have moved in with Hamish.. So we are currently looking for two new flattened, so if you know of any Swedish volleyball players who are in need of accommodation, send them our way..   and Thank you Matt, the Mighty chiefs are standing up (finally) but if they get talked up too much they will crumble like houses on the banks of the Manawatu River... Well must be off - got work to do and all..  Much love to you all *Mwah* Mike, the now almost completely alone Kiwi (will live, if only just)

      Hold your horses, m'dear! Housewarming dependant on the landlord - who's far too laid back (just like me) - finally sorting out his remaining furniture so we can move a loada crap from downstairs.  As for the tinnies, they don't start piling in until I actually go permanent - which may be up to 2 months away! Bloody contracts....  Oh, Mike, been following the S12....go those Cheifs! Splendid start to the season.

      Congratulations Mattus! When's the house warming then? - as you don't drink beer i can only conclude that you have a vast stockpile of tinnies somewhere!    Michael....well i've been publicly chastised for slack netiquette, oops... sorry babe, don't have email at work yet coz i am but a lowly temp and its something of a battle to get the Baldwin boys off the PC at home but i will try harder!  Happy Birthday for the 8th Schmannie!!  Welcome to the dirty thirties.  Can't say that i have had any sudden urges to nest or produce baby Baldwins...thank god!  Sorry we won't be there to party with you but we can have Birthday Mark II in a few weeks when you return.  Adam, i have a question...are penguins edible?  Well we're off to hit the piste in Meribel, French Alps on Sunday, its minus 30 on the top slopes at the mo, although probably not half as cold as the Antarctic.  I shall be wearing thermals with uplift padding now that i am old and saggy!  Hugs katfish xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hi all,  One of the lonely abandoned 1's down 'ere in this hemisphere, just writing to let you all know I'm still alive.  and yes Adam there is 1 question that I have been dying to know the answer.  How far do penguins really fly when u smash them with a club???   So it sounds like there is going to be a huge contingent of you all in that other hemisphere, whilst some of us are left all alone at the bottom of world.  And young miss Fish, I know I cannot txt u nor u me, but u have no excuse for not replying to emails, especially solicited 1's - consider yourself told.  Umm what else, Stu has also just left our lonely hemisphere, for that polluted, over crowded, smelly 1.  I think thats about all for now.  Much Love to you all Mikey

      Hello me babbers, ow'bis?  Tis back from a tres chilly big white place, not too sure if you knew, but I´ve been to Antarctica (don't like to mention though). I am indeedy back in late June  IF  I can change my ticket. Having BIG problems with the airline over here! Thanks for all the birthday messages and emails, I am working through the pile now and should reply soon(ish) if you have sent me an email. Big hugs to Kat and big hugs to Annie March is Birthday Bonanza.  My sister finally dropped her sprog, she had a massive 9lb2oz chubster boy that she has called Connor Jay. (not Adam!) Mother and wrinkly spew machine doing very well.  I can confirm the following: There really isn't much of a gay scene in Antarctica. Penguins do walk funny Seals bite Penguins shit in VAST amounts all over the place Seals stink Ice is cold I did a naked swim in the Antarctic Ocean, I now have two ice cubes and a ice pole, frost bite is not nice. Big waves and small boats do not mix If you kick a penguin on ice they slide quite far  Any Antarctic questions not answered above please feel free to ask.  Love to all All way a pleasure, Never a chore

      Am I the last of the nerdy knee bloggers? It's gone all quiet.  Here's a question for all those who got a few stars on the Halston Family Tree (remember, you got a coloured star for each weekend away you attended)  Do you fancy reliving all those good old days with a weekend away on the coast somewhere?  I am thinking mid-September when the weather is still warmish, but the prices have dropped. I am happy to organise. Pass the word on to all without blogger.  Big thanks to Annie, Kat and Matt who have all signed my guestbook recently (geeks!) It's important to hear from home when you are away (as you all know!)  So how about it? Weekend away? Coastal Cottage or caravan? Or three days on a canal in a long boat? If we are all within reach of a EasyJet Airport perhaps even a weekend away to Barcelona or Nice in November or Early December (I did it just before I left and it cost me 35 quid return (Bristol to Nice) and 12 quid a night in a dorm. Was about 20c in the day, bit chilly at night, but the Christmas lights and shopping in Nice was FANTASTIC.  Who's in???? Answers by email adam@abtayler.co.uk or by this blogger or via my webpage (guestbook)  I am going to send this via email to the few email addresses I have so if it's a repeat, hard luck.  Always a pleasure and NEVER a chore Love Always Adam The Organiser

Saying that, because I am geographically challenged I will not be able to attend any of the mentioned events, much to my distress. But have a VERY happy birthday with muchos birthday greating sent from Bolivia.  Annie, thank you for leaving a message on my web site, it's starting to look like I have friends now the 'guest book' is not empty!  All's well in South West Earth, Love to all the bunnies in South East Earth and see all the f***ing northeners of Earth on my return.  Wee problem with the photography course. I have applied to do a National Diploma on my return. The tutor of the ND course thought my work was good enough to do an HND course and passed it on to the relivent tutor, who agreed. (big head time for Addie, I can tell you) ... BUT ... The HND course has closed and I have to wait to clearing in August. BUMMER!  Looks like I might have to wait a year, by which time, I will be settled and unable to cope with missing the wage I have got used to! I am still in contact with the tutors, so something might be worked out, but I doubt it.  Oh well, will have to WORK!!! for a living I suppose, how nasty!  Love always Adam

      Well, what can I say!  How lovely was it to see you all!  Long may your fantastic reunions continue, provided H and I get to pop in once in a while!  I guess there will be another one soon for the other Bristol boy when he returns to the dear ol' shores of Blighty Gawd bless her and all who drink on her!  Its nice to be back in Kiwiland, but it does mean me and the boy are parted once more - I really must rectify that one soon - anyone know how to right a good CV?!  I surprised even myself with a 16 drinking session on Saturday - there is life in this old dog yet!  Anyway honies, I miss you all so very much but it was great to feel the friendship is a strong as ever, you are all ace! (God I always get soppy don't I?)  Anyways take care, (and my mum is doing very well, thank you very much for asking all!)  Love and BIG BEAR HUGS! Annie aka MUM!

      'tis the night before Friday, and what a relief a short week is!  Fish is asleep already, I've moved the computer into the now vacated spare room so I can dweeb at leisure.  Last Thursday was really really fab, all it is with genuine sadness that I had to say goodbye to Annie and Hamish. We've had some good reunions already, but this one had a real tinge of the good old days. If only cos we bought lots of booze (a lot of which is still sitting in my booze cupboard - thanks Hamish!). Am sitting here listening to George FM talk about (late) summer mornings and wishing we were all still there planning our Friday night piss up....  Another big weekend here though, me and Fish and my bro going to big Swedish ball at the weekend at the "Honorable Artillery Company". Won't be that honorable once we've finished with it...  Hugs to you all you lovely people.  Pete

      *sigh* What a week.  It's been fantastic for seeing old friends - Thursday was great, Friday I was up in Bangor, Sunday I saw a friend I haven't seen for ages, same happened Tuesday, and last night I met up with a mate who's been in Kalgoolie for 2 years - one of the few foreigners whose job is, simply put, to 'blow up Australia'! Fantastic!  On the other hand, work is very, very confusing. We have no idea what's going on, it looks like more people may leave given the right incentive...I'm confused and not a little worried. But hey, I get free booze, so I can happily stay in a haze....

      A few observations about Chile...  1) It's not chilly, it should be renamed hot'n'sweaty 2) It's long and thin 3) everyone under 30 is stunning 4) everyone over 35 is fat and ugly 5) I don't want to find out what happens inbetween 6) Chillies grow in Chile, but they are not Chilly, they are hot 7) People think you are utterly mad if you take tea with any less than seven sugars 8) Just had a thought, the bottom bit is chilly, and so are the bits high in the Andes 9) Siesta is a pain in the arse 10) I don't take siesta, so why should the 200 million Spanish and Latino people of the world, don't they know how annoying it is when everything closes between 1pm and 3pm 11) It's very inconvenient and I am going to write a letter about it. It's just not cricket. 12) Chile is great and the people are really nice (except between 1pm and 3pm when they all disappear)

Just one thing though - if, upon your return, you try and force us to sit through a slide show of  all   your photos, I, for one, will be forced to resort to violence.

      And one, two, three...and breath...relax....be at one with the universe...go and listen to some whale music or something...did that help at all? No? Oh well...eat some chocolate, I find that always works.  Hmm. Interview Weds morning went well...I think. So I've got an offer from the brewery and a potential offer from my old company. Which is nice. Pissed off at the weather after 2 days of glorious sunshine, and really wanting to be at home - either in bed or watching the third series of the West Wing, which my housemate bought last night. I suspect I'll have no life for at least the next week....

      Last night, some **** (insert your own word there) decided to play his ******* trumpet at ******* 1am for a ******** two hour ******* session. I decided to skip spanish school this morning as I was tres tired, only to be awoken by the same ****, playing the ******* thing at 9am. Fucker! (ooop's, I mean ******!). As you might be able to tell, I am a little moody this morning.  OUT WITH HATE, IN WITH LOVE OUT WITH HATE, IN WITH LOVE OUT WITH HATE, IN WITH LOVE OUT WITH HATE, IN WITH LOVE  Nope, it's not worked, he's still a complete and utter mo.fo.  Enough of the pleasentaries, I have to go and feel angry and sorry for myself, it's going to be a busy day.  Last nigt was not a pleasure, but undoubtedly a chore. I thought I would cheer myself up by thinking of all of you.... God, now I'm really depressed!  ha ha ha  Love Adam

      What a larff,  I am in therapy after being mooned by Katt and trying to recover from outrageous facial hair upon Pete's face. I got caught by people walking past my booth several times making faces and sticking up fingers to the cam. I also got a very close up and personal view of INSIDE pete's mouth. It's amazing, all this technology and Pete sticks it in his cake-'ole! It was great seeing you both and I look forward to seeing you both again (slightly less flesh next time eh!)  If any other Bamber Bunnies or Halston Hoes would like to join in the fun 1) Become a geek 2) Get MSN Messenger 3) Invite ukbackpacker@yahoo.com 4) Have lots of fun exposing bodyparts to Adam in Peru

      Ahh, spent half an hour last night with me and Kat waving frantically down a web cam at Adam currently located in Cuzco, Peru.  Adam refused to engage in audio conversation because he was in a very quiet internet cafe, but the whole thing was very amusing none the less. He looks much the same I can assure you.  And Yes, Kat did moon him.  !P!

      Yeh, this weekand was really nice.  Saturday was down in Richmond, playing "Kubb", in the park with Jo and friends. Then mad dash all the way over to the other side of London to my ex's engagement do and continued dismay at the shitness of the Eurovision Song Contest. But lots of Amarula Annie! Sunday was a BBQ out in the park...  Will add you to Messenger Mnsr Adster, and see if we can't have a chat.  Do any of you other people use any instant messenger thingy? Post your user names on here so I can add you to my "friends"...  Hope you are all well. Looking forward to having back the ones of you coming back and missing the ones who arent/  Hugs  Pete

      'Matthew Wallace, MBE'? Am I the new Elton John of karaoke? Personally, I see myself as more of a Tom Jones...but I'm a publicity whore, so I'll take any label that's going!  Thanks, Annie, got the text, am suffering from lack of funds until end of week so mobile is on receive only! Good luck on the move, will try & phone Friday night (GMT) & catch you before you leave Halston Road forever!  I unfortunately only have Yahoo messenger, not MSN...so I shall have to forgo these conversations and just harass people through comments sections and this blog.  Summer is here for definate - I caught the sun in Brighton and am trying to organise deckchairs & sunloungers for the roof of work - could do with just lazing around...  Au revoir for now!

      Hello All...  If you have MSN Messenger add me, I would love to have some friends (at the moment I have two!).  Then I can see Pete on his web cam and if I find a cafe with webcam you can see meeeeeeee! That would soooo make your day!  my MSN address is ukbackpacker@hotmail.com  Add Adam Add Adam Add Adam... (don't send email to this address as it blocks EVERYTHING and I will never get it).  Annie, I LOVE the idea if AdamAid, perhaps we could hire a karaoke machine and invite very famous singers like Matthew Wallace MBE, and the girl band Katt-nipp (with Katt, Jo, Annie (absent because she is geographically challenged) and Tricky Vicky). I would supply the nibbles and you could kick the shit out of the owner (sorry, I mean, try and negotiate a change of mind)  Also to Annie, BEST OF LUCK with the move mon amie, hope all goes well with the change of city, change of job and the change of status (now 'live-in-luuvver')  It may take a few months to actually kick us out of our family home (only been there 24 years! sob) so if we still have it when I get home, we'll have to have an emergency get together on the farm for all those who can make it at short notice. If not, I am already planning my trips to both our capital city and the capital city of Scotland. I have assumed I can stay at verious households, so I'm coming, like it or not.  Penny is about to drop her sprog, (was her birthday on the 14th) I have told her that as soon as she has little Adam/Adamina she should wheel down to the nearest net cafe and email me and I will let you all know.  I am really looking forward to coming home now. Can't wait to see all the Bamberites and the Halstonites.   I'm ready... are you?  AAPNAC Adam

      The webcam is sitting around waiting for someone to talk to. Never actually used the thing yet. Just sits on top of the computer waiting for something to happen.  Today was the first day I went to work without wearing (that dodgy blue sheepskin) jacket. Summer may be on the way.  Poker night tonight. Will post losses tomorrow.  Have a loverly day everybody.   Oh yeh, this service now has a profiley thingy. Click your name on the right hand side and follow the prompts.  Pete

      Hi all  In Peru, not met Paddingtons family, but I'm sure they are here. Pete doesn't allow me to mess with the page layout, which is a very good thing. I like Pete's new page, very funky, you get two thumbs fresh from me!  Our bus got stopped by masked armed men in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night, very scarey! Actually, it wasn't quite as dramatic as it sounds as it was a picket line (when the Bolivians go on strike they block main roads between towns). A lot of shouting between our driver and the men led to us driving off after about 20 minutes.  Apart from that, still living the high life in South America.  With regard to the trip away, the days of me earning big bucks are over forever, I will be in the same boat as everyone else "HMS Skint" so, what ever we can arrange will be cheap and chearful.  I have some bad news from home. The evil boss who owns our farm looks like he has found a way of getting my parents out, so we may loose it before I get home. I have had an email from my sister that Ang (my step mum) has already started packing and will start onmy room soon. I have to let her know what I want to keep and chuck out. God, I hope she doesn't find the porn!!!  The long and short of it is, we may not have a farm in the west country to visit. Oh well, shit happens.  Hope all is well Love to all human kind (That includes Matt) Out With Hate In With Love Enough of the pleasantries Adam

And all the seriously frantic debauchery is over, I've now moved on to the calmer things - quiet meal with friends tonight, parents tomorrow night, workmates Friday - actually - scotch that 'calmer' point. Plus I'm off to Brighton on Sunday afternoon.  So, all good! Thanks you for all the well-wishes and so forth - my phone is filling up dramatically with texts! So glad I met so many fantastic people on my travels!   See you all soon,  Matt

      Weekend away sounds cool. As long as it's cheap, some of us have to live off the State at the moment!! (Or 'sponge' off you tax payers!!). And I foresee the money in the near future when I do get a job isn't gonna be great to leave me a lot to spend after basic expenses. But I can and will save for a trip somewhere. Unless I get paid a shed load!! But I have another suggestion. When I win the lottery this weekend, I'll buy my own jet and we can all fly off and live on my private island. It's be like the Swiss Family Robinson.....or in our case something like Auckland Family    We'll-Be-Island-on. Where would you lot suggest I buy?  Stu PS can you tell I'm not working and thus bored so making comments like this to pass my time away?!! haha PPS And I'm not spending silly hours on the internet as it isn't 3.23 in the morning like the post suggests!! I need my beauty sleep!!

Anyway bunnies, we are of for a big Taupo trip this weekend, bit of an end of an era really, but there could be up to 17 people coming, so should be entertaining.... and we've got the speed boat this weekend : ) Winter is coming on in NZ, nasty wet and cold at the mo.... However the weather was exceptional in Hakws Bay at the weekend which allowed H and I to Pose in his mums new convertable Audi amongst the vineyards - hard life ay!!!! Miss you all heaps....

      Hello all. Just back from the Galapagos Islands (wow, what a place!!!)and back in good ole (don't cry for me) Argentina. This is the city where I arrived (Buenos Aires) and the city for which I leave for dear old inglaterra, in two weeks. Apart from a few side trips (one being Uraguay) that's it for me! I just want to leave you with this this little story though.... Tonight in my hostel I was quietly reading in the lounge when a guy burst in and said, "come on mate, they got the England game on in the living room". If I had known I would have locked myself in my room, but, not wishing to expalin to a room full of new people that I hate football, I fained interest and watched the game. Then a beer was thrust in my hands, again, not wishing to offend, I forced it down. I ask you, who do they think I am, BEER  AND  FOOTBALL, I'm not one of those outragious hetro's you know!!!  I feel so dirty! PS, That's no way to win a game!

      Hello All,  Inca Trail, Galapogas.... blimey and there was me thinking Te Papa and Cuba Street were exotic!!!  I need to get out more!  Good on ya Adam, hug an iguana for me! Well, looks like I have gone and found myself a proper job... Water Industry Training Adviser... chucked in the company car (up to 3.5L!) in favour of more wonga, and by Charlie you need every cent in this wee backwater we know and love as enzed!  I was finally convinced when I found out the CEO treated everyone to Shrek 2 tickets, and they have a fancy dress do each year - & the company pay for the hire of the outfits!  Meanwhile I have been temping at the Ministry of the Environment - Community Relations Department, which means I am surrounded by journalist stress bunnies and women in comfortable shoes - the rumours are all true about Wellington... Dr Scholl would make a killing in this city!  I must admit working for a 'Ministry' is kinda fun, I even got to go to Parliament on Friday to a big (by NZ standards) Environmental Awards do... paid to drink bubbly all night - marvellous! James and Rebecca have just been staying with us - they fly to the states next week, and Vicky is due to hit town on Tuesday - yay! So life is turning out well in Welly, the gamble seems to be paying off... although H and I have had a few 'intresting' moments!! Hope life is turning out well wherever you are!

      Well, after a few days recovering in Peru I have made it to Ecuador and will fly to the Galapagos tomorrow, which, I must admit, I really excited about. Only thing is my small gamble of hoping Ecuador flight prices were cheaper than Peru, is not true, almost three times as much to get back to Argentina (where my flight home goes from) so I have to do a few sums and it might be cheaper to fly back to Peru and get a flight from there. It's all getting very close now, only a few weeks and I'll be home in the UK. Hope were all ready for another drinky-poos with lickle old me?  ADAM - Ecuador

      I'm back from the Inca Trail, what a utterly fantastic, mind-blowingly beautiful place it is! None of my limbs work now and I think I will walk with a hunch and a limp for the rest of my life, but it was worth it! Walking 5km distance and climbing 1.2km UP from 3000 to 4200 metres above sea level does kinda take the wind out of you, and that was just day two, the last two days I moved extreamly SLOWLY! I have 1.3 billion photos, something for you to look forward to.

      I'm afraid it's true, I mentioned football, albeit in a slightly negitive fashion, and it gets two responses.  I vistited THREE countries today. Started in Argentina, took a bus to Brazil (40 mins, 80p), then walked over the border to Paraguay (tax free shopping BIG TIME). Didn't buy anything though.  :.o(  11 more days and I'll be home.  Tart tart.  Adam  (Adam swings handbag, catches Pete on shoulder)

      No, not football...you just have to hope Pete or I actually surf by whilst bored at work!  Various things happening in the deep south of England - working my proverbial ass off (as opposed to my real one, which just sits there and grows larger). 'Twas Jo's birthday bash on Saturday - Stu & Welchy were down, and we went off to Henley regatta, consuming copious amounts of alcohol whilst laughing at people standing around in ridiculous blazers pretending to be important.  Going to watch Shrek 2 on Wednesday, which promises to be heartily amusing.  Beyond that...I'm not really sure. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest!

       OUTRAGEOUS...  Can you believe that in Buenos Aires Cadburrys produce a nut chocolate bar and a raisin (fruit) chocolate bar, but  NOT  a fruit and nut chocolate bar. I have been forced to buy and eat both at the same time!  UNBELIEVABLE...  In Buenos Aires it is cheaper to by a litre of wine than it is to buy a litre of milk, My cornflakes taste wonderful.

      Hello campers!  Just a we reminder for some important Birthdays coming up.... Mr Peter Ulf Baldwin - (Friday!) 13th August 6 SarumTce, Bow Common Lane, Londinium, E3 4HJ, Blighty Mr Hamish Bevin Coney - (Saturday) 14th August 25 Mortimer Tce, Brooklyn, Wellington, Land of the long white cloud.  All good here in Welly, had a night out on the town with H and some mates from work - found some great bars around the city and drank Mojitos to the health of absent friends! Then swung a taxi door straight into my face and now have a rather fetching cut across my left eyebrow!

      Errmm....  Things in my life:-  I sprained my ankle last Wednesday - am hobbling around feeling sorry for myself (as no-one else will!).  I think I've gotten rid of a stalker. Yes, another one.  I'm up to Bangor at the weekend.  Debs (of the 'naughty nurses' trio) is back in the country soon, and I should be down in Cornwall seeing her at some point.  Jamie is converting his bedroom into a porn palace - even to the extent of having remote control dimmer lights! Donations for a revolving water bed gratefully received....  Not much else going on, too busy working....
