      fuck . .. just FOund these SICK ASS LYRICS from the "non prophets" not to be confused with us... "the bLind Prophets"   chek the method though: sick sick stuff:   Song Title: Tree of Knowledge (from "Untitled Canadian Recordings") Album: Sick of Waiting Written By: Sage Francis   I am a construct of your world. Deep rooted, polluted, tortured/ Abused and altered. I just caught ya'...  Eve's dropping. Adam's rising... To pluck the fruit from off the branch reaching out to touch your inner drive/ Cut me open and count the rings inside to see how long I've been alive/ Containing forms of records about the types of storms I've weathered/ Leave a stump for kids to carve initials as long as I'm remembered/ But lessons go forgotten, plus you don't believe a thing/ Never listening to the whispering of my leaves in the wind/ When the breezes begin, you're just concerned with flying kites/ Until I tangle up your child's play and get you climbing heights/ You're still relucant to hear me out...admiring the sites? You have no idea what it was like being nailed to Christ.   You're swinging from the twigs and limbs they used to hang your siblings/ have respect you selfish, self-centered, sack of manmade buildings/ I was the original pinnacle, but now I'm nothing to you but kindling?/ Tickling inhibitions, I'm naturally attracting children/ Who have a funny idea of what "4-eva" is/ I witnessed the first time lips kissed with stripped innocence/ Not too long after that...was I supplying shade/ For a man caressing silverbacks...trying to get laid/ Monkeying around and now they're all dying of AIDS/ Government guerilla tactics? That's a farce. I bring the plagues. Cancer? thats just icing on the cake I nurse and feed ya'/ Because you drained me of my sap with taps of perversed procedure/ I hold your family background right down to the first ameoba/ Watched you grow from just crustacean to a land mammal. It hurts to leave ya'/ But I've had enough. And it'll be very relieving/ Just who do you think supplies the air you're breathing?/ Humongous oxygen tanks? As if its all free? Wondering where your dogs are at? They're barking up the wrong tree/ Wanting proof of identification, but I existed before fingerprints/ Cognitive Dissonance. I hear chain saws in the distance/ "if a tree falls in the forest and nobody's there to hear it/ Does it make a sound?" I'll go down quietly...but you'll feel it/ Still these six-legged thoughts keep eating away at my inside/ Until I'm nothing but hollowed out hide.   The dead tree is still standing.   Here comes the hunting axe of lumberjacks who I attract like lightning when the thunder cracks. I can't run from the facts. I'm under attack. I see...nothing but black. Finally...I slumber and relax

      if i ever die, or rather, when i die...remember these two writings as my last piece of work.  the 8th deadly sin...  to misunderstand is the crime of all crimes..the 8th deadly sin, the unquestionably determining factor in those who shall eventually succeed in most matters and those who shall fail...to question is to be prevalent in all areas...to foreshadow thy doubts and instinctively overcome them through a series of intuitive influxes of curiousity....to overwhelm thine own anxiety througha  matter of phases, each phase collectively gathering and pushing forward this sudden thrust of a desire to learn....this desire growing until it reaches a point at where it is no longer a desire but rather a need...a need to know...the thirst for knowledge grows inevitable through my days...a mere witness i stand, yet a witness whose keen and intelligent observations shall one day haunt those who forever would ridicule...those who consider themselves elite will forever feel sorrow within their hearts....this sorrow for themselves, regretful of all the remarks they made to those who were merely witnesses...         FROM THE roots of misunderstanding spreads ignorance, whose poisonous branches emerge from deep within the soil of hatred...having seeped into the tree of hate itself, the oxygen released shall affect each and every individual who unsuspectingly yet willingly breathes the toxic fumes...and one by one, the apocalypse known as mass ignorance and utter invalidity of the functional mind spreads and spreads until the soul of men has been corrupted with the dirt of gluttony itself...until one of the 7 deadly sins has overcome an imposter...a sin unworthy of the mighty seven, yet devastatingly blood ridden, thriving on the evil that lurks within...within us all.    LOVE  the pressure mounts within, steadily agitating the blood that bubbles within the veigns of my hands.  holding her in my arms, a sense of accomplishment fills the airs, provoking mixed feelings of pride and emotion ridden work, all gone into that one perfect moment...words of love depart my mouth, journeying into the precious ears of hers....always attentive, always listening.  foresaken in the second, she looks away, and i find myself at unease, unable to identify her reason of "disinterest"...yet...misunderstood I sit, waiting, until in that same motion, our lips move toward each other.      if love could ever talk, then its relentless singing rang constant throughout our minds, and within our hearts...problems forgotten, worries banished, and emotions climaxed...it was at that moment that we had become the vital beats to the rythm known as true love...it was at that moment that the world was in my arms...that the feelings that grew deep within my heart, molded themselves into the rarest thing on earth...true love.

      something i wrote last night...chek em  "fuck man, lemme start off by listing everything thats runnin through my mind...  1.) court date on tuesday...180 dollar fine = more work  one person called me to wish me good luck...of all the people, especially, i thought someone else would care enough to call...but i guess sometimes we hope for too much eh?  good lookin out ranbir.  2.) i see Noor 2 times a fucking month...which is unbelievably frustrating...most of our relationship is developed over the gay ass phone...i hate the phone...base root of the word relationship is relation...relation = how one person relates to another person...HOW THE FUCK CAN I RELATE WHEN I see her twice  a fucking month??    3.) what the fuck is the point of me working, if the money i earn is only used for gifts for my girl, yet i see her once a fucking blue moon.theres no point in me working...i don't want money...i want her  4.) phil & paige are done...for good...now wut the fuck does that tell me? they got to see each other every day.  its like i'm dating the phone..or perhaps just a voice...and every so often theres a person.  ..i mean , seriously , wut the fuck??  5.) i'm getting a lotta shit about the ticket...the stupid shit is gonna stay on my record for five years...definetely fucked myself over.  6.) my report card'z about to come anyday now...which equals more fucking myself over...  7.)  this is not how i planned to spend my summer.  8) i cried last nite.  i dont remember the last time i cried before that.  i dont know wut im doing....and i dont think anybody else does either....  9) my momz dont like noor or her family, but loves iisha and her family...now wut in the fuck is this bullshit??  noor is my girl for life...actually, nah fuck that  noor is my life. better put...  so fuck off.  10.) times i've seen noor:   - new years party  - bhangra comp. @ csun  - gdwara  - bruin bhangra  - sat 2 @ reseda  - grad @ reseda  6 times...3 times since we've been together  wow.  wut a fucking relationship.    dont push me fuckers  im on the edge  and i'ma fuck somebody up before i leave.  fuck wut you heard"   - dead

He knew something was wrong from the words they had lacked, He stopped and parked by a railroad track. Finally she said "My parents said we cannot be." He took out a piece of paper and began to write, Then he said "Read it tonight" All of a sudden he was drowned in fears, He bit his lip to fight his tears. Within a few seconds the metal collided. The last thing she remembered was blood running red, And someone saying "Sorry hes dead" She reached into her pocket and took out the note, And stared sadly at the message he wrote Her eyes started burning and started to cry, The note simply read "Without you i would die..."  i like a lot, when love is so deep, its amazing/ =) *partially the reason why i watch very old indian movies*...

      this life ain't be too easy...growin up n all.  i've dealt with a lotta shit...ask anyone, from gabriel, my boy from san jose elementary, to my boys alex, matt, and ben from reed, to my family at granada, matt, osama, phil...  but i'm here now. still breathing. still alive.  no thanks to the man above...if he had his way, i'd be long gone...i mean, i'm not even supposed to be alive rite now...  i've been flirting with death ever since god stole caroline.  something happened a few days ago that has made me re-examine the way i act, the way i keep myself in check.  i've been broken, tortured, but not beaten.  i have yet to be beaten.   i pray for you noor...i pray that everyday, you wake up with a tender smile on your face...that your bruises humble your soul...that you may be strong enough to face whatever abuse your father dishes out.  i pray for you noor. phil prays for you. matt prays for you. osama prays for you.  the blind prophets pray for you. my brother prays for you. scott prays for you. preeti prays for you. jessica prays for you. even iisha, more than anyone else except me, prays for you.  i am here for you. my eyes grow teary as i write these words.  i am here. always.      helpless we may stand...but we will get through this.  you will get through this...  yeh...i've been broken...you don't understand how much it takes for me to break down and cry.  the last time was when i couldn't see you and it felt like forever.  the time before that was in 6th grade after someone told me that cuz of my looks, i wouldn't amount to shit.  the next time someone said that, i left em' without their teeth.       i love you to death...and you may not know for the next 2 years...but you will find out...i promise  and i have yet to break a promise to you.  this i promise you...that you'll always be mine. no one else can ever come close to where you have been placed in my heart.  NO ONE.   these words are meaningless without feeling...and i put all my feeling into this...  i cry as i speak to you...  i beg mercy from satan...to leave us alone. please ...god please let us be.   just me and her.    just let us be.  be my wife noor. be my everything. you ARE my everything.  you are me. i am you.  WE ARE ONE.

      Our highly qualified staff will connect you to machines that maintain blood flow and oxygen levels. This prevents the brain from dying while your body is cooled to a point at which it no longer requires oxygen. Your blood is then replaced with a liquid preservative designed specifically to support life at low temperature. Once this process is complete, your body is immersed in silicone oil and lowered to -79°C. We then transfer you to a liquid nitrogen-filled chamber for further cooling. Over the next two weeks, you are lowered to a temperature of -196°C. You will then be ready for long-term storage. You will remain frozen until science has achieved complete control over biological processes. At that time, you will be thawed and your ailments treated. You will have a fresh lease on life, in a new, more advanced world where aging has been abolished. We’ll wrap your body in a woolen shroud without any embalming fluids. You will be buried in a place on the forest floor that you have chosen. Your family may want to perform a ceremony there. You can be buried in a casket if you like, but it must be made of wood, wicker, or bamboo. Ultimately, everything must decompose, so if you do choose to have a casket, it can’t contain any metal or other non-biodegradable material. Once your body is laid down in the earth, the displaced dirt is filled in and the topsoil is replaced. You can mark the grave with an inconspicuous, discreet wood carving instead of a headstone or plastic flowers. Over time, the carving will return to the soil just like your body. You can also plant your favorite tree over the grave. That way, your remains will provide nourishment for the growing sapling, and you will feed new life.   - havok

"you need to make some major changes in your thought process, in your style...so you stop acting like a shameless piece of shit."   - my mom..she just called rite now to tell me that. the love is immense, ain't it?            wow...how i fucked up.  i feel sick in my stomach  shit man, my ankle is killing me.  a simple existence, is what i shall seek/ and with that, i'll always know that my life is complete//  whoever wrote that bullshit...
