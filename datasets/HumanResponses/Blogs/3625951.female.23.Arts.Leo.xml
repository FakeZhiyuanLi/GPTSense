      Yes, that's right I am finally back in WA. I am safe and sound, and tired. I want so badly to run around and paint the town, but I haven't the energy to do so. I'm hoping to in a few days, but the three days on the road just drained me emotionally and physically. I have a lot to do now that I am back in town. I have to get my car back, and a place for my cat to live as well, poor thing is living in a trailer all by himself. Just got back from seeing Spiderman. It was pretty awesome. Not sure what I'm doing the next few days, but I'm be around. Hopefully soon I'll have the computer set up so I can write more often, until then I will be absent, but not lost. I will be setting up Hello soon, so I can also put pictures of me up, but not until I get my computer up and running, which will take a while since we are living in a hotel right now. I'm just glade to be home. Peace.

      Do I have to have a web cam to post pic's? I was looking into Hello, but I don't know if I want to do that. Is there any other way?

      The day after Fahrenheit 9/11, I really didn't know what to expect. I strongly encourage anyone who is for Bush to see this movie. I watch the news, just like everyone else does, but they don't tell you everything, they only try to put the fear in us, so we won't ask questions. We are being controlled, well, not all of us, but most of us. It's amazing, the way things are, I don't understand them much myself, all I can do is try to make a difference. I'm actually concerned 'bout who is in control now that I've seen what one man can do. I've already signed up to become a registered voter. I can vote now, my voice matters. And I plan on voting for the other guy.

      Yes that's right I am on my way back to Wa. I leave sometime in the next few days. Haven't decided when yet. We'll probably leave Sunday, then arrive Tuesday. I can't wait to see my family. I've missed everyone so much, and I get to see my cat, whom I miss the most. So wish me well on my trip I will right again when I arrive.

      I think I finally figured this shit out, what a pain in the ass. If this works I'm done for the night, I have some real things to attend to.

      Well I have started going out looking for work now. There are a lot of jobs out here, I just need to go out and get one. So, yesterday I went to a interview, at Top foods. I don't know if I'll get the job or not. Today I'm just trying to get my costume together for the Ren fair. It's coming up quick and I haven't finished my shirt yet. This project has proven to be harder than I thought. Thankfully I have my mom who knows what she's doing to help out.  I'm all alone today, my boy is at work, mom and dad our out all day. So, it's just me........I picked up a book the other day, so I think I'll read a little, sew a little, maybe I could get some meditating in today.

      it seems like everything that i want to do today is getting held back by something. i was going to get my license back today, but i can't get anyone on the phone that can help me right now. then i started working on my costume for the ren fair this year, and i totally got too depressed to want to finish. i think i need to go out for a walk or something, clear my head. this place is bringing me down. i also need to get my resume back together, but i have no motivation what so ever, like always. i don't know what to&nbsp;do. &nbsp;

      Finally, a place I can call home. We've settled in the apartment with my parents, and as soon as my grandma moves out we will have our own room. I can't wait. I think I will finally be motivated to get a job now. It's been so hard lately, I'm just getting over a cold, and we've been staying in hotels, while Ben is at work all day I haven't much time to get out and look for a job. I don't have my car or my license, and I won't have those for a while. Now that we're staying here though I think I will be better motivated to get a job. I'm just going to have to suck it up and take the bus again. It's not that bad. I just don't know where I will find a job. I also want to go back to school asap. Besides that I'm usually wasting time playing EQ. I'm suck a nerd. Well, my boy should be home soon and we're all going out to see I' ROBOT. I can't wait.

      I hate being sick! I had to wake up before noon to move out of the hotel we were staying at, now we are going to be staying in a nicer one, one without ants. I had to move my cat out too, 'cause he was staying there with us. He scratched the hell out of my shoulder. It hasn't been a very fun day. Now we are looking for a place to rent with my parents. They are ok with us having our own room if we are paying half the rent. So, it will be ok for a while. I still need to find a job though. As soon as I stop being sick I will begin my search. There are so many things that I don't want to do for work right now, so I'm being kind of picky. Anyway, that's pretty much it right now. Things are crazy like usual, I'll be in touch.

      So, I'm going back and forth from Hotel to my parents apartment, just to check my mail, and keep in touch with my life a little. How is everything out there in cyberland? Sometimes I wish I could just jump into the computer and stay there for a while, I'll come out when everything is how it should be. Who's watching the fire works show tonight? Or will you be making some of your own? I haven't decided which way I will go tonight. I'd rather just hide away for a while, not really in the mood to be out with people and the action. I finally have been reunited with my cat. He's staying at the Hotel with me, he just hides under the covers all day, until he's hungry. He slept at my feet all night, and licked my toes in the morning. There is something comforting 'bout having my cat with me again. Well, whatever you do tonight, be safe. I'll be around.
