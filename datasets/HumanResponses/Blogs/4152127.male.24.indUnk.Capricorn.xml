      Whoa...it's something that the people don't really expect that things can happen by itself.  I am not really scared of that because I am really getting used to it 5-6 times before.  Here what happened.  When I was on the way to the city where I was supposed to help by work cleaning the house with someone, until something went over my head and things did happened really unexpectedly to me.  When I drove through the freeway and about to changed the lane to other after checked on my side of pickup.  Suddenly, I noticed that the truck in front of me was stopped very soon and I cannot expect it to do that and stomped on the brake but it's too late for that.  My pickup's front left corner already smashed on the truck's back right corner.  The other truck have lil damage but mine was worst.  I saw the smoke came out and the antifreeze liquid leaked all over the road.   I was like frozen and said "damn..." in my mind.  My mouth exhaled and inhales outside and inside slowly.  You know the route for the car wreck like reporting the police department, write down on other person's driver liscense and car insurance, signed on the wreck report paper down, and so on the list.  The state trooper gave me the ticket for getting close to the vehicle that worth $171.   Big ouch for me.  Later, the state trooper (st) and me had a chat while we were on the way to drop me off because my dad can picked me up.   Here what happened is:  We chatted by wrote on the paper back and forth.  Me and State trooper talked about new police radar that have video camera, police speed radar, etc until the special conversation came up.  ST:  How old are you? Me:  24 ST:  Do you work? Me: No, I have been looking for a job since I graduated from university because the jobs are getting harder and harder to find these days. The state trooper nodded in agreement. ST: Do you ever had a ticket before? Me:  Honestly, yes.  But I hadn't had one for long time until now because I had been drove very carefully. He nodded again. Me:  But sometime things can happens unexpectedly to anyone. He went hmm and wrote down on the paper ST:  Give me the ticket I went look for it and gave it to him then I was puzzled about that and read what he said to me without write down on the paper. He said "Don't worry about that and I will take care of that." I was shocked and surprised then write down on the paper Me:  Thank you very much and I am very appreciate with that. I did shook the hand with him and thanked him.  See what I mean?  I am very lucky enough to getting out of the $171-worth ticket for being honest with the state trooper and did learned the big valuable lesson for telling nothing but truth to the state troopers.  Sometime the unlucky situation can lead to the lucky day.  That's all I have the news for now.

      It has been awhile since I have been updated my blog because I had been busy lately especially had gone to Texas for a weekend.  On Friday, I drove all the way to Fort Worth from my home for little bits over three hours to visit my friend Sam for fun and enjoyed the time. I did have little bits lots around Fort Worth until I figured out a way to getting there. Geeezum, the area of Fort Worth did sure confuse me somewhat. Anyways, Sam and me went out to eat at Denny's for dinner since we got hungry and then came to his place to chat then went to downtown of Fort Worth to check around especially Star Buck’s where Sam host over for Deaf Coffee Chat on every third Friday of each month. I admit that that place is pretty big than other Star Buck’s that I know of and walk outside around. Now we get back to Sam's place for get a rest and watch the movie "Kill Bill Volume 2". It's ehhh...alright but too much talk.  On Saturday, Sam and I really had a blast time to go to Six Flags in Arlington when Deaf Awareness Day was and took the advantage of it especially the cost of entry fee which saved me a twenty-buck discount from the normal forty-five-dollars-worth entry fee. And have a good time with Candy, Kendra and other friends until Six Flags was about to closing for a night...I mean a GREAT time for all day and all evening. Oh boy....our feet already got sore but I don't know about other friends' feet. Ha-ha...I did take the pictures with my digita camera.  Then Sam and me got back to home....for finally got some rest, ate some dinner from Sonic’s Drive-Thru, and watch some stupid but funny movie (I don't remember what it called, sorry.)  On Sunday, we toured around Fort Worth little bits and tell me about places such as Texas Christian University, and comic store/Game Stop. Now I was ready to leave back to my home for around three and half hours and after that, I worn out like heck. I got to deserve the whole day off to rest.

      There is a place that has an opening job for Guest Representative Customer at Hollywood Video Store that I went there for applying for that position then do it once again on the website few days later. Recently, I went to that same store and asked the store director about the position if she had got anything from me lately. I found out that she didn't get anything from me for some weird reason and I might be denied by Hollywood Video because my score from the online application probably proved bad. If it did happen, then I get pissed off and would dislike to being denied by anyone for no reason. I am in desperate for a job so badly as well as most of people that I knew do.  Now, my internet connection got weird and got a problem with DNS because I can't seem to able to access into some of the web sites but can access into other web sites. Arrrgh, stupid internet service has a DNS problem or whatever it called so.  What a fucked-up day for me.

      When I finally got back to my home from the long weekend, then I fell collapsed and check on the computer to see if I have any new messages and emails for me to read. It turned out that I have some unread ones that I had to catch up with. Oh boy...It took me around an hour to done that.  I am really looking forward to get some nap right away. Have a good evening!

      Yesterday, I went to North Dallas for Deaf Coffee Social at Starbuck and have a good time to chat with people that I know from there. Even if it's a three-hour long road trip for me.  When I finally arrived to North Dallas pretty earlier than two hours, I have plenty of time to do when I want to take a rest. While I went to Borders Book, Music & Cafe for reading the comic books that I haven't read before yet. I have done that even if I was still rest. I am surprised that the time really flew when I read the books. I realized that I have less than an hour till Starbuck social time. I felt so hungry and found the fast food that I haven't try before. It's Whataburger. Never heard of it before? I haven't seen it before in my home state and went there to eat it. It's not that bad but the meal that I ordered was pretty big than what I had expected that.  Afterward, I went to Starbuck and realized that it's only less than 30 minutes until then. I was bored and walked outside around Starbuck once until I saw someone signed and joined up with them for conversation. Finally Candy and Kendra showed up that I chatted with...Later Sam showed up unexpectedly because I thought that he told me that he would probably not make it to there....now he did made it there. It caught my attention too. All of us kept chatted as more people showed up there. It's pretty much crowded there.  Until then, the crowd gets smaller and smaller as the night arrived. After Sam, and the girls start to leave to home. I was on the way back to my home state as well as but I was going to the hospital for checked out on someone there. And I slept in the waiting room there. What an exhaust night for me. Zzz....  That's all I have for now.

      Welcome to my first-time so-called newly blog side. I figured out about why not have my own blog for you to catch up with the news about myself lately.  So, I don't have very much things to say right now since I am kind of getting sleepy at this moment. Well, th-th-th-th-that's all, folks!
