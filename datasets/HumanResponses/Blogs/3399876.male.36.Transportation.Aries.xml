      Where do I start? What's it all about? What am I doing here? When's the next REAL drink destined to pass these arid lips?  All simple questions really, but where are the real answers? The only one I can respond to honestly is the last - 09:45 Thursday the 27th May (champagne cocktail or Vodka Martini - decisions, decisions........) soaring above the Kuwaiti desert en route to yet another well deserved LWOP in the oasis that is modern Dubai! Emirates serve a mean Martini and after weeks of State imposed sobriety the first, in all honesty even a piss poor imitation, flows past the epiglotis to slake the thirst and revive the underused internal organs that have to all intents and purposes forgotten their primary function.  (Lengthy pause while figuring out what the hell I'm trying to do here)  Ah, that's better, getting to grip with this thing.  My idea for this blog is to compile 18 years of memoirs in war zones, humanitarian disaster areas (along with the odd stint in a Zairois jail) and gauge whether there are any other wayward individuals out there who have done nothing but drift from disaster to disaster. If there aren't, then at least my typing skills will be finely tuned (more than the pathetic one finger technique currently used) and I'll have vented my frustration with the world at large.  A note here dear reader, this blog is intended to be more a tongue in cheek, humorous look at some of the aspects of life in the dust bowl!   Anyway, enough of this frivolity, it's late, I'm tired and the Muezzin's call is not too far away - More tomorrow.   urlLink

      Friday - the start of the weekend. Bacchanalian frivolity (ok, drunken tomfoolery), nightclubs, doner kebabs, praying to the great god porcelain............ all those things that those of you in the real world take for granted. Here? Oh, it's just another Monday, 12 hours work, 2 hours travel, an hour to eat, slump in front of the telly, pass out - wake up with a crick in the neck, stagger to bed and then........... wake up and repeat! I sometimes wonder what leading a real life would entail. I'll let you know if I ever get to lead one!  On a serious note, attended a memorial service today for 16 colleagues who have paid the ultimate price for working in this AO. A brutal reminder of the dangers faced by those of us that trawl the world's hot spots in search of work. I knew two of the deceased well and although they have gone in body, their spirit lives on.

      Isn't it strange how we all have a tendency to wish away our lives when anticipating something good and try to postpone the inevitable bad? Well, as the title suggests, the LWOP (leave without pay) looms in the not too distant future and I CAN'T WAIT! Four nights of good food and fine wine followed by chronic hangovers! BLISS!

      Ahhhhhhhhhhh, day off, lie in, leisurely breakfast, soak in the bath, sunbathe by the pool, bit of surfing, jetski...................Oh how wrong can you be? Wake up 05:30, rushed croissant, constant phone calls, pick up ticket, hurried shopping, prepare dinner.....................this is NOT fun! So is this what I can expect when my career path changes and I start a 5 1/2 day week? Then you can keep it --------- well for the time being anyway.  Have received some e-mails from old colleagues and have been musing over the past. Parties in Bukavu, jail in Kinshasa (reminder: must get with Tony and pen his view of our incarceration), trips through the Khyber pass, incredibly expensive tea in Peshawar, under attack in Somalia, Stock in Sarajevo (Stock: one of those drinks that go down a treat at the time - but soon regretted by the severity of the hangover),Cruising off Croatia....................... I couldn't make most of this stuff up if I tried.  New hobby for 2004 is learning to play the guitar - will keep you posted!

      Too busy to pen much today. Currently reading a plethora of pulp fiction - dismal. Sun # 1 has yet to sign in on Messenger - I'll give him another hour or so then retire! The NA beer is merely making me bloated. Had a brainstorm - might buy a property in South Africa if Dubai deal goes to ratshit. Tallied the promotion board figures today - at least four individuals will start next week better off!

      My dear friend and erstwhile colleague Al Kat (I'll collect the money later) posed the following question:  "Are the questions of the type “what is the purpose of my life” only the voice of the thirst or are you aiming at finding the answers through writing? Has this perpetual risk-taking been worth it?"   Well, dear readers, the answer is....................NO IDEA! I have often contemplated penning my thoughts in a public forum (secretly relishing the criticism and notoriety) and have only recently plucked up the courage to do so. Admittedly the thirst and quenching thereof late at night helps the creative juices flow. I do believe that the perpetual risk taking has been worth it - if for no other reason for the friendships that I have developed with some very humble 'heroes'. Will I find myself through this medium? We'll have to see.................Anyhow, the plane leaves in 13 hours 14 minutes (not that I'm counting!!!!). Will send epistles from the Emirates.

      Being a nosy sod, at times,(must recap on my grammar here (i.e. when to use commas etc)) I surf the web and merely search for names from the past. Isn't it worrying what you can find on the web? Anyhow, I was sitting with a large Gin and Tonic and decided to do a search on those individuals that had enjoyed the same scholastic upbringing as myself and stumbled along the writings of David Bennun. David and I had numerous run-ins at school and were forever the bane of Miss McKechnie's (English teacher at Hillcrest) life. Wiping the tears of mirth from my face, the memories came flooding back - in the interest of  the living, I shall not divulge the names of those involved in any of the incidents I remember so well. A book well worth shelling out a few quid for! Dave, when's the next one out?

      Well, what can I say about LWOP? - don't know really, have pretty much slept through it. Nights evolve into days etc. However, have had a few interesting conversations with my sometime mentor, DD, (Double Diamond is not his favourite beverage (that particular privilege being Bud in a bottle - rule #1))who is now enjoying life in the metropolis that is modern Amman.  What makes us stay in jobs that demand 12 hour shifts, 7 days a week? The answer, dear readers, is greed. Since when does an 8 hour day off necessitate working 12 merely for the 4 hours extra?????? When does a 4 day LWOP mean losing money? - after all you can't lose what you don't have. These questions plague me (I bugger off as often as possible and a day off? Shangri La!), is it a them and us syndrome? Excuse me dear reader, I may have yet to mention that I work within a company that is 90% American and 10% rest of the world. Still, it's back to work tomorrow for the Yankee dollar and........GOD BLESS AMERICA!

      As much as I tried to refrain from taking my seat on the flight back, I was eventually strapped down, manacled and kept at bay for the one and a half hour flight back to Kuwait. Therefore, once I regain my composure and my internal organs stop yelling at me for more of the same (Ice cold Strongbow), I shall get down to some serious scribbling tomorrow. To make this more interesting, I throw out this challenge - send me a topic and I'll endeavour to write something appropriate - Go on, you know it makes NO sense!

      I have worked alongside many MSF volunteers and I would like to pay tribute to the 5 members of the MSF team that lost their lives doing what I and many others have done for many years - brought hope and relief to the many that have been persecuted and had their lives made miserable through so many futile wars. Although you are gone, your spiirits live among the humanitarian community! May God Rest Your Souls in Eternal Peace

      Just as I thought I had settled back in to the routine - CRISIS! Have to travel to Blighty for a few tests - still the weather is improving I am reliably informed. Am taking the graveyard flight via DXB, 5 hours retail therapy in the airport shoud keep me occupied. More soon..............................

      Back Again............ Having great difficulties in communicating with the Insurance and Medical professions!!! I've paid diligently my dues - why should there be a problem when I need to cash in? Anyway, the weather in London has been kind, perhaps too kind to the jungle that has erupted in the back garden, reminds me - call the gardener. I have promised to write lengthier tomes to this blog - I will do, I PROMISE!

      Only eight hours to go before my fate will be sealed. For some obscure reason all other ailments now rearing their ugly heads in sympathy - rheumatism (or is it gout due to the red wine, red meat, lots of fat diet of the past week), cold flu like symptoms etc.. But where is the hangover???? Keeping sober - will report later!

      Well, the preliminary results are in and the clock is ticking. The consultant is confident that all will be well within a few days and that I should be back to work in a short while - Yeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaa! Okay, that was a bit too Texan, but I am keen to get back to work and regroup with my incredible team in Kuwait.   We did a little test prior to my departure a couple of weeks ago with regard to cultural diversity and sensitivity. Within my team, we have a total of 19 different languages spoken!!! Thus, everyday, we learn 5 different phrases per tongue. Dependant on the length of the contract, we could all be proficient in enough languages for all of us to be able to negotiate for taxi fares worldwide at airports without being ripped off!!!!!!!

      Oh well, all good (bad?) things come to an end and I have finally been contacted by travel acknowledging that I will be contacted re: my return to the dusty desert of Kuwait and gainful employ. Why contact someone to tell them they will be contacted??? Anyway, now the farewells and last minute shopping have to kick in full speed. What clothes to take back? What did I really miss last sojourn? Will I need Andrews Liver Salts? (highly doubtful) Do I need to pack spices? (for those doubting Thomases, I cook a mean curry and have a kitchen that needs TLC every now and again) Did I miss anyone out on the kitschy (is that a word?) London souvenirs that all my non-British friends expect? AAAAAAAAaaaagh the list is endless. Maybe I'll just turn up and state that my gift is MY RETURN!!!!!!  The last few weeks have been exhausting (read expensive)! I have, however met some old school friends from twenty years ago - David and Pascal ( a very liquid evening - thanks to Kenya Breweries and n particular brother Tusker!) I intend now to keep in touch with those who played a major part in my past. The conversation was riveting, if not at times embarrassing - I went out with who????????  Oh well, as I prepare to return to the fold, I shall return to daily blogging - my holiday is over!!!!!!! Today I was wished the following by an old friend, a true alternative to Bon Voyage.  SAFARI NJEMA

      It is with great sadness that I learnt of the tragic helicopter accident in Sierra Leone of the UN Mi 8 aircraft and the loss of 24 lives. I have travelled extensively in UN aircraft and had the unfortunate experience of being an Air Ops Duty Officer when two of their aircraft were 'lost' due to hostile action. The pilots and staff of the UN do a magnificent job in the world's most hostile environments - it's just a shame that the media coverage (ticker tape on ITV news on cable)does not do their efforts justice. Or maybe, it's just that Sierra Leone is now passe?

      Been off the web for a while due to a multitude of reasons – main one being erratic communications. Now settling in (well, if you call sleeping in a small room with loads of other farting and snoring males settling in) in the metropolis we call Umm Qasr port. It’s very quiet here – barring the sounds described above. I feel refreshed and eager to settle into my new role. Life support is very basic and it can only get better – why is it that on every contract they say the same!!!?????!!  My new colleagues are a mixed bunch (ex Foreign Legionnaire, Hawaiian oarsman…….. you get the picture) and friendly to boot! The local workforce are keen…………………..  Do I regret the change? No. Will I regret it? I certainly hope not!! The beer is cold and plentiful…………………..Bliss
