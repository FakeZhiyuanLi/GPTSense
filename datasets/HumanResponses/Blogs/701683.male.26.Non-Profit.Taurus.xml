        Read 1 Timothy 4:12    Can there be a better way to start off a webpage for youth than with one of the most powerful scripture passages for youth???  I think not! :)  Paul was writing Timothy (who was most likely a teen!), encouraging him to do TWO main things:  1.  To not let anyone (the old folk) look down on him because he was young, and                     2.  To be an example to all those around him by the way he talked, the way he lived, the way he loved, what he believed,                      and the way he lived morally.    So does it sound like a piece of cake to do?  Or does it sound impossible or crazy?  Personally, I know that when I was in high school, I thought that this was nothing but wishful thinking.  Because how was I supposed to get the grown-ups to look up to me???  It wasn't recently until it hit me--Part 1 of the verse happens BY LIVING OUT THE SECOND PART OF THE VERSE!  By setting and example   in speech, in life, in love, in faith, and in purity.    So let me encourage you to be that example that Paul calls us to be!  You can do it!  Peace...

      Testing. Testing.  One, two, three.  Is this on?  Ok, I think it is....:).    Hola peeps!!!    To the youth of St. Alban's in Waco, my friends, co-workers, my family in beautiful Virginia, and the random wanderer--WELCOME to the Youth Advance, where you can come for daily thoughts, scripture verses, prayer requests, and more!  Here's another way to look at it:      Come get your daily fuel!!    ...a chance for perhaps a little inspiration and direction.  This is your friend and brother Aaron here...I hope this is of service to ya'!  It's my prayer that this blog is used to the glory of God!  So let's begin the glimpse....

      "Holy Fire"  Holy Fire from heaven Descend to us we pray Let us burn again Holy Fire from heaven Consume our hearts today Let us burn again...let us burn again   All my peeps in the house raise their hand if they're familiar with the phrase, "On fire for God"....ah yes, by the looks of it there's a good number of you who have heard it or used it before.  (Forgive my imagination...I've had some late late, sleep-deprived nights watching the biggest sporting event in the world...the World Cup baby!!) :)  Anyways, it is pretty safe to say that most Christians have heard that phrase used.  You come home from a camp or retreat where you feel as if God has spoken to you and you make a commitment to Him...that you wont' let the fire He lit in you die out.  Or you've been on a mission trip and have been so moved by witnessing the power of Christ firsthand, that its as if you've been set ablaze for him.  I know I've used it plenty of times personally...what about you?  Contact me and let me know your take on it.   In my previous entry, I talked about how easy it is to feel all parched, weak, and in need of nourishment from God.  Jesus talks about and the Psalms describe God as a good shepherd who leads his flock to "quiet waters", out of danger, and into "green pastures" (Psalm 23).  When the prophet Elijah was running for his life...he eventually collapsed in exhaustion and was on the verge of death, and God came and fed him and nourished him.(1 Kings 19)  After fasting for 40 days and being constantly tempted by the devil, Matthew 4 tells us that Jesus was immediately attended to and taken care of by angels.  It seems like its when we're the most weak or dead on the inside that God comes to us to nourish us, or in other words, put a spark in us.  The thing about a spark or a small flame is that its potential is unending.  However, it is really easy to put out while its still small.  Think about how hard it is to keep a match lit when it is windy or wet!  So when God gives us that spark on the inside, its up to us to enable it to grow...and not only enable it to grow, but to let it spread!  Forest fires are, at times, impossible to stop b/c of their fury, strength, and size...however, they usually are started by a single flame or spark that can often be extinguished by a little water.    Many of you will go away to camps or mission trips this summer and come back changed....  on fire  .  If you're not careful, that spark or flame can be put out as soon as you return home....but let me encourage you to fan into that flame so that it'll grow into a beautiful and powerful blaze!  Remember, it needs to grow (through prayer, Bible study, etc.) and it needs to spread (to other people)...that way it will never go out!  Finally, you don't have to wait for a camp or mission trip to catch fire!  Pray the words of the song at the beginning of this entry:   Holy Fire from heaven Descend to us we pray Let us burn again Holy Fire from heaven Consume our hearts today Let us burn again...let us burn again    Matthew 7:7-8, "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and door will be opened to you.   For everyone who asks receives... " So ask God for it in holy expectancy...for His Holy Fire from heaven will come and consume your heart  today ....ask Him.  Ask Him.

      Ever since moving to Texas, I've learned to really appreciate the value of a nice cool glass of water...or even better, Bush's Sweet Tea!! Mmmmmmmmmmmm.  The heat and dryness around here literally sucks the moisture from your mouth so that you quickly get parched, especially if you're outside in the sun.    That's just how life is too isn't it.  The energy and joy we have often gets drained by trials and troubles of life--hurt friendships, loss of family, arguments, stress, busy-ness etc.  It makes us tired, drained, and thirsty for a revived spirit.  Personally, I've gone through that a lot lately...the stresses of moving and packing, exhaustion, and missing my family has really taken its toll on me the past few weeks.  But the Lord has led me to the "quiet waters" of Psalm 23.  Notice how He not only leads us to the waters to quench our thirst...but he leads us to  quiet  waters so that we can drink in peace and safety.  :) Such an encouragement.  Thirsty?  I pray that you seek the arms of God so that He can lead you to those waters.  Let me leave you with the words of a song that has sustained me of late:   All who are thirsty All who are weak Come to the fountain Dip your heart in the stream of life Let the pain and the sorrow Be washed away In the waves of His mercy As deep cries out to deep  Come Lord Jesus come...Holy Spirit come.   Amen.

      Whenever I'm reading the Bible, my number one most favorite thing to do is  to imagine.   I know, I know...sounds kinda' weird, or nerdy, or just plain dumb.  It probably has something to do with the fact that my dad's an English teacher, so I grew up appreciating reading and stretching my mind....so yea, I guess it does have something to do with being a part-time nerd!    But on the other hand, I think it has to do mostly with the fact that I've recently come to realize and appreciate the fact that its God who has given us our imagination.  The same Almighty God who flung the stars into the sky, rolled the earth into existence, and breathed life into every being here took the time to instill in us an imagination.  With God, there are no accidents.  Everything He puts into action has a purpose!  So if He's given it to us, I think you would agree its pretty clear what we're to do with it....USE IT!! :)  So like I said earlier, I like to use my imagination whenever I'm reading stories in the Bible...and I encourage you to do the same!  Try to look deeper into it than what the scriptures provide.  Let me give you one such example:  I was reading Luke 5:17-26 today...go ahead and read it.  I'll wait for ya'.  Done?  Ok, good.  As you know from reading it, its the story about Jesus healing the paralytic man who was lowered through the roof of the house Jesus happened to be preaching in.  Imagine it if you will...the house was so jam-packed that they couldn't even squeeze through a window, much less the front door!!  Think about the paralytic man's 3 or 4 buddies who were carrying him....they may have been carrying him all day just to get to the same town Jesus was in.  And when they finally get there, they can't even get to him b/c there's so many stinkin' people!  They probably tried squeezing him in there through every possibly opening in the house too.  So now they're sittin outside the house scratching their heads.  I bet they were probably even a little ticked.  Wouldn't you be??  I know I would have been.  Carrying my friend in the dryness and heat all day to see if this Jesus fella' could actually make the lame walk....and then getting there to discover that they can't even get into the same building!  Yea, I definitely woulda' been talking some major junk!    But let's take a different route:  imagine being the poor paralyzed chap.  Imagine waking up that morning after not being able to even lift your leg or arm your whole life and thinking..." Maybe today's the day!  Maybe I get to hug my wife today!  Maybe I get to run back to my house! "  You get to where Jesus is supposed to be and its really crowded.  In fact, you can't even see him!  And then you see your friends' tired, red faces and you know that something's wrong.  They're not telling you what's going on, but you can tell they're frustrated.  They put you on the ground and walk away for a bit...you're trying to figure out what in the world is going on!  Some time passes and then they all of a sudden come running back to you!  They're pretty excited and are breathing heavy...and before you know it, they're carrying you up a ladder onto a roof!  And, well...I'll let you use your imagination to come up with the rest. :)  Let me just encourage you to think about what was going through that paralyzed man's head.  One word keeps popping into my head:    maybe  .  Maybe is a great word...b/c when it is being used, it means someone is using their imagination.  When you say  "maybe" , you're thinking about what could be.  That paralyzed fella' probably had that word runnin through his mind over and over.    Do you long for something better?  Do you have a dream that you've thought will never happen?  Well let me fill you in on a little secret:  The paralyzed guy in Luke 4 probably dreamed of walking again every day...but likely figured it'd never happen.   Philippians 4:13 tells us  all  things are possible through Christ Jesus.  So today, try saying to yourself " Maybe... "   I know it sounds a little far-fetched or just plain weird.  But probably not as much as the idea of the paralyzed man being able to carry his mat home that night.    "Deeper"   I want to be weaker Be a help to the strong I want to run faster But this old leg won't carry me I want to be, I want to be. Maybe I could run Maybe I could fly, to you.

      You know what...I'm gonna' be totally up front with ya'--I'm not sure how I even get myself out of my hammock in the mornings....for two reasons basically:   1.   I'm usually so wrapped and tangled up in it like a big 'ole spider web that it takes quite a bit of maneuvering and planning just to get one foot on the ground! and  2.   I let myself get wrapped and tangled up in a different type of web--guilt.  I let frustration and despair from past sin and shortcomings get to me so that I waste valuable time moping around the house or office...just ask my friends and coworkers, they notice it! :)  I find myself living out what Paul wrote in his self-description in Romans 7:7-25-- "I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, my sinful nature.  For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out...what a wretched man I am!!!  Who will rescue me from this body of death?"   Things don't have to be that way though...I know I get dirty all the time.  I fall down and fall short of the goal...but guess what, God picks me up, dusts me off, and puts me on the right path. :)  And if we read the very next line in that passage (verse 25), Paul seems to shout out in joy-- "Thanks be to God-through Jesus Christ our Lord!"   Furthermore, in Romans 3:23-24 we're told  "...all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, AND are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus."    What better news is there???    One of my favorite songs in the movie "Charlotte's Web" is the song Charlotte sings for Wilbur called "Chin Up"!  I know you know what I'm talking about! :) But it can be such good advice...can't you imagine Christ reaching his hand under our chin and tilting it upwards to heaven while saying to us, "Chin up, child.  Chin up."  Or let's look at it in a different way--through the words of a powerfully simple praise song we can joyfully sing, "We fall down...but we get up!  Because a saint is just a sinner who fell down, but got up."  I have the tendency to either begin or end with favorite songs of mine, so in that tradition, let me leave you with one by Delirious? called "Investigate".  It's a prayer I often offer to God to keep me on that path He wants me.  I pray its an encouragement for you:    Investigate my life and make me clean Shine upon the darkest place in me To you my life's an open book So turn the page and take a look Upon the life you've made Always, my days, I'll praise     Investigate my life and take me through Shine upon the road that leads to you I know you'd heard the words I'd say Before I'd even lived one day You knew the life you'd made Always, my days, I'll praise     Peace for the journey...

       Please note:  This will be the last published entry until July 14.  During the brief hiatus, please lift up the following youth and sponsors in prayer as we are in Tennessee on a mission trip:  Ben, Sean, John, Stuart, Chris, Carlton, Aaron, Karen, Mary, Laura, Beth, Kindell, Anna, and Atalie. Thanks!  Now, continuing with YouthAdvance!...   The most interesting thing happened to me yesterday (July 4)--  I was walking along the Brazos River with some friends and we came upon a turtle.  The poor fella', Figaro (we'll call him that), was rolling around at the surface of the water, amongst some logs and debris.  We all thought that was rather curious but continued on down the river until someone pointed out that Figaro was caught up in something.  Upon further review, poor 'ole hapless Figaro was caught on a fishing line!    It was at this point that the St. Francis of Assisi came out in me.  (While in college, I did an intensive project on this reknowned patron saint of the poor and non-human.  As a result, a bit of my spirit was transfigured into that of his...so that when situations arise that involve the injury or death of animals, St. Francis comes to life within.)    So as everyone stood there fixed on Figaro and his deathly dilemma, I felt strangely compelled to step down into the muck.  (I have a few choice words for St. Francis once we meet in Glory, let me just get that off my chest real quick. :) )  After positioning myself in the water and mud and drawing Figaro closer, I found that a hook was stuck in his mouth!    It looked pretty bleak as poor Figaro would stop moving for minutes at a time and then slowly show signs of life as he gasped for air at the surface.  It began to look worse as I struggled to free him.  With each tug of the line, which was wrapped tightly around several logs and his legs, Figaro would squeal and moan in pain.  As my heart reeled over this, I eventually grabbed Figaro and began to work the hook out of his mouth.  Continued moans and a bite of my finger were made as the process dragged on for minutes, which seemed like days.    As the water around Figaro and me turned red from our blood, I finally freed dear Figaro of the hook that snared him and the string that entangled him....only to see him immediately swim away without a glance back.    What do I have to show for it?  Simply a scar on my finger and a few eyewitnesses.  But there's the sweet feeling of knowing that Figaro is still part of the community of the Brazos River.  As the hours passed afterwards, it quickly became evident--  Figaro and his mess was a picture perfect example of what I always get myself into...having to have God take me in to His hands and free me.     You ready for the meat???...then let's go!....     As I look back at Figaro, I'm often reminded that I tend to get wrapped up and caught in sin.  And like Figaro and the hook, I routinely get attracted to sin's outer-coating that uses curiosity to draw me in.  And once sin's hook is planted, its so easy to get wrapped and tangled up in its line.    Paul encourages us in Hebrews 12:1 to   throw off the sin that so easily entangles us...  .  Its so important for us to do this before we get wrapped up in it--much like Figaro was in the fishing line.  A second illustration I got from Figaro's fiasco was that of his pain and response to it.  In order for me to pull the hook out of his mouth, I had to cause Figaro more pain...I had to wiggle the hook and, at times, tighten the string around him.  To hear Figaro squeal in agony nearly caused me to quit...but I knew death was certain if I did not free him, so I continued.  Even after Figaro snapped at me and bit my finger, I persisted for his sake.  Isn't God the same way?  In order for healing to begin, additional pain sometimes has to be endured.  In the story of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37), the wine used to clean the injured man's wounds smarted....but was soon soothed by the rubbing oil.  How do we respond in such situations?  Finally, once Figaro was released, he immediately swam to the depths of the water without as much as a  look of gratitude.  It hurts for me to say this...but I see so much of myself in this instance.  How often has God healed or rescued me, only for me to completely blow Him off?  Nine times out of ten?  Its seems certainly possible...especially after reading  Luke 17:11-19 .  In this passage, Christ healed 10 men of leprosy, only to have 1 come back to thank Him.  I wonder what Figaro is doing right now...maybe napping...or snacking...or leisurely swimming around.  But if he's anything like me, he's probably got himself in another mess.  I'm not sure how many times Figaro has to fall into traps before he learns his lesson....but I know that I wonder if I've even learned my lesson yet.    Have you?

      Well, in just a few days from now, the youth of St. Alban's (and a few of us old folk!) will be working in the beautiful rolling hills of Tennessee.  Ah yes, there's nothing better than the cool mountain air on an early summer morn!  The work?  Lovin'!!!...simply trying to be an expression of the love God has shown us.    Living here in Texas...hills are few and far between.  So much so that it is easy to forget the beauty and creativiy of the Almighty God.  What comes to your mind when you think about rolling hills and majestic mountains?  Do you think about the eternal Artist who formed and molded each cliff and slope?  Or do you think about the animals He breathed life into that make their home in the shade of each tree and shrub that this Gardener planted?  Perhaps you think about the Potter that took the landscape into His hands and drew the streams and rivers with His fingertips.      The band Third Day had a few thoughts on it--so much so that they wrote a song called "These Thousand Hills", which is inspired by Psalm 36:     These thousand hills roll ever on Footprints of a Mighty God They bring me to my knees in praise Amazing love, amazing grace     Was on a hill my Savior died A broken heart and bleeding side Hill of the Skull, Mount Calvary The blood He shed, He shed for me    When Heaven's hills at last I roam Forever settled in my home I'll join the saints around Your throne Your kingdom, Lord, rolls ever on    These thousand hills roll ever on Ripples of a coming storm The morning star precedes the dawn These thousand hills roll ever on    What a song!!!  And completely inspired by Scripture!  But I must admit...until I saw the lyrics, I thought they sang:   These thousand hills will never know The footprints of a mighty God He brings me to my knees in praise Amazing love, amazing grace.   (Yea, yea, yea...so I was a little off!) I love the "real" version of the song...but I so much like my misinterpreted version as well!!  For I know that while I'm in Tennessee next week, I'll be looking at the hills around me and thinking that all these thousands of hills in their beauty, might, and splendor will never know the love of the God who made those footprints!  So let me encourage you--whether you're in Texas, on the ocean, or working in the Appalachian Mountains--to spend some time and allow yourself to soak in His love.  For while He made the huge bulging mountains, the raging seas, and the great rolling plains...He also designed each and every one of us for a purpose.    Remember that Christ Jesus tells us in Matthew 17:20-21 that our faith needs only to be the size of a seed in order to move those same mighty mountains that He created!  So soak up His love....let Him nourish that seed of yours so that it can sprout, and grow, and bloom!

        My heart has planned to serve Him.  I must leave the next step to Him.  --Jim Elliot    Leaving the next step up to Him.  That seems to be where I always slip up.  Sure, its easy as 1-2-3 to decide to serve Him.  I remember all the way back to the very beginning of my relationship with Christ.  I had always grown up in the church so I've always known Christ.  But it wasn't until the 11th grade that I decided to quit being stubborn and make Christ both my Lord and Friend.  Once I did that, it was pretty much a no-brainer to decide that my life would be spent serving Him.   It was no-brainer because it was a matter of the heart.  The heart is blind to much of the unecessary trash that the mind sees and longs for--such as status, income, and knowledge.  (We all know what the Bible teaches on all three: Mark 9:35 tells us just how important status should be to us.  Luke 18:25 reminds us that those who are rich are gonna' have a hard time getting into the kingdom!  And 1 Corinthians 8:1 reminds us that seeking knowledge can basically make us cocky....not exactly a favorable trait to have now is it.)    So as a Christian, when you open up your heart to the nudge of God, there's no telling where you may end up!  Jim Elliot also said "The will of God is always bigger than we bargain for."  That's definitely true!  We can ignore God's tugging or nudging of our heart and use our head to do what the world recommends...but if we choose to let Him lead...there's no bounds here on earth that can stop us!  So this takes me right back to the beginning:  Its not deciding to serve Him that is hard...its the waiting for Him.  The "leaving the next step up to Him" part.  And you know what?  I don't have any solid answers on how to wait for God's leading because its something I struggle with daily.  For example:  I came to Waco, Texas in 2000 to go to seminary and then on to the mission field.  Well, as most of you know, I stopped going to school and now work like crazy.  The world is telling me to go back to school where I had a full scholarship, or try another school, or move closer to my family.  And I've found out that I could do any one of those...but my heart is receiving a different answer...and its not from the world.  God's placed me within a community at St. Alban's and Mission Waco that is nurturing me and preparing me for whatever God has in store for me next.  However, I'll be honest, there's some days when I say to myself, "Self, what the heck are you doing in Waco?  Get out and go to the snow and the mountains!!  Move back home to Mom and her homemade milkshakes!"  That's when I find myself having to stop in my tracks and wait on the Lord.   Psalm 16:11 tells us that God directs our paths and fill us with joy while we're in His presence.    Psalm 46:10 encourages us to "be still" and get to know God....to acknowledge Him...to go into His presence.  Are you anxious about something? Unsure? Needing direction? Looking for answers?  He makes known to us the path to take when we stop running around in circles.  Be still and talk to Him.

      Well, I'm a few days removed from the St. Alban's EYC mission trip to Tennessee, and I still can't effectively communicate what exactly the trip meant.  Certain words continue popping up--such as "incredible" and "amazing"--but I'm unable to put intellible sentences together!  Any detailed account of what happened moment-by-moment during the trip will be both overwhelming and a bit too much to read and write in one sitting.  Therefore, I'm going to avoid writing of the daily happenings.  (If you're interested in that, please feel free to contact me though!)  Instead, over the next few entries, I'm going to share certain happenings and lessons that I took away from the  experience .  With that, let me open by saying that I sure hope this past week wasn't simply an  experience .  It pains and worries me to think that the youth and sponsors will walk away from this trip thinking to themselves, "Boy, that was such a great experience!", or "I'm glad I experienced that!"  An experience comes and goes and not much is to be said of it in the long run.  A tetanus shot--now that's an experience!  You get one and its either not so bad, or it kicks your butt!  And you walk away saying, "I hope I don't have to experience that for a good long while!"  Experiences, whether they are good or bad, hit us big at first but become distant memories later on.  So to think that we'll walk away from the shadows of the Appalachian Mountains and say, "What an experience!  I'm sure glad I got to see that!"...well, it scares me.    Its my prayer that each member of the team met Jesus that week...and will be freshly and forever changed as a result.  For some folks on the trip, it may have been the 100th time to witness Christ....but for others, it was their very first time.  And no matter how many times it happens, each time someone runs into Jesus, history is forever changed.    Let's look at some examples:  1.  The Apostle Paul, who is accredited with leading and starting the first churches and writing most of the New Testament, was once a persecutor of Christians.  He was even at the stoning of Stephen! (Acts 7:54-8:1)  But something happened shortly after he took part in the murder of Stephen.   Paul met Jesus.  (Acts 9) Its quite incredible...for in the very passage that Paul was met by Christ, it opens with  Meanwhile, Paul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples.   Two verses later, the Lord knocked Paul right off his feet and onto the ground.  Paul was speechless and blind!  It goes on to say in verse 20 that after he regained his strength, he immediately set out to the Lord's work!  Thanks be to God!  2.  In  John 4 , the Samaritan Woman encounters Christ.  As she went to the town well to draw water, she came upon Christ sitting at the well.  This must have been a very intimidating experience b/c not only was she a woman...but a Samaritan woman in the midst of a Jewish man.  Furthermore, she had basically shared her bed with several men...and not even as their wife!  But Christ meets her where she is nonetheless, and in verse 28 it tells us she drops the water jug where she is and goes back to share the Good News she has heard.  It doesnt' stop there either!  Just read verse 39!!  It tells us that many more Samaritans came to know Christ as a result of that once lowly, dirty woman!    Paul and the woman at the well were living shameful lives...and were headed on a collision course with disaster.  Paul was responsible for the deaths of many Christians and the woman was living a life of sexual and moral sin.  However, they both met Christ on a path...and both ended up choosing different ones as a result.  Paul shaped early Christianity for crying outloud!  And the woman changed her city for Christ!  These are just two among a host of testimonies the Bible provides...just look at Peter, Mary Magdalene, and Cornelius!    Folks who met Jesus were changed...simple as that.   It wasn't simply an "experience".  Paul didn't just have a Damascus Road Experience....his life was altered...changed.  The woman at the well didn't have an experience w/ Christ there.  Instead she was given a new life and freedom that she never knew before.  And as a result, she boldly shared Christ w/ the city that once scorned her.  So its my prayer that we just didn't experience a good trip to Tennessee.  I hope Christ knocked us off our feet like He did Paul.  Perhaps He told some us to leave our burden at the well like He did the woman.  We've got work to do...lives to change.  Let's begin with ours!

        My apologies to you guys for another extended absence from blogging.  My parents visited from Virginia this week...and being the momma's boy that I am, I never left their side.  :)  From this point on though, expect regular entries every other day or so.    Goodness gracious...for the past 3 or 4 weeks, my life has been anything  but  normal!  I returned from the mission trip two weeks ago from today and housesat for the two weeks after that.  In the middle of all that, my parents made the two-day drive down from Virginia.  Last night was the first night I've slept in my own house since July 5th!!!    In the midst of all this craziness, there's so much to look back on...but as I focus on the mission trip itself, I make it a point to remember each face in the group that went and the expressions on Ann and Laymon's faces as we spent time with them while repairing their home.  There is no doubt Texan and Tennesseean lives were changed that week....even a Virginian's life was forever changed! :)  Yet despite this, its so easy to forget the week...forget God's working on our lives.  It seems hard, especially when looking at the previous journal entry where we looked at those who met Jesus and were never the same afterwards.  However, on the flipside, there are those who met Jesus but weren't catapulted into a new life of love and power.  Just look at Judas, one of Christ's own disciples!  Furthermore, take a look at the rich young man in Mark 10.  These were fella's who met Jesus, talked with him, dined with him, and even followed him but chose paths contrary to what Christ taught.  Judas even handed Christ over to authorities to be arrested!    So as we look at the choices we have once Christ is met, look at the examples in Scriptures:  1.  You have folks like Paul and the Samaritan woman at the well who change their lives and the lives of those around them once they experience Christ!  2.  You also have those like the rich young man and Judas who, sadly, turn away from His teaching and lead lives of destruction.  Why did the two different groups choose the paths they took?  Well, I'm not too certain, but I have an idea....  Turn to Isaiah 6.  Found it yet?  Its the book in b/w Genesis and Revelation. :)  In this passage, Isaiah met God as well.  His meeting was probably a bit similar to Paul's meeting w/ Christ.  Read verses 1-4.  Can you imagine what it would have been like to go through that?? I probably would have wet my pants!!!  To see the Lord "high and lifted up"...with the angels singing...which of course caused everything around poor Isaiah to shake and tremble!    What happens next is important:  In verse 5 once Isaiah witnesses the presence of the Lord, he sees how low and sinful and dirty he is.  He cries out "Woe is me!!"  I can only imagine what that would have felt like...he probably felt like he should have died right then and there.  But in the verses to follow, Isaiah was   touched   by God, and told that he was cleansed and forgiven.  Wow!!  How awesome that must have been!!!  So when we look at the 4 characters we've talked about recently--Paul, the Samaritan woman, the rich young man, and Judas--they probably all had similar feelings around Christ.  To witness the power of Jesus, whether it be through his presence, miracles, perfect life, or amazing teachings probably left them all feeling worthless and dirty.  I know it would me!  But the difference b/w them all is their reactions:    --The Samaritan woman, who had slept with many men outside of marriage and was probably the joke of the town, realized she was cut free from the slavery of guilt and sin and went to boldly tell the good news!  --Paul, who was responsible for the persecution and deaths of Christians, and even called himself the worst of sinners dropped the weight of sin off his back and ran the race Christ marked for him. (Hebrews 12:1)  However, --The rich young man walked away from Jesus in sadness b/c he was more in love with his money than the Lord.  Mark 10:22   --Judas ended up hanging himself over the despair he had after turning Christ, his own friend, in to be murdered. Matthew 27   So what will you choose?  We all know we've sinned  Romans 3:23 .  We look at Christ and what he's done for us and we can't help but cry out, "Woe is me!  What good am I?!?!  I'm nothing but a dirty, rotten person!"    But if we let him, Christ will touch us and wipe off that dirtiness...that guilt...that shame the disables us.  He did it for Isaiah, for the Samaritan woman, for Paul, and for countless others.  He'll do it for us too.  We just need to ask and let Him.

      The computers were down most of the day at work, so I decided to fold brochures in order to not throw my "system" off by working offline.  So for a good chunk of the day, I sat in a swivel chair and at a big wooden desk while folding 8'' X 14" papers.  It wasn't long that I started complaining and yawning!    Anyways, what struck me was that as I sat there in the stale, white fluorescently lit office, the song "Seize the Day" by Carolyn Arends played...twice actually.  The words cut straight through my boredom and frustration in an instant.  For the chorus of the song is this:    Seize the day. Seize whatever you can, For life slips away just like hourglass sand. Seize the day.  Pray For grace from God's hand, Then nothing will stand in your way-- Seize the day!    Wow.... for life slips away like hourglass sand.   Isn't that the truth!!    What good is it to sit in a cubicle or a smug office and type into a computer, sign letters, and talk on the phone all day?  Is it worth it?  Why do we do it?  Is it because we love doing it?  Or could we be doing something much more nobler, something much more worthwhile, something much more  fun ?  There are places in the world rarely seen by man....cultures rarely experienced...feats not yet accomplished!  Why not take a step into the unknown?  I seem to be asking myself these questions a lot lately.  There are many days that I ponder about when I get to take my next vacation so that I can get out of the office.  And there are plenty of days when I long for my sabbatical to Alaska!!!   Should I be doing this?  Shouldn't I look forward to each day of service as if its a vacation?  My thoughts aren't too fluid today, but its just something on my heart--why are we doing what we do?  --Do we go to college simply for a piece of paper that allows us a high-paying job that we won't necessarily enjoy after two years?    --Are we working a decent paying job now that we don't like at all simply for the cash flow?  I dont' have too much to say on the topic except this:  it seems that if we are in school or at a job for these reasons then we're not heeding the words of Christ in Matthew 6:25-34.  In that passage He encourages us to not worry about our future and to not store up wealth for future use, because tomorrow will simply take care of itself.    I recently had to take that step while in grad school.  I was miserable as a student there.  And its not b/c I was doing poorly either--I made all A's while there.  But I felt my life being sucked from me there.  And the only reason I was there was to make myself "ready" for ministry...to get another diploma saying I was ready to make more money.  Well, let's just say I got out of there.  For professors and papers don't ready us (even though they can certainly aid the process), the Holy Spirit does.  I'm not doing the topic much justice right now...forgive me.  But perhaps Carolyn Arends will:    "Seize the Day" Well I know a doctor, a fine young physician, He left a six figure job for a mission position. He's healing the sick in an African clinic. He works in the dirt and writes home to the cynics. He says, 'We work through the night so that every day, as we watch the sunrise we can say,'      Seize the day. Seize whatever you can, 'Cause life slips away just like hourglass sand. Seize the day.  Pray For grace from God's hand, Then nothing will stand in your way-- Seize the day!      I know a man who's been doing some thinking He's as bitter and cold as the whiskey he's drinking. He's talking about fear...about chances not taken If you listen to him you can hear his heart breaking. He says, 'One day you're a boy and the next day you're dead.  I wish way back when, someone had said,'      Seize the day. Seize whatever you can, 'Cause life slips away just like hourglass sand. Seize the day.  Pray For grace from God's hand, Then nothing will stand in your way-- Seize the day!      Well one thing I've noticed, wherever I wander Everyone's got a dream he can follow or squander. You can do what you will with the days you are given I'm trying to spend my on the business of living.    Amen.  Seize the day!  Live it as if its your last!

      Ok, so you can use whichever illustration you prefer--that I've been alseep for the past   three months  and am now waking from my slumber, that I went into a coma due to my excessive sweet tea intake, or that I've just had an extended vacation in Mozambique for the past   three months.    So let me extend deepest apologies for my over-extended absence.  And much thanks to the faithful friends and family out there who kept calling me back out of my sleep, coma, or vacation in Mozambique (whicever you choose, of course).  Please feel free to list any comments, complaints, suggestions, jokes, and/or prayer requests by clicking on the "comments" link at the end of each entry.  Lord-willing, I hope to write at least every other day.  Please hold me accountable guys!   Now, on w/ the blog..... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On peace...   Goodness, such a vague word...there's a whole mess of directions we could go w/ this.  However, one thing comes to mind.  As we look around us today and see how chaotic things are w/ random killings, bombings, earthquakes, fires, wars, etc., it makes it seem like peace will never be reached.  And then if you happen to stumble across   Luke 12:51  , you can't help but wonder if there ever will be peace!  For in it, Christ says  Do you think I came to bring peace on earth?  No, I tell you, but division.    "How can this be?", one must ask when presented with this evidence...especially since Christ is known as the Prince of  Peace , and since he told us in   John 14:27   that he actually left us his  peace.   How could this be?  One minute the Lord Christ says he gives us peace, and in the next he says he's here to cause strife!  Well, the important key here is to not think of peace as a time without war or pain or struggle.  In Hebrew, the word for peace ( shalom ) means a fullness...or having everything you need to be wholly and happily yourself.  Interesting huh.  So what makes us whole?  Well, the love of Christ of course!    1 Peter 5:10   tells us that in the midst of our suffering, Christ will come and restore us and make us firm, steadfast, strong....whole.  So its now that we see this:   For Jesus, peace does not mean the absence of struggle, but the presence of love.  --Frederick Buechner    Peace guys. Aaron

      When you think about it, all different kinds of folks ended up meeting Christ...ya' know?  People who were rich and famous, as well as people who were penniless.  The righteous, as well as the sinfully dirty.  The list could go on and on.  When you think of the folks who met Christ, who comes to mind?  Peter?  Judas?  The Samaritan lady at the well?  Zacchaeus?  Pilate?  Right now if you were to ask me that question, I'd probably have to say Simeon.  No, not Simon... Simeon .  No, not the fisherman who Christ called to be a disciple ( Luke 5 ), but the little old man in  Luke 2:25-35  who was promised by God that he wouldn't die until he had seen Christ.  Pretty wild huh?  Simeon must have been pretty tight with God to have had that honor...ya' know?  In verse 25 it says he was both "righteous and devout".    In that day, the Jews had a whole mess of ideas about what Christ would be like.  Many were expecting royalty.  Others (like Judas) were expecting this great military leader.  And as a result, many totally missed out on Christ.  Not Simeon though. :)  Good 'ole Simeon recognized Jesus as the Christ when he was just  8 days old!!!   Simeon was able to see through the fact that this little child, who probably still smelled of the manger and swaddling clothes, was being carried around by a poor carpenter named Joseph and some unimportant lady named Mary.  Simeon could see that Christ was actually the Son of God...even though the child was only 8 days old!     So what did Simeon see that others like Judas didn't?   Well, nothing really.  In fact, Judas probably saw more than Simeon...Judas got to witness Christ as an adult who was actively healing and preaching!  The catch here is in verses 25 and 26 of  Luke 2 .  We're told Simeon was  righteous, devout, and moved by the Spirit of God .  It was the condition of Simeon's heart that was the deciding factor here.  He had allowed God control of his life...so that when Simeon was shown the Christ child as promised, no matter what the child looked like, he would take him in his arms and praise God as he did in verse 28.    So the question for us is this:   What is the condition of our heart?...Is it given over to God so that we'll embrace Christ with all our might?  Or is it focused on what we personally want so that we reject what Christ has to offer?

        Can you change your life in 24 hours?    I was at the movies recently and a trailer came on with that question showing all throughout the preview.  The movie was about a guy who was given 24 hours of freedom before going to prison for the rest of his life.  And, as you can tell, that got me thinking  :) ....  But what do you think?   If you were notified that you had 24 hours left to live...or 24 hours left of freedom... what would you do?    I'm sure a lot of folks would say things like "I'd go sky diving", or "Share my true feelings with the one I love", or even "Eat as much fried chicken as my body could handle". :)  I'm not sure I'd particularly do that, but I'm sure some folks would. :)  There are two points that I got just from sittin and thinking about that question....mind if I share?  Why thank ya'! :)   Point 1:  In 24 hours, its a whole heck of a lot easier to wreck your life than change it for the better.  Or in other words, it takes only hours, minutes, seconds to make a mistake...but it could potentially take a whole lifetime to make up for it.  For instance, when it comes to premarital sex: a few minutes of pleasure can lead to pregnancy, disease, death, and a lifetime of guilt.  Breaking curfew or lying to loved ones can destroy trust that will take years to rebuild.    However, that being said...given 24 hours to change your life for the better, what would you do?  Where would you begin?  See, just because its harder to change your life for the better in a short amount of time, doesn't mean its impossible.  We humans have a certain knack for performing under pressure.  Athletes become famous for rising above the rest during critical moments of a game.  And in school, many students tend to do their best work when they have to cram...am I right?  I think I am. :)  So given that, perhaps if we went into each day as if its all we have left, then we'd have a passion like no other to right the wrongs we've commited.  And maybe, just maybe, there'll be a change. :)    This leads us to our 2nd point...   Point 2:  We're really only guaranteed the day we've got, ya' know?   This 24 hours.   So why shouldn't we live today like its our last???  Christ even told us this in  Matthew 24:36-51. He reminded us that  noone knows about the day or hour...   Noone knows it...enough said.  So if we get to tomorrow and realize we don't have tomorrow, what do we do?  All I know is this: we won't get to tomorrow and come to that realization... so live, brothers and sisters!   Peace

      I've always wondered how to accurately express this unconditional love of Christ--so pure, so true, so powerful, so perfect, so overwhelming.  Well, for a time I was quite discouraged because there is really no way we can do such a daunting task.  Ya' know what I'm sayin?  However, I believe I stumbled across someone who has at least begun to pick the lock to this truth.  The fella'?...a A.W. Tozer.  Check this out...    I can do no more justice to the awesome wonder-filled theme called love than a child can grasp a star.  Still, by reaching toward the star the child may call attention to it and even indicate the direction one might look to see it.  So, as I stretch my heart toward the high, shining love of God, someone who has not before known about it may be encouraged to look up and have hope.    So beautifully put!  Trying to even  grasp  the understanding of God's love for us is hard enough...let alone explain it!  As Tozer put it, its probably a lot like a child trying to reach a star.  Its impossible.   However,  that child can reach for that star and thus turn our heads upward....just as we can focus on and even reach for Christ, which will cause some to gaze upward to our Hope...our Love...our Life.  Another thing, if that child stays devoted to the gazing at of stars and has the passion to learn all he can about those very stars...he'll eventually get a telescope.  Next he may buy a few beginner's books.  Perhaps even take a few classes in high school.  If the child continues with his love for the stars, he'll go to college to learn astronomy where he finds out all there is to know about the stars of the heavens.  His next step could find him among those stars as an astronaut.    The same goes for us!  Right now, we can only point to the source of the Love without really being able to fully understand, explain, or even appreciate it.  But just as the child with the stars, if we continue to feed our passion for that love of Christ we'll perhaps study it more...open the Word more...and do all we can to find ourselves right in the middle of His love!  The apostle Paul does a good job of trying to explain the unfathomable love in   1 Corinthians 13.    Read it.  You'll see he straight up will define it.  He says love is  patient, kind, polite, protecting, trusting, hoping, persevering.   But then in  verses 9-12  he reminds us that we'll really not be able to grasp it completely.  He wonderfully writes in v. 12,   Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face.  Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.    So let me encourage you, as you look into that murky glass to catch a glimpse of Love:  Keep it up!  Because soon we'll find ourselves like that child who found himself among those very stars that he could simply point to years before.  We'll find ourselves  face to face  with that Love...with Christ!  Gazing myself...

      Many of you have heard me tell plenty of colorful stories about my family back home in Virginia--my mom and dad, my brother, and even our dog, Gracie Jo. :)  (Yes, we gave her a middle name!)  Gracie is undoubtedly the perfect dog.  She's a "pek-a-poo" (that's pronounced "peek-a-poo"...she's half-pekingnese/half poodle), which means she weighs a mere 8 pounds.  Gracie has never hurt a soul her whole life and is without any enemies whatsoever.  Oh, and by the way...she's so cute that you can't help but grin just looking at her. :)  Hard times struck this past weekend unfortunately.  My dad was taking Gracie on a walk down the street when all of a sudden, three dogs broke through their electric fence and attacked her.  Dad immediately snatched Gracie up into his arms.  However, as he was lifting her up, one of the dogs bit her eye so that it literally came out of its socket.  Dad then hurried Gracie to the car and onto the vet.  Gracie had emergency surgery on the same day and ended up losing her right eye.  Needless to say, the whole Dowdy clan was, and still is, pretty shaken up.  Gracie is still in recovery and we're all waiting and hoping for that same energy and playfulness to return to her.  The very night this happened, I was drifiting off to sleep in the midst of tears of anger and absolute sadness when a lesson hit me.  In the middle of my sorrow, God's allowed me to be reminded of some old truths, as well as learn some new ones.    First,  bad things happen to not only good people....but the best of beings.   Gracie in no way deserved what happened to her.  She's an angel in fur.  Christ in no way deserved the treatment he was put through...but yet He went through it.  Why do horrible things happen to wonderful people?  Well, that's a tough question to answer that I'm not completely sure of.  But I do know this, God experienced exactly what its like to be put through actual hell while not deserving it.  So in our pain, He reaches out to us to soothe.  Second,  trouble will still occur if we're on the path of our Father.   My dad was leading Gracie down the road.  In fact, she was right on his heels.  Regardless, she was ambushed and battered.  The same goes for us.  If we're following our Heavenly Dad down the road of His choice, it doesn't mean we're exempt from pain and trouble.  They're bound to happen.  Continue to look at our perfect example, Christ.  There's no doubt that He was on the right path, and look at the pain He went through.   Finally, when we're following our Father's lead and bad things still happen inexplicably,  comfort comes in Dad's touch...and in His voice.   When my dad was taking Gracie to the vet, the one thing that stuck out the most in his mind was the fact that Gracie, while bleeding and in severe pain, dug deep into his lap.  She was dazed, hurting, blind, and confused--so she took comfort in the one place she knew...the place where she could curl up in during times of joy and during times of excruciating pain.    Furthermore, just before surgery, the vet brought Gracie to my parents one last time so they could get one last kiss in.  Mom and Dad couldn't help but notice how motionless and lifeless she was when the vet brought her out.  But when mom started talking to her and touched her, Gracie's tail began to wag and she snuggled up close to Mom.    Its on this last thought that I want to encourage you.  There'll be times when you'll feel like a piece of you has literally been ripped from you.  Many people have the tendency to withdraw during these times.  But take a page from Gracie--dig deep into Dad's lap and listen for His voice.  For its in that gentle tone and touch that healing begins.   (In the meantime, please keep my family and me in your prayers.)   Peace

        One generation will commend your works to another; they will tell of your mighty acts.  They will speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty, and I will meditate on your wonderful works.  Psalm 145:4-5    A lot of you have heard me talk about how much I like the popular prime-time tv show, "Ed"...and there's even been some of you who have gotten hooked on the show as well!!!  While I wouldn't endorse the show as a good sit-down-with-your-family-after-dinner type of show, I will say that it does offer plenty of humor and even some good questions/arguments that can apply to our faith and beliefs.  For instance, 2 weeks ago:  the main character, Ed, (who is the bowling alley owner/lawyer who runs both practices in the same building) was told by some agency that projects people's age-expectancy that he'd live to be 83.  This news immediately affected Ed, to say the least.  Realizing he was almost halfway through his life, he began looking at his ancestors and those around them while obseriving legacies people left behind.  As a result, poor 'ole Ed became dissatisfied with the type of legacy he was leaving behind.  So he began exploring different ways to become famous--pottery, painting, music, etc.  Needless to say, he realized he was really good at two things:  running a bowling alley and practicing law.    Throughout the show, Ed wrote different sayings and quotes that he would like to have on his tombstone.  Some were funny, some serious, while others were sad.  Finally, as the show closed, he came up with what he wanted.  His second-to-last idea was "Ed Stevens--Art was his life".  Well, watching the show you easily could see that Ed was not in the least bit artistic.  Ed realized that too.  But he changed the words around to something a little different so that it read: "Ed Stevens--Life was his art."    There's 3 observations I'd like to make:  1.   Is life your art?   There are many types of artists out there.  Some, when they paint, appear to sling paint onto a canvas without much rhyme or reason to it.  Others put amazing amounts of detail and care into their paintings.  Both styles are considered artistic and are well-accepted!  So what does your canvas look like?  It doesn't necessarily matter  what  you do to it as long as you do  something.   Is your life consumed by work, or school, or worry, or sports?  Or is your life a wonderfully artistic blend of passion, fun, sadness, success, and failure so that its a piece of art?  2.   Don't focus on what legacy you'll leave behind.   While its good to leave behind something...don't dwell on it!  Use Psalm 145 as your guide.  It talks of generation upon generation talking about God's splendor and majesty and wonder....not yours.  So with the time you have, use it to aid this and the next generation in noticing the legacy of Christ.  3.   Finally, while there are people out there who claim to be able to predict how long you live, only you can determine how you live.   What does it matter what your age-expectancy is?  You're in control of your life-expectancy--what you do with the life you have.  So use it!  Peace,

        Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.  But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal.  For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.  Matthew 6:19-21    Spend any quality with me and you'll soon find that I absolutely love looking at movies, on tv, in music, and everywhere else possible to try to find teachable material...stuff that we can use to help us understand Jesus' teachings a little better.    And believe you me, there's plenty out there!  Just look at "Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings"!  But perhaps one of my favorite movies to draw from is the one I saw on tv yesterday while laid up in my sick bed.  The movie series that I'm referring to is none other than the "Indiana Jones" trilogy.  If you've got the third movie, "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", pop it in your VCR or DVD player and go towards the end.  Throughout the whole movie, Indiana Jones and friends are in a kind of race against the Nazis to find the actual cup that Christ used at the Last Supper.  If you've not seen it, go rent it!  (Or you can ask my parents, I believe they have my copy!)  So anyways, at the end you find the opposing parties together at the site of the grail.  The Nazis take hostage Indiana Jones and Co.  And to persuade Jones to make the final dangerous steps to get the grail, they shoot his father.  You see, the grail is supposed to have healing power, so the only way to keep his father from dying is to go get the grail.  So, to make a long story short Indiana valiantly reaches the grail, brings it back to his father, saves his father, and defeats the remaining Nazis.    However, as they begin to leave, the foolish damsel of the movie takes the grail with her.  With any other grail, that'd be no problem of course...but with this particular artifact, if you tried to leave the site then it'd all come crashing down on you.  So, as you imagine, the cave...that's right... all came crashing down on them.   As luck would have it, Miss Damsel trips and falls, causing the cup to bounce it's way into a ravine.  She soon finds herself hanging on by one arm, trying to reach the cup with her free hand.  Just as her arm gives way Indiana Jones comes to rescue Miss Damsel in distress.  However, she refuses to give Indiana her other arm and eventually she loses grip and falls into the pit of despair.  (Oh wait, the pit of despair is from "Princess Bride".)  Either way, Miss Damsel falls to her death.  So the earth is given a good shake and Indiana falls over and into the same position the late Miss Damsel previously was--hanging on by one arm.  But this time, his father has gotten ahold of his arm.  And with Indiana's free arm, he can nearly grab the cup.  In fact, his fingertips are touching it!  He simply needs one more inch!    His father says, "Indiana!  Give me your other hand."  You see Indiana's eyes widening with the thrill of nearly reaching the cup....then you see his hand touching it.  Indiana replies, "I can almost reach it dad!"  Indiana's hand begins to slip more and more from his father's.  The next shot is of his father's face, calm but concerned.  In the midst of all that chaos--the ceiling caving in, the earth giving way, people dying, Indiana slipping from his grasp--the father simply says, "Junior.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Give me your other hand."  That oh so familiar, comforting voice grabs Indiana's attention and with that, Indiana looks up and gives his father the other hand just as he's about to fall to his death.  Wow!  I must say, each time I watch that, it moves me more and more.  What a beautiful scene!    At the beginning of this entry I posted the passage from Matthew where Christ tells us not to bother with storing up "treasures here on earth", but to concern ourselves with "treasures in heaven".  The grail Indiana was after was surely a treasure on earth!  But not just because it would have brought him wealth.  It would have also brought him fame with no end and power beyond belief.  Perhaps it was a little of what the prodigal son was after in  Luke 15 .  He left his father for his own life...to build his own fame and fortune.  But we soon read that it took him to the edge of death.  Just as Indiana's brief encounter with the grail did.  So where are you now?  Are you seeking out or storing up treasures here on earth?  Worried about how big your house will be?  How much money you'll make once you're on your own?  Or even how you'll gain the attention of someone at school?  Have you become a bit like the prodigal son?  Have you wanted to do things your own way?    Let me encourage you to drop it.  Times are crazy right now in the world.  You're hearing all kinds of noise and temptations, just as Indiana did in those brief moments.  But listen for that soothing, penetrating voice of the Father saying "Junior...Son....Daughter...give me your other hand."  Reach up and grab your Father's hand before it's too late.

        Calmer than the sky Far away so blue Land of living God Grant your peace on earth  We can feel you move And cannot stay the same The winds are blowing strong God of heaven come  Breathe peace Breathe your peace on us So we might breathe you deep Breathe peace Breathe your peace on us The land of the living God  If we are in the way  Move us to the side God forgive our wrongs Rest your hands on us  All the world is yours Let us not forget It was you who bore the cross                           --R. Seay   Peace.  In times like these, there's no doubt that peace is much needed, but it seems to be scarcely sought with earnest.  Living in Waco, TX, I see my share of pro-Bush, pro-War supporters.  On the flipside, there's a good number of anti-war persons who make their voice heard.  I find my head spinning more and more as the tension seems to grow daily!   Where do we go from here?   Those in favor of war use the desire for the establishment of peace as part of their justification, while those against war stand on the argument that war brings not peace but destruction and distrust.  My own views are irrelevant at this point.  For right now, all I want is peace.  And I'm not talking about the absence of struggle that we so often define peace as being.  Regardless of whether or not we go to war, there will always be struggle.  I'm talking about the peace that Frederick Buechner describes as being "the presence of love."  It is the same love that covers a multitude of sins.  The same love that is driven by self-sacrifice and humility.  The same love that is defined by both the turning of the other cheek as well as the confronting of those who wish to disgrace God's temple.  It is that very love that looked on the lost and ruined condition of all humanity and rejected the idea of giving up on it.  Rather, this love gallantly rode into earth as the Prince of Peace....as a defenseless Jewish infant in a stable.  So is it on this love that we finally figure out peace?  I would say yes....YES!    It is with this declaration that I encourage you with the lyrics posted at the beginning of this entry:  Lord,if we are in the way, move us to the side.  Remind us that all the world is yours.  Its our hope that we can feel you move and cannot stay the same.  God of heaven come!  Breathe peace.  Breathe Your peace on us.   Peace for the nations,
