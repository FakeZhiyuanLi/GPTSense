      Dear fictional blog perouser,  It's hard for me to belive that what I write here could conceivably be read by a plethora of strangers. I am sitting in my little bedroom in absolute solitude, fluffy leopard-print slippers on my feet, listening to a blues station on internet radio (also a first), and the idea that somebody other than me could be reading this seems somehow incongruous with my current setting. Obviously I've never had a blog before. This entry marks official blogspew #1.  Is it narcissism? Solipsism? Boredom? What compels people to publish their innermost thoughts on the internet? For me, being the practical girl that I am, it's born of a desire to maintain the compulsive journal-keeping I used to do as a rule but have neglected of late. A combination of having a new sexy laptop and (finally,  finally ) having net access at home, means I spend lots of time online regardless of whether I have reason to, and what better way to waste time and be simultaneously proactive than by keeping an online journal??? Huh?  Plus, I need an outlet for my writing. There's always that. I find that sharing it with friends means I have to censor a lot of stuff, whereas here, in this cyberbubble of pseudo anonymity, I don't give a shit. Most of what I write is such fruity brain blather that most people wouldn't be interested anyway but here people have a choice - they can switch me off and go back to their porn or chicken recipes or net banking or whatever else they were doing before they got distracted by this blog -  or  perhaps one or two people in a hundred will actually keep reading, and maybe post a comment, in which case my yay-ometer will hit dingaling. It's nice when somebody reads ya, hears ya, and throws something back at ya. I wouldn't even care if it was a smelly old asylum escapee living on cat food in a house full of plastic bags with a finger growing out of one eye so that he had to type with his head...  And this is  not  going to be one of those boring blogs where people just report what they did in a day. People, please, give it some personality, eh? There is so much shite out there that it's really hard to find anything worth reading. If anyone has any recommendations for blogs that are well-written, intelligent and creative, please name-drop mercilessly. I am a sponge and the written word is my spilt milk. I am a gaping wall-wound and words are my spakfiller. I am a starving chinchilla and words are my special-diet-that-excludes-cabbage, corn and lettuce (apparently they die of farting if they eat those). You get my point.  Welcome.

      Yes, he did come back to my place. Yes, we had sex. Yes, it was great. It was all great up until the point in the morning when he got up and left like it was  any other morning , like we didn't just spend the night together for the first time in two weeks, like he was just going to the shop for some juice and muffins and a box of rose petals and champagne and chocolates and would be back in minutes. Because as usual, he had  stuff  to do. Stuff that supercedes those two wonderful concepts: spontaneity and romance. Important stuff like cleaning the shelves of his old place to get his bond back, and making music.   But I don't hold it against him. I'm too busy with my own ostensible nonchalance.   The ambivalence I've cultivated will serve me well with this one. From here I could take it or leave it without too much fuss. Seven months - my shortest relationship. It's not even enough time to begin, let alone break each other's hearts. Next to my four-year-mindfuck-man, Cuzzy is peaches and vanilla custard on madeira with cherries and icing and maybe some toasted coconut. Hey, that actually sounds like a really tasty dessert, if it was soy custard and if the icing was like, lemon or something.  We started at yum cha. He arrived before me. Jeans and a black scarf and a navy blazer that I had never seen before that made him look so much older. When I walked in he was ordering because he was starving, and he greeted me with a careful coolness that is  so   Cuzzy, without which I think he'd dissolve into a blathering mess of (gasp) FEELINGS. We spent the evening in easy conversation. Or at least I talked while he ate, being not very hungry myself after two pints of Coopers at the pub with the guys from the office. He was reserved and uncertain and very determined to appear in control. It's almost laughable, his transparency. Beautiful, daft, bigsoft man. At several points I nearly lost my cool and had to hold myself back from walking out because the aloof game has been played ad nauseum and I just wanted something real. After dinner we left to have some beers. I could have parachuted into the cavern between us. It would have taken a while to land.  A drink and a half down he had to call the Sydney Morning Herald in order to be interviewed for Friday's Metro. It took around 20 minutes and when he came back he seemed more relaxed, or perhaps I was destracted by the drunk teenager across the road who had stumbled out of McDonalds and into the wall and nearly concussed himself and fell straight to the ground and was throwing up and dragging himself along the footpath on his belly. I had almost given up on getting a glimpse at the beefy red muscle that allegedly throbs behind Cuzzy's ribs, but then it happened. I think he said that I should go with him to Bondi to see his new place. I said that he should come to my place, which was walking distance away. His reticence was temporary and he didn't need too much convincing. Somehow his head was buried in my neck and his arms were around me and he was softly sniffling and gently inhaling the smell of my skin and when he moved back his eyes were wet and I smiled at him because finally I was seeing something that was real and the defences had been jettisoned and he was letting vulnerability have its moment and my faith in him was restored. Mostly.  Cuzzy, if you were a tin of beans it would be much easier - I'd just grab a can opener and out they would spill, but you're a cryptic labyrinth with guards at your soft centre, no password and no keys. I'd love to solve that tiresome fucking maze.  But oh, how sweet it is to be fucked by you.  In the night he woke me by talking in his sleep, which has happened several times before and is a source of fabulous hilarity for me. He just feels violated. This time he suddenly yelled  "Faaaaarkin yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh!"  I nearly wet myself laughing and haven't stopped yet.   I miss sleeping naked next to another big lump of skin and limbs and meat. We spiralled around each other like DNA.

      I'm being head-hunted by a work colleague (and unfortunately a computer nut) who is insatiably curious about my blog. I'd rather he didn't read it.   Sweetu, get back to work.

      Sydney is hosting auditions for Australian Idol this weekend and I have this hankering to go to Darling Harbour and just mooch about being A Strayin' Idle just checking out the motley assemblage of hopefuls. From glimpses of the auditions in previous years there are generally a lot of people who look exactly the same; a few colourful and interesting muppets, and some oddballs of the  what the fuck IS that  variety who seem hand-picked from Australia's Darkest Street Corners - a few pineapples short of a plantation. I like the idea of standing back and observing a large group of determined, competing individuals, some of whom will have grand hopes pinned to their success in this particular (ultimately meaningless, though what isn't) endeavour.  We need a fridge. It's starting to affect our sanity. And our health. Since I moved to Surry Hills I have been eating the same brown-rice-and-black-eyed-beans casserole for breakfast each day which I buy from a nice health food shop called Zenergy, which has really good stuff, but at that time in the morning all they have is said casserole or nachos or cakey-muffin type affairs, and I cannot eat a plate of cheesy corn chips for breakfast. I'd rather lick a freezer. On the inside. And sugar cake stuff is to be avoided as well, even if it is just honey or glucose or organic belly-lining-of-exotic-sugar-ant sweetened. I'm lying. Sometimes I do eat one for breakfast. Sometimes I just eat fruit. Today I had banana bread and tamari roasted almonds. I am such a liar.  BUT who cares? I'm only lying to myself.  I just got back from the gym where I spent forty minutes bouncing astronaut style on a cross-trainer, thinking about this blog and how it could become a personal legacy. I envisaged my daughter (who doesn't exist yet, thank fuck) at age 8 or 9 asking to read my blog, to which I reply "when you're older." Seems I anticipate a bit of adult content.  When Steve arrived at the office this morning the first thing he said to me was, "you didn't think I'd do it, did you?" I looked at him quizzically. He pulled the sleeve of his t-shirt up to his shoulder to reveal a small yin-yang tattoo, black and white, wonky. Yesterday he vaguely mentioned he felt like getting his first tattoo. "I don't feel pain" is something he is prone to saying. He believes it too.   "Cool. How much?" I asked.  "One fifty." I didn't say anything. He had clearly been grossly over-charged for a very shit tattoo of which he was quite proud. Having just recently met a girl who seemed interested in seeing him again Steve has applied some changes, the most noteworthy of which is the head-shave: all the way, razor-style. He has a glowing pink cranium. My new favourite game is called "Steve's Electric Head" where I shuffle my shoes on the carpet and then zap his head with an electric shock from my finger. "Does anyone else want a go?!" he yelled today, after I'd gone the zap a few times. Adam declared he would try out Steve's electric head a bit later.  Quality guy is Steve. One of those beaut blokes who makes you think, wow, what a  good guy . He's all chicken twisties and thanks for calling Sir. He's all meat pie and I-do-apologize. Onyer Steve.

      I am so pissed off with iprimus for making me sit on their tech-support line on hold for 30 minutes to be told in a few seconds how to fix the problem that was their fault that now all the cool stuff I was about to write about, like horse snot and humans with bird feet and oral sex on the freeway and ovary cloning, has dissolved. My forehead feels greasy. These twelve-and-a-half hour days when I go from my day job to my evening job are so utterly draining. The problem is, I drink a large bottle of coke to get through my nightshift at a market research agency, and the caffeine keeps me awake in spite of my weariness.  Cuzzybro called me today at work. It threw me a little. We haven't really spoken since two weekends ago: we broke up two weeks ago. Ah Cuzzy, bigsoft man, patient throatpoet. Sometimes I want to launch myself at your head with a canon and explode all over you, just to see you lose it for once. I want to make you angry.  We made a dinner date for Friday night. I told Amee tonight when I got home from work, as she hung upside-down on the couch with her feet up on the wall. "Yay!" she said, as best she could with her larynx all stretched, "and then you're gonna have sex!"  "No!" I retorted quickly. Paused. "Ok, probably. But I'm going to try not to." She'd just vocalized my own thoughts - the ones I had been trying to quell, the devil on my shoulder. I told her this. "You're like a bright red very noticeable tap-dancing devil fuckmonster oracle with blades and glitter falling out of your eyelids. Now I just  can't  ignore it." I wonder what will eventuate on Friday night. The unfortunate thing is, Cuzzy and I fuck  so well  that I don't know if I want to stop. I don't want to stop seeing him either. But I do. Usual story.  Ever had a brazillian wax? The discomfort and humiliation of having your pink bits splayed for a complete stranger is almost worth the result. Baby smooth, 100% Access All Areas. Cuzzy went at it like Homer at...a whole list of things.  Mmmmmmmm, pussssssssyyyyyyyyyy...   But I digress.  If anything does happen this blog is gonna be the first to know. Gempires is SO what I need right now - a place to rest my itchy brain warblings, and it has quickly found a very healthy chunk of my frontal lobe in which to nest. If nobody ever reads this it won't matter. There's something about personal blog that draws together journalism and autobiography / storytelling that I find thoroughly liberating.

      Expensive Cuzzy, I have thought on you for last week non-stop. He is only natural, later that all we had only broken above the tuesday before the last one. I hate that you if he did not call, but exactly more I hate that I do not feel I eat the call of you neither. Over all I want only to love it me with a passion that you feel in its bones and its teeth and its pregos of the finger of the foot and its lobe frontal and its liver and its spleen. Offends me that you can be thus nonchalant for me. Frankly, the fuck that, because this is gem you is neglecting here. I love you and you love me and that one is good sufficient. It calls me soon. It loves The Gem.

      As part of the Sydney Writer's Festival today I went and saw Salam, the famous Baghdad Blogger, speak to a packed hall about his country, his life, his sudden fame. The man is an inspiration. So at ease with the attention from the media and the international community, so nonchalant about his upcoming movie and his regular new column which he was invited to write for The Guardian. It almost seemed as if he had always expected his blog to generate the frenzy that it did.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, see  urlLink http://dear_raed.blogspot.com .  It's always good to see a regular Joe Hatstand thrust into unexpected notoriety. It's the Big Brother phenomenon - you start to think  that could be me , and you wonder how  you  would handle the sudden pressure. I would probably have recurring dreams of malicious microphones zooming at my face and vying for my attention, and during television interviews would be a mess of throat-clearing and nervous hair-fixing, and at live events would be overly conscious of how straight I would not be sitting, but Salam was delightfully composed and eloquent and just so  accessible . More than that - lovable. I've been reading the book and it's hardly possible to  not  come to love someone whose life you get to share. He is very generous with what he chooses to disclose. I wonder if his family keep his celebrity status a secret.  I am a walking dichotomy. I am sugar and salt, I am rocks and cotton, I am flowers and poo. By this I mean that I am easily delighted, but easily offended. Extraordinarily sensitive to my environment. It's my folly and my most appealing quality. I'll take the good with the bad.  For instance, yesterday when I arrived at my door having been to the supermarket a woman walked past, carrying a plastic bag. She stopped when she saw me and asked if I had a spare plastic bag as hers was heavy and breaking. "Sorry, I don't," I replied. She looked at the stacks of garbage and cardboard boxes that are piled up on our porch as a result of the recent move.  "Can I just have a sift through your garbage? I've got nowhere to live and I've got nuthin'." That was when I realised she was pinned. She moved into the gate and began to sift through the bin.  "No, look" I said, "there's nothing there. It's just rubbish." She was swaying and sort of falling into the front yard and I started to close the bin and tell her to leave. She started foraging desperately and took hold of a white plastic bag that was near the top of the bin, under a garbage bag.  "Aw look it's just a fuckin bag, whaddya want wif a bag? It's just a bag." She quickly left. I watched her stagger away with a bag that I knew to contain three shoes I had jettisoned.  Whatever .  That didn't upset me. What messed with my mind was leaving the house this morning and walking a few metres up the street and discovering my shoes - a black pair that I had loved but had gone all frungy - sitting on the footpath. It unsettled me greatly. I picked them up and put them in the nearest bin only to find the third shoe sitting in the middle of the street. An old thong sandle it was, and had lasted me two summers. There is something just so intrinsically intimate about a pair of old shoes that seeing them there on display was a gross violation of privacy. Maybe it's just me. I'd give them to a charity or sell them no problem, but I'd never leave them on the street. It was like seeing my feet there, sawn off at the ankles, discarded to rot into oblivion.  So that was the poo. Now for the flowers.  I had this beautiful moment with a leaf. You know how in Autumn the leaves go brown and then fall off the trees and you feel like being a K-Mart ad and running through them in a beanie and scarf and grabbing a pile and flinging them at your sister?...Anyway...I was walking down Bourke St when this leaf began to fall from way up above my head, revolving in tiny perfect circles like a crunchy brown ballerina, just spinning straight down toward me like it was being wound down a skinny pole. I stopped to watch it and smiled like a maniac and felt my heart grow bigger and squelch open and leak strawberry serotonin smoothie all over my lungs and ribs and out through my nostrils and navel and onto my toes. It came to rest on the ground right in front of my feet. I decided it was a good omen, and ceremoniously stepped on it and crunched it to bits, which might seem a little discordant with my leaf-loving ebullience, but it was more in recognition of my omen being only for me, and it needed to be sealed with a fate that was different to all the other leaves around it. Kind of like throwing someone's ashes to sea, or burning photos of your ex.  People say I'm easily impressed. That's ok. It's good to fall in love with a piece of dead foliage once in a while.

      ...this blogging thing, I mean - because when you first get started you're really keen and you want to do it every day and maybe even twice, but then, if the analogy proves me correct, the rest of your life resurfaces and you realise that somehow you don't have as much time for it as you would like. I can attest to this, having just joined a gym. I can only hope that I'm not giving myself enough credit and that I will actually maintain this burst of creative healthy energy.  It's all in the mind isn't it?  I shall maintain. I shall maintain.   It's a mild autumn night in Sydney tonight. Here in Surry Hills it was a gorgeous Saturday, the kind you want to step into like a warm bath and soak for a while. For me it was a series of short trips up the road, mostly to get food because having just moved here there isn't a fridge in my house. Our kitchen bench is hilarious, all strewn with wilting vegetables and half-full containers of hommous and greying avocadoes that all look a little forlorn, like lost puppies. Tonight Amee donned her maroon Kathmandu dress and cooked up a scrummy dessert of stewed apples and pears with cinnamon and pepitas and lime peel and cloves. The cinnamon looked like chunks of bark.   My current brain-train is heading toward Crisp Collared Shirts and Fawn Accessories, then all stations to Corporate Wardrobe. I've decided I need to start dressing like an adult in order to find a job that pays more. I'm a graduate for crying out loud. I'm capable of doing more than a basic office slash customer service slash merchandise representative job, or at least I can be paid more for same.   One day I will be my own boss.  I will work from home doing things I love.  I will continue to dye my hair red and black and wear skirts over the top of my trousers.  I will not owe anyone any money, and I will have enough to give away.  Simple goals. Very attainable. If I could just devise a plan and stick to it...

      It was really stupid of me. I wasn't my usual cautious self. I ran downstairs to answer the door when Cuzzy arrived, quickly minimised my blog's posting page so that he wouldn't be able to see it. Forgot I had the main page open behind it. We walked into my bedroom and there it was, splayed grotesquely on the screen like a porn movie on pause on a gynaecological close-up:  Gempires , like a giant billboard saying GEM'S PRIVATE LIFE HERE! FREE!!! He knew I had a blog. He didn't know anything else. "I didn't see anything!" he said as I gasped and rushed to hide the screen. To my horror when I minimised the blog, there was the Good Buddha website behind it which I had opened to check the URL in my link. I guess it looked like I was sitting there writing about my life and reading about him.   "I recommend you don't read that," I said, and meant it. I'm not going to change my blog. If Cuzzy chooses to find it online, that is Cuzzy's choice. He won't enjoy reading it. I suspect he wouldn't even go looking for it, since I suggested he shouldn't. He's like that.  So we had our "talk." After all the belly pains and painkillers I really wasn't in the mood but I guess it had to happen, so it did. It was like the final conversation. We won't be together again. His coolness was still prevalent, his aggravating agreeableness and absence of a contrary point of view bored me senseless, his "yeah I was sad but then I decided to get over it" comment made me sick to the core, and I was left wondering whether he would ever know the joy of real passion, and whether his music will be enough for him, as he seems to think it will. And I realised why he has an ability to have such intimate friendships with women that never cross the line into romance (except me, I tried) - he doesn't understand how it works. He was single for too long. No room for anyone else because he spent a great deal of his energy filling the space that a girlfriend should have filled, directed so much toward the practical things that are safe because he loves them and they don't need to love him back, like music, that they have become his everything and for (gasp) another human to impinge upon their rightful place, well it means his world becomes a little less predictable, and unpredictability is akin to peeling off his skin and rolling him in lemon juice.   But he's right that breaking up was the best thing for us. Had it gone any further there would have been bitterness that would taint our friendship. As it stands I think our friendship can pick up from the point where it changed, and become something even more beautiful, because we became as close as he allowed us to become, without ever having screamed at each other or snarled or disrespected one another in any way. On Thursday all I could think about was how much it hurt my pride that I barely left a dent in his life despite him being equally non-eventful in mine. It doesn't matter that I didn't fall in love with him; I wanted him to fall in love with me. A good night's sleep put it back into perspective. Now all I feel is bemused acceptance, that it was what it was, it has its place in each of our lives, and he's right - there is something wonderful and positive between us that can be restored now. Whatever we lost in the dynamic by being together can come back if it wants.   I love him like chocolate. Like a great comfort and friend that I love and crave. He's absurdly beautiful. Quality. He'll be in my life forever.  Bye Andy.

      I had an abortion in April. It wasn't an emotional experience for me at all like it is for some women. It wasn't like I had to toss up options or like the idea of removing a foetus is like killing a baby. Everyone has different reactions to the issue, and for me it was simply a medical procedure - something needed fixing, I got it fixed. It wasn't particularly unpleasant or difficult. I recovered normally and quickly, and that was that.  It takes quite a few weeks before you start having a period again. Mine started yesterday and stopped immediately: it does that sometimes, but today I had the worst abdomen cramps I've ever had over an extended period of time. It felt like a small man with big hands was inside my abdomen roughly stuffing a cat into the deepest part of my pelvis while his wife wrung my ovaries dry like wet laundry. I ate Nurofen Plus and Naprogesic all day while the dull pain just sat around, making my belly swollen to twice its size, and every time it threatened to cross the threshold from bearable to ridiculous I would swallow another pill, roughly once every hour. Now I know what concrete feels like when it's setting.  So I skipped the gym because it would have been unbearable and because I really wanted to hear the  urlLink Good Buddha   interview on Triple J ("Super Request") tonight. Cuzzy didn't say much. I heard his distinctive cough quite loudly in the background at one stage and I laughed. It's just like him to only say one or two things but they're the most salient part of the interview. Him and Glenn should have just done it by themselves; Al and Matt sounded like a couple of stoned teenagers. Actually it was one of the dumbest things I've heard on radio, this Good Buddha "interview". It consisted of a couple of lame questions c/o Maya Jupiter (no offence to her, she's a good lady) and then some "trivia" questions made up by the boys, all of which were incredibly obvious multiple choice deals, I mean,  sheeeet , I was quite disappointed.  You know, this piano jazz really is the best music to write by. I simply cannot write while listening to hiphop (does anyone else prefer to write it as one word? hip hop makes it look like something your mum doesn't understand) because I get too distracted by the lyrics. If you're into piano jazz as background music click  urlLink here . Same with any music with lyrics really because I'm such a word person and will often become sucked into a song via its lyrics way before I really consider what the music is like. Hence, I know the words verbatim to many a bad song. Lyrics come first. Melody is secondary.   It feels good to be sitting here drinking Smirnoff blacks with one slipper on - my right one - with that foot crossed beneath me on the chair, and the left slipper off so that my foot can sit up against the wall where it's cool. Interesting, having one warm foot and one cold foot.   Cuzzy is coming over after his "interview." He should be arriving soon. After I lost my cool (via email remember, brark brakark) on Tuesday we arranged to meet tonight, here at my place, to talk. Yes, talk. Boys will cringe and girls will nod in empathy. It's time to communicate, goddammit, and fuck, if I have to be the one to initiate it then so be it. I've come to realise that after months of sitting back with Cuzzy and refusing to be the one to do all the work in the relationship, that it is the woman's lot in life to harness the thing and guide it along, otherwise nothing happens and it's just sex and fizzle. Which he probably doesn't mind. Bit of sex and fizzle goes a long way for a man. For a woman, on a scale of head to toe, it stops just short of the nose.  I've been reading lots of blogs lately and I'm quite amazed by how many of the personal, diary-style blogs are negative and depressing in content. Is this our outlet, journal writing, for our dark sides? Is it that we keep these parts to ourselves and let them out only in private, or in pseudo-privacy? Is that why there is always a sinister side to personal writing? Most of us would consider ourselves to be reasonably happy. Studies have shown that people respond that way when asked about their overall mindset. I mean of course your mood at the time will govern your response, and your perspective on life will be different according to how things are going externally, but surprisingly most of us have an internal baseline of contentedness which is rarely confounded by the hardships we face. Only a very small percentage of the population would rate themselves as unhappy. So, why the fascination with despair? even I admit that reading someone's personal account of a life that seemed roses would bore me very quickly. I guess it's because there's nothing clandestine about happiness, no shame or embarrassment or need to hide it away. It's what goes on behind the scenes that grabs our attention, it's the stuff that we believe we wouldn't otherwise be privy to. This is what keeps us reading personal blogs, it's what leads us to pick up a perzine, it's why we're fascinated (perversely) by reality TV.  Well possibly until the very forseeable future I feel quite content in spite of my messy abdomen. Sorry to disappoint you.

      Home with feet walkage same black day shoes thinks of puppy with peripheral vision it could see both sides of the road at once and it breathed like a dustbuster with fuse issues and gummed my finger with happy, in a headthought what occurred was that oh! life can be fine sometimes and sometimes an anus with peppersting and tarblood, my abdomen was creaking to the right where the baby vacuum went too hard all those weeks ago, remember me in a daze and then she gave me biscuits and tea and then Cuzzy drove me home and read next to me on the bed until i woke up and bought me fruit and painkillers, think about him and sucking his glasses off his face and sitting on my bed in three different bedrooms in only seven or eight months there with his rollies, me with a wine glass blood red sitting cross-legged wanting to slice him open and let stuff bleed like spilt wine, a hand a thigh a closed eye a sigh...  Yesterday was am is of anger so, my throat grew fur and i growled, im is look at clouds and make pictures like mediocrity and boredom, sometimes he's too sensible and reliable and rational and reasonable and im want his nose to cave in and his handle to fly off. Tonight I'm sit in old comfies on my old chair with wheels, psychedelic flares and a pale blue dress and brown hoodie and of course slippers, my hair has slight damp and tummy still is of complaint.  I look at my pretty hands and get glad. The nails are short because I cut them to type more accurately. I dread old age and haemorrhoids and weak bladder and shaky voice. Wonder why I think such things at 26. At work I made cake happen, chocolate, and ate some and the wheat flour didn't seem to bother me. Wonder why I can't eat bread or weetbix without having mood swings but cake is ok. Wonder why each boy is a clone of the one before. Wonder why I haven't converted to lesbianism yet. Wonder why I'm still tired after 11 hours of sleep last night.  Is this what it's like to be half happy half sad? I really dig this piano jazz. Where did this new penchant for jazz music come from? Working for SBS, with their strange eclectic music collection. If you stayed, Cuzzy, I wouldn't sex you anyway - I'm in Non Touch Mode, that's why my belly hurts, and I have a herpe, there on my top lip, just a little one, so you couldn't kiss me - we could just roll and curl and spoon, just for warmth, just for dream-sharing. You and me in my bed, where we fit best, you and your big paws, me and my nice feet. I'd like to eat my way through your shell like a birthing rhino with its nose claw. Knock your wall down and trample it with acid feet so it turns to dust. Pry your gates apart and slither through like a jellymonster in a horror flick turned loose on the other side, the wrong side, to wreak havoc and change things forever. Too cool. Ice cold. Wonder which one of us is in denial.  And Gravy? When will you speak to me again? Like a missing toe you are. I feel you're gone but you had no purpose anyway. It makes no difference but I feel the loss just the same. Game of Operation - buzz, touch the sides. Oh, it's strange in the world sometimes.

      What do you do when you feel like this? When there's an avalanche of turd demons hurtling from your brain to your aorta to your toes, coating everything in a stinky fetid mess of wretched slime, and all you can feel is bitterness and rage...  The ex-boyfriend just got interesting.  I decided today to get fucking angry. For the first time, I told him exactly what I thought. Granted, it was an email - is that the chicken way out? Well brark brakark, pluck my feathers and feed me steroids. Let this be a lesson to all boys: when you break up with a girl and she needs to talk, you better act like that's an important thing, not some loose maybe scribble in the diary that can be toyed with and changed at will. Yeah, you need your space, you need to go hibernate and growl in your cave and rub your crotch in solitude, and if she's smart she will give you that, but when it's time to give back, you fucking GIVE AND GIVE AND GIVE boy, get down on your knees if it makes it seem more sincere. I am an extremely tolerant and reasonable and understanding and generous girlfriend, to my detriment, and to a point. There's only so much selflessness I can handle.  So it's a scorpio moon tonight. Gravy and I used to fight every scorpio moon - then laugh about it afterwards, because it was like clockwork. Everything is exacerbated on a scorpio moon and emotions go haywire, steam blows out of people's ears accompanied by whistle-like sound-effects, brains explode like boiling beef stew and hearts atrophy like ash scultpures. It's what I keep telling myself to calm myself down. That ordinarily I wouldn't wig out so extremely. But hell, it feels good to just get it out there for once. Though now I've glugged a Xanax I'm feeling kinda mellow...  I don't want this blog to be about relationships, ex or otherwise. I have better things to think about.  So I went to Darling Harbour on Saturday to see if I could check out the "talent" at the Australian Idol auditions and was disappointed to find that I needed a stamp to get into the official area, presumably for hopefuls and wannabes only. There were some hair-ironed clones milling about, and a couple of boys in baggy pants, and for some reason a Ronald McDonald standing next to a girl filling in paperwork (I nearly asked why, then thought it would sound stupid), but nothing of interest at all, so I sat by the water and read my book. I'm reading  urlLink Requiem For A Dream  by Hubert Selby Jr, who also wrote Last Exit To Brooklyn, and is a fine, fine author. I've been wanting to read it ever since I saw the movie. He has this great style of writing where all the dialogue and description is mixed in together - he doesn't use speech marks or anything to distinguish between separate characters talking, so you get this amazing natural flow where the characters are very much a part of their world, of the setting and the whole  feel  of it, though sometimes it's hard to tell who's talking. But I love it.  There's something in the air. It's breakup time. Have you ever noticed how couples all break up at once, like it suddenly occurs to everyone that they really should be single right about now, and fuckit, that's what I'm gonna do. Usually when it's getting cold. Then spring arrives and all these new couples come out of nowhere. I swear, it's all based around having someone there to shag when it's hot enough to wear mostly nothing mostly always.  I know I just said I don't want to go on about relationships but it's rather salient at the moment since I think me and Cuzzy just had our first official falling out, even though it involved me sending an email and him ignoring it, but I realised a couple of days ago, sitting on the toilet no less (the Great Throne of Philosophical Exploration) that although I'm not in love with him any more and he's in Japan and we don't even speak, I think about Gravy every single day, in some way or other. Of course sometimes it's with great contempt or loathing, sometimes regret, sometimes pure love and well-wishes. When you're with someone for four years I guess they become an indelible part of you. Lately I have been appreciating him a whole lot more. Realised how much of him I adored. Easy to forget that stuff when all the other shit gets in the way.  Don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you got till it's gone...

      It has begun.  Take the dolly from the child and she will squeal with anguish in decibels violent enough to rouse cadavers and her face will contort with torment, but leave her peacefully at play and she will soon discard the dolly and crawl to the nearest saucepan or pair of sunglasses or shoe or something equally mundane. She will play happily so long as the dolly is within her reach should she desire it.  Sex. Lack thereof. At work my day is spliced by extended fugues where I simply stare blankly into space, lost in fervent fantasy, to awake and find myself a) overfilling a bottle of water b) performing the same computer operation multiple times, needlessly c) dialling a book ISBN instead of a phone number and not quite registering the recorded protest advising me the number is not connected - several times in a row.  And of course it's always Cuzzy. He will dominate my fantasies for some time, and when the edges have worn smooth and the snags have been filed down after not having slept with him for an age, he will intermittently reappear to star in my mindsex, and I will wonder what it would be like to fuck him again.  What a blush he injects. Today, sitting there at my corner desk that is thankfully obscured from the rest of the office by a small screen, I repeatedly pressed my cool hands to my hot face - my burning cheeks and forehead and back to my cheeks; adjusted the vague half-smile that had goofily lodged itself on my lips and probably made me look lobotomised had anyone been watching. The daydreams would not stop. On constant replay was my favourite fantasy: the one where he lazily runs a finger from my toe up my foot and shin and thigh and feels me tremble and knows he has rendered me helpless despite my protests. He traces me all over and grins quietly to himself as he ignores my halfhearted requests for him to stop, while I helplessly recline on a chair, my body sinking further, pelvis creeping forward to where he sits on the bed in front of me, tightish polyester dress slinking further up my bare thighs, knees relaxing to the sides, and he just watches me with a detached curiosity as if performing some kind of experiment, barely registers my increasing breathlessness, manipulates me so lightly I can hardly accuse him of doing anything at all but somehow the voice of reason and consequence has become a mere squeak in the back of my consciousness that I block with the warm flood buzzing through my skin until I'm just  aching  between my legs and I know I'm powerless so I just succumb and soon he pulls at my dress fabric and everything is bare and I'm half lying on the chair and he has my legs up on the bed and the room is dark but glowing softly red and he still has that bemused half-smile, I can't resist and I move forward to baste it with my tongue and the heat of our mouths froths and burns and the breathing is all heavy and his clothes have disappeared and his finger finally grazes the fleshy part of my snatch and I suck sharply at the air, finger finds warm pussy and he probes me there and then leaves and probes my mouth and back to pussy and then it's fingers pussy mouth and I can't stop writhing and sex smell is all over the place and his cock finds my lips and pries them open and I taste it a little and then he says you wet bitch you're so ready to be fucked and   I moan and he whispers you can't have it and   i say no please give me and   he says no you can't have it oh fuck you're so sexy you fucking gorgeous woman and then he can't wait anymore and pushes and I'm oh god and he's oh god and in breath seems to go straight to my gut and he's so far inside me our bones are shaking and he pulls us to the wall and I'm against it and my back is cold and I say does it feel nice and he says oh god it's so good oh god I love fucking you and my legs are around his waist and he pounds me against the wall and...  And then it's the office and I am folding slips of paper and slipping novels into paper bags. Hands cool cheeks. Feel embarrassed, like everyone had heard what was going on inside my head. Tell myself to focus.  Tonight in the call centre I did a survey with a 35 year old man with a sexy voice. In my feverish state the reveries began again and as I mechanically performed the survey on autopilot and responded with flirtation to his voicy growls I pictured him sliding his cock from his pants: for some reason I imagined him as Wil Anderson in jeans and brown jacket, drawing it from his unzipped fly and greasing it with slide and skidding it all over my legs and belly and tits, but his voice was so incongruous because we were talking about internet so he would squelch his cock around inside me and pull me on top of him but he would be saying well we've been with the same internet company for about two years and i would swallow his pink shaft and he would say yes Gemma we might be getting broadband in the near future and the ridiculousness of it only made me hornier and he was one of those respondents who liked to say my name and sometimes you get this  I'm a guy and you're a girl and we're on the phone and we could be anyone  thing happening, and flirtation is inevitable, and you both feel like fucking by the end of it, and you can hear the hard-on in his voice.  Man, it's only been a couple of weeks...

      I can't go to the movies if it's a gorgeous sunny day. Movies are for evenings and grey weather. For someone like me who is somewhat bleak during the winter and ecstastic during summer, sunlight is warm yellow benevolent skycustard therapy and should be basked in at all given opportunities. Why then did I while away my Sunday in my bedroom online trying to rid my system of a worm? Because I am determined and stubborn and have much love and respect for my lovely little laptop. I emerged at 4:30 pm when the shadows were almost joined at the seams but still a tiny bit of sunshine wriggled through, and marched straight to the gym where my cramped limbs stairmastered to flexidom and my pores breathed and i sweated all the indoor-ness out. I nearly lost my mind. I know I talked to myself a lot. Some gibberish was spoke.  I still have the worm.  Today I woke up with this sinister  uh-oh  in my throat because I felt achy and dizzy and exhausted like I was coming down with flu (why do we "come down" with illnesses? Does that mean we start to operate at a lower level? Sounds strange now that I think of it) and I decided that I was going to be late for work. I dragged myself out of my nice warm bed where the doonas and pillows had fluffed about me and teased me by being sooooooo comfortable and hugged me with their chunky softness and pouted mockingly each time I tried to get up and pulled me back down with cheeky giggles and made me feel like stripping off and slipping naked into their warmth and...  Do I miss sex that much already?  Started work 40 minutes late and barely said a word to anyone all day, just sat there at my desk taking phone calls and culling shelves of books and processing other books and sending emails. When I have my flat days it seems as though the office is really quiet, and I'm enough of a narcissist to think that there is a distinct lack of energy when I'm not 100%, though it's probably more a case of me ignoring everything around me and feeling sorry for myself and not really noticing that things carry on as normal.  I really do like my fellow officeheads. I've never really worked in an office before and I find it fascinating the way people in a small office become like a little family, the office itself is at times a hub of confessions and revelations, always in between tasks there is the banter about girlfriends, boyfriends, beer, weekends, clothes, chocolate, nans, donuts, DJs, bands, rubber bands, ex-employees, flirtation, innuendo, customers... I'm debating whether I should collide worlds and invite them to our housewarming party.  Housewarming!!! This Saturday!!! Long weekend!!! I get the feeling it's gonna be big, hedonism spread all over the walls and floors like sticky diseased cordial-flavoured skank moss, drinks and naughties being passed from hand to hand (to mouth to foot to groin), music, debauchery, oh it shall be grand. There is a select bunch of people who I'm really looking forward to hanging out with - Elektra will be interesting because we've only just refried our friendship after a year of not speaking; Vince, who I haven't seen in an age, and hopefully he hasn't changed a bit (last time I saw him he told me he washes his dishes now. Not when we were living together though, the cunt); Dawkface who is such pleasureful sunny company without fail, oh how grand it is to fraternize with you my friend; and possibly the next door neighbours who we don't really know but it could be fun. And Jake, my newest favourite sweet nob. Classic, is that man.  There's a hurty in my spine. Last time it happened I got some acupuncture and it went away almost immediately. Yes, yes, I am susceptible to an unfortunate array of maladies. Somehow there is always something wrong with me. It's the curse of the virgo to wear the weight of the world on our shoulders and I guess the nit-picking and extreme pedanticism manifests in subtle physical atrophy.  urlLink Atrophy . God I love that word. It's really acute, hits hard, but slowly - like being winded by a heavy punching bag swinging at you from far away - says something, carries with it a wonderful subtext of gracefully imploding landscapes and avalanching boulders in slow-motion and small bones eroding in a glass of coke and bloodied organs dissolving casually in acid. But at the same time it has a regal dignity about it, it's so commanding and succinct - you can almost imagine its capital A as a tall soldier standing at ease with his arms folded with quiet authority. It's time to celebrate the word Atrophy. I'm about to write it in black texta on my left tit (upside-down, I just realised). It's a start.  Today Nath replied to the email I sent him. I told him how hard it is to see him on a downward spiral, trapped in his own irrational depression, how hard it is to hear him say that I'm not a good friend, that I don't call him enough, nobody calls, he says, I don't have anyone, and he flits erratically between saying how much his friends don't care and he thinks we should all go to hell, and how much he loves us so much that he can't leave Sydney and get out of his rut. I begged him to try medication. I told him that it has beome too big for him. That he needs help and he can't keep looking outside because nothing out there is enough to help him.  He said thankyou, I love you, you made me cry, I need to see you.  I don't feel like such a bad friend anymore.  The dog next-door came to our last party. We broke the fence so that one panel moves to the side and he can squeeze through. I named him Fish Tank, and the name stuck. We shall invite him over to the next one. Last time Amee went downstairs at one stage and everyone was out in the yard and Fish Tank was just hangin' in the kitchen looking for all the world like he should have had a beer and a cigarette.  Cigarette. Just made me think of Cuzzy. Sweet Cuzzy. Somehow you never ever tasted bad.

      I am a truly enlightened and infinitely wise woman. All the energy I have put into making myself a solid human being with the capacity for love and empathy and maturity has really paid off: over the past few weeks I have been congratulating myself on the way I handle the world. I'm being serious. No sarcasm here. Here no sarcasm.  It's all coming down to the pure and simple and elated love I now feel for Cuzzy, having established the parameters of our friendship, and surviving the ever-so-tiny spot of turbulence when we broke up. I do have an ability to be brutally honest with myself and to see the world for what it really is, and I clearly resented him for a little while because it hurt my pride that I never captured him like I felt I should have. It didn't matter that I felt the same way about him. All I wanted was for him to worship me and go gaga, but it never happened. It only took me a day to get over it. Now I can get on with loving the stunning human who can be my best friend again now that the fog has lifted.  Last night  urlLink Good Buddha   had their CD launch @Newtown RSL and it was THE best gig I have ever seen them play. The place was packed, there were people lined up outside who couldn't get in, the crowd stood up and headed straight for the dance floor before they had even started playing, the band were loving it and having a ball, the vibe was just amazing. I was watching Cuz and just thinking,  this is why you do it. This is where all that time goes, so you can reap the rewards onstage, and you fucking rock . Good on ya bro.   It's a really amazing feeling when you know you can just love someone no matter what, and forgive them where you feel they fall short, and your heart swells because of all the things that are amazing about them, and you know that you can let them go and watch them be with other people and they're still gonna be there. Cuz and I always said we'd be friends no matter what. We said the worst that could happen to us is that we would break up. Maybe it would take us a little while to find our feet again but we love each other enough to be committed to finding that path again. Magically, there is no struggle. On Thursday night we sat on my bed, smoking his rollies, me trying not to be too bitter or frustrated with his calmness, at the same time probably seeming very cool myself, and I said, "It won't be the same. I don't feel like it will ever be the same."   I still feel that way.  It's gonna be better.  I'm really excited about where we can go from here Cuzzy. With friends, the complicated stuff doesn't exist. Less expectation, less "get it right". I think we were meant to be friends. Not partners. Lovers, yes - dear God I will miss the sex.  Feels like a turning point in my life.  Love you honey.

      Dreams are so cool. How cool are dreams? You get to wake up from several movies you've just seen for free, all directed and produced effortlessly by you, often starring you, and maybe some of your friends / vague acquaintances / people you haven't thought about for years.  Last night I dreamt I bought Jonnie's motorbike from him for $400. Haggled down from $500. I spent the rest of the dream effortlessly cruising around on this bike with the wind in my hair, turning this way and that. I even did a preliminary bike course to learn how to ride, which took like five minutes. Jonnie and I rode to the beach, which was this big beautiful summery wet rockery-with-secret-places, a vast espanse of flat sand and waveless ocean, and even a backyard party (?), and I was driving Cuzzybro on the back as my passenger. I commented on how different it felt to have someone on the back (something Jonnie used to say often when we were zipping around South East Asia on a bike together), and asked him not to move suddenly, and to "lean in with me when we turn" (another Jonnie quote). So Cuzzy is wearing this hot ensemble - it's a black suit with black and white pinstripe jacket/blazer, a white shirt, a black hat and dark sunnies. He should have been wielding a saxophone, or even better - a gun. It was the kind of look that would really suit him.  So we're zooming around and we park at this beach and leave the bikes so we can frolic, return to find the bike has been stolen. There's this little shit of a kid wandering around and we are very suss on him even though he says he didn't see anything. Eventually we catch him with our bike as he goes for a joyride right back to where he stole it from, dumb kid, and we realise in the meantime he's also stolen a heap of other shit from our bags. I reclaim two sets of hair clippers, a big mangy stuffed goose toy, and a child's cotton tent printed with red animals which I immediately set up.   I was struck by a bolt of nostalgia at this point, remembering the cotton tent my sister and I used to adore when we were little. We would set this thing up in the backyard and have picnics in it, consisting of chopped cabanossi and sticks of cheese, and my own invention - balls of margarine rolled in icing sugar. I figured that when you cream margarine and sugar when you make cakes, that shit taste gooood, so it must taste gooood if you just coat chunks of it in the sugar. Luckily I took one bite and nearly hurled.  So back to this dream. It takes on a bit of a morbid twist here. Cruising at that rocky beach, we come across a friend of mine; the same one who starred in my erotic dream the other night (see blog entry "Erotic Dreams..."), let's call him Arnold. Arnold turns up looking slightly distressed, and I said "hey Arnold, you ok?", and Arnold just collapses against one of the big rocky walls and starts screaming and wailing in anguish, and he's so fucking  angry  it's spilling out all over tha place and making  me  feel mad and upset and panicked, cos I know something really bad has happened to my friend, and I say "Hey, hey, it's ok, what happened?" Between his sobs Arnold grits his teeth and this moan croaks out of him and it's half-defeated but half saturated with all the anger in the entire world, and he says "They raped me."  My dream goes into this tangential sequence, like a movie showing the scene being described that hasn't yet been shown to the audience. I don't see who's doing it or what is really happening, I just see Arnold struggling and trying to get away, the fear and loathing and hatred and rage on his face. The scene returns to him crouching in front of me, leaning his back against a beach rock, crying and screaming like someone stuck their hand straight into his gut and is squeezing and pulling and scratching at all his soft bits, sometimes arching his head to the sky as if pleading, sometimes covering his face with his hands, and I think to myself,  the world is so wrong.   But poor Arnold, I seem to get over his trauma pretty damn quick and just leave him there sobbing as I zoom off on my bike. Soon I'm in Coles buying flat thong-shaped coconuts to grate onto my cereal, and a small container of olives, which I loathe, and I encounter two girls from high school: Kristy and Amanda, who I've not thought about in years. Kristy says "what's your name again?"   "Gem."  "Oh yeah, Gem! We were really close!"  "Yeah!" We weren't at all.   We discover we all live on the same street. Kristy lives at number 30, right down the other end; Amanda lives at number 560, which is just near me but somehow right next-door to Kristy. Kristy is a part-time nurse now, and Amanda is a photographer who takes photos of the walls inside her house and has a successful business selling these photos. I ride my bike a bit more. The end.  Freud? Jung?  I have been a little concerned by the content of my writing for a long time now. Well concerned is a little strong: I've pondered the reason for much of my writing having a scatological or sexual flavour. This morning I woke up thinking  I must write a story about a horrible ageing punk mother called Ma Petrie who always fights with her equally horrible punk son called Bruce The Gun and it culminates with her screaming "you little bastard!" and reaching into her pants and lifting a leg and squelching all around in there looking for a choice deposit and bringing a jubie little ball of cunt sludge out on the tip of her finger and chasing him with it around the house.  I mean, why do I find that so entertaining?  More to the point, why is it suddenly raining outside when I've just finished a load of washing that needs to dry and it was promisingly sunny and breezy an hour ago? MY GOD! MY GLASS IS HALF FULL! I COULD HAVE ALREADY HUNG OUT MY WASHING AND IT COULD BE DANGLING THERE GETTING WETTER AS WE SPEAK! AND I'M INSIDE, WITH THE HEATER ON, WITH TWO DVDS TO WATCH! It's lovely when you realise you're complaining for no reason and the very thing you're complaining about is actually quite cool. What say I make me some honeycomb tea and maybe a veggie sausage wrapped in lettuce with some avocado and hommous and sesame seeds? Fukn yum.

      My "California Boy" called late last nite (see blog entry: "Creepy SMS"). He said "sorry if my text was confusing. I had to confess my attraction to you. And I'm like leaving in like five days, maybe we could have some tea?" I told him we could hang out as friends. After all, he's a nice guy, he's just going about trying to get a root all wrong. He said "that's cool." Emphasis on the cool. Poor Marty.

      Well it seems that suddenly Gempires has taken off and, my god, people are actually reading it! Congrats to you all, what fine taste in time waste you have! Actually it's a little confronting considering I had absolutely convinced myself that nobody would spit on another 20-something-Sydney-female-undergoingquarterlifecrisis-with-illness blog if it was on fire, but my site stats say otherwise. Yay...I think. As long as nobody shows it to my mum...  So this was meant to be my first day back at work after spending all week in bed having a grand old time apart from feeling like shit. I got up. I showered. I assembled appropriate attire. I exited. I walked. I bought banana bread for breakfast. I chanted my morning mantra:  I do not feel like poo I do not feel like poo I do NOT feel like poo . I felt like poo. I called my boss from Oxford St. I said nope, can't do it. He understood. He's really a great guy, my boss, who I like to call Dre Bro (to myself: it's an abbrev of his first and last names), when he's not calling me when I feel sick to tell me mundane things about medical certificates.  Incidentally, why do I need one if I'm not getting sick pay? I have no sick pay. I have already been sick too many times. Ironically, I never made it to the doctor to get one because I felt too sick. Does this mean I get a red mark against my name?  No! God No! Anything but that!!!   So here I am again. Guess you'll be hearing from me at various points during the day. This blog is actually becoming quite obsessive for me and has taken over from the small books I carry with me everywhere to scribble various brainal nibblies - instead I mentally write things in my blog and purge later.  Does anyone else crack their backs too often?  I decided today that I would document everything I do for the entire day. Pity I'm not actually going to  do  anything but I guess that means it's more of a challenge to make it sound interesting. I will also re-insert myself into the driver's seat of the Vitamin Vehicle riding the Road to Recovery, which is a tricky and inelegant metaphor meaning I shall now look after my health. Since we moved to Surry Hills and spent nearly a month without as fridge I got into the habit of eating out and haven't quite recaptured my culinary zeal. As in, I've cooked a)lentil soup b)potato and leek soup c)cups of tea. Today I will make a nice buckwheat noodle soup with tofu and green vegies and tamari. Sustenance permitting. Yes I am vegetarian. Yes I kill cockroaches, mice, anything else unappealing.   In one of my sharehouses we had a bad mouse problem. The fuckers were everywhere, and confusingly, they were kind of sweet looking, so tiny, like furry grey cockroaches (which would NOT be cute, but you get how small they were), and they would dart across the room in quite a charming way, and we really didn't mind them until we would go into the kitchen and there would be crumby little poo balls everywhere and holes chewed in cereal boxes and the whole place would be squeaking and stinking of this awful nesty stale procreating musty tang. So we did our best to ignore it for as long as we could - we were like that: Rene, Simon and I, until one morning I put some bread in the toaster and pressed the lever and began to notice the mice were particularly loud this morning in fact if I'm not mistaken one of them is screaming, squealing in anguish, and whatever could possibly be happening to the wretched creature he sounds like he's being burned at the stake, and isn't it funny that while I'm thinking this I swear I can smell burning, and look at that there's a lot of smoke coming out of the toaster oops the bread must be stuck let me just...  ...deal with the fact that I just toasted a fucking mouse to death and its charred carcass is now stuck at the bottom of my toaster and I think I'm gonna spew...  I left the mouse where it was with a note for the flatmate. I didn't know what else to do. They sensibly threw it in the bin. At least it was cremated.  Another time a little baby one got stuck to these organic enviro toxin-free cockroach traps we were using - we also had a roach plague (you get that living behind a cafe in Newtown)- which were simply sticky paper traps with a bait tablet stuck to the middle. The roaches crawl onto the trap to get at the bait, get stuck, and slowly die of...being stuck. So you get this crunchy auburn perimeter of dumb roaches all stuck to the very edge where the sticky stuff begins, then it's time for team two. Team two climb over the pitiful wasteland of their starving broken brethren, many of whom have lost limbs in the struggle to become unstuck, and create the next layer of stupidly marooned beasts too greedy to learn their lesson from the first generation who by now are reduced to sporadic desperate undulations of antennae, like white flags of surrender. You can almost hear the dirge.  My point is, once we found a mouse stuck to one of these traps. On its side. A baby roach or two dotted the otherwise clean new trap like empathy suicide allies. We felt so sorry for the thing that we spent a good half hour carefully lifting the little grey beast from the sticky enviro hippie free-range-corpse trap, follicle by follicle, ugly little toe by (oops, our fault) crippled mangled wrist. Eventually we freed it and it hobbled across the yard in a daze, probably to breed and spew forth more pestering beasts to invade our unhygienic plagued wasteland of a kitchen.  We also once found a poo on our doorstep. This poo was fucking huge. We were pretty sure it was human. It hadn't been done elsewhere and then picked up and placed there, it had been freshly de-anus'd right there, against our door, so that when we opened it the shit smeared everywhere and really showed its true colours. They had also smeared some around the keyhole in a disturbing metaphorical emulation of their own arsehole. We think it was the lesbians next door. We kept them up at night. We left it there for a couple of weeks, all waiting for someone else to take care of it. Eventually Rene's mother was coming over so Rene cleaned it. Good on ya Rex.  This scatalogical diatribe has rendered me quite shitty.

      Feel sad. Maybe it's the solitude. Maybe it's the moon. Maybe it's The Nothing.

      Just got this txt msg in three parts from Marteezy, the guy from San Francisco who I met on the Street who came to my party and crashed out on the couch. I believe my quote was "I think he's keen." Here it is verbatim:  hello from your california boy who came to your party. i want to see you and am curious if kissable because i am. maybe i can prepare myself into a living art exibition [sic] of pause & movement, like the picture on your wall, as your subject object project. it would be nice cuz alone & together, we are. you are an avatar!  The "picture on my wall" he's referring to is of a big penis head.  a)what the fuck? b)huh? c)nope.  Nice guy but hey, that is like so the opposite of my style, exemplified to perfection.

      Would you believe I feel worse today? Is this the flu or some reality TV experiment gone awry? Either way, I AM NOT AMUSED. Yesterday afternoon I was quite perky and walking around as if nothing much had ever happened, like I hadn't been under a doona for two whole days, watching DVDs, eating chocomolate biskimits (Amee brought me Chewy Choc Fudge Tim Tams cos I had wicked cravings, bless her everloving bringageness) - possibly a bad idea, and suddenly at 2am I was woken by the Slug-Squid Squadron I had only yesterday thanked the universe for sparing me from. That is, I got Snot. It has gone again today but has been replaced by a strange dizziness and general feeling of fuckedness that is rather like someone stuck a valve in my ear and drained my head of some stuff right behind the eyes and now I'm seeing and hearing everything through this miasma of...nothing. The big evil Nothing in the Neverending story.   We were watching the Neverending Story last Sunday night, Rex and I, after 8 hours at the pub, still drinking beers we were (farkin chairmpions), and I told her how the idea of The Nothing had permeated my small spongelike mind at that early age and became my first experience with philosophy: one that would stay with me even now, when I return to it unconsciously in moments of determined frustration. I used to think, "how could there be just  nothing?  There's no such thing as nothing. I mean, what does it look like  ? Can't they describe it any better? Was it all black? But black is  something , and so is white, so it can't have looked like a big fog, so was it just space? But space is  something , and it's  black  too..." And around and around I would go. At the time it was exasperated, miserable frustration aimed at the producers of the movie who in my mind just didn't think hard enough about what they were portraying to the children, and took the easy way out in never showing us the "nothing" but merely having those who had witnessed it describe it, annoyingly, as "just nothing." But years later, studying philosophy at Uni and The World of Ideas and other useless crap, I came to realize that the idea of the Nothing was my greatest philosophical journey to date, and quite Buddhist at its core. It's still something I return to when I feel like having a think, and it still blows my mind.  More to the point it blows my mind that as humans we are so poorly equipped to understand  anything  beyond the scope of our own experience, even a seemingly simple idea like "nothing". To grasp it we must first picture what was there before, what was around the "nothing" for us to comprehend there is "nothing" there now.  And the philosophical hound chases its tail in ever flustered rabid circles.  It's almost surprising that I didn't persist with philosophy in Uni, given that I like to spend my time wandering around in a lobotomised daze restlessly thinking about useless shit. Until you consider that Uni soon drains the fun out of all brilliant ideas. Studying philosophy at Macquarie was like being given a list of all the great thinkers and being asked to write their names in reverse, in wingdings, arrange them anti-alphabetically, and report on how this subversion applies to their original ideas. It was stifling and mundane and limiting and irrelevant and I lost interest tres speediamo. Plus Western philosophy is generally speaking a jumbo load of extraneous beard-stroking redundancies that are cool to ponder for a tutorial or two but beyond that they aren't going to change the world. Except the one inside your head. Which could be cool, depending on who you are.  All this thinking sometimes means I sit quietly and just let my head take me where it wants. I guess sometimes people would say I'm quiet. But fuck it's loud inside my head.  I love this shameless narcissism. I get to sit here prattling about myself to nobody because nobody really reads this (except maybe  urlLink David , thanx for the linkup David, what a top bloke) and it doesn't fucking matter. Incidentally David at Metal City has a truly wonderful blog, and thus far the only one I've deemed worthy of sticking in my links section. Hey, I spent a good twenty minutes figuring out just how to stick a link in my blog just for  urlLink Metal City , cos it's that good. This dude is seriously entertaining. Big props David!!!  So this morning after I'd made the obligatory trek downstairs to call in sick via voice message (I make sure I make the call before the boss is in cos geez I hate talking to ANYONE when I'm sick, let alone the boss [ let alone ? What the fuck does that mean anyway]), I crawled rhapsodically back into bed and fell into some very vivid and memorable dreams:  1. There was the pregnant woman with the umbilical cord on the  outside , and this thing was super super long, and it had been rolled up at the other end into a huge coil that looked like a gigantic Frankfurt, and at the very end it was attached to a bulbous machine that looked a lot like Shaun Tan's   urlLink Lost Thing  . She was happily standing in a large excited crowd who were cheering like it was some kind of festival, because she was about to get this Brobdingnagian fucking tube measured to see if it was a world record. All of a sudden the machine starts - it's a measuring machine - and it kind of shoots a plastic sheath right up the spiral of the umbilical cord all the way to her belly button, like a straw wrapper with centimeters and meters marked out on it. It kind of looked like those party blowers that uncoil and honk when you blow them, and then roll back up. So we measure this thing and it's 11 meters something. Then it's all over and everyone's going home but that isn't good enough for me, the eternal virgo, I have to understand the details. "But how come it's on the outside of you?" I asked her. "Normally they're on the inside and they come out through the vagina. Did they pull it out of your navel?"  She looked at me like I was crazy. "I don't know, it just went that way."  2. A very angry old man kept trying to bust in on me while I was in a public toilet and demanded I get off and let him use it. I would hold the door shut while he tried to break it down while, eerily, two Asian girls stood silently next to me while I pissed, like guards. This dream kept recurring in between others and it got very violent at times, I was kicking the shit out of this old fucker, who looked not unlike Jonny Knoxville (oh,  porn  is that man) when he's made up like an old man in Jackass. I felt intensely furious and very hard done by.  3. I watched  In The Cut  last night - Meg Ryan movie, nothing too special - and there was a scene where a guy was getting a blow job, and you see quite explicit detail of mouth-on-cock for a couple of seconds. I guess it led to this erotic dream about one of my friends, who I'm not really attracted to at all, though we did pash once. I was all over him in spite of his ever-so-half-arsed utterings of reticence because of his girlfriend. I like this girl, but I was feeling extremely naughty and knew that his resistance was futile and I was all wiggly and giggly and eventually found his dick, mammoth it was, like a misshapen forearm, and went at it like some drooling manga slut, then fucked him like I'd been imprisoned in a glass chamber for weeks and forced to watch continuous live erotica and then released. Afterwards his guilt was getting to him. He phoned his girlfriend from the bed and just started having a conversation with her. The plan was for him to say "Yeah nah I just went out for some drinks and then crashed" but somehow it came out as "Um I slept with Gemma last night" and we both just sat there scared shitless going "Oh fuck", and there was silence from her but then she just started screaming, and I'm thinking "You  idiot " and then it ended.  Couldn't I have had a  nice  erotic dream?  Not that I would ever do that to a friend.  Finished my Tim Tams.  Cuzzy just called and invited me to lunch. Love to Cuz, can you bring it to Surry Hills with some wine?  Missed him like crazy last night. It's the enforced solitude. Wanted to call him to chat. Decided he wouldn't be home. Went to bed. Keep having to talk myself out of giving in and just fucking the boy. I bet he wouldn't say no.  Actually I've decided to try and be a lesbian now. It might work out.

      Relapse into LaLaLand, lovely laptop languishing on my lap here in my comfy bed while I try not to think about my aches and pains. I do have one thing to be thankful for: no snot. This flu could have been much worse - I could have been feeling like a large army of tiny workmen brandishing pickaxes and jackhammers had slipped surreptitiously through one of my orifices, chain-gang style, and proceeded to bash and hammer the fuck out of my bones and marrow and tender bits, AND like a haggis of slimy entities, let's say slugs and tapeworms and maybe a large squid, had simultaneously become lodged in my nasal passages and agreed to slow eviction, but only very gradually over a very long period of time. But I only have to deal with the chain gang. No sign of the slug-squid squadron. Small mercies.  Last night I inadvertently stumbled upon a poetry program on  urlLink 2SER FM , and it alerted me to the soft spot in my heart I have for poetry. It's a bit of a lone interest, this poetry thing, because none of my friends are really into words in the same way that I am. I've dragged many a companion along to the poetry night at the  urlLink Friend In Hand Hotel  in Sydney and they are entertained for an evening but rarely compelled to go back with the same frequency that I am. I love watching how others put words and sounds together, the themes they choose to explore, the vast scope for exploration and the diversity of format and structure, and absence thereof. I've come to the conclusion that even bad poetry is good poetry because it's an expression of another human's insides, and I can sit captivated watching someone making an absolute goose of themselves in daring to get up and perform a tragic mess of wordfuckery, but for me it's about transgressing the horror of badly written or badly performed shite and merely appreciating that their insides are spilling out. I think about poetry (and I'm mostly talking about performance poetry: written poetry  has  to be decent or I will not give it the time of day) in the same way that I know Cuzzy and other musicians think about music. It's a wonderful, limitless forum for absolute free expression, it's something that lets us be essentially  human , lifts us out of the ordinary and into the extraordinary, and is so intrinsically personal and unique in that no two humans will ever produce the same thing.   In one of my writing classes at Uni a teacher once said to me, "Am I wrong in thinking you write a lot of poetry? Your style is very poetic, very dense language and the symbolism is beautiful."  Confused, I replied "I never write poetry." It was only later that I realised that my "secret language" that I employ in my diaries so as to maintain privacy, and the extended pieces of creative prose that I like to call "blather", could quite easily be passed off as poetry - at least, because the term itself is so inherently elastic. I began to write that way in high school, quite unconsciously, to hide certain truths from my sister who I knew had somehow found the key to my carefully locked and hidden diary, and read all my secrets. I knew this from reading about it in hers. Ah, the irony. The wonderful thing about it is that I can look back on those diaries now and still know exactly what I was talking about. Words. Language. So thrilling.  I sometimes wonder what the fuck people do when they don't read books. What I mean is, I have a few friends who just never read books, and I truly don't understand it, and I know I'm operating from a solipsistic viewpoint here, but it feels to me like there should be some gaping cavern in their lives to have come this far and never found the simple joy of literature. One of these people is at the moment chronically depressed and lost and floundering and feels that there is nothing in life for him at all. Perhaps I should rest my case.   I feel that if you read - and even more, if you write - you are never alone in the world. You have yourself. If you don't have yourself, you have nothing.

      Know what sux? When you spend forty minutes typing a blog about feverish sickness and codeine and sweaty beds and shaking limbs and walking like an astronaut and feeling like your head is a hairy bowl of bloody sundae and like you're an organ doner who's had her vitals prematurely ripped out and your darling flatmate who brings you a bowl of vegies and rice and the poetry show on 2SER and how poetry is a magical elastic limitless expression of creativity and how bad poetry is still good poetry by nature of its entertaining tragicness and how your nine hours of trapped-in-a-bed were saturated with graphic sexual reveries all confusedly intermingled with hallucinated fantasies of getting dressed and going up the street for some Indian takeway, and some dickhead downstairs unplugs the modem for no apparent reason and your blog disappears, just like that, as if it never existed in the first place. Few things make me more upset than losing a chunk of writing.   I want a chocolate biscuit and Cuz on my bed with his legs crossed.

      Tuesday, bed, flu, feel like shit, feel like I've just turned 85, feel like someone blew into my ear and their breath just stayed in there making my head all fat, feel strangely elated that my condition has led me to pull my laptop over to the bed and surf the net with it sitting on a pillow on my lap. To me this is one of the greatest things in the world: to have cyberworld at your fingertips while you're reclining amidst pillows and doonas and the world is at work and everything's quiet except the mellifluous clackety knocks of your fingertips dancing over the keyboard.  I don't blame my poor body for wigging out. I abused its immune resources shamefully over the weekend. I ate very little, drank very much, slept not at all...and all the rest. I mean I thought I caught up on the sleep factor having gone to bed at midnight on Sunday and sleeping until 3pm Monday (oh the shame), last night was tucked in at 9:30, but during the night I woke to find the marrow in my bones churning and going grey, my whole body aching, feeling hot and cold, and I thought, uh-oh, here it comes. Called in sick and left a message with Ronnie to tell the boss I had the flu, knowing full well that he would call me between 10:30 and 11 to say something dumb or other. I love my boss, but this habit he has is particularly annoying. "Hi Gem, I got your message, just calling to let you know that you need a doctor's certificate if you have a day off after a public holiday."  "Even though I'm not getting paid?" I have used up all my sick days, and now I just miss out on pay and deal with being broke.  "Yeah, I checked up on that, we need one regardless." I told him I would try, knowing full-well that it's just not gonna happen. I'm in bed here, too fucked to walk up the street and buy some food (I'm starving) or some Neurofen (I ran out) and I'm struggling to sit here on my bed and type, and they want me to walk to the doctors and wait there for an hour so I can hand in something that proves I was legitimately sick. Fuck that, what are you gonna do guys? Tell me that I'm not your best friend anymore? Fire me? No skin off my flaps.  The reason I end up having so many sick days is that I'm not cut out for full time work. That continous malevolent cycle of five days on, two days off, simply does not fit in with my logic or my programming. I'm much better suited to casual work where I can choose to work 12 hour days and have one or two more days off because a full day off to me means  so much  - these are the days when I find myself again, when I tear myself away from the mundane loop I feel so caught up in just to pay the rent and the bills, and instead spend the day writing and creating and remembering what life is really about for me. It's killing me, working eight hours a day five days a week in a job that ultimately pays me in exchange for my time. I feel like a whore. Anyone got a job for someone who loves to write, read and surf the internet? Hello?  There is a penis on my wall. It's a photo I cut from a book of photography called "Naked Men" and it's a perfect frontal shot of the head of a penis so that you're looking straight down the eye. Cuzzy hates it, Rene hates it, in fact I think everyone is a little disturbed about it but me - I think it's art, such a perfect round glossy thing, and it makes me think of putting my mouth around one every time I look at it. It's black and white, of course. Full colour would just be crass and might as well have been ripped from a sleazy porn mag.  Ohw, my aching self.  I'm fading here. I'm going back to supine.

      Ah, housewarmings. An assortment of your favourite people gathered in your home slurring laughing falling hugging ashing smoking singing talking yelling getting high...It's Monday and the flatmates and I are wondering where the fuck the weekend has eloped to. Dawn arrived on Sunday morning with hardly a howdy and somehow it was 9am and the highest of us were squeezed into Amee and Joe's big room with the balcony, passing pipes and spliffs and bottles of water to ease our grazed throats, mopping up the spills, rolling in the stink of wet carpet beer, while some of us sat in Rene's room giving and getting massages, talking about Osiris and information technology and social taboos, and some of us sat in my room on my bed passing around a copy of Allen Carr's  Easy Way to Stop Smoking  and asking what happened to so-and-so I thought they were coming and fetish mistresses and nailing testicles to blocks of wood. I sat back while the human traffic came in and out, glad to be sprawled on my soft bed while people opened and closed my door for visits and pop-ins, grateful that two of my favourite people: Tits and Cuzzy, had finally met each other and were waxing lyrical about Big Brother and Tit's older married boyfriend and Tit's naked bungee jump and everything that is fabulous about Tits. She said that her conversations with me are always about her. Because I'm a good listener and I will let her say anything. I said, as always, "it's because you're facinating." Top quality young wench she is: twenty going on thirty-five. Her maturity is astonishing. She insists she bypassed adolescence and fell straight into adulthood.  And then it was just Cuzzy and me. The cacophany of voices from the next room as drunken revellers sprawled and ranted and squealed made me reluctant to stay there in my room, a big part of me was thinking  I'm missing the best part of the party where legs arms eyes groins armpits waltz and splay in delightful putrid salmagundi , but only a tray of Pina Coladas and eight or ten neatly arranged lines of quality cocaine proffered by a stunning naked black woman with big round arse and stallion thighs could have moved me from that quiet haven where he and I sat alone in easy conversation, with not a spit-dribble of awkwardness between us, simply chilling. Those moments to me are so precious and seldom that I prolong them for as long as I possibly can. I don't remember what was said now. It didn't matter.  I made him go downstairs and raid the fridge for alcohol and he found the only can of vodka that was left. I went to the bathroom and returned half expecting him to have gone to Amee's room where the kids were all chillin, half expecting him to be putting his shoes on and leaving, but there he was lying back on my bed, and I thought,  wow, I think he likes it in here with me , and it gave me great hope for our friendship, and replaced the dreaded feeling of impending doom that had manifested last Thursday when I had a drink with him after work, when he had been distant and aloof, and I was distressed enough to think it might take more time than I thought, and that I had been naive in thinking we could slip straight back into easy friendship.  I still maintain simple optimism. I'm still open to the idea that I'm being naive.   Then he reached for me from his supine position there on the bed and pulled me in for a hug and I just  melted  into him like hot chocolate on a waffle and rested my face against his neck and he squeezed tight. I drew back but he pulled my face to his and I planted a quick warm kiss on his lips and left it at that, him smiling because we both knew what we wanted to do and that I wasn't going to let it happen. That's what I love about Cuzzy - all the complicated stuff is only confounding if you let it get to you. We know how to laugh about pain, because ultimately in the scope of this enormous complex universe our tiny struggles are as significant as a crumb of eggshell in a vat of liquid concrete. It's the people in this world who know what's not important (everything) who I respect and invite into my life forever.  I used to think Gravy was one of them. That's why it hurt so much when he left, and told me I would never be a part of his life again. I thought he was above that. I told him to re-think that decision for his own benefit. Long-term resentment makes people sick. Now I feel sorry for him. His call.  So amidst the hugging and smiling and joking and the wonderful frankness, the honesty, the real shit, Cuzzy's fingers would go wandering, and I would laugh and slap them away, and he would half apologize, and immediately try somewhere else, cheeky cunt, and in spite of my former resolve I began to fantasize about his hands all over me, his mouth, the way he whispers to me and calls me beautiful, and I would snap myself out of it and find his hand creeping up my dress, down my pants, finding the wettest part, drawing a sharp breath when he felt how excited I was, me laughing and pushing him away, him watching me with that wry smile, and then we sould simply lie there and chat some more.  "Funny, this life," I said. "We both want to indulge in a simple act of pleasure but a few little words and boundaries means that we can't. Our brains know what to do and our bodies just ignore it."  "You came out with a gem last time. You said the future is irrelevant because it's not our domain. All we can do is run with the moment and have faith that we can deal with whatever the future dishes up." I did say that. I still think it's true. The moment would have happened had I felt like being deserted as soon as it was over. I'm nobody's whore. Especially when I'm not getting paid.  So I stood to hug him when he'd put on his shoes and when we hug it's the safest place in the world, all wrapped up in lots of man, and he kissed me and I kissed him back and it was fervent and urgent and he spun me around and kissed my neck and his breathing was hungry and his hands slid up to my tits and I giggled and said you're so naughty and his hand went to my pants with an insistance I didn't care to resist and rubbed my pussy like it was the only place in the world that existed and he was sucking my neck and right then the universe was comprised of our two bodies and nothing else existed and he was fingering me, so slowly but with such deliberation and intensity and I was hopeless and merely writhed and moaned and began to stray messily down the road of Willpower Gone and we stopped, breathless. I fixed my clothes and sat on the bed, laughing with exasperation. He said, "think of me" I returned his gorgeous smile.  "See ya Cuz." He left.  Downstairs the floor was grimy and sticky, beer bottles proliferated like some booze menagerie, we made cups of tea and sat around being maggot. I discovered Marteezy asleep in the front room. I had met him on the street on Saturday, an American backpacker from San Francisco, and he had arrived an hour early and stayed all night with no grog or anything else, just some whacky ideas about Mayan astrology and a penchant for carrots which I fed him at various parts in the night because I also am liking a good carrot these days. He is strangely shy but simultaneously very sociable and seems to pick up friends randomly and consistently like other people collect street press or groceries. He called the next day when Rene and I were still at the pub (where we had been for eight hours, who fast forwarded time?) and asked if he could see me again that night. I wouldn't have minded but the absence of sleep and food and too much beer was taking its toll. I think he's keen. Fascinating character, does nothing for me at all.  Eight hours in the pub. From midday till 8pm. I didn't notice the sunshine slip into dark. I moved from the couch to the bar to the toilet to the couch and nowhere else. Sunday evening trivia started, Rene and I lost, at one point the teams had to make paper planes and see whose could fly the furthest. Something in the back of my mind asked 'is this for real' when Rene stood up and flew her plane, which she'd called "Cafe Rene", which was nothing more than an A4 piece of paper folded once lengthways and then folded lengthways again. It didn't even have a nose. The trivia host called it a "hammerhead plane." She launched it and it fell straight onto the table of people immediately in front of the stage. I was beyond laughter, I just sat there agog, trashed and feeling like a dissected cadaver in a lab, in silent hysterics somewhere in between my ears because my mouth and larynx had ceased to communicate with my brain. Trivia came and went and our money had dried up so we sat for another hour yacking about what wonderful women we are and how the fuck do people survive when they don't try to understand other's points of view and how come some people are just selfish and too dumb to notice that they're going about things all wrong and man if you're having a hard time dealing with life you should try to work on being a better person and it all just falls into place and yeah how good are we I mean we're only twentysomething and we've come so far and we know so much about life and the world and we're not too arrogant to realise it's an ongoing process and wisdom is simply taking on board what life has to offer and knowing it's not fair and just getting the most out of everything it dishes out and ultimately, it's having faith that you'll be ok in the end. You will be ok in the end. That's really all you need to know.

      NB: Steve_Sucks_Llamas shall now be known as Thirsty_Elephant. It's because of the way he laughs. Like in school when you're trying not to laugh and you do that scrambled throat-nose noise because you're smothering the laugh and it ends up sounding like you're churning up a golly. It makes me think of an elephant thirstily sucking the last drops of water from a bucket with its snout. I mean its trunk.   Elephants are so fucking cool. Think about it: these giant ancient creatures have noses that double as hands. Imagine what humans would look like if we had an arm growing out of our face and nostrils on our fingers.  HAHAHAHAHA . Oh, I laugh me so.  Last night at the pub with Thirsty_Elephant I realised just how easily amused I really am when I confessed to him how rubber bands flying through the office still make me laugh. "I mean, whenever one lands on my desk it takes on this organic quality and I can't help thinking of it like a little rubber beast looking up at me with cheeky triumph as if to say,  hehe, wasn't expectin' THAT was ya?  They sail through the air like airborne fish popping from stunt cannons and you can almost hear them going WHEEEEEEEE!!! I try not to laugh cos common sense tells me it's really not that funny but in my little corner I sometimes hyperventilate with giggles." Thirsty_Elephant gave me a funny look and an uncertain Thirsty Elephant snort.  "You've got problems," he reported. I nodded enthusiastically. My Grandad used to say I would laugh at a swinging gate.   This was the first time Thirsty and I had ventured to the pub, just the two of us. I went on the premise that I could afford one beer and one beer only. Thirsty, who hadn't taken an entire week off work and was therefore not dead broke and who relishes a good drinking session, was in Legendary Top Shit Champion mode and bought me drink after drink after drink. At the point where the slurs set in Thirsty got confidential and dribbled secrets out:  a) The reason Ronnie has been so uncharacteristically quiet and distant at work all week is that he's pregnant. Via his wife Grace. They got married just a few months ago. Ronnie's only 23. Ronnie's a tad freaked out. Ronnie is leaving us in two weeks. Ronnie is the best guy in the world. I said "If Ronnie leaves, I'm leaving." Thirsty said, "Thanks a lot."  b) The reason Whaleboy is moving from the city to a cheaper suburb is to find a bigger place because he is also preggers. Via his wife Hayley. Whaleboy is 35 if you carbon date him but he acts like he's 19. Whaleboy is also a tad freaked out. Whaleboy is a balmy pom who likes to drink and play pool and bat objects around the office. Whaleboy would most probably never feel ready for fatherhood so I guess he might as well just go for it.  c) "I'm perverted." "No you're not, Thirsty. You'd like to think you are." "You don't know me Gem." "Ok, lay it on me. What's your filthy secret?" He paused. "I go to swingers clubs." "Oh my god, you fuck middle-aged married women?" He nods slowly. "And nobody knows. It's in the vault. I feel fine telling you, I feel like I can tell you anything, cos I know what you're like." I break into hollers of gutsy laughter. "What the fuck do you mean,  you know what I'm like?  Do you mean I'm perverted?" He nods again. I roar. I don't know what gave him that idea.  After six hours of empty-stomach boozing we stumble from the pub and I stagger homewards, vaguely recall buying two felafels on the way, enjoying the maggotry of Oxford Street on a Friday night, colourful retards vomiting and gyrating their way through the evening, the smell of hard cock and techno sweat everywhere. Amee and Joe are fraternizing in the kitchen and we spend a couple of hours in hysterics about nothing as Joe slowly gets stoned on a joint rolled in cognac flavoured papers, and Amee grinds her jaw post-nose-candy, and I drink cups of caramel tea in an attempt to be less hammered when I go to bed. Amee suddenly grabs armfuls of ingredients from the cupboard and whips up some maple oat cookies that look like Jabba the Hut when she piles them onto the tray. She bakes them and we sit eating warm cookies and spraying crumbs from our mouths. Joe leaves a pile of crumbs on one of the chairs, and mid-conversation he reaches out and picks the biggest crumb up and eats it, and I dissolve into hysterics, weak at the knees.  "You ate the biggest crumb and left the others!" The pair of them scoff at my amusement, which escalates further when I reassess what I'm laughing at, and soon I'm choking and heaving. I must have laughed for seven minutes at Joe and his crumb.  At 6:30 am I was roused from my drunken slumber by the phone ringing downstairs. My first confused thought was "it must be Gravy, calling from Japan to say he got my email." Sometimes it feels like he's dead, like when you think you see your Grandad or your childhood friend or Kurt Cobain on the street, and then you remember, hey, can't be: they're dead. My second thought was "it must be Rex, she's probly locked out." Correct. I toppled downstairs to let her in and slurred "now don't say I don't love ya." She giggled.  "Are you drunk?"  "Yeah probly."  Tonight's dinner: Mexi-beans, lettuce and guacamole. Wearing: Blue checkout chick dress and pinstripe flares. Listening: Choice Radio Hip-Hop. Craving: Pizza, as usual. And sex. Excited about: Being in the driver's seat. Ah, life: it's funny.

       Meeting with Boss Dre Bro regarding my sick leave wasn't so bad. Apparently I've had a total of fifteen sick days in the past six months, ie. three weeks all up. The synopsis goes a little something like this:   &nbsp;   "Gem, too sick, too much. Why sick? Anything we can do? Need certificates in future. Air con being fixed. Know you've had a bad run, what with the sore back and wisdom tooth and abortion and flu...take care of youself yeah?"   &nbsp;   To which I replied, in summary:   &nbsp;   "Yeah sorry Dre Bro, had a bad run, what with the back and the tooth and the foetus and the snot, think the air con is killing me, think I need to go part time. I'm a writer, I'm creative, I got a brain, I need to look elsewhere cos the tedium will be the death of me."   &nbsp;   So hopefully soon I will have Mondays off. And I am taking six days leave in two weeks to get my life in order. And Boss Gay Dre Bro really is a very reasonable and cool dude and I am a serial sick-day-taker. Not without reason of course, but it has been a little over the top of late.   &nbsp;   How boring. Jobs, guidelines, rules, regulations, monotony. What the fuck am I doing?   &nbsp;   Why do I have such a fetish for men in glasses, on a completely unrelated note? I cannot look past a man in specs. There's just something so  GODDAMN!  about them that makes me squirm in juicy anticipation whenever they cross my path. Oh, specs.   &nbsp;   Discovering how to post to Gempires from my email account is kind of dangerous. It means I can post at work without worrying that R2 Sweetu will find my blog by sneak-peeking at the history pages on my puter. Is this the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end? I don't know, but avocado sure makes homemade fried rice and sunflower seeds taste better.   &nbsp;   Saw many ugly poodles in a book today that was imaginatively called "Poodles" and one looked like the ugliest babboon that ever got borned. I called it "Stately Brown the Fabio Babboon." Another had a do that made it look like a romance writer, golden fringe all swept up and piled high on its crown.   &nbsp;   I believe that feminists should not protest about social pressure to remove body hair because it is acceptable on men and therefore unfair. Rather, we should promote equal pressure on men so we can all enjoy a fuzz-free existence. I myself have no extraneous body hair and would wax my eyebrows if others started doing it first. I hate those fucking things, eyebrows. Mine that is. They need to shrivel and die or at least turn into useful wishing ports that I can comb thrice and chant an incantation in order to be driven around in a pumpkin and have houses drop from the sky onto the heads of unsavoury people and lay golden eggs. That would be cool. I want magic eyebrows.   &nbsp;    Where Did I Come From?    1984 - year one.   &nbsp;   "Mum, does making love mean kissing?"   Mum hesitated. "Nnnooo..."   "What does making love mean?"   She hesitated again. "Um, kissing."   The next day she bought me "Where did I come from?" I read it with my friend Kate Thomas. We thought  semen  was the funniest word ever, and took to nudging each other and whispering "semen" and giggling hysterically. The next day in class I yelled it to her across the classroom. "KATE! SEMEN!!!" We collapsed with gleeful guffaws thinking it was our secret discovery and no way would our teacher know what we were on about. Miss Breeze with the Giant Brown Perm looked up and raised an eyebrow quizzically, and I remember thinking,  Ha! She's probly wondering what we're talking about.    &nbsp;   Don't know why I just rememberd that.   		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink New and Improved Yahoo! Mail  - 100MB free storage!

       Boss Dre Bro just said to me, "Gem I need to have a meeting with you. It's about your sick leave. I've organised a room upstairs for us. Is midday ok for you?"   &nbsp;   "Sure" I said, thinking, what? Cos I didn't get a med certificate for being off work for a week? Even though I didn't get paid? Meeting? Secret room? What what what?   &nbsp;   If this turns nasty I shall quit immediately.   &nbsp;   Poodles are the fairy floss of the pet world.   		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink New and Improved Yahoo!

       After the fabulous White Tit dream (see blog below), I had another dream about Gravy. Last time he infiltrated my dreams I emailed him the synopsis and of course he didn't reply, and most likely never read it, but strangely I will still email this one to him, for reasons I don't fully understand myself. I know I think in boxes and categories - everything has its place, and sometimes if my thoughts don't end up being shunted at the spot where it feels like they should go, they hang around like poltergeists and cause mischief until I dispose of them properly. I always tell people when I have dreams about them, so dreams about Gravy are emailed to Gravy and that is that.   &nbsp;   This time, he had returned from Japan and was living in Sydney again, and had been doing so for six months before I realised he was back. He was married to a gorgeous woman with cropped white-blonde hair, and she had a small child, I think a boy, who was half Indonesian, obviously from a previous partner of hers. Gravy was still working in the sound industry but had progressed from Sound Engineer to some kind of stand-around-with-arms-folded-and-observe Boss guy. His younger brother Steven was standing next to him, grown up into a man, looking like an exact replica of Gravy, except he also had white-blonde hair in contrast to Gravy's dirty blonde. Gravy had his dreadlocks again, and Steven had an identical mop snaking from his own head.   &nbsp;   I observed them standing there at whatever event they were managing, both with arms folded, serious faces, intently watching the stage and nodding along to the music. I kept trying to call out to Gravy but it wasn't coming out of my throat, but I knew he knew I was there, and he wouldn't look in my direction. Steven turned to me and said something dismissive and angry, and Gravy walked away silently under the guise of doing something important closer to the stage. I screamed at Steven, "tell your brother he sucks!" Scene dissolves.   &nbsp;   Now I'm sitting on a manicured lawn with Gravy and his wife and we are looking at four small children's books that I have brought as presents for his step-child. As at the gig, Gravy is quiet and withdrawn, and I sensed an overwhelming defeat in him, like he had taken on board something huge and dark that had killed whatever spark was in him, and he was quietly resigned to an unhappy but bearable life. His wife and he seemed to have a bored but comfortable air between them, as if they had simply been allocated to each other in some kind of destiny lotto. Nothing about this bothered me, but I felt distinctly curious as to what had happened to him in Japan to have made him so different.   &nbsp;   End dream.   &nbsp;   Some of that is too telling and overtly symbolic for words.

       After drinks with Tits last night I had another lovely strange dream.    She said to me, "ever been to Rookwood Cemetery at night, to the toilet there? It's fucking freaky, but it's worth it."    So of course, we went. It was dark and extremely scary but Tits, as always, was cool as a cucumber, smoking a cigarette and clomping about in her trademark stilettos as if we were taking a stroll by the beach rather than hopping and skipping over broken graves in the dead of night. We arrived at the toilet cubicle which was a run-down little shack made of bricks, with a smaller room the size of an outhouse in which was the actual dunny. In the main part of the room there was a desk set up with a phone, a morse code transmitter, and a laptop. In a corner of the ceiling was a small security camera which Tits pointed at when I asked her why the laptop hadn't been stolen. In the eerie red glow of the room, we checked our emails, since obviously that was why there was a functioning net-connected laptop in an open public toilet in a cemetery in the night. When I went to use the toilet, I noticed that it was really low - about half the height of a normal toilet, and it was filled with a  tar-black liquid rather than water. For some reason&nbsp; this black stuff scared the cheeses out of me and I knew that if I was to rise to the challenge of braving this adventure, that black stuff was what I had to conquer.   I sat. The walls were covered in excellent graffiti and pictures and scribblings; a direct reference to the pub Tits and I went to last night: the Labor Club in Surry Hills, which has a very funky, deserted lounge section upstairs with cool stuff drawn all over the toilets. As I sat on the low loo trying not to think about the murky liquid beneath my nethers, I remembered what Tits had said to me before we set off for Rookwood:   "Don't forget to play White Tit. It's the best version you'll find."   So I looked around at the walls for this "White Tit" game that Tits had raved about that was simply the best thing to occupy one's mind while doing one's business. I soon found it. Essentially, it was a picture of a cirle with a dot on the inside - a boob with a nipple - and underneath it was another oval, meant to look like a toilet seat. The aim was to come up with some mathematical answer to the question "fifty?" Don't even try to figure that out.   So I sat there playing "White Tit" and eventually solved the puzzle and felt immensely satisfied and grateful to Tits for showing me this amazing place. My fears about the whole toilet/night/cemetery/freaky black dunny water vanished. Dream ends.   		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink Yahoo! Mail  - 50x more storage than other providers!

      Mr Ford,  The Platypus is a  special  brand of almost-but-not-quite mammal known as a Monotreme, because it lays eggs. Adam (the other Adam) refuses to accept baby mum-licking platypuses as evidence that whales do not have tits, and is too busy losing himself in elaborate plankton-embossed fish-tit fantasies where bulbous glistening creatures with breasts and blowholes undulate sensually through wet stuff. I thought it was a good piece of info myself. I shall suggest it to him again later, when he's finished downloading "Whalesong".  If you're reading this and you don't know what I'm talking about, see Adam F's comment to previous blog.

      -  Tom Robbins, probably "Jitterbug Perfume"   Well, you know. People fuck. It's something about the colour pink - it only goes with pink. You can't wear pink with anything except jeans (didn't your mother tell you that jeans go with everything?), and other shades of pink. Hence, one's pink bits have one compulsion and one compulsion only and that is to seek out other pink bits with which to meld and belong.   I knew he was drunk. I didn't know he would sleep with me and have no memory of it afterwards.  I should have tweaked at the point where he was slapping my arse and calling me a dirty slut. Now, I  like  dirty talk. Sex with Cuzzy is often a whispered cacophany of wicked expletives:  tell me how it feels do you like that oh god your pussy is so ready to be fucked you hot bitch im going to fuck you slowly just the way you like it is that nice is that good do you want my cock...  But halfway through this rocky ride I snapped out of some kind of trance and thought, huh? Am I fucking my drunk ex-boyfriend? Did he just slap my arse? Does he know my name?  And I decided it was all over. And he coaxed for a long time afterwards. And it wasn't going to happen. And for a day I was extremely hurt and extremely angry and determined not to show it.   And as usual, with Cuzzy, I was over it in a day.  And I don't feel like a semen saddle anymore. In fact, I don't feel much of anything anymore, and I welcome that.  In the morning Cuzzy tore the blanket off because he was hot and I stood there dressing for work staring longingly at his naked flesh, his cock all hard and huge and pink, looking like he had strapped a raw turkey to his waist, and I couldn't resist kneeling on the bed and dragging my tongue up his shaft, several times, so that he sucked sharply at the air and began to press his pelvis toward me in sleepy undulations, and I plugged it into my lips and moaned, and he frowned and his lips fell open and he sighed loudly...  ...  Just back from drinks with Tits at the pub where we larynxed about the tangled purple pubus that is her life. Her married boyfriend, who is twice her age, recently left his wife for her, and in a bizarre random  somehow  of happenings, the wife turned up at Tit's Kung Fu class on Monday. By the end of the class each had realised who the other was. Unfortunately for Tits that moment happened to fall at the point where she was sitting in underpants in the change room. When she SMS'd me about it I vomited laughter till my throat imploded. Ah Tits, who would entertain me were it not for you?  The catchcry I invented for the office today was "Steve sucks Llamas." It came about via the following progression of inanity:  Adam: "Is there any other kind of milk you can get, besides cow and goat?" (brief silence)  Me: "Yeah, you can get pig's milk."  Adam: "Pig's milk? Really? I've never heard of that!"  Me (suppressing laughter): "Haven't you seen it in the gourmet section at the supermarket? You can get turtle milk as well."  Adam: "Turtle milk? My god. How do you milk a turtle?"  Me: "I'm surprised you haven't seen it yet." (pause, laughs raucously) "Adam, I can't believe how gullible you are."  (Adam goes red)  Steve: "Llamas. You can milk Llamas."  Me: "How do you know Steve? Have you tried? With your mouth? Is it nice? You freaky Llama tit sucking milk pervert. Steve sucks Llamas."  Adam: "What about whales. Whales are mammals, can you milk a whale?"  Me: "Have you ever seen a whale with tits?"  Adam: "But they're mammals. They must have tits."  Me: "What's the definition of a mammal? 'Has tits' ?"  Adam: "Something like that, isn't it?"  Me: "Are you a mammal? Do you have tits?"  (Adam proceeds to google "Whale Tits", convinced they breastfeed their young.)  Ah, the boys at the office. They've taken to playing a game I like to call "balls" when the boss is out of the office, which consists of removing the mouse balls and rolling them, lawn-bowls style, at a pin stuck in the carpet, aiming to get their ball closest to the mark. Today I remarked, "you know, when boys are together under minimal supervision they will inevitably invent a game with whatever objects are lying around, preferably balls, and it will quickly become more complex with rules and challenges." At one stage they placed a desk chair on top of the pin and began to slowly rotate it so that it was like a windmill in a game of mini-golf. I pondered the evolutionary significance of this propensity in males for the rest of the afternoon.  I came up with the best nickname for Sweetu: R2 Sweetu.  Oh! I never mentioned my brilliant call! This was one of those moments where you just come out with the best thing ever and try to make everyone worship you and your great call for the rest of the day and they reluctantly comply until they get sick of it. Steve and Adam were bantering, and Adam said, "Steve, are you sticking it in my inbox?"  And I say -   Wait for it -   "Boys, please. It's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve."  Applause please. How good am I?  Granted, at the time I had forgotten that their names actually  are  Adam and Steve, and was merely regurgitating that fine homophobic Catholic maxim, but then realised the subconscious genious of it when the boys capsized with eye-watering braying, and I was deservingly lauded for my fine effort. Bored offices are the KY of the forty-hour working week sphincter. The great thing about it is that we are  so  bored sometimes that we're amused by very little. I could sit in my corner and say 'bum' and people would laugh. Actually I laugh whenever I hear the word 'bum', bad example.  David, still haven't started reading part two. Shall soon. Wish I was sick again, there's so much time to read when you're confined to a bed.

      One has to laugh out loud. Flying biscuits, pigs fucking pineapples, retarded pie-eating men with football-shaped heads, small humans that fit in one's pocket, shoes that smell like petrol, broom and dishcloth cheesecake...imagine everything that is bizarre and makes no sense, and there you have it: Cuzzy in my bed.  Accidentally. After the Good Buddha gig in Adelaide last night it seems they headed from the airport to the pub this morning. By the time I got there at 5pm Cuzzy was hilariously maggot, slurring loudly and doing quaint pirouettes to disguise his lack of balance. We headed to Newtown RSL for the  urlLink TZU  gig but he faded well before they arrived and we got a taxi to my place. "Make sure I get home" he said. I laughed. I laughed all the way home.  Ah Cuzzy, daft floppy drunken rock star.   "You're so beautiful. I love you. Gem, so beautiful. Oh god, so beautiful."  "You need to tell me when you're not drunk."  "I know. So drunk. I love you when mmm I'm I am sober...an I love you...when I am Drunkkkkkxxxxzzzz..."  Now he's snoozing peacefully, dead to the world.

      They truly are. Yesterday's dream inspiration re Ma Petrie and Bruce The Gun (see blog entry "More Cool Dreams") has turned into a short story. Last night (or early this morning)I had a sudden stroke of what my semi-sleeping self thought was genius, but in the light of day it's actually very lame, and therefore funny. I thought, I  must write an article about Britney Spears and call it " Britney's Beers ."  I distinctly remember a surge of excitement as I anticipated how much attention such a killer headline would attract. Not sure what I thought it was gonna be about.   "Take a Tour of Pop Sensation's Home Brew Workshop" ?   "New Beer Flavours To Have Face of Pop Sensation on Label" ?  "Pop Sensation Disrobes and Collapses After Two Beers" ?  When I woke up and rubbed the crunchy granola from my eyes it came back to me in a flash, and I was half beside myself with laughter and half disappointed. Was that  it ?  That  was my big idea? What about Britney's Peers - an article about all the Britney Wannabes? Or Britney's Beard? Now it's just getting weird.  Britney's Pears?  I'm having such lively and memorable dreams lately. Presumably because I've had the luxury of waking up and then going straight back to sleep. Dreams are important to me. I've had a couple in the past that have actually changed my life because they showed me things I had been avoiding in my conscious mind. When you're asleep and the dream factory starts churning you're pretty much strapped to your seat with nowhere else to look. I was forced to look at a couple of things overnight, and woke up thinking,  of course. Ive known that all along. Now I can get on with my life.    What's with these people popping up who I haven't thought about in years? Last night one dream featured Natalie, who I haven't seen since primary school, and she looked exactly the same with her long wavy blonde hair - just bigger, and dressed in corporate clothing. We talked about money and how much she must be making in order to have saved up $50,000 in three months, and she said, yeah, I get paid quite a bit. Never found out what she actually does. Damn.  But the best bit was when I went waterskiing in my slippers. My wonderful, warm, faithful, fluffy, animal-print boot slippers. I was a shit hot waterskiier too. Wow, sporty action dreams. Am I the next Angelina Jolie?  You wish.

       We nearly cancelled the whole dinner party plan for tonight. Amee and I stood in the kitchen last night going over the people we had invited, soon realising we were going to have to somehow feed twenty of our wonderful but hardly-worth-that-much-frigging-effort friends. Amee, in her lovely red buckle shoes, thoughtfully stared at the wall, considering the option of bread, hommous and booze, as opposed to the morrocan stew and herbed rice we had planned.   &nbsp;   "I really don't feel like cooking tonight," I whined, knowing that the bulk of it would have to be done ahead of time. I was heading to the gym and balked at the thought of shopping at coles, returning home to cook rice and chop things and mix them into salads and do other ungodly exhausting things in order to feed twenty other people.   &nbsp;   "Neither do I" she replied. At the height of our reticence our dinner party became a BYO snacks party. It very nearly stopped at a big bowl of popcorn. But we relented in the end: after all, Amee had bought $50 worth of yummy things with which to brew up a huge pot of spiced casserole. I decided my input would involve cooking enough rice to make the stew go far enough to feed the troops. We agreed on a plan of action. I scuttled off to bounce vigorously on a stairmaster.   &nbsp;   By 10pm I'd steamed two kilos of brown rice in veggie stock, toasted some sunflower and sesame seeds, and stirred the lot together into two massive bowls kindly supplied by Amee's big brother. Surprisingly, my simple dish turned out to be a promisingly tasty accompaniment, to which shall be added a few select herbs this evening for flavour. Ah, civilised gatherings. Our teeth shall be stained mulberry by the cab sav and our surfaces shall be scattered with the refuse of the drunk and fed. Nobody will get laid unfortunately, but that happens.   &nbsp;   Next monday and tuesday Boss_Dre_Bro will be on leave because he is moving house. Wozzle will be here on monday which means we sort of have to half-behave, but tuesday is supervisor-free day, even though technically Whaleboy gets paid extra because he is the "assistant manager/superviser." He spends most of his time on internet chat rooms and googling "whale tits" and giving R2 Sweetu electric shocks and is not a super-anything by any stretch of the he-man-gyration. I proposed that tuesday shall therefore be Drunk Day.   &nbsp;   "We should get a six-pack each. We'll start at midday."   &nbsp;   "Why don't we just get a case between us?" said Thirsty, jumping and sputtering with excitement at my capital idea.   &nbsp;   "Capital idea!" I replied, slapping him on the back. The boys are keen. Excitement is brewing in this here bored office. Tuesday shall be Drunk Day and a grand time shall be had by all. Hope nobody complicated with a strong accent and/or speech impediment calls me to order some dodgy SBS CD to be sent to their unborn cousin in Istanbenon to be paid with via direct debit in a slot machine in Osaka because I'll be too maggot to cope. Sometimes I shamelessly put the loonier customers on the speaker phone so that the rest of the office can hear them. I had a guy today:   &nbsp;   "Aw, hoi, I was watchin' the...the TV, and I heard a song. Do you have, um, cassettes?"   &nbsp;   "No, CDs only I'm sorry."   &nbsp;   "What's that? Is that like a record?"   &nbsp;   "They're compact disks. You need a CD player."   &nbsp;   "Can they go like in the tape player in yer car?"   &nbsp;   "No, you need a CD player."   &nbsp;   "Aw. Well I heard this song, do you have it - it goes:    La la, Angel woman, lalala... ? "   &nbsp;   I don't hide the fact that I'm cracking up. I put him on speakerphone, and the office stops to listen.   &nbsp;   "Um, I don't think so. How does it go again?"   &nbsp;   He obliges, sounding rather lobotomised, and sort of in detached pain, like he was being walked on by heavy people in sharp heels but given nitrous oxide at the same time.   &nbsp;   Sometimes my job is hysterical.

      This  urlLink latest Harry Potter merchandise  has come to our attention here at the Dymcocks Online office. Apparently the new Nimbus 2000 vibrating broomsticks are proving too exciting for teenage girls who are running the batteries low like crazed duracel-hungry sluts. Wozzle wondered aloud whether Toys R Us in Moore Park would be stocking them. This is because Wozzle is a perverted gay man and therefore very cool.  So I called Toys R Us at Moore Park.  "Hi, do you guys stock the vibrating Harry Potter Broomstick?"  "Hold please." I held.  "Hello, Toys R Us, Miles speaking?"  "Hi, I'm after one of the vibrating Harry Potter broomsticks. Will you guys be selling them?" (Smothered giggles in the office)  "No, I'm sorry, we don't have those."  "Oh. That's a shame. I really wanted one. Do you have any other vibrating Harry Potter merchandise?" (Uproarious laughter)  The gentleman paused. I sensed him trying to assess whether I was serious. My innocent tone betrayed nought.  "I'm afraid not. We have figurines and dress up clothes, that sort of thing, but nothing in your vibrating action I'm afraid."  At this I yodelled like a panicking goose, and he lost his composure for a delightful thirty seconds as we both chuckled down the phone to each other, two strangers laughing at fuck-all. I thanked him and hung up. Life is so delightful.

       This is getting ridiculous. I'm sitting in my little corner of the office, divided by a low screen from the boys, validating cheques and money orders with the autopilot division of my frontal lobe or cerebral cortex or whatever part of the brain is designated to tedious endeavours, while that large chunk that houses fantasies and mysteries is happily concocting wet reveries which largely revolve around me being fucked ruthlessly against a wall. Several people have had the privilege of groin-grinding gyrations this morning, fictionally speaking: Cuzzy of course takes the starring role, while a couple of men who I have been pleased to adapt into my filthy daydreams of late have also made welcome appearances. Some women burst in on occasion. Then there is the token fuckbuddy who I simply invent, comprised of bits and pieces of former (and future if I can swing it) lovers, primed for my personal use, adapted and improved to my tastes.   &nbsp;   It's difficult to maintain composure being rampantly horny in a small room full of men, throbbing at the crotch and tongue, fully clothed and helpless.

      Oh, and that whole boob-squeeze scenario below reminds me of the time I was talking to Dean about his ex-girlfriend Bianca's huge double-D cup breasts, and he was telling me how she wouldn't let him go near them when she had her period. "They would swell up and get all tight," he reminisced, "like big ripe melons, and I would look at them and go, OH GOD THEY"RE SO RIPE AND..." Here he made squeezing motions with his hands as if pretending to be a lion with big claws. "If I tried to touch them she'd just scream."  I have a weird thing with brushing my teeth. I cannot let anyone see me do it. It makes me very uncomfortable to brush my teeth in front of anyone, and I cannot watch other people do it, and I don't understand why ads for toothpaste show people shamelessly in the act - to me it is akin to prime-time TV showing a naked man playing air-guitar on his genitals. It makes me feel ill.  I also can't stand to be nudged. I mean, with an elbow. There's something terrifying about elbows (well, more like really really annoying), and I can't even tolerate the action of nudging. My friends sometimes taunt me just by elbowing the air next to them or pretending to  nearly  elbow me without actually touching me, and I find it seriously disturbing.  This is because I am seriously disturbed.  Another thing I was thinking about on my way home from work, walking through Hyde Park all dark with the lovely lights in the trees overhead, is the whole six-degrees of separation thing. I mean, referring in part to the blog entry below, David found my blog then I found his, I found Adam's site which led me to Tim's and Vanessa's - separately, not realizing they knew each other, and that Vanessa knows Adam, and then on a tangent Adam found David's site, possibly through mine, which led me to conclude that Adam, being the common denominator in this lovely unfolding of connections that gave me thought-fodder all the way home, is one of those special people known as a Maven. A Maven is simply a person with magical fingers in many pies and who have an ability to draw people together. The theory is expounded in a fascinating book called  urlLink  The Tipping Point   by Malcolm Gladwell, and it investigates the ways in which trends and crazes are spread, positing that the emerging of zeitgeists are less about chain-reaction chinese-whisper domino-effect, and more like a radial pulse where a message is spread via a few key people to a massive group of people. Incidentally if you buy this book online at Dymcocks by clicking that link and put "Gem Is Cool" in the promo field I will personally process your order and shall include a post-it with an authentic hand-drawn smiley face and a bookmark. Not that I am some kind of Dymcocks promotional tool, I would just get a real kick from seeing "Gem Is Cool" on someone's order, because my job is tedious and I am easily amused.  Adam, are you a prophet?  Yes, I am shamelessly flattering you so that you send me a free copy of  urlLink  Man Bites Dog  .   Just kidding. I ordered it in today. But someday I'll be in Melbourne and I'm claiming that pot / pint of beer. Pint.  There used to be a man in Newtown who went everywhere with his poodle, and he would be wearing a white t-shirt that he had had made, and on it was a photo of his poodle. That, my friends, is what life is all about.

      I have adopted what I now consider to be my Writing Pose. In my bedroom, on my chair with my right foot tucked beneath me and the left on the floor, wearing (of course) my fluffy leopard fur slipper boots, my pale blue dress, some psychedelic flares (oh, remnants), with my heater on and internet radio jazz playing. A visit from the menses fairy means that my tits are delightfully swollen today like a couple of volcanic coconuts and I took the liberty of staring at them in my mirror while standing side-on, because my tightish stretchy night-dress has this way of hugging my boobs just right so that my gripples look all tweakish and high-beamy, and it is more satisfying to stare at one's tits on a day when they are looking relatively large. Sometimes, as I did just now, I grab each breast in my hands and hold them like fruits and imagine what they feel like to another person; envisage the pleasure they bring to men when they cup them and squeeze them. It's sort of a mystery that I half understand. To me they're just lumpy sacks of flesh but I guess men wouldn't really understand the wonderful euphoria I feel at the sight of a nice arm at the point where the t-shirt sleeve ends. That is my favourite part of men's bodies.  Mmmmmm, t-shirt sleeve end point...   I was thinking today about how much I write about sex in my blog, and wondering whether people who read it get the impression that I'm a little bit salacious or  perverted even. I'm not. I treat this blog like my diary and made a personal pact to be intensely honest here, purely for the experiment of revealing highly intimate details about myself with interested strangers. The most fascinating reads for me are always character-focused, whether it be fiction or blogs or websites or zines, and the more up-close and frank, the better. It blows my mind, this virtual interactive forum, because for me it is a separate and 'secret' place that my friends don't know about and I plan to keep it that way, but at the same time with a publicly accessible forum like this one, especially one where feedback and comments are encouraged like they are here, the boundaries that govern who should read it and who shouldn't begin to blur.  I was nattering to David about this: the way that the online community is a silent, quasi-anonymous bunch of people who may as well be flatmates if you think about the level of disclosure they share, but often they've never even met, and what happens if they do? Do thin spidery cracks begin to splinter and mar the delicate walls of cyber space? Does the world implode? Does the sky fall? Is that a glitch in the Matrix? Does everyone begin to walk in circles scratching at their tongues and muttering "Cyril is an unfortunate name"?  I like to imagine what Gempires readers are like. Funnily, I have met some of you:  urlLink Vanessa  has long dark hair and a lovely round, perfectly formed face, and likes to wear coloured stockings;  urlLink Adam  I have met twice, briefly, both times at the Newcastle Writer's Festival, so I know what he looks like and I know he has a subtle accent of some whacky variety that I couldn't place; I began to read  urlLink Tim's  blog before I realized he was the same Tim that Vanessa had been writing about in her zines - her boyfriend no less, and I always pictured him (funnily enough, this image was very similar to the one I concocted whilst reading his blog without knowing who he was) as quite tall and thin, with a penchant for khaki army pants for some reason - hey Tim, am I close? And David I envisage having scruffy hair, wearing black t-shirts, and glasses, because I know for a fact that he wears glasses.  urlLink Raging Yoghurt  has a picture of herself on her site, and I picture her in that funny squinting shopping-for-rhubarb pose each time I read her blog. So you see, strangers, half-strangers, peripherals...it's rather like having a story come to life, and this is what I love about blogging. So. So. Surreal.  But the  best  thing about it - and I am in an exceedingly good mood today and may go on and on for ages so if you need to peel potatoes or wax your legs or have a baby you'd best get on with it - is that writers who I respect are reading this shite and liking it. I think. Here's some noteworthy praise for Gempires:  "Your blog is fabulous." -  urlLink Vanessa   "I like your blog." -  urlLink Adam  (Succinct. Nice.)  "That was really entertaining. And 'churning up a golly' is the best phrase I've heard in ages. I don't know exactly what it means but it makes me think of the time I almost choked on a boiled sweet." -  urlLink Tim   And the mother of all compliments: "As for Gempires - it will tickle your ego-bone to know that your site is one of the first things I do in the morning when I stagger out of bed, push Bronnie off my quilt, and headbutt the computer until it switches on, with a cup of coffee in my hands." -  urlLink David   That's fucking fantastic.  So, the above may look like a self-aggrandizing mini promo pack and you may be wondering when the  special offer   is gonna pop up, but really I think I suffer from the same case of pathological inner-critic that David's got (is that contagious? More to the point, is there a cure?) hence most of what I write doesn't get out of bed in the mornings. Or afternoons, evenings, weekends or public holidays. So that stuff makes me feel nice.  You know what? I think there is a cure, or at least a vitamin-esque make-betterer: blogging. Hello, Gempires, you make my day.  And some sex wouldn't go astray. Hello? I'm rubbing my own tits here.  Ignore that. I'm amorous.

       Dear Vanessa, (refer to Vanessa's comment under "Latent Genius" blog entry)   &nbsp;   So glad you finally showed up! I've been waiting for you...(said with menacing tone) The weird thing about you asking me whether you met me in Victoria Park is that I sent you an email a couple of days ago declaring that I did, and that I was thrilled to find your website (via your comment on Adam Ford's blog). Maybe you didn't get it yet.     My bed has finally been upgraded from a cumbersome ensemble to a lovely black base with a simple head and a low foot, as per my specifications when I bought it, because the horrid ensemble base I had would never fit up the stairs whenever I moved house. When I lived on King Street it spent three years against the wall in my lounge room, while my mattress upstairs sat on a makeshift base of glorified milk crates. When I went overseas it spent six months upright in a friend's loungeroom. When I moved to Marrickville it had to be hoisted over the upstairs balcony, and shunted back down again six months later. In Surry Hills, we realised that fucker wasn't squeezing upstairs within five minutes of trying, and after a couple of half-hearted twists and turns I declared that life was over for that useless slab of inconvenience and had it removed in a council pickup. Now I have a stylish fit-for-a-princess (with a very average income) bed with fabulous storage space underneath -  something of dire importance for a recovering hoarder like me.    &nbsp;   But I wish it could be as grand as you envisage.   &nbsp;   And hey, come back soon - and often - because your zines are the most inspirational in my collection; I fell in love with them, and writers like you are very, very important.

          Whaleboy, Thirsty, Ronnie and R2 Sweetu are going hard at yet another game of Office Balls because Boss Dre Bro has left the office, heading to King's Cross to sign a lease with his boyfriend. I have taken to shuffling about on the carpet with my rubber-soled shoes, distributing electric shocks because unlike the boys I don't have balls on the brain and rolling mouse balls along the carpet at a pin just doesn't interest me. I'd rather sit and type blog entries and construct private elaborate fantasies involving boys I have crushes on and naked romps. Oh, sex I shall soon be having, and oh it shall be grand.   Loud hollers from the boys who just finished a match. Shaking hands, they accidentally shock each other. The office is full of metal surfaces that click and spark mercilessly, making us all constantly wary of where we put our fingers. Turn on a tap: electric shock. Exit by turning the chrome door handle: electric shock. Hand a book to a workmate and brush hands: shock. Rub soles of feet vigorously on carpet and then touch Sweetu's ear: shock. But that's fun.   I'm cranky. Hungover. Drinks last night with Whaleboy and Thirsty. Trivia night. We came away with $25 worth of drink vouchers. Picture C was a camel, not a Llama. Drowsy from codeine for headache and Xanax to curb wheat reaction because I am a silly girl who is in denial about her wheat intolerance and ate banana bread for breakfast. Massive mood swing. Why do I do it? *Sigh* Every now and then I think,  maybe it's in my head , and then every time I eat wheat and remember what it feels like, I say,  never again . Until next time.   No more.

And if you tell anyone else at the office about this blog I will string you up by your testicles and coat you in syrup and baste you in hungry bull-ants and play a continuous recording of someone vomiting in your ear, very loudly. Oh, did I mention you would be naked throughout, and you would be in Pitt St Mall in the middle of winter? Then I will poo on your face.   		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink Yahoo!

      Yesterday's hangover rendered an early night last night a necessity. Strangely, staying in on a Friday or Saturday night excites me. It means I get to go to bed and read, or sit around and write, which for a person slowly rotting in the realm of nine-to-five, is a luxury. So I went to sleep at midnight, wake up at 8am, delighted to realise it is a sunny Sunday and my comfortable bed is mine for as long as I want it to be. If it was up to me I would drive to work in my bed, conduct my office duties from bed, eat in bed, write in bed (hang on, I do that), peel carrots in bed, wash my socks in bed, go to the pub, go to gigs, visit other countries in my bed. In my bed-wear, which in winter consists of a pale blue dress and some warm pants, and in summer consists of a pair of knickers. Bed is the epicentre of life and death: it's where most people are born, it's where many will die, and it's where most of us die a little death each night when the sandman sprinkles our ocular crinkles with golden granola, and then are reborn in the morning. It's where many of us are conceived. It's the platform where the dream train alights. It's just damn cool.  So I stay in bed till 11, relishing the warm comfie doonas and the freedom of Sunday stretching before me like a lovely bridge made of pink goose necks over a swamp of ikky muck. Ikky muck being the working week. My god I have issues.   At 11 my stereo kicks into 'wake up snoozing dudette' mode and Mr Bungle's  California  album infuses my listen-holes and I lay there unable to drag myself away from the melodies. What a fine fucking album. One of my all-time favourites. Eventually I crawl from my doona cave and shower and wash hair and return to my room to dress but not before wiggling and gyrating in front of my mirror for three or four songs in non-matching bra and knickers. My underwear rarely matches. I consider matching underwear to be self-conscious and contrived. Just like having dirty dishes is romantic. If the dishes are always done, you have your priorities wrong and you need to get laid more.  Cuzzy called me while I was checking my emails, and during our conversation my latent geniusness resurfaced. The conversation went like this:  "...so Cuzzy I'm glad we aren't really hanging out at the moment, because I think I've been a bit impatient with the whole friendship thing and putting too much pressure on it, and I think we just need to give it time to settle."  Cuzzy replied, with a relieved sigh, "Thankyou."  "I mean, this week you've probably been a bit confused and at a bit of a loss, even though you seem very in control and very...Brylcream."  "Did you just say  Brylcream ?"  I simultaneously burst out with, "Did you just hear what I said?  Brylcream !"  "Yeah I heard it. That was good!"  "Oh my god, that was THE BEST metaphor for ostensible coolness that anyone has ever come up with in the history of the world! It works on so many levels - I mean, what is Brylcream? It's a superficial slickness. And what does it hide? A catastrophic tangled mess!"  "Not only that," says Cuzzy, "but it  controls  things!"  "Yeah!!! And not only that - "  "And it's also not even cool!"  "That's what I was gonna say! People who use it only  think  they're being cool! Oh my god, I am a genius."  "Yeah. Put it in your blog."  "What do you mean 'put it in my blog'? Have you been reading my blog?"  "No."  I believe him. Am I naive? Not that I care.  This evening I saw Cuzzy at the pub and afterwards he drove me home. "So did you hear from the California Boy again?" he asked.  "Who, Marty? Yeah, but he's gone home. Why do you ask?"  "I don't know, cos we're friends. Friends gossip."  "Were you scared I would shag him?"  "No!" he answered quickly. "I just wanted to know if you had."  "Does that mean you want me to tell you when I sleep with someone else?" I only asked because I think it's a reasonable request. When Gravy and I broke up we agreed to tell each other when we slept with other people because I didn't want to hear it through the grapevine.  Cuzzy paused. "No, I was just wondering."  I'm glad he was cold to me last time he came over, a week ago. We were watching a DVD in my bed and I wanted to cuddle and he was pressed right up against the far wall as if I was a maggot-coated cockroach stinking of poo and vomit reading bad poetry with egg breath. It snapped me out of whatever doo-dah fantasy I was living in where I still wanted to hang out and fuck. Now I have no time for nonsense.  I don't like it when men grab their crotches in public. Behind closed doors is another matter: I like to watch. Rex and I were discussing the prudishness of Scorpio lovers today, each of us being well educated when it comes to shagging Scorpios. They have a reputation in the realm of astrology as being sexual deviants, and to a point this is true - they like sex and are curious about fucking lots of people, but get them into bed and it's clean, straight sex all the way. Gravy - a Scorpio - was  not  into anything even remotely kinky. He would never jerk off for me, and wouldn't let me do the equivalent in front of him. He was shy and tender and I kind of loved it, except when I felt naughty and devious, in which case I was a little frustrated. Prudes.

       Having consumed nought but a Narnar and an Arple for breakfast this morning (at my office desk, listening to the morning voice messages), I was hungry by the time 11am rolled around, and hence, being the practical girl that I am, I endeavoured to feed myself. For this morning's mastication I chose&nbsp;a container of Mudajjhara (I think that's how it's spelt, maybe it's Mujaddhara, or Mujjuddhharra): a lentil and rice dish from Yak Sleth Turko or whatever it's called, along with some tabbouli and hommous. While the gentleman was serving it up I watched one of the ladies baking the Pide rolls. It was much the same scenario as pizza making. She would place the knotted dough formations on a large paddle and shunt them onto the top shelf of the big oven, and with the same paddle she would take the ready ones from the lower shelf, five or six at a time, and toss them onto the bench, toasted golden. As I watched, one fell to the ground, and she nonchalantly acknowledged it and kept  shovelling the bread out of the cooker. I was given my food and my change, and I walked away.   &nbsp;   But I am&nbsp;a curious soul. Some would say a Nosey Parker (what  is  a Parker?). Others, Probing Bitch. So when I turned the corner I paused to see what would become of The Fallen Pide. The paddle-shoveller had a clandestine word to the other lady and the boy who had served me, who each glanced quickly at the people milling about in the food court, and then toward the ground.  Surely not , I thought.  Throw it away.  My position was side-on from the serving counter and they hadn't noticed me standing there staring at them. Serving Boy discreetly stooped and picked it up, quickly flicking it onto the display counter with the stack of Privileged Pides who had made it (which, piled behind the glass hot-bar, are reminiscent of an aquarium of procreating knuckles), still oblivious to my incredulous glare. They exchanged a surreptitious snicker. I stood waiting for one of them to turn and notice me, wanting very much to loudly say "I saw that" and be on my way,  just to let them know they weren't the smooth criminals they thought, but they remained oblivious, and I had only a short time left on my break, so I left feeling simultanously smug that I had witnessed such a misdemeanor and slightly reluctant that I didn't get to make my presence known. And glad I am wheat intolerant. At least I won't be eating the Fallen Pide. If I wanted to ingest such things I would lick the bottom of my shoe.   &nbsp;   Food is so much better when homemade. Last night's dinner was nutritious ambrosia and I was reminded how easy it is to made something very simple and tasty. I sauteed some tofu and broccoli in garlic, lemon juice and tabasco, added some basil and sunflower seeds, and sliced half an avocado on top. I am only slightly ashamed to announce that I have taken to eating my meals at home at my desk while using my computer. The horror and exhaustion of full-time work necessitates multi-tasking which is why I was also talking on the phone while waxing my legs.   &nbsp;   To Cuzzy, no less. I'm seeing him this Saturday night.   &nbsp;   Part of me is dying to see him: the optimistic part, while the sage in me is stubbornly reminding me that he will be Shelf Cuzzy, where he will sit himself on a platform that I am not quite allowed to reach, and stay there, just beyond the limits of my stretching fingers, unless he has 4+ beers, in which case he will drop his guard a little, and possibly try to kiss me. Actually, probably not. I think he knows that if he tried that at this point he would cop a sharp slap upside the head and a knee to the groin.&nbsp;How I despise Shelf Cuzzy. In the last few weeks I have been gradually losing faith that we can reinstate the wonderful friendship we once had. I think I might be naive in thinking that exes can be friends at all. It's all very disheartening when I think back on how it was between us pre-relationship, but now that all I get from him is moodiness and nonchalance and minus zero effort, I don't really see anything to mourn.   &nbsp;   Can you hear the dirge?   &nbsp;   On an ecstatic note,  urlLink David  and  urlLink Myrrh  have made my day. Declarations about their heartfelt approval of Gempires have stirred me from the dreamy "hey, people sometimes read this" state of mind, to, "holy shit, a couple of people talked to each other about it, and they weren't online at the time!" Having been writing for as long as I've been teeny, and having never submitted anything for publication, this is as momentous to me as the revelation moment in  The Truman Show  (what a great movie that was). It's like bursting through an apartment door and announcing "I'm here!" after having waited for years on the cold concrete landing below, waiting for someone to come home.   My latest comic character is Gaybits the Ejaculating Orphan. So far he is a bean-like formation with an eye and a fountaining pee-pee.     		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink Yahoo!

       Oh how I  loathe  whacksing day. Last night I set myself up in my bedroom floor on a beach towel with the heater on, internet radio playing, one tub of hot leg wax, and one tub of brazillian wax. I start at the bottom and work my way up. Even those tiny bits of fuzz on my big toes are not safe from my relentless follicle stripping.   &nbsp;   Waxing takes fucking hours, at least when I'm doing it myself, which I have to at the moment because I can't afford the luxury/humiliation of having it done for me. Humiliation in terms of the brazillian. With leg waxing it is quite unintrusive, just lying back babbling to the therapist as she deftly de-fuzzes my shins and calves, but the brazillian, oh god, I just feel awful having someone else do my tricky bits, even if they are getting paid the equivalent of $70 per hour. I deviated from my usual brand of wax last night, noting with interest the translucent turquoise colour rather than the usual caramel. When I pulled it from the microwave tray my first thought was,  hmmm, frog soup!    &nbsp;   Two and&nbsp;a half hours later I had twisted and contorted and ripped and stickied my way to lovely fuzz-free-ness once again. That smooth virginal plucked-chicken look does justify me standing naked in front of my mirror with one leg high up on the wall, curled forward like a preening feline licking its crotch, until my thighs and shoulders and neck hurt. Sometimes I procrastinate for too long, avoiding the inevitable whacksing day, with the result that I have to grit my teeth and set aside an entire evening to make up for it.    &nbsp;   When I had finally showered and slipped into bed, I ran my hands over the new smooth parts, which is phenomenally pleasurable, and I whispered to myself (as I am wont to do when I think there's nobody listening),  tee hee, I feel all Pleasant.  I giggled. It sounded surreal in the silent dark house. I sighed contentedly and closed my eyes, reflecting on how lucky I am to be free enough and privileged enough to enjoy the vanity of self maintenance. We are lucky, you know, with our western luxuries.   		 Do you Yahoo!?  Yahoo! Mail is new and improved -  urlLink Check it out!

      Would he curl around me in the night with firm relaxed forearm and make us be like sucking periwinkles...Would he open the curtains and inhale and turn to me and blow fresh moonlight all over my goosebumps...Would he steer my lips with his fingers and lick me warmly on the tongue and tremble when I graze his belly with fingernails...Would he start at the feet, tongue between my toes, and then pop them into his mouth like gumballs, suckle like an infant, crease his eyes in amusement when I squeal and writhe...  The toes are attached by thick syrupy wires to the clitoris. Gentlemen, suck her toes - she will pant and beg and heel.  Would he turn me to the mirror and stand behind me naked, peel a fat grape and gently use it to massage small spirals on my pink part, softly tweak a nipple and cradle a breast and press himself against my back and whisper,  look at yourself ...Would he ask me to keep my boots on...Would he lead me to the bathroom and prop me on the cold sink, cup my arse in big hands and knead and squeeze and forget where he is...Would my feet feel cold...Would he lift me off my feet and spread my thighs and graze with wet finger and kiss me hard when I gasp...  The bathroom is where all good people are conceived.  Would he ask me if I like it...Would I say oh honey I like it...Would he ask me what I wanted next...Would I whisper what do you want to give me...Would he say do you like me touching your pussy like this...Would I say oh please...Would he say please what and lather my breasts with his tongue and would I think of meat and gravy...Would I thrust at him and sigh loudly and not care about the noise and move on his fingers and grip his shoulders tightly...Would he lift me clear off the sink and slip deep inside me and would I feel orgasm from toes to tongue...Would he become breathless and would I and would we...  Oh.

      One of my all time favourite hysterical websites is  urlLink KissThisGuy.com.  Here you will find retarded misheard song lyrics: from Chisel's "Cheap Wine and a Female Goat" to Elvis's "Don't Be Cruel, to a Heartless Jew" and Robert Palmer's "Gonna Have to Face it You're a Dickhead in Love, Miner's Little Faces You're a Dick in a Glove..."  A friend of my mums thought that Greenday song that starts  Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road  was "Another turnip for the boy stuck in the rug."  I thought the Chilli Peppers song that goes  With the birds I share this lonely view, and...  was "Whip the virgin's head, it's a lonely amusement."  Anyone else?  Wonderful, pants-wetting hilarity.

       …continued from part 2   I love waking up on Saturdays. You do that thing where you momentarily panic because the clock says 10:13 and you think the alarm hasn’t gone off and you’re obscenely late for work, and then you realise it’s a stunning Saturday, and you writhe a bit in your lovely comfy bed, feeling the slinky material of your sleepy dress rubbing all over the fluffy doona, stretching your arms and legs pleasantly, rubbing your bare feet together at the heels and yawning through a contented smile, eyes still closed. In that moment the possibilities are endless and I am overwhelmed by the simple freedom stretching ahead of me. Should I read before I get up? Should I go to the gym before or after breakfast? Should I make a one-day zine and photocopy it in time to hand out tonight?   At this point, I go back to sleep.  But surprisingly I do eventually get up at the semi-decent hour of eleven, help myself to a bowl of leftovers from our dinner party and eat it in the sunny yard with Amee and Joe. They head off on some kind of romantic bike ride and I hang out my wet laundry and wish I owned better underwear because it is so vulnerable and raw hanging there on the line for everyone to see. I briefly consider buying some more and then decide, as usual, that my money could be better spent this weekend on something I really need, like soup bowls or leg wax or nice matching sheets.  I ignore my subconscious scoffing.  You mean, like beer?   I make it to the gym. The bad thing about gyms is that for some reason someone will always fart, and it will stink. I have no explanation for this phenomenon. In a city like Sydney you are constantly frottaging with a multitude of skanky strangers on buses, in theatres, on streets. Occasionally the odd fart might squeak its way into the general mass, but not as a rule. Why is it that people on exercise machines feel compelled to fart? It’s very disconcerting to be air-wading ridiculously on a cross-trainer while being assaulted by the suffocating stink of someone’s exploding sphincter. For one thing, looking around suspiciously at others nearby with a suitable look of subtle revulsion in order to make it clear that it wasn’t you is distracting to one’s fitness regime. For another, if you’ve sweated and bounced halfway through a forty minute workout you’re not about to desert the whole mission on account of someone’s inconsiderate anus, so you’re stuck there until it wafts away.   You just don’t do that.  When the shadows have reached balcony height on the huge four storey terraces across the road I head down the street to Angel’s house. Kim, Emma and Amity are there, and we sit on the floor in Angel’s dim kitchen sipping warm spicy chai and soy milk. Someone notices how small Emma’s feet are. Looking down at them, I am amused by how much they seem like Ernie’s feet – from Sesame Street. “Does that mean you have a little dick?” I asked.  “Everyone says that – yes it’s true. I have a tiny penis.” Emma knocks her tiny round shoes together at the toes.   “Isn’t it the size of the nose?”  “I thought it was the hands.”  “Um, it’s more about the size of the crotch,” I offer.   “Yeah, the size of the cock all depends on the size of the cock.”  We laugh, and then I laugh at the fact that we laughed at all.  Eventually Amee and Joe arrive and we head to the Union where Sylves is having farewell drinks.  The Union is a depressing hole of a place with big cafeteria style benches, tall stools, and horrid sport-blaring TVs. Is this a rule in pubs now? That they must have TVs showing sports? It’s ubiquitous. It detracts from: a)	the level of conversation b)	the quality of conversation c)	my desire to stay and keep drinking.  Men, and Jonnie, begin to yell at the screens, their impassioned bellows rocking my middle ear and shifting it a little so that it becomes my skewiff off-centre ear; Jonnie goes off on some tangent about the team or the game or whatever to whoever will listen and I try not to snarl too much about the way they turn up the volume because one day the wind will change and my face will look like an arse.  The beers keep coming.   Nina is up from Melbourne and it’s about fucking time. Oh Neener, with your fresh face and your beautiful smile and sparky eyes, why did you leave us? We need more people like you. People who write and create and strive for something more than making money to go out and spend money on booze and drugs and rent. People who have more than a tongue-scabbed grasp on vocabulary. People who don’t get defensive and call you a haughty bitch when you use words like ‘ubiquitous’ and ‘eloquent’ and ‘scatological’ or think that you are secretly calling them ignorant. She brings me back to the level of ‘fuck it and do it’ when I talk about moving to Melbourne, which I absolutely must do someday in spite of the gloomy prospect of bone-brittling jaw-chattering winters.  I spent two weeks in Melbourne’s winter once. I had to wear everything I had the entire time, all at once. At that time my preferred ensemble was coloured slip-nighties, fluffy flares, some fluoro psychedelic top, and a big blue fluffy coat with a faux fur collar. I wore thermals underneath and all four of my slips at once, layered over each other in descending order of length: a short yellow one, then blood-red, then green, then blue. Stylin. I remember waiting for a tram at 6am on Sunday, trying to get back to St Kilda from the city, literally freezing my tits off. I watched them solidify, drop from my chest onto the bitumen, and shatter into trillions of teeny was-breasts, while I helplessly rubbed my hands together and tucked them into my sleeves and stomped in my purple beetle sneakers and lamented the loss of my snap-frozen breasticles.  It’s ok, they grew back. Amazing regenerative powers, boobs – like lizard’s tails.  So we become part of the furniture at the Union for a while and I tell Nina about my epiphany and she shows me the soft puffy skull badges she has been selling in Melbourne shops and talks about how you can actually make a living being creative down there and I chatter to Sylves about Gravy and how he still won’t reply to my emails and she says yeah that’s because he still hasn’t accepted that you’ve broken up and I say the whole thing is really pathetic and it makes me sad and angry and she asked how things were with Cuzzybro and I answer that I haven’t really seen him and I’m giving it time to chill but at the same time I’m thoroughly unimpressed with his stupid aloofness and Nathan sits and stares and Amee makes a star shape out of some matches and I notice she’s uncharacteristically introspective and then her and Joe have an in-depth couple discussion and I remark to someone that I’m really happy to be single at the moment and we eat a packet of chips. Grunge on the jukebox. We reminisce about Pearl Jam. Suwindi speaks softly about her and Al and the impending end of their relationship and I think about how earthy she is. I ask where Good Buddha are and she answers  Brisbane  and I briefly wonder if Cuzzy is smoking cigarettes again, and then someone decides we’re going to the Lansdowne.  We trickle there in taxis. There’s a hip-hop battle going on. Rene and Dollface are already there. Our crew quickly establishes its nesting ground for the evening. I realize I’m drunker than I realized. The pub is choked with smoke and the amateur MCs in the background are way more intrusive than entertaining. Nath intermittently yells at them to shut up, as if they had all bundled into his bedroom and set up next to his bed uninvited. I am surprised and delighted to see Joelistics (Joelicksdicks) – also up from Melbourne, and we chat about Cuzzy and  urlLink TZU  and something and nothing and the other thing, and as usual I walk away affected by him, as everybody does, because the man is magic, and has a way of slipping beneath your eyelids while you’re not looking and stepping into your skin and looking outwards through your eyes and then slipping out again, leaving little Licksdicks specks behind in your eye vessels.  I ask Manny how many grams there are in an ounce. “Don’t you know?” he splurts.  I take a punt. “Um, four?” He laughs.  “Fifty?” He laughs louder, and nearly falls to the ground.  “Its twenty-eight, mate.” We are both cackling like fools. He strokes my back for a moment and I briefly wonder what it would feel like to fuck him. “You’re a Virgo, you should know things like this.” We share a much-celebrated Virgo solidarity thing.   “Well now that you’ve told me, you know I’ll never forget it!”   “Yeah, you’re right. A Virgo never forgets.”   Am I drunker than I think?  I don’t remember.  It’s Sunday afternoon: late, when Amee comes into my room to see if I’m ok.  “Gemma, are you alive?”  “I’m very extremely hungover.”  “Oh my god! Have you gotten out of bed yet?”  “Once. To brush my teeth.” I roll over and open an eye, recoiling at Amee’s fresh face and gleaming smile. She had fucked off from the pub much earlier than me.  “It’s four o’clock!” she laughs.  “I know. I’ve been eating codeine all day to get rid of a headache. Headache stay. Codeine make me go sleep.”  She starts uncoiling the extension cord that attaches the modem to my computer.  “I just ate some fish.”  “Really?” I open the other eye, interested. We’ve both been vegetarian for years. “What did it taste like?”  “Nothing, really. Well, it tasted like…something that is really really good for you.”  “Ha. Was it fishy?”  “Not really, well, not like overly, I mean, I could tell that it was obviously…something that had once been an animal…” Amee does this thing when she’s explaining things where she gazes into the distance for optimum concentration and chooses each word very carefully, illustrating her description in the air with elaborate hand movements. I suddenly open my mouth and let forth a tremendous bellow of laughter. It had occurred to me that we were discussing the eating of fish like it was a new discovery for humankind, not something that people do every day. “But I’m confused about my ethics now. Vegaquarian. I don’t think I like the sound of Vegaquarian.”  “Well you’ve done it now” I answer, dragging a limp wrist through my messy hair and reaching for some water. My mouth is tumbleweed dust. My head is a dented tin of beans. “You’re not a veggo anymore. You know, sometimes I scare myself with the idea that I’m just going to eat calamari all of a sudden.”  “Yeah fully.” She disconnects the modem and exits with it. I head to the bathroom and undress, casting an interested glance at myself in the mirror before stepping into a hot shower, swaying unsteadily.  Food. I. Need. Food.  It takes me a couple of hours but eventually I make it to the Maya South Indian restaurant for a Masala Dosa. By now I am nauseous and the appearance of my meal coincides with me breaking out in a cold sweat. Something tells me I am going to be sick, within seconds.  I race to the bathroom. One toilet. Its insides are soon decorated with a frogspawn spattering of little black seeds: remnants of the kiwifruit I had eaten earlier. I am quite pleased by this urgent expulsion of tummy pulp. I feel unburdened.  Two DVDs later I am back in bed reading David’s manuscript, sipping antacid.   I resolve to abstain from alkyhole for a bit.

       I hate it when people call me Emma. Or Janice or Jenny or Jennifer or Jenna or any of the other variations I cop. I hate marching during peak hour with the Corporate Sydney Soldiers, all getting in my way with their swinging arms and erratic direction changes and the incessant hurryhurryhurry and that every-person-for-themselves-and-pretend-everyone-else-is-invisible attitude. I am not made to work full-time. I am not made to work in an office. I am not suited to tedium or conservatism or air-conditioning. My nose is stuffy and I would like to announce that I am Gem and I'm in a bad mood.   		 Do you Yahoo!?  Read only the mail you want -  urlLink Yahoo! Mail SpamGuard .

      Like werdfukkery? Need  urlLink Antipoet. Allan Boyd  is from Perth and is one of my most loved and oft peroused blatherticians. Not only does he cook up baroque, flavoursome tidbits for us all to digest, he really knows how to deliver a captivating oral performance too. That sentence could conceivably be misconstrued as rude, if I was inclined to think it was, but I don't, and neither should you. The man loves his words and knows just how to tickle them. Visit his poetry site, if you please, or, as two animated Siamese cats once sang on a cartoon I barely remember: if you don't please.

       ...continued from blog below   So Amee and I are strewn on the couch wrapped in coats like chrysalis grubs, moaning about how full our stomachs are and taking deep breaths to appease our swollen abdomens. Our limbs are floppy and our tongues thick in the aftermath of the joint-tokes and everything we say comes out sideways and fruity. Somehow we start talking about birds rooting.  "Yeah, do birds have dicks?" I ask. We giggle. "Are they retractable, like dog's pink lipsticks? Or do they have a little nob hanging down?" We giggle again. Amee has a delightful chortle when she's stoned or drunk that kind of glugs around in her throat and sounds bouncy and cylindrical: fat sponges of laughter pop from her larynx and out through her mouth.  "I don't know! Maybe they have cloakas like girl birds and maybe they just mash their gashes together." (Another one for you,  urlLink Adam F ?) We roar. "Joe," Amee hollers, "Joe! Where are cocks' cocks?"  Joe walks from the study and squints at us with his bleary ganjicated eye slits, and says, "What's that, Babe?", in his moppy pommie accent.  "Do cocks have cocks, I mean like roosters? Gem and I are trying to figure out how birds fuck."  "Yeah right. Er, dunno mate. Sorry." He heads back to the study to listen to more MP3s with dollface, shaking his head. Between Amee and I, the merry giggling makes the room warm and full, our laughter boings and smacks the walls and seeps into the crevices, filling all the cracks. The hysteria rises. Soon we are wailing like fresh widows.  "Imagine if they had little human-like dicks," Amee squeals, "with little balls and everything."  I am crying now and my ribs are throbbing and I am gasping and spluttering. We nearly asphyxiate on guffaws, imagining ducks with human cocks, and when I mention "pubic feathers" Amee's mouthful of red wine goes fountaining all over the floor, a cheery red rain, and runs down her chin, reminiscent of some deranged vampiress mid-feed. Through all the wailing and hooting we realize that we had each instantly envisaged our own version of the feathered friends in question: "Oh my god!" I took another deep breath. "Your duck was standing on the shore with a raging hard-on, and mine was paddling serenely through the pond with its flaccid genitals trailing behind it." I ran upstairs to write it down and almost lost myself in a puddle of mirth on the way. I sat on my bed trying to collect myself, my little book in my hands, chortling madly, and each time I unbelted another chapter of cackles, Amee would hear from downstairs and answer with an instalment of her own, which would set me off again, and so-on, until my room and the loungeroom were dripping with saliva and humid with carbon dioxide and nearly uninhabitable.  We settled back into  urlLink Meet The Feebles . I am soon amused / disturbed by the fact that Arthur the Worm looks uncannily like  urlLink William H Macy  - that actor who always plays loser guys, and is in  Fargo  and  Boogie Nights  and I think  Happiness . I couldn't find a picture of Arthur the Worm to link to but if anyone knows where one is please let me know, especially if he's looking particularly  That Guy From Fargo -ish. I would love to stick them both here for comparison. Anyway at the point where I notice the resemblance, I point at the screen and bleat "Holy Fuck! It's that loser guy from Fargo!"  Amee studies him for a second. "Oh my god, it fully is!"  "How can a puppet grub be a person? That's really unfortunate!" Bleat, snort. I race upstairs again to write it down and nearly tear a hole in my oesophagus in the process, hysteria erupting from me like Someone's Sunday Breakfast on the Rebound, but nicer.  By the time I re-emerge Amee is asleep on the couch.  I wobble upstairs and crash about my room trying to turn on my computer so that I can blog. I lunge sideways and land on my bed, giggling, and realize I'm too messy to type. My laptop lurches into life and I immediately silence it again, click the lid shut, and climb into bed, grateful that it's still relatively early and the weekend has hardly begun.   To be continued again...

       Friday's dinner party was a lovely civilised affair. Fewer people than expected turned up because of The Imbroglio of Exual Politics: if A is invited, her ex B must be excluded, and we did invite Blah, so Whatsie can't come because he is fucking Blah's ex. As it turns out, Blah was told that Whatsie was coming by a misinformed third party, therefore he declined to show, along with his sidekick Thingo, because Thingo and Blah were drinking in Newtown together instead of coming over. But that's ok. We were a bit concerned about our lack of resources anyhow. Divided amongst the expected twenty people, we would each be allocated either one dinner plate or one bread and butter plate or a tiny bowl; either a spoon or a fork but never both; three quarters of a chair; one tenth of a wine glass or a full mug, and a little less love to go round. But there were about fifteen of us in the end, fitting comfortably in the loungeroom on our kitchen chairs and our couches and the stairs and  Amee's tiny fragile bamboo chair, which strangely was the most sat-on piece of furniture for the evening, despite it being about twenty centimeters high, and so narrow between the arms that it sticks to your arse when you try to stand up.   &nbsp;   "Loaf, you're an entity!" I exclaimed when he walked into our loungeroom where a circle of chairs of varied sizes and degrees of comfort had been arranged. "Out of all the chairs here you head straight for the one least likely to do the job of a chair. Not only that, but you've moved it to right in front of the stairs. Good on you, you wonderful spaz." Loaf is probably the tallest of us all, apart from Joe. Enigma, that man.    &nbsp;   Jonnie arrives in one of his moods. You can tell straight away when Jonnie has the shits.&nbsp;A cold slice of black knifes its way into the room and into your skull like painful tooth-freeze when he enters. You can see the steam rising from his head like a fresh hot turd. He's an erratic scorpio - nothing sums up a scorpio like that old nursery rhyme about the little girl with the little curl in the middle of her forehead:   &nbsp;    When they are good, they're very, very good,     But when they are bad, they're fucking horrid!    &nbsp;   I cautiously slink toward Jonnie as he leans against our kitchen bench complaining about having to drive and not being able to drink, suspecting with every pore in my epidermis that he has had some kind of fight with Xanthe, and go to offer him a hug. "What's wrong, Jon?" I laugh and put my arms around him. He grabs me by the wrists and holds my arms away from him so that I am unceremoniously halted mid-embrace.   &nbsp;   "Nothing, fuck off you skank hoe." This is Jonniespeak for  sorry, I'm in a bad mood.    &nbsp;   "What? I just want to give you a hug!"   &nbsp;   " I don't want to hug you."   &nbsp;   I refrain from being offended, knowing that next time I see him he will give me an apologetic grin and watch my reaction to see if he's forgiven and I will smile back and call him a moody cunt and tell him  lucky I love you cos you're such a cunt sometimes  and he will giggle and hug me and say  I love you Gem, I really do .   &nbsp;   But for tonight he's in the bad books. He fucks off to the pub for a beer with Xan and Joe and comes back a little more on form. I like how he's like that, the midget spazflinger. Keeps me on my toes. Once you've got him figured out, you just have to adapt to his moods, and then he's an angel, for the most part. That's him in the picture with me at the top of Gempires.   &nbsp;   When dinner's ready I sashay into the loungeroom and announce in a loud sing-song, "Comestibles! Mucheros! Foody Food!" Suchy giggles and says it was the best invitation for food he'd ever heard. By this stage Joe's magical ginger-kiwi-champagne-choc-drop punch has been mostly finished and I am well into my wine, and not really very hungry since we had put out dips and munchies while waiting for everyone and had done a little too much grazing. We grab plates and load them with feasties from the kitchen and take it all into the loungeroom where we gulp and yock and garrie and harble our way through moroccan casserole and herbed rice and salad and lentil dip and hommous and vegan-brown-rice-rhubarb-apple-tofu-strawberry-chocolate-faux-cheesecake (on yer rex) and then we whinnied and twittered and "oh my god look at Angel's tullamarine vulva" 'd and cheersed and clinked glasses and horropped and "can someone shut the fucking front door it's like a weeping wound vortex' 'd, and Xan  asked how my wall was coming, the one with the big penis picture, and I said it's still a work in progress with just the one penis up there so far and did you mean to say coming? And we prattled about wide-ons and Kim said "do you know what a pink sock is? It's gonna be my DJ name. It's when you have anal sex and there's not enough lube and too much friction and you pull the cock out and the anal wall comes sliding out wrapped around the cock" and we all mock-puke and Rex and Emma keep asking about the time because they have to leave to go to work at the club and nobody has a watch so they just forget about it until they remember again and Joe starts passing one of his infernal Cognac Trumpets and the room smells like ganja...   &nbsp;   Then everyone left - suddenly, it seemed, and it was just me and Amee and Joe and Dollface. The boys went into the study to listen to MP3's while Amee and I put "Meet the Feebles" on because one drag of Joe's Cognac Trumpets makes us stoned, us non-smokers-until-it's-shoved-in-our-faces-when-we're-drunk...   &nbsp;    To be continued ...

      &nbsp;  Yay! 9:20 am is a very decent hour to rise! Indeed it is! I agree! I too, as well, also! Didn’t make it to the Friend in Hand last night, or to work at my second job for that matter, having other important things to take care of such as my zine, which I am proud to say is on the home stretch and just needs to be printed out, assembled and photocopied. But  sheeeeit , I fucking hate the photocopying bit. You would think it would be a simple operation but between the double-sided photocopying, running out of credit halfway through and having the machine re-set itself without me realizing, and getting confused about what goes where, I always manage to stuff up a few times and waste a bit of paper. It takes so goddamn long but it’s worth it at the end when you’re standing in Kinko’s looking at a warm pile of newly folded and stapled zines and smelling that pungent toner.  &nbsp;  My laptop opened before Midday yesterday and closed after Midnight last night. Oh, she’s a little trooper, is Raunch Toy. Radio shits me. I have had it on for the past few days because our broadband connection has slowed to 28 K because we have used our 1GB limit (we immediately signed up for the 12GB deal which starts in eleven days bloody hurrah yay woo hoo) and I have been using what is left on my dial-up account, which is no good for streaming internet radio, so I have said a temporary goodbye to my lovely jazz writing music, and because I can’t write to music that I know the words to I can’t play any of my CDs. Hence, the radio. I have a number of stations programmed into my stereo and I spend all day bearing one station until the inane talking becomes too much or one of the commercial stations plays an ad, and then it’s on to the next one. I LOATHE commercial radio, because of the commercials. The minute I hear one, off it goes. Sometimes I’m momentarily too engrossed in my writing to notice the ads, but something in the backyard dunny of my semiconsciousness subtly alerts me that something is grating, and I realize it’s a stupid ad, and I immediately reach for my remote and switch channels, feeling momentarily annoyed. All this has led me to conclude that I should invest in some cheap jazz compilation CDs or some Best of Thelonious Monk or some instrumental Hip-Hop (ahem, Cuz? Been hassling you for a year now) or some instrumental anything but not Enya…even some peace-out pan flute music would be nice. I see a new genre opening up in my collection. I shall call it “Music to Fuck Words By”.  &nbsp;  Yum. I have my homemade wheat-free cereal (by homemade I mean self-assembled) made from a salmagundi of puffed millet, puffed rice, puffed corn, soy grits, dried fruit, coconut, sunflower seeds and pepitas, with sliced banana (hehe, I just typed ‘bababa’ and it made me laugh), sesame seeds and soy milk.&nbsp; It has been beautifully warm and sunny all week, just for me and my holiday (thanks world, ‘preciate it), and the best thing is, I STILL HAVE MONDAY! Ah, delicious homemade long-weekend (by homemade I mean self-assembled).  &nbsp;  Rene brought home the most hilarious assortment of knitting pattern magazines last night, all dating from the very early eighties, containing a host of utterly tragic models in overstated, contrived poses (I especially like the “Sprained Neck” pose of one hairspray-addled woman: she is basically clutching at her neck, leaning to one side, and pouting self-consciously at the camera) wearing the most nauseating repugnant and therefore very cool knitted ensembles, including swimwear, and midriff boy’s vests in brown and yellow. I sat at the kitchen table and flicked through every one, laughing uproariously at each picture. Rene came in from the loungeroom with her dinner and sat across the kitchen from me, laughing. “You’re my entertainment,” she said. I showed her the man in the white cable-knit jumper, holding a ridiculous bunch of silver heart-shaped balloons, mid-guffaw at something in the distance. She nearly spat out her food. I may have to include some of them in my zine.  &nbsp;  My printer/scanner/copier is tres cool.  &nbsp;  Oh, and for Vanessa and anyone else who pictured a cross-trainer to look like some kind of metal trap, a cross-trainer is one of those exercise machines where you step up and down with your feet, and slightly round and round, so that it’s like a cross between stepping up and down and peddling a bike, while your hands each hold a handle that moves back and forth, so while your legs are doing something like an underwater jog, your arms move out and in like slow punching moves. Does that make sense? It’s quite good because it doesn’t jar your knees and ankles like jogging but it gets you sweating.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Holy Expletive, there’s a lot of shite on community radio. I’ve been listening to the same bagpipe-with-monotonous-beat track on 2SER FM for the past ten minutes and it’s showing no sign of progressing or dying. No joke, it’s an understated drum beat, like a funeral march, layered over an erratic wailing bagpipe, and the whole thing sounds like a couple of children composing a mourning song for their dead scotch terrier, McScruff.  Amongst the boring things I bought from Coles this evening was a light globe, some kidney beans, and four batteries. The batteries are to replace the dead ones that have been rotting uselessly in my discman for months, much to my annoyance, because every time I have wanted to use it I would remember that the batteries were flat: a thought that never occurred to me when I was in a position to buy batteries. I fucking hate buying things that I need. I like to spend my money on exciting things, and the process of actually going to the shop to purchase toilet paper or tampons or steel wool is a disappointing dénouement. I usually buy myself some chocolate to make myself feel better. I actually really enjoy supermarkets, especially good ones like Coles that have a big health section and Indian and Asian and Mexican sections, as well as stationery (I could look at staplers and glue sticks all day) and rows and rows of vitamins proudly on display like stocky little soldiers, but when it comes to grabbing necessities and putting them in my basket I have to talk myself out of dropping the idea (and the basket) and running off to do exciting things. Every now and then I give in, and just run. Evidently I’m not made to be a housewife, and I am destined to be rich and spoiled and have someone to do my boring things for me.  But I am at the point where I desperately need to have a working discman, hence the batteries. This week I have been using the gym during the day when the televisions are tuned to horrible daytime programs and rude belching ads. Some hip-hop on the discman will be a welcome anodyne. Reading has been nice because I have found that my current book sits open quite well while I’m sweating and bouncing as long as I bend it backwards with each page turn, but this is annoying, and most other books are too fat or too uncooperative to stay open if I’m not holding them, which is most inconvenient if I happen to be using my arms on a cross trainer. So I shall distract myself with music instead.  Oh, Sydney. This beautiful warm climate sent me on a sojourn to the Botanical Gardens this afternoon to sprawl on the grass in the sunshine and read. I bought a Picnic bar on the way to complete my pleasure leisure – I wasn’t being ironic, I had passed a billboard near Oxford Street advertising them: the one with a massive picture of the chocolate against a white background with the words “Deliciously Ugly” underneath. Chocolate advertising is evil. I am incredibly susceptible to it. Once chocolate is on my mind it simply doesn’t leave. In winter, against my will, I eat the stuff every fucking day, because it is heavenly ambrosia, and gives me a feeling of comfort and bliss that is hard to compare – apparently this effect is much more pronounced in women than in men, according to a book about chocolate Rene gave me years ago, knowing how addicted I am. It’s my one weakness.  I can stop anytime I want. Really.  On my way to the gardens I passed two of Sydney’s token homeless characters. Poo Hands is an awful, putrid man with a tattooed face and a huge gut and drooping tracksuit pants and Hepatitis, or so he claims. My sympathy for his plight (mentally ill and poor) is somewhat superseded by revulsion because of the menace he creates. His ‘thing’ is to ask people for money, and if they decline he will shout “I’m gonna poo! I’m gonna poo and I’ve got hepatitis!” He will then take a shit on the footpath and threaten to put it on people or make them step in it if they don’t give him something. He walks around all day shaking people’s hands after wiping his arse with them. When I saw him today I couldn’t help my nose from scrunching, and it made me feel kind of bad.  Then there is Recorder Man. There is a soft spot in my heart for Recorder Man. He sits on a milk crate on the corner of two busy Sydney Roads near the Australian Museum with his knees splayed wide, hunched forward so his massive belly bulges between his legs, both elbows on his knees because his work is clearly exhausting, and huffs tunelessly on a recorder waiting for people to throw him some change. He always looks so worn out, pausing frequently between blows with a look of defeat on his face as if under immense pressure, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand, then resuming his tooting as if to say “must…keep…going…” When I passed him he was returning from a hard day at work, carrying his crate in one hand and his recorder in the other looking for all the world like he was on the home stretch of a twelve month walking journey in which he was condemned to continuously carry his accoutrements, or die.  The gardens were full of noisy squawking Ibises and ducks and bats. Ibises look out of place high up in the trees – they look much too big to have flown up there, and seem awkward, like tiny old men dropped from a spaceship onto the branches, who have just woken up and wonder where in the world they are. I always have an urge to pick them up by their long curved beaks and swing them like umbrellas, like Alice does with the flamingos in Wonderland. One of those sweet black water birds with the pointy red beaks sidled up beside me, squirted a crap and then coughed up some vomit. I was fascinated and enchanted. I love a good duck.  So I sat and read until they turned down the sun. I have been on the same book for an age –  urlLink Requiem For A Dream  - and have finally had some time to pick it up again and am now near the end, and holy shit, it’s even more intense than the movie. In true Hubert Selby Jr style, it is forehead-creasingly confronting and altogether disturbing. I was only glad I could maintain my marvellous mood when I closed it, because the poor gentle Jewish-American lady character Sara Goldfarb, who innocently becomes hooked on diet pills and sinks into insanity, made me think about my Nan, and how she’s starting to forget things, and how she’s so small compared to how she was when I was little, and how she doesn’t have my Pop anymore and she’s withdrawn and defeated, and how I never see her because she lives on the Central Coast, and how when Pop was sick she suddenly became lucid and wise, and now that he’s gone she’s more confused than ever, and…  I have to stop now. My heart hurts and my eyes sting.  You know how you sometimes have those ridiculously cool days where shit just happens the way it’s supposed to? Maybe it’s just me and my easily excited ways, but the little things that all went my way today just manifested in this delicious appreciation for the world and my city and my life. When I arrived at the gardens and took up my usual position on the grass near the harbour I surveyed the delicious golden sunlight; the flapping birds and gallumphing dogs; the sailboats on the twinkling water and the swaying palm trees; the joggers and walkers and sitters; and it struck me that Sydney is an incomparable and striking city with these awesome oases smack in its centre. At times the crowds are too much, but really, this city fucking rules. Structurally and climatically speaking.   So then I walked to Circular Quay and bought myself a delicious and surprisingly cheap soy hot chocolate which I sipped next to the harbour, made a trip to the bathroom which had been closed for cleaning but re-opened when I arrived right on cue – in streamed a large queue of waiting women and me, into a sparklingly clean bathroom, and I felt as if I’d been personally invited; walked to the bus stop and immediately boarded a bus bound for  my street , grinning out the window because the world knows I am on holiday and is striving to make things ultra nice.   Dinner : Mexi-beans, guacamole and lettuce.  Listening : 2SER still, which has moved on from the bagpipes and is now featuring an annoying, pointless, epic, ambient piece which is rather like a piece of paper being held to a fan alongside a pulsing hunk of medical equipment and some fingernails being scratched on a blackboard.   Wearing : The At Home Outfit – yes, the blue dress and slippers.  Excited about : Drinks with Shingo on Friday arvo;  urlLink Justin Heazlewood  at the Friend In Hand tomorrow.  Repulsed By : Poo Hands.

      This morning when I stretched and de-bedded and slurped some water and headed to the bathroom I was overcome by an inexplicable craving for french toast with maple syrup. When I was younger I was crazy about that shit, and would keenly whip up a giant bowl of eggs and milk, slop some sliced white bread in it, fry it up in great slatherings of margerine while it puffed up and turned golden, and then baste it with enough maple syrup to lubricate an orgy. I would do it every Saturday and Sunday morning while the parents read the paper in bed and the siblings bounced around looking for mischief before settling in with the comic section. Then the five of us would congregate on mum and dad's big bed, curled around their legs, scooping up comfortable lumps of doona to lean our elbows on as we read Ginger Meggs and Hagar the Horrible and Garfield. Ah yes, Camp Happy Family. My how things change.  But this is an urge I cannot satisfy. In a wheat-free egg-free diet there really is no room for french toast and maple syrup. To console myself I may pour myself a large plate of syrup, but it won't be the same. Perhaps I should whip up a concoction of sourdough rye dipped in wheggs (vegan egg alternative) and soy milk?   Last night at Bardfly  urlLink Justin "The Bedroom Philosopher" Heazlewood  performed his special brand of acoustic hilarity, which is largely why I wanted to go so much, aside from wanting to get Amee out of the house and away from her troubled relationship for a night. I bought Justin's CD "Living on the Edge...of my Bed" about a year ago and loved it instantly. He does this new piece that I have heard twice now and it perforates my bladder each time, it's probably called "I'm So Postmodern", and from memory a couple of the lines are:   I'm so postmodern I got a tattoo of my pin number done in hieroglyphics on my neighbour's guide dog, I'm so postmodern I got some alphabet soup, dyed it purple, and threw it on the lawn, I'm so postmodern I invite strangers to my house, and show them slide shows of other people's nans...   Paraphrased. Of course it's ten times better when he sings it. He's living in Melbourne now, so y'all Victorians, look out for him, he will make your jaw hurt and split little cracks into the sides of your mouth. Oh, and he'll be back at the  urlLink Friend In Hand  this Thursday for the "Mic In Hand" comedy nite. I'm goin fo' sheedo (that's hip-hop for "for sure" yo).  I fukn love people who do good shit. I will support it fervently with all the gristle in my spleen in the hope that this world eventually morphs into a planet of happy quirky arty types.  It's another one of those vitamin-C enriched sunny days. My little window frames an oasis of lush green trees: a rarity in Sydney. My room thankfully faces the back of the house where a weird little lane divides our yard from the yards of houses behind, in which some lovely healthy foliage grows - a tall fern and a palm and something pale green and fluffy, and something tall with deep green waxy leaves, and a very overgrown weed which nevertheless looks nice and green smacked against the blue sky. When I say "weird little lane" I mean WEIRD, LITTLE lane. It's one of those metre-wide bits in between houses, closed off at either end by a wall, where there is nothing but weeds and a big discarded pot-plant and breeding mosquitos. Apparently back in old Sydney Town, these little lanes were the exits for the horses which of course lived in stables in the backyard, as you do.  You are. Your mum's one.  Sorry, lapse of concentration.  I'm digesting breakfast so that I can go to the gym and grind my legs and arms on a cross trainer. I am enjoying the feeling of my thighs right now because all the exercise has made them tight and sinewy and strong, and I have a good mind to wrap them around someone's neck.

      I am free. I have never been so relieved and thrilled to be on holiday. Morning arrives and I wake and think  heh, what yoo gon' do, world? Demand something from moi? Heh. Not this week you ain't.  I stretch and roll about and make star-jump bed-angels (ie I splay like a starfish) and grin, imagining all the things I will do with my day, constructing a schedule for myself revolving around gym, writing and reading ( oh   what  bliss ), ensuring there are large gaps of nothing to accommodate spontaneous inspirations. Monday shoots past, engulfed by an indulgent sleep-in, some reading, a visit to the gym, and an evening glass of wine with the flatmates and Jake.   This week I intend to edit Gempires into a zine and distribute it amongst friends. The thought of doing this gives me pleasure akin to a gentle toe-suck. It's been so long since I had the time to make a zine. The unfortunate tendency is for me to start one in a free moment and fail to finish it as a result of leaving it for too long and losing interest, and I am always reluctant to recycle old stuff, because I am a snake and I shed my skins. Gempires will have to be edited quite heavily before I would print it out for general perusal but I relish the notion.  Hello, life. It's good to see you again.  It was a stunning day in Surry Hills today. One of those bubble bath days where you just want to slip into the sky. It was so gorgeous and blue I had an idea to poke my finger up into it and scrape off a nice tasty wad like a scoop of fingerbun icing and stick it on my tongue. Sweet stuff, blue skies. I had a compulsion, as I usually do on beautiful days, to read a book on some grass (I mean sit on some grass and read a book, not research marijuana), and thought I might walk to the Botanical Gardens, which is one of my all-time favourite reading spots because it combines a whole spattering of my favourite things: sea view, ducks in ponds, open expanses of lush grass in sun or shade, and squeaking bats dripping like furry fruits from tree branches, corpse-like with their folded arms holding their wings around their little bodies.  Oh my god, I sound like a little old lady.  But I went to the gym, had some food, chatted to Joe about boygirl politics and gave him advise about his floundering relationship, and got writing. Here I am still. The sun has gone, but there will be other days.  Soon I will be at the  urlLink Friend in Hand  with Amee, soaking up the performance poetry.  I feel excellent.

      It started Friday with the no beers for me tonight my throat hurts I'm getting sick I think I'll have a quiet night, okay just one beer on my way home. Can I have a vodka soda and fresh lemon please, a what? Vodke soda fresh lemon. Eh? Vodka. Soda. Fresh lemon. I make the sign of a lemon with my thumb and index finger and the ageing Greek bartender finally understands. Soon I am drunk enough to be talking about porn and I teach Jess how to use lower case on her mobile which she hasn't been able to do for years, like me until I pressed a key for a few seconds one day and lo and behold A became a and I wasn't shouting at ppl anymore. Shigeki hired out the Stone Wall top floor for his party and by then I was drunk but not too drunk and I was sucking the helium balloons and speaking my best Japanese and there were three heterosexual people in the whole club me being one of them, Boss_Dre_Bro arrived and I finally met his boyfriend and Boss started dancing like R2 Sweetu and we laughed and clinked beers. I met Shingo who is excellent and for a demure Japanese guy he did the best Aussie accent and I guffawed and hilared until my beer sprayed out of other peoples noses and Thirsty and I did air-punches while Shigeki DJ'd.   In the only moment of silence after Shigeki's thankyouforcoming speech I screamed DOMO ARIGATO GOZAIMUSU and surprisingly most of the people (men, gay men) present understood that it meant thankyouverymuch in Japanese and I was thrilled to receive appreciative applause. Dre_Bro was sporting a long sleeved t-shirt with an N on the front and I said what does N stand for and he said I don't know and I suggested N-Drew? And he replied gleefully yes N-Drew cos that's his name you know and I reflected once again what a gorgeous nob my boss is, what a delightful little boy there is in this thirtysomething man, and how funny to see him kiss-kissing and hello-caressing other gay men and his boyfriend.  Then Saturday is wrung through time's squeegie contraption and when it runs dry I am in Bondi, and it is chilly but not too chilly, it's dark and the bitumen is wet from recent rain and I haven't had dinner yet, and I call Cuzzy and say I'm here and he meets me in the mall at the Junction. We head to the cinema to buy movie tickets then wander down to kill time at the pause bar in the Westfield where drinks are overpriced and come with a napkin and table service and too much ebullience. We settle into a comfortable booth, admittedly the lighting is soft and soothing and I feel relaxed in spite of Cuzzy's usual aloofness and he is predictably untalkative and trying oh so hard to be cool and I want to reach out to him and say it's ok, it's just me, but resist, knowing it will make him more ill at ease, so I blabber about my plan to phase out my working life and rediscover my creative pursuits and he dons his mask of indifference, or if not he really is sincerely disinterested in me and my life and my passions, and I sigh internally and wish it could be different. At one point I say this is probably boring to you but I'm really excited about my life right now so I'm just gonna go on about it and I'm thinking  this is my passion, this is MY shit for once, and how often do I listen to you waxing lyrical (or is that wanking) about Good Buddha and how much interest do I show in your endeavours and what do you give me?  Subtle patronisation, even sometimes overt discouragement and are you really that insecure?  And then my heart hurts because I know he hides this even from himself.  Jon and Xan turn up and we go into the cinema and OH MY GOD GO AND SEE SPIDERMAN 2. SEE. SPIDERMAN. 2. Feasty visual delight, I was enraptured for the entire duration and I was moved and aroused and thoroughly entertained and I am in love with Toby Maguire, oh fuck at one point he put on a pair of glasses and I nearly leaked orgasm onto the seat and the floor and the foot of the man sitting next to me, like erotica it was. Most arse-kicking movie I have seen in a long time.  It finishes and the four of us walk back to Cuzzy and Jon's flat, hopping briskly through the light rain though I am smug because I have an umbrella and when I puff it open Xan says oh she came prepared and I say she's always prepared, she carries an umbrella everywhere she goes, that's why she's got a back-pack sutured to her shoulders and she laughs and I simultaneously lament and rejoice my anal pedantic Virgo tendencies. We stop at a service station for some tallyho's. I find a Freddo Frog ice cream cake in the freezer which I desperately want because it has green and pink and yellow layers of ice cream with little chocolate Freddos all the way through it but the boys don't have a freezer and I don't eat ice cream so I resist. Cuzzy seems ever so slightly loosened and I think Jesus you move slowly or am I just impatient?  So I check out their pad and Cuzzy's room is tiny and then we get into Cuzzy's car so that he can drive me home. I feel comfortable and at ease but I know he doesn't quite, I feel bad because of it and wonder if there is anything I can do, even though it's still nice and he's doing quite well but I am a perfectionist and it isn't quite perfect. We stop for some beer and continue to my place, he doesn't feel like drinking beer for once but he has a glass anyway and I make some popcorn with tamari and we head upstairs so we can listen to music and we sit chatting and drinking and munching there on my bed in the bright lamp light. I want very much for him to drink more beer because he lets his guard down but he's reticent so I open the other longneck and pour myself another glass and we natter some more or rather I natter and he does his best to respond and when I jokingly comment on his untalkativeness he doesn't say much in reply. I look at him with wonder and affection and feel a little sad that his walls are rock-solid and I can't penetrate them and I don't think he can either because under his facade he is very, very scared.  His eyes become a little heavy with fatigue and he says I'm gonna have to go soon darlin, and I say yeah I know you look sleepy, and without warning he reaches for me and pulls me in for a hug and I am delighted considering he has avoided touching me all evening. I say oh hello hugs and we squeeze each other and I let myself soak up the affection because it's like an obscure vinyl B-side these days and then I sit up and paint him with one of my biggest smiles. He smiles back and slides a hand up the back of my shirt and softly rubs my back briefly with his warm hand and it feels like coming home and I grin audibly and he gets up to leave.   He puts on his shoes, big black sneakers that remind me of canoes, and then sits on the side of the bed next to where I sit sipping my beer and scoops me into a lovely sideways sitting hug and holds me really close for a while, rubs my back again and caresses my cheek and risks a long look directly into my eyes which pleases me immensely, and moves his hand to the front and grazes my breast and I say don't you dare, and he stops and says sorry and we both laugh. He tries it again and I say firmly don't you fucking dare and I pull away with Teacher Look on my face and say off you go and gesture to the door and he says sorry and I dismiss it with a well you had to try smirk because I know he is testing his boundaries.  Oi, Cuzzy - nuh-ah.  And I see him to the door and he leaves and I feel nice.  Sunday is swallowed by a sleep-in and a two hour private karaoke fest where I bounce about my room playing cheesy retro songs and singing very loudly despite being very hungry but too into the music to eat. Because I exist at the junction between cool and tragic I start with De La Soul and finish with Billy Joel because Matter of Trust is one of my favourite songs because it starts with him singing one, two, one two three four:   Some love is just a lie of the heart The cold remains of what began with a passionate start   I finally get something to eat and settle into my laptop and nearly get started then Amee comes into my room and says do you wanna go to the pub and I say I can't I'm too broke and she says what if I buy and I say let's go.  Aye  I'm on holidays for the next week and a day and  Bee  I know it's because her and Joe have had another fight and she needs to talk, and sure enough she tells me the gist of it while we're standing at the bar before we've even bought our drinks. She un-woes over champagne in the otherwise deserted back room of the Carrington which is maybe five doors down from our house and dangerously accommodating what with its couches and juke box and soft lighting and absence of sport on TV. Rene arrives with a bottle of wine and a glass and we drink and talk and of course the subject of menstruation is covered because Amee is ultra-uterally aware. Trivia starts and soon we leave.  Hey David I just remembered something - I sent Cuzzy a link to your site and he read it and twice said you were a "really good writer" and he is hard to impress so that means you're really really good.  The kitchen is messy and homely and there is popcorn and tamari and babaghanoush and beer and wine. Joe descends eventually but is silent and brooding, makes some food and goes back upstairs and after a while Amee follows him and they stay there for ages and she comes down later with puffy eyes. We sit in the music room while Amee plays MP3s, us three girls wailing like junkie buskers in Central Station underpass to "Especially For You" and Robbie Williams and other travesties, Joe enters with another infernal Cognac Trumpet and we all have some puffs and feel thirsty. I am bouncy, in party mode. The others are entering End of Weekend mode and I become slightly listless because I am free tomorrow so I want the night to go on longer so I call Cuzzy to chat and once again he is restrained and unaccommodating but I ignore it and chatter away anyway and he seems to settle into the conversation and my joviality but after the fifth or sixth lighthearted comment that is rebounded at me with his supercilious finger-up-arse chilliness I finally say look, goodbye.  How can one man be so capable and intelligent and genuine, and yet so clueless about how to treat a woman?  I am admirably undisturbed by this encounter. Merely disappointed, and sympathetic.  And now I am on holidays and can curl up in my soft bed safe in the knowledge that tomorrow belongs to me - and the next day, and the next, and the one after that, and then another one, plus one more. Fukn bliss.

      She came to the door in that long brown leather coat that used to be mum's. She looks down a lot. Big, sad eyes. Quick tour of the house. You should put a herb garden here. I know, it's just too cold at the moment. Washing hangs on the line, damp in the drizzle, odd socks and underpants and teatowels. Her sneakers meet straight denim jeans, long hair in a low ponytail, teeth smacking around chewing gum. Upstairs we are. She laughs at my penis. I press play. Where's J? He's taking books back to the library. How is he? He's an arsehole fuckwit. I immediately feel terrible, remembering the way mum would talk about him, and I would say please, I don't want to hear it, I don't want to hear my mum talk about people that way no matter how bad he is for her. How's his place? It's awful, just a room, he hates it and so do I. Why is he there then? He can't afford anything else. Is he working? Oh, every now and then he gets a shift, but he's too scared to look for work, he's been to prison. So? So he's scared he'll get fired as soon as they find out. So what? That's what I said, fucking arsehole. I wince again. I hate to hear people speak of boyfriends girlfriends close friends with a toxic vitriolic tongue. I think it belongs in thoughts, maybe diaries, but not out loud to others. It coats the breath in sulphur and smells rancid.  I walk her to the door and look at her properly, chocolate eyes like big sleepy beetles, face that looks so much like mine now that we're both older. Quite beautiful, she is. She chews her gum and talks of defeat and disappointment, shifts nervously. Oh sister, be happy. I trudge upstairs to shake myself free of shadows.

      So, I was going to go to the second heat of the Leichhardt Poetry Competition tonight, but I had the day off work (again - why do I bother?) because I was sickish (it's the aircon, I know it makes me sick) and I decided to ingnore the persistant semiconscious nagging to go out somewhere, instead spending my nightn at home with Rene, Amee, Joe and Jonnie, until the latter three left to see Dizzy Rascal at the Gaelic Club, and Rene left with Emma to go to work at Home nightclub. So now it's just me and you, whoever you are. I have drunk and I put my $2.40 change in my pink papier mache piggy bank and I intend to watch the  Toxic Avenger  tonight and so there.   For anyone who doesn't know, Smirnoff Blacks have 7% alcohol per volume and are therefore very good value in spite of tasting rank. I will have you know that each and every word I have typed thus far has rendered a correction of the back-spacing variety necessary. To prove my point I shall ignore all typing errors from here. Now this is very fooog dvalue in terms of alochool if tou consider that most mixwed drinks are around 5% concentration per vomueoine, so a Smirnoff Balck will get you pised ifn nhalf the time for the same pricwe. I receoomend them to anyone who wants a cheap thrill aned who hates beer, thoguth they taste shity and coat your teethe in an awful sugary fristionc. I hate vodka with lime. I thoroguthly dislike the lime cordial they use in pubs, much prefeerring the fake verdant lime cordial they seelll in siupermarkets amnufactured by cottees:   My dad picks his nose  That goes to Snottees  To make the Boogie Balls  That I like Best   Hey did anyone else's dad try to throw them out of home for voting Greens instead of labor?   Tongiht I had two plans: to go to the sedcond poetry heat for the&nbsp;Leichhardt Petry Comp, and to the free Good Buddha&nbsp;gig in Bondi, but foprtunately and tracgically neigrtther will eventuate because of&nbsp;commitments to my own apathy and Seasonal Affective Disorder. I&nbsp;seriosuly get the&nbsp;winter blues. I only begin to function n ormally when the weather gers warm again. Threee months ogf my life are a loss, and why? To waht can I attribute such an unfortunate malady? My heritage? No. I am 12.5 % Chinese and the rest of me is ANglo trash. Why would I be unusally susceptible to cold? My environemtnt? Having lived in SYdney all my life one would thing I could tolerate the seaosns, perhapes freaking out when dealing with harsher climetess such as winter in melbourne, but&nbsp; NO. I freak out in Syndey. I looked up the sypmtoms of&nbsp;S.A.D. on the internet a couple of years ago and&nbsp;they described me with alarming accuracy. From craving simpkle carbs (sugar, chocolate) to fdeelinf inexplicably down and unmoitvatedd in cold weather. In my mind, people just aren;t meatnt o fuction in cold weather,&nbsp;rahter, we are meatn to hivbnernate like bears.   I think I should stop tyoing now berofere I give everyone lysdexia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      So yesterday Cuzzy sends me an email that says, “I want to bring you presents. Will you be home tonight?” I slip quietly inside myself to see if that is alright with me, and am grateful to find a still calm of the  don’t mind if ya do, don’t mind if ya don’t  variety (love that shit). &nbsp;I reply in the affirmative. He will drive over in the evening.   I’m at home marinating tofu when he calls to say he’ll leave after he eats something, so I say “Well I’m just about to make some food if you want to come over for dinner.” I make a satay spinach and tofu stir-fry, sipping Malibu and cola. I finish it before he arrives, load some onto a plate of rice, dip my finger in some of the peanut sauce in the pan and lick it, and settle onto the couch to eat. Thursday is a quiet evening at my house. Rene goes to Design College, Amee goes to Spanish, and Joe probably goes to the pub. By the time I hear Cuzzy’s heavy footsteps on the porch I am nearly finished my food.   He knocks. I settle my plate on the couch beside me and swing the front door open, smiling. He looks at me for a good five seconds, his eyes set on sincerity just the way I like them – round like saucers with his eyebrows slightly raised for maximum perception, and I wonder if he realizes he’s stuck in stare mode, and I know it’s because he’s assessing my mood and whether he should feel awkward, which I find utterly adorable and sweet, so he only hesitates for a moment in the doorway, probably somewhat relieved that things seem okay. He hamburgers me in one of his meaty hugs. We swing from side to side with that  oh it’s good to see you  affection, and I push the door closed behind him. “Here you go,” he says, and hands me two mix CDs and a copy of  Rush  Magazine which he had grabbed from the Co-op where he works, because one of the contributors is Justin Heazlewood and he knows I am a fan.   “Thanks!” I answer, taking my goodies. I am honestly touched. Cuz doesn’t give me presents very often but when he does they are thoughtful and delightful. The last thing he gave me was a book called “The Superior Person’s Second Book of Words” and is basically a book of obscure, wonderful, big&nbsp;words, and is so  Me  that I would have chosen it myself if I had discovered it earlier. Check this:    Do you ever feel like an acephalous dandripat? Want to animadvert with anfractous brimborions? Have you ever simply felt unable to dapatically deblaterate to the best of your ability? Then here is the book for you!    Is that not wonderful?   So I’m flicking through the  Rush  issue, which is a student life publication sponsored by the Co-op bookshop, checking out the names of the contributors, when I exclaim, “Cuzzy! You’re even more excellent than you thought! You’ve managed to get me a copy of Rush that has bits not only from Justin, but from two of my Uni friends – Ghita Loebenstein and Lee Tran Lam, and the one and only Vanessa Berry!” I quickly turned to Vanessa’s page to find that she is the resident “Agony Aunt”! Go Berry!   Cuz looks down to his food, chewing, and looks slightly proud, which is quite a feat for him because his face barely changes, ever. You have to be really in tune to his subtleties to have a clue what he’s thinking. But I can tell he feels a little bit good, and my eyes smile at him and my heart silently shoots a little love dart straight into his.   We finish eating and I pour myself some more Malibu. “What did you think of my zine? Was it too harsh on you?”   “Not at all,” he said. “What are you drinking?”   “Malibu and cola.”   “You’re drinking alone?”   “I only have two cans. I had a horrible day. I needed a drink. A nice drink." He knows I rarely drink alone. I find it quite pointless. I take a sip. It is wonderful and sweet. Caffeinated coconut rum. Yum.&nbsp; "Jonnie has been sending me really nice texts about my zine.”   “Yeah, he thinks it’s unreal! He came out of his room after he’d been reading it, and he said, ‘What do you think of Gem’s zine?’ and I couldn’t quite tell if he was asking because he liked it. I said ‘It’s great. It’s well-written and honest.’ He said ‘It’s really good. It’s  really  good.’ I think you nailed it with that bit about him. I think he read it and thought, oh my god. She gets me!"    Relevant Excerpt:     Jonnie arrives in one of his moods. You can tell straight away when Jonnie has the shits.&nbsp; You can see the steam rising from his head like a fresh hot turd. Nothing sums up a Scorpio better than that nursery rhyme about the little girl with the little curl in the middle of her forehead:    When they are good, they're very, very good,  But when they are bad, they're fucking horrid!    I cautiously slink toward Jonnie as he leans against our kitchen bench complaining about having to drive and not being able to drink, and go to offer him a hug. "What's wrong, Jon?" I laugh and put my arms around him. He grabs me by the wrists and holds my arms away from him so that I am unceremoniously halted mid-embrace.   "Nothing, fuck off you skank hoe." This is Jonniespeak for  sorry, I'm in a bad mood.    "What? I just want to give you a hug!"   " I don't want to hug you."   I refrain from being offended, knowing that next time I see him he will give me an apologetic grin and watch my reaction to see if he's forgiven and I will smile back and call him a moody cunt and tell him  lucky I love you cos you're such a cunt sometimes  and he will giggle and hug me and say  I love you Gem, I really do .   &nbsp;  “Oh, Jonnie!” I put my hand over my heart and let my smile make the kitchen a little brighter. “Of course I ‘get’ him. He’s simple once you figure him out.”   Upstairs Cuzzy puts on a couple of songs from his new Flaming Lips CD. We sit on my bed and talk for a while. I like the way he is looking at me today. Not a trace of aloofness or uncertainty, just plain old Cuzzy, and me. I wonder whether I am in control of the way things are between us, or if it depends on the two of us, and the stars, and what we had for dinner. I realized in that moment that I need to stop reassessing the entire situation in light of whatever happened the instance before. There seems to be a loose pattern of two-times-good, one-time-bad in operation when we see each other, and each time it’s good I think things are going to be wonderful from then on, and each time it’s bad I think we’re doomed. It’s bound to be a bit rocky. From now on, sometimes it shall be heavenly, and sometimes it shall be wet poo on the pillow, and that shall be that.   He leaves to organize some Good Buddha stuff. We hug again at the front door, wrapping it all up the same way it started, swaying in a long hug, squeezing tight. He walks out into the cold night and I feel nice.

      Blogger is having issues. Now that I can finally post I can't include links or italics or bold. It feels archaic without emphasis. I think I will have to edit this when Blogger feels better.    My copy of  American Psycho  was lying open and face down on the kitchen table this morning. Rene or Dollface must be reading it. I rarely read books twice, which is a shame because the details of stories often fizzle quickly into crumbs and all I am usually left with is a feeling of having liked it, loved it, or no clue what it was about – I reason that there are so many books in the world that to re-read a book is to rob myself of new book-reading-moments, but  American Psycho  breaks both of these tendencies in that the story is still lucid in my mind, and is one that I will make a special effort to read again. I absolutely loved it. The skill with which side-splitting humour is combined with heart-hammering, nauseating, graphic horror is almost beyond my scope of comprehension. It sent me on a Brett Easton Ellis bender. I think I have read them all. I especially liked  The Rules of Attraction.    One of my favourite things to do in the whole entire world is read a book and then see its corresponding movie. The pleasure of watching characters and settings I have become so close to and involved with come to life on a screen can only be likened to waking one morning to discover a miniature chocolate vending machine mysteriously and permanently inserted into the skin on the inside of my wrist. The anticipation when I am nearing the end of a novel knowing that there is a movie to watch afterward makes my eyelids twitch and flutter with excitement, even though&nbsp;the movies are usually&nbsp; a little disappointing. And the movie is never as good as the book. And if the director deviates too heavily from the plot or changes or omits one of the characters, it is sometimes a cause of great rage or disappointment where I fly into my version of men yelling at football games on TV. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME? DON’T YOU KNOW HOW IT’S DONE? THIS IS A TRAVESTY!”   The one film I really thought did justice to its book was  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas . Hey – there’s a book I actually read twice! Sometimes when lines from movies are really memorable they become a part of my semi-conscious internal dialogue, such as, “We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold,” which I regurgitate at appropriate moments, as well as “Scoot over you fat bastard,” much to the offence of people who don’t realize I’m simply quoting Hunter S. The scene in the hotel room after Hunter S and his lawyer have ingested all manner of ridiculous substances (including human adrenaline) where everything is submerged in a pool of fetid water and Hunter has a crocodile’s tail strapped to his arse and a microphone strapped to his head and a mere sprinkling of vague memories of the night before, has me howling and wiping my eyes every time I watch it.   Another one that was well done was  The Cider House Rules  by John Irving. Oh, Toby Maguire.   I was talking about this recently to someone, and they raised a good point: the books that translate best to film are the skinny books. Tis True. There aren’t too many details that have to be jettisoned from skinny books.   My most recent book-to-film adventure was, of course,  Requiem For A Dream.  I saw Requiem at the movies when it came out a couple of years ago, was absolutely blown away, came out thinking that was the best movie since  Big Trouble in Little China , and never saw it again until last weekend, specifically because the credits at the end of the movie said it was based on the book by Hubert Selby Jr, which was news to me, and having read  Last Exit To Brooklyn  and loved it, I immediately set out on a search for the novel of Requiem. Six weeks later my order arrived from the USA at Collins, I excitedly went straight down to buy it, realized they had incorrectly ordered the screenplay, and left, disappointed. A long time later I managed to get one through Dymcocks, finished reading it last week, and finally watched the movie again on video. After the book it seemed tame and short and comparatively hollow. I could hardly believe that it was the same movie that had captured and stunned and shocked and belted me upside the head a couple of years ago. Not that the movie was lacking. The book was just much  more .   The most striking thing about this transition was the modernisation in the movie. While Sarah Goldfarb’s story of diet pill addiction is well represented in the film, the characters of Harry, Marion and Tyrone are changed to reflect modern drug culture. Their downward spiral in the movie centres around unspecified white drugs that might be cocaine, or speed, or pills: but in the novel they become ensnared in the sickness of heroin addiction. To me that alteration brought about a massive change in the energy of the movie, but one that I saw was necessary so as not to be a movie about heroin, but rather about addiction. You throw heroin into the mix of a film and it steals the focus.   So I’m watching the movie with the careful eye of one who knows the book and will be judging it pedantically. I kept waiting to feel what I felt the first time, and what I felt in the book, but the displacement of the story into the ‘now-ish’ stole away the depravity, the desperation, the panic and terror and confusion and utter helplessness of sinking into junk addiction. Uppers and rave drugs rarely move people to the same level of dependency as heroin, thus is was hard to swallow the goriest scene in the film, where Harry’s arm swells and welts around a hideous open vein from sticking a needle into the same spot over and over, finally festers and breaks and goes gangrenous, requiring amputation. The novel qualifies it perfectly. I was fascinated to have responded to Hubert Selby’s vivid description with more horror and revulsion and emotion than I did when it was actually shown in graphic close-up on the film.   That doesn’t mean it was a let-down. It’s still a damn good movie. As in the book, the story of Sarah Goldfarb – Harry’s mother – runs parallel to that of Harry, Marion and Tyrone. She is prescribed diet pills and innocently takes her dose as instructed, essentially lives on three tabs of amphetamine per day and one sleeping pill at night, gradually develops hysterical paranoia with delusions and hallucinations, progresses to a valium addiction to counteract the speed, is handed over to a cruel and misguided doctor who submits her for shock treatment, and like the other three characters meets her demise: Happy Ending’s antithesis. No happy here. Here no happy. It will either bring you to tears or make you feel ill or at least shut you up for a minute. Sarah’s character is extremely well cast, well played, and well adapted. My heart blackened and shrivelled in the scene where Harry realizes his mother is wired after hearing her quietly grinding her teeth.   Essentially, Requiem is an exploration of addiction. It admirably manages to escape a tendency toward either didacticism or glorification, sitting neutrally at the junction, merely visiting the lives of four ordinary people who became victims of simple substances with powers greater than any of them anticipated. What a horrendous, brilliant piece of literature. If you have seen the movie, or heard about it, or not, please read the book.

          My Nan went to buy her and mum a coffee a few years ago. She asked for "Two cups of chino."   Nan doesn't watch movies, she watches "fillums."   To Nan, all breakfast cereal is "cornflakes."   She once talked about "That show on TV, with all the lawyers. Lay Law."   She will scorn any semblance of a swear word, but will shamelessly screech "Get to buggery!"   She only remembers my name after trying out the names of both of my siblings. To Nan, I am "Sh, er Mit, er Gem."   Nans are so cool.   		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink Vote for the stars of Yahoo!'s next ad campaign!

       I kind of regret one of my posts. It was written when I was kind of angry slash hurt slash emotional. I think I used the phrase "fucking idiot." When I read over it today it seemed utterly incongruous with my current frame of mind - a ranty tantrum almost. I know it was how I honestly felt at the time, but...   &nbsp;   Hey, I honestly felt that way at the time. And this is my journal. Post stays.   &nbsp;   Maybe I shouldn't write when I feel bothered. At least, not about the thing slash person slash situation that has bothered me. Hey, why not? If I'm bothered I shall write botheredly.   &nbsp;   There's that latent bipolar slash schizophrenia slash pathological indecisiveness rising to the fore.

       Ever had that problem where your tongue piercing makes the roof of your mouth all sore?   &nbsp;   The best thing about having a pole of steel shoved through your mouth muscle is that taking it out feels very, very weird. Suddenly your tongue is free to flick in and out of your mouth unheeded, giving you the feeling of vast amounts of space. Your bauble-less tongue feels naked and half-baked. I have only taken my piercing out a few times over the years and I always take full advantage by rubbing my tongue all over my lips, sticking it out as far as it will go, and snapping it back in again. Small things...   &nbsp;   There's another cool thing you can do if you have a labret piercing. The labret is the part just below your bottom lip. If you take the rod out and fill the inside bottom part of your mouth with water (or red wine for a more spectacular effect) then purse your lips tightly and push, the liquid will come daintily squirting out the hole. Fun for some, repulsive to others. I am one of those people who is amused by the same things they are repulsed by, and I find this system works well for me in most facets of my life. If poo is funny to you, you will always have an advantage.   		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink Vote for the stars of Yahoo!'s next ad campaign!

       How rude. I actually have to fist a pair of gloves and stick my neck inside a scarf to go outside. Frankly, winter is a redundant idea that some weathergod on acid invented at The Beginning of Time and I thank him not. Winter would be the first thing I would eradicate if I could go back in time. The nerve! This morning my ears felt like giant frozen warts. My cheeks turned pink from the effort of thermostatic maintenance. A crazed bearded man, who was maniacally sprinkling tobacco onto a tally ho as fast as the wind could blow it away, muttered to me at the&nbsp;crossing "Friggin cold this mornin', whaddya reckon darlin?" and I was too cold to reply. I had wrapped my long fluffy blue scarf around my face so that only my eyes and forehead showed. I saw no sense in undoing my shield only to say "yes."   &nbsp;   Then I briefly imagined stripping off and running down Oxford Street in my acqua undies and bra (they are matching today!) hollering&nbsp;"Who's cold now who's cold now who's cold now I am!" and scoffed to myself behind my woolly face muff and kept marching with the Corporate Soldiers. Walking to work in the morning, and home in the evening, is a neverending tetris where I must slot myself in wherever space becomes available before any other competitor beats me there, and immediately assess what my next move should be and how quickly I have to launch myself to achieve success. I yearn for a pocket filled with explosives which I can use to launch at the area ahead of me to rip open a series of Gem-shaped holes to pave my way through the throngs.   &nbsp;   For years I have also fantasized about automatic retractable roller wheels on my belly that appear on command so that I can dive to the ground and slide along on my front like a human skateboard whenever walking fails to be fast enough, or exciting enough. I'm working on it.   		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink Vote for the stars of Yahoo!'s next ad campaign!

      So, it's Monday. I have adopted my Writing Pose again. Instead of my usual sleeping dress and psychedelic flares I am wearing my comfie karate pants and&nbsp;a soft grey long-sleeved top,&nbsp; the usual slippers on my feet,&nbsp;next to the usual heater having just eaten some yummies while perusing blogs, as usual. My zine is finished (hooray! Upjumps and Yay Dances) and is so bloody phat I had to staple the first batch in two halves and stick the middle bit inside the outer bit. When I copied the second lot the next day, I folded each individual page in the hopes that they would be compressed enough to get a stapler through, and they sort of were - I ended up with those little peekaboo bits of staples sticking through, which reminded me of eight fingernails on the top of a brick wall straining to pull up a person dangling on the other side. For safe measures I then turned it over and put some staples on the inside fold as well.  &nbsp;  What a weird and random weekend. I'm still not sure if it was good or bad. I guess time will tell. I visited the Ovary Boys (ie, they're twins) on Friday night on my way to the Sly Fox and had a good chuckle with them in their big dark warehouse. When I left I couldn't get rid of a craving for Caramel Crown chocolate biscuits&nbsp;which has been pestering me for a while now, ever since Cuzzy mentioned them on the phone a while ago. I stopped in at IGA on King Street and bought some, munching them on my way down Enmore Road, and by the time I got to Shane's farewell at the Sly Fox I had eaten three quarters of the packet. The pub was packed and noisy and I realized I didn't feel like being there at all, and having spent all my money at Kinko's photocopying I had no money for booze or, for that matter, transport home. I gave out some of my new zines, hugged Shane goodbye, and unceremoniously left maybe ten minutes after I'd arrived, wondering why I felt so utterly antisocial. Then it occurred to me:  The biscuits. They have wheat in them.  Duh. I'm used to being able to tolerate wheat in small doses. I guess three quarters of a packet isn't a small dose.  &nbsp;  So I walked back to Surry Hills. I have done the walk between Newtown and Surry&nbsp;numerous times now even though it takes an hour because living in Surry Hills where it's close to everything has put me into the healthy habit of walking. It was a nice night. I was home by 10:30 and I spent the night tucked up, reading. Bliss.  &nbsp;  But Saturday? That's when things got weird.  &nbsp;  We were drinking at the Carrington - Amee, Joe, Suchy and I, when Nath called and said "we're gonna come and meet you guys."  &nbsp;  "Cool bro, I've got a zine for you. See you soon."  &nbsp;  I sort of assumed Nath meant Jonnie when he said "we." Turns out he meant Cuzzy.  &nbsp;  He walked in and I felt yucky. Last week, after having had enough of his thirteen-year-old-ness, I told him he was being "unsupportive, difficult, belittling and transparent" and chose to avoid him for those reasons, responding to his emails politely but curtly, explaining that I didn't hate him but found his attitude unpleasant and trying, which he responded to with genuine remorse and apology, and again with that annoying "I understand" tone that bores me so, because it isn't enough to just 'understand,' there needs to be active follow-up. He kissed me and sat beside me there near the pool table and I was accommodating without being warm, and when we left he linked my arm but I ignored it and kept walking. He and Nath were heading to Fletch's party on Cleveland St. We passed my place and they came in and Cuzzy asked for a drink of water and I said "sure" and left the kitchen and he got his own water. They left. Suchy and Joe left a while later and headed to the Gaelic Club. Amee and I watched Requiem For a Dream.  &nbsp;  After the movie I was still drinking beer and really really felt like going out, after all it was going to be a long weekend for me, my holiday stretching into Monday, but the weather was deplorable: blowing a gale, freezing and raining, and Amee had gone to bed, so I called Nath and asked what he was up to and how the party was and couldn't he come over and keep me company but by then he was at the Judgement Bar with Nash which is only a ten minute walk away and I would have happily gone had it been a nice night.  &nbsp;  It must have been 2:30 or 3 when I decided that it would be a good idea to call Cuzzy and tell him to come over. Me alone and drunk is a bad idea, because I need to be around people. I guess Cuzzy was a last resort. I knew he was around the corner. I was sitting next to the phone. I wasn't thinking properly. I don't think I was thinking at all. After four or five phone calls between us, a couple of "I'll call you back" s on his part, one hangup ( him hanging up on me that is), two voice messages and a couple of text messages, he grudgingly and drunkenly acquiesced and said "see you soon." Soon he was wiping his feet at the door - freezing and wet and on the verge of passing out, headed straight to my bed and got under the covers, shaking. I had to laugh. I felt no remorse at having demanded he come over. I considered it to be the metaphorical equivalent of a very small part of the mental expenditure I had invested in him.  &nbsp;  So we sat and chatted, or slurred rather, and it was very good-natured, and I insisted he sleep on the couch and he insisted he wouldn't, and in spite of myself I laughed again, and after a while we were hugging, and somehow I was wriggling on top of him and we were giggling and taking off each other's clothes. I don't remember deciding to have sex with him. I don't remember thinking "I shouldn't" when it started. I remember that it was fantastic, noisy, multiple-position sex, and at one point he moved me forward and banged my head hard on the bedhead which hurt like hell for a minute. I have a lump on my forehead.  &nbsp;  By the time we went to sleep it was 6:3am. We woke up at around 2. Went to Maya where he bought me a Masala Dosa. I told him how it is for women: how you can't sleep with us and then take off the next day acting like nothing happened. "Even though I wanted to fuck you as much as you wanted to fuck me, the difference is that today I still want to be around you. I want to feel like it  meant  something and was more than a couple of bodies rolling around. I'm your friend, I love you, I want you to let me in, but - "  &nbsp;  " - but I don't know how." He took my hand in between his, and looked at me for a long time with that unreadable poker face.  &nbsp;  "Are you going to say something?" I asked. He shook his head. I didn't think so.  &nbsp;  You know what the worst thing was? After I gently told him that I was vulnerable to this particular thing, his nonchalance after we accidentally sleep together, a couple of tears escaping down my face there in the restaurant as cheesy Indian film clips played on the big screens, he nodded understandingly, but I knew he was still going to go home. He had a football game to watch. He had Foxtel to think about.  &nbsp;  My house was on the way to his bus stop so we walked there in silence. I was brewing. I felt resentment. I didn't want to make an issue of it because...just because.&nbsp; He came inside to borrow a scarf. He sat beside me on the bed. He hugged me. My eyes stung. They started to drip. Helpless, I let them. My heart hurt. It was maybe the third time he had seen me cry: once when my Pop died; when we broke up; and now. He pulled me closer and I hugged him back. I looked through the wetwall of tears to my fists there on his back which looked tiny, childlike, against his big brown jacket. He stroked my face. I cried some more. I cried for every moment I hadn't let myself cry. It felt good to be vulnerable for once. Disarming, but relieving.  &nbsp;  "Andy?"  &nbsp;  "Yeah?"  &nbsp;  "I need you today. For the first time, I need you to stay."  &nbsp;  He nodded and hugged me tighter and pulled me down on the bed with me still in his arms and we lay there quietly with the heater on, me sniffing a little, and he was warm and big, and soon we were dozing, just slept there for a while. I felt immensely better.  &nbsp;  Realized how much I am still carrying Gravy around with me. Whenever I got upset, Gravy would become inconsolably angry, and I guess I learned to try not to make a big deal of things. I keep reminding myself that Cuzzy is different but old habits die hard.  &nbsp;  Later, he left. I slept from 6pm till 11am this morning with the aid of a sleeping pill at 4am. I am wondering if my reaction yesterday means I feel more for him than I realize, or if it's just another hurt-pride issue. I am wondering if it was a good thing, or not so good. I'm wondering if I should just stop wondering about it. I guess if it made me confused that means it was bad. I'd like to know what Cuz thinks, but I know he won't be able to tell me, because he doesn't know himself.  &nbsp;  A couple of times he has said to me, "Thankyou for understanding me better than I understand myself." It's true, I often do. That's inconceivable to me, the thought of someone understanding me better than I do. It would just never happen. When&nbsp;Joe asked him how Fletch's party had been he said, "It was weird. I didn't seem to be able to hold a conversation with anyone. I just wanted to get out of there."  &nbsp;  I thought, you fucking idiot, that's because I wasn't responding to you at the pub. Can't you admit to yourself that I affect you? How can you not understand why you felt weird? How can you be so removed from yourself? How can your defences be so thick that even you can't see past them?  &nbsp;  Open it up and let it bleed, my cold Tabula Rasa. Let love in.

      I was going to write about my utterly strange, goodbad weekend, but that has taken a back seat after  urlLink what I just read in Metal City  because I felt the need to respond in my token long-winded manner. For those who haven’t read this entry,  urlLink David  is undergoing a quarterlife crisis typical of us twentysomethings who have emerged from one era of our lives, seemingly into nothing. It’s that eerie period of moratorium where you expect that the efforts you have made for your first quarter-century should have started to pay off by now but nothing seems to be happening and panic sets in and you feel like the last 5-10 years have all been in aid of nothing and that you’ll have to start all over again doing something you absolutely don’t want to do. The feeling is all-too familiar to me, and my flatmate Amee, and my other flatmate Rene, and probably Joe as well though I haven’t asked him…anyone else?  &nbsp;  It seems like David’s situation is mine in reverse. I studied psychology at Uni because I ignored the thing inside me that said “The thing I most like to do is write”, opting for a more ‘solid’ degree that might take me somewhere. I despised statistics (a requirement for psych) so much that I questioned why I was still living with my parents in a suburb that bored me to depression to afford to study a subject that I was interested in, but ultimately not enough: but I persevered, until I couldn’t bear it any longer. After three years of full-time study I fucked off two weeks before the end of semester, went travelling around the North Coast (of NSW and a bit of QLD) for six weeks, broke up with my boyfriend of three years (whatsis name…), &nbsp;moved to Newtown with Rene when I was 21 and she was 18, got on the dole, got a two casual jobs – one of which was cash-in-hand,&nbsp; met more people than I ever knew existed, and the boy who was to steal my heart.  &nbsp;  Living in a sharehouse changed my life. I was broke – we all were, but I was as free as one could be who relied on Centrelink for their money. I obediently did everything they asked: spent six hours with the yellow pages filling in my dole diary – twice – and twice they never even asked for it; visited my Mutual Obligation Case Worker fortnightly, who was thankfully extremely cool.&nbsp;By this stage I was back at Uni part-time studying creative writing (finally!) and cultural studies, so he gave me money for clothes (“so you have something to wear to job interviews – I bought a selection of funky rags), provided me with brown travel tens (“to get to Uni and back”), and generally stayed off my case (literally) for the duration of my studies. One of the few angels of Centrestink. I was never eligible for Austudy you see. Daddy, who I haven’t seen or spoken to for a couple of years now, and whose favourite I certainly wasn't, earned too much money, and they thought that was relevant, even if he and mum weren’t together anymore.  &nbsp;  But studying part-time meant I could still work and get a little extra money. In my final year I discovered distance education, and did better than I ever had because I wasn’t wasting three hours and countless dollars per day on transport, and I could do it in my own time and post off my assignments. Being a student was good (6.5 years for a BA? Jesus. When people ask, I automatically qualify this truth by saying “but I did half a degree in psych then changed, and then I had to go part-time cos I couldn’t get Austudy to go full-time…”). But as it drew to a close I was faced by the impending doom of uncertainty, and lack of goals. &nbsp;I had already spent so much time at Uni that doing any post-grad stuff would just delay the overseas travel I wanted to do and the money I wanted to have and the forward motion I craved. Doing the same thing for that long is bound to make one yearn for change.  &nbsp;  So I decided to work in a bookstore “until I find something better.” I wanted money. I started as a full-time casual at  Basement Books  until I realized after about eight months of working there that as a casual I was actually entitled to more money than they were paying me, consulted the relevant authorities, did some calculations, and quit – sent them a letter demanding the $850 they owed me, which I am proud to say they paid: and not only that, they raised the wages of all my colleagues and paid them $100 in ‘sorry for our error’ (and shut up) money.&nbsp; Yay Gem. That took care of my debts. Now for the savings. Inevitably, with my sudden increase in income, my poor-struggling-student lifestyle had become a comfortable and woo-hoo-party lifestyle and I managed not to save anything until Gravy moved into my bedroom. We split the rent for a year and then split up. A couple of months after he moved out, I took my savings to Asia where I spent six weeks with Jonnie, Nath, Darvida, Suchy and Maya, had the time of my life, arrived back in Sydney homeless and jobless with a $2000 credit card debt.  &nbsp;  I stayed at mum’s and worked at market research while I looked for work. I silenced the thought of getting a satisfying job that involved writing because a BA means very little with no solid experience behind it, and I needed money NOW because travelling to and from Dundas (which is a buttfuck suburb about 30 mins drive from Sydney if it’s 2am on a Tuesday but otherwise is more like 50 mins and on transport it’s more like an hour and a half) and living with my mum and brother was only good when I considered how much disposable income I had. For those few months I felt somewhat loose and free: sleeping on a different friend’s couch every night, eating out for every single meal, shouting everyone drinks, drinking until late on weeknights, staying up for the whole weekend, etc. But every time I had to go back to Dundas for a change of clothes I felt miserable. I am a city girl at heart. Plus, carrying my back pack full of clothes and toiletries everywhere was becoming very tiresome. And I didn’t have ‘my place’ where I could just sit around and make collages or cook food (except in Dundas where I would have to drive mum’s car to the shop) or chill out in between things. I wouldn’t have been able to deal with it had I not come back from travelling around Asia. I simply prolonged the momentum and stayed in travel-mode.  &nbsp;  So I got a job at Dymcocks, eventually. In the store. Fucking retail. I will never do that again. If someone pisses me off, I do not – cannot, smile and take it. I am neither obsequious or servile. I have trouble seeing myself as a representative of a company or identifying with its ethic or system: merely a paid pawn that grudgingly does its job. So I decided to work in the website office in the building above the store and moved back into Sydney's Inner West. I'm still working at the Online office, in the physical world. In my mind I have already moved on and am merely waiting for reality to catch up.  &nbsp;  The way I see it, David’s imbroglio is Gem’s spelt backwards. I ignored my passion in favour of working meaningless, monotonous jobs, utterly reticent to move on to better-paying menial jobs because, and I have only just realized this, I have no interest in working toward such a career. I have subconsciously held myself back from pursuing a higher position in the corporate sector because my writing, which I had downgraded to the category of ‘hobby’, is ultimately where I like my energy to go. Having a job that could ‘take me somewhere’ would mean more responsibility, more pressure, more adhering to dumb corporate expectations, more conservatism, more fake professionalism, a series of half-arsed Community College certificates, and less mental reserve for writing. I struggle with money and debts but essentially I have enough to get by. Recently I realized that things had to happen in the order they did. I needed a full-time job to get a great house with my superb friends in a fantastic Sydney suburb. I needed it to get a loan to buy my excellent laptop and all her associated peripherals so that I can write properly and get online. I needed to pay off my credit card (oops, how did I clock up another $1000?). I needed to have enough money to realize that in the end, I’d rather be broke and creative than comfortable and stunted.  &nbsp;  So my point is David, that the reality of being a talented writer is that no matter what, you will always be a talented writer. Nothing except death or maybe paralysis will take that away from you. Also, you can’t expect to never have to work in a stupid boring job that disregards your talents and pays you in exchange for your time, unless you are very very lucky. Despite hating it and feeling like you aren’t going anywhere, what you do is you talk to the people you work with, and hand them something dumb like a little zine, and they read it and are affected by you, and in their mind you are The Writer Who Is Here Until Something Comes Up, and when they hear about other writers, they will say “Oh, David X who I work with is a writer,” and that person will say “Oh really, can you get him to give me a call? We need a writer,” and things will start to happen, all because you spread the word a little. The other thing is, changing your environment can bring about an amazing metamorphosis. I know your life at home is really nice and causes you no problems, but as soon as you’re not living with your parents you realize you can bring girls home and fuck them senseless, and if you’re in the city you can step around the corner for a beer or ten and not worry about having to drive, and if you live with flatmates you get to meet all of their friends, meanwhile you’re spreading the word and handing out zines or cards with your site address on them and people are starting to go “Man this guy is really good” and you will feel alive and encouraged despite your dumb job because people are reading your stuff and responding to it and you know while you’re at work that the boringness pays for your rent so you can keep meeting people and spreading the word.  &nbsp;  I think if you look at in terms of “it had to happen this way” it will seem less like a stifling lockdown, and more like the beginning of the next stage. You had to go to Uni and fine-hone your skills and then arrive at that humungous intimidating question mark because you got your studies out of the way first, and now you can start the next part of your life with the best foundation you could have given yourself.  &nbsp;  You could swallow your pride and beg at Centrelink? They can’t cut you off without good reason. I actually want to go back to Centrelink and use their stupid Mutual Obligation to my advantage by volunteering somewhere wonderful and relevant. You can do that you know – and the sky is the limit, because wherever you volunteer won’t have to pay you. Bang. There’s your experience. Everybody wins. I can't yet because if I quit my job I won't be eligible. But  you ...  &nbsp;  You know how I mention my epiphany every now and then? The crux of it is, I have realized that writing and reading make me happy beyond everything, and if I never make money from it or get published, I will be happy as long as I keep doing it. Involving myself in things like writing festivals and zine fairs and performance poetry makes me happy, so I will keep doing it. I will try to phase out my dumb job and see how it goes but if it doesn’t work out, I will keep following my passion. Even if I suck, I don’t give a shit. It has become all about the love itself rather than what it can do for me and where it can lead me. And I think that if you have that attitude, things will just happen without you even trying. But you need to get out and be amongst people. That’s the second most important thing, after a love of writing.  &nbsp;  Am I being didactic? I hope not, I’m just sharing this with you David, and everyone reading this, in the hope that you don’t disregard this wonderful talent you have, just because of idiot postgrad supervisers and mentally ill Centrelink workers and your own inner critic. I’ve had enough of mine. I have a sense of humour that allows me to laugh at almost anything, especially myself, and I think if you put your stuff out there with a sense of humour about it and don’t put pressure of “please work for me and become my livelihood” then it’s free to be appreciated for what it is.  &nbsp;  Am I preaching? I don’t want to seem like a know-it-all, because I know nothing. I’ve been working for the past two years, quietly defeated. But I know how the quarterlife crisis felt for me, and Iike I said Dave, I wish I could come over with pizza and  gin , but the tyrrany of distance is a buggersome hindrance, and so is my wheat intolerance, and maybe if we actually met we would hate each other, though I don’t think so…  &nbsp;  I hope this is a temporary dark spot for you. Cos you know I love your stuff. What would get me in the mood for blogging if not  urlLink Metal City ?

         The following are transcripts of actual messages on the SBS Dymcocks hotline today. For context, SBS sell their merchandise through Dymcocks, largely CDs of a very daggy variety, and I am the person they order from:   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    A&nbsp;pissed off, indignant woman out for revenge:    &nbsp;   "Guess what you girls? You just blew it. Um it was on TV tonight, and er you just blew it! Ya coulda got a score! But nup, forget it. I'll just go to the record shop and i'll buy it myself. Forget it. Bye."   &nbsp;   Click.   &nbsp;    I was waiting for "So There!"    &nbsp;    For this one, imagine a mentally challenged man with cotton wool in his mouth droning in slow monotone:    &nbsp;   "Hel-lo...I'd just like to check my order...it's with SBS, on CDs and stuff...can you call me back...I don't know my phone number cos its written on my arm but&nbsp;I washed my arm this afternoon, and&nbsp;I kind of washed my phone number so&nbsp;I have to get it later. When&nbsp;I find my phone number I'll call you back but if you could call me back before that, that would be really helpful. I'm after this CD, it's called 'Wes Cavington' (?), it's like a jazz CD...if you could really call me back that would be really nice, er,&nbsp;I don't know what else to say...I think I'll just hang up."   &nbsp;   Click.   &nbsp;    This man was half talking to the phone and half to someone in the background. Picture a drunken farmer. Jamie Cullum is a singer whose CD "Twentysomething" is currently being promoted by SBS.    &nbsp;   "Um, um, Jamie Cullum just sang, um yeah...yeah. Yeah. Jamie Cullum, aye boss? He just absolutely destroyed that song. No, he don't know it. No. What ya sayin ya know it for when ya speakin ta me? Come on bruv. Aye, brutha! Hey it was Jamie Cullum, who's Jamie Cullum? Is that er, Tom York's um bruva in law, or his, or his third cousin? Ha! Come on man, who's Jamie Cullum? Hey,&nbsp;I don't wanna orda ya CD. From  dye-mocks  (in background, "dimmicks"), come on bruv! It's what? Dimmicks. Hey, bruv, hey, Jamie Cullum man, he just spoils every song he tries to, ya know, um, remaster.

       Saw Cuzzy last night and true to our pattern it was good again. If my theory is correct, the next time we see each other something will go wrong. Last night we sat in my room and listened to the Ani di Franco tracks I had downloaded, argued good-naturedly about the spelling of "independence" (I was right - "independAnce" my arse, Cuzzy), and it got a little too nice for a while. We ended up kissing. I touched him softly all over his big white cheeks, his eyelids, his lips. We kissed more. Then we kissed more, and then some more, and some more. He freaked out. I laughed. Some private things happened that I won't mention here. They weren't sexual. Just personal.   &nbsp;   He left, still freaking out. I felt...fine. Something in me still wants to be with him because he won't let me fall in love with him. I want to fall in love with you Cuzzy. I want to take you places, and I can't read you to see if you hold back because you're scared, or just daft.   &nbsp;   Boys. That thing between their legs just makes life impossible.

         My first day at work all week, and it's Friday already. Woo Hoo - sort of. As much of a Woo and as big of a Hoo as a sore throat will allow. This morning when I checked the voice messages I was delighted to discover that someone had farted down the line, twice. Whaleboy and I giggled like a couple of excited children. Usually I despise farts but this was an exception. In context certain things are hilarious, like poo in a toilet isn't funny because it's normal, but poo on a plate of fairy bread at someone's birthday party - now that's funny. It was a squeaky fart, this one, with some laughter in the background. We're playing it again for Ronnie now. The office is in hysterics.   &nbsp;   It's Ronnie's last day. He's leaving for another job that pays more, understandably, because he's soon to be a daddy. Oh Ronnie, you are wonderful. I don't know what I'm going to do without him. Well, leave, eventually.   &nbsp;   Ronnie: "Gem, did you hear the one from the other day? About the guy who washed his arm?"   &nbsp;   I dissolved into a hoarse cackle speculating about what kind of message this man had left about washing his arm. "Aw hoi, I was watchin' SBS tha uvva noight, an I washed me arm an had a nap, an I wonnedd ta orda that tape..." Looking forward to listening to all the messages I missed by being sick all week.    		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink Yahoo! Mail  - 50x more storage than other providers!

      I am pleased to announce that I am officially feeling better.   Thanks to Joe I have been using peanut butter in my cooking of late. I never really thought about it until I tasted his fat juicy chunks of satay chilli tofu. I usually try to avoid satay even though it's really yummy, but sometimes a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. Tonight's yums consisted of satay tofu, green beans and bean sprouts on buckwheat noodles with sesame seeds.   The bad news is I just sliced my finger open on the foil lid of a hommous container. The good news is that means I get to wear one of my Wiggles band-aids. It's enough to make one burst into repetitive catchy song:   Hot Potato hot potato,   hot potato hot potato,   hot potato hot potato (potato)   potato (potato)   potato, potato, potato.    &nbsp;  Mashed banana mashed banana...   Ah, Wiggles. N-Sync for three year olds. I just did that thing with 'potato' where you type a word over and over and it begins to look foreign and unfamiliar and you keep squinting at it, wondering if you're typing it wrong.  The Head of the Faculty (that's me) has decided that We (that's Myself, I, and Me) are going to work tomorrow because we think we have recovered almost in full. We still sound like we have a bouquet of thorny brambles stuck in our throat, but it's better than sounding like we are gargling gravel.

       Right Job, Wrong Job Find the Perfect Job for You     Gem, the Right Job for you will allow you to be:   Analytical and Creative   urlLink   As an Analytical type, you don't want to be limited by established rules and regulations. Your inquisitive nature demands that you sometimes question authority. Otherwise, you might not be able to find fresh approaches, or come up with new solutions to a problem. It's not that you act without weighing the pros and cons of a situation — it's more that you're more willing than others to take justifiable risks if they'll further your career success. You're smart enough to know when you need help and are confident enough in your abilities to ask for it. You understand that sometimes there are no clear right and wrong answers, and that's just fine with you because you tolerate gray areas better than most. In fact, pondering potential outcomes can sometimes be more interesting than coming up with the definitive solution for you. Your right job doesn't have to be about self-expression, but it needs to be a job you can be proud of.

      Could it be chronic fatigue? What does such a thing feel like? I mean, the term is self-explanatory, but how fatigued must one feel in order to be diagnosed as chronic? And is it accompanied by a low-level, persistent flu, and a strange dizziness? Maybe it's psychosomatic. Is my brain making it impossible for my body to go to work so that I can stay home and write? Am I having some sort of breakdown?   I had something like a breakdown once. It was last year, when I told Gravy that Cuzzy and I were going to be together, and he was furious, and sliced me out of his life, just like Dad did a couple of years ago. I don't think I had&nbsp;really dealt with the Dad thing, in fact I still don't think I have, and it was just too much to have two people in my life do that to me, for reasons to do with their own emotional weakness rather than me having actually done anything wrong. Funny, I used to think of that saying that women have a tendency to be with men who are similar to their fathers, and I would scoff, because it seems to me that I choose gentle, artistic men - the antithesis of my angry 'man's man' Dad, but when Gravy chose the path of "pretend she no longer exists" in an uncanny imitation of Dad, I realized that they were inherently very similar. It was too much. Gravy brought to the fore everything I hadn't let myself feel towards my Dad, too busy being strong and moving on before it could affect me,&nbsp;and he compounded the unresolved issues by inserting himself into my already troubled&nbsp;equation,&nbsp;&nbsp;and I crumbled. I remember sitting in Enmore Park with my mum, crying and blabbering, and she bought me some groceries and some Thai food for dinner, and I knew she felt helpless and worried, and all I could say was "I'm just like him. I don't want to turn into him."   "You're nothing like your father," she answered.  Which is true. I can safely say that Daddy has taught me a lot about how  not  to be. Don't get me wrong, he is a good man at the core, just very damaged and misguided, having had a rough life and never maturing beyond a low level. I would estimate his emotional intelligence to be stuck on age fourteen. He would never hurt anyone physically. But he's weak enough to disown a daughter for verbally defending her mother against his irrational onslaught.   Sigh. I don't like to talk about darkness because it seems to immortalize it and confirm its existence. But today, like yesterday, I am a little bit sad, and the darkness needs to go somewhere before the light can come back. When I'm down I become very quiet and pensive and I tend to embrace solitude in order to mend myself. A line from a Bjork song just sprang to mind:    Although I definitely enjoy solitude,    I wouldn't mind perhaps spending a little time with you,    Sometime, sometime.     &nbsp;  Wow, I haven't listened to Bjork for ages.   Darkness. Despite the gloom and melancholy I actually embrace the odd bout of sorrow because it means I am human, it lets me value brightness a lot more than I could if I was perpetually happy, and it is the stuff that honesty is made of. I think if you're not afraid to be sad sometimes, &nbsp;it means you're ultimately happy, because the nature of depression is that you can't see the candle at the end of the anus and you become stuck in the idea that happiness is an impossible dream. I have a simple faith in happiness, and in the benevolence of the world at large, and in my own ability to mend myself, which I think makes the sporadic bleakness a little less bleak. I actually like to revisit the dark periods of my past to revise how important they felt at the time, and how insignificant they feel to me now. When Gravy and I broke up for good I filled a whole book in two weeks with the deluge of my misery which I read over sometimes, fascinated. In fact, here is some of it:&nbsp;   I am about to tear my eyes from my head, to grab great gory fistfuls of eye and rip my face to shreds, my hands plunging deep into the sockets, nails scraping the flesh at the back of the brain, pulling tendons and fleshy red pulsing squirbs of innard, screaming the agonised scream of self-inflicted pain and laughing all the way, panicked schizoid laughter, the wailing of the sorry and wounded and insane. I welcome the lunacy. Just give me some pain, some other kind of pain to drown out the worst worst worst pain...    Assumptions, assault, insomnia, oversleepingoversleepingoversleeping, never knew how long ten minutes could be, never knew I was disposable - crunchy plastic in the gutter, can't even converse in universe, isn't there a drug for this? Medicine? What do you cry when tears won't come?  Whoa.  But there is happiness in breakfast. This morning it was rice porridge with soy grits, sultanas and apricots, a mashed banana, sunflower seeds, cinnamon, and rice milk, with a sprinkling of dessicated coconut. Unto the bowl I said Yum.

      Today on Darlinghurst road another of Sydney's homeless people rearranged my heartstrings so that at least three of them came unplugged and attached themselves to him. This man is at least sixty, tall and skinny with a long grey beard, wears a tattered suit consisting of an ancient bottle-green blazer with too-short sleeves that make his wrists look stretched, and some faded grey trousers. He is usually holding a bottle in a brown paper bag and either muttering loudly or yelling. Today he staggered toward his usual chair, which is a bench randomly placed on the footpath just outside the church, sporting his usual ensemble, but his feet were adorned with a pair of brand new, bright white, lace-up sneakers. They looked as conspicuous as a tutu on a bull.   "Give me my feet! Give me my feet! Give me my feet! Give me my feet! Give me my feet!" He hollered his mantra all the way to his seat, whereupon he sat and unlaced his shoes as fast as his rheumatic fingers could manage, which was around the pace of a fairly opiated slug suffering erratic caffeine-induced convulsions. He discarded the shoes to the ground with great disgust. I stood watching him from across the road, enthralled. When I finally disentangled my attention from him I noticed that several people were watching me watching him, I guess because I had stopped in the middle of the road, lost in the spectacle. I had been imagining the scenario that had preceeded. Did someone with good intentions strap him down and tie his new shoes tightly to his feet? He clearly didn't like them.  I think he normally wears thongs.  Here's something interesting. I have discovered Ani di Franco. Those who know who I mean have probably loved her for years. For those who don't know, Ani is a superb acoustic folk artist who lays herself bare in her music as only an utterly honest person can, singing from her gut about the things that matter to her, and listening to them, I can't help but feel they matter to me too. Folk is not really my style at this point in my life which goes to show there is something special about this woman. She has taken over from the hip-hop and the bling-bling and the jiggy and inserted herself in my stereo on shuffle replay. Well, for a day so far. I only made the CD yesterday.  I like my art with lashings of honesty. I like stuff scraped from clogged aortas, the refuse of torn hearts, I like the mechanics of humanity to be reduced to nuts and bolts and laid bare like a building site. It's been a long time since I was touched by music. It's nice to be touched.  It's time to whinge. I am sick again. I have been sick for days. This morning I called Boss_Dre_Bro and said, "Andrew, I'm still sick. I feel awful. This isn't fair on you or anyone else in the office, and I can't control the way I keep getting sick. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the air-con. What I would like to do is significantly reduce my hours, but I know that will make things really hard for you, so I wanted to ask you, do you want me to just give notice and leave?"  "No! No, Gem, I want you to get better, that's the first thing I want you to focus on, and then I want you to come back full-time."  "I know, but I simply can't do it anymore. If there isn't an option other than staying five days, I'm just going to have to leave." I can't afford to leave, really, but I can't afford not to. It's a bugger of a catch-22. I was tested for glandular fever on Monday. As usual, the results showed that I am perfectly healthy, haemoglobinacally speaking.  Andrew told me there was no-one available to take over for me for any of the days I work. "If I moved your desk again, would that help? I could change desks with you, or you could swap with Adam?"  "I don't think it's the position of my desk. I think it's the whole office."  "Well if there was really a medical reason for you not being able to continue to work full time I would need a letter from a doctor, and I would have to recruit and train somebody new, which I think might be a bit unfeasable." His voice was soft and empathic, and almost pleading. He's a wonderful man, my boss. The best I've ever had.   "Okay. You know, the doctors I see are quite useless. They seem to be just employed machines whose job is to write scripts and usher me out of the office. They don't listen, they don't even pretend to listen, except for the one lady doctor who is hard to see because she's in high demand. That's why I don't go there unless I absolutely have to. And I go there because they bulk-bill." My voice was wretched with throat-gravel. I felt on the verge of tears, sitting in my bed, exhausted and dizzy.  "Leave it with me. I might be able to find a better doctor who bulk-bills. I just want you to get better first, and then we'll talk about it when you come back. Is someone taking care of you Gem?"  "Oh, it's okay. I'm not totally incapacitated. Everyone's at work but I'll be okay."  "Alright Gem, thanks for your call."  Moments later he called back with two phone numbers for doctors who bulk-bill. I appreciated it more than I could tell him with my croaking throat. Crawled back under my covers, burying myself all the way under like I used to when I was little until it got hot from my breath. And I cried.  Because what if it isn't the air-con? What if it's something bigger, worse? Part of me had hoped it  was  glandular fever, because then it would have a name, just like the relief I felt when I discovered I was pregnant because it explained why I was exhausted and emotional, even though it meant more doctors and money and pain and whatnot.   But now I have a letter from the doctor who says, "yeah, might be good for Gemma if she works less, aye." At least I'll know if the office is making me sick. The question is, then what? Do I avoid artificially maintained temperatures for the rest of my life? Why oh why was I born such a sensitive petal? In all other respects I'm quite a strong lady. Maybe it's a chronic, debilitating case of winter blues.  I'm melancholy tonight. I would even go as far as sad. Something feels wrong and I don't know its name, and when I don't have complete control over my environment I feel defeated and anxious. The urge to cry doesn't surface all that often for me. In fact it's almost exclusively instigated by issues with exes. But tonight my heart is heavy and my eyes sting, and I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's the moon. Maybe it's The Nothing.

      Yesterday was one of those days-on-pause where the weather seems stuck halfway between something and nothing. The sky was replete with concrete-grey clouds that pressed down toward me as I hung out my washing. No wind. No sun. No sound except the ones I was making with pegs and wet clothes, not even a bird. Still and thick and depressing. It felt as if everyone had deserted the planet for someplace better without telling me, taking the weather with them, watching me from their new home in space through super strong telescopulars, wondering when I would notice. I felt dismal. Grey matter clouded my mind like a reflection of the sky.  Then it rained. All over my washing. It’s bound to happen several hundred times in one’s life but it will never cease to bother me. Sometimes I think a retractable roof over the backyard would be a good idea: one that I could slide out when needed like a convertible car. Winter needs to eat some cake and rain needs to get laid. And so do I. Actually, I don’t.  I’m not one of those people who will jump into bed with someone easily. The first time I broke up with Gravy I decided to embrace my inner slut. I was distraught, trying all sorts of things to take my mind off him, to get over him, to stop trying to fix things because I knew we needed to be apart. I called a boy I vaguely liked, enough to think “you’ll do,” and he came over immediately, and tried his best to have sex with me, and failed, and in the morning I pretended to be asleep when he woke up even though I could feel him waiting for me to wake up too. He left and then I never returned his calls. I never knew 'sex' could be so bad.  Then a few days later I called another guy. The only condoms I had were bright pink and when he slipped it on, he remarked “It looks like a frankfurt!” I wasn’t very turned on to begin with, and that comment put me off considerably, but not enough to stop completely, so we had sex and it was average.  Afterwards he suggested we get a coffee. “Oh, I’ve never had a coffee,” I replied. This is true. I have never had a cup of coffee. I intend to try it when I’m thirty.   “Well we could get a hot chocolate?”  “Oh, is that the time? I really have to run. I have to get a train.”  “Well I’m going to St Peters, I’ll come with you.”  “Oh, it’s a different line. I have to go to Newtown.”  Apart from  Hi how ya doin , we never really spoke again.  Then I called another. We had hung out a few times and been friends for a couple of years. Nothing too close – we used to firetwirl together a lot and that was it, really. We slept together for a little while, until the day he yelled at me on my mobile while I was in the change rooms in a clothing store for not paying him enough attention. “You’re not my boyfriend,” I reminded him. The sex was good, but there was nothing between us.  Then the other one. He fucked like a porn star. Had there been a mirror in front of us (which could have been arranged) he would have flexed an arm and kissed his own bicep. At one point he slapped me on the arse. That was when I decided that casual sex just had nothing going for it.  I like relationship sex. I like the familiarity and the trust. Without knowing the other person I might as well just snip off my snatch and unscrew my boobs and hand them over while he plays, me sitting patiently in the corner sipping wine and glancing at the clock. My slut phase was a few years ago and lasted only six months, after which Gravy and I, after much trauma and accidental sex and fucking the wrong people, reunited in one of the most delirious, ecstatic periods of my life. Since then I have preferred to be alone, missing sex, than falling into bed with relative strangers and penises I’ve never met and mouths that bite too harshly and hands that fumble. I don’t think I’ve ever had satisfying sex-for-sex’s sake.  This is why I have the kanji symbol for “virgin” tattooed on my wrist (that sounds so lame but it’s not that bad – it’s outlined in black and filled in purple): being a Virgo, I identify with purity and a certain innocence. My friends laugh in my face, but I know what I’m talking about. I believe in monogamy, trust, fidelity. Those things seem to be relatively scarce, at least in my circle of numbats.  &nbsp;Uh-oh. I want some cake.

      It began in the pizza shop I passed last night, optimistically grabbing a menu on the way lest I suddenly become wheat tolerant. I perused the board menu before moving on. You can get a small pizza for $6.50.  So I went there later. It must have been around 6am. I asked for my usual pizza which is a Margherita with capsicum and onion - small please. The fat greasy pizza man who looked a lot like  urlLink Barth  from  urlLink You Can't Do That On Television &nbsp;picked up a single slice of forlorn wet pizza from the hotbar, which looked more like a bleeding triangle of cardboard, ripped it in half with his hand and tossed it into the microwave. I wanted to protest loudly but the anger was stuck somewhere in my wind pipe. All that came out was, "Did that pizza have any cheese on it?"   The fat pizza man nodded jovially. "Off cos." The oven pinged and he pulled it out. There was no onion or capsicum. If there was cheese it had sunk into the dough leaving a mere scraping of red sauce that looked like a fresh skin graze. "Six dollars-a fifty" he requested cheerfully.  "There's no onion or capsicum."  He frowned. "Noh! We usually-a not putta the topping onna the Marrrgherrritta. Is-a just-a chis."  "But I wanted onion and capsicum!" He was making me very angry.  "Oke." He nodded with an 'each to his own' expression on his face as if I had requested a medium topped&nbsp;with matchbox cars and marzipan and a cheese smoothie to go. He sprinkled slices of onion and capsicum onto my travesty, humming. Handed it to me like that. Furious, I gave him my money and stuffed half of the slice down my throat while waiting for my change. He returned with my $3.50, smiling good-naturedly, which I grabbed and then flung the remaining greasy pizza morsel onto the floor furiously, screamed I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN! and marched out. A fat man walked into the shop as I left and shot me a filthy look.  So then I happened to be staring at a photograph of a dead girl on a beach, as you do. She was pretty and blonde, clad in an acqua bikini, lying flat on her back with her eyes open, face contorted grotesquely like she had been terrified in her final moment. In the background her younger brother was running down the sand, oblivious to his sister's demise, and the freaky thing was - and this is the stuff that Urban Myths are made of - he was wearing her blue t-shirt and the notorious "acqua sarong," which by all accounts he had never actually worn in his life. Not only that, but a circular shape had been cut out around his arse, slicing off one of his cheeks, and had been replaced with someone else's arse cheek, clad in (gasp!)  acqua bikini bottoms . Myself and a couple of other people ooohed and aaahed at this photo as it was explained to us. An eerie feeling settled on us all. "Even to this day," announced The Explainer, "her death remains a mystery."  Yet it was normal when this dead girl manifested as a drunken poltergeist who lived in my loungeroom. She would enter each evening depressed, stumbling and suicidal, while me and three faceless flatmates sat on unfamiliar couches cutting things out of magazines. I hated her. She was a menace. I would be openly dismissive of her until she became impossible to ignore at which point I would utter icy comments at her, ignoring the disapproving looks from the flatmates who felt sorry enough for her to tolerate her. She had an unnerving habit of carrying a plastic vase full of knives of all description, from huge chopping knives to butter knives, which she would remove one at a time, touch the tip, and discover prophecies and hidden secrets that would make her hysterical. Her name was Joan.  "Look  Joan " I spat, "the mail has arrived  Joan , have you read your mail  Joan ? Apparently your baby is dead  Joan , you had a miscarriage, so you don't have to touch your knives and cry anymore okay  Joan ?" My bitterness was unmistakeable. I was surprising myself with my callousness. Joan looked guilty. She  had  read the letter that informed her of her miscarriage. She hadn't wanted to tell us because it would mean she would have to stop touching her knives and we wouldn't have to feel sorry for her anymore.  Wow, my very own poltergeist called Joan.  Those were dreams, by the way.

      When I was much younger I liked Indie, Garage, Grunge. I was&nbsp;walking home from the Judgement Bar tonight, past the  urlLink Hopetoun &nbsp;which has bands pretty much every night of the week, quite a popular Sydney live&nbsp;venue&nbsp;. Through the glass doors that have a clear view of the stage I could see a band playing, and I stopped to watch even though they were a generic three-piece ensemble wearing flared jeans and seventies-style big-collared shirts (undone), the likes of which I once embraced but have since moved on, ditto for the music. They strummed the final chord of the song and immediately launched into the next. I was suddenly accosted by disarming feelings of nostalgia.   What's that song? Who's this band? I looked at the chalkboard for enlightenment and it mentioned Big Heavy Stuff, something and the other whatsies, but nothing I liked / knew back when. I looked back to the stage. The frontman looked a damn sight like Tim Rogers. And he was singing  Purple Sneakers.     &nbsp;  It  was  Tim Rogers. By some bizarre coincidence, that skinny bearded drunk man spitting (or was that vomiting?) and convulsing and arm-dislocating on stage was&nbsp;one of my teen idols (well sort of: he was in an Indie band and that was enough for me),&nbsp; and the band was You Am I, and they were playing the song from  Hi Fi Way  that I used to like the most because the first line is "Had a scratch only you could itch, underneath the Glebe Point Bridge," a line that&nbsp;appealed to&nbsp;me because I grew up in Glebe, but which had never quite made sense ( But there  IS  no Glebe Point Bridge...Scratch? Itch?   Does that mean he took drugs under the Glebe Island Bridge?  ).  I stood watching them at the door. The security guard soon lost interest and walked away and I had a full view of the stage, probably much better and more pleasant than inside which was thick with body heat and packed to the back with punters who had managed to score a ticket before it was Sold Out, as the handwritten sign on the door announced. I knew it was hot and sweaty because&nbsp;when I realized there was nothing holding it closed, I opened the door and stepped inside, pushing a couple of sweaty boys aside, my face pushing through a wall of heat that felt like staring into a hair dryer on high.   I watched the crowd. They were the same people I had once bounced and head-banged next to in moshes of my past.&nbsp;Most of the boys had lank, shoulder-length hair. Lots of brown clothes. The faces of those at the front conveyed much more interest than their body language which halted at the point just before bopping became jumping - exuberant grins adorned their faces while they nodded with arms folded like an army of insane sycophants. One brave enthusiast began to hammer his head just in front of Tim, his long brown hair slapping at the hot air as if vigorously battering a dusty floor rug, meanwhile I waited for his head to snap off at the neck and go thudding to his feet.&nbsp;I nervously&nbsp;scuttled back out of the door, which I had been propping ajar with my shoulder, to resume watching from outside&nbsp;because Keenhead Airhair's neck-tourettes&nbsp;had begun to induce mild anxiety. A girl on the opposite side of the stage with wide, excited eyes was singing along so I carefully watched her mouth hoping to finally understand some of the lyrics I could never quite catch. When it came to the part I didn't know, she stumbled and mouthed something clumsily which didn't bare even a vague semblance of what it sounded like, shot an uneasy glance around her at the crowd,&nbsp;then picked up again at the chorus, and I immediately thought of football players 'singing' the national anthem before a game.  Purple Sneakers  ended. I turned to leave.   But they rolled into  Cathy's Clown . I am a sucker for songs I know the words to. No matter how bad it is or how long ago I liked it, if I hear a familiar song I simply  must  sing the words&nbsp; until the song is over, even if it is silently to myself. If I am conversing at such a moment I helplessly tune into the melody and adopt Listening Face while&nbsp;nodding in appropriate moments, trying hard not to let on that I am only half hearing the exchange.&nbsp; I had to stay for the rest of  Cathy's Clown . Tim sounded terrible and looked very drunk. His jeans sagged in the rear where his arse should have filled it. He yanked them up every now and then, unsteady on his feet, maintaining decorum enough to play the music, remember the words, and banter to the crowd, who hollered things like "Thankyou Tim, we love you Tim!"   I began to feel melancholy because  You Am I  would once pack out venues like the Hordern and the Metro, and here they were in a little pub in Surry Hills playing to a small hot room full of dedicated but reserved fans. Memories of the way I used to be at seventeen came flooding back. The green hair, the corduroy, the fearless moshing, the marijuana, the naive bliss. It made me uncomfortable. Seventeen is a skin I peeled off and left behind.   Don't get me wrong - I love the way I was when I was seventeen, I love the memories and I adore revisiting my past. What made me uneasy was that tonight the Hopetoun seemed locked in a time warp. It was as if the last ten years had never happened. Here was the same band playing the same music, here were the same people wearing the same clothes. Since then I have moved so far and been through so many different phases that the notion of  You Am I  having done the same thing for that period of time and having sort of gone backwards rather than forwards made me feel a little sick, a little worried. Indulging&nbsp;the doctrine of solipsism, I pitied the band and everyone in the pub, enjoying the fact that inside my mind I am free to do so.   I sound like a self-righteous snob tonight. Is it wrong to be disillusioned by such an insignificant thing?   I walked away to the tune of  Berlin's Chair . I couldn't take it anymore.   .....................................   So Tits and I hook up at the Judgement bar this evening. Her eyes are huge, like something you would expect to see magnified behind thick owlish glasses, lovely and bright blue, the sapphire enhanced wonderfully by her ivory skin and dyed black bob. Smokes like an industrial zone, does Tits. She must have gone through half a pack in a couple of hours.   "I'll tell you the short version of a long story," she says, not bothering to exhale the smoke but speaking it out so it forms part of her sentence, "because you always get the long version." She can't help herself and tells me the long version anyway. "...I mean, by this stage I was vomiting, and the doctor called and said look, you don't seem to be any better and you need to get to a hospital, so I went, and I sent Nick an SMS and told him to come and see me at St Vincent's. He never came."   "Hang on - you came back from New Zealand two days early because you were nearly comatose, he left you at the airport and got a taxi home, you called him the next day and asked him to take care of you and he didn't come, then you spent TWO DAYS&nbsp; in hospital and he didn't come and see you?"   "You know how when you're sick, you don't really think right? I felt really bad for asking him. I felt like I couldn't ask my friends either because, it was like, if my  boyfriend  won't help me then maybe I'm expecting too much."   "You should have called me. I would have come running," I tell her, feeling awful.   "I know. I realized that afterwards when I left the hospital and was hit by this  ferocious  fucking anger. The worst thing was, I thought he would come. I waited. My phone was broken and I was too sick to move. I waited and I cried. That's why I'm not speaking to him."   I thought,  that's deplorable. Thank fuck you have a solid head on your shoulders.     &nbsp;  "He told me he couldn't come because he was depressed. He was lying in bed, and every time he tried to move he cried."    He'll be crying with anguish at your grave next time,  I thought. Is depression an excuse for not coming to the aid of someone you love when they need your help?   Tits, call me next time.   I have an interesting yearning for fresh basil.

      It seems that Gempires turned 1000 overnight much faster than I anticipated. I was going to attempt some kind of countdown, or at least an epilogue of Malibu and Cola, but now that I'm up to 1004 hits the whole thing seems a little redundant. Oh well, I'm sure I'll have a glass of something or other in the near future, and I'll toast to myself and my little land of Cybriety.   Cheers!

       Oh my god. Last night the dream machine was verily working overtime and I was amused / entertained / accosted by a sensational dream featuring David, Vanessa, Nick and Tim. Dave, I met you in a pub opposite a pool table. It seemed to be some meeting of random people, perhaps a gathering of netnerds arranged for the specific purpose of finally copping a real-life glimpse of one another. I picked you straight away. You were very tall - looming at least a chest and head above me, and I'm not short. You must have been two meters tall. You had glasses but your hair was shaved and your face was round, in fact I think you had the head of my friend Jake, and you were looking around at everyone, trying to pick which one was me. I wondered if I should watch you for a while to see if you&nbsp;would know which one I was, because it might be fun to see which girls you would hesitate at, then when your gaze fell on me I realized my piercings would give it away so I waved to you. You walked  around the pool table to come and say hi, and you seemed really surprised when I jumped up and hugged you, then you apologised for something obscure - I think it was for the jumper you were wearing, and I told you not to be ridiculous. It was a dark brown jumper made from coarse wool, old and stretched down to your knees, and admittedly it was quite ugly, but I couldn't understand why you would say sorry about it. That was it. I am amazed at how relatively normal that dream was.   &nbsp;   But the normality didn't last long. At the next stage of the dream I walked into Nick's house where he and Vanessa were hanging out. Having met Vanessa before, my dream picture was mostly accurate - long dark hair, round face, only she was wearing white face makeup like a goth. Nick was unmistakeably Nick. How I know that is a mystery, and there was no clear picture at all, just a vague male figure with no face sitting on a bed with Vanessa that was situated right in front of the front door, but without a doubt it was Nicholas. He handed me a tiny zine folded concertina style which showed the history of his and Vanessa's relationship. I was amazed to discover that Nick had been Vanessa's boyfriend before Tim (sorry people, I have no control over what my dreams do!).   &nbsp;   "So, Nick came before Tim?" I asked Vanessa.   &nbsp;   "Yes," she laughed, and I realized that he would have had to, because Vanessa is still with Tim.   &nbsp;   "So, after Matt, there was Nick?" Now, I don't know if Vanessa's ex is actually called Matt, but if he is I would like to commend my subconscious on its weird but accurate memory, and he&nbsp;isn't I would like to know his name. Not that I ever met him but I'm sure Vanessa must have mentioned him in her zines.   &nbsp;   "No, it went Matt, then Elder (?), then Nick, then Tim," she replied.   &nbsp;   "So Nick, you and Tim are still friends?"   &nbsp;   "Well yeah, we only know each other through Vanessa."   &nbsp;   I flick through the zine that Nick had given me. It mostly spoke about Vanessa, and there were pictures of them, tiny little ones, looking very happy to be in each other's company, reclining on a bed in summer with their bare legs and arms showing. Tim arrived looking very happy. He was also faceless, but tall and thin the way I picture him, though I'm not sure why. Vanessa pulled out another "zine" that was more like a bulging scrapbook with all sorts of things crammed into it - enlarged photos of herself, little rag dolls that she had glued to the pages, lots and lots of writing and cut-outs and bits and pieces. I looked through it slowly, fascinated. Tits was there beside me suddenly, and she proclaimed that Vanessa's zine was narcissistic.   &nbsp;   "Of course it is," I replied. "That's why I like it."    &nbsp;   Nick's place had become a rocking party. Rene was there. I went to the bathroom at one point and realised that the little bag I was carrying had lots of money in it that I had forgotten about. I peeled off a section of white floor tiles near the base of the loo, fuck knows why, and it came off like a sanitary pad that had been stuck there, revealing a bare patch on the floor where I felt obliged to leave some money. I left a $20 note there and picked up a piece of toilet paper that I had scrunched into a tiny ball the size of a marble and accidentally dropped there, and flushed it. I realized I was very drunk.   &nbsp;   When I walked back where everybody was, we decided it was time to go to the pub, which was conveniently located next-door, and consisted of bunches of people sitting in a lane, each group enclosed by a square fenced off area, drinking long-necks.   &nbsp;   And that be it.   &nbsp;   My god, what goes on in my brain?

       Dig if you will, the picture:   &nbsp;   Gem, grey trakky dacks, stretchy black top, lotus position on Writing Chair. At the bit where the top ends and the trakkies begin there's a soft roll of belly poking out and she quite likes it. When she sings to herself she tends to smile because it's easier to sing in tune, and because it makes her feel happy. Early nights - remember those? It's been a while for her. It's only 8:30 and already she's going to wriggle under her sky-blue doona with a book -  Adam Ford's    Man Bites Dog ,  no less. She relishes the thought. S'been a while since there was groggy sleepiness although she's plenty tired plenty often, but  nice  tired, she says, is when eyes become heavy and the curtains want to come down  before  the show is over. Her belly is full. She washed the dishes and cleaned the kitchen as fast as she could because sometimes she just needs  stuff to be clean but in a sharehouse with a ginormous kitchen there are always messes and cleaning is surely the most boring thing to impinge on one's life but s'gotta be done, dunnit?   &nbsp;   You know what I really don't like (besides peanut butter wif oyal on top)? That thing mums do, and now I find myself doing it, where they wipe the bench down with a chux and sweep all the grit and crumbs into their palm. I have always found it revolting.    &nbsp;   "Boss, do you know the tap is broken?" Boss was rearranging a shelf of books.   &nbsp;   "Yeah, it's happened before. I'll get Jim to fix it." Gem filled a water bottle then paused for a moment in thought.   &nbsp;   "Fix-it men are always Jims. All Jims can fix things." Boss huffed a nose giggle. "and Jims mow lawns." Boss snorted again.   &nbsp;   "Jim's lawn-mowing service!" he laughed, pleased.   &nbsp;   "Can I talk to you outside for a second?"   &nbsp;   "Sure." He stopped what he was doing and we left the office to stand in the corridor. He looked at me questioningly.   &nbsp;   "Um, I've decided to resign. As of next Friday." He looked strangely surprised, as if he'd forgotten I was giving it some thought before making a decision this week. Maybe he thought I would think better of it and stay.   &nbsp;   "Oh. Are you positive about that?"   &nbsp;   "Yeah. I can't stay full-time."   &nbsp;   "What will you do?"   &nbsp;   "There's lots of work at my other job at the moment. I'll just do market research three days a week for the time being."   &nbsp;   "Would you be interested in coming back as a casual when it gets busy?"   &nbsp;   "Hmmm. That might be good. Give me a call."   &nbsp;   "Ok. Thanks Gem."   &nbsp;   "Thanks Andrew."   &nbsp;   I handed in my resignation today. It's official. Amazing, how quickly life can change. How little things can feel so fresh. Saying a final goodbye to the boy, deciding with finality to quit my job, and finding out I will be on the Emerging Writers Festival 2005&nbsp;advisory committee, all on the same day, felt like stepping into a brand new person.   &nbsp;   One thing I want to be able to do is put my feet behind my head like a yoga master.

      It seems that within the space of a few hours my life swung on its axis, maybe tilted a little to the left, and settled back into place much like a blind person falling into a deep hole onto their head and suddenly being blessed with vision. The narrative form is something we have come to embrace in our culture of literature and film: a beginning, middle and end make sense. We are satiated when loose ends are tied into bows and snakes swallow their own tails. Old chapters are closing and new ones opening here in Gem's Kingdom. The story of The Boy has reached its logical conclusion, the sojourn into Corporate purgatory has followed the Yellow Brick Road all the way to the Land of Was, the loose wires of creativity that have been flailing erratically in the motherboard of my mind like convulsing serpents have been plugged into the right sockets, and my legs are crossed in my karate pants here on my Writing Chair.  There is but one unsolved mystery. We need a flatmate. Hello? Bedroom for rent in fun Surry Hills household. Vanessa? Nick? Tim? H Jason? Anyone in Sydney know someone who needs a room???  Cuzzy. My biggest chapter has finally closed. The relief is a mother's tissue full of vaseline smeared on her baby's raw chafing bottom. (That brings back a somewhat disarming memory of when I was probably three years old of my mother lying my baby sister on the table and wiping her butt with vaseline, and I, remembering the comfort and sweet relief of the feeling, lay down beside her and spread my legs and requested that mother do the same for me. She complied and I felt happy.) My Two Times Good, One Time Bad theory re Cuzzy apparently does include phone calls because our last telephone encounter on Sunday, which was a little not-so-good, was followed by an evening of indescribable bliss and satisfaction last night.  "Do you know what I mean when I say this song is an aquarium?" I asked, sipping my Malibu while we listened to  One Mo' Gin  by D'Angelo. "It's all  bwol, bwol  like fat fish meandering through the deep sea. I mean, imagine  Fantasia  in an ocean scene where there are big round fish swimming through the water - this would be the soundtrack."  Cuzzy smiled and looked into the distance for a moment. I hoped it meant he was actually picturing the scene I was describing. "Yeah. I know what you mean."  "Blah blah Kubrick blah blah, something this that superficial nice nice?"  "Yeah, but I find with Kubrick blah blah and it's what? Soul and hip-hop and all that, but who's to say? I listened to it when I was in my dark period and blah this that other."  "I know exactly what you mean. It's the price you pay for being hyper-intelligent."  "I didn't know what supercilious meant. It just came into my mind."  At 10pm we realized we had been hanging out for four hours without actually having had the "chat" we needed to have, which was kind of alright by both of us, probably very much a relief for him - being a boy and all. And me? I had realized earlier in the day that I had already said the things I needed to say. I actually just wanted him to tell  me  stuff. But I wanted to break the pattern of me being the one to start things all the time. I was prepared to leave everything unsaid if it meant I didn't have to be the one to start talking. It makes me feel like a teacher or a parent.  Finally I said, "We aren't doing very well, are we?"  "No," he admitted. "But it's kind of good."  "Yeah. It's nice." It was. It takes Cuzzy  so long  to warm up but when he does the change is remarkable. Transformers, robots in disguise.  We sat facing each other, cross-legged on my bed. He curled up like a baby and closed his eyes, a smile on his face, and pulled me down beside him. I wrapped my legs around him and we hugged. He's the most comfortable man in the world, lovely big belly and chunky like sourdough. When we were sitting again he simply said, "And...Go!"  I giggled and took another sip of Malibu. "You know, I've said everything I needed to say." And then the unthinkable happened. He started to speak.  "I feel weird when I'm not sure where the boundaries are. I act like a cunt sometimes because I feel a sort of pressure, like you want something from me, like you want me to make you my priority all the time. Sometimes I don't know how to act. Some things I don't know and some things I do know and bofty bofty manlanguage blink beer sport."  "Wow. You're spot on, actually. That pressure you feel is probably real, because I  do  want you to treat me like I'm special, like I'm super-special, and it's hard to reconcile that instinct with the acceptance that I have no right to need that. I understand that sometimes it's weird after we have crossed the boundaries, but can you explain to me why that is? Feelings sharing woman vagina blah?"  "Because I don't know what you want, or what you're thinking. I think maybe I'm sending out the wrong signals to you."  "Cuzzy, that's why I like things to be  said . I like to know what's going on for you and I want you to know what's going on for me. I can't be your friend with the way things are, and I really really want to be, and that's why we're here. If I see you and I'm affectionate towards you it isn't because I'm misreading any signals, it's because I love you. We were always like that. I want it to be like that again."  He nodded. He was looking at me with an intensity that is rare for him. I had his full attention. I fiddled with the buttons on my crisp black corporate shirt. His hair stuck out at funny angles from being crushed beneath his cap.  "...And I wanted all of this to be  vocalised . I want you to know I am still enchanted by you, and mystified, and...curious. You know I wanted to take it further, Cuzzy, I wanted to explore whatever the fuck this thing is between us, cos it's this weird thing that is more than friendship but not quite something else. It was weird, when we were together."  "It  was  weird," he sighed. "Something happened, and then...it didn't anymore." The boyfriend / girlfriend thing kind of killed something and failed to replace it with something else. Except ebullient genitalia and naked adventures and overuse of the word "sure."  "But that can't happen if only one of us is willing to try."  "Yeah, and I'm not ready for that," he said. I hate that he isn't stupid enough to not know how he really feels. It's funny the way we clearly feel exactly the same way toward each other: a deep fondness and something midway between passion and lust, and to him that isn't enough to be worth pursuing, and to me it isn't enough to have ended with. I have faith in effort and optimism and dedication. He has faith in his gut instincts. It's the one thing I need to learn to do. Follow my heart. Cuz, I admire you for that, you bastard. I do.  It was about eleven when he rolled to the edge of the bed and slowly reached for his shoes. I always feel a pang at the point where the shoes re-enter the equation. I am quick to demand that they come off when he sits on the bed, and I try not to think about them there on the floor in the meantime, watching like gatekeepers with stopwatches and keys. The taking off and putting on of shoes is dense with semantics. It's the beginning when they come off and it's the end when they go back on. We hugged and kissed and kissed and hugged and kissed, and when he moved for his shoes again I grabbed him and pulled him back and we hugged some more, and took a long hard look at each other.  Against my wishes tears plopped down my face like grasshoppers. Something in his face changed and he pulled me close again. Lips, tongue. He kissed my tears away.  "What if you stayed..." I whispered.  "No."  "It would be so nice..."  "I'm not staying."  "It's our last night in the world..."  "I'm not walking out of your life, I'm just not staying. We can't keep doing this."  "You care too much about consequences. Just once, forget the world, forget the rules. Don't you see what this is? It's goodbye."  He closed his eyes against my insistence. It might have been with pain, or frustration, or nausea. You can never tell with Cuzzy. He shook his head. I smiled, cheeks and eyes wet, and held his hand. He looked at my face as I reclined on my bed.  "You're so beautiful." It's hard to know what to say when someone says that.  "Yeah," I said, in a  didn't you know?  kind of tone.  "Your eyes do look nice when they're wet."  "I told you!"  "You're such a narcissist."  "I know." We laughed. He sighed. He hesitated. He never hesitates. He was unsure. He's never unsure. He took his shoes back off. He never takes them back off. I gasped.  "What are you doing?!"  "Fuck knows." He crawled into my bed. My heart leaped.  "You just did the best thing you've ever done," I told him, crawling on top of him as he lay back on the pillow. He gently laughed. I stroked him for a while, pressed down against him letting the warmth of our bodies make me heavy and sleepy. Lamp off. We curled up together, lazily tracing with fingertips that scrawled  bye, bye, bye  into each other's skin.  I open the curtains for moonlight. We crawl into each other through the mouth. I lose myself in man. It's fluid and slow. One of us whispers  Oh god,  maybe we both do. We sleep in jigsaw formation. I get up in the morning and leave for work.  I fucking needed closure. Ah, happy ending. You have to say "The End" somewhere.

      Yippay, hurripee! I've been selected to be on the 2005 Emerging Writer's Festival program advisory committee, which not only means that I will be recommending wondrous beings whom what would be grouse ta be innit, but I'll get to meet billions and trillions of other writers and werdsmiths and creative types, and see it all come together in Melbourne in March 2005. Many thanks to  urlLink Adam Ford  for the info and the gentle push, and congratulations to  urlLink Dave of the notorious Metal City  for also being selected!  How fucking YAY is that? I am fibrillating with excitement.  In other outstanding news, in two Fridays time I shall be collecting my eroded soul from the Corporate Cage that has become the stain of my existence, scraping the remnants of my being from this desk of inanity, and exiting, stage left, to pursue an equally mundane but much more highly paid and flexible position at my other job in market research, where I intend to work but three days a week as a casual, giving myself a five day weekend every week [that made sense when I wrote it but as much as I would like to believe in an eight-day week it's unfortunately still only six. Thanks Nick] and the ability to choose when and if I work at all. Sick pay and holiday pay have ceased to be relevant. My priority is having time for doing the things I want to do. I feel like I have opened a window that I had thought was jammed shut but it was just a bit sticky from a cordial spill years ago and only needed a tiny bit of coaxing, and now I've nearly tumbled through to the other side which I had never noticed is made entirely of chocolate. Purple chocolate. Purple chocolate that sings like Ani di Franco and is really good in bed.  Speaking of good in bed...well, more on that later. Right now I have some celebrating to do. Don't you love it when everything is up? It's all white teeth and love songs. It's bubble baths and tongue kisses. Rolly puppies with huge feet and tamari almonds and that guy you have a crush on and new undies and clean sheets and pina coladas and lizards. I love a lizard. Glorious things.

       Yesterday I did less than the bare minimum of work. If Boss is not in the office I don't bother to answer the phone anymore, I let voicemail take the messages and call back later when Boss is back (sorry to all irate customers), meanwhile I email thousands of people and download lyrics and check funny links and throw things at Thirsty. For the past few weeks I have started my "lunch break" when Boss leaves to get his lunch at about 12:30, then when he returns at 1:30 I "start" to eat my lunch and finish at 2:30. I should go out and get some "fresh" air every now and then instead of spending all day in this fuckforsaken office but I am a helpless net junkie and Sydney's George Street is a nightmare at lunchtime anyhow because you're elbow to elbow with a plethora of Corporate Soldiers on private missions to find salad rolls and latte's to take back to their Corporate Bases.   &nbsp;   So here I am, on "lunch", which is like the entree to the actual lunch, which today shall be satay tofu and rice: a silly idea because that is also what I intend to have for dinner. Brace yourself Gem, Cuzzy is coming over tonight. I haven't yet established defining guidelines for my "Two times good, one time bad" theory so I'm not entirely sure whether our last phone call should count as the Bad, because is a phone call an encounter? I guess it is. Which would make us due for Good tonight, unless the world decides that phone calls do indeed count, in which case I will have to amend my theory that every third encounter with Cuzzy is yucky while the others are nice to "not including phone calls."    &nbsp;   God, am I a fucking masochist or what?    &nbsp;   Every time I write god with a capital G it makes me uneasy and sends me back to 1985 in grade 2 where a frigid misguided nun called Sister Patricia kept telling me I MUST write god with a capital G while standing behind me hammering my little back with her fist, just to make sure I got the idea. Later that evening, in the bath, I complained to my mum about my sore back.   &nbsp;   "Why is it sore?" she asked.   &nbsp;   "Because Sister Patricia banged me with her fist."   &nbsp;   "She WHAT?"   &nbsp;   "Nothing." I thought I would get in trouble again. After all, I had neglected to spell god with a capital G and therefore I had sinned, forgive me Father.   &nbsp;   Mum sat down on the side of the bath. "Show me." I turned my back to her. "Where does it hurt?" I pointed&nbsp;to just below my neck where that sinewy, haggard bride of christ had taken it upon herself to admonish me with her gristly old fist. "She punched you there?" I nodded, the tears starting to spill, because I was a naughty, bad child.    &nbsp;   Mum marched down to my school the next day and demanded to speak to Sister Patricia, who assured her that she had realized later it was the wrong thing to do and had gone straight to confession afterwards.   &nbsp;   Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce you to the moment when I disowned god, christianity, and all related idiocy. This woman embodies two of the most heinous atrocities featured in catholicism:    a) Everything done in the name of god is reasonable and good.   b) Unless it's bad, in which case you can be forgiven by blurting it out to the middleman in the big white dress who will tell you how many hail mary's you must say on your knees on a hard wooden bench before you will be considered fit for heaven again.   &nbsp;   Those confession boxes are shit scary for a little girl whose sins included "calling my sister a bum." Being in a dark box alone with a strange man is terrifying enough without trying to think of bad things you've done and reciting inane chants. It went like this:   &nbsp;    Oh my god,     I am very sorry that I have sinned against you,     because you are so good,     and with your help I will not sin again.     Amen.    &nbsp;   At age ten I refused to take a saint's name as part of my name for the holy confirmation ceremony. I have two middle names, and they are both Louise, because I simply chose my middle name again, much to the confusion of the priest, who took a second glance at the paper in front of him to confirm that yes, this young girl has chosen "Louise," and who the fuck is Saint Louise I don't remember there being a Louise in the bible, but there is a queue of nine year olds behind her whose foreheads must be smeared with this oil, the show must go on.   &nbsp;   Even at that young age I was disillusioned by the patriarchal nonsense in "my religion" - there was Him, and He, and Son and Father, and A-MEN, blah blah blah. I reasoned that a religion with little room for women had little room for me. Mum tried for a while to get us to come to church with her, but I would try to start Mexican Waves with my little brother and sister, and I would put my legs up on the seat in front, and I would sing the hymns in funny voices, and laugh at old men with hairy ears. Soon I just refused to go.   &nbsp;   But I don't regret my catholic education for a second. It opened my eyes more than anything else in this world and gave me a strong basis for arguing with missionaries and propagandists and other misguided types.   &nbsp;   I will, however, reluctantly continue to write god with a capital G if it appears at the beginning of a sentence, because I subscribe to the Holy Doctrine of Grammatical Correctness, and have much respect for said doctrine, but it still makes me slightly uneasy. In my mind, god should be spelling Gem with a capital G, and if she decides to do that I'll think about reciprocating the gesture.   		 Do you Yahoo!?  Express yourself with Y! Messenger!

       I had to bring my Ani di Franco CD to work this morning. I like it when you love a whole CD and your favourite song keeps changing, you put a song on repeat until you know it backwards and it feels like it's written under your skin, and then you realise that there's another song that you love just as much but never realised before, so you stick it on repeat and download the lyrics and do all the things that indicate that it's a kick-arse song, and I love it when the words are all salient and you feel like she's talking to you...Ani, that is. I'm in love with this woman.   &nbsp;    I am walking     out in the rain     and I am listening to the low moan      of the dial tone again     and I am getting     nowhere with you     and I can't let it go     and I can't get through    &nbsp;   I sang it all the way to work. I think I want to be her, or at least hang out with her in her loungeroom sitting cross-legged on her couch in my baggy karate pants and no shoes while she strums and hums and grins over at me when I suggest a lyric.   &nbsp;    Oh no, don't close your eyes     I am writing     graffiti on your body     I am drawing the story     of how hard we tried     how hard we tried    &nbsp;   Oh Ani. That's the height of erotica for me. I've always wanted to write words all over someone in black Indian ink with a tiny soft brush. To me that is sex, passion, art, inside-out, the ultimate expression of wonder and love and lust and fascination. Don't you feel that? She's drawing the story of how hard they tried on his naked body in black Indian ink with a soft brush and their sheets are deep red and she has little tight breasts that brush his belly as she writes, and he lies silent listening to her words, and they stare longlingly at one another and wonder why it can't always be like this...   &nbsp;    The sky was much clearer     and the moon was so beautiful     that the ocean held up a mirror.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink New and Improved Yahoo!

      "I like the way my eyes look when they're crying."  I had happened to glance at the mirror holding the phone to my ear. My tears glinted in the lamplight, wet and shiny, my cheeks pink from the warmth of the heater, hair in a ponytail.  "You are so shamelessly narcissistic."  "I know. I think I always have been. I'm just more vocal about it these days." I laughed in spite of the tepid heartache. Think of the crate under my bed where I store all my old diaries, pages and pages of my life in little books carefully preserved, decorated with drawings and scribblings and cuttings: my favourite reading material in the world is in those books. "Do you find yourself to be the most fascinating person in the world? I mean, do you think that all the things you like in the world, and all the things you do, and the way you choose to think about life, are the best?"  He paused, thinking. "Um, some of them. Not always. And I'd much rather read about other things than myself."  "Maybe I  am  more narcissistic than most. My favourite thing to learn about is the way people perceive me. Remember when you used to tell me things about me, and I would say, 'Really? I didn't think I was like that at all!' I like hearing what other people think, even if it's bad."  "Yeah. It's good, you know. It means you'll never be bored, or lonely."  "Oh, I would be lonely if there was no-one around. It's not like I only need myself. But you're right, I never get bored. There's always something to do."  How does anyone get bored? The world is so big, and full of things to play with. Some people get bored when there's no money to go out and spend. Sure it's fun to drink in a pub. But what about interviewing a random person on the street, out of the blue? Someone brand new. If you can get to the meaty part of people there is a lifetime of stuff there just waiting to be tapped into. Stories and wisdom and ignorance and catastrophes and love. What about drawing pictures and leaving them in people's letterboxes? What about sprawling on the couch with a friend in your slippers and making up different words to old songs?  Who are these people with time for boredom?  In spite of my narcissism Jake keeps telling me how wonderful I am and I don't think I can handle it anymore. It's flattering, but embarrassing. This morning as dawn approached and we smoked someone's cigarettes in the loungeroom Nick leaned in for a hug goodbye and put his lips up close to mine, and kept them there, waiting to see if I would kiss him I guess, but I didn't, and he left with Nath and Suchy and Bronwyn and Nash, blowing a kiss on his way out. Baz and I watched the Young Ones for a bit until he and Joe fell asleep and I realized I was the only one still awake, still laughing at the lunacy of Rick and Neill and Vyvian and Mike, so I went upstairs and settled into my laptop to write what I have discovered is a tragic but mildly amusing piece of nonsense.   I want to tell you everything.    We keep secrets, us humans. All wrapped in thick layers projecting white lies onto the big screen. From an early age I would scream if anyone saw me naked. I still keep myself covered, outside and in. Someone strip me off and just peel me open, I want to see what's in there. Will it be like a golf ball - a tangled mass of elastic bands? Will it be like a melon, all squishy and sweet? Will there be wires and knobs and plugs and bleeping instruments? Who's my doctor?  Soon I'll be living on carrots and faith. Yesterday the pizza made me feel bad for a little while, but not too long. Practicality is more important than fashion, I will never ever understand high heels, though why do I have my tongue pierced? In the great cat and dog debate I will always side with canines, such furry benevolent angels they are, sent to earth to be happy and obedient and loyal, unlike cats which are wild creatures at heart and not suited to domestication at all. I can't stand their disregard for the world, their aloofness, haughtiness, intelligence, disinterest. I am afraid of them. One clung to my head in a swimming pool when I was younger and pierced the skin on my forehead with its desperate claws. Someone had thrown it in and it was trying not to drown.  My first tattoo took three and a half hours. I emerged an altered beast. It felt like being inside a bubble, separate from the rest of the world. In the supermarket I hunted for Bepanthen to rub onto my tender seared skin feeling like an apparition, removed from my surroundings and my mind, having known nothing but the hot sting of the tattoo gun burning relentlessly into my back and seemingly into my brain. I  became  pain. There was nothing but pain: no thought, no relief, nothing to do but grit my teeth and visualize each stab as an insertion of strength and good energy. Soon it was such a part of me that I became conditioned to expect to feel it for eternity. When it was over I didn't know how to think for a short time because the pain had superceded everything and become my friend. I wondered if true, deep meditation was similar.  I haven't worn shoes with laces for what seems like an age.  I'm sleepy. The idea of going to bed seems terribly disappointing. My life is taking two steps forward, one step back, but it will get there in the end, it just might take a while. My mum read to me every night when I was little and for that I thank her.   I beg your pardon. You did so promise me a fucking rose garden.

      Ronnie has left the building. We had farewll drinks for him on Friday at Darling Harbour: Thirsty, R2, Whaleboy, Boss_Dre_Bro, Alex, Lucy, Jess, Neil and I. The "World Sports Bar" has odd plaster effigies of sporting men in action suspended from the ceiling: one mid slam-dunk at a basketball hoop, another swinging a cricket bat, and others immortalized in varying emasculating poses, which I found rather frightening. (Interlude: do you ever find that the cursor on the screen is obscuring your view so you try to move it but discover you're moving a bottle of water around on the table instead of the mouse?) But it was nice there. We sat outside on polished wooden chairs and nice tables, next to a pair of those tall stick heaters that are like skinny men wearing large metal hats with gas flames where their faces should be. Dre-Bro gets the slurs after one beer. It's very endearing.  When it's time to leave, Ronnie and I give each other a look of, "Oh no. It's over. This is it. It won't be the same anymore." I pull him close for a long embrace and he says "Don't make me cry!" I smile the helpless look of a mother whose child is fleeing the nest, and squeeze his hand.  "Oh, Ronnie." I laugh at myself being semi-emotional. Sweet guy. He smiles and looks at everyone once more. He and Thirsty and R2 and Alex leave and it's just me, Whaleboy and Jess. The conversation turns to astrology.  "I'm supposed to not get along with Virgos. Apparently Virgos and Geminis are bad for each other," laments Whaleboy.  "Adam, you're fucking married to a Virgo. She's having your baby. Don't believe everything you read. Actually, Gemini and Virgo are both governed by Mercury, which is the planet of communication, so it's common to see Virgos hook up with Geminis." He nods, unconvinced. I scarf myself and turn to leave but the way we had entered is now bordered by a low fence, guarded my a female staff member and a burly security guard. I can't seem to find my way out.  "Excuse me," I ask the woman, "How do I get out?"  "Through the front door love." She gestures vaguely. What front door? We had merely sidled up to a table and sat down.  "Where's the front door?" She turned slightly away from me to chat to the security guard who stood on the other side of the low fence, who was looking at me as they chatted. I waited patiently for a couple of seconds.  I waited impatiently for a couple more.  He's staring straight at me and pretending I'm not here.  They continued to banter. "EXCUSE ME?" Things like this really shave my eyeballs. "CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET OUT, PLEASE?"  The woman turned. "Sorry love, through the  front door.  The one you  came through. " She wasn't actually aggressive but she had a slight tone of  I said that already.   "I came through no such thing," I replied in my most polite voice. "But I shall find this elusive Front Door myself." If there is anything that infuriates me, it is being ignored or dismissed. I get a touch of the How-Dare-You's. Perhaps this is why Jonnie says I am haughty. I will not tolerate being disrespected by anyone, regardless of their status in society, or position on the hierarchical ladder. This sometimes manifests in what others have referred to as a 'problem with authority.' As soon as someone trys to squash me into a position of submission I will react and deal with any consequences later. And I will not treat others as anything but equals, which is why I wouldn't make a good boss or manager or leader. I prefer to quietly do my own thing within the realm of what pleases me and deviate from rules I find unsavoury when I feel like it. It's a big world that we live in, but I am only one person, and giving the metaphorical finger to the odd authority figure is not going to kill anyone.  So don't tell me what to do.  Saturday began with beers at the Rocks. Amee, Joe, Dollface, Rex, Baz and I. The more I hang with Baz the more I like him. He giggles easily. The trouble with starting at 3pm is that soon you realize that you have to eat food and there are six of you and you're kind of drunk and the notion of going somwhere for food that six drunk people will agree upon and leaving the comfortable table next to the heater where there is beer is as unappealing as it is unlikely. So the salty snacks start coming. Between the six of us, in two pubs, we had overpriced bhuja mix, plain chips, salt and vinegar chips, corn thins and hommous (thoughtfully provided by me), a salad, a pizza, a toblerone, a bowl of wedges and a bowl of chips. That's disgusting. By nine it was nearly time to go to the Lansdowne.  There was two more hours until Manny and Mike's party started. Free bhuja mix in tiny bowls kept arriving at the table via Baz and Rene. I think they're meant for the people playing the poker machines. I think it's one bowl per person. We were gorging them by the trayful. Spicy little buggers they are. Rene starts to fade and leaves despite my protests, Amee and Joe are outside having a screaming argument, Gonz and his beachball head bobs to ragga on the dance floor, Toobs returns a couple of my retro CDs (I was wondering where they had gone), Jake arrives and does scattered bouncy Jake-like things and I realize I'm completely out of money.  Cuzzy is there when I come back from the bathroom. I am disappointed to feel nothing. Elation? No. Trepidation? No. I have nothing to say to you? Yes. But I hug him nevertheless and stroke his meaty back under his shirt and wish he knew a thing or two about responsiveness. He gets up on stage with Al and they do some freestyling and it's great, sometimes Cuzzy loses his thread in a freestyle but he closed his eyes and the rhymes kept coming and I felt that flutter again and I wondered, do I love him for his art? I kept wishing he would inadvertently lapse into some lines about real shit, about me, or love, or women or bitterness or remorse or angry goats wearing dog collars or swollen breasts or things he wonders about but is too afraid to ask, or really anything that deviates from the usual party drivel where it's rhymes for rhymes sake and says nothing of him or his life or...  Who am I to say those things? Like I said, I like art that is honest and raw. You can fine-hone it all you want but if it doesn't hit me in the gut I'll nod my head for form's sake.  And then he was back at the table. I didn't feel like saying the usual nice supportive things to him, even though I admired his efforts. He says nothing to me about my art unless I probe him, and even then it's succinct and superficial and disinterested while people who I am much less close to have complimented my writing with flattering adoration, doing much to alleviate my terror that I suck. But I hugged him anyway, and held his hands, and mock-bowed in a gesture of humble praise, and whispered "that was unreal." He talked about the mistakes he had made in his rhymes, and I mimed a yawn. He talked about how some bits were really lame, and I mimed a wank. Just take the compliment already, my barrel-bellied friend. You look so much better unshaven but your face is all bald like a deli chicken. Your 'work' is more important to you than everything else because you have no sense of balance. You back off because you're scared and naive and proud. You make me want to slap you, hard, leaving violent red marks across your cheeks, and scream at you until my eyes pop out and dangle from stringy nerves from their sockets, and lock you in a dark room until you're forced to look inside yourself because there's simply nothing else to look at. I think I just worked myself up into a state of pseudo-bitterness in spite of my good mood this afternoon.   So Boss_Dre_Bro and I had another meeting about my request to work less hours as a part-time employee. "I don't want to lose you Gem, but I've asked around, and none of the part-timers or casuals are available to take over for you. What does that mean for you?"  "Well, I know I can't work full-time anymore. If my only options are staying five days or leaving altogether I think I'll have to resign. I would prefer to stay and reduce my hours but I understand your position, and I don't want you to rearrange the whole structure and employ someone new just to take over for one or two days, and I feel bad enough of what you've had to deal with with all my days off, but I just know it will keep happening unless something changes."  "What will you do though?"  "It will be really hard but I'll have to just work at my other job. The work isn't regular or guaranteed so that's scary, but Andrew, something isn't right with me, and I can't keep working full-time, and I don't feel well enough to start another job elsewhere yet, so I'm kind of stuck at the moment."  "I want you to look after yourself. Right now you have to prioritize your health, Gem. Is there someone you can talk to? Another doctor you can see? Alternative therapy?"  I begin to feel bad about about how concerned he is. Even worse than my concern for myself. I tried to talk to Cuzzy about my frequent illness the other night but he is never interested in hearing that shit, with the result that he doesn't know much about how sick I can get. "You're only as sick as you want to be," he had said. In my mind I replied, "You live in another world."  "I don't want you to feel responsible about this Andrew."  "I know, I'm just trying to suggest things that might help you." It was quite touching. Andrew has that wonderful capacity for empathy that typifies Scorpios, psychic sponges they are. While listening to my words he would stare at some point in front of his face uttering frequent "uh-huh's" with his eyes wide and slightly sad, as if I was explaining that my best friend had been diagnosed with cancer.  I decided to think about it for this week. It's likely that I will resign the following Friday to dive into a temporary life of financial uncertainty and monotonous phone work. Do me a favour, guys - if anyone asks you to do a telephone survey, say Yes. It could be me.

      (Continued from "Nathan's Birthday")  It's always kind of distressing when the dawn cracks the sky open and birds start twittering. We sat there in the stinky loungeroom, horrified that the night had come to an end. "Let's go to Newtown," they said.  "Let's not. We're already in a loungeroom. Why move just to go to another one?"  "Come on Gem, we need a change of scene."  "Nath, your loungeroom smells like dog and bongs."  "Let's get a taxi."  "Why pay to go to another loungeroom when there's a perfectly good one here? And a pub on the corner!"  Nick stood from the couch, as did all the others, and gave me one of those funny grins of his, the ones that remind me of a muppet - something in between a smile and a not-smile. "Gem, get in the taxi, and I'll pay for you to get a taxi home."  "You'll pay for me to get a taxi home? Why not stay here and have my company for free?"  But I found myself sitting in the cab, still wearing my slippers and karate pants, heading to Newtown. The memory blur kicks in somewhere between getting to Nathan's house, sitting on his couch between Nick and Nash covered with doona, fending off excited dogs, and saying I'll come up to the pub in ten minutes guys, see ya. All except Nick and I headed up to the Union. It must have been two hours later that I woke up in Nick's lap with his hand surreptitiously crawling up the back of my top. It vaguely occurred to me to wonder whether I wanted it there. Then I lost focus and thought about other things. I think I dozed some more, half aware of his gently stroking fingers, half dreaming about smoky skies and Metal Mickey (remember him? What a cool thing to dream about).  He moved a little. I lay still, unresponsive. I could feel him waiting for some kind of signal from me, something to either encourage or discourage him. I sat forward and slurped some water from my bottle then plonked my head back on the doona that covered his legs. His hand found my skin again and resumed his shy exploration. The thing itself was neither pleasing nor unpleasant but I was interested to see how far he would go. He leaned forward and gently kissed my ear - like an aunt would kiss her nephew's cheek - and I had to stop myself from giggling. Fingers still roaming. I kept my eyes closed but maintained all appearance of being mostly asleep. The thirst was getting to me though. I reached for more water.  I think he got up and said he had to leave. I smiled, eyes still closed, and said "ok." He stood and stretched, had a cigarette in silence. He walked back over to where I reclined on the couch and knelt in front of me, softly kissing my forehead because it was the only part of my face that wasn't obscured by doona. He tried kissing downward toward my nose but I moved my face back and said, "Bye Nick." He paused for a few moments later and then left. I caught a taxi back to Surry Hills.  I don't fuck my friends.

       I would like to take this opportunity to wish Nath, who doesn't read this blog or know of its existence, a happy 30th.   &nbsp;   (Continued from "Two Pages of Drunken Quotes")   &nbsp;   Saturday arvo. We found another pub. The Clock on Crown Street. You pay $4 for a beer but the velvety red pod arm-chairs make it worth it. Slightly drunk, we returned home. Met Amee. Got a taxi to Nath's birthday dinner on Reilly Street at a Mexican place called "Cafe Pacifico." Atmos plus. Empty tequila bottles lining the top shelf of the bar as if waiting to be shot and killed. Loud spanish music. Red lighting. Hot salsa and corn chips. Jugs of Margherita. Pricy cocktails. Mexican beer. Fajitas piled high with beans and roast vegies and jalapenos. Nath sucked down some flaming blue cocktail and his eyes bugged out. Wished I had done some laundry. Hate wearing second-rate clothes on a night out. Paid for food. Left restaurant. Headed nowhere, wondering what was next.   &nbsp;   Surry Hills is not far from Darlinghurst. On the way back to my place Jonnie dragged us into a dodgy pub. Then another one. Nath crumbled at the knees a couple of times. He&nbsp;tried to pick up some chick called Sarah. Elkie did some kind of barn dance. Xan rolled a cigarette. Nath sat and stared, oblivious to our laughter. His face looked like it had been drained of the human behind it. I gently slapped Suchy's cheek because his weird mouth reflex makes me laugh every time. We leave the pub and head up Oxford Street. Nath collapsed into a heap outside the Judgement Bar.   &nbsp;   I picked him up and we linked arms and headed to my house with Nick, Suchy and Nash. Cold night. The scarfless ones shivered and trembled while I smugly buried my neck deeper into my scarf. Discarded shopping trolley. I told Nath to climb in and I drove him all the way to my place, thankfully it's a downhill road. He sang and rambled and bleated and roared at people, intermittently declaring how wonderful it was to be driven home in a trolley. We trampled into my loungeroom and set up with the heater and some beer and popcorn. Nath asked what had happened to Jonnie.   &nbsp;   "He's at the Judgement Bar," I told him.   &nbsp;   "Well let's call him and tell him to come here."   &nbsp;   Nath tried calling Jon, who didn't answer.    &nbsp;   "Take a photo Gem, with me and Nash." He grabbed Nash and pulled her down on the couch and they grinned up at me through the flash of the camera. I turned off the light for some atmos. Someone lit a cigarette. Someone opened a long neck. I think it was me. I think I opened two. I think I drank them both. Loungeroom stank of cigarettes. Kitchen stank of burnt popcorn. I think I laughed a lot.   &nbsp;   "Whose Nair is that in the bathroom?" Nick asked.   &nbsp;   "It's mine," I replied.   &nbsp;   "I thought you waxed?"   &nbsp;   "I do. But I used to do the tricky bits with Nair."   &nbsp;   "I wax my doot. Actually I Nair my doot." This is something Nick is fond of talking about.   &nbsp;   "Where's Jonnie?" Nathan suddenly hollered, as if emerging from hibernation there on the couch.   &nbsp;   "He's at the Judgement Bar Nath."   &nbsp;   "Let's call him!"   &nbsp;   "You already did, remember?"   &nbsp;   "Did I? When?"   &nbsp;   "About five minutes ago." Nath dialed Jonnie's number and left a message.   &nbsp;   Suchy turned back to Nick. "Do you really Nair your arsehole?"   &nbsp;   "Yeah. And my balls."   &nbsp;   "Is that for your benefit or hers?" I was quite curious.   &nbsp;   "Both. It feels better on both sides." I have trouble picturing Nick and his big clunky frame contorting, spreading his nethers with abrasive hair dissolving cream, and waiting patiently for it to work. Which is probably a good thing.   &nbsp;   Suchy was equally fascinated. In a moment of inspiration he asked "Does 'Nair' stand for 'No Hair' ?" I spat beer through my nose, laughing.   &nbsp;   "No, you spastic! It comes from the name of the woman who invented it -  Adrinair ."   &nbsp;   "Ha! No, that's Nad's!"   &nbsp;   "Oh that's right - Nadia." I thought my Adrinair was better.   &nbsp;   Nath sits up on the couch. "Where's Jonnie?"   &nbsp;   "He's at the fucking Judgy Nath. Remember?"   &nbsp;   "He doesn't know we're here though. We should call him."   &nbsp;   "You've called him twice already. You left a message. He knows."   &nbsp;   "No I didn't, that was before, at the pub." We were becoming increasingly bemused by Nathan's goldfish memory.   &nbsp;   "No, you called him from here."   &nbsp;   "Did I? When?"   &nbsp;   "About ten minutes ago."   &nbsp;   "Oh my god, I fully don't remember that hey. Oh my god, how did I get here? What are we doing here? Let's go up to the Judgy!"   &nbsp;   "We came from the Judgy. I pushed you here in a trolley. You loved it. Then you threw up outside. Don't you remember?"   &nbsp;   Nathan's eyes widened like frisbees. "Are you making this up? Did I throw up?"   &nbsp;   As a chorus we all yelled "NO I REALLY DID SHE REALLY DID YOU WERE IN THE TROLLEY THEN YOU FELL OUT AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER UPSTAIRS WE WERE ON THE INTERNET AND YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING AND..."   &nbsp;   "Nath, you forget what you've said every ten minutes. You haven't had one longneck, you've had six. Then you got four more and made us all take them."   &nbsp;   "Are you serious? Let's have another one then."   &nbsp;   ... To be continued...

       I'm not sure which is worse - having a dream about your ex-boyfriend masturbating and spraying the juice of his labour all over the bed and you and your sister, or having another dream immediately afterward about said ex-boyfriend as Homer Simpson who is placated when a chocolate bar is procured for him from a vending machine. Actually, I  am  sure which is worse. What I'm  not  sure about is why on earth I feel the need to post this on my blog.   &nbsp;   There's an innocence and absence of responsibility when it comes to dreams, I've decided. Ex-boyfriend, jism, and sister are merely symbols for unrelated ideas that happened to manifest (rather unfortunately) in a perverted dream, but that doesn't mean I think about things like that, any more than I think about Cuzzy being Homer and wanting some chocolate. Most likely I'm worried that my sister is in some kind of sticky situation and that Cuzzy doesn't always behave in ways that I approve of; and that Cuzzy sometimes wants something sweet and I sometimes know how to give it to him. Or Homer. That's my interpretation.   &nbsp;   How Freudian.   &nbsp;   How are you today?   		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink Yahoo! Mail  - 50x more storage than other providers!

       It's quiet in the office today. I am hardly saying a word to anyone due to my overindulgences on the weekend and a subsequent grey area obscuring the part of my brain behind my eyes like a smoky cloud. My eyelids feel like iron curtains and my belly feels tight beneath my corporate shirt. I ate too much. I drank too much. I'd like to go to the gym for two hours to sweat out some of my misery but exhaustion renders it unlikely.   &nbsp;   I am not a qualified massage therapist and I make no claims to be one. Yet somehow Rene convinced me (it wasn't hard, the cash was a satisfactory incentive) that she could train me in a few minutes and I would be ready to work with her at Home Nightclub massaging face-munching ravers on ecstasy for seven solid hours. She showed me a few things at home on the loungeroom floor where we had thrown Joe for the purpose of demonstration, then she gave my back a nice pummelling, after which I attempted to massage her. I really sucked. Everything she had shown me and told me seemed impossibly difficult and it felt foreign and uncomfortable to press her back in the groove between her spine and back muscles. "Oh my god Rene, what am I about to do? I can't do this!"   &nbsp;   "Yes you can. You have to." I was filling in for Emma whose hand had been mauled by a dog. Emma is a qualified therapist. All I have in the way of experience is countless massages on Cuzzy which were much easier on his bare skin with oil, compared to Rene's setup where the clothes remain and a small towel is placed on the back of the belly-down clientele. Working on Rene's back with two hands while she said encouraging things made me instantly certain it was a bad idea. Plus I had been at work all day and was even more exhausted than usual. I had nothing even vaguely resembling a stimulant, not even caffeine.  How the fuck am I going to do this...    &nbsp;   The taxi arrived and took us to Home with Rene's gear: a gazebo, blankets, cushions, towels and a&nbsp;clock. It felt odd and somehow privileged to be inside Home before any patrons were admitted, nasty loud house beats filling the empty rooms; smoke machines and disco balls doing their thing for no one except me and Rene, and the bar staff. The music was undeniably tragic and didn't improve all night. Normally I will get up and dance even if the music is&nbsp;not so bad, but Home on Friday nights is a musical travesty, embracing the appalling uplifting build-up climax style generic house that only twentysomethings from the suburbs venturing into the city for a night of hammering bass and illicit euphoria would find appealing. "Lay down," I told Rene. "I want to practice on you."   &nbsp;   She layed on the big cushions face down and I gave her a massage Gem-style. "Was that better?" I asked her when I had finished.   &nbsp;   "Yeah! That was awesome!" I could tell she was relieved to know I could at least do something resembling a massage at least to a bluffable extent. I didn't attempt to copy what she had shown me earlier - it wasn't going to happen. A little bit of faith was reinstilled after Rene's genuine appreciation. Soon my first client was lying in front of me. I wondered if he would feel ripped off.   &nbsp;   I did ok. By the end of the night I had developed my own routine. People, I spoke so much bullshit on Friday night:    &nbsp;   "What's your area of expertise?" asked one keen guy.   &nbsp;   "Er, mostly Chinese massage, but I know a bit of remedial as well."   &nbsp;   "Were those all the pressure points you were getting down my spine? That felt awesome," said another.   &nbsp;   "Yes, you've got those points all the way down." I demonstrated on his back while he was standing, poking him at random places down his spine.   &nbsp;   "Where have you been all my life?" He was very satisfied.   &nbsp;   "Will you marry me?" Another happy customer.   &nbsp;   "I've got six crushed vertebrae in my spine and you've found the knots in all of them. I'm very impressed." This man was gushing.    &nbsp;   My second client wanted me to go for an hour. I slogged through, nearly dead by the end, after which he gave me a Chinese massage that was truly life-saving and the best massage I think I've ever had. I gave him a $10 discount.   &nbsp;   I came away with about $300 cash and a chronic case of exhaustion, along with aching shoulders, legs, arse and back from bending and kneeling and constantly changing sides. Friday night is a bad time to cop a wad of extra cash. By Sunday, half of it was gone...   &nbsp;    To Be Continued.    		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink New and Improved Yahoo!
