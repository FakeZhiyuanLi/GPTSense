      Two nights ago was the most wonderful night.  Hannah learned how to kiss, or at least was wanting us to give her kisses.  She cannot do the pucker and smack noise, but she puts her lips together and says, "mmmm", and then she waits for us to come in and plop one on her lips.  After that she just laughs hysterically. She gave me and Dan kisses back and forth for 15 minutes.  We tried to get it on camera, but she would only give me one and then wanted to play with the camera as always.  It really was so wonderful.  It is amazing all the new things she learns each and every day!

      Well I guess I won't be writing every single day as a mommy's life gets very busy. Today HJ was as cute as usual.  We recently bought her new pink shoes from Target and at many times during the day, she brings them up to me to put them on her.  She loves walking around in them and especially loves the fact that she can walk outside in them.  She is so adventurous and is growing up so quickly now.  Everyday she is sounding out more words to say, like oof-oof for a dog (woof-woof).  Apart from that, here is an unusual tidbit:  We were eating McDonald's french fries tonight with a bowl of ketchup.  The next thing I know Hannah is pitching her sock in the ketchup as though that were the exact place it belonged.  It was kind of funny, but I had to tell her that was not where we put the dirty socks :) I don't think she really got it, but oh well.  She is my little angel pie.

       My little girl is getting to be so big and grown-up.&nbsp; I am as proud as I could be of her.&nbsp; Right now she is sitting on the floor reading her Baby Einstein book so intently like she understands everything that is in it- even though she can not talk yet let alone read.&nbsp; It has all sorts of animals in it, which&nbsp;are her favorite things.&nbsp; She also is a spunky independent little girl.&nbsp; She loves looking through pictures, of which her favorite are the ones of herself.&nbsp; I have two large pictures, 8" x 10", of her on my dresser, and she always points to them when she wakes up from naps (she naps in our room) saying, "dat dat".&nbsp; That means "that".&nbsp; She pointed at the fish on our shower curtain today, and I told her those are fish. She said "ish-ish".&nbsp; Her favorite shows are Blue's Clues (the new ones with Joe), and the Wiggles.&nbsp; With the Wiggles she shakes her hips back and forth to the songs and with Blue's Clues she is just glued to the television.&nbsp; Mostly though aside from TV, she loves to just play with her toys.&nbsp; Her favorite is her green wagon for two.&nbsp; She is in and out of that all day long.&nbsp; She is in and out of every room all day long too.&nbsp; She loves her room and our room a lot.&nbsp; Those are her favorite two to explore.&nbsp; Well that is all for today.&nbsp; I thought I would just start out with some basics.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy!

      Well it has been quite awhile since my last blog.  Hannah and I have been sick- I think we had the whooping cough- but I guess it is pretty prevalent in the south because of the air quality and mold and all that.  Anyway we are finally over the hump and so much has happened, but the biggest thing is that Hannah went poo-poo on the potty the first time yesterday!!  I saw she was trying to go so I rushed her in there to go to the bathroom.  She didn't really like it that much.  She fussed and cried but ended up being happy when it was over!  Anyways, the potty training is going slowly as you can probably guess.  We may have to wait awhile.  Also we decided on a name for our new baby girl- Lily Ann Cook.  (Not sure on the spelling of lily yet.) Well feel free to email me if you want to anyone- I would be happy to hear from all of you!  I will write more later!

           Well I have a few different details about the precious little Hannah to share tonight.  Earlier today she was playing in her green wagon in the sun room.  I was watching tv in the living room.  The two rooms are completely connected just so nobody freaks out.  Anyway, the commercial with the chips ahoy chunky chocolate chips came on.  You know the one that says, "  I'm a monkey chips ahoy, I'm alright...", and then there is the singing clamation chocolate chip cookie and the monkeys on stage. Well Hannah heard it and perked right up. She got out of her wagon as quick as possible and ran in the the room just to see that commercial.  But by the time she got in there, it was on the tail end of the commercial. When it was over, she headed back to her wagon.  Well then I started singing the song off the commercial, because it is kind of one of those songs that just gets stuck in your head.  She turned right back around and ran in to see if it was on again.  I felt so bad, but it was so cute and funny.  I don't know what it is about that commercial, but she can hear it from  anywhere  and come running just to be able to see it.  It is the only commercial she does that with.       We also today were playing in her room. I was looking through all of our baby clothes, to get ready for the new baby girl coming along, and I found this little sleep sack that Hannah used to sleep in.  It is basically a sleeper with no feet and just a sack at the end so baby can't kick it off like a regular blanket.  I was putting it up to Hannah to size it up and see how big it was and I decided to put it on her.  Well it was a little tight, so I just unzipped it and left the top part on her arms and let the back go out like a cape.  She loved it!  She had that thing on for thirty minutes.  She was just walking around having a godd old time!  I tried to take it off of her once because I though she was getting tired of it, but when I did she started bawling.  So I quickly put it back on and she was off again!        Here is another one. This one is so funny.  One day a couple days ago, Hannah was walking around just giggling.  I conldn't really figure out what was going on until she came a little closer.  She kept lifting up her shirt, pointing at her belly button, and laughing!  It was so funny. Then she would do it all over again.  She has been doing this a couple of days now!  Well I think that is all for tonight!
