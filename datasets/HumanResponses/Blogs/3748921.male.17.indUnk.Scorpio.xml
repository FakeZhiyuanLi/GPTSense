      It's now 22:54 (10:54pm for you weird folk) and I can't remember any of the nice things about my day. I've been to work again and It was exactly like yesterday except I have 3 papercuts on my right hand, three cut's on my right wrist and one on my left forearm. They didn't really bother me till I ate some salt and vinegar crisps and realised I had them. Working for UPS isn't bad till the last hour of the shift where I start to ache, some of the stuff we have to move Is pretty nifty like:  Mobile phones: There lite and easy to move and you might have thought they were for communication but your wrong. Screw your txt's and phone calls you haven't used a phone properly till you've thrown It at someone's head or had one thrown at yours.  Widescreen TV's: Everyone seems to want one but they don't realise that they endanger my existence everything I move one. Theres only one me and I'm not registered for the species protection thing. Go buy a portable there smaller, easier to move and you can do the rockstar thing with ease.  Hewlett Packard stuff: Lotsa printers, scanners, etc easy to move and stuff.   Bus'  I finished work at 20:30 (8:30pm) I got to the bus station at 20:40 (work It out lazy) my bus was due for 21:11 (It's not hard) stupid bus didn't show till 22:00 (see). Bus' have a habit of being late but 49mins late Is slighty ridiculous and since my bus was late I got home to find everyone's had gone to bed so I can't have a bath or shower. I smell, I'm a dirty colour and I have cuts to clean. Oh and my pants are torn.   [now playing - X-Ray Spex - I Am A Cliché]

      I lied it's not that interesting.  Today I got up showered, went on IRC said hi and stuff with lots of !!! And  So today I've spoken to Jayce, Koma and Moges. I didn't really have any idea of what they might sound like mainly because I... I can't remeber how this sentence was supposed to end. But anyway they all sound nice and stuff and Koma doesn't really sound 8 more 10 or 11 (haha I'm mocking you but you have better english skills and stuff so I'll shut up). Jayce sounded like she's from the other side of the world and she doesn't say bro at all. (I  Moges didn't say much he was watching tennis.. well he wasn't watching the tennis but he was looking at the screen.  I'm still waiting to talk to Moonman and some other people.  That was the interesting or not part of my day.  After all the fun I had to go to work and play tetris with stuff for 3½ hours from 5 while 8:30pm. By 7:45 I was drained of all energy apart from my face and my face didn't really feel up to moving boxes either. Anyway I dragged and scraped myself to the bus station and went home only to realise I have a new filthier skin tone and that my backs all like "meh, go prop yourself up on something" so me and my spine will be having words.   Oh tommorow I'm having curry for breakfast.  and I'm not sure if it's a script or plugin for the now playing thing so i'm gonna type it  [now playing - Modest Mouse - The Good Times Are Killing Me (Live)]

      I can't think of anything to write about that's worth writing about which makes me like a lot of other people on the internet.  But I did just get a phone call to say I got my job at UPS I just need to take my bank details In on Monday when I start.  All I have to do Is move boxes for 3½ hours and go home which leaves me all day to get up late, bother IRC and generally do nothing.  (Please critique my entry!)

      Why do males have a fascination with lesbians?. Its two girls, which yes is pretty kinky, but they're gay, thats the point so why do you still find it attractive when you know full well they aren't gonna want you?, there not gonna be there going at it and think "Hm, after all these years I suddenly want cock" Two straight girls kissing is waay more kinky in my opinion.

         Right now here in the   Uk   its summer so its all warm and stuff so I had my windows open to cool me down.  Having my windows open lets moths in, big moths, the kind that when their wings flap it sounds like skimming your fingers through the pages of a book.     So this moth comes in, fly’s around the light then past my head, by the time I’ve grabbed a magazine to hit it with it’s gone.     The next day I do all the stuff I usually do and at some point gone downstairs for something, as I’ve come back into my room for no reason I decide to make my bed, what comes flying out? Yep, that huge moth.             The next night the moth pops up again, fly’s around the light past my head and disappears for a bit, then later pops up again, as I go to smash it; it fly’s into my camera case laying on the floor, so I shut the case and leave it. Hours later at  2am  while I’m trying to sleep in the stupid heat I hear the moth again.     Eventually I got annoyed and got a glass and envelope and caught it and just left it inside it all night.              Cockroaches        Yet another stupid creepy crawly thing. I was talking with someone about them the other day and they said that they had no purpose, they’re completely right, what do they do?              [Cockroach] we’ll just be over crawlin’ on stuff and being all creepy like.  [Cockroach] you want to sleep? Fuck off, we have scurrying around to be done.  [Cockroach] just me and the family wandering around all “scurry, scurry” and your all like “ew”.         One day if someone tells me there proper purpose I might not hate them so much but for now I’ll just carry on hating crawly stuff.     I changed my mind about the God bit, my lack of religious knowledge kinda spoilt my idea.  Its probably been done to death anyway     [now playing - Rufus Wainright - Hallelujah]

      Today at 3pm I went back up to HMV and WHSmiths to see about jobs.  HMV said they didn't need any staff right now and that I should just drop in my CV and they'd maybe get back to me. So they practically said no.  WHSmiths gave me information of where to send my CV and who to send it to. So I might get a job there.    After that I went and watched  urlLink Shrek 2 .  Bought my ticket at 3:40pm, went in at 3:55pm for the 4pm showing, waited for ages and evetually the film started at 4:50pm!, thats nearly an hour after I sat down.    The film wasn't that bad, but who goes to the cinema with their husband, their friend and 4 kids and then discuss' their sisters new sexually transmitted disease? I'm pretty sure the kids were in earshot too since I could hear it pretty clearly. The kids only looked 4 or 5 at the most.    I think I like kids films too much. I still like all the other films but kids films make me laugh and sad and stuff, pretty pathetic really.  Film music! film music makes me tingle for some reason, not sure why but it does.    This post was way more fun than earliers    Edit: Just got told my friend Crystals having a baby, don't know any details though.

      Heh, I just lied..  I just got told that if I don't have a job or something by the time I'm eighteen I'm gonna get thrown out.  How nice most people would get a party that they don't want to show up to and I get thrown out.  So I have to get my boring life sorted by November the 11th 2004 or I'm fucked .. I'm either fucked and out on the streets where I'll quite happily curl up and die or I'll end up at my dads where I'll just carry on being a lazy fuck, watching dvd's browsing the internet, IRCing etc..  So I suppose I should at least make it look like I care and look for a job or spend some time at college again.    At the moment I don't really care about much and I can't think of a time I really cared about something worth caring about.  My mum says that at 14 I was barely ever in the house whereas now I'm barely ever out. She's right, at 14 I was out being a little shite, drinking since I was 12, smoking stuff, constantly playing with fire, girls. My mum never liked my best friend who was a girl. ok she wasn't exactly a friend she was more but my mum doesn't know that.  (she doesn't know I've done drugs, I'd be disowned so fast I woudn't know what happend if she ever found out).  Nowadays I don't want to go out, people are just fuckwits ..well not everyone but I really don't want to bother to get to know anyone anymore to find out or not.  Now that I'm 17 going outs not the same, I've been to clubs, pubs, bars when I was younger and there not my thing.  I'm much happier just loitering about with friends or going to a gig/show/concert if I bother to go out.    Meh.    [now playing - NOFX - Whoops, I OD'd]

       Yep, Its true.  I do nothing interesting enough to write in a diary about so I write crap here instead.  I can't decide what boring crap I want to write about, Its between:        Talking about every single link down the side of this blog.     Saying how nice most worthians are.     Copy and pasting my entire playlist.     Ranting about how much I liked certain songs or album or bands/groups people have reccomended me.    I just realised listing all those options achieves nothing so I might just do them all and see how big I can make this post.  Yeah I'll do that!.

         Receiving gifts from people in foreign countries rocks that little bit more than gifts from anywhere else.     This morning the  urlLink Regurgitator – Jingles (Best Of)  CD turned up; It also came with a nifty sketch with a note on the back.  (How many of you can say you have a piece of Deadartist artwork with a personal note on the back?)            So Deadartist I     you loads, but I’m not even sure you read this crap.

      Today I went in the bath for 3 hours. 3 HOURS!.  It wasn't intentional, as always I did all the stuff you do in the bath and then I laid back and drifted off.  I had another weird dream, I can explain it and describe it and stuff but I'm sort of not going to ..well only a little bit.  It was weird it didn't make any sense whatsoever but everything looked real but still strange and me and the other person in the dream laughed so hard we cried.  It rocked.

         When I was in the bath on Monday afternoon I had a dream that I haven’t had before.      Lately I feel tired and achy and I know if I lay my head down I’ll fall asleep within ten to fifteen minutes.         The good thing about this is I get to have a few more dreams even if I don’t remember all of them.                    So I was laid in the bath like you do and like always I start drifting off, I have no problem with falling asleep in the bath, I don’t think I’ll drown or anything so I just happily shut my eyes and dream.  And eventually I had this weird dream that was scarily realistic, I’m pretty sure it wasn’t real and I know it wasn’t scary.  It was just me laid there like I was with eyes shut and like always in the bath I drift in and out of sleep.   This time I hear the voice of a friend so I open my eyes slightly to see who it is and I see a shadow on the shower curtain of someone (when I went in the bath no one was home and I knew I’d fall asleep so I put the shower curtain up so no one pervs) and I shut my eyes again and then try looking again but this time my eyes are really really heavy to the point I can’t open them and I just get the slightest glimpses of white light shining through.            All of this didn’t really bother me till I was making myself something to eat earlier and I started thinking about it, the thought of losing my sight scares the crap out of me, if I lost my sight or hearing or the power to move I’d be devastated just like anyone else.     I’ve had plenty of weird dreams over the years some I’ve talked about and some I haven’t.  The best one by far has to be the one where I’m falling to my death from a great height.            At one point I’m sure this dream was scary but now the actual falling is a great rush for some reason and hitting the floor fills me with a strangest happiness.  The only let down to this dream is that when I wake I wake with a bump from hitting the floor, it feels like I  fell from a few inches above my bed.          I’ve had plenty of other dreams but that’s one of the only fun and interesting ones and it’s probably the nearest I’ll get to flying in a dream.

         Yep, today at around  2:20pm  I went out.                 I walked up to WHSmiths and bought two books and a magazine to keep me occupied in the afternoons rather than being on IRC.    I bought  urlLink "Love all the people Letters, lyrics, routines" by Bill Hicks ,  urlLink "Dilbert and the way of the weasel" by Scott Adams  and  urlLink Mixmag .      I then walked across to the cinemas to go watch  urlLink “Around the world in 80 days”  Starring Steve Coogan, Jackie Chan, Cécile De France, Arnold Swarzmerthinger, Richard Branson and some other actor folk.    I didn’t have my phone with me so I didn’t know what time it was when I got there and ended up being there way early, the showing was at  4:45pm  and I got the round  3:30pm .     So I ended up sitting reading the foreword of the Bill Hicks book, the back cover    of the Dilbert book and looking at the kinky manumission pictures in Mixmag (Don’t worry it’s about dance music and clubs not porn).     Eventually I went and bought my ticket and went in, the film was great, I laughed at all the funny bits and all the funny bits that were put in for grown ups that make the kids think “yer wha’?” while the grown ups laugh and have a slight coughing fit.             Being alone in a room full of people is one of the weirdest feelings.        Even though I did laugh and enjoy it there’s still the bits where it’s not holding your attention and you drift off feeling all sad and lonely, but then you laugh again and it goes away for a bit.              If I could do today again all by myself I would but I’d do it tomorrow and I’d have gone and bought  ¾  pants.      Today was really warm and I’m not a big fan of warm or sunlight so now I have a pretty banging headache.  But apart from that today wasn’t so bad.     Today - *** out of    *****.

         Here's my no-fail, fool-proof, hack-proof Twelve-Step Program to  Overcoming Your IRC Addiction!           Step 1: Admitting you have a problem.  Do you spend countless hours  typing away at people whom you only know by what is shown on a monitor.   Admit it, you're addicted.      Step 2: Accept the fact that the IRC is not coming back.  It doesn't  take a hacker to know that "development" would have been finished days ago.      Step 3: Don't place blame.  All the pent up anger and hostility towards  whatever led to the downfall of the IRC is pointless, which brings us to  step 4.      Step 4: Develop outside interests.  Go on, shut off the computer and  release that hostility in a suitable atmosphere.. say a sport.      Step 5: Resist the urge to telnet to GDFN or GRFN or many other local  chat servers.. YOU DON'T NEED IT.        Step 6: Go to a public place, such as the mall, beach, etc.  See these  people?  These people are exactly like those you converse with on the  IRC.  Go up to somebody.  Start a converstaion.        Step 7: Refrain from using IRC-lingo in this conversation.  Don't say  "brb" as you leave.  Don't say "/topic It's beautiful out today!" to  change the subject.  AND MOST IMPORTANT.  When talking about yourself,  use "I", not your nick.      Step 8: That cord running into your modem on the back of the computer can  also be used to speak to people over a phone.  Plug it into one, dial a  number, and start talking.      Step 9: Take up a hobby, volunteer your time, or get a job.  But  rememeber, in these kinds of situations, typos are not permissable as  they are on IRC.  For example, a sign should read "NEW STUDENTS" and not  "NEW STEWDENTS"      Step 10: Go lay down in bed.  Close your eyes.  This is what you've been  missing when you are on the IRC in the wee hours of the morning.  It's  called sleep.  You'll soon find yourself craving sleep, but that's okay.   It's normal.      Step 11: School's about to start.  Instead of turning on the computer  when you get home, open your schoolbooks.  Without IRC you will actually  have time to study and do homework.. Your grades will rise, and Mom and  Dad will be OH SO PROUD!      Step 12: GET A LIFE, EH?

      Today I had to go to the hospital for 8:30am (ew early morning, whats worse is I got up at 6am) .  So I went, got there 10 minutes early and sat down with my stupid slip the doctor gave me.  I had to sit there with all these old people waiting to get a ticket to go In and get done.  I got ticket #95 and the queue started at #89 so I wasn't there for that long, but the best bit was actually sittinig In the room about to have my blood taken. It's great watching other peoples faces, there was one woman to my left, a muslim woman with all her dress etc on, she takes it off enough to get to her arm and she's barely sat down In the chair and she pulls a right face. It was so funny to look at that I started laughing under my breath and had to be asked to sit still. It Rocked.    Other than that hospitals are just ugh, I usually end up there atleast once a year for something stupid anyway, except for 2003 I'm pretty sure I never went In 2003.

         urlLink Description of Your First Name of :  James    		 		  Although the name James creates the urge to be reliable and responsible, we emphasize that it frustrates you through a scattered and emotional nature. This name, when combined with the last name, can frustrate happiness, contentment, and success, as well as cause health weaknesses in the liver, bloodstream, and through worry and mental tension.  As James, you have a natural interest in the welfare of your fellow man, and a desire to help and serve others in a humanitarian way. You are responsible and generous, although somewhat scattering and disorganized at times. Any jobs requiring systematic and conscientious effort, or involving any form of drudgery, dismay you. In your work, you would seek a position offering self-expression through contact with people, such as sales or teaching, or a position giving scope to your creative, artistic talents. You are good-natured and likeable, and people tend to confide in you and seek your advice in personal problems. Others sense your sincere interest and desire to help, and you can always be counted on to see the bright side of any problem.

      Today I rang to quit my job at around 17:00 (5pm). I was fed up of coming home aching and covered In muck and filth. All I do for the three and a half hours Is move boxes, moving boxes doesn't sound hard but they start coming along faster, the quicker they come the more they pile up, once they pile up they become three times as heavy to lift before stacking them.  So this afternoon I fell asleep with tears In my eyes. I'm not even sure why I was crying but I was, and after waking up I noticed I'd been crying and realising this made me cry some more. ..I think I've written this whole thing In the wrong order as I was crying before I quit my job and I cried a fair bit afterwards. If I try to start again I'm pretty sure I'll forget and It'll have been yet another waste of stupid time.  Admitting to your employer that your depressed over the phone Is one of the weirdest things I've ever had to do, I found It weirder that she didn't seem shocked or anything, she just told me to see my GP (doctor) again and tell my mother something she already knew.   Can you explain how you feel in words without feeling confused?   I know I can't, I've struggled with words since as long as I can remember. Through school my problem was that I could read better than most In my class but my spelling, handwriting and generally getting stuff from my head to the paper was a problem. Thinking about It I don't think they handled It very well, they used to make me try improve my handwriting to this very pretty style which I liked alot but I couldn't keep up with, so I'd sit for an hour or two every evening trying to make my handwriting more readable.  Through highschool my problem was the same trying to get stuff to paper except now I had to sit through english classes. At first I was In the top set for two years before they realised I couldn't cope and dropped me down to set three where I didn't seem to cope any better.  After highschool I left with poor GCSE results and me getting stuff to paper isn't so bad since now It's going into a computer, I still miss entire words out as my brain doesn't move the same speed as my fingers and I often spelll things wrong and end up correcting It.   New bit   This blogging things great, I'm writing stuff down and It makes me feel slightly better. Half the stuff I'm writing insn't even In order and probably doesn't make sense to anyone but me and I wouldn't be suprised If no one reads this, I can't balme them as all I'm doing Is rambling away to myself sort of like talking to myself but not feeling so stupid. Obviously there's stuff I can't write down as It's strictly for my head only (or a certain someone I trust). I could write It down but I'd rather keep It to myself and keep something just for me so I feel like I have something you don't, so really I'm hiding stuff from people I don't even know or people who aren't actually there.. and I'm rambling again.

      It's Tuesday!.. whoopy doo.  Since yesterday we've had the plumbers In our house re-piping everything so we can turn on the central heating radiator by radiator not one's on all's on stylee. Earlier they did my room so I had to move everything away from my radiator so they could get In. Apart from my bed everythings next to my radiator this includes: drum kit, 3 big boxes full of stuff, a fan and some huge thing that I can't remember the name of.  Oh! I got woke by cramp In my left leg at 8 am this morning! I think that's what this whole post was about, maybe I get distracted too easily.

      Well It's Sunday and I haven't slept yet, I woke at about 9am Saturday morning. Doing all the usually stuff IRC, DVD's, Music and so on.   Films.  So far since Saturday night I've watched  urlLink Lost In Translation ,  urlLink Stuck On You  and  urlLink Scary Movie 3 .   urlLink Lost In Translation  was good. I liked It a lot, nice plot and the ending was a bit random as I wasn't watching the clock. The stories simple. One actor away from his family in Hong Kong or Japan or somewhere like that (my memories amazing) filming for some whisky advertisement. The other characters just a girl who's not quite sure what she wants to do with herself and has tagged along with photographer boyfriend. They end up chatting, getting along and then they go off doing fun stuff.  I'll shut up now and move on to the next film just incase someone reads this and has It spoiled for them.    urlLink Stuck On You  was just as good but In It's own funnier way. I spent a lot of the film laughing and choking and also wondering how they looked so realistically attached to eachother. I suppose the plots like most other films, Someone's hard done by, they realize their dream, they go off and do It, something goes wrong along the way, they get past It and carry on, they realize the miss eachother like mad and can't really live without eachother, they get back together and go do there own thing again with added girl friends etc...    urlLink Scary Movie 3  was just well not interesting really. It didn't have the waylan brothers In It which sort of spoilt It compared to the other two previous films, plus the story wasn't really amazing In the first place and there was all these crappy celeb people that I don't really care about.   Music.   This weekend I've listend to  urlLink Bright Eyes - Fever & Mirrors  and the  urlLink Lost In Translation OST .  From what I heard of the Bright Eyes album I liked a lot, Sadly I kept drifting off while resting my head on my hand infront of the computer. I learnt my lesson when my head slid off of  my hand and smashed against the pepsi can below It.  The Lost In Translation OST I liked a lot (hm, repetition) It had a few of the tracks I liked while watching the film and was very relaxing all the way through. If I wasn't cheap I'd go buy them probably.  You journalist type folk out there better watch your jobs as you can see I'm way more talented and honest and stuff and.. and.. I need a funny reason.

         Whee! I thought I had nothing to say but now I’m hyper, it violently rocks my tiny mind.     I haven’t eaten since around  18:00  ( 6pm ) yesterday and it’s now  15:09  ( 3:09pm ), I’m laughing at stuff for no reason, giggling away, making funny noises and singing along to songs, and I have a grin like someone shoved a coat hanger in my mouth.             I’ve drank 3.5 litres of apple pop, I love apple pop.     I’m pretty sure I’m the most annoying person you’ll ever meet right now, I’m intolerable (big word! 10 points to me) I’m pretty sure I’m gonna go act immature down stairs or something all by myself, away from others. It’s better this way.             And Ava was right, I can’t sleep, and I can’t concentrate to daydream, I just fidget more than usual.

         Woo, my week for social type stuff and ideas.     The other day I got invited to a party, last night I got a call from my old next door neighbour wanting to know if I wanted to go drinking with him and today I realised I can afford to go to  urlLink Leeds festival     for the weekend.             My old next door neighbour I’ve known as long as I can remember, this is someone whose mother always watched over from the landing while we were out playing, and I can understand why she’d watch over him though. Over the years, being kids I can’t count on one hand how many times I’ve bust his nose. Though one time he did steal my Lego motorbike guy and lose it somewhere, bastard.     She also never allowed him to go anywhere involving crossing roads, had him and his brothers babysat till he was 15 (he’s probably barely 16 now).             Now he wants me to go drinking with him, I still remember the time we got him drunk, two cans of cider and he was shaking and laughing, obviously we didn’t stop there, what was the point in having him drinking with us if were not gonna make him vomit and say he’ll never drink again?.             Getting him home was fun; getting drunk people home’s always fun.             The first time I got really drunk at thirteen I can remember having a friend having to open my house door for me ‘cause the key just wouldn’t go in the lock.     Later that day I woke up, felt like death and had the biggest grin on my face, then drove for 45 minutes to my dads and suddenly didn’t feel so good.             My other friend looked pretty camp that night, and stopped drinking fosters after two pints and went on to tiny martinis with lemonade, every time he went to the toilet half his drink was gone, we just blamed it on the girl he like and he shrugged it off.             Heh, now I’m thinking “Kids are the meanest things”. It’s true.     I never got bullied or anything, but I can remember allsorts of things, like the time some kid at my table kicked me under the desk and said something nasty to me.     Yeah, he soon got a kick in the balls at play time. He was also the kid that actually smelt like he crapped himself.             Junior school was OK, but I spent a fair bit of time with the headmaster.     Mainly because I never shut up, and while I was talking I wasn’t working, and while I wasn’t working I was stopping others work. Thinking about now it was really unfair.

         More proof the worlds fucked up,  urlLink Sex attacker wins lottery .             “ A man serving life for attempted rape has won what is believed to be £7m on the National Lottery.”                   Isn’t that great? Think of what he can do with that.         I can think of plenty of none pleasant things he could do with it, I’m not gonna list them though.                   It’s just not very fair, think of all the useful things that could go towards.         Like charities and other good causes, ok, I can’t think of any other good causes, but it’s not like they don’t exist, I just can’t think of them.

         Writing, we all do it. Lately I’ve put more effort into making it look like I use the English language. Why I suddenly care I don’t know.     I have to admit though it is quite fun, sitting in silence writing stuff that either kept me awake or gave me ideas. Time sort of drifts off when your not gifted, minutes do the whole getting quicker thing and before long you’ve been sat for an hour.             Anyway it’s raining, so, yet again I’m not off old book and postcard shopping.             I did get invited to a friend’s birthday party though, I’m not sure if she’s going seventeen or eighteen, oh I know her so well.             I know how the night will go, it’ll just a house full of friends sitting around getting drunk, listening to emo, rock, punk, industrial, Goth metal etc and eventually someone will do something stupid, I’m pretty sure I’ll be involved in this stupidity, whether were playing drinking games or fighting ninja wheelie bins.     Either way I’ll have something interesting to say the next day.             It’s at her house so there will be surrounding houses with neighbours and stuff, I know she has a younger brother too so I’m pretty sure its not going to be an all nighter, shame really, I love all nighters.             Heh, yesterday another friend IM’d me over MSN to say he went and got his balls pierced, how nice is that? I love it when he tells me that crap, ‘cause I really wanted the thought of a pierced hairy brain right before I ate.     Sometimes I think there’s a chance he’s stupider than me, even though I know he’s not.             [now playing – Sigur Ros – (    ) #3]

         Old age pensioners, yep, I still dislike you.     Today I actually had plans to go out and go old book shopping and to buy a postcard in  Leeds , but no! You can’t go doing that, keep yourself occupied? Don’t be silly, that’s not for you.     I’m having to wait in for my Granddad so he can finish plastering the bathroom, OK, I wouldn’t call him an O.A.P but he’s old and I want to blame someone, it’s raining but I can’t blame the rain so granddad will do, sorry granddad.             But I did have a nifty/weird/strange dream, I woke up with a smile and I was all snug and warm, so I’m in sort of a good mood.    :)                [now playing – Alkaline Trio – Sadie (And the sound of great British rain.)]

         Right now its  06:25am  and I’m awake. I went to bed at around 01:30am and I can clearly remember looking at the time around 03:30am. I did fall asleep at some point only to have a weird dream and to wake up at  05:10am .             I really do feel sorry for anyone who’s living somewhere warmer than me right now, stupid heats one of things keeping me awake apart from the usual. Can’t stop thinking and that I can’t keep still. Right now I feel like crying, I don’t have a problem with not sleeping when it’s by choice, but right now I want to sleep and I can’t, my eyes sting and I have headache..

          (If your excitement doesn't have a holographic sticker on the front DO NOT accept it, It will most likely be a pirate bit of excitement and should be reported immediately. Pirate excitement funds terrorism. Terrorism = bad etc. This warning was brought to you by me, wasn't it lame?, your answer should be yes. Thank you.)     ^That made me giggle.    Erm, this is sort of complicated, I had everything I wanted to say sort of planned in my head, but as usual I’ve forgotten it so I have to start over.              The whole point of this post is to say that I went to the doctors to see him about my blood test results and if I’m depressed and what he’ll do about it.     The results say that everything in my blood is fine and after sitting for thirty-minutes    answering questions on how I feel daily, my routine, what triggers how I feel, and the feelings that are triggered he decided that I am depressed. He suggested that I take anti-depressants for 6 months and see him after 3 weeks to discuss how I feel. (He won't be there in 3 weeks so I have to see him in four)              At first I didn’t like the idea of anti-depressants as you always hear stories of people being moody after being taken off them so suddenly. This was the only thing that bothered me about the idea. The doctor bothered to explain that he has no plans to suddenly take me off them and that he plans to just make me gradually take less.             So now I have a box of Oxatin 20mg capsules sat next to me, I haven’t looked in the box yet and I don’t plan to till tomorrow morning.             Other things he suggested were to eat regularly and eat more, apparently twice a day if I feel like it isn’t enough. If I don’t feel hungry eating’s not really worth it sort of a waste of food that someone else could be eating.             So anyway I have to sort my life out. Apply for more jobs and maybe think of something to do with the money. Also maybe set up my drums again and actual play them since I haven't played in months.              Heh, the lyrics of the song of my lyrics made me giggle:               Serotonin's gone She gave up, drifted away Sara fled, thought process gone She left her answering machine on The greeting left spoken sincere Messages no one will ever hear               I’ll shut up now.

      All the silly little things that I spend way too long thinking about. Theres plenty of these per day, they're usually pretty funny if I bother to mention them outloud, maybe not funny as is in "haha, thats hiliarious, your a genius." more "haha, why do you bother to think they way you do?."  I'd write these little werid thoughts down if only I could remeber them.  As always I'd love to know how the human mind works.  A few weeks ago while in the car going to my dads my dad says "did you know someone died on this road earlier this week?" obviously I didn't know 'cause I'm not from Rotheram, so I ask how and my dad says "it was a man, and he got hit by a police car right outside the ambulance station" the first thing that came out of my mouth was "well they were nearly lucky" in my opinion thats pretty nasty and mean and whats worse I didn't care about what I just said and I still don't .  I've never had the best attitude towards life that was pretty mean and disrespectful to whoever died. If I bother to think I'm sure I can remeber them.  [now playing - NOFX - Drop The World]
