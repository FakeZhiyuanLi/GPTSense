      Today I have been creating a website. It is going well but it is very time consuming. My website is going to be on WAC football. I am going to give team stats and then put in my own comments about teams, coach's, and staff. It should be very enlightening for college football fans.

      Do any of you readers have crohn's disease? I have had it since I was 19 years old. I got it my second year of college and have been struggling an uphill battle with it ever since. My weight is constantly fluctuating up and down and when it's on the down end which is very common right now, I hurt all over and my body is very tired. Due to this condition it has taken me several years to get through school. I had to take time off for surgeries and drop classes due to the fact that I could not get out of bed. Lately I have been dealing with the pain better and able to attend my classes more regularly but I feel like some think that I am using this disease as a crutch. If I had the choice, sitting around the house in pain shitting my guts out would not be the way I would choose to spend my life... I am not looking for sympathy and I hardly ever discuss my disease, but I feel that people who don't understand it think I am faking or not putting forth all my effort. Well how would you be doing if you drop 20lbs lost a couple feet of your intestine and had to walk around in chronic pain everyday?

      Today a box of cherries from the mainland was brought to me by Fedex. Unfortunately I was not home to receive the package. I returned home to see the notice on the door at 6 o'clock in the evening. So I called the fedex 800 number and told the man that I needed to pick up my package. The man on the other end of the phone told me he would call the Fedex here in Honolulu and tell them I was coming to get my package. A minute later the man gets back on the phone and says that Honolulu Fedex is closing in 10 minutes. I told him the package had fruit that would go bad if it was not picked up today. So he called the Honolulu fedex back and the lady told him she didn't care and hung up on him. He got back on the phone with me and told me what had happened. So then I told him that it was urgent that I pick up the package and that I could be at fedex in 10 minutes. He said that he would try to get hold of the fedex supervisor and tell he/she to wait until I arrived. 2 minutes later he got back on the phone and said that the same lady (Janelle) answered the phone and would not let him speak to her supervisor.  I have used Fedex shipping companies in the past in other parts of the united states and none of them have been so rude and disrespectful has the one here in Honolulu. tomorrow when I go to receive my 15lbs of rotten cherries I think I might take them into Janelle's office and dump them over her desk and tell her thanks for nothing.... Honolulu Fedex is the worst shipping company in the United States.

      Today I was going to post an audio blog but the service is temporarily not working.  So I will write what I was going to say. Tonight I am going to prepare Kalua pig. I have to let it marinate over night, so I will be eating it tomorrow. I will have to let you all know how the pig turns out.  Pork is one of my favorite things to eat. Anyway I am going to post a picture of the pig I barbequed last summer.

      The day started off with me waking up late for class and totally missing an appointment. That's not the worst part, I also have a huge law exam tomorrow. I started studying here at home but sitting on the couch and trying to study is a deadly game to play with ones GPA. With out having a desk to sit at all of my books and notes were getting mixed together. To make matters worse I had a television with 70+ channels begging me to watch them. After a couple programs I decided it was time to get serious about my law exam. I packed my book bag and began my treck to the library. When I finally reached campus I grabbed a student paper to brush up on the current events happening on campus. After reading through the paper which was decent for a change I was ready to start my studies. I started for the front door of the library as I got closer I noticed a steady stream of student walked out and the lights in the library were out. What is going on I thought to myself is everything going bad for me today? I decided that it was not that. I think it is because I am the biggest procrastinator in Hawaii possibly in the world. Any way I got away from all the interruption including my cell phone and am almost done studying. Aside from right now I have not used the computer all day.

      Today on my walk to school I walked past a homeless lady. Normally I wouldn't pay much attention to a homeless person, although this time something just did not look right. She was sitting on a bench eating a donut and drinking a 40oz of beer. The lady must weighed about 250 pounds... How in the hell can a person that is homeless weigh 250 pounds? She obviously has not missed to many meals. If she would cut back on the ding-dongs and malt liquor she might not be homeless.. Our country must be a great place to live if the poorest members of our communities weigh more then an Indian elephant..
