      Today was a good day.  I have still not talked to the one guy i really care about but i figure that my love life can be put on hold cuz I have extremely good news.  Perla had her baby and named it Ryan.  What a cute name!!!  So we were happy for her.  And then today Cachet and I went down to campus and checked out some hotties it is all we ever seem to do.  Shop, gossip and check out hotties.  I am hoping to talk to Michael later tonight tho so I hope all of you wish me luck.  I need it cuz as stated, I am a  little anxious to see what Michael says.  I am sure it will have something to do with our age.  But Cachet says honesty and at times brutal honesty is best.  So this is for you sha.  I am going with your advice.  However u know I am scared.  I keep seeming to freeze up whenever I talk to him.  This sure seems a lot easier said than done.  :-/

      To make things a whole lot worse than they are in my life, I have boy troubles.  My mother is mad at me for being a Wicca, which is a completely different story, my family is acting extremely stupid and at the same time I deal with the constant problems of bois.  I will be forward in this journal I am gay.  And there is a guy I like a lot.  He is 36 and I am 16.  Yeah extremely large age difference I know but we have talked for several months and we have built a friendship that is stronger, more deep than that which I have with even my best friend Alison.  It is odd he seriously knows me betta than anyone else.  It is as if he can figure me out see past my fake smile and innocent face when no one else can.  Point is we have flirted a lot lately.  I mean a lot it is upsurd really.  And I have realized age is truly nothing but a number and I want to pursue this only problem is I am scared he doesn't.  Which would mean I could ruin or damage our friendship.  So I have had my friend Katie and Alison helping me out.  I have decided tho to talk to him.  If worse comes to worse I will just eat lots and lots of choclates have an extremely emotional time and have a Buffy marathon.  That always solves my problems.

      I have a problem.  It seems that this guy Michael is really a big bitch.  It is like he has his moments.  I just feel that ever since I told him how i feel about him i seem to get the bad end of the bargain.  :'(   I just guess that maybe I should just forget him but it is kinda hard cuz I feel bad.  Like I went to my friends house before he was going to supposidly pick me up.  I called him and he is like oh well i am going to wait for my drinking buddies to call me I want to go to the club tonight so then that got cancelled so then he blew me off last night.  However he kept saying this morning that I was blowing him off.  What the fuck???? That is bull shit considering that he is the one who did not even hang with Amanda Sha and myself.  Dumb ass.  Then I told him that was fine or w/e then I talked to him today or earlier today at 4 this morning.  And he was like we can go to the movies todya if you want.  he said around 3 would be good for me.  I was like sweet I would like that.  Well I got up at 12 and had my coffee and did my stretches and called him and he did not asnwer and he has not called me back so now i feel like a loser.  Like I was forgotten about.  Cuz he has not called me or imed me and he is now 43 minutes late so we could not make a movie we wanted to.  I am just so confused I don't know what to do I just want to cry.  God I swear I try and make people happy and it always blows up in my face.

      Ok a lot has happened.  I told Michael how I felt, which did not go as well as I hoped it would but is ok cuz he did say maybe later down the road.  So we are continuing to get to know each other and then who knows maybe one day we will be an item.   It turns out he is looking for Mr. Right and he is choosing carefully and I understand that.  So I am willing to wait.  Then there was problems with Amanda and myself problems invoving a extra ticket for a concert we are going to.  We over invited people so that was our first problem then she was telling me who i had to invite out of Michael and Katie, and altho Katie is the logical choice i am pissed cuz I wanted Michael to go.  So we had to decide who to invite my friend Katie or the guy I like Michael.  Well it turns out Michael has to work the night of the concert so he is not able to go anyways which to be truthful is the only reason that Katie is getting the extra ticket.  Cuz I luv Katie but I like Michael as well.  That solved the problem of having to decide who was going to go.  However the up side to it all is that now Michael and I are going to the movies tomorrow.  Yay go me.  And I am really happy.  So now I am really happy cuz I am going out, as friends tho :( , with the guy that I really really like.  Anyhow that is everything that is going on in my life.  I have to go tho cuz I do need to start an introduction for my English paper.
