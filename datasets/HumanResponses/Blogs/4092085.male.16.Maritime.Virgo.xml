      Wouldn't it be sad if from the time we were born we knew exactly where we would end up in life? I personally don't believe in fate, but it might just be because I don't want to think that I don't have control in the outcome and direction of my own personal life. I enjoy being able to think that if I wanted to, I could completely change everything, and nothing would be predetermined.  But at the same time I can't help but wonder if my life will end up the same way no matter what.

      Wow that is quite an idea to ponder.  It gave my liver a huge ego boost but then was immeadiatly shut down by my heart reminding it of the beating it will take during college.

      I mean, I *heart* marching band!  That reminds me of the cadaver book I read and it posed the thought of what if humanity still thought the spiritual center of the body was the liver.  It would be like "I *liver sign* marching band!".

      School starts in two days.  I just can't believe that.  It's like I've not even had a summer.  I'm excited because (1) I'm a junior and (2) I *liver sign* learning!  And Mrs. Bovender is simply awesome.  And as excited as I am I'm also not really looking forward to working myself to death.  But it's encouraging to think by the end of this year I'll know Calculus, and high-level chemistry, and be fluent in Latin, and know more about the history of the United States than I ever wanted to know, and be able to write an incredible essay in a short period of time....not to mention play a piano concerto. :)   Gah the PSAT is soon too.  I had this grand idea of me making like 2000 flashcards and learning all the words but I'm so tired right now.  I have to read my other book this weekend as well...which I haven't even started on.  Life is just too complicated sometimes...having to juggle schoolwork and music and social things.
