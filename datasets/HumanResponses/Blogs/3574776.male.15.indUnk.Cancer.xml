      My cousin, Audi (its his real name, named after the car), slept over my place. We woke up at 5-45am and did some skateboarding at a park nearby. We brought my digital camera along and took some crazy pictures. I'll post it up by tomorrow if i can get them in. My cousin and i were like singing and dancing to some music when i realized that i was late for my soccer training. I had some photoshooting session today with the whole team. Anyway, i took a quick shower and rushed to school by cab. I wasted yet another  $10 . I'm taking a short break today from my studying. Maybe i'll start studying before the sunsets. I don't know why i don't have the sense of urgency in me right now,  just for now . The groove will definitely be back later. My next test and also weakest subject chinese, is on monday.  Dani is such a wonderful person!

      Ok. You guys must be wondering what happened to the other two pictures which were here but not anymore. I removed them. I want you guys to leave comments or send me an e-mail. So, yeah... If you still wanna see them, tell me. I'll definitely show it to you. My english test is on tomorrow. I'm prepared but not to the extent. I'm praying and hoping that God will help me and i know he will. I have faith in God. Many people have seem to disappear. I'm losing contact with some of you guys who used to visit my blog. They won't read this but... I'm just expressing my thoughts. Wondering where they are. They don't come online anymore. I gotta prepare for school. And going to bed early. Good night.  Listen to "have a nice day" by sterephonics

      I came back from my religious class about 2 hours ago. I just did 70 crunches at one go. My neck and tummy hurts. But its worth the effort. My aunt has booked a chalet (some kinda resort to stay in) this evening and my family is invited. So, yeah. I'll definitely be going. But, as always, i gotta study. And i'll start cracking after i'm done with this post.  urlLink Arsenal FC  will play Manchester United later shortly after midnight my time in Singapore. Arsenal will play without many star players. Obviously, i want them to win. But, i don't think they will. With the crisis they're in right now, i don't think they'll lift the charity shield trophy. The club is in debt. And, many of the star players are reluctant to stay in the team. I won't be suprised if the Arsenal captain leaves the team before the new season starts. The club needs to get a really good and proffesional someone to manage their funds. Anyhow, my prediction for tonights match - Arsenal FC 1 Manchester United 3 Let's just hope they prove me wrong.

      I woke up at around half past six. Its almost 7am here. I took my first step out of bed hoping i could find some of my mates, you guys mostly, online. Even though the time difference is perfect for meeting, there's no one here. So, i guess i'll just have to update my blog since i don't wanna go back to sleep. Sam, the free-thinker i mentioned in the previous post might just come over to my place this morning. We had plans to watch a movie, but i doubt we will. He's just passing me some stuffs and maybe go for a little drink after. Then, its off to nothing but studying. I've to prepare for the upcoming tests i mentioned about countless times. I'm still sick. Its been a week. I've seen the doctor. The drugs he prescribed just doesn't work. I will visit the doctor again if the irratation does not subside by Sunday. I'm still wondering what happened to Ana. She made an appointment to me online a few days ago but did not turn up. There is a possibility that her messenger is down. Ana, if you're reading this, leave a comment or email me. I can't wait to get my hands on the new software i'm gonna get soon. Just saving up a little more cash and i can do almost everythng on my computer. I'm anxious about how my pictures from my digital camera will look when i load them in here. I've been snapping countless pictures of me, my mates and family. They all look fantastic. My body is itching. I think the bed bugs bit me. I've gotta take a shower. Peace Out.

      I invited two of my mates over to my place to fix some computer device to enhance the graphic performance. There were some complications and my friends were not able to fix it. I've had enough, and i've decided. Even if its gonna cost me $200, i'm gonna have to purchase it. I'm gonna buy the windows XP software by next week. That will mean that i will not be able to get my first MP3 player. But what the heck? I'm sick and tired of trying to solve imcompability problems created by my ancient computer software, windows NT that is. I'm gonna have to persuade my old man to dig his pocket and sponsor me a little dough just enough to solve my problem. I've been going through too much misery. My mates and i went down to the void deck to play a little soccer using my punctured LA Lakers basketball. We were just doing some basic passing and juggling. Even though i'm a soccer player, i don't own a soccer ball. I'm cash-strapped. The situation will be worse after i use the fast forward to solve my computer problems. I went to the mosque after. Sam had to wait outside while me and the other lad did a little prayer in the mosque. Sam's a free thinker. We had a little slurpee at a nearby 7-11 outlet after my praying session ended. And i headed home. Sounds boring but thats just the way it is here in Singapore. I was hoping you guys refer to my previous post again. I'm dead serious about sending letters. I'm a big fan of  urlLink postman pat . I'm gonna get him to deliver my letters.

      Ana will be online in one hour... I hope. I've been coughing non-stop for the past 5 days. I'm still having a cold. In must have been because of the adventure camp. My school is celebrating national day tomorrow. No lessons will be conducted. There will be some activties lined up for us though. I'm not excited. It's gonna be a very tiring day for me and my butt. I'm gonna have to stick my ass to the parquet floor for at least 2 to 3 hours. Today has been a very non-eventful day... as always. I had a math test, got back my physics and biology class test results. The common test (tests at the end of the 1st and 3rd terms) will begin next week after the short public holiday ends. I'm still not confident of passing my additional math test. But i have to. My tuition fees are a killer. I've got a bunch of postcards here with me. If any of you guys (my mates from overseas, you know who you are) could kindly send me your home address to my  urlLink email , you might just win a trip to singapore. Because national day is approaching, some government organization created this event which lasts till the end of august. No gimmicks i swear. Visit  urlLink uniquesingapore.   Kim , maybe you might consider giving me your home address?  Ana , i have yours and i will send it to you definitely.  Matt , you too.  Kayla  ,  its a pity your address is confidential.  Jordan ,   Amy   and  Kirsty , sending me your addresses would really make my day.  Mia , i haven't seen you in decades. Email me. I know the chances of winning the trip to Singapore is low, but you'll never know. So, yeah. I'll be expecting some comments. Thanks. Merci Bien~  *Modified* Ok, i read the term and conditons, my dad is working in the Singapore Postal Company and i'm an immediate family of his and it states that i can't take part. So, i'm not sure. I'll try to send it. But even if i can't send the postcard, i can always send you guys a letter... So, yeah... I still want your comments!

      I had my geography class test today. I think i did pretty well. I hope the teacher will be lenient enough to give me a distinction. School today was ok. We had yet another public caning session today. A skinhead from my school got caned for stealing some cash. I think it was $1 or something like that. Stupidity. My room is kinda stuffy. I haven't aired it for quite sometime. My air-condition is leaking and the handyman is not coming until next month. Damn its hot. I might study tonight, i might not. It all depends on my mood. But most probably i will. I guess i will have to force myself. Math will be the topic tonight. Nothing interesting is really happening here in Singapore. I'm getting kinda tired of the lifestyle here. It's definitely boring. Plus, the weather here is terrible. Everyday is a hot and humid day. I come home with oily skin and i hate it. Its just school and home. And maybe the mall during the weekends. The cycle just goes on and on till the school vacation starts. The school vacation starts only in late november... The sun is setting now and its shining directly onto my precious face. Just wondering if you guys really take my blog seriously. Sadly, I haven't had much visitors visiting my page recently.

      Was busy scribbling some notes in class early this morning when my teacher told me that the exams will begin next week.  What the fuck?  I haven't prepared myself well enough. I knew that the exams were around the corner, but i didnt expect it to be next week. It could have been 3 weeks later or something like that. Damn, i'm in hot gravy. Just came out from the shower. Here's some of the things i  want  to get bu        t can't afford... MP3 player, BMX, laptop, windows XP professional software (so that my camera will work) and a new cell phone. I think i've enough for an MP3 player but it might just be a waste of money. I'm stuck between getting an MP3 player and the software. Maybe the software, so that i'll be able to show you guys the pics left in my camera still rotting. Well, i still don't know yet. I might toss a coin to help me decide. I've been splurging money for the past two days... On... Taxi fares. The money meant for my meals in school has been used for my taxi fares. I cracked open my little coin box just to steal a few coins for my taxi habit. I've been feeling very tired recently. The bus ride to school is just too much for me. Its not just the bus. I've to walk to the bus stop approximately 200 metres away, wait about 5-10 minutes for the bus, 10-15 minutes bus ride, alight, wait 5-10 minutes again for another bus, 5-10 minutes bus ride again and 5 minutes walk to school. Oh yes... The trip alone is hell. That's not it! Let's not forget the hard time i'm having in school. Its National Day on the 9th of August. There'll be a four day holiday. I'll have to take advantage of it. I'm gonna squeeze all the time i have for studies... starting from now.

      I was about to go to bed but since i'll be very busy the next few days, i might as well blog now. I went grocery shopping with my family about two hours ago. We went to the mall after and mom bought me yet another pair of jeans... My lucky day. I've school tomorrow and the subjects are killers. I'm still feeling unwell and i get irritated very easily. Ana didnt come online but i met Amy. She's hyper talkative at times and i like that. Im too sleepy to think and write more. I guess i'll just stop here. Oh, and if guys have any ideas on where i can get cool designs or tools for my blog, do leave a comment. Thanks.

      I messed up my previous blog, again. I shall repeat what i've written on the previous one. I really think its time for a change. My blog needs a brand new look. It gets kinda boring after sometime. I'm gonna have to study today. I'm having a geography test tomorrow. And a major exam is around the corner. I need to pull up my socks and i've got to keep telling myself that. Tell me what you think about the new look.
