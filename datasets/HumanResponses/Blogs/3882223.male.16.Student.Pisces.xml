      Christ. This weekend kinda epitomised what my summer will be like. I don't think B wants to know me any longer, after no pickups and four calls... I don't think I'm on the top of peoples lists right now. When the others get on their school break, they're off to Poland which shall leave me here, back to square one. But, so I hope, when they return a real summer shall commence. [I can only keep my fingers crossed so much]. V gets back from work this evening, but I doubt I'll be seeing him if he gets back in the early hours. I guess next week will be spent in a coffee shop, drinking soft drinks and a cigarette in one hand - as per...  I don't know why I have such  great expectations of the Summer. I think it all stems from the Green days - when I was Mr. Popular. Well, so it seemed. Then that faded out and I was left with another lot of people...now im just hoping that doesn't fade out. I don't think it will.  But, there is a new prospect ahead of me, a'course. New school, new people, new faces, new opportunites blah x 3. Things are going to be new, and, perhaps my past will fade out, but there's something ahead afterwards. How mnelodramatic. Today, I shall do nothing. Its 2:25 pm and im in my duvet undressed at the pc. Dad's currently at the Tour de France in a smaller championship - we all pray he doesn't fall off a mountain. lol.   ...I had the sudden urge yesterday to watch willow. I must buy it.

      I don't entirely know why I've changed 'blogs'. I used to be at diaryland.com but decided to change, as things are starting afresh.   The summer's here. Gah. Lots of thoughts swirling in my head. Waiting for other friends to officially finish their colleges etc so that the summer can commence  big time . Well, almost, I hope.   After the summer I start life in performing arts school. I'll be studying Theatre and most likely English Literature. There is no way on earth I thought I'd be sat here a year ago, winning a place in Britain's only free performing arts school. Strange. This will probably become home to future posts in the summer, and when I start school.   Things are about to change.
