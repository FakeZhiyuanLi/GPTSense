      If I know it and I'm supposed to know it (it was willfully revealed to me), then it IS my business. I hate it when people say "It's none of your business" when they really mean "You don't have a right to have your own opinion. You must believe what I believe." My response to that: Go to Cuba, you fascists.  ﻿Si je le sais et j'ai un droit de le savoir (ce m'a été obstinément révélé), puis c'EST mes affaires. Je déteste ça quand on dit "C'est pas de tes affaires" quand on veut vraiment dire "Tu as pas de droit d'avoir ta propre opinion. Tu dois croire ce que je crois". Ma réponse pour ça : Allez en Cuba, vous fascistes.  Jimmy

      Yesterday, in his speech at the Democratic National Convention, John Kerry explained his views on religion's place in a president's life.  urlLink And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.  I would like to comment on this. If America is "not us and them," then why does he differentiate between people who "wear [their] faith on their sleeve" and people who just "welcome people of faith." If he really meant that, he wouldn't even mention the thing about wearing religion on one's sleeve; he'd just paraphrase something Bush said about religion, say he agrees, and explain how it applies to his life, like what he said about Abraham Lincoln. I actually agree with what he said about Lincoln but I doubt he meant it the way Lincoln intended it to mean. Kerry probably believes God is for politically-correctness and against the Biblical view of morality. Lincoln was probably more in favor of the Biblical view.  Jimmy

       urlLink Apparently, Erwin J. Petterson Jr. is just that kind of idiot.  I bet if he had been watching gay porn, there'd be no charges because it would be intolerant to try to prevent a gay man from expressing his sexuality while driving. After all, gays are not just gay some of the time; they are gay 24/7.  Jimmy

      With computer software, new isn't always better. Why waste money on the newest versions of software when the old versions will do everything you need them to do. I still use Wordperfect 8 (from 1997) for grammar-checking French and I just bought Virtual PC on eBay (haven't received it yet) for $ with the shipping. I'm sure I won't miss any of the features on the new version with would've cost me $109 plus S/H.  Also, pay software isn't always better. I use tons of freeware available for free on the net. Why pay $1000 for Adobe Photoshop when the  urlLink GIMP  is free. Not only does it share many of Photoshop's features (including things only added in later versions, such as the pen tool), it also works just like Photoshop.   urlLink OpenOffice.org  is a great office suite that reads and writes MS Office file formats.   urlLink Grisoft  provides an anti-virus program to home users free of charge.   urlLink RAD Game Tools  offers a free download to permit the conversion of Quicktime videos into other formats. You won't need to pay the $30 for Quicktime Pro.  There are  urlLink alternative Quicktime and Real Player codecs  available which allow you to read and convert Quicktime and Real media files. The Quicktime Alternative and Real Alternative codecs don't restrict you to proprietary software. You'll be able to play Quicktime and Real media files in your favorite media player. Note: Real Alternative's presence on your computer will prevent Real Player from launching at all. You may need to change the file extension to .avi for your favorite programs to play Real media files. I have no experience with Quicktime Alternative.   I use other free titles but those have been the solutions to many of my problems.  Jimmy

      Here's an excerpt:  urlLink Then, in a remarkably candid interview with the San Diego Union-Tribune, the entertainer said: "It's a real conflict for me when I go to a concert and find out somebody in the audience is a Republican or fundamental Christian. It can cloud my enjoyment."    urlLink What do you suppose might be the reaction if an entertainer would say, "It's a real conflict for me when I find out someone in the audience is Jewish. It can cloud my enjoyment"? Or what if some politician had once announced, "It's a real conflict for me when I find out that someone in the audience is homosexual. It can cloud my enjoyment"? Of course almost no entertainers or politicians would ever say anything as bigoted.  Unfortunately, many people are bigots just like her.  Jimmy

      Entitlement mentality is the mindset that one deserves/has a right to everything that one wants. A person with this mindset believes that the world revolves around herself/himself. For example, many people who download pirated music have entitlement mentality. They refuse to accept that people's (blue-collar workers) livlihood may depend on earning money from said music. They refuse to accept that people's careers may depend on it. They refuse to accept that the music is worth anything. If you even so much as criticize them, they get defensive and start to talk as if you're trying to take away their liberty. One common argument they use to defend themselves is that everyone does it, even the person who's criticizing them. I read somewhere that even at the hight of downloading, the figure of people who download pirated music was only 21%. (I'm really sorry but I don't have a source for this.) The point is that they're so self-centered that they can't fathom that anyone would behave differently from them. They also argue that the prices are exhorbitant. Even though I used to believe that one, I still didn't consider that justification. Now that I'm in the working world, I know that the price of music is cheap in comparison to things like food and rent. But these arguments mean nothing, not even to the downloaders themselves. They're just  a posteriori  arguments. It's not about the truth; it's about the mindset of entitlement.  Jimmy

      Like many other Christian people, I often gravitate towards children's TV shows when watching the tube. The reason is, of course, that TV shows targeted at adults tend to be full of sin (sex, cursing, moral idiocy). Yet, children's TV shows often present a worldview very similar to that of us conservative Christians. Morality is often portrayed as black & white in children's TV. For example, the SpongeBob  urlLink episode on cursing . (It's funny how the politically-correct crowd still pretned they believe in black & white morality when it comes to kids.) Sex is absent from the plots and there is no getting drunk on weekends. I could give countless other examples of this, especially if I didn't have limited time because of work. Of course, I do watch television programs targeted at adults, such as Charmed and South Park, and I watch R-rated and even NC-17 movies. But when it comes to children's movies, they can be just as bad as adult movies, full of cursing, sex, and drinking. I will admit that I see moral relativism and revealing dress creeping into children's TV shows.  The solution to this is classic TV and classic literature. I love reading Arthurian legends but I hardly read literature at all. I regret not using my free time to read more literature.  Jimmy

      Virtually anyone can be a Democrat. Just simply quit thinking and vote that way. But if you want to be a GOOD Democrat, there are some prerequisites.  Consider the list below to see how you rate.  1. You have to believe the AIDS virus is spread by a lack of federal funding.  2. You have to believe that the same teacher who can't teach 4th graders how to read is somehow qualified to teach those same kids about sex.  3. You have to believe that guns, in the hands of law-abiding Americans, are more of a threat than U.S. nuclear weapons technology, in the hands of Chinese communists.  4. You have to believe that there was no art before Federal funding.  5. You have to believe that global temperatures are less affected by cyclical, documented changes in the earth's climate, and more affected by yuppies driving SUVs.  6. You have to believe that gender roles are artificial but being homosexual is natural.  7. You have to be against capital punishment but support abortion on demand.  8. You have to believe that businesses create oppression and governments create prosperity.  9. You have to believe that hunters don't care about nature, but loony activists from Seattle do.  10. You have to believe that self-esteem is more important than actually doing something to earn it.  11. You have to believe the military, not corrupt politicians, start wars.  12. You have to believe the NRA is bad, because it supports certain parts of the Constitution, while the ACLU is good, because it supports certain parts of the Constitution.  13. You have to believe that taxes are too low, but ATM fees are too high.  14. You have to believe that Margaret Sanger and Gloria Steinem are more important to American history than Thomas Jefferson, General Robert E. Lee or Thomas Edison.  15. You have to believe that standardized tests are racist, but racial quotas and set-asides aren't.  16. You have to believe Hillary Clinton is really a lady.  17. You have to believe that the only reason socialism hasn't worked anywhere it's been tried, is because the right people haven't been in charge.  18. You have to believe Republicans telling the truth belong in jail, but a liar and sex offender belongs in the White House.  19. You have to believe that homosexual parades displaying drag, transvestites and bestiality should be constitutionally protected and manger scenes at Christmas should be illegal.  20. You have to believe that illegal Democratic party funding by the Chinese is somehow in the best interest of the United States.

Le jour de son rendez-vous arrive, et il se dit: "Cela fait trois semaines que je ne me suis pas lavé, je crois que je devrais prendre un petit bain..." Il se rend un peu plus tard à son rendez-vous. La soirée se passe bien, malgré le fait que depuis le début de cette soirée, sa nouvelle copine semble le regarder d'un drole d'air. La soirée s'achÈve, il la reconduit chez elle, se prépare à l'embrasser lorsqu'alors elle lui dit: "Je suis désolé, je ne peux vraiment plus sortir avec toi: tu sens beaucoup trop le savon!!!" Translation:  A Frenchman has a date with a girl for the first time. When the day comes, he says to himself, "It's been three weeks since I've washed up. I think I should take a little bath..." A little later, he arrives at his date. The evening goes very well, in spite of the fact that from the beginning of the evening, his new girlfriend kinda looks at him funny. The nght ends and he drives her home. When he gets ready to kiss her, she says, "I'm sorry. I can't really go out with you any more. You smell too much like soap."  Jimmy

       Several months ago, the Episcopal church (the American branch of the Anglican church) approved a ceremony for the blessing of same-sex unions. One of their stipulations is that the ceremony has to be different from a marriage ceremony (where same-sex marriage isn't legal) because it's not a marriage. Now this confuses me. If they want to bless the unions, why not call them marriages (to be seen only as such within the Episcopal church)? Or why not use very similar ceremonies? It's almost as if they're trying to go halfway between seeing homosexuality as sin and seeing homosexuality as virtuous. (I think an argument they use is that they want to accept gays as people.) But that doesn't make sense? I wonder if there are ceremonies in the works for blessing the unions of children and stepparents who are romantically-involved. Why not for brothers and sisters? Why not for grandparents and grandchildren? Why not for aunts/uncles and nieces/nephews? Why not for in laws? For extra-marrital affairs? For sacrificing children to pagan gods? For a person and an animal? Why discriminate against all these "families" in favor of homosexual "families"? Because certain people today are in love with homosexuals and think they're more important than anything else.   Jimmy

      Translation theology is a way for... I guess I'll call them "post-modernists"... to teach their theology. The people I'm calling "post-modernists" are the kind who do not believe with the Judeo-Christian philosophy presented in the Bible. Instead of just admitting that, they translate the Bible (mis-translate the Word) to reflect their opinions. The latest English example of this I know of is the  urlLink "Good as New"  translation. Here are some verses from the translation: Mark 1:4 "John, nicknamed 'The Dipper,' was 'The Voice.' He was in the desert, inviting people to be dipped, to show they were determined to change their ways and wanted to be forgiven."  Mark 1:10-11 "As he was climbing up the bank again, the sun shone through a gap in the clouds. At the same time a pigeon flew down and perched on him. Jesus took this as a sign that God's spirit was with him. A voice from overhead was heard saying, 'That's my boy! You're doing fine!'"  Matthew 23:25 "Take a running jump, Holy Joes, humbugs!"  Matthew 26:69-70 "Meanwhile Rocky was still sitting in the courtyard. A woman came up to him and said: 'Haven't I seen you with Jesus, the hero from Galilee?" Rocky shook his head and said: 'I don't know what the hell you're talking about!'"  1 Corinthians 7:1-2 "Some of you think the best way to cope with sex is for men and women to keep right away from each other. That is more likely to lead to sexual offences. My advice is for everyone to have a regular partner."  1 Corinthians 7:8-7 "If you know you have strong needs, get yourself a partner. Better than being frustrated." If you'd like to see other translations of these passages, you can find them at  urlLink http://bible.crosswalk.com/  and  urlLink http://www.gospelcom.net/ibs/ . I've demonstrated that I do know how to translate (although I admit that I don't know any Biblical languages). However, translation from French to English is not completely unlike translating from Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek into English. There's always the same quandery, "Should I keep this like how it looks in X language, should I make it look like something one would say in English, or should I do something in-between." French-speaking people often say "to have a right" when English-speaking people would use "to be able, can." For example, "Click here to have a right to see the new photo of..." (I think that may have to do with entitlement mentality, but that's another topic.) It looks strange to right that in English but it's normal in French.  The "Good as New" version of 1 Corinthians 7:1-2 is "Some of you think the best way to cope with sex is for men and women to keep right away from each other. That is more likely to lead to sexual offences. My advice is for everyone to have a regular partner."  The King James version is "Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."  The KJV's "wife" and "husband" become "regular partner" in the "Good as New." It's very easy to explain why this is a miss-translation. "Wife" and "husband" suggest a marriage ceremony. "Regular  urlLink partner " suggests a girlfriend/boyfriend where marriage hasn't necessary taken place. This ignores all the verses in the old testament that give  urlLink wife  and  urlLink husband  clear definitions.  Jimmy

      Pourquoi en France, dit-on : Aller aux toilettes, alors qu'en Belgique, on dit : Aller à la toilette ?  Parce qu'en France, il faut en faire plusieurs avant d'en trouver une propre.  Why do they say "Go to the toilets" in France when they just say "Go to the toilet" in Belgium?  Because in France, you gotta check out many toilets to find one that's clean.  Jim

      Here's a French-language (prolly Belgian) anti-French joke. The translation will follow.  Comment fait-on pour tuer un Français ? - On tire 10 cm au-dessus de sa tête, pour toucher son complexe de supériorité.  What do you do to kill a French person? - You shoot 10 cm (4 in.) above his head, to get to his ego.  Jimmy

      Charmed est une de mes séries télé préférées. Elle est très dr&ocirc;le et la mythologie est intéressante. J'avoue que c'est pas une série très morale mais il n'y a pas bcp de séries morales d'en choisir. Pendant les premières saisons, il y avait une leçon morale dans chaque épisode et j'ai adoré ça et oui, je sais bien que les soeurs étaient assez promiscue dans ces premières épisodes qu'aujourd'hui et que la sorcellerie n'est pas morale.   Charmed is one of my favorite TV shows. It'ss very funny and the mythology is interesting. I admit that it is not a very moral show but there aren't a lot of moral shows to choose from. During the first seasons, there was a moral lesson in each episode and I liked that and yes, I know that sisters were as promiscuous in the first episodes as today and that witchcraft isn't moral.

        What can I say about this movie? I fear that this movie will incite violence against Christians. Obviously, the views presented in the movie are only the views of the directors. They're the kind of people where you're only allowed to sit at their table if your views are the same as theirs. I fear what will happen when this movie reaches China, the Middle East, and Africa where crimes against Christians are an everyday thing. One of the stars, Mandy Moore, said ". . .the message of this film is not about mocking Christians. It isn’t anti-anything at all. It is about discovering who you are and what you believe in. It’s about tolerance, acceptance and diversity." I've heard Jenna Malone, also a star in the movie, repeat this line almost word-for-word, on TV shows such as the Dennis Miller show. Obviously, this is a line the directors gave them. I don't mean to suggest that women of their age can't think for themselves (although male and female celebreties of all ages seem to have trouble with original thought) but obviously these girls didn't write this whopper. It was fed to them by the directors. I don't need to watch this movie to know it's one big straw-man argument against Christians. I have seen countless similarly anti-Christian messages in Hollywood films. If this movie was really about intolerance, the antagonists wouldn't need to be Christians. In fact, it would be better if they weren't, so itcould teach the viewers that intolerance exists outside of Christianity. But the movie really isn't about intolerance, now is it? It's about Christians. Therefore, the antagonists can be none other than Christians. I recently read  urlLink a wonderful exposé on the movie .

      American Dreams is my absolute favorite TV show because it's a mainstream drama that is politically balanced (that is, characters aren't shunned for thinking that maybe sex outside of mariage is sinful or that the war in Vietnam is good).  Mes plus belles années c'est ma série télé préférée absolue car c'est un drame qui est dans la ligne du courant dominant qui est politiquement équilibré (c'est à dire que les personnages se font pas éviter de croire que les rapports sexuel hors du mariage soit péchant ou bien que la guerre au Vietname soit bonne).

      They don't bug me. You know which people do? Multiculturalism/progressivism/tolerance thumpers with a more multicultural/progressive/tolerant than thou attitude. You know why? Because you're just not allowed to disagree with them. If you do, expressing your view is committing a hate crime. They know it all. I'll admit that I'm kinda religious like a Bible thumper but I don't demonize anyone who disagrees with 1% of my views.  Jim

      I've come up with something I like to call Slot Machine Theory. I originally  thought of it to explain psychic mediums who entertain large groups or who do shows on TV. When they do their cold questioning. "I'm hearing an M. Somebody by the name of Mary or Marie." It's like playing slot machines in a casino. That is, it's like being able to play all the machines in a casino with 1 coin. Of course you're gonna hit the jackpot on at least one machine every time. So naturally, multiple people in the audience will recognize that name as a deceased relative.  But this also applies to multiculturalist apologetics. Because human cultures past and present have a wide variety of mores and customs, a multiculturalist can justify absolutely any behavior or practice by just finding one society that tolerates it/tolerated it in the past. (Of course, they'll only dare do this with things that are/were traditionally shunned in western cultures.) An example of this is the Native American two-spirit tradition (their practice of tolerating/celebrating people whose behavior/sexuality doesn't confirm to gender norms). When the multi-culturalists use this argument, they can't lose. I hate it when people do that.

      I tried to post this by e-mail yesterday and MSN told me it got delayed. Since it still hasn't arrived here, I'm gonna post it manually.  Before the day's over, I should say something about Independence Day. Here's a recent thought I had: The whole idea behind today is celebrating the anniversary of our independence from Britain. So why in the world are we surrendering more and more of our independence to the United Nations? Once I started getting educated as to the balance of power and ideology of the UN, I've believed that we should get out of it. Of course, we provide much of the funding so getting out of it would give our government more funds to tend to other business and the lack of our contribution might just result in the UN going bankrupt. Oh how awful! hehe.   Thinking about the UN always makes me think about the European Union. Are they gonna grow and grow to become a one-world government or is Europe just following the governmental models of the US and Canada. Of course, with Europeans being so socialist, even that might result in the fall of the European economy(ies) just like in the Soviet Union. There's something for you to think about.   Jimmy

       Hi all. I'm Jimmy. I'm a strange kinda person in that I have all these ideas and currently have way too much free time so do I get anything done? Of course not. I keep thinking that I should be writing stories... what I do for fun sometimes. I can't say that I always do that great a job but stories are a better way to express political views because they are much more fun to read than essays. And I'll even admit that although I enjoy reading commentaries that align with my political beliefs I can only stand views I disagree with if they are presented in a story form. I'm being way to wordy. Anyway, for a while I have been thinking about creating a web site that will get updated regularly, not just created and abandoned like I usually do. hehe. Last night, I was reading  urlLink a blog  and it made me realize that a blog would be the perfect medium for me to express myself. A little bit about myself. I'm 23, I live in Iowa (USA), and I got brown hair and brown eyes.  later,  Jimmy

       urlLink Microsoft has made the long awaited Windows XP Service Pack 2 available for download from it's web site.  The language on the web site says that it's only for IT professionals and not for people who want to update just one machine. But they offer no way, as of now, for people to download the smaller version for just one machine. You know what? I'm downloading the version for IT professionals to update my one machine. I want my computer to be secure. The language they're using is just to save them from everyone using their bandwidth to download the huge 272391 KB file.  Microsoft suggests people use automatic updates to download it but I don't think anyone should use automatic updates for this. The reason is that it makes profound changes to XP which may make certain programs cease to work. I don't want to come home from work and use the little free time I have trying to get a program to work. I want to do this on a day I'm off, so I'll have all day. Another advantage of downloading it this way is that I can burn it to a CD so I won't hyave to redownload it again, even if the smaller version is only 90MB, that'll still take me almost an hour to download. And what about people with dial-up connections? Should they be made to wait for Microsoft to ship them a CD? Why can't I just share my CD with them?  Jimmy

       urlLink Another example of translation theology.    urlLink Rob Lacey, a performance artist, has interpreted the Bible in his new book,  The Word on the Street . The article really doesn't give enough information about the theology for me to judge. However, I have a beef with the fact that the title doesn't reflect that it's abridged. Also, Lacey said something that gives me suspicians about his theology. "One conservative magazine said there's not enough Leviticus. Well, if you need more Leviticus in your spiritual life, then you need help." On the other hand, he praised Gibson's  The Passion of the Christ .   Jimmy

      When I was a freshman in college we had a guy come and give a talk about his study of African shamans. Basically, his career entailed going from tribe to tribe in Africa in search of cures for incurable diseases like cancer. His viewpoint was that these shamans' medicine was as good as western medicine at curing things like infection, only they used different terminology. For example, one shaman described an infection as demonic possession. At the time, I was naïve enough to believe almost all of what he said. Of course, he left out all the evidence that would have demonstrated that those shamans are no more knowledgeable about medicine than the Salem witch hunters during the Salem Witch Trials, who believed witchcraft was causing sickness and disease, among other evils. He wanted us to go away from his speech believing that the key to humanity's salvation lied in the tribal societies being destroyed by western/capitalist imperialism.  One of the things he left out was the shamans' cure for AIDS. Their cure is sex with a virgin, which results in the raping of very young children.  urlLink A commentary  I read today reminded me of this horrible truth.  Jimmy

      I've watched quite a few episodes of this series and I must admit to myself that this is not a TV show that will help Christians and or Jews to deepen their spiritual journey. This is just another liberal indoctrination show with the classic  gay kid who's been victimized by a religious Christian man  and  deeply religious Christian who's a homicidal killer  plots. This show is more likely to incite violence against Christians than deepen anyone's spiritual journey.  Jimmy

      The latest rumor is that Bush wants to get rid of the IRS and replace it with a value-added tax and or a sales tax. After thinking about it, I'm very confident that a national sales tax would be better for the American people. With fewer (or no?) taxes for corporations, products may be cheaper, a price reduction equal to the extra sales tax. People living in poverty wouldn't have to pay the taxes. The federal government wouldn't steal anybody's money from their paycheck, so poor people won't have to wait till the following year to see their money. This system would encourage saving money. Illegal immigrants and tourists would pay a portion of our taxes. That's right, people who believe America is scum yet somehow find themselves drawn here to spend their vacation will have to pay taxes. Plus, I love change and getting rid of tons of government bureaucracy is a huge change.  Jimmy

         I just finished watching this movie. This is a great movie that deals with morality. What makes it so interesting is the lack of integrity that many of the characters have. Of course, one can't have everything. The main thing I didn't like was the conclusion. It was the politically-correct  Everything's moral as long as you don't hurt anyone and drug's are bad . Of course, most of the  everything's moral as long as you don't hurt anyone  crowd are sympathetic to drug users. However, the main character's (Alan's) father shares my basic views on morality so at least my views were represented by a sympathetic character, something for which to be very grateful in a hollywood movie.     Je viens d'écouter ce film. C'est un génial film au sujet de la moralité. Ce qui le fait si intéressant c'est le manque d'intégrité de beaucoup de personnages. Bien sûr, on ne peut pas en avoir tout. La chose principale que je n'ai pas aimée c'est la conclusion. C'était le politiquement correct  Tout est moral tant que l'on ne blesse personne et la drogue c'est mauvais . Bien sûr, la plupart de la foule  Tout est moral tant que l'on ne blesse personne  est compatissant pour les utilisateurs de la drogue. Cependant, le père du personnage principal (d'Alain) partage mes opinions de base sur la moralité alors au moins mes avis se font représenter par un personnage compatissant, quelque chose pour laquelle il faut être très reconnaissant dans un film de Hollywood.

      In the past few weeks, I've watched  urlLink the remake  and  urlLink the original . I'd like to point out some of the changes in the new version.  In the original version, all the young adults had been raised in the small-town home of Leatherface and they've come back to visit their hometown. In the newer version, the young adults come from big cities that are normal and get stranded in this small town full of seemingly genetically-inferior cannibals who act very strange.  In the new version, the young adults are coming back from a trip to Mexico to buy a piñata full of marijuana. None of this is true of the young adults in the original.  In the new version, two of them are boyfriend/girlfriend who have been living together for three years. In the original, there is no boyfriend/girlfriend and if I recall correctly, they're all related.  In the new version, the hitchhiker blows her head off in the young adults' van. In the old version, the hitchhiker (a male, who turns out to be Leatherface's brother) starts cutting himself. Then he cuts one of the young adults. So they kick him out.  In the original version, one of the young adults is a very immature guy in a wheelchair who's the brother of the owner of the van, as I recall.  The sherif, Leatherface's father, and the convenience store clerk in the new version are a split of one character in the old version, who is the gas station attendant and Leatherface's father in the old version. He's where all sickness of the sheriff came from.  The old version, unlike the new version, has very little cursing.  Jimmy

       Politically Correct Fairy Tales by John Hawkins Are you sick and tired of those "conservative" fairy tales? Are you an American liberal or someone from Europe who thinks those fairy tales teach values that no longer need to be promoted in today's world? Well, RWN is coming to your rescue with our "Politically Correct Fairy Tales!"  =====  Hansel and Gretel  Hansel and Gretel were lost in the woods when they came upon a house made of candy and cake. An old witch invited them in and then captured both of them intending to eat them. Gretel had a chance save both of them by pushing the old woman in an oven but she decided that it would be wrong not to respect the witch's cultural traditions. So Gretel and her brother allowed themselves to be cooked and eaten. The witch was so happy with the children's actions that she invited all of her witch friends to the area. Soon thereafter, they ate every child in a hundred mile radius. Soon the whole area was filled with nothing but child eating witches and all the witches were very happy!  The Moral of the Story: You must respect the culture of others, even at your own expense!  =====  Fisherman and the Fish  An old man finds a fish. The fish says "Let me go, old man. I will reward you for my freedom by giving you anything you desire". The old man at the behest of his wife makes wish after wish. Finally, the fish decides the old man and his wife are being too greedy and takes everything he gave them away. Then the man and his wife hire Johnny Cochran and sue the federal government for not having federal regulations in place to prevent wishing fish from unfairly taking away previously given magical spoils. The judge ruled in their favor and they were both given 500 million dollars worth of taxpayer funds with which they lived happily ever after.  The Moral of the Story: It's the federal government's responsibility to fix every bad thing that happens in the world.  =====  The Three Billy-Goats Gruff  The first and second billy goat gruffs were stopped from going across a bridge to get food by a troll. Then the biggest and baddest billy goat gruff showed up. He told the troll he was going to kick his @ss. That greatly upset the first and second of the billy goats gruff who accused the third billy goat gruff of "hegemony" and "imperialism" and said that negotiation was the way to go. So the third billy goat gruff went away. Unfortunately, the troll refused to negotiate and first two billy goats gruff starved to death.  The Moral of the Story:It's better to starve to death than to fight!  =====  The Three Little Pigs  There were once three little pigs. The first little pig built his house out of straw. But the big bad wolf easily knocked it down. Then he ran to the 2nd pig's house which was made out of sticks. But the wolf came there and knocked it down too. Then both pigs ran to the American pig's house which was made out brick. When the wolf came there, the American pig pulled out a gun and blew his stinking head off. Afterwards, both little pigs who lost their houses started building their houses out of straw again. When the American pig asked them why they accused the American of being an "arrogant jerk" and of "acting unilaterally". But they secretly knew the American would always save them, just like he did in WW1 and WW2 so they could afford not to be prepared.  The Moral of the Story: Even though Americans are helpful, they're real creeps!  =====  The Ants and the Grasshopper  All summer long the ants worked and prepared for the winter while the grasshopper went to Rage Against the Machine concerts and played Everquest. The grasshopper laughed and laughed at the ants for working so hard. Then winter came. The ants had plenty of food and shelter while the grasshopper had none. So the government took the ants tax money and built the grasshopper a house, gave him welfare cheese to eat, and paid for courses at the local university that the grasshopper didn't bother to go to. When the ants complained everyone agreed that they were greedy rich jerks for having more than the grasshopper.  The Moral of the Story: Taking money from people who work hard and giving it to the lazy is compassionate!
