      CURRENT MOOD:  worked up, a little sweaty. CURRENT MUSIC:  thriller  NOTABLE QUOTE:  "this computer has a security system.  it's not the most complicated that i've seen, but it's close.  i think i can override the system and reboot the alarms."  and  "he could have convinced the virgin mary to have sex with him while she was pregnant with jesus."  both by me.  it's my blog, bitches.  i can quote myself if i want.     if you'll notice, the current music is thriller.  i've spent the last couple of hours trying to learn the dance.  no, fuck that, i LEARNED the dance.  yeah, that's right.  don't make fun.  you know when you were a kid and you were watching the thriller video that you wanted to learn the dance and do it for all of your friends.  well, i too wanted to learn the dance, even if it is 15 years later.  besides, perhaps some friends and i will perform this little number at camp booze.  would be funny.    not much going on.  getting stalked, but other than that, shit is kosher.  travis, my mother and i were planning on going to the MD/VA area this weekend for the 4th, but something has come up, so we must stay in town.  on the bright side, steph is coming in, and brian mentioned he MIGHT come in if we can't, so perhaps independance day will be fun afterall.  i'm pretty sure travis, james and natalie are off sat and sun so maybe we can catch some fireworks, THE REAL ONES.  not the ones travis and james will spend the majority of their food money on.      went to bdubs tonight for sarah's last night in town.  had fun, lots of friendly political debate and lively conversation.  my friends rock.    wed or thursday i want to go to athens, OH to see michael moore's new film.  i'm waiting for bear to come in to see it cause i think he'd appreciate it more than most of my friends.  i'm hoping to go thursday cause jesus is also going that day, but since it was bear's idea to do this, i'll go whenever he wants to.   interesting sidenote:  fahrenheit 911 is only playing in one theater in wv, and that theater is in BECKLEY.  you know, beckley, the cultural hotbed of forward thinking in west virginia.  i'm pretty sure "soul plane"  opened in more fucking theaters than that.  i'm out.

      CURRENT MOOD:  sheepish CURRENT MUSIC:  blackstreet (it's 1997 all over again) NOTABLE QUOTE:   travis walking into my house:  "hey jules, you're not naked are you?"  Julie (mom):  "travis, you couldn't handle it."    so yeah, after a long hiatus from the blogging, i must pick back up where i left off.  i have described almost all of my MOV friends...except for the bitch.  no, no, not me.  i'm talking about:  ms. natalie jane case.   readers, dust off your gucci bags, burberry sunglasses, prada jeans, jimmy choo heals, and your gap favorite t's.  if you want natalie to talk to you, you must be wearing at least 2 of these items.  natalie is a walking contradiction.  no, she's not really as materialistic as i said before, but she's trying to be.  she wants to turn her nose down at poor people and roll her eyes at the muslims and tighten her grip on her purse when the blacks walk by...but really, she can't.  she's too level-headed, well-read, cultured, and open-minded to do those things.  while no one enjoys a good racist joke as much as natalie, she's also smart enough to know that those things are un-truths and everyone is really equal, yada, yada...  natalie comes from a bit of money, so she's never really been without anything growing up.  but you couldn't tell.  well, you could from the clothing she wears, but that's it.    HOW I KNOW NATALIE:  worked with her at gap.  hated her immediately.  way too loud, conceited, self-righteous.  eventually i realized those were the same qualities that i possessed, so i gave her a shot.  soon saw the potential in her for making fun of everyone.  one time, shortly thereafter, she made out with travis, but neglected to tell me.  i was pissed off and didn't talk to her for a week.  i thought she was going to take my tnut away from me, cause honestly, natalie is just a conniving bitch.  needless to say, they only made out one more time after that.  if that happened today, however, i'd be all for it.  FAVORITE MEMORIES:  hilton head, as mentioned before.  going to cedar point with her and gap people (200 fannypacks!), R1 and R2, hateful voicemails to each other (are we still friends?), the pink satin comforter new year's eve, jack answering the phone, breaking it down on her couch, yep, still got it, about that....  FUN NATALIE FACTS:  she's a vegetarian, and has been for like 10 years.  she just doesn't like meat.  but she'll eat eggs.  hypocrite.  her great great great great grandfather was VP under calvin coolidge.    she is also lactose intolerant.  love that soy.  natalie does not like to talk about money.  not sure why.  she won't tell how much she spends on anything.  it's so secretive and so unnecessary.  for christmas one year, i gave natalie a picture frame that i painted.  as a joke, i put a picture of my ass in it.  she kept it in there.  go to her house today and ask to see my ass.  she can show you.  one time, natalie had sex in her hot tub (we all know who with), and soon thereafter, jack got rid of it.  try not to soil the hot tub in canaan valley, okay nat?  natalie likes nascar.  it's so fucked up.  she should like horse racing.  do not touch natalie with your feet.  she hates it.  feet totally gross her out.  it's actually kind of phobic.  natalie used to be agnostic (look it up retard), but she recently found christ.  no, not andy.  CHRIST.  welcome back, nat.  everytime natalie IMs me, she's just doing it so i'll post her quotes on my IM.  pathetic.   so natalie's place in my life is SOLID.  she's one of my best girl friends.  for some reason, we don't see each other too much (lazy?), but we talk everyday, and have done so for a long time.  even when she was in chicago, we tried to talk very regularly.  nat is one of 2 people that i go to for unbiased and rational advice. and for the most part, she's right.  nat has helped me become a better person, and i'm grateful for her friendship.  plus, she has a lot of guy friends who are hot, so of course that helps.    i love nattyjules, and you should, too.

      CURRENT MOOD:  reminiscent CURRENT MUSIC:  patsy cline NOTABLE QUOTE:   "i guess i'll just sit here being not funny cause everyone else is sooooooooo funny and i am just taking up space never contributing thought or humor" ----travis bitching about not getting any quotes posted.   still no pictures of the bitch (tsk, tsk natalie), so on with the description of jt.   john hickman III.  jt.  johnny trois.  juanny tres.  johan drei.  yeah, he's an asshole.  but he's OUR asshole, so lay off.     right now, jt is probably the most grateful son of a bitch there is.  last year, he moved to cambridge, OH, a small vacummous resevoir festering with verman, fannypacks and gpc cigarettes.  he lived alone, or until his girlfriend moved in, and then alone again when she moved out.  in cambridge, rather than go to school at the largest university in the world, people decide to keep their jobs at walmart and take the 'short' way to the top of the corporate ladder.  after enduring a dead-end job in a dead-end city with a dead-end girlfriend, jt finally moved back to the MOV a couple months ago.  now he's still in a dead-end city, but at least his cool ass friends are around to keep him company (that's us, bitches).    HOW I KNOW JT:  went to jr. high and high school with him, though never knew much more about him than the fact that he did the pshs news every morning, wore weird leather jackets and kangel hats to school (not in style at the time, though 5 years later...)  FUN JT. FACTS:  i've never hugged him more than 6 times.  we keep count.  snores louder than anyone i've ever heard.  this is a medical issue, and we're working to correct it.  jt is ahead of his time.  jt once said that the gross thing about having sex with a dead body was that it would be cold, nevermind the fact that it would be A DEAD BODY, COLD OR NOT.  johnny trois has never met tony clifton.  john loves pimento cheese spread sandwiches.   FUN JT STORY:  earlier in the year, i had to drive jt all around town and to charleston so he could get his expired license back in order.  got up at the ass crack of dawn, drove all around the city to the courthouse, dmv, insurance, etc.  finally went to charleston in the afternoon.  whatever he did there took exactly 10 minutes.  it was a really nice day, so we decided to hang out around downtown c-town so i could take some pictures and basically avoid getting back in the car for a little while.  went to this awesome store that sold pimp suits, like actual bright purple tuxes with canes and shit.  really fun time.  later, we went to this cool little bookstore/coffee shop and got some espresso and a fun magazine.  while we were sitting outside at a table on the street enjoying the unusually nice weather, this old dirty man came up to us and would lead to this exchange:  dirty man:  hey if i give y'all $5 will you go down to that liquor store and buy me some booze?    jt/me:  uhhhh, we don't know....  dirt:  see, i need this beer.  i'm an alcoholic see, and it's not an option for me not to get beer.  i'm not allowed in that store anymore, so i really need y'all to buy it for me.  it's just $5, you get to keep it for doing nothing.  jt/me:  we don't feel comfortable doing that, sir.  dirt:  y'all look like good people.  i'm a tramp, see, and if i give my money to another tramp, that fucker will just take it and i won't see my booze.  i'm an alcoholic, and i just need me beer.  i'll take a joint if you got it, but really i just need the beer.  jt/me:  look, man, we're just....  dirt:  stutter, stutter, jumble jumble...alright, well thanks anyway.  afterwards, jt and i decided that his shameless honesty was actually quite refreshing, and that if some homeless guy on the street sees us and automatically thinks we're good people, then we're doing alright.     so jt's place in my life has increased exponentially in the last couple of months.  since his move back to the MOV, i've been around him a lot more, and it's pretty cool.  he came up with the hater's squad idea (of which he, james and i are members) and he definitely belongs in it.  his method of shock humor and plain disregard for what's appropriate and morally acceptable is what makes him such an asset to the group.  if you're getting ready for a night on the town, jt will be the first one to tell you that while you indeed look ravishing, your pants make your camel toe stick out more than usual.    hate on johnny trois.  hate on.

      CURRENT MOOD:  hungry CURRENT MUSIC:  bob marley NOTABLE QUOTE:  "i am required by law to tell you that i am a sex offender."   -----sick fuck   alas, we arrive to the very reason the list o friends blog was created.  look alive, readers, for the clouds will be lifted from the proverbial horizon that is andy iafrate.    we call him christ.  not because he's perpetually good, or generous, or sent by his Father to be a door to door salesman of the holy ghost and then later die a particularly gruesome death at the hands of mel gibson.    it's because he's christ-like.  in appearance only, of course.  andrew h. christ is of timid stature.  but what he lacks in physical size, he more than makes up for it with his hair.  if you wanted to make your own andy iafrate, just add 1 part fun t-shirt, 2 parts guitar, and 5 parts hair.  his beard is mountainous, but then it's dwarfed by his uncoifed hair.  his look is wild, grizzly, almost menacing, but then he's got this sweet, soft baby skin on his face and little rose buds for cheeks.  simply adorable.     i don't think i'd be friends with andy if he didn't have that beard.    i haven't known andy for very long, but let's just say he's in.  no initiation necessary.  i'd say bear is still pledging and andy is the damn frat grand poo-bah.  there's something about andy that everyone in the group just kind of latched onto.  maybe it's the beard, maybe it's his sizzling wit and intellectual banter.  whatever the reason, we all love andy.    HOW I MET ANDY:  james brought him over to travis' one night.  after a delightful evening of sitting on the porch, laughing and talking, andy left and jt summed it up best by saying:  "wasn't that guy's beard just awesome?"   FUNNY ANDY STORY:  my friend erin came in one weekend and met andy for the 1st time. we went out to marietta and ended up drinking an incredible amount of that potent brewery beer.  right before we got to travis and jt's apartment, erin really started to feel ill.  since she was horribly drunk, she was all emotional and spazzy and didn't want anyone to see her get sick.  once we all got out of our cars, i tried to shoo everyone into the apartment so no one would see poor erin puking her guts out on the lawn.  well, everyone else is also piss drunk so they want to be heroes and help out.  after severely chastizing jt to get in the fucking house, good ol andy comes outside.  i ask him what the fuck is he doing, and he replies, without any shame or guilt, "i think i'm gonna be sick."  and then he finds a spot next to erin on the side of the apartment and pukes his guts out.  i go inside cause i'm laughing too hard, and while we're inside giggling, erin and andy are becoming fast friends outside puking together.  erin later said that she wasn't so sure about andy until they had that puke fest together and at that point, she knew he was a cool guy.  FUN JESUS FACTS:  he's in a band or two.  go figure.  one time, he brought the house down at bogie's just by himself and a guitar.  real talent.  there's a mario tree outside his house.  he's a political science major at marshall, and hopes that the chicago cubs will win the election this year.  go herd.  you know that guy that does all the voice-overs for movie previews?  you know, the one that says, "in a world of evil and doom, one man must find a way to stop the evil yada yada." well, andy is that guy.  sounds just like him.    so yeah, that's andy.  a real go-getter, he is.  if you don't know andy, hold tight.  he's going on the camp booze experience with us, so everyone bring your bibles.  no need for wine, as long as there's water, andrew h. christ has it covered.    bless me father, for i have sinned.

      CURRENT MOOD:  groggy CURRENT MUSIC:  the song that never ends NOTABLE QUOTE:  "yeah, cause your dad is checking your IM profile from heaven, heather."  can't remember who said it, prolly jt or james, commenting on a certain person's heart-felt tribute to the death of her father in her FUCKING IM PROFILE.   i didn't want to have to do it this soon.  i wanted to put it off, you know, wait a while, take my time and really do it the way it should be done.  well, no one has sent me pics of themselves, so i have no choice but to start on the only person who i have digital pictures of....      bear.      shit.     scott elson.  scottie bear.  or just bear.  no, no, he's not gay at all.  he just has gay names.  it's not his fault.    bear is an anomoly.  he either has a close and personal connection with the devil himself (actually not too much of a stretch), or he is the luckiest son of a bitch in the world.  i'll explain why:   there is no reason, none, that this guy should get laid.  NONE, i say.      here's a list of things that would prohibit any normal human from making contact:  his name is fucking scottie bear.  he has flaming red hair.    he drives a large, green, dodge caravan.  he is completely void of any and all emotion.  and yet, SOMEHOW, bear still manages to get the ass.  we've all been there...it's been a while since you had sex, you don't really have any options, you're starting to look at your friends weird, and then you think to yourself, well hey, at least i've had sex more recently than bear has.  and then the motherfucker comes out and says, uh, no, i got laid last week.    it's not fair, people.  but i have to salute bear for using whatever guerilla war tactics he does to find the pussy, track it down, and beat it into submission.    HOW I KNOW BEAR:  met him through his sister jenny, over at her apartment the 1st summer i met tnut and the boys.  initially was creeped out by that stephen-hawking monotone voice of his, then later came to tolerate him.  FUNNY STORY:  once i got to know bear, i really liked him.  thought he added a nice touch to our friends.  but then, i was outside on the porch with travis and brian one day, when they told me that the reason bear came over so much was because he had a crush on me.  well, i of course believed it since i always think every guy has a crush on me, and i was just APPALLED.  from that day, i hated bear.  fucking hated his guts.  i would get annoyed with his mere presence and would say horrible and mean things to him.  then, like months and months later, i was on the porch AGAIN with brian and travis, and mentioned the time when bear had a crush on me.  well, b and t immediately burst out laughing.  turns out, the WHOLE thing was a joke that they forgot to tell me was untrue.  so i had hated bear for all those months (i can't remember how long, but i know it was 6 months if not a year), for no reason at all.  but don't worry.  we cool now.  BEAR'S QUIRKS:    he stutters.  a lot.  it's fucking great.  and since we've come to know bear, travis and i have stuttered more, too.  i think it's like sympathy pains.  his hand always shakes.  it may or may not be connected to the stuttering.  notice the handshaking levels before and after large quanities of beer or drugs.  like night and day.   bear has a stomach and intestines of steel.  he's NEVER hung over.  you can never tell if bear is happy, sad, depressed, in the middle of testicular mutilation, or has just gotten hit by a bus.  he never changes.  he looks an AWFUL lot like ron weasley, from harry potter.    he and natalie hate each other.  that's why they're sharing rooms on the camping trip.  i figure if we keep them together long enough and keep feeding them booze, then maybe they'll hate-fuck each other to death.  probably not gonna happen.  but yet, in spite of bear's void of spirituality, depth, character and soul, he's actually a great friend to have.  whenever shit goes down in our group, he was always one of the 1st people to drop his shit and come in.  he's good at photography and knows a shitload about EVERYTHING.  he should.  he's been in college for 6 years now.  seriously, i really like bear and he's definitely in my group of friends.   ugh....that felt really weird.  i'm going to take a shower now.

      CURRENT MOOD:  dissident CURRENT MUSIC:  that fucking log song from ren and stimpy (thanks, jrod.) NOTABLE QUOTE:  grand central mall:  it's all here!   after reading part one of the alana's list o friends blog, i've decided that travis' description turned out a little too lovey dovey.  this blog is all about shock humor, man!  it's gotta be edgy, tough, like holy shit did she just say that kind of stuff.  so, rather than begin my description of natalie like i intended on doing, i'm going to rock out and describe one of the most diabolical haters this side of the mississippi:  james.  (also, another reason i'm holding off on everyone else is that i don't have any pictures of you guys.  please send pics to my im or email so i can post them when i talk about you.  i know you conceited assholes will want to have your mug on the net for the world to see.)    so yeah.  james.  what an ass.    his is a complex character.  i'm not even sure how to pick apart his confusing psyche.  i know that he has brown hair, with mad side burns, sometimes wears glasses, can be mistaken for the lovechild of henry rollins and robin williams (in a good way).  but as for his personaility, well, that's a little harder to tackle.    a sample of adjectives:  bitter, angry, pissed, annoyed, vexed, mad, disappointed.  yes, you could say he's a little miffed at the world.  but only because it produces incredibly stupid shitfucks who take up his parking spaces.  if all those retarded emo pinko commies weren't such fuckups, then james would be a lot happier.  he's pleasant, but not in the way that a cool breeze on your ass is pleasant.  it's in the way that you can bitch about anything to him, and he truly gets it.  he'll sympathize because he knows that society is bullshit, man.  HOW I KNOW JAMES:  he'd show up every once in a while when jt lived with travis the first time.  i liked him cause he always laughed at my jokes (i could tell he was laughing cause no one else was).  FAVORITE MEMORIES:  bitching about stuff.  LITTLE QUIRKS:  the man is a whiz at computers, yet dan gets all the business cause his mom pimps him out.  always hungry.  always.  is that your shit sandwich?  sure i'll eat it.  his code name for video games is mongo prime.  fascinating.  he's also in a band called mecko, with dan and adam.  they occasionally play with jesus, too. www.mecko.net  he's captain of the hater's squad.  so james' place in my life is a bit complicated, yet stable at this point.  james knows a thing or two about bitching, but he's actually pretty funny (that says a lot when my group of friends consists of tnut, john, bret), and i do enjoy being around him.  he's a relatively new addition to the group (hey, new to me) and i'm glad he's in it.    so world, feast your eyes upon james...just don't look him directly in the eye.

      CURRENT MOOD:  bedazzled CURRENT MUSIC:  the grey album NOTABLE QUOTE:  none worthy.  work harder, bitches.   after reading, rereading, and then re-rereading my blog (i am truly the most conceited and self-absorbed person.  ever.  even worse than hitler.), i have found that some people may find my name-dropping a little unclear.  for example, who is this jesus christ person i keep mentioning?  we all have a good idea about who the actual JESUS is (something about 2x4s, nails and easter eggs), but who is the one that i talk about?  well, look no further than to alana's list o friends blog.  for the next few days, i will attempt to describe each and every one of my friends who regularly appear in my blogs (those of you whom i don't see on a regular basis are omitted, simply for the fact that i would spend months trying to put all of you on my list.  don't bitch about it.  say something funny and i'll put your quotes on here, but seriously, i have to have some means of criteria).    thus, the fun begins.  since i mentioned the idea to him 13 minutes ago, james has bombarded me with 465 fucking pictures of himself so i can post them when i talk about him.  these pictures are great, too.  narcisistic ass.  however, it would only be appropriate that i start out by describing the light of my life, the one, the only.......................................................  travis. dean. roberts.   he's so hot right now.     he goes by many names:  travis, dean, tnut, nigel, beefy tits, faggoty ass.  but whatever you call him, he's still the same good ol' travis.  his first love, cigarettes.  his second love, his guitar.  his third, halo.  yes, he's a smoking, singing, song-writing, shotgun-toting MACHINE.  he's the poet laureate of shooting you in the face, and then singing a sweet melody to ease the pain, and then blowing smoke in your face to remind you that's he's still #1 at first person shooters.  how i met dear travis:  had small crushes on him, bret and brandon when they went to high school with my sister while i was in jr. high (i've never seen such HOT bowl cuts since then). years later, i dated brandon and after that trainwreck, travis swept in to help mend my broken heart.  i remember taking long drives, listening to coldplay and fiona apple while telling travis that brandon and i really were meant for each other, he just needed space cause of all the pressure of grad school.  ah, such silly naïvité...fiona's album really wasn't all that great.  FAVORITE MEMORIES: too many to be truly representative, but must include his, natalie's and my trip to hilton head in 2001.  lots of corona, cucumber melon shits, helpful hints to the waitstaff at harbor town, and travis' sun-fucked stomach.  also, back massages that inexplicably turned into to near-nipple touches (don't deny it, travis.  you did the same thing to natalie weeks apart.)  getting caught walking out on a $100 tab at bw3's on opening night, and then keying a car at big al's parking lot.  travis and his "sweet baby girl."  THINGS ABOUT TRAVIS THAT NOT EVERYONE KNOWS:  he can turn his thumb in such a way that it looks like he's deformed.  ask him to do it, it's mad crazy.    he eats potato chips first thing in the morning.  he likes chic flicks like the sound of music and little women.  he is lactose intolerant.  poor bastard.    he is actually part vietnamese.  THINGS ABOUT TRAVIS THAT EVERYONE KNOWS:  motherfucker is always late.  he smokes a lot.  his pants never stay around his waste.  he's really quite sensitive.   basically, to define travis' place in my life, i have to say that he is my best guy friend (must include sex qualifier, otherwise SOME people might get offended.  you bitch.)  i see him everyday, and i never tire of him.  he and i are pretty much inseparable, and i like it that way.  since my dad died, people have suggested that travis walk me down the aisle should i ever get married.  while a bit hokey, it's one of the most appropriate solutions cause i don't know any other male figure who has had such an impact in my life.  not even black jay can hold a candle to little tnut.  so yeah, that's travis.  i'll post some pics but they may end up in another entry, but you get the idea.    long live dean, dean, the sex machine.

      CURRENT MOOD:  a little sleepy CURRENT MUSIC:  sir duke----stevie wonder QUOTE OF THE DAY:  "you are jt hickman nobody.  a GUY, that lives in an APARTMENT, in VIENNA.  you don't even make a product." -------james, on one of his many rants.  above rant is about jt not wanting to use bootlegged computer equipment, and james trying to let him know that the government will not audit him cause it's not that big of a deal.  i have been an official blogger for 18 hours.  already, 2 people have followed in my footsteps and joined ranks with blogspot.  yea narcism!!!  here are their blogs:  dan (already had blog, moved to blogspot.com)  http://ampoule.blogspot.com  jared http://jtotherod.blogspot.com   welcome aboard, fellas.   i appreciate everyone's comments on my previous (only) 2 postings.  however, jt...what the shit.  seriously considered erasing your comment.  not sure why...could have been the 'wheel, wheel, wheel' comment, or the fact that you had an ACTUAL INTERNAL CONVERSATION OF A PARAPLEGIC IN THE DAMN WTC.  a new low, i'd say.  however, the comment will remain on my site, as i feel that erasing it would take away from the integrity of my blog. i am an advocate for shock humor, hence your comments remain posted.  must take a nap now.  then, off to walmart with james to buy groceries for my mother and i, and then hopefully to natalie's to pick up gifts from france, eh, spend time with her...   lani

      CURRENT MOOD:  giddy CURRENT MUSIC:  i need another bitch-----notorious b.i.g. QUOTE OF THE DAY:  'so your parents were in the world trade center...were they ON FIRE?'    i apologize for the horrendously offensive remarks about burn victims and WTC.  crazy things happen at the mountaineer.  besides, you can't get mad cause christ said the thing about the towers.  if you get mad at christ, you'll have a shitload of trouble.  god help you.  no, fuck that.  god wouldn't help you.  it's his SON for christ's sake.  how can you expect him to prick over his son like that?  now you're just being unreasonable. but you can get mad at jt, though.  he deserves what he gets.  so yeah, not much is going on since my last post, a good 4 hours earlier.  tomorrow i'm supposed to go to MANPOWER PROFESSIONAL (said in a loud and stately voice), a temp agency.  but i don't think i'm going to go.  for one, i don't want to get a job through a temp agency cause they take money out of your paycheck, as well as the key word TEMP. i've applied for a grand total of 16 jobs since last monday so i think i'm doing okay in the job search.  travis has sworn his firstborn son to me that amity (the drug/alcohol treatment center where he, jt, and james are employed) will hire me, thus i'm not too worried about it anymore.  since natalie has decided to steal my dream of studying in france for an extended period of time (she's SUCH a bitch), i have offered to help tutor her in the glorious language of french.  to help her get started, i'll go ahead and post some vocab and phrases that she'll most definitely need:  VOCAB  niquer: to fuck  ex.  alana nique beaucoup.  (alana fucks a lot) or scott ne nique pas.     (scott does not fuck)   fumer: to smoke  ex.  travis fume tous les temps.  (travis smokes all the time)  la levrette: doggystyle  ex.  les nègres aiment la levrette.  (black people love doggystyle)  okay, now try some phrases:   natalie déteste les pauvres. (natalie hates poor people.)  steph fait les bonnes pipes. (steph gives good head.)  james aime le cul. (james loves the ass.)      okay, now that i've laid down a solid foundation for natalie's french, it's time for bed.    à bientôt  alana "eat your fucking pizza james" raines

         so yeah, i'm a blogger now.  i've been reading the blogs/updates of my friends natty, jt and james for some time now.  i always thought their shit sucked so i decided to make my own blog and show them how it's done!   actually, i just wanted a forum that could totally be about me, and nothing else.  so here we are.  i'd like to start out by thanking dan the man, formally of danzach.  mad props for helping me figure out how to post my pic on the site, attempting to walk me through it, and then giving up and just doing it his damn self.  much appreciated.  also, thanks to travis for helping me pick out my blog title (little less bitch...)    so i guess the purpose of this blog is to talk about myself.  well, i am certainly very qualified to do that.  i'll begin by identifying some lessons that i've learned thus far this summer: 1.  avoid any and all boys by the names of brandon, thomas, grosse.   2.  contrary to popular belief, our lord jesus christ can not hold his alcohol and often resorts to puking on the side of jt and travis' apartment.   3.  i will never find a job.   4.  guys get plastic surgery, too.   5.  sometimes, body parts will swell for no reason.   6.  if you go to slapshots, you can see a band consisting of black people singing heavy metal tunes.   7.  if you need to take a piss at a bar, please do so in the designated restroom facilities, otherwise you'll be escorted from the premises.  8.  when jt sleeps, he often holds his penis in his hand.   so the big story of the summer is the camp booze experience, slated for aug. 5-8.  at the moment, there are 16 people signed up to go.  today i sent the deposit that officially secures our reservations (kudos to bret, sara, brian and marlow for taking one for the team and submitting payment early).  as you can imagine, everyone is very excited to go, except for natalie and bear, who are being forced to sleep in the same bed throughout the trip.  i am sure that i speak for everyone in saying that this development is absolutely necessary, and could be the beginnings of a beautiful, respectful, and passionate love affair.  at any rate, please come back to my blog for regular updates and info concerning the trip, as well news and info about my fat ass.  i believe this will do as a first posting. i'll be in contact soon.  and by soon, i mean way more often than jt, natalie, james, or dan.  why have a fucking blog if you don't update it regularly?  fuck you guys.  i hate you.     alana

      CURRENT MOOD:&nbsp;&nbsp; still sleepy  CURRENT MUSIC:&nbsp;&nbsp; stevie  NOTABLE QUOTE:&nbsp; "those tits feel good against my arm."------jack   &nbsp;   since i am incapable of putting together coherant paragraphs and sentences, i am just going to list some random thoughts i've had this weekend, regarding work.&nbsp; enjoy.   &nbsp;  wow, never noticed how many commies buy cases of beer at 4 in the afternoon (at the compak store with the alcohol, coke, xanax, crank and crack abusing clients).   if i hear one more comment about fucking on a washing machine during the spin cycle by the fat, degenerate, delusions of grandeur-having cook, i'm going to cunt-punt somebody.   do you think cats have substance abuse problems, too?&nbsp; some of these cats look like they are using.   i don't give a flying fuck about your sons, nancy.&nbsp;   bill st. clair doesn't look like bill st. clair.&nbsp; he looks like darrell hammond doing an impression of bill st. clair.   i miss being around normal people.&nbsp;   when kammy says 'pie between the thighs,' it hurts me.   it's gotta suck to be a dolphins fan right now.  when nelly tells me to&nbsp;'flap my wings,'&nbsp;&nbsp;the first thing i think is, 'roast beef doesn't flap.'  surprisingly, the mountaineer has&nbsp;good corn, while mom can't make cole&nbsp;slaw for shit.  that guy from maroon&nbsp;5 is the most fuckable guy i've seen in a long time.  just exactly how many movies has mel gibson been in where his wife dies?  think you need references to get hired at sugars?  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  and yes, i know i've been talking about amity a lot.&nbsp; give me a break.&nbsp; i can't help it.   &nbsp;   more later.

      CURRENT MOOD:&nbsp;&nbsp; tired CURRENT MUSIC:&nbsp;&nbsp; another one bites the dust------queen NOTABLE QUOTE:&nbsp; ''you know gonzo was a jew, right?" -------nick, on muppet babies.  &nbsp;  so i spent all weekend working at amity.&nbsp;&nbsp;not too bad. &nbsp;just about everyone i work with is cool.&nbsp; i worked 13 hours today so i could look good for the boss, hopefully it worked.   my first PI (public intox for the layman) was at 10 in the morning on a weekday, so that was refreshing.&nbsp; had some real sentimental value for the little shirtless dude who called his grandmother a fucking bitch.&nbsp;   my first crisis call went incredibly well, considering he refused to give me any information yet informed me it was MY duty to tell him confidential shit.&nbsp;   my first argument with a client also went well, and by 'went well' i mean that she didn't get too far with her incessant bitching.&nbsp; jt topped it off nicely too.&nbsp; i set em up, he knocks em down.  &nbsp; i realized today how much we need jt and travis.&nbsp; since jt has been working midnights and travis was out of town for roman's bachelor party (WEEEELLLLL), it's really sucked not being able to hang out with them.&nbsp;guys, come home.&nbsp; we need you.&nbsp; andy misses you.&nbsp; james misses you.&nbsp; and i miss you.&nbsp; it's just not the same.&nbsp; the mountaineer is fun and all, but it's missing travis' endless banter and jt's comments about burn victims.&nbsp;  come home...  and speaking of friends not being around, where the fuck is natalie now?&nbsp; has she made it to montana, or fucking ontario?&nbsp; UN ACCEPTABLE.&nbsp; give a bitch a call.&nbsp;   STORIES I HEARD TODAY: one of the cook's sons beat up his roomate for being a faggoty rapist. the other cook has an affinity for serving raw meat. jt can eat raw meat and not get sick.  &nbsp; okay, i'm dying for some sleep.&nbsp; work 3-11 tomorrow, then a reunion with the boys.&nbsp; finally, some people who aren't fucking crazy, at least clinically.  &nbsp; alana 'i read an AA book and now&nbsp; i know everything' raines

      CURRENT MOOD:&nbsp;&nbsp; annoyed CURRENT MUSIC:&nbsp;&nbsp; slow motion, juvenile NOTABLE QUOTE:&nbsp; none worthy.  &nbsp; so i just finished my first full shift at amity treatment center, my new place of employment.&nbsp; i had the priviledge of working with jt and dara, who were cool enough to show me the ropes a little bit.&nbsp; i think i'll like it there, once i get the hang of it and even get a clue as to what is going on.&nbsp; at the moment i'm really green and a little frustrated at not knowing what to do exactly.&nbsp; it's always hard for a bossy and anal person like me to start a new job.&nbsp;   i met lynda, the nurse.&nbsp; she's a bitch.  &nbsp; other than that, not a whole lot is going on besides trying to get camp booze all geared up.&nbsp; 2 weeks away, bitches!  james-like rant: oh yeah.&nbsp; i'm a little fucking sick of constantly hearing from ex-boyfriends.&nbsp; unless i'm calling you or&nbsp; at the very least&nbsp;answering your damn phone calls, take a fucking hint.&nbsp; i'm not your&nbsp; pen pal, or your friend, or even someone you know.&nbsp; i'm someone that you USED TO KNOW.&nbsp;&nbsp; i don't want to hear from you, see how you're doing, and i especially don't want you to know how or what i'm doing.&nbsp; let it go.&nbsp; move on. get a dog.&nbsp; or a fish.&nbsp; just don't fucking call me, e-mail me or IM me.&nbsp; and before you start bitching or crying to me, take a real hard look into the past and see if you can come up with even ONE good reason why i would ever want to talk to you again.&nbsp;   just don't bother.

      CURRENT MOOD:&nbsp;&nbsp; blah CURRENT MUSIC:&nbsp;&nbsp; phil collins NOTABLE QUOTE:&nbsp; "i'm&nbsp; a goddamn athlete." -------andy, flexing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so last night was weird.&nbsp; travis, jt, bear, andy, james, rob, nate and i went to marietta and met up with steph, hash and noah at the brewery.&nbsp; good times were had, the especially potent brewery beer flowed, and the most depressing, annoying, blatantly drunk people ever were present.&nbsp;  &nbsp; the underlying lesson of the night: &nbsp; please be aware when your presence is not welcome within a particular group of people.&nbsp;  &nbsp; other lessons: &nbsp; as a rule, thick bangs should be avoided. white cotton shirts should stay buttoned at all times. bear gives amazing neck rubs.&nbsp; creepy, yet enjoyable.&nbsp;  (sidenote:&nbsp; i did not want to enjoy the back rub from bear.&nbsp; i tried to will my body to hate it.&nbsp; sadly, he gives a damn good massage.&nbsp; i knew that i should not like it, yet&nbsp;it felt good.&nbsp; i couldn't stop myself.&nbsp; it was like rape.) bar fights are never cool. rimjobs are available for the low, low price of $10. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the mackdaddy award goes to travis, who proved that he still posesses the animal magnetism that attracks the ladies.&nbsp; well done, dean.&nbsp; well done. &nbsp; the disciple award goes to andy, obviously.&nbsp; as always, when you take him out in public, one of his followers will surely be waiting for him, and alienate the rest of the group in the process. &nbsp; the impersonating award goes to james, who excecuted a perfect impersonation of jersey trash by revealing his sweater and spitting on everyone around him.&nbsp; uncanny, even. &nbsp; the sportsmanship award goes to travis, who slapped a very drunk rob's ass as he stumbled out of my car.&nbsp; such a &nbsp;can-do attitude should be displayed more often, and by us all. &nbsp; &nbsp; lists of possible names for the people we met last night: &nbsp; &nbsp; the DRUNK italian guy, who kept spitting in our faces inadvertantly, wore a gauzy white shirt that was unbuttoned to his stomach, who kept telling us that he was raised in the bronx and that his car cost more than our outfits, as would most cars. &nbsp; romeo castaway joey buttafuco thad giraldo rocky vinny j-lo jersey &nbsp; &nbsp; woman from the brewery with long black hair with very thick bangs, had an age of 49 years young, and was also very drunk. &nbsp; mary magdeline (one of jesus' friends) carny joey ramone nate's&nbsp; mom howard stern ugly &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so that's all for now.&nbsp; look for camp booze newsletter soon. &nbsp; &nbsp; alana &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      CURRENT MOOD:&nbsp;&nbsp; pissed off CURRENT MUSIC:&nbsp;&nbsp; ryan adams, love is hell NOTABLE QUOTE:&nbsp; "i was either 14 or 15, but i got it." ------me "alana, whatever it is that you do at the abortion clinic is not considered 'birth.'"------jt &nbsp; &nbsp; today is thursday, marking the return of my grandparents for more house renovations, as well as the worst day of my life.&nbsp; i spent the better part of the day painting the basement, though i would have just as easily lit a match.&nbsp; i got paint in my eye, which is an experience that all should enjoy, not only for the warm, burning sensation, but so that all of your immediate and extended family members can stand idly by and watch you wash it out.&nbsp; heart-warming, really. &nbsp; around 5, i thought my luck was changing, as my grandmother prepared a bountiful feast of roast beef, buttered potatoes, corn on the cob, and hot rolls.&nbsp; this was my favorite meal at their house when i was a child, and still is.&nbsp; i was too hot, as it were, to eat a large helping of the meal, so i just ate a few bites and then settled in for a much-needed nap. &nbsp; when i awoke from a lovely slumber filled with dreams of corn, i went into the kitchen to fix another plate.&nbsp; to my horror, my grandmother informed me that while i was peacefully sleeping, my uncle had maliciously&nbsp;eaten all 12 of the remaining pieces of corn.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; my heart broke. &nbsp; this was no ordinary corn.&nbsp; it was Fresh Farmer&nbsp;Corn,&nbsp;the kind you&nbsp;buy at a&nbsp;produce market.&nbsp; when your favorite food is corn, as any of my friends can attest to and also is plainly listed on&nbsp;the favorite foods section of my blog ~~~~~~~~~~~~~>, nothing is worse than not&nbsp;being able to enjoy Fresh Farmer Corn.&nbsp;  &nbsp; that fucking asshole. &nbsp; &nbsp; i really should be more forgiving.&nbsp; granted, Fresh Farmer&nbsp;Corn is delightful, but not life-threatening if one is denied the priviledge of eating it.&nbsp; also, and probably more important, my&nbsp;uncle is retarded.&nbsp; while he's 40 something in physical age, he's really more like 12, mentally.&nbsp; and he is a big guy, so it's likely that normal&nbsp;size portions wouldn't do much for him.&nbsp; and he is a&nbsp;very sweet man, so it's unlikely that he had any knowledge of the pain he was systematically administering to me when he sat down and ate those 12 pieces of delicious, sweet, god-fearing corn. &nbsp; but i'm not forgiving, compassionate, or understanding.&nbsp; i'm judgemental, pissed-off, and&nbsp;hungry.&nbsp; &nbsp;which is why i am currently eating all the doritos i can because they are uncle jim's favorite.&nbsp;  &nbsp; i am involved in a dorito/F.F.Corn battle with a retarded man, who is none the wiser. &nbsp; not my finest hour.&nbsp;  a bit tacky.&nbsp;  depressing, really. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i'm done.&nbsp; and ashamed. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(wasn't really his fault.  just some pesky yellowjackets who have apparently set up a nice housing project in the basement ceiling.  it's like watts, but nicer and whiter.)  besides painting and bitching about painting, i didn't do anything that was of interest today. a little web-surfing, a little i love the 90s, some hgtv (now that i'm bob fucking vila).  oh, came across bret's new blog.  and by 'came across' i mean he IMed me to tell me and then posted his blog on his IM profile.  what a tool.  who does that?  it's like sending out a mass e-mail telling everyone that you have a blog now and they should totally read it so they can be well informed of everything that is happening in YOUR life, what YOU are doing, how YOU feel about it, and how YOUR life affects THEM.  here's the address:   http://www.bretcarr.net/journal  by the way, when you read this blog, in case you can't figure it out, but totally should since it's so fucking obvious, bret is 2nd generatioin indonesian.  adds a whole new perspective to his journal.     i was chatting with james today, and we realized that in about 2 weeks, andrew h. christ will be leaving again for college.  call me crazy, but wouldn't you think that the son of god would be home-schooled?  i mean seriously, what could JESUS possibly get out of college?  does he hang tie-dyed mushroom/turtle tapestries in his dorm, or paint lamb's blood on the walls?  what does he wear to toga parties, and doesn't that just defeat the purpose?  can he eat hot-pockets if he's a heb?  would his dorm buddies like him cause he always has wine handy, or hate him cause he's 'so damned perfect?'  and why the fuck would GOD, THE CREATOR OF ALL BEINGS, send his son to college at marshall??  fuck that.  christ should be enrolled at harvard, dartmouth, or at least fucking devry.    later.   alana 'jesus was a mountaineer' raines

      CURRENT MOOD:  happy CURRENT MUSIC:  fugee la NOTABLE QUOTE:  see grandmother quotes below.     good god.  this week has sucked.  as i mentioned before, my grandparents were in town this week to finish our basement.  upon their arrival sunday, it was agreed that since i'm still technically unemployed, i should help out with the workload.  what the fuck ever.  other decisions included letting mamaw and papaw have my bed, my uncle jim sleeping downstairs on the pullout, mother snug in her own fucking bed and little alana either being locked in the very hot bedroom that has a very twin size bed of nails they call a mattress, or being cast out to tnut and jt's apartment.  i chose the latter.  i did help out with the refinishing, and it was nice to get my hands dirty and actually do work.  plus, papaw slipped me $100 after it was all said and done, so that's awesome.  mom doesn't know about it.  may possibly get money from her as well.  so i made a list of all the inappropriate words or phrases that my grandmother said while she was in town.  keep in mind, while my mamaw is a wonderful lady, very grandma-ish, lots of cooking and the like, she's fucking crazy.  she's about 70, and she's starting to wear out.  raising 5 kids, 3 out of the 5 being total fuck-ups, would do that to you.  anyway, here's the list:  niggertown funny wang weak sperm titless secretary alana, where in the world did you get your butt?  (thanks, mamaw.) what did y'all do last night?  have a john kerry convention?   there's more, but i can't remember them.  anyway, that's my mamaw.   well, that will do for now.  i'll blog again soon.    by the way, i have declared july 10th "national give phil a blow job and make him a sandwich day," partly because of how kick ass he is and partly because i read his blog the other day.  he's in a rut after some bitch ass ho fucked him over, so i think it's all of us ladies' patriotic duty to celebrate this national holiday with gusto and ferver.  on your knees, bitches.    long live illaphilla.   later.  alana "it's a calvert butt and thank you for bringing it up grandma" raines

      CURRENT MOOD:  sleepy CURRENT MUSIC:  mix 100 oldies radio NOTABLE QUOTE:  "can't a fat man eat a biscuit?"----------jt    At 9:01 PM, Anonymous said…  where the fuck is the new shit?    so i haven't blogged lately cause my grandparents are in town and are currently redoing my basement.  thus, my computer is unhooked and holed up in the garage.  i would use jt's computer to blog (like i am right now), but i don't want to do that too often since i'd rather hang out when i'm at their apartment than blog.  so be patient, little rabbit, i will be online hopefully by thursday evening and will promptly crank out a massive blog to make up for my absense.   much love,   alana "i've got your 'new shit' right here"  raines

      CURRENT MOOD:  miffed CURRENT MUSIC:  you've got to hide your love away, beatles NOTABLE QUOTE:  bret's post card from puerto rico (aiy aiy aiy aiy!):  alana y travis, hola!  the weather rocks and the water es muy guapa.  we had (are having) a great time.  maybe we can all come back sometime and get all drunk, i mean, have fun together.  !Rock en Roll en espanol!    bret de la carr   yeah.  whatever, bret.   so i'm blogging twice in one day since i figure i'll be drunk until monday since steph is coming in, it's hash's last weekend and it's independance day.  it should be a booze n bitches kind of time.    i have officially been put in charge of the 4 o july festival at my house on sunday.  or at least, the food part.  i plan on making my famous cole slaw, some nathan's hotdogs, hamburgers and even chicken of some sort.  all are encouraged to attend so my mom will feel loved (you know how jules is.  she's so sensitive).  speaking of mom, she wants to buy the AZTEK HOME MIST TANNING SYSTEM, available only at sally beauty supply.  for those of you who aren't familiar, it's like an air brush kit that sprays tan instead of fun beach sunsets or travis loves alana hearts.  apparently mom wants to be tan and has been hanging out with the likes of jt's mom. if that bitch comes home with a tongue ring and a ho-tag, i'm changing the locks.    okay, what's with our moms lately?  mom's trying to attract black men (the apple didn't fall far from the tree on that one), jt's mom is closing bars down, natalie's mom had too many margaritas at tampico's and had to WALK HOME, and travis' mom never wears a bra.  seriously girls, we need mothers, not skanks.  MOTHER means you give me money, you wash my dishes, you bitch about my room, and you clip coupons.  MOTHER does not mean that you head out to the nip n cue, wear tube tops (my mom owns 2), piss in public places, or ask for another strawberry daquiri to go.  get it together, bitches.   sleepy.   alana "i'm going to shoot travis in the face in honor of trooper jim" raines

      CURRENT MOOD:  frenzy CURRENT MUSIC:  kanye west NOTABLE QUOTE:  "sucks, don't it?"   -----security guard at the mall who towed james' car for no apparent reason.  james almost killed her.   big ups to dan for fixing my blog and putting my personal info stuff where it should be.  you work the computers like no other.   so we went to see spiderman 2 last night.  great flick:  excellent fight scenes, special effects, good storyline and ending.  i wanted to kick bear's cousin mark after the movie ended.  we were leaving the theater and everyone was abuzz with discussing the movie, and he goes, "well, that movie sucked."  we all kind of looked at him funny for a second and then kept walking.  personally, i don't see what else that movie could have done.  it had action, suspense, humor, and even a little romance for the ladies.  yes, there were cheesy parts, but IT'S FUCKING SPIDERMAN.  he shoots cob webs from his wrists and climbs walls.  his enemy in this movie was a guy who nailed 4 arms to his back, who just happened to be named dr. otto octavius.  no shit it's cheesy.  i'm assuming mark would have only been happy if spiderman had hemp dreadlocks and shot PCP out of his ass.    i've been reading a book that natalie bought for me in paris.  it's called "c'est pas le pied!" which roughly translates to, "it's not the foot!"  nat admitted that the only reason she bought the book was because it had a pair of shoes on the front.  natalie likes shoes, so natalie bought book.  fortunately, it has turned out to be a wonderful read and i'm thoroughly engrossed in it.       because of the comic book movies that i've been seeing lately (spiderman, x-men, etc), and a conversation with travis and jt, í've been thinking about what my special powers would be if i was a super hero.  i just can't figure it out.  it would be nice to be able to fly, but i'm afraid of heights.  reading minds would be useful, but i'd end up using it on boyfriends and who REALLY wants to know what their boyfriend is truly thinking?  rather than contemplate my own super powers, i'll figure out the powers of my friends.  here's a list:  bear:  can drinks gallons of liquor and not get sick, or when he touches people under the influence, he takes their high for himself, and leaves them sober.  jt:  sprays pimento cheese spread from his wrists and kills opponents by free style rapping them to death.  travis:  as long as he is in possession of his bionic hotdogs, he has the power of 10 men.  if his hotdogs are lost (or stolen), he is powerless.    natalie:  dressed in her gucci cape, natalie can turn any substance into soy, and controls all the bling in the galaxie.  she is constantly fighting the fannypack clan, who threaten the world with their bad taste and sears charge cards.  bret:  fueled by the collective power of all homosexuals, bret can trap opponents by his rainbow flag nets, and kill them with his poisonous pink triangles.  secret headquarters are located at the true colors night club in parkersburg.  steph:  seduces men and then kills them mid coitus.  especially lethal to black men.  brian:  renders opponents powerless by dancing a jig when in battle.  his ultimate powers are enhanced whenever someone does the electric slide.   so that's all i could think of.  feel free to come up with super powers for me and post them in a comment.   later.

      CURRENT MOOD:   nervous CURRENT MUSIC:   REM NOTABLE QUOTE:   1.  "just because they're reading the bible doesn't mean they're not looking at your boobs." ---------me, to erin, trying to convince her to go to church to meet boys. 2.  "dude, if they're that age and going to church, they're going cause they love the lord." ----travis, to me, on why going to church to meet guys is futile.     nothing new.  just had to post the quotes.   oh yeah, remembered some camp booze stuff now that my head isn't quite as cloudy.   lessons learned:  bear + marlow+ miller lite+bush v. kerry debates + gay marriage+ abortion = never should have fucking happened.  sitting by a fire and having everyone list their favorite movies/actors (val kilmer)/bands/cds/songs is just awesome.  definitely one of the highlights of the trip.  that bitch that was running somewhere between bridgeport and the woods had to been retarded.  no one runs with that bad of form.   i should have known that i wouldn't be able to complete my camp booze experience without thanking thomas.   one should always think before they say anything.  i should never drink more than one glass of wine at a time.  if you're going to play poker and/or asshole, make sure someone has a rule book.  ("what do you mean 5s are fuck you's?  what the hell does 'fuck you' mean?"..."it means drink, bitch.")  towers made of miller lite cans, although completely necessary and awesome, fall very easily.   especially if drunk bitches try to set up a tripod around them.          that'll do, donkey.  watch for pics and roman's wedding news.  yea monogamy!   lani.

      CURRENT MOOD:   happy from shopping. CURRENT MUSIC:   eternal flame----bangles.  no idea why.  just kinda popped in there. NOTABLE QUOTE:  "i don't know whether to ask her how her day has been, or put her in the game." ----------------travis, on terri, a lesbian at work.     recently seen on bret's blog:  "Also, have you checked  urlLink Alana's  website for an update? I smell a worker bee who's too lazy after work to update with all the quotes from the weekend."                you're goddamn right.      so yeah, camp booze was fantastic.  i waited 3 days and i still can't process what all went down.  the cabin that we picked turned out to be huge and had a wonderful rustic ambiance that lent itself to babbling brooks and fresh air.  or something.  we bought food/alcohol beforehand, which was funny cause my mom jules had to buy the alcohol for us cause she's the one with the sam's club card.  she looked like jt's mom buying 210 cans of miller lite.   since it's all kind of a blur (damn that wine), i'm just going to list some quotes that we kept and perhaps a few little stories that i can remember.   memorable quotes:    i'd want to be robert deniro's son cause then i'd be knee-deep in pussy.-------scott.  i'm not a good-looking guy, so i have to TRICK the girls into doing me.------scott, more drunk.  everyone gets nausious when they get in the hot tub with me.---------------scott, almost dead.  favorite actor:  val kilmer  MIND THE COONS!------andy  their menustration attacts bears.  bret, while cooking, 'i'm fucking bored.' ------'now you know what it's like to be a woman.' --brian  JOHN KERRY IS SOFT ON TERRORISM!!  rarely sober...rarely so-BEAR.-----travis, on bear.  the daddy longlegs...the most poisonous snake this side of the mississippi.-----lani  take THAT america!--------andy  awww, travis, this is our song----brian, after ben folds five's 'brick' comes on.  'yeah, it reminds me of when you got that abortion.' ---travis  oooohhhhhhh.  julia roberts.  gum my pee-pee...with your horse teeth.-------andy  RIVER PHOENIX'S CORPSE.  alana, in reference to julia roberts.  "she's prego?...she's salad dressing?"  jesus, you're up.--bret, to jesus.  'GODDAMNIT!' --jesus  okay, let's talk about doing it.  cause this wine goes straight to my crotch.   ------alana  all i know is that i went over to see scott and when i came back i had sticky fingers.----brian  travis:  i'd totally screw mary from the bible.    steph:  which one?    jesus:  the tight, tight virgin.  i was 14 when i was blowing people, but i was 18 before i had sex.  -------alana.  damn wine.  you cum-guzzling whore...shut the fuck up.----travis, to alana, immediately after prior comment.  eatin' ain't cheatin.'  sara won't be here until tomorrow.------bret  nah, man.  i ain't givin' her a yeast infection.--------bret  being the jesus is like being in a boy band.---------andy, in response to questions about his sexual partner number.  i'm getting nailed here...--------------jesus  you can either write it down in the quote book, or act on it.---------luke.  HEY OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!!!  camp booze anthem 2004.               funny stories:  bear was single-handedly the drunkest person i've ever seen for 3 days straight.  he doesn't have a liver, it's a damn sewage system in his torso.  also, on the ride home, bear was shaking like a motherfucker.  way more than usual.  and i think he only smoked 2 cigarettes.  weird.  even he was surprised.  andy was dared to run naked from one part of the deck to another part, very far away.  he did it.  i saw a divine ass.  great memory.  never bring jack johnson to a camping trip.  bret and alana make the best burgers in the world.  99 degrees is the perfect temperature for a hot tub.  one of my best memories from the camp will be when we first woke up each day and had some coffee.  really a good time to be with most of my closest friends.  awwww saps.  i've never smoked so much in my life.           alright, that'll do it for now.  i'll post some pictures sometime tomorrow, (IF PEOPLE SEND THEM TO ME).  and then this weekend it's off to roman's wedding with my date, dean dean the sex machine.  should be fun.     alana 'it's embarrassing to read quotes that i said that i don't remember saying but i'm pretty sure i would have cause all the wine that i drank makes me lose all concepts of appropriateness or however the fuck it's spelled don't make fun of me i'm a really good speller though it wouldn't seem like it from camp booze" raines

      CURRENT MOOD:   happy CURRENT MUSIC:   the sound of crickets chirping.  motherfuckers. NOTABLE QUOTE:  see below.   ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS FOR MARCO POLO:  "cross!"..."jesus!"  "donkey punch!"..."alana!"  "cleveland steamer!"..."alana!"  "lord of the..."balls!"  "my sweet baby"..."girl!"  "marco!"..."faggot!"  "marco!"..."sparkles!"  "marco!"..."i'm over here!"  "spiderman!"..."gonzo!"  "rim!"..."job!"    so over the last couple of days we've been swimming at scott's aunt's house.  really fucking cool.  for some reason, even though the youngest among us is 21 years old, we can't get enough of marco polo.  the first day it was all innocent, but apparently scott and james figured out that they can grab my boobs and blame it on their eyes being closed.  whatever.  at least you're trying to get some.  i was starting to worry.  CAMP BOOZE IN 2 DAYS!!!  oh snap!  very excited for the trip now.  i thought only a few would be going on thursday, but turns out that just about everyone will be there that night sometime.  except sara.  and you can TOTALLY bet that she's going to have to give everyone hand jobs as soon as she gets there to make up for her absence.   just read the weather report.  says the highs for the weekend will be in the low 70s.  not bad.  wouldn't mind a bit hotter, but at least we won't die of heat exhaustion.  everyone, plan accordingly.   STILL NEED CAR INFO FROM BRET, SARA, LUKE, NATALIE, MAYBE NOAH.  sidenote:  way bummed that jt and james can't go.  we'll take loads of pictures for you guys.     so once the booze hunting trip is over, we have roman's wedding next weekend in morgantown.  i have 2 new dresses for the occasion, one for the rehearsal dinner, and one for the wedding.  i look outstanding in both.  looking forward to making out with roman's hot engineering friends, if such a thing exists.  but really, it will be nice to be apart of roman's big day.  i think he and amber make an excellent couple and will enjoy a wonderful life of hugs, smiles, babies, and timeless catch phrases.  WEEEEELLLL.  aight.  off to bed.  big day of cpr training with tnut, erin is coming in for the booze experience, and the food/beer shopping spree at sam's.  probably won't blog until sunday night sometime.  check back for camp booze quotes and pics.  much love.  alana "blame it on my vagina" raines
