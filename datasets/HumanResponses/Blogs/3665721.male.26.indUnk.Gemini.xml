      I didn't make a Blog entry for Sunday, I am not sure why, Sunday was Father's day so I went and ate lunch with everyone but my brother who was working.  Got the usual lectures and yelled at about stuff that I don't have control over.  Maybe one day they will figure out that I might have more respect for everyone if they would just treat me like a human being and not find every reason to lecture me or say something that's just going to make me not want to listen...  Monday... Well at 4p.m. I officially came off my vacation 2004.  I do have another one to take sometime before November, but I will have to see if I stay at Eckerd that long.  Yesterday was not a fun day at all.  I started realizing that all the fun from last week was coming to an end and I would be going back to a routine that I really don't' want to be a part of.  And as soon as I walked through the door of Eckerd it was like the Drama was going to begin all over again.  Maybe not directly with my life, but with other areas of the store.  For example.  The pharmacy: We have one pharmacist who is due to deliver her baby sometime in July, but hasn't worked in probably 3 weeks now.  She has complained and whined and really made pregnant people look bad.  We had another girl who has probably had her baby by now and probably worked up until the moment she delivered.  But since the pharmacist "can't do anything" it has created a massive mess for our pharmacy and they are short staffed due to other employees finding another job and this week our other regular pharmacist and our regular tech are on Vacation...  This should be a great week.    Lizabeth's family is going to Jekyll Island for the weekend of the 4th of July.  I was trying to work out a way for me to go, but I'd be going alone and I don't see why I am going to go, but pay a massive amount for a hotel room when it's just me.  But I was gonna try and work it out.  Well Amy, my boss, tells me that on the morning of the 4th of July I have to come in and learn how to do something so that the week she is on vacation I can come in and do it for her.  Well that is fine, but now that ruins my whole weekend...    My other option for the 4th weekend is Chris' birthday and after last year I don't know if he will have any girls around.  Last year a girl that he was seeing decided that she didn't like him very much and wanted to be with me that night.  And we all ended up getting very drunk, she ended up loosing most of her cloths one the balcony, Chris went to bed, she wanted to come in my room andI told her she had to sleep on the couch and I gave her a trash can to puke in.  Well she ended up puking everywhere, and she never even cleaned it up.  She took some of Chris stuff and wansn't planning on giving it back until he made a big ass deal about it.  Once he was sober that day and we were feeling better I told him everything that was said, and we really haven't talked to her since.

      After Funneling 10 beers on Friday night, Saturday morning became a not so nice time.  It was like the Saturday nights when I would come home on the weekend from NGCSU.  I didn't funnel 10 beers, but I would drink a pitcher of beer on my own and then, drink whatever when our friends would show up at Barnacles.    I think I was drunk until about 3p.m. today or maybe a little later.  I had to go over to my parents house and I ended up spilling my powerade in the truck of my car.  I just hope I cleaned it up enough so that it's not still a sticky mess.    After that annoying fun, it was time to head to HiFi Buys for the HOT 107.9 Birthday Bash, now last year I swore I never would work that show ever again.  So why did I agree to work this year?  I will never know.  It started off more organized than last year, but ended up being just a crazy and out of control at times.  Especially when my job is to only let people with passes threw the gate and then stupid people backstage are overthrowing what I have been told.  I guess a cool thing is that the singer Monica ended up sitting in a row right in front of me.  I ended up letting her and the entourage leave by going backstage.  WHHHAATTT, YEEAAHHH, OOOOKKKK

      I have offically matched the most beer I have ever drank in one night... 9  I did 9 a few years ago on New Years Eve waiting for Midnight.  We were playing some drunk board game, and I drank like 3 beers in 20 min and then passed out like 20 seconds after midnight...  Which made someone really mad, but I don't give a shit. hahahahahhahaha  THis time I have funneled 9 beers, I am going to wait a few minutes and then go for 10.  Just to see if I can make double digits.  I will probably puke my guts out but hell, it's my vacation and I can do what ever the helll I want to.  I already went to Myrtle Beach, visited Sarah in Milledgeville, and went to Tim McGraw!!!  Which was one hell of a concert.  I can't wait for Kenny Chesney to come to town, that should be even better.  I seriously haven't been this drunk in a very very long time.  I am chatting with Sarah online, which I hope I can remember.  I can hear Andrew talking in the other room with Nick.  I hear the TV and I think it's Conan O'brian.   THis has been one hell of a week and I have had so much fun, it's gonna suck to be back at work at 4p.m. on monday...  I wish I started blog a long time ago, but oh well.. so many things in my life needed to be written down. but they are all lost in time, in the history of my life.  I am gonna have beer 10.  Good god, I can't see straight.  I don't know what to type.  So many times in my life that have been so much fun.  So many things that I have let go.  I know many of those things were good to let go, but others I am not gonna stop.  I respect ppl for who they are and what they believe in and that's not going to change!!!  Everyone has gone to bed, so I am gonna write for a little while before I pass out.  I still have tears in my eyes and I can't explain why at all.  I have been very drunk before, but this time I am suprised that I am still able to type.  10 beers is alot for me.  If I puke in the morning that will be a new journal entry but if not.. HOLY SHIT!!!!  I    would probably call sarah right now but I can't even make sense to myself.  and she just went ot bed so she would be liek why the hell are you calling me. jk  Lizabeth hasn't talkted to me all night.  she was working and stuff.  Sallie has gone to bed early on the account of she was bored.    Good nighnt everyone I know I shoud wrtie more but I will save that for another night!!!

      I have been working at concerts for almost 2 years now.  It still amazes me how many people have to be on the front row for what ever reason.  I have been spoiled because my supervisor works the front of the stage and that gives me a 95% chance that I will be working in that general location.  There has been a few times where I have had to work some bull shit areas, but for the most part I am right up front.  Last night I had lawn tickets to Tim McGraw, that is one of the first times I actually stayed out in the lawn for a concert at HiFi Buys Ampitheater.  Most of the time I work my way to the front of the stage or down to the 100 sections.  I have been on the front row a few times and it is absolutely crazy. (People pushing, shoving, yelling at you, spitting, biting, madness) When I make it down there I talk to my friends and then move a few rows back.  Last night I got as close as the front of the 200's and talked to Paulette who told me that they were being strict last night soo I hung out got a few pictures and retreated back to the lawn. It's a more festive atmosphere in the lawn.   Last night was also the first time I have paid for a concert where I was confused how it ended so abruptly.  I have worked shows where I have thought the show ended in a strange way, but this was by far the weirdest.  The band was still on stage, and Usher's "Yeah" Started playing and the house lights came on.  Everyone was kinda standing there dazzed and confused.

      Memorable Moments at Myrtle Beach Summer 2004: -My brother, Sean, turning ghost white and puking into the ocean. -The 14 year old girl on the oposite balcony trying to talk to us and the dad with the binoculars yelling out 14!!!! -The dad with the binoculars checking out people on the beach, walking down the road, and the people on the balconies on our side...

      While walking on the beach at 1a.m. one tends to notice many things: Many people are sleeping, others are still cruising on the strip.  Some groups of people are playing on the beach, couples are walking down the beach, some people are playing in the water, a random man has a metal detector searching for a treasure that was lost by someone during the day.  People with flashlights are looking for creatures that have come up from the sand or have been washed in from the waves.  The wind is blowing lightly the salt is in the air.  The waves are crashing, the water moving and then retreating back into the sea.  The foam bubbles left popping wondering why they have been left behind.  A sea gull makes a noise and dips down for an interesting treat.  You look out into the sea a little ways out you see the water rippling toward the shore, further out it gets darker and darker, you feel as though you are floating threw space.  You hear the noises of kids laughing in the distance, you look to the north and see a line of hotels and lights and a few people playing in the water and on the beach, then you look to the south and see more hotels and lights and a few people walking, you see pier 14 disappearing into the darkness.  You hear the waves swooshing the bubbles of foam popping.  The water rushes around your feet and as it leaves you have the feeling you are sinking as the water takes away the sand around your feet.

      I woke up with a monster headache today and it just hasn't gone away.&nbsp; I have taken stuff for it and still it hasn't gone away.&nbsp; Lizabeth has had one all day too, and I think Sarah has too.&nbsp; Stupid headache needs to leave us alone!!!!  I hung out with Lizabeth and her brother and sister today.&nbsp; It was fun, we had gone by wal-mart and saw Carl and then I went and picked up my pictures at Eckerd from the Kenny concert.&nbsp; I will have to work on posting those on yahoo at some point.&nbsp; Then we went back to Lizabeths for lunch, then we went to the mall and hung out.&nbsp; Went by Ruby Tuesday's and had some cheese fries.&nbsp; At some point lizabeth realized it was Aarons birthday and we had plans set out for tonight to go out to eat.&nbsp; Before heading over to Monica and Aarons we stopped by my brothers Eckerd to make sure that they weren't going to fire him on the stop.&nbsp; Something was going down, cops were everywhere.&nbsp; They had a guy surrounded that had run into the woods and they were doing a manhunt... It was awesome.  We went to Logan's Roadhouse for Aarons birthday dinner.&nbsp; It was crazy talking about seeing people moms and grandmothers in thongs and then seeing our dads in speedo's or something, waiter even walked into one of those nasty moments and he was scared to come over to our table again...  Random funny quotes: "What do you want to do today?" "Get Laid" There was a cherry in the parking lot next to someones car..... "I think someone lost their cherry in the parking lot." Licesne plate AJY... "A Juicy YAYA" Aarons magot story.. him haveing to run out of a porta potty with his pants around his ankles. "Lets go to the strip club." "Come back and let's play in the rain, there isn't any lightning" "OH MY GOD, lightning" "If you say anything else he might just get up from the table and leave." Lizabeth's sister "I like playing with balls...."  Right now I am frustrated on alot of things... I haven't started looking for a job yet... Well that's kinda not true.&nbsp; Right now I have talked to many of my friends to see what they do, and see if they are hiring.&nbsp; I have a few leads... I can be a host at Joes Crab Shack on Pleasant Hill.. can't be a server do to I sold Alcohol to a minor and it's on my record...&nbsp; Mark, a guy I work concert security with is going to need some help with his landscaping company... Lizabeths parents were checking into things for me, but they aren't hiring... Aaron can get me in with his construction company.&nbsp; These are all intresting things, but I am not sure, but I also can't wait forever.&nbsp; I need a paycheck... I have to keep this apartment!!!!  2nd. I have two really great "Girl Friends", that I would do anything in the world for, but I can't seem to meet anyone to be a girlfriend.&nbsp; I don't know what it is about me, I don't know why I care.&nbsp; I want to head to Atlanta a pick up some stupid ass slut and just do whatever the hell just happens... I don't know... probably not the best idea.&nbsp; Actually that isn't a good idea at all.&nbsp; Those people are gross.&nbsp; They probably have fungus of the mouth, nose, ears, feet, hands, ugh who knows what else is growing on their bodies.&nbsp; AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!&nbsp;   The internet died so going to Atlanta sounds like a ton of fun.&nbsp; But no I can't do that.&nbsp; Sarah would kick my ass.&nbsp; Lizabeth would probably too.&nbsp; I hate when this happens.&nbsp; I just want to curl up in a ball and wake up from this real life of mine.&nbsp;   I guess I could give some advice to sarah.. would rather be on AIM doing this, but I can't because the damn internet died!!!!&nbsp; Let's see, so you got the dreaded e-mail that your dad is going to take this job.&nbsp; I am soo sorry to hear that they decieded to take that step, but at the same time it's what they need to do.&nbsp; Maybe he will continue to look for something in the Atlanta area while working out there to maybe come back and get something with better pay.&nbsp; I don't know how long your parents have lived in that house, and how many memories that you have had in that house, but I do know how hard it will be to realize that it won't be your "home" anymore.&nbsp; Don't dwell on the years that you didn't spend with them... Those years are something that needs to be left in the past and you can continue moving forward with your parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know things have been rough with your dad lately, but deep down he cares.&nbsp; It sucks that when and if you come to Lawrenceville you won't have your home... but hell if you need a place to stay for a few days to hang out with friends, party at wild bills, or do whatever you can always stay here.&nbsp; And if you need a friend to drive with you to South Carolina and no one will go, I will try to be available for a road trip!!!&nbsp;   Hmm I need to bitch...&nbsp; I made a decision on the way home from Monica and Aarons to drive through Alexis' old neighboorhood.&nbsp; 1 I wanted to see if I could tell if any of the old neighbors were still there.&nbsp; I was kinda friends with them, hell many of those people I had know for almost 6 years too. 2)I wanted to see how the neighborhood has changed in the past year.&nbsp; 3)Lizabeth made some comment about how she knows I still love Alexis.&nbsp; I care about Alexis, yes, love her, not in any big way like I did maybe 6 months ago or even a year ago or not even 2 years ago.&nbsp; I will always have a place in my heart for her.&nbsp; She has treated me like shit in the past and somewhat even know.&nbsp; She is getting to a point where she can actually talk to me without being a total bitch to me, and I think she has finally realized that she is ok with just being friends with me, all of her major feelings that she had for me and her getting back together are now gone and she doesn't have to worry about feeling guilty that she talked to me.&nbsp; She is happy and that is good.&nbsp; We didn't have a happy relationship at all.&nbsp; TONS of people told us that.&nbsp; We should have just ended everything when we were in High School, we should have ended before we hit 6 months.&nbsp; But we were too stupid to listen to anyone.&nbsp; OH WELL it's done it's over, if Alexis came to me tomorrow and told me that she wanted to get back together I would laugh.&nbsp; Yes my life has been total hell, and things seem to keep falling apart, but eventually I HOPE this will turn around.&nbsp; I just don't know when.&nbsp;   I would love to fall in love again, falling in love is so much fun.&nbsp; Being able to trust someone in that situation&nbsp;again is going to be hard as hell.&nbsp; For some reason I trusted Ashley, but then she decided to turn on me... Grrr stupid shit.  I told my roomates and everyone who comes over they need to limit the smoking of illegal crap to Friday and Saturday nights... I don't know how long this will last since some stupid people don't listen... In fact it's 1a.m. and we have stupid loud shit going on outside, and I don't feel like being daddy right now... I feel like venting...&nbsp; Actually I am going to go yell at them in about 5 min.&nbsp; I am sick of the stupid shit that keeps going on like shooting my bro in the nuts with a b.b. gun and punching each other and the puking.. It's really getting old.  Well I am very tired and I've been very tired for many hours sooo I think I am going to head to bed.&nbsp;

      I knew from the get go after last year today was going to be a long ass day and I knew I was going to have to make the best of it and try to remain in a good mood.&nbsp; I have to say that I was happy to be guarding a stage instead of checking people at the front gate.&nbsp; The only thing was we originally had 5 people guarding the two stages that were&nbsp; on the big stage at HiFi Buys.&nbsp; Some of the bands had quite a few crowd surfers... Or should I say people that were launched up 10 to 15 feet into the air landing very close to the steel barricade wall.&nbsp;   They did bring in reinforcements but there were a few bands that didn't have a big following and a lot of people got bored and since we didn't really have a supervisor many of those people wandered off to other areas and never came back.. So at the end of the night we only had 5 people again and crowd surfers were coming 2, 3 and 4 at a time and we are supposed to back each other up... Which was very hard to do. Especially with these people who were being launched out of the mosh pit into the air... We barely had time to see them coming.&nbsp; I got kicked in the side of the face and smashed in the nose and mouth... That really didn't feel so good, but I didn't break anything and I am still conscious so I'd say that is a good thing.   Chris got sent out of the pit and had to do some guarding behind a fence somewhere and he wasn't too happy about that.&nbsp; He also got yelled at for eating some chicken wings that weren't his or something like that.&nbsp; Chris had also helped some crowd surfers during the early part of the day and one of the purposely hit him in the nuts... That was kinda funny.   I had some quotes from the day but I really can't remember them and it might be because I am really tired... But here goes.   "These kids suck."  "This wouldn't be so bad if we knew these bands."  "These people are watching us and we are giving them free shit."  "I think I am going to get fired today."  Black man says "All the white people over here with me, all the black people go over there."  "Do you know where this stage is?"  "Do you know what time this is?"  "Do you smell that?"  "I think I just saw a 10 year old smoking..."

      Well today was another not so good day...&nbsp; I found out that all the concerts I thought I would be working this week became only 3..&nbsp; Not good.&nbsp; Actually once I got to HiFi Buys tonight I might be working 311 on Saturday for someone so this could be ok.&nbsp;   tonight's show didn't do much for me.&nbsp; I was very disappointed in the selection of songs played.&nbsp; Plus it has started to hit me that I don't have my job anymore..&nbsp; I was really down for about 30 minutes before the show started.&nbsp; Chris tried to give me inspiration but it didn't help much.&nbsp;   Earlier in the day Lizabeth, Carl and I hung out.&nbsp; It was cool.&nbsp; We went to my old Eckerd and brought my film to be developed from Kenny... I'll pick that up Thursday.&nbsp; We went to Subway before that for lunch.&nbsp; And then we went to the pool for a little while and goofed off.&nbsp; Carl was like talking about how he was going to bring up Japan so that we could hear some Japan stories.. He didn't say shit about it sooo I started it for him. It became this funny ass thing for the night... I got a crap ton of quotes from the ride to HiFi Buys and then stupid shit before the show started.   Stuff I asked Chris or said:  "Do they have billboards in Japan?"  "What kind of strippers do they have?"  "I think his tire is going to fall off"  "If you hit that girl she would put a dent in your car."  "You paid $700 for your security system, why didn't you just hire someone?"  "You better pay me back before you re-tint your car."  "Even the vendors ignore him."  "If I hear one more thing about Laura..."   Stuff Carl asked Chris or said:  "Do they have these kind of cars in Japan?"  "Has Dave Matthews ever been to Japan?"  "How come all the paramedics are fat?"  "What do they need all those guitars for?"   Stuff Chris said:  "Go you fuck nut"  "Tell me if you see a cop I am going 90."  "I swear to god I am going to slap you in the nuts."  "In the grave yards in Japan they just burry you on top of other people."  "I got a good deal on my tire."  "Another thing is..."  "I tried to turn in my two week notice and they wouldn't let me."  "Nobody is answering their phones."  "When I got fired from QT..."  "Crack your brother in the nuts with that."  "I don't know my pin number."  "For a 15 year old she has a nice rack."  "It's like finding a needle in a bunch of needles"  "Go take a gander...."   Drew:  "Remember that time Billy said he was going to take a shit and we all went in the restroom and found a stall with someone sitting on the toilet and we pounded on the door yelling "What the hell are you doing in there" and it was someone else and the guy goes "I am just trying to take a shit man." and then we notice Billy standing at at the trough."  "How dumb do you have to be to tell on yourself."   Ben:  "I have some friends that are bi-sexual that like hot lesbians"   David Brown:  "Their director of security doesn't like us."   Random:  "Is that a joint?, It could be a tampon for all I know."  "Oh my god, my grass has been taken."  "Dude this band sucks."  "Help Help Mr. Craig get me some food."  "Kick his ass and get us up front."  "Jeremiah was a bullfrog."

      No I did not get someone pregnant... I left that for Carl to do...&nbsp; Sorry had to do it.&nbsp;   On a serious note.&nbsp; This December I would have been at Eckerd for 9 years.&nbsp; 9 YEARS!!!!&nbsp; Crazy.&nbsp; The company isn't what it used to be.&nbsp; I think it is still going downhill even though many changes are to be expected over the next 6 months or so.&nbsp; I've wanted to get out of Eckerd for a Long time now, but it's almost like I was trapped in a way.&nbsp; I was working crazy hours and when I wasn't at work I didn't want to deal with anything else really.&nbsp; Just chill or rest.&nbsp; At one store I was at I worked close to 60 hours one week and like 55 hours another week.&nbsp; It was tough.&nbsp; I probably should have never left the photo lab.&nbsp; I like photography a lot.&nbsp; I enjoyed seeing things from around the world and back again.&nbsp; I also saw a lot of interesting things. hehehe.&nbsp; A lot of births. (I&nbsp;saw the whole birth of a baby from a girl who sat next to me in history class in high school).&nbsp; My first day I saw a dog smoking weed.&nbsp; There was the girl who's boyfriend was in jail and she would come in with rolls of lingerine shots and send them to him.&nbsp; I used to see her walk through the door and go right to her name.&nbsp; I think they got married.&nbsp; Then their were the regular commercial account people.&nbsp; Happy House (she was never very happy), Payne & Associates, Mr. Mahan (that man drove all the way from Ellijay just for me to do his pictures.. Deborah had run him off so many times, sure it was frustrating sometimes, but he helped my SALES!!!).&nbsp; Then their is Mr. Kling.&nbsp; I saw him yesterday when I paid a little visit to the old store.&nbsp; He jokes around so much.&nbsp; I told them that if you were having a bad day and he came in, even though most of the time what he says is really rude or mean, it would make you laugh.&nbsp; The first thing he said to me yesterday was "Wow, you need to go on a diet".&nbsp; It made me laugh!!   At Eckerd I worked at sooo many stores....&nbsp; Five Forks and Oak Road 2857, Five Forks and Rockbridge, Russell Rd and 20, Dahlonega, Gainesville, Centerville, Club Drive, Pleasant Hill and Old Norcross, Ronald Reagan and 124, 29 and Killian Hill, 29 and Sugarloaf, 120 and Riverside, Lawrenceville-Suwannee, 20 and Davis Rd, Dacula, and McDonough. Just counted up how many that was... 16.   Well anyway, my job... My boss was on vacation a few weeks ago and things got a little out of hand in the store.. We had people smoking weed behind the dumpter, 50 foot flames shooting across the store, the office desk catching on fire.&nbsp; I being an assistant manager should have put an end to everything really fast, but I was involved in setting things on fire and I knew about the weed and even got my brother in touch with one of the guys dealers.. UGH... What the hell was I thinking.&nbsp; I know that I wasn't thinking anyone would tell... Much less rat themselves out.&nbsp; And then photo lab boy goes and rat's out my brother...&nbsp; GRRRR I think that pisses me off more than loosing my job over this.   Well anyway Friday before going to Kenny Chesney it was dooms day for all of us involved.&nbsp; I could tell something was up... Too many phone calls, Amy comes in early, photo lab manager comes in early says "he is here for moral support", then Amy almost slips up and says Todd is coming... 5 min later he shows up then the DM Ken shows up.&nbsp; Then Matt had to go to the back, then Kevin, then me, and Sarah....&nbsp; They told me I could work Saturday but that HR had to make the final decision.&nbsp; Well I pretty much knew I would be fired... I had gotten busted in a Sting operation by the cops at one of the stores I was at. Selling Alcohol to a minor.&nbsp; I was told I couldn't get in any more trouble.&nbsp; The store I was sent to is known for people being fired.&nbsp; I thought that was originally why they sent me there.&nbsp; Which still could be true.&nbsp; Amy and I didn't have the best working relationship.&nbsp; She was constantly bitching at me for something... Most of the time my personal business.   I had talked to Amy Sunday to tell her that if I wasn't fired I would be stepping down.&nbsp; I also told her I didn't plan on attending two classes this week and that I would work concerts instead.&nbsp; She told me to give her a call before coming in because they had told her the decision would be made on Monday.&nbsp; Well I was planning on going in at 12:30 anyway because I wanted to leave early Tuesday so that I wouldn't be late to work the Dave Matthews concert... I was at Wal-Mart with Lizabeth and her siblings and I guess I didn't have service.. Probably not a bad thing.&nbsp; I go to McDonald's and my phone beeps like I have a TM.&nbsp; I thought it might be Sarah, but it's a Voice Mail.&nbsp; I listen to it and it's Amy telling me to give her a call back and that she would be going to the bank and would be back in 20 min... Well I decided to eat since I wasn't sure if I would want to eat later and then head up to Eckerd and get the face to face decision and if necessary turn in the keys.&nbsp;   I got to Eckerd and Amy wasn't there yet so I had a cigarette, (bad habit that has started recently and I don't plan on continuing long term... I hope)... Amy drives up kinda shakes her head.&nbsp; I walk over to her vehicle and she is like "You were supposed to call me", I was like "Well I was at Wal-Mart and didn't have service and was going to come in early anyway." So she kinda acts a little funny for a little bit and finally I say "Just tell me, I know it can't be good" She says in a cracking voice "I don't have any employees".&nbsp; It felt good, but at the same time I didn't want to leave Eckerd this way.&nbsp; We talked a little bit... I think she was trying to make sure I was ok, which I still am not sure if I am or not, and then we went inside for the ceremonial turning in of the keys...&nbsp; She told me that Matt was smoking up when she told him he was fired, Kevin had called back while she was gone so she called him and let him know... For whatever reason I think he had to tell his High School Sports coaches what is going on.&nbsp; I don't know what Sarah said, and Feda ugh he is probably going to get a Lawyer and then drag us all down with him... My brother...&nbsp; I don't know... He doesn't work till Thursday but he said they were trying to get him to come in yesterday which he had thought was extremely strange.&nbsp; I think he plans on going up to talk to them at some point today.   I have concerts to work everyday till Sunday.&nbsp; I thought I had a bunch next week too, but those all were cancelled.. I plan on filing for unemployment at some point, and beginning my job search very soon... But I do have a few leads that I can pursue.&nbsp; I've thought about taking time off and maybe heading up North to visit my grandmother, or possibly talking to my grandmother about going overseas... Since now would be an opportunity...&nbsp; I don't know tho.&nbsp; I can't live forever without money and I don't plan on moving home.   Well I will type more later...&nbsp; It's time to do something!

      A hundred days have made me older, since the last time that I saw your pretty face  A thousand lies have made me colder and I don’t think I can look at this the same  But all the miles that separate  They disappear now when I’m dreaming of your face   I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time  I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight, there’s only you and me   The miles just keep rolling as the people leave their way to say hello  I've heard this life is overrated but I hope that this gets better as we go   I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time  I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight girl, there’s only you and me   Everything I know, and anywhere I go it gets hard but it won’t take away my love  And when the last one falls, when it’s all said and done  it gets hard but it won’t take away my love   I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time  I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight girl, there’s only you and me   I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time  I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams  but tonight girl, there’s only you and me

      Saturday, July 24th was a night of another concert.&nbsp; This time I was working.&nbsp; I had seen Nickelback earlier this year at The Gwinnett Arena, so I knew what to expect from them.&nbsp; A good show.&nbsp; As for the other bands.. I wasn't so sure what to expect.&nbsp; I wasn't as excited about this show as Kenny at all.&nbsp; I had to be at work at 8a.m. after going to sleep around 3.&nbsp; The day went by quickly, but then the time Chris and I got to HiFi Buys dragged until the show started.&nbsp; Chris was hitting on some High School girl which totally disgusted me.&nbsp; He talks so much and I feel retarded when I am around him at times.&nbsp; So I talked with Darrell and Mark and Mark has someone who is quitting to head back to school in Mid August so I might work with him for a while.&nbsp; He does landscaping and that might be an interesting change for me and might actually get me going in a right direction.&nbsp;   Anyway, it was another hot night in Atlanta.&nbsp; I plunged my head into the garbage pale full of ice water and our bottled water to cool off.&nbsp; The coolness only lasted about 5 minutes...&nbsp; Once the show started it was still hot.&nbsp; The crowd was very calm.&nbsp; Which was really good.&nbsp; We didn't need to be dealing with a whole bunch of nastiness.&nbsp; Chris and I did have to deal with 2 nasty fat bitches all night long. They constantly wanted something from the stage or a guitar pic or this or that.&nbsp; I knew right away they were going to annoy the crap out of me, so I tried to ignore them as much as possible.&nbsp; One of them kept on staring at me for whatever her reasons were.&nbsp; She even moved from her spot to try and get in front of me and stare at me some more.&nbsp; I think she just wanted my stupid pic.&nbsp; Chris had given them a few things and they still didn't shut up so I knew that it was time to block them out the rest of the night.&nbsp; I would walk by and keep on going.&nbsp; I didn't want to deal with it.&nbsp; And I didn't.&nbsp; I think after the show was over one of them had to be escorted out of the pit because she wouldn't leave. UGH!!!!!   Puddle of Mudd was good, they finished their set with She Hates Me!!&nbsp; Nickelback came next, all the pit guys got set lists for Nickelback and 3 Doors Down because they use so much Pyro.&nbsp; We had to be ready for it.&nbsp; I knew Nickelback used a bunch from Gwinnett.&nbsp; I think there was 16 songs between the two of them that we had some kind of pyro.&nbsp; Towards the end of the Nickelback set they ended up spraying everyone up front with BEER!!!&nbsp; It was kinda gross.&nbsp; Gotta love How You Remind Me, Too Bad, Hero, and Someday... 3 Doors Down was good.&nbsp; I might have seen them before but I really can't remember.&nbsp; But gotta love Kryptonite, Here Without You and Loser.. The first song they sang a&nbsp;pic landed on Chris' head and as he looked at it later he noticed the signature on it looked like his.&nbsp; He showed this to quite a few people.&nbsp; When we were leaving I saw one of the photographers that was photographing during the night.&nbsp; We started talking to him and found out that he knows the members of 3 doors down... So Chris shows him the pic and the guy is like, Yeah that is Chris Henderson... Chris was like wow, I was like that's Chris Henderson.&nbsp; Sooo he was going to take us backstage to meet him, but him and his wife needed some "fixing problem time".. Poor guy.&nbsp;   The photographer guy showed us a picture he just had to take... There is a gas station chain somewhere in the Midwest named Kum and Go.&nbsp; It was a good laugh.

      Despite Friday being probably one of the worst days for me at work ever, which I will get into after the investigation is over and I figure out if I have a job or not, things kinda got a little crazy before we hit the road.   I left work a little later than I had wanted to do to being "questioned" so Sarah calls me and informs me that Her and Carl are on the way to the apartment.&nbsp; Cool, I was just a little ways behind them... I had tried calling Lizabeth because I wanted to tell her what had been going on and that I was on my way, but she wasn't answering the phone... Kinda really frustrating!!!&nbsp; So Sarah and Carl get to my apartment and they knock a few times.. No Answer, I told them to try the door, it's locked... No big deal you say.&nbsp; Well Lizabeth has my key sooo if the door is still locked when I get there, I can't even get in.. But I ask if Andrews van is in the parking lot, which it is, he had gotten off work way early.&nbsp; Soo I finally pull into the parking lot and all the anger, and frustrations come out as I just want to get inside and change my cloths and load up the van so that when Chris gets here we can get on the road, he won't be late, and we can all get the party started...&nbsp; So I take off in a full sprint from the van all the way up the stairs to the door.&nbsp; I wasn't messing around I pounded on that door 3 times.. HARD, I think I dented the door.. I was trying to calm myself because I seriously wanted to kick the door in.&nbsp; Finally after I'd say another 10 min Lizabeth answers the door in a towel...&nbsp; I finally get in a change and Chris shows up.&nbsp; And we should be hitting the road instead we still have to load everything in the van still... UGH.&nbsp; I did speak to Andrew about how pissed I was on Saturday, cause it did make Chris late.   Once we got on the road, I still wasn't very happy.&nbsp; Listening to Chris just can drive someone insane, Carl was riding shotgun, Chris was in a captain chair, and the girls (Sarah and Lizabeth) were in the way back of the van.&nbsp; We got some McDonald's and then came the traffic, in a spot where I knew Chris was going to be late.&nbsp; It's sad that I know where traffic starts and if it starts before that point your screwed.&nbsp;   We finally get to HiFi Buys amphitheater!!&nbsp; We dump Chris off.&nbsp; THANK GOD before anyone just opened the door and threw him out on the side of the road.&nbsp; Believe me I thought about it a few times!!&nbsp; We find a great place to park and it's time to PARTY!!!&nbsp; We had a cooler full of beer, Margaritas, 3 different flavors of Coke, Rum, bread, and sandwich stuff...&nbsp; I went to Will Call to get out Tickets but they didn't have anything yet.&nbsp; That was weird because I thought will call was open all day the day of a show.&nbsp; OH well.&nbsp; So I get back and I am drinking and Lizabeth tells me that she thinks Alexis is sitting on the back of a truck like 3 spaces over from us.&nbsp; I look over. I thought it was her too.&nbsp; After a&nbsp;few moments of "why is this day so bad" I realize that Alexis has grown out her hair again (Well the last time I saw her it was), She had told me that Nick never got her tickets and he works at Publix (ticketmaster center is right by his office), and she had told me the last time I talked to her that they were going to Brooks and Dunn, Montgomery Gentry, and Gretchen Wilson in October.&nbsp; So with that over with it was time to party down again.&nbsp;   I think Carls main objective was to 1) get the girls drunk so that they would do stuff. 2)get himself drunk. 3)Enjoy Rascal Flatts.&nbsp; He got himself tipsy drunk, had to cut him off.&nbsp; He wasn't comfortable with pissing in the woods for some reason.&nbsp; He said too many people were around.&nbsp; I was thinking hell, I've pissed in the middle of the Stone Mountain Wal-Mart at 1a.m. in front of a bunch of Mexicans because the store was 24 hours, but that night it was closed.&nbsp; I also peed in a Marta Parking lot.&nbsp; OH well.&nbsp; Lizabeth and Sarah didn't get too drunk.&nbsp; I didn't either, I wanted to remember and enjoy the show.&nbsp; The girls did grab on each other a little bit.&nbsp; Carl was begging me to let them kiss. (because I had put rules down that they couldn't do anything).&nbsp; I told them we could 3-way kiss, but didn't happen.&nbsp; It's all good.&nbsp; Lizabeth didn't want Andrew to find out.. I asked him if he would have cared.. NOPE!!!&nbsp;   ON the Inside...&nbsp; I think at HiFi Buys Amphitheater the only other time I had tickets in the 100 section were for DC Talk (Christian Band).&nbsp; But If it weren't for Sarah we wouldn't have had these seats, cause I had the link for the Pre-Sale and the time it started I was at work.&nbsp; We get to our seats.&nbsp; Awesome. Their not front row Section 103, row T, but I work at HiFi Buys so I can get up&nbsp;there. hhehehehe.&nbsp; &nbsp; Uncle Kracker performs.&nbsp; I'd seen him a few years ago at centennial Olympic Park when his first single I Believe came out.&nbsp; He did a good job.&nbsp; Next to the Stage Rascal Flatts.&nbsp; I had seen them with Toby Keith 2 years ago, but I was working and in the 200 section so it wasn't much fun.&nbsp; "I miss Mayberry Sitting on the porch drinking Ice cold Cherry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coke Where everything is black and white".&nbsp; "I've dealt with my ghosts and faced all my demons Finally content with a past I regret I ve found you find strength in your moments of weakness For once Im at peace with myself Ive been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long Im movin on". "I'm gonna stand on a rooftop Climb up a mountaintop Baby, scream and shout I wanna sing it on the radio Show it on a video Baby, leave no doubt I want the whole world to know Just what I'm all about I&nbsp;love to love you out loud". Then....   The Moment we have all been waiting for the last 3 months... OK!! Mr. Lenny Chetney.. WHAT?Mr. Lenny Chetney.. WHAT?&nbsp; MR. KENNY CHESNEY... YEAH!!!!!!!&nbsp; I had gotten some info the other day that he would start with Young and then Live Those Songs!!&nbsp; YUP!!&nbsp; Sure did.&nbsp; GRR internet explorer crashed and I had only saved it to this point.&nbsp; That really pisses me off.&nbsp; OH well.&nbsp; I read some reviews on Kenny's Forum for the KCOFC, one person described Kenny as the best entertainer since Garth Brooks... ENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR BABY!!!&nbsp; I had so much fun.&nbsp; Took tons of pictures and some video clips.&nbsp; Maybe I can convert some of those clips to pictures as well.&nbsp; "I picked myself up off the floor She walked back through the door And we made love like it was the first time". "To this day I still taste that first kiss How I prayed it wouldn`t end In a way, seeing you like this I guess it never really did".&nbsp;"Ordinary no, really don`t think so Not a love this true Common destiny We were meant to be Me and you". "Paint your name on a water tank Or miscount all the beers you drank Back where I come from".&nbsp; "Shes got every quality From A all the way to Z Its easy to see shes the perfect girl". "&nbsp;wanna know how forever feels". "There`s a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep". "We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue With our Rock n' roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes". He walked up and said "What'll it be?"I said,''The good stuff"He didn't reach around for the whiskeyHe didn't pour me a beerHis blue eyes kind of went mistyHe said, "You can't find that here."".&nbsp; "No boss, no clock, no stress, no dress code". "All he could see were his dreams goin' up in smoke.So much for ditchin' this town and hangin' out on the coast.Oh well, those plans are long gone.". "I used to rock all night to "Keep On Rockin Me Baby"Frat parties, college bars, just tryin to impress the ladiesI heard it today and I couldn't help but sing alongCause everytime I hear that song....". "All day long just takin it easyLayin in the hammock where it's nice and breezySleepin off the night beforeCause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more".&nbsp; ahhhh what a night...&nbsp; I had gone up front a few times to get some pictures closer to the stage.&nbsp; The messed up thing is that when I am working a show I hate the people who come from the back and do what I was doing... OH WELL!!!&nbsp; I wasn't working up front and I wasn't going to stop myself.&nbsp; Since they were starting to let people get up front I went back and brought Sarah up front.&nbsp; Probably pissed Lizabeth and Carl off, but I know how much of a Kenny fan Sarah is!!&nbsp; I hope that everyone had a great time.&nbsp; I know I sure did!!!

      WOW, it has finally arrived.&nbsp; The day of the Kenny Chesney concert.&nbsp; Tonight is going to be like Christmas.&nbsp; It is almost 1a.m. I have to get up at 6 or so to be at work at 7.. UGH.&nbsp;  I get home from dinner with Sarah and Lizabeth and my brother, little Matt, Ben and Andrew are making stupid videos.&nbsp; They try to get me to do something stupid, but I am pissed off cause I couldn't find an adapter for the car so we can watch DVD's while drinkin it up before the show...&nbsp; I did find one online at Best Buy so we might just stop there before we go... We will see.&nbsp; Anyway I hear something about them wanting to stick Bens dick in the vacuum hose and turn it on... Now I wonder if they are all gay... Well anyway. Ben goes into the bathroom and tapes up his dick and then walks around with it all hanging out and shit... I am so disturbed right now...&nbsp;   Joes Crap Shack... I don't like Sea Food but I guess I shouldn't complain because we did get a discount, but the service was really shitty.&nbsp; It has been that way for a while.&nbsp; Even when Lizabeth is there.&nbsp; But oh well.&nbsp; It was also freezing cold.&nbsp; EVEN for me.&nbsp; I felt bad for the girls cause they both were cold.&nbsp; Too bad I had the van I had a jacket in the trunk of my car.&nbsp; and probably a shirt or something.&nbsp; "Would you like the twin breasts?, Hell I see quadruplets right here."   This is going to be a fun day, and I know Saturday we are all going to be super tired and hung over.&nbsp; I feel bad that Sarah has to drive back to Milledgeville and work, but I have to work too... TWO jobs. I work at 8a.m. till 3 at Eckerd and then work Nickelback/3 Doors down.&nbsp; I have about an hour and a&nbsp; half to get down to the amphitheater..&nbsp; And then I will work till probably 11:30 or 12.&nbsp; I am glad I asked for Sunday off... I was hoping to go to Six Flags, but I might just sleep all day.   I really hope that Sarah enjoys the Show.. esp since her and Kenny are getting married right afterwards!!&nbsp; hehe, When we get to the parking lot we all just need to let our stress run away for a little while.&nbsp; Carl has had a ton load of crap that I know has been bothering him, Lizabeth's parents are always on her about something, Sarah worrying about her family and the bills and the lake house, I had a stress free few days the beginning of the week, but it all came back as soon as I came home.&nbsp; It will be party time.&nbsp;   Well I better get some sleep.&nbsp; I am sure I will write more soon.

       ONE DAY TILL KENNY!!!!!&nbsp;     &nbsp; Wednesday July 21st was a day that started off cool and got strange really fast.&nbsp; It got strange when I got to work and then Amy makes some comment about knowing the Office Caught on Fire.&nbsp; Well hmmm, somehow I should have known she would find out about that... She has spies that tell her everything... Yet the people that i think would be the spies were also involved in another day of setting the office on fire.&nbsp; We really weren't setting it on fire... They would take alcohol and spray it and then watch it burn or blow it out.&nbsp; Nothing Serious until one guy somehow caught something in the desk on fire and I smelled it in the back of the store.&nbsp; The only people I think would tell on us are the Pharmacy staff.&nbsp; Which might be true.&nbsp; BUT I just hope she really didn't turn it in to anyone like I have been told she did.&nbsp; Guess I will have to wait and see.  After work I went to Joe's to Goes in Grayson... I love the food there.&nbsp; It kind of reminds me of the Robyn's Nest in Dahlonega.&nbsp; Only if this was Dahlonega I wouldn't have been eating there.&nbsp; Everything closes at 5p.m. up there.&nbsp; But Lizabeth joined me and so did Carl.&nbsp; Lately Lizabeth has been getting on my nerves like CRAZY.&nbsp; She loves Andrew to death, but he could care less.&nbsp; She&nbsp;asks me one day that if she is single when she turns 26 if I will Marry her... I said yes but I was being nice.&nbsp; She knows alot of guys that would love to be in her life I think (Trey, Grant, Robbie, ect.)&nbsp; Monica and Aaron are planning on getting married in 8 months.&nbsp; Which is cool for them.&nbsp; Lizabeth is going to be in their wedding.&nbsp; She is stressing out on the planning that only began 2 days ago, and is already stressing on who will be her date.&nbsp; GOOD GOD, I told her that I will worry about a date 2 weeks before... which is kinda a lie.. I might wait till the day before.&nbsp;   Intresting I am starting to get really tired, but I noticed little shortcut things here at the bottom of the screen where the typing box is...&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes my mind wanders like this alot.&nbsp; Some days I wonder if I should be driving... Today was one of those days.&nbsp; I don't know how I made it to work, just alot of things on my mind.  Carl came up to Joes to Goes too...&nbsp; I think he had fun... We played football in the parking lot for a good 30 minutes.&nbsp; Some chineese guys came out and watched us for a little while... One of them might have been gay he kept playing with himself.&nbsp; AHHHH NASTY.... Then I decided to change out of my work cloths and Lizabeth kept trying to pants me as cars were driving by.&nbsp; I think some people might have gotten a nice peek at my ass.&nbsp; Carl and I had a good talk after Lizabeth left... Mainly about life and how things are going with him... Lately he has been meeting girls left and right and talking to many of them...&nbsp; We were on the subject of how we were in high school and stuff.&nbsp; He said he had been picked on alot in Elementary School and Middle School and was kinda just there in High School..&nbsp; For me things were cool until we moved down here, then my brother and I were the outcasts.&nbsp; We were made fun of constantly in Elementary School.&nbsp; and for me it continued till my Freshman year in HS, for my brother it died as soon as he got to middle school.&nbsp; But in High School I was kind of a jock, but a dork at the same time.&nbsp; I didn't hang out with the "cool" people, but I had my set of friends and I had my group with the Track Team.&nbsp; We would do the random stupid stuff and treat people like shit.&nbsp; (Pulling my pants down in a parking lot at a hotel in Florida and singing opera style for money as the bus driver comes around the bus, Dating a freshman for 1 hour when I was a senior, Shamu, Getting Erik kicked out of school because we didn't like him.. poor guy never did anything bad that day. but get a group of people together and write a report wow they get kicked out fast!!, Psycho Tina, damn you become her friend and you go through some shit to not be her friend, never date someone you work with!!, Breaking up with someone the day after valentines day to get motivation to run better.., then get back together and cheat on her... Kathy, hmm that breakup went well, she has slept with over 30+ ppl is now married and has a kid, and probably still has feelings for me...) anyway I don't even know why I started this paragraph and I am too lazy to go back a read it again...  OH GOD THIS IS FUNNY stealrain22: what kind of tires are they ck2man97: I don't know off top of my head stealrain22: there ain't much on the top of your now anyways stealrain22: just stubble ck2man97: lol  Anyway it is getting close to 2:30 a.m. I should probably go to bed since I plan on going to six flags in the morning, but Chris and I are having fun bashing the shit out of people!!! LOL stealrain22: i don't like her much either stealrain22: she talks alot of talk but she never walks the walk ck2man97: no shit ck2man97: she talks it all, but then Mommy is like come home now ck2man97: that girl will never make it on her own  I am going to hell!!!&nbsp; muuuhhaaahahahahaha  OK for real now, I am about to head to bed.&nbsp;

      I come home from work and it's like dog pile at the front door...&nbsp; Little matt opens the door because it is locked and my brother had come to Eckerd to get the key from me so that he could get in earlier... He tells me he has no idea where my key is at.&nbsp; So I have to yell at everyone until they decide to find my key...&nbsp; And they used my digital camera without my permission.&nbsp;   Roomate Matt proceeds to tell me that my brother didn't turn anything in my room off last night.&nbsp; So my ps2, vcr, tv and ceiling lights were on all night long.&nbsp; GRRR...&nbsp; Also ALL OF MY OREO's had been eaten once again.&nbsp; When I came home from work there were some Oreo's on the counter, but they must have been roomate Matt's because they disappeared right after I had seen them.&nbsp; He told me he had eaten some of mine too!!!&nbsp;   Amy, my boss, told me that I need to go to A.A.&nbsp; she thinks that I have a drinking problem.&nbsp; I think my roomate Andrew has&nbsp; a drinking problem.&nbsp; He's the one who comes home from work and in less than 4 minutes is poping open a beer of some kind.&nbsp; I will admit at one time I had a drinking problem, and in June I could have had another drinking problem.... I drank a whole lot last month.. This month it is really hard for me to even look at a beer.&nbsp; Tonight was the slowest night ever at work.. The last two hours seemed to take a week... It should be friday already!!&nbsp;   I am so sick of the drama at my&nbsp;Eckerd, dealing with Eckerd and I hate traffic... I told the Sarah that I work with that if I wanted to screw over all my roomates I'd move down to Milledgeville.&nbsp; Only the only problem would be where to find a job.&nbsp; Oh well, I can't screw these guys over, then I would be stepping down a level and could be compared to Austin or some other people I have lived with in the past.  &nbsp;

      Well I am back to Lawrenceville...&nbsp; I had a nice break away for a few days down in Milledgeville.&nbsp; I am starting to see why Sarah likes it there so much.&nbsp; It's kind of like Dahlonega but it has way more fun things to do.&nbsp; It makes me wonder why I never tried to go to College there.&nbsp; OH well..&nbsp; I think I got sunburn on the way home.&nbsp; It feels like my face is still frying.&nbsp; Which means the top of my head must be fried too.  &nbsp;  Lets see on the way down to Milledgeville it rained.. Not as hard as it has in the past, but it rained.&nbsp; Then, Jessica calls me and gets upset with me that I never come to see her... Well I really don't know her all that well and I don't know that a 26 year old should be messing around with someone who is 17.&nbsp; It kinda goes back to when I was working at Winn Dixie and the meat man was dating a girl who was a sophomore in high school and he was like 28....&nbsp; Anyway she somehow thought that I went by her house on the way to Millegeville and got really upset with me and I think started crying but I missed both driveways to the lake house and that kinda made me a little mad.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Overall it was a much better trip this time mainly because Chris wasn't there to get in a bad mood or cause tension between everyone knowing that Sarah doesn't like him too much or that he will talk way too much and annoy the hell out of everyone.&nbsp; But for whatever reason I ended up getting sick.. Only once but, once is enough.&nbsp; I felt really bad because I wasn't feeling so well and just hung out on the streets of downtown milledgeville.&nbsp; It was probably better that I did that just cause when your not feeling so good, loud noises, or music, or too hot or too cold can make it worse and I wasn't sure if I was gonna be sick or if it would just pass.&nbsp; But then I had this cop pull up behind me while I was sitting there and that kinda made me feel uneasy so I went to find Ro, Liz and the friend... Soon after we went home.. everyone that came over chilled and had fun and I went to sleep.&nbsp; I HATE NOT FEELING GOOD.&nbsp; Cause it would have been fun to hang out with everyone.&nbsp; Maybe next time.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Only 3 more days till Mr. Kenny Chesney comes to town.&nbsp; I can't wait.&nbsp; It's gonna be a blast.&nbsp; I was listening to his music all the way home.&nbsp; It's like the refresher course so that you recognized everything that can be played...&nbsp; Last year he played every song on his Greatest Hits album.. even though most of them were mixed together into quick little bits.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well I better shower and prepare for work.&nbsp; Maybe I will write more later.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Random funny things:  &nbsp;  The big fart... luckily Sarah never herd it  "Pyscho 29 year old twin boy"  "You seem familiar to me"  "Would you like to switch sides of the bed?"&nbsp; "No I think I will be alright."  Wake up... oh damn I am not alright.  Boston and Sarah playing, I look away for a second, Look back "OOPS" Priceless face of huh, I see boob.&nbsp;  I think Rocko is eating cat shit...  How many times a day does that dog shit? Last time it puked all the time..  "Did Sarah knock&nbsp;you up?" "I didn't know&nbsp;she wore those." How many people did we fit in the car? I think I remember people buying beer after midnight... I must have looked retarded buying&nbsp;a water and Pepto.. I think I&nbsp;started chugging the bottle of pepto. "Where is the housing office?"  &nbsp;

      Wow, it's really been a long week.. Something has changed on this screen.&nbsp; It has a different font and format that I am used to...&nbsp; I guess it's the progress of the world and things that work in it... &nbsp; Amy's been on vacation this week, so I've been the main person in charge.&nbsp; Nothing really has happened this week.&nbsp; Just that the lists have been really short and they are completed way too early in the day and then it's boring for the next 8 or 9 hours.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I am not sure what's going on with Lizabeth right now... She wanted me to call Linslut 1 and tell her what I knew so that she could spill it to her.&nbsp; I was like FUCK THAT I will just tell you.&nbsp; So tonight she goes over to Robbies place.&nbsp; Robbie is a cool guy (mainly because of his connections at Wild Bills.. Bill Gentry), but I wouldn't trust him for some reason.&nbsp; But she went over to his place tonight.... She was asking me about Hickies and I didn't see any but who knows what is going on with that... &nbsp; Lizabeth was also acting weird about me going to Milledgeville this Sunday.&nbsp; I don't know why or understand why.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It's less than a week to the Kenny Chesney concert.&nbsp; I have been this excited to be actually going to see a show like this in a while... Working concerts all the time kind of ruins some stuff for you, but after working last years show I am very pumped up for this one.&nbsp; I was pissed at myself for working last years.&nbsp; Cause you really can't see what's going on on the stage.&nbsp; Of course the crowd at a country show isn't usually that bad....&nbsp; Except for the really big people that are gross.&nbsp; BLAHHH&nbsp; This should be my 4th or 5th Kenny show.&nbsp; Lets see Hiawassee, Tim and Kenny, Last year....&nbsp;  &nbsp; I have more to type, but I think I need to be sleeping..&nbsp; I just finished reading a blogg at 1:15a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; HEHE i finished before 2.&nbsp; It was intresting to read the perspectives on things according to someone else.&nbsp; Sarah has told me alot about her life and things that go on and alot of the things I read I have been told by her, other things I had no clue about or knew about but now see things in a different light..&nbsp; It was like watching someone grow up in a way...&nbsp; The emotions of letting someone go that will always hold a piece of your heart.&nbsp; The hurt of knowing that the one person you loved the most is happier with someone else.&nbsp; Not knowing what was actually going on but having a feeling that things were ok when the weren't.&nbsp; The rollercoaster of every day life.&nbsp; Each and every day is a learning process that helps us better prepare for the future.&nbsp; Most day aren't Routine.&nbsp; Changes occur and sometimes your just left standing there wondering why.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Well it is closing towards 2a.m. so I am seriously going to bed. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      My Worst Fear (Anthony Smith/Al Anderson)  Last night you gave me a kiss You didn't know it, but I was awake when you did You were quiet, you were gonna let me sleep So I just laid there pretending to be You said some things you didn't  Know I could hear And the words "I love you" never  Sounded so sincere  It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving Now that I know just how much you care You finally gave me one good reason not to go But staying here is my worst fear  This morning I rolled out of bed Recalling all the sweet things you said This was the day I was gonna hurt you bad Called out your name, but you Didn't answer back I searched the house to find out what was wrong Like a ton of bricks, it hit me you were gone  It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving Now that I know just how much you care You finally gave me one good reason not to go But staying here is my worst fear  All along I knew that there was  Something missing And only one thing left to do I had to leave behind this life that We'd been living But the only thing that left was you  It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving Now that I know just how much you care You finally gave me one good reason not to go But being alone is my worst fear And staying here is my worst fear

      Everywhere (Craig Wiseman/Mike Reid)  We were born in this little town Growin' up I was countin' down Every single day till we made our get-away But you said you could never see yourself Trying to make a life anywhere else This would be your home And I was on my own But ever since you said good-bye I've been out here on the wind And baby you would be surprised All the places you have been  I've seen you in Albuquerque waitin' out a blizzard Arizona dancin' 'cross the desert Watchin' the sun set in Monterey Girl I swear just the other day you were Down in Georgia pickin' them peaches Carolina barefoot on the beaches No matter where you choose to be In my heart I'll always see you Everywhere  Now a days when I'm passin' through The conversation always turns to you I hear you're doin' fine Livin' out by the county line Got a man that's home every night A couple of kids and the kind of life That you want to leave Guess you could say the same for me But you and I made our choices All those years ago Still I know I'll hear your voice And see you down the road Maybe in  Oklahoma drivin' 'cross the prairie In Dallas Texas isn't that where we Always said we would like to try But never did so maybe that's why You're on every highway just beyond the high-beams Right beside me in all of my sweet dreams No matter where you choose to be In my heart I'll always see you In..  Albuquerque waitin' out a blizzard Arizona dancin' 'cross the desert Watchin' the sun set in Monterey Girl I swear just the other day you were Down in Georgia pickin' them peaches Carolina barefoot on the beaches No matter where you choose to be In my heart I'll always see you Everywhere

      Sunday's my family goes to my grandmothers house to eat a lunch/dinner type thing... I don't go all that often anymore. 1)because I work every other Sunday, 2)because they always seem to find some way to yell at me about something, 3)my brother doesn't bother going anymore either.  So today I get the usual lecture about my brother and needing to talk to him, which I talk to him every time and he doesn't care.  So whatever...    But today as I am leaving my grandmother asks me "Still no girlfriend?" My reply "Nope.", but then while putting on my sandal's I thought about being a smartass since I do have many friends that are girls.. So I said "I take that back, I do have many girlfriends, I just don't have a Girlfriend." Her reply is "Oh so you just haven't found someone that turns you on." At that point I just shook my head and headed out the door.  That statement coming from my grandmother, was just a little bit off.

      Everyone who knows Chris, knows what I am talking about when you hear stuff like this probably each and everytime you see him. "This on time in Japan..." "One time when I was drunk...." "This on time when I was high..." "I spent my 21st birthday on a float up in NYC..." "One time I got pulled over..." "If I get pulled over again in Lawrenceville I will go to jail." "I almost beat up a homeless guy" "I drank enough to put you in an alcoholic coma" "The cop tried to arrest me for a DUI and I wasn't even drunk." "The cop asked me if I had been smoking Marijuana." "I don't tell you how it was or how it should be, I tell you like it is." "Damn she was fine." "I got this girls number" "She won't return any of my phone calls" "I got in race with this one guy..." "I've changed alot" "Have you ever been to Japan?" "I hate my job." "I am going to quit my job" "When I win the lottery..." "I got a song for you..." "I quit doing drugs" "Look at all my double matches" "Look at my score." "What would you do if it was just me and you?"  These are just a few.. Maybe on another night I can't sleep I will add more.

      Today has been the slackest friday I have had in a very long time.  Maybe it was because Amy's vacation began at 2p.m. today... Maybe because our truck wasn't very big at all.  But for the second friday in a row we had a visit from the district staff.  Both visits went very well.  They both said that the store looked very good.  I also found out that I can continue doing the concert security as long as I don't abuse my co-workers in the process.  So I think that is a good thing, but I think that I need to find another job anyway.  Especially since I don't want to end up being a Store Manager.  If that happens I think I will end up being single and miserable for the rest of my life.  Roomate matt will probably be single for the rest of his life as well.  Somehow Chris would probably be the one that gets married before any of us.  You never know it could happen!!    I could seriously fall asleep right now and not wake up until sometime tomorrow...  I always say that I am going to nap when I get off work, but I somehow end up staying up till 1a.m. or later.  Occasionaly I will be in bed before midnight...

      First off before I go into a my story, I have go to apologize to Sarah, Ro, and Liz...  I should have known that bringing Chris down would not have been the best of choices, but everyday is a learning experience and I am sorry that we were all subjected to all that went on... I have also noticed, which others began to notice before me that Chris seems to have an obsessive compulsive thing going on.  Anyway I think that for me this trip to Milledgeville was so much fun and probably the best so far.  I felt bad that I wasn't drinking so much Wednesday night, but sometimes that happens.  Ever since the 10 beer funnel night I haven't drank too much.  Must be one of those phases.  I will admit going to a house party at whatever time in the morning was definitely not expected.  It was sort of a weird situation for me to be in, but it all turned out to be all good.  I haven't been to a house party like that since 2001.  A friend of mine at North Georgia lived at the "Party house" aka "Eric Jones' old house".  The cops usually had to bust them up from all the people being loud and the sound of beer bottles breaking a quarter mile down the road, and the drunk bastards yelling "waaahoooo".  Of course the terrain was a little awkward since we were up in the Mountains.  The driveway was super steep and people would always be stumbling up or down and then the backyard was always wet and smelled funny...    Anyway, Rocco puking was exciting, and Chris sleeping in his car.. Can't really figure that one out.  He also had said he thought about coming in getting me and just leaving without saying a word...  I also don't understand how on the way home he would say that he wasn't going to Stone Mountain unless Ro or Sarah invited him and that he didn't plan on talking to them again unless they attempted to talk to him first.  Which quickly didn't happen.    gotta love: "Save a horse, ride a cowboy" "Have you ever been to Japan before" "and again" "My weakness is talking too much" "(Wendys bathroom smells like ass, Chris wets his face and hair) Wants to go into the lobby and yell.. wooo don't go in there" "watch out for that ditch" "Railroad tracks" "Lenny Chesney" "That's the first time this year I have been over 100mph" "Why are there 3 guys sitting in a car with the windows rolled up" "It's my mother fucking birthday"

      Artist: Tim McGraw  Album: Live Like You Were Dying [Single]  Song: Live Like You Were Dying  Lyrics:   He said I was in my early forties  with a lot of life before me  when a moment came that stopped me on a dime  and I spent most of the next days looking at the x-rays  Talking bout the options  and talking bout sweet time I asked him when it sank in  that this might really be the real end  how's it hit you when you get that kinda news  man what'd you do   and he said I went sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying.  He said I was finally the husband  that most the time I wasn't  and I became a friend a friend would like to have  and all the sudden going fishin  wasn't such an imposition  and I went three times that year I lost my dad  well I finally read the good book  and I took a good long hard look  at what I'd do if I could do it all again   and then  I went sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying.  Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about  what'd you do with it what did you do with it  what did I do with it  what would I do with it'   Sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and then I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I watched an eagle as it was flying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying. To live like you were dying  To live like you were dying To live like you were dying  To live like you were dying

      Each summer families, teenagers, lovers, loners, and friends head for a vacation spot somewhere.. Somewhere to get away from the rushing, working, and dealing of everyday life.  Some golf, some head for the mountains, some head for the beaches, some visit family, some visit friends, we all end up somewhere hopefully peacefull.  The mountains are a place where you can see miles and miles away.  You can see the trees bursting from the hills across the valley, you see mountain streams,waterfalls, and lakes.  The air is thin, the roads are curvy.  The people can be friendly or they can scare the crap out of you.  Take a deep breath and feel the coolness the freshness of the air.  The beach is a place of sand, breezes, waves and salty air.  You see all kinds of people all around.  Fat, small, young, old, the dude that is so sunburn he looks like a lobster.  During the day everyone is out to get some sun, water, and fun.  You ride the waves, swim around with fishes in the sea.  Check the local restaurants for the best food you've tasted in a long time.  Buy souvienrs for your friends.  When the sun goes down people head for the streets.  People walking, people driving.  Everyone is having fun in their own way.  Head for the beach and a midnight stroll, feel the air constantly moving, hear the ocean rush towards the land and quickly retreat to deep sea.  Listen to the sounds for hours.  Wait for the sun to rise and see how god created the day.

      A long December and there's reason to believe Maybe this year will be better than the last I can't remember the last thing that you said  as you were leavin'  Now the days go by so fast And it's one more day up in the canyons And it's one more night in Hollywood If you think that I could be forgiven... I wish you would The smell of hospitals in winter And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters,  but no pearls All at once you look across a crowded room To see the way that light attaches to a girl And it's one more day up in the canyons And it's one more night in Hollywood If you think you might come to California... I think you should Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m. And talked a little while about the year I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower, Makes you talk a little lower  about the things you could not show her And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe Maybe this year will be better than the last  I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself To hold on to these moments as they pass And it's one more day up in the canyon And it's one more night in Hollywood It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...  I guess I should   Words & Music by Adam F. Duritz

      These are just the random things that are traveling through my head at this very moment....  Carl and Kym... Carl you have alot of things to start preparing for.  I don't know what will happen with the two of you, but right now it's not looking like Kym is going to stick with Carl, which is sad because Carl really wants to make this work.  He is very excited about that thought of being a Daddy.  But I hope he takes my advice and starts looking for a second job so that he can have some extra money to be able to support this new additon to the world.  It was a long long day at work, I spread my work out so that the day would go by faster and it sure did.  I am glad to be relaxing at the apartment!!!!  NEWS FLASH!!!! ROOMATE MATT is on a date.  WOW I am proud of him.  They had gone on a date right before she went to California to take some classes for her College work and she is back and we guess they are having a good time because he still isn't home and he likes to go to bed early.  What's going to become of Lizabeth and Andrew?  She needs to pull away before she gets hurt, but how does someone tell her this, when she has been told about 20 times already.  Alexis... STOP BEING A BITCH... Either be a friend of leave me the hell alone.  If the book needs to be closed then close it and don't ever open it again!!!  I have entered a "I don't give a shit" zone, I don't know if that is good or bad.  I have hurt people in this zone before and I tend to say some of the nastiest stuff, most of the time I don't mean it, but I know it hurts people.  I haven't felt this way in well over a year, maybe close to two years... It's kinda the asshole craig or Dahlonega Craig.  After I got out of my drinking thing a few years ago I vowed to never be this way again.  It's not as bad as it could be, but I don't know which way I am going to go with it, its something I can control but at the same time controls itself.  Very confusing.  I don't like the fact that it's already July, I like warm weather, going to the pool, and sunlight until 9p.m. at night... We are already setting school supplies at work, soon school will be in session and then Halloween will come, and then Thansgiving and Christmas.. AHHHHHH  I don't want it to be 2005 yet.  I just found out that Lizabeth is coming home in the morning.  I don't know if that is good or bad.

      Ahh July 4th.  The day started off kinda bad... I had gone to bed at 4a.m. and had to be at work at 9:30a.m. to learn some stupid stuff that I will have to do while Amy is on vacation...  I was planning on sleeping again when I got home from work, but since it is Chris' birthday I had to go buy him a present of some kind...  So Matt and I ended up going to Best Buy to get him a gift card and stopped at Sonics for lunch.  When we got back to the apartment Chris got off work and it was time to head over for the birthday bash... But instead of leaving Sean and I played Destruction Derby on the ps2.    Once we got over to Mrs. Henderson house we began to blow up fireworks like crazy... I had some saturn missiles that fell sideways and almost started firing towards us!!!  Not good.  We blew up some dog turds and some ant hills before the rains came...During the rain we continued to blow up stuff. The day wasn't so bad.  Good food, and lots of loud bangs, including when Chris almost blew up his hand... The short fuse went to fast and blew up just as he tossed it and it was so loud that we all lost hearing for a few minutes.  Matt and I left and headed over to the Mall of Georgia to see Tim Rushlow.  He used to be the lead singer of Little Texas before they broke up.  That was one of the best free concerts I have ever been to.  He covered a whole bunch of songs he did with Little Texas and a few others.  Then we took off and headed down the road as the fireworks began.  Which somewhat pissed me off because Matt doesn't want anything at all to do with fireworks.  But at the same time we didn't have to deal with any traffic. I finally used my digital camera and during one song my battery died. GRRR, but it's all good, I will be all ready for Kenny!!!  Now we are sitting around watching the video tape of the fireworks that were shot off at Mrs. Henderson house after Matt and I left.  Looked like fun!!

      Today was the first time in a long long time that Matt and I just went and did something random as hell.  We probably haven't done something like today since High School, but oh well we were board.  I wanted to see if I could find my old roommate from Dahlonega.  I know that at one point he told me he was working at some store at the outlet mall up in Dawsonville... So I called him and told him I might head that way and to give me a call and we could meet up.  Still no call at 3:15 a.m, but it's ok... he's probably out of town.    Anyway we went to the outlet mall and found a map and I tried to figure out where he would work, and it didn't work.. So we decided to head up to Dahlonega.  I went by all the old places I lived there.  Nothing really looks the same.  I went by the Eckerd and said hello to Cora.. She is still hanging as the lab manager, but Tim and Debbie are no longer at that store.. Tim was the store manager for years there and he quit because of Dennis Mack... They never got along and then for whatever reason Debbie got transferred to Cumming.    After Eckerd we kind of just road around checking out random things around town, we tried to stop down at Camp Glission to see a water fall but the sign said that the camp was closed to the public because a church group was there.... Well that isn't fair for them to keep everyone from seeing gods creations...  After riding around in Dahlonega we decided we were hungry and wanted to go to Gainesville to find a place to eat... Well I guess matt had to start his bull crap whining bull so we ended up coming back to Lawrenceville to eat... Kinda made a wrong turn in Gainesville and some dudes looked like they wanted to eat us for lunch... eeeks.  Now tonight didn't have anything planned until Sean got off work and we went over to Ulyss' house out in Bethlehem.. Well we brought 3 bags full of fireworks over there.  We were having a great time blowing up everything...  We had a crap ton load of stuff going off and messing up the street.  Sean was looking down the road just as little matt throws a firework and yells.. It's a cop...  SO the Law shows up!!!  Barrow County's Finest!!!  He explains that he doesn't care about fireworks but it is against the law in GA and tells us that the only reason he is there is the someone filed a complaint... BOO HOO too much noise.  Well the cop was cool with us as we are all trying to find out which way to go.  Ulyss asks the cop if we can shoot of the last 3 biguns we had.. Cop says "sure".  They lined up 3,100 row firecrackers and blow the shit out of them... The cop writes he report and calls in to the station as this shit is flying everywhere... Mostly all over his car.  But he was cool with it and let it all go.. WHHEEWW  Then we got Sean puking again... We broke an egg in front of him and dumped it into a dish, then we put Ketchup on top of it, then added some chocolate pudding to it and mixed it up... he began gagging right away, but when we actually almost poured some into his mouth he lost all kinds of food!!!  it was so nasty I almost puked myself.    I must get some sleep now cause I gots to be at work at 9, and it's 3:30. Ugh

      Well it has been a few days since I made an entry and thank you Sarah for making me realize that...  I was just making a post and for whatever reason internet explorer just decided to shut down when I was doing spell check... DAMN THIS COMPUTER!!!!  Anyway, I should have made a few post prior to today cause now those things are gone.. GRRRR  OH well.    This should be a fun weekend, Chris turns 25 on Sunday, it won't be like last year.  No getting drunk at 2:30 a.m. and no Linda getting naked and puking all over and not cleaning it up...    I just uploaded and edited a bunch of pictures on my yahoo photo album..  http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/ck2man   urlLink    Check out the apartment, beach and concerts  Well I better shower and get ready for work... This day is going by fast!!!  I am very excited, cause its Friday and it's going to be a great weekend.  I kinda wish I didn't have a bunch to do up here, I would like to be either at the beach or down in Milledgeville parting, but I will be going to Milledgeville on Wed!!!

      I woke up kinda of early today.. I don't remember why.  Oh maybe it was Sarah's powers waking me up.  I wish I had those kind of powers.  People would be waking up all the time.. HEHHEEHEHEHEHHEEHE  Anyway, Matt and I went to the Checkered Parrot and ate some lunch and watched part of the Braves game.  We were commenting on how Chipper Jones is having a bad year and then he hits two home runs.  Well at least he did something to help the Braves out!!  Then we left and were going to stop at the Trade Center on Oakbrook Parkway and go to a train show, but it was probably $10 to get in and Matt only had 7 so we went to Publix on Pleasant Hill to see if Bill was there and see if they were hiring.  Bill told me to try at a different Publix and try to be trained to go to a new Publix that he should be the manager of off of McGinnis Ferry Rd or something like that.  So I might just try that out.   Then Chris came over and we headed down to Atlanta for the O.A.R concert.  Sarah and Lindsey tried to get me to head to Milledgeville instead, and if I hadn't paid 33 for my ticket to the show and if the ticket wasn't at Will Call I probably would have just gone down there instead, but I did enjoy the show once it got going.  It was different to be in a very crowded area with crowd surfers, and flashing, and fighting.  Well kinda I am usually on the other side of the baracade and helping people out.  I wanted to kick this lady out early who had pissed Chris and I off.  She forced her way between us to move closer to the stage. UGH, there wasn't any more room up closer.  We were all smashed I could barely move.  That lady ended up being kicked out for fighting with some girls.  We saw a few crowd surfers hit the ground hard.  But at least it wasn't a moshing show, but alot of people were smoking reefer...  UGH!!!   After the show was over I had a girl come and get a cig from me.  She gave me a big hug and a kiss.  WOW, I am glad I made that girls day.  Then Chris and I headed to waffle house for some grub, and then went over to Jon's house.  We just chilled and talked for a bit and now I am home and gettin ready to sleep... AHH sleep...  Random Quotes and sayings from today. "Are my panties showing" "Your wearing some" "I just saw peirced nipples" "That guy hit the ground hard" "This is an O.A.R show, I am here to see OAR" "If you give me a cigarette I will make out with you" "Come to Milledgeville, it will be so much more fun" "Tell Chris you have the funk" "I think someone shit themselves" "John Jacob Jingle himer schmit that's my name too, when ever we go out, the people always shout, JOHN JACOB JINGLE HIMER SCHMIT... Dahahahaddaada da da" "It's 3am and I wanna goto bed"

      The day started kinda weird, I had to pick up Lizabeth from Lindsey's Joes Crab Shack bc Lizabeth had spent the night at Lindsey's and for whatever reason she left her car here, and for whatever reason Lindsey couldn't drop her back off here to get her car.  I guess they got really drunk last night.  Fun for them, I didn't get drunk last night.  I wanted to, but when I got to Wild Bills I didn't feel like it for some reason.  It was a fast day.  I had to be down at HiFi Buys for Project Revolution at 3p.m. and I met up with Carl at Joes to Goes in Grayson for lunch and then went over and picked Aaron up and we carpooled down there.  Chris took himself and had a brain fart or something  and missed the exit we get off at.  He ended up late and got yelled at, he also did some stupid shit with a guitar pic and probably won't be working anymore shows.   It was an intresting night.  Less than Jake opened the show and much like the Linkin Park show at Phillips earlier this year it was very loud.  So I couldn't really hear much.  Then The Used came on.  Couldn't really hear much but the loud thumping of the bass.  Then Snoop Dog once again very loud.  Then Korn, wow, still couldn't hear.  Then Linkin Park, Yup still loud but at least I know all there songs.  THe mosh pit was nuts, blood, and hittin and fighting.  Glad I didn't mess with that.  It was all fun to watch.  Gotta make a decision about going to Milledgeville on Sunday.  Gotta make a decsion on pursuing Carls friend Ashley.   Well I am super tired so I better get some sleep.  But my head is pounding and I hear a ringing sound... UGH!!!

      I am sitting here trying to remember what I did today... Oh I guess I didn't do much of anything.  Went to the bank, Chris and I went to lunch, went by Eckerd to find out Feda is looking for where I live.  Not cool.  Dude is gonna find me with a Pelet gun pointed at his nuts.  Or he is gonna end up in jail.  Maybe he will leave me alone now.  Lizabeth and I hung out a little bit and she passed out on the couch and I passed out on the love seat.  Matt was messing with my head, Sarah sent me 2 text messages and I slept through all that, but then she called and woke me up... GRRRRR jk But then I was an ass to everyone for about 30 min while I tried to wake up.   Today was Little Matt's birthday, but before i was told that I decieded to go to Wild Bills with Lindslut 2.  I haven't hung out with her much, and Carl doesn't hand out with her or want anything to do with her, and he was trying to persuade me not to hang with her, but I did.  It was ok, we picked up a bunch of Wal-Mart people that i don't know, and 2 of them were black and I almost dropped a few N-bombs on the way, but I kept them in.  They were all cool people.  My brother and little matt came up to Wild Bills.  It was my brothers first time and I think he liked it, cause they were playing his type of music tonight.  I ended up seeing Raven that I worked with at Eckerd and then Toni who I remembered from 2857 on Five Forks, she was friends with Rachel and Nicole.  I had seen many nude pictures of her. hehehehe.  Little Matt had gone to the rest room and washed the big black X's off his hands.  Well one of the security dudes busted him and tried to give my brother shit, until he saw his wristband.  Little Matt got kicked out and I was tired so I ended up leaving too... I also didn't really want to leave with Lindsey.  Being picked up first was ok and talking on the way to Wal-Mart was cool, but I have a feeling that she would have taken them home first and then taken me home last and I might have kept drinking and there is a situation I just don't want to be in... Esp since on my way home she sent me a TM asking if I would date her.  I told her that I didn't know, but I'd have to get to know her better.... I don't know, I just don't know. Or maybe I know too much.   Then I get home and I am missing $360... NOT COOL... But it was found with more money from Matt... WHHEEWWW WEEEEEEEE

      Since yesterday's postponement of the Dawsonville and Dahlonega trip, today was the best day to go.  I went to the outlet mall in Dawsonville, but didn't get anything cause the season change over has already occured.  WHICH SUCKS, cause I need some shorts and some nike sandals, since somehow I lost the ones I had. UGH oh well.  I called my old roomate Christoper Davis to see if he still worked at the outlets in Dawsonville and he ended up calling me back while I was in Dahlonega.  I don't think Lizabeth has ever been to Dahlonega, we went by my Old Apartment to start off and then at The Robyn's Nest, mmmm good food, thats when Christoper called me and we met up at Eckerd, talked with Cora for a little bit and then Lizabeth, Cherish, Christoper and I went over to Camp Glisson to the waterfall and just chilled.... Well for the most part until Feda started calling me about wanting money to pay his rent since he got fired.  I answered at first and I hung up when I knew it was him, then Christopher answered and gave him some crap that he didn't know who I was... so Feda hung up, and then called back again at which time Lizabeth answered and told him that if he kept calling and harassing me that Gwinnett PD would be answering and he would have some charges placed on him for threating me.. He didn't like it too much and started bitching at her... I think she hung up on him.  After that we headed over to North Ga and drove around the campus a little bit and also walked around the campus.  It is FROG week this week so all the new cadets are getting their training and stuff.  "Right Face, forward march.... Doubletime March." UGH...  "EWW AHH ECHO"  We went to the bookstore to see Alumni stuff and they didn't have a great selection and I also saw someone who had quit the Corps.  I felt bad for him and thought about giving him some words of encouragement...  I also told Lizabeth that when we walked by them, they couldn't look at her.  hehehehe I am so mean.   Then we drove past the biggest house ever on top of a mountain and drove by the old apartment over the garage that I had, and then headed home through Gainsville.  Time flew by and we had to head to Sallies to pick her up for the Braves game.  We had some really good seats.  In left field about 8 rows back from the wall.  We saw Ian Knight would had played football for UGA.  The game started off slow, but then the lights went out in half of the stadium... Thats when the Braves turned it up and won the game.  We also headed up to the Coca-Cola Sky Field above Turner Field.  WOW, it's cool up there.  Plus Lizabeth needed to get off our asses and move around.  We had been sitting a shit ton today.   Damn Just tried to pay my power bill and it told me to try again after 1a.m.  DAMN BASTARDS, I want to give my money now.. NOT LATER.  I plan on sleeping at 1am.  Chris keeps calling me wanting me to go to Luby's.. UGH.  I need sleep not parting.  I'm not Rick James Bitch.

      I woke up early so that I would be ready to head off to Dawsonville and Dahlonega.  Lizabeth were on our way and I think she had called her mom to tell her something and her mom was a total ass to her.. which really isn't that weird.  But then I fill up and about to start on my way when Lizabeth's mom calls back and from the look on her face I knew something bad had happened.  Well her step-dad/dad lost his job.  Ugh I know how that feels and I know what must be going through his mind and it sucked that when I took Lizabeth home to change her dad really wouldn't talk about anything.  But I guess he keeps alot inside and then bursts it out later.  Cause I think Lizabeth got yelled at later.   Lizabeth and I goofed off for the most part.  She turned in some applications I looked at places I would apply but they aren't hiring and I really don't want another retail job.  Then we went to David's Bridal and she showed me the dress that she will be wearing for Monica's wedding.  It was very nice.  Then we drove around and ended up looking at new houses.  That was fun but we didn't have alot of time because I had to meet up at Mark's house for Drew to come pick us up.  Looking at houses with Lizabeth was fun.  Even though the houses were ugly as shit.   Prince night 2...  Same rules as last night, basicly almost the same show.  Morris Day and the Time opened once again.  They changed their set only a little bit.  I have heard them 3 times in the last 4 days.  I am getting their songs stuck in my head and it's not cool.  I saw a few of the same people from Prince night 1.  There were two girls that were sitting in front of me that ended up on the oposite side of the stage tonight, and a few other people recognized me.  I also saw Dominiuque Wilkins, the former Atlanta Hawk, for the second night in a row.  It seemed like a really long night even though The Time actually went on stage on time, and Prince came on stage at about 8:45 which was real early compared to last night 9:15 or so.

      I didn't sleep much last night due to the fear that monster roaches that live outside our apartment were crawling all over me... That isn't a pleasant way to try and sleep. I also woke up around 1a.m. because Lindslut 1 called me and left me a voicemail that she was really drunk and told me to call her back... So I called her back thinking she might need a DD and didn't answer which kinda freaked me out. Lizabeth told me later in the morning that she did have a D.D. so that was a load off my mind for the morning... Even though it was almost day time.  Lizabeth and I went to the pool early. It was the first day of school for Gwinnett children and Lizabeth didn't have to watch her brother and sister. Also my friend Robert moved to Texas today so we made plans to meet him at Dillions for lunch before he left. Well, he didn't make it because he had to go get his paycheck from Jason's Deli off Ashford Dunwoody Rd. So Lizabeth and I ate and then went back to the pool. We had fun, we tried turning each other on, and just goofed off and got some sun. In the time it took for me to shower and get ready to go to the Prince concert a notice was placed on the door that now the back pool will be closed due to some assholes who vandalized the pool area over the weekend. AHHHHHHHH so now both pools are closed. DAMN THESE PEOPLE!!!!  The Prince concert was cool. We didn't have many people inside the barricade so I was on the outside and had to keep the open area in front of me clear. Which wasn't a problem, and I had this big tit chic come down who I think ended up being kicked out because she would not stay in her seat. Everyone was staring at these. They were laughing at me cause they told that I should have pushed her back with my hands on her boobies. Oh well. Hopefully he will change the show for tomorrow night... Cause the same show two nights in a row is not much fun. OH and it was nice to have a show without Chris. I think everyone was happy about that. We made fun of Japan and how no one can really understand what he says most of the time.  Now for the commentary..... Where to begin. Well first off I don't know Mr Bob all that well, I only met him on my last trip down to Milledgeville, He seems like a nice guy, but at the same time he kind of scared me. I don't know how, and I don't know why. I don't know what happened between him and his wife, soon to be ex-wife and It might not be any of my business. I really haven't' asked any questions, or said much because I don't want anyone getting pissed off at me for what I have to say. Basically I guess I have watched Mr. Bob go from being psycho 29 year old to beingMr. Bob that is kinda sorta dating my best friend. I was going to go with Lizabeth and Sarah to meet up with him one day and he didn't want to be seen in public nor with anyone else. Which to me was very strange that 2 weeks later it seems he doesn't care anymore. I know that he is getting a divorce, but I don't know that I would pursue someone else while still being married to someone else, there are major repercussions in that especially if she finds out what is going on and could get him in some serious trouble. I would be very cautious with things just because if he is doing things like this now, who's to say that he might not do it again later on with someone else. I of course don't know a lot of things about the situation, but as a friend I like to make sure that my friends are not being hurt or taken advantage of or are in any kind of situation in which they could be endangering themselves. I respect any decision Sarah makes with all of this and I will continue to listen and give advice if she wants any.  My opinions are not necessarily those of blogger.com or any of the advertisers that may pop up when you open this window.

      Well the brrrrmp from last night carried over to today... I didn't do much today, just chilled at the apartment.  I am so tired from lack of sleep, but I haven't been able to sleep much at all.  I am not sure what is up with that.  That last good night sleep I had was earlier this week down in Milledgeville, usually it's the other way around, I hardly sleep in Milledgeville and then come home and sleep awesome... I don't know.  Today was definitely a better day than yesterday.  Stuff seemed to be going right.  I worked a Funk R&B show tonight.  I can't say that I have ever had to check tickets in the back of the 200's but tonight was that kind of night.  It SUCKED.  We had a minimal staff for a "sold out" Show.  And it was a show of 99% older black people.  I got hit on by this one lady all night long.  I even thought about getting her number, but then I would be crossing a line that I almost crossed a few years ago, but don't really want to.   I think I am going to try and call it an early night.  Maybe I will actually get some sleep.  I know my body feels like its going to crash and burn in a few minutes.

      To explain the BRRRRMP, it's a noise that chris and I heard a long ass time ago when we were drunk as shit... We had to pee and went to Quicktrip right by Dillions. We were pretty shitty. There were two cops inside but we had to go... Well in the bathroom the pipes in the walls kept making this noise and at first I thought Chris farted and he thought I farted. But it was a noise that went brrrmp. We laughed so hard coming out of the bathroom, the cops looked at us funny, and then made the noise all the way home... Every once in a while we remember and then just do that noise randomly... Tonight it was every time we saw an attractive girl. The ugly one's got us shaking all over.  Wild Bills was not happening tonight. It was quite dead. VERY dead after last night. But I was in a good mood, hyped up, and letting things roll out of my mouth that normally just stay inside my head. There were two girls who were having a bad night with ex husbands and husbands outside in the smoking area. They were out there a long time. The one who is now divorced was trying to help her friend who's soon to be ex-husband was giving her a bad time... Finally I went up to them and said. "You obviously came here to have a good time, stop worring about this shit, go grab another drink and have a good time!!", and they went inside and hopefully had a better time. Chris.. now this was strange.. Some girl just comes up to him and pulls him on the dance floor and tries slow dancing with Chris... He tried. It was quite funny. But then after the song was over Chris came back to me to get his drink. Well she comes back over to him and then kisses him on the lips... I hope she was drunk as shit. Cause it makes me feel like I must be pretty damn ugly. Soon after that we left and hopped on over to Luby's...  Lindslut 1 had called me earlier and invited me to Luby's and I told her if we left Wild Bills early I'd give her a call. So she said it was happenin. So we went. It was cool, Chris didn't get pissy with her for once... All since the bj incident they have not gotten along at all... Of course the twins were working so Chris had to bug them for a minute while I tried to get a coke. Then we went outside and sat at a table with some Joes Crap Shack Pleasant Hill people and some other random friends of theirs. It was cool. One of the girls is very nice and I know she has a man that she has been with for quite some time. But something happened and she came back to the table crying... I am not sure if they broke up or not or if something weird was going on, but Chris and I were talking to her until Chris shut me out totally and I couldn't say anything else cause it was all him... and that really pissed me off. So he ends up getting her number. Ok so I must really be ugly.  Overall it was a fun night. I haven't had fun at home in a long time. Especially after the way things started off today. It was like I woke up on the wrong side of the bed or breaking the waffle house tradition after working a show last night might have caused this day to be messed up. It started with me forgetting to change my away message, then forgetting my cigarettes, then forgetting my phone in the car while looking for Lizabeth inside target, then not understanding that Lizabeth had to pick up Rachel at her friends house before going back to her house, then having Lizabeth check my phone and read MY text messages so that I didn't know I had any, then having one of the fired employees call me up and yell at me for him being fired, then loosing 3 of my concert checks in wal-mart, my pen dying at the bank, almost forgetting my cell phone at the bank, finding out that the Eckerd case is closed and I have to do what I have to do with Feda,  almost driving into a dead end leaving Best Buy, and then having to pay for chris' meal at the Checkered Parrot because chris' card was declined.  Right now its 2:15 a.m. and I wish Chris would leave so that I could go to bed. He has to be at work at 9... Good Night and Sweet dreams everyone!!!!

      Today was a cool day, not much happened.  Chilled with Lizabeth for a while, hadn't seen her in a few days since I had gone down to the lake.  I was gonna try and get her to come down next week, but like usuall I think it's a lost cause.  If its not something close by or if her mom might have a problem with it, it's one of those things where it's written off as a no.  I used to be that way too.  My parents wouldn't ever let me do something fun.  I had to lie to them about who I was going to the beach with if I was actually going with Alexis alone, but it's all good.  It took me a long time to be able to just ask them to do stuff with me realizing that it didn't matter I could do what I wanted to, for the most part.  The day I told my parents I was going to ask Alexis to marry me, they were actually happy for me.  They knew that it was what I wanted.  That's all good now too.  Well kinda, cause eventually I do want to be married and I do want a family and I do want to be happy again.  Tonight was another concert.  Barenaked Ladies and Alanis Morisette with some random person opening that could have put everyone to sleep.  I hadn't seen Alanis since the JaggedLittle Pill tour back in the Omni.  That album came out in 1995.  WOW, that was a long ass time ago.  She sold out the Omni too.  This tour had less people than last night.  It was a very very small crowd.  Barenaked Ladies could have put me to sleep too.  They had a few songs that I like, all of them have been on the Radio.  "One Week", "It's all been done", "Pinch Me" and one other one that I don't know the name of... The only good part of their show was the jokes and fun that they put into being on stage.  They had some strange choreography that they did too, that was quite entertaining.  Alanis... WOW, I am supprised that more people didn't come to see her.  She put on a great show.  I will admit I don't like her new stuff too much, but she played a crap load from Jagged Little Pill and it sounded great. She did "All I really want", "You Oughta Know", "Hand in my Pocket", "You Learn", "Head Over Feet", and "Ironic" from that album.  I wish my brothers friends had never stolen that from me.  OH Well, I guess I need to get it used somewhere.  Once again we had wristbands on the people in the front row.  Dennis and I were the only ones in the pit.  He had one gate and I had the other.  During Barenaked one of the guitarists ran through my gate all the way to the lawn.  Towards the very end of Alanis we had this guy try to run down on the front row and Drew tried to stop him, but the guy turned around and tried to hit or do something to Drew and a fight broke out right in front of the stage.  I had to help restrain the guy while back up was on the way.  We aren't sure what that guy's deal was.  It was fun though.   On the way home Chris and I were headed to Waffle House until we decieded to hit Wild Bills instead... BAD IDEA.  The line was almost going around half the side of the building.  We still went it, but it was very much packed and tiredness quickly took over, even though I am still typing at 2a.m.  UGH.  Wait sleep is over rated!!  For Chris it was Japan story night again... Some dude told chris "This isn't Japan man" "Uh oh he has a new girl to talk to" "She has handle bars" "Someone get some air freshener, it smells like puke on this side of the stage" "In a bad year he makes $100,000" "It is now one of those kinda shows"

      Well I am back at my apartment.  Took a couple of days to relax down on the Lake in Milledgeville.  I think I cooked myself on Tuesday.  Sarah and I chilled on the lake for quite a few hours.. Took a break and then Kenda joined us out in the lake for a while.  That's probably the longest period of sun I have had all this summer.  At the beginning of the summer it was almost a daily thing to go lay out and I had a decent tan going on, but then I gave up.  Kenda and I talked a little on early Wednesday morning I hadn't met her since she had just moved in with Liz, Ro and Sarah.  I had fun, and I am in the process of working something out with Little Matt cause he wants to enjoy the lake... I am also gonna work on getting lizabeth down, but I know that will never happen...  On my way home from Milledgeville I decided to stop by the cemetary and vist Chris Young.  I haven't visited him in a long time.  I talked to him for a while about things that are going on in my life and how much everyone misses him still and how he will never be forgotten.  It's hard to believe in October it will be 2 years since he left the world.  It's amazing how many things have changed in my life in what seems like such a short amount of time.  Tonight Chris and I worked the Kiss/Poison concert.  We both saw them last year.  Kiss was on tour with Areosmith and Poison was on tour with skid row and someone else.  It was a decent show.. the night went by fast.  Which is a sign it was a good show... I hate the nights that seem to never end.  Saturday night will be one of those nights.  Tomorrow night is Alanis Morisette and the Barnaked ladies.  Haven't seen Alanis since Jaged little pill at the Omni.   I feel like I have a hammer bashing me somewhere in the top of my head and my face feels like I got kicked again.  I thought maybe I was hungry from not eating dinner till late, I did have a kinda early lunch today.   Well I am off to bed... Maybe I will write more in the morning

      ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, The last time I worked the Rush concert I fell asleep... This time I would have loved to have fallen asleep.  Only it was extremely hot out and Lizabeth tried calling me during our meeting so I sent her to voicemail.  Well she sends me a text message that I can read when our meeting breaks... Well I read it and she lets me know that her dog has died.   Lately Tag has tried to hump my leg alot, which has made me freaked out, but still he was a really cool dog and it was fun to play with him when he wasn't trying to hump me.  I am going to miss Tag as I am sure Lizabeth and her family will too.  Their cat also died recently but it was old so it was time for it to go.  Tag apparently had cancer which no one knew about.   Rush was boring as usual.  We had to sit in chairs for this show and in the pit we were supposed to be out of sight from the band memebers and we weren't supposed to really interact with the crowd.  But Chris couldn't sit still and interacted with the crowd.  This was one of the first shows at HiFi Buys that we put wristbands on the people in the front row.  That way people from other rows can easily be spotted.  We had fun kicking people off the front row.   This weekend went very quickly... Maybe that's a good thing cause Monday after Carl gets off work we are heading to Milledgeville for a few days.  Carl hasn't been to the lakehouse yet so this will be a fun trip for him.  Well it should be fun for me too.  I got alot of things on my mind and alot of decisions to make.  I got lectured by my grandmother today saying that my attitude was probably one thing that got me fired at Eckerd.  Well she is right.. Everything she said was the truth and I already knew what she was saying to me.  I had no desire to get a position higher than being an assistant manager.  I have been bogged down by that job for a long long time.  It was really a high schoolers job.  I wasn't having fun anymore.  Amy was making my life a living hell.  The DM and FEPS were getting on my case alot over stupid shit.  I've been over due to move on, I just shouldn't have been fired.  She made the point that I left the bank on not so good terms and now I've left Eckerd on not so good terms.   Then she started lecturing me on why I am not dating someone.  It's funny that when I was dating someone she had a problem with it.  She encouraged me daily to get rid of Alexis.  Which is a good thing, and I am much happier without her, but I don't need a bunch of crap on how I need to be dating someone.  It's all in the hands of someone of a higher power than me....  Well I am super tired and I have alot of things that need to be done Monday, that I know I won't do, but oh well.  I'll write more soon.

      I just realized it's August 1st, 2004. It seems like yesterday it was Easter, my birthday, or even the 4th of July. It's amazing how the time goes by so fast.  In my quest for a job, I mainly talked to all my friends about what they knew they could do for me with their workplaces... I had many leads and I began narrowing them down quickly because of pay issues. As of right now I am probably going to be working construction for a little while. My printer has issues and I can't print out any resumes which pisses me off. I do have resumes out of yahoo and monster. Maybe I will get some hits off those, but I have had a resume on monster since before I even graduated college in 2001.  Yesterday Matt and I drove around doing random things. He wanted to eat IHOP for breakfast, but I was a little slow getting ready so we changed plans around a few times. We went to my parents house and visited them for a bit. Muffin would not stop barking and it was making me mad.. My mom is reading some book on being positive about stuff and she made me read a chapter about the power of a smile. I guess cause I've been really down. Then Matt and I went to IHOP had lunch, headed over to Best Buy, then Media Play.. Decided we wanted to go to 311 and went to the mall to see if Chris wanted to go.. Chris was in a bad mood and came out of the kitchen cussing up a storm.. Some lady at a table started yelling at Chris, and a server had to tell Chris to calm down... Then Chris started up again and the lady yelled at him again.. I felt like yelling at her and telling her to shut up, but I let it go... Chris didn't' need to be doing that anyway. Then Matt and I went to Publix to see how much tickets were, but they were a little expensive and I decided it would be better for me to go to Monica and Aarons to celebrate Aarons birthday and talk to him about the job he had offered to me. We swam in the pool, Monica got popped in the nose while Aaron was trying to knock Lizabeth and Monica off of the raft. We ate pizza and then Lizabeth and I ran to the store and the girls ate sherbert while Aaron and I split a family size tube of cookie dough.... mmm yummy until we started watching Jackass.. The movie. After watching someone puke a few times I was done with the cookie dough, but I had finished a major portion of it.  After taking Lizabeth home, Chris calls and wants me to meet him at Wild Bills, I am still in my swim suit and don't feel like going out, but when I get home Andrew is on the phone with Chris and he doesn't want to go either.. So I went. Chris was trashed.. He bought me a shot, and then soon after I cut him off.. Walked around with him to sober him up before heading back to the apartment. When I had gotten to wild bills I almost got hit by a crazy guy driving a big pick up truck.. He had no lights on and when I turned down the row to park I realized that the guy had hit some cars and ran. WOW, stupid shit. Then on the way home from Wild Bills I almost rear ended Chris... Thank GOD I have good breaks...  Random quotes..  "The torpedo looks like a dildo" "I have one ball." "I have two long objects and three balls." "I see nip" "I think the frog just shit on your cigarettes." "OH GOD it peed on my cigarettes." "Young Man, take it outside." "That is the loudest bachlorette party I have ever been around." "Chris tried to join the party so we had the meskin kick him out."
