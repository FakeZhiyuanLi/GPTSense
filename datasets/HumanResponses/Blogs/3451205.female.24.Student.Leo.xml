      Sometimes, Germany really sucks! Especially German TV. If I had to name one thing that sucks most in Germany, I’d say German television. Now, in order to understand what I’m talking about, you (who are most likely from anywhere but Germany) have to get some background information: First of all, non-German movies or TV-shows on German television are always dubbed.. meaning, if you watch “Friends” you won’t get to hear the actors and actresses’ original voices but some German actors / actresses speaking in German… now, this usually works because we’re doing it so often that we know how to avoid lip asynchrony and such things .. and I have to say, the German voices for the characters of “Friends” have been well chosen.. they come quite close to the original.. but bad examples can be found as well.. for example, Scully (from The X-Files) has a rather high voice in the original.. here in Germany, she has a very low voice, as if she was a heavy smoker or something.. so, the first time a German viewer would see the US original, he or she would be like “holy shit.. how is she talking???”.. But this is not the worst thing.. the problem with recent movies is that the German scripts get worse and worse.. for example, in the US, everybody knows what a Q-Tip is… it’s the same as when someone talks about an “Apple” in Computer Science.. you know that he or she is not talking about a green fruit but about some sort of computer.. now, back to the Q-Tip: in Germany, this is not a common name because other companies sell those things over here and, of course, they can’t use a registered trademark.. so, we have our own word for Q-Tip (which is “Ohrstäbchen”).. now, there’s this TV show called “Scrubs” (used to be on Thursday nights in the US.. I don’t know if it still is right now) in which one of the main characters got the nickname “Q-Tip”.. guess what they’re doing in Germany? He’s still called “Q-Tip” in the dubbed version even though all those viewers who have never been to the US will not get the joke… that’s ridiculous! A similar thing happened with the movie “The talented Mr Ripley”.. on one occasion, the main character, Tom, is called “peeping Tom” which is a wonderful word play in English.. but of course, in Germany, hardly anybody knows what a peeping Tom is.. do you think they translated it in the dubbed version? NO, of course, they didn’t! And it still gets better: when it comes to movies with a lot of singing – recent movies, I have to add – then the German script writers simply screw everything.. it didn’t use to be that way.. take “My Fair Lady” for example.. this movie got a complete German script.. everything was dubbed, conversations and the whole singing. Even though some people complain that you can’t translate British Cockney accent, the German writers still did a very good job. Eliza Doolittle got a Berlin accent, which is not the same as Cockney, but the most important thing is, everybody understood what she was saying / singing, and the message of the movie was not altered or made unrecognizable!  Now, take “Moulin Rouge”, a recent movie. I happened to watch the German version on TV last night and I got so pissed.. first of all, only talking is dubbed.. the songs are still in English. Don’t get me wrong, that’s fine with me.. I like the voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman and it’s perfectly reasonable that no German actor / actress attempts to do better.. plus, I do understand what they’re singing, but the thing is, most other Germans don’t. So, what would be the easiest solution to this problem? Right, use subtitles for the songs! And what doesn’t happen on German TV? Right: there are NO subtitles! Now, this wouldn’t be a big deal with movies such as, uhm say, “Grease” or “Saturday Night Fever” or whatever.. but in “Moulin Rouge”, the songs are part of the plot.. they add extra information and you can’t just leave them out.. the ordinary German viewer wouldn’t probably even notice that the songs are important, but of course, the script writers screw that as well.. as soon as there’s a spoken word or something that comes close to being spoken, it gets dubbed.. so, there’s this duet of McGregor and Kidman in which he wants her to love him but she is afraid the relationship wouldn’t work out.. so at some point, McGregor goes like “Come love me” and Kidman sings “You will be mean” and McGregor answers “No I won’t”. But since he doesn’t sing this last line, it gets dubbed (“Nein, werde ich nicht” in German).. now, imagine you’re watching a movie in a language you don’t understand and suddenly one of the characters says “No I won’t” in your language. You’ll wonder, what the hell it is that he won’t do??? And unless you have a native speaker next to you, you’ll never find out.. isn’t that ridiculous??????  So, as you might have read between the lines, there’s a tendency in Germany that everything has to be in English.. especially in business, people seem to think that German things stink and English things are cool.. now again, don’t get me wrong.. I do like English things, and I’m far from being a German nationalist.. the thing is, how can I value distinctive English products if some German dorks screw everything? How can I love the English language, if there’s incorrect English wherever you go in Germany? I mean, if I had the money, I’d emigrate immediately, and then, those German idiots could do what they want, I wouldn’t care.. but unfortunately, this is not an option right now.. so, here I am, stuck in a country that’s slowly losing its identity (or at least the chance to create a distinctive German post-WWII-identity). Again, some examples will better illustrate what I’m talking about.. let’s start with some simple things: those of you who are native English speakers, do you know what a “Handy” is? Or a “Barkeeper”? Or a “Dressman”? Or a “Hometrainer”? Well, these are all “German” expressions for things that have a different name in real English. A “Handy” is a cellphone, a “Barkeeper” is simply a bartender, a “Dressman” is a male model, and a “Hometrainer” is any kind of fitness machine you can buy for yourself. You see where this is going to? A few German executives in various fields of business tend to think that English is cool and that people only buy products if they have an English name, no matter whether it’s a real word or not. (there must be some psychological explanation behind this which has to do with Germans being afraid of themselves because of their past, and so on, but I don’t wanna bore you with that)  The examples above are simple.. they might amuse native English speakers but you can easily ignore them.. now, it gets more interesting. Not only do Germans create their own “English” words, they also mix English and German whenever they find a chance to do so. In case you don’t happen to know it, German has more articles than English, and one of them is “die” (pronounced like “deeh”), which is the same as “the” but only used for feminine nouns. So, some German wannabes think they have to announce special offers in their stores with an English slogan because this is oh so creative (nowadays, German slogans can actually be considered creative because there are hardly any in Germany), but since they are Germans, they can’t do it right.. they expect their customers to know the words “happy” and “weeks” but they don’t expect them to know the simple word “the”.. and the result on their sign is, you got it: “Die Happy Weeks”! Applause, applause, applause!  OK, and there’s even something worse than that: how would you call a bag in which you can carry books or folders or school stuff in general or whatever personal belongings you have? Well, how about a book bag? Or maybe a shoulder bag if you can carry it around your shoulder? Or maybe just a “bag”? Sounds okay, doesn’t it? Now, you’d never guess how Germans call it! They use the word (and I don’t mean a German translation for it, no no.. the English word) “bodybag”!!! Hello??? How stupid do you have to be to get a job in the marketing industry? Do only those people qualify who can’t tell an apple from a banana? Is there a special test, in which all intelligent applicants are removed from the waiting line? Do you only qualify if your head is filled with peanuts instead of a brain?  I mean, how hard is it to look in a dictionary and to realize, “oops, the word ‘bodybag’ has some negative connotations, maybe I should find another name for my product”???  So, there you go.. now you know all about Germany you need to know.. if you should be planning a visit to Germany because you want to get to know some typical German things, you’re a few years too late.. sorry folks.. nowadays, you’ll only find “backshops” (pseudo-German for “bakery”) and stupid things like that.. well, the good thing is, after you enjoyed our “Die Happy Weeks”, you can immediately buy your own customized “bodybag”…   Willkommen in Deutschland.. oh sorry, of course, I meant, Welcome to Germany!

      I'd never have guessed that I would say something like this, but lawnmowing can actually be fun :-O Well, not really fun.. but I did almost all of my parents' garden today and it kept me busy.. so, no time for thoughts I don't wanna have right now..  Actually, I think I entered the stage where you deny everything.. I keep thinking that this girl Mr Right is drawn to already has a boyfried or is not interested for some other reason.. I just hope that I won't have to wait for another 4 months until I get to talk to Mr Right again... yeah, isn't that funny? we've reached the age of global villages and information superhighways but I still can't get a hold of Mr Right..   uh, apart from the usual routine, I did a Hollywood-like stunt today.. yar, well, it wasn't dangerous, but I had to laugh so hard.. my parents have this timer on their shades at the windows and the door to their patio, and so, in the evening we were sitting outside and just at the moment when I wanted to go in, the shades started coming down, and since I didn't know whether my Mom had her key, I ran towards the door and then managed to squeeze in in the last second.. this was so Indiana-Jones-like, I was already laughin before I touched ground inside.. attention dear Academy: here comes your next Oscar winner! :-))  Nighty everyone!

      I got a serious problem with alcohol... no, not what you think.. my problem is that I throw up before I'm really, really wasted.. so, I guess alcohol is not an option for me if I just want to forget about something.. but on the positive side, I'm getting funny results when drinkin almost a bottle of white wine while sitting all the time.. the first time I stand up then is really funny.. if Mr Right is not making the world go round and round for me, then at least, the white wine does so :-)) and I can sleep so well when I'm a little tippsy.. so, I won'T waste that opportunity now..  good night everyone out there.. may your lives be happy and, ah well.. I'm not a preacher :-)  good luck everyone!

      Ah well... slept over everything and still can't believe the things I said / did yesterday.. thought that maybe over night everything would suddenly and in a magical way resolve itself.. why hasn't anybody invented star-trek-like beaming yet? I could just beam over to Mr Right and tell him what I feel.. flight tickets are so frickin expensive..   dahh.. whatever.. I guess I'll go to one of my classes now and pretend I was listening to the teacher while I'm wasting too many thoughts on Mr Right instead...   quotation of the day:  Taoism: Shit happens.  Protestantism: Let shit happen to someone else.

      Really, life is funny.. as soon as I start a new blog, events are unfolding, my life gets shaken around a bit, I don't know what to write about first, and I'm just wondering if there's some kind of destiny for each and every one of us.. because if that's not the case, then there must be some really bitchy creature up there (or down there?) meddling with our lifes..  Well, for those of you out there who are in love with someone but are afraid to tell them, please, take my advice, and get over your shyness and shout it out loud. I've spent one year with a perfect guy but didn't realize it because, as we all do, I was hoping to get more than I could.. life is not perfect.. men are not perfect.. I do know that now.. so, that guy, (in a Sex-and-the-City-like fashion, let's just call him Mr Right) I had to leave him after one year because I was moving.. and I finally accepted the feelings I had for him.. but I didn't tell him.. so with the distance growing, my feelings also grew.. in an exponential way.. so, here I was, yearning for a guy who lives far away, and I didn't even dare tell him.. it would've been irrealistic to believe he would leave everything and follow me, wouldn't it?   so, now it's one year later (almost), and we had some trouble chatting regularly.. and of course, the less we talked, the more my feelings grew and the more I idealized him in my perfect little dream world.. today, we finally chatted for a while.. and, you guess it, he's seeing someone.. and not only that (no, that wouldn't be enough considering the bad luck that seems to be following me when it comes to relationships), he's even interested in yet another woman.. yeah.. life is what happens when you're busy making other plans..  now, good news first: if he's interested in another woman, that person he's seeing right now can't be mrs right. if she was the one for him, he wouldn't waste time looking into other options, wouldn't he?  secondly, the other girl he's interested in doesn't seem to reciprocate.. he said, he'll know by Friday but things are looking bad.. so, being the optimist to the end, maybe we're not supposed to be together now.. maybe I'm supposed to finish all my exams (I'm at the end of my studies right now), get my life in order, and then go for Mr Right?  Oh yeah, and you want to know the best part? When he told me about this girl he's interested in, I even told him to go for it and to find out about her feelings! Doesn't that deserve a medal? I guess, I just want him to be happy.. and if it's not with me, then, well.. I don't wanna continue that thought.. I'm just hoping things will work out and that there's some bigger destiny waiting for me.. for us..  So much for my day.. the rest was pretty boring.. received some materials for class I'm suppposed to read till next Tuesday. 400 pages! That's ridiculous.. but I don't care about any of my jobs or school right now.. Friday's gonna be a good day for me.. I know it.. sorry, Mr Right, I want you to be happy but.. well.. I don't know the girl, but I bet she's wrong for you...   Anyway.. as if this wasn't enough about destiny today, there's an old episode of "Charmed" on TV in which Cole (the cutest guy on the show.. but psst.. don't tell Mr Right ;-)) goes almost insane because he's so much in love with Phoebe.. now isn't that coincidental?  Alright.. enough of this soul-relieving blogging.. I gotta start getting my life back together.. at least, the Red Sox beat the A's 12:2 last night.. though that reminds me of Mr Right again.. he's one of those devoted fans..   Ah crap.. I hope you crazy lovers out there won't commit the same mistakes ..  Peace out!

      Oh, before I forget: RED SOX RULE! This is the year!!!  Actually, would the team be the same if they really won the World Series again? I mean, thousands (I even dare say millions) of dedicated Red Sox fans would lose their purpose in life, wouldn't they? But then again.. wouldn't it be worth it? :-)  P.S.: Does anybody know how I can get to see the Red Sox movie in Europe?

      OK, I have no idea how this is gonna work out... Had to do a presentation on blogs at school a few days ago and realized blogging is actually a cool thing to do.. so here I am..  you want a short description of myself? well, crazy, openminded, thinking too much about too many things, and with a pretty dark sense of humor. but sometimes I can't even help laughing about movies like, I dunno, The Naked Gun or some pretty silly stuff like this..  hm.. I'm not that good at characterizing myself.. so, why don't you see for yourself?  Enjoy your stay!

      I think I'm in for mood changes again.. paah.. well, not the kind of mood changes you'd expect from middle-aged women in their midlife-crises but just the kind of moods everyday events can cause.. maybe it's just the weather or the fact that I got a lof of fresh air over the weekend but this morning I could have jumped around for joy (except that I'm probably too lazy to jump around for nothing :-))  but the longer the day got, the more frustrated I got ..   first, I went to this class I'm taking and there were a couple of students giving short reports.. well, the first one was short and interesting and there's nothing to argue about.. but the second one was like torture.. there were three guys.. as far as I remember it was about a book by Noam Chomsky, some patriotism theory, and some other things.. but frankly, it's hard to remember anything.. this report was sooo soporific. I mean, if you know you gotta do a report on a rather boring subject, then you get your ass moving and start looking for some visual materials or whatever.. and if you can't find that, you try to organize your thoughts nice and clearly on hand-outs or something.. and the least you can do is to raise your voice from time to time to keep people awake.. well.. those three guys did NONE of it.. it was a damn stuffy room, these guys kept talking as if they were intentionally trying to talk themselves to sleep, and in their PowerPoint presentations they used endless, complete sentences instead of keywords.. damn, this is an upper-level seminar and these dorks don't even know how to give a presentation.. I mean, I'm not very good at it, but if I know it's gonna be hard to keep people's attention, then I won't make matters worse by committing all those errors these guys did..   so, I sat there and tried to listen to the speakers, but in fact, it was more interesting to watch our teacher trying very hard not to fall asleep himself. I bet he was wishing he hadn't decided to teach this class.. after 2 of the three speakers he decided to give us all a break and so I used the chance and left completely.. (several people had already done so before, while the guys were speaking).  Seriously, I'm in the middle of my exam preparations and I don't wanna waste my time sitting around and listening to fricking stupid presentations.. I would've learned more if I had read the Chomsky book myself..   in fact, this whole class sucks.. during the first session, I thought, yeah, it's gonna be great.. the class is about Media and Terrorism, and the teacher knows more than I will probably ever know about this subject matter.. but what's pissing me off is that this is an upper-level class and there's not even a single book or article that we have to read! sure, we got a bibliography but it's all voluntary and since the university system in Germany sucks, hardly any of the students will read any of the books.. so, the class basically consists of students giving presentations.. some of them are good, yeah, but most of them suck... but since attendance is obligatory, I have to show up regularly.. usually, I manage to sneak out after half of it, though, but it's a waste of time going there anyway..   so, after this, I was already quite pissed.. then a friend told me that there had been schedule changes for one of my other classes, and without going into details, the long story short is that it sucks.. so, negative message number two..  then, I actually had the chance to listen to an interesting talk by an American historian on Buffalo Soldiers and stuff like this.. the guy used to work in the Pentagon and if I remember correctly, he has been writing about and researching buffalo soldier issues for 30 years.. so, he seemed to be quite an expert, and, believe me, after this talk in my morning class, his report was like paradise.. he had slides and some short clips from movies, and he was speaking fluently and clearly, and there was no way someone could fall asleep..   after that, I chatted with a friend for almost an hour, and we both agreed on most matters regarding the quality of our studies here.. so, basically, for one hour, we talked about everything that was annoying us, and while this was a good way to get rid of some anger, it also made it clear to us that many things suck around here.. and the result was that I went home being even more pissed..   now, that I've thought about it for a while, I think it's mostly because of mr right.. I haven't heard from him yet (what a surprise) and it just sucks to be away from the center of action right now and to not have the chance to influence things directly.. if he was here, I'd probably love my life no matter how many stupid presentations I'd have to listen to..  I don't know what to do about it tho.. he doesn't seem to check his emails often (at least not the addies I'm writing to) and it's hard to reach him via phone, too.. so, I guess, if I meet him online next time, and provided this girl he's interested in turned him down, I'll just lay all my cards open.. I should probably promise this with witnesses present; otherwise, I'll prolly be too afraid to tell him everything.. so, let's make it official.. next time's the right time!  alright.. I guess, I'm heading towards my bed now.. time to finish this stupid day..  night everyone!

      It's that time of the year again.. about 80 % of the male population of Germany will start drinking excessively (yes, more than they're already doing right now), the newspapers will be full of silly headlines, and if you have some brain cells left you better don't turn on the TV because it will be full of nonsense-talking announcers. In case you haven't guessed it yet, it's time for the European Soccer Championship.   I think there's no word that would fit to describe how I feel towards soccer. I mean, it can be fun, and I played it a lot when still in elementary school, but as soon as you grow up and start thinking, you realize what crap and what hypocritical shit it actually is. I don't mean the game itself but the way it is played and dealt with in Germany. The media always repeat that Germany is a soccer nation and that "all" Germans are proud of their team, and so on.. well, guess what! I hate the team. They're a bunch of fricking losers who waste too much time fuckin women (never mind that they're married), driving fast cars, doing commercials, and lickin their money. It's ridiculous that some of the players get 2- or even 3-digit million dollar contracts and then all they have to do is stand around and kick some balls (well, I'm really talking about soccer balls now) without looking where their team members actually are. I've watched our women's soccer team play and some of the combinations they're doing are amazing. The ball's moving from one player to the next; no blind shooting, no fouls, just fair play. Our men's team instead is busy with spitting (oh, how I want to punch them in their faces when they do that), committing one foul after another, rolling on the ground crying because someone supposedly hurt them, and yelling at each other all the time. Our goalie is the worst. When he shouts at everybody else (and basically, that's what he's doing all the time), he really looks like a gorilla. Some clever fans even threw bananas at him during one game.  And of course, our team has no flaws at all. Whenever they lose, it's not the fault of the players but probably the weather was all wrong, or the opponent played unfair, or their shoes had not been broken in yet. Some months ago, there was a match between Germany and Iceland (which is like a match between the Yankees and some high-school team), and of course, our lazy German dorks lost the game. During the game, the announcers on TV made several remarks about how bad the team was playing, and they were right. I mean, it's their job to analyze the game. Now, guess what happened: after the game, the coach of our team insulted the announcers live and in front of several million viewers because "Germans are demanding too much, and we should stop expecting the team to win all the time." Hello?! This is Germany. Everything's about soccer! We're not supposed to lose against Iceland! Of course, the coach got away with his mean remarks, and he's still coaching the team. However, we lost the last preparation game before the Championship, and I just hope, we won't make it to the next round. We're in a group with the Netherlands and the Czech Republic; both nations have pretty good teams. I don't mean to be unpatriotic or something, but our team of losers (who are more aloof than you can imagine) just deserve to get their butts kicked.  So, starting this weekend, it's time for "Horaaayy for the Czechs and the Dutch!"  In the meantime, nothing has changed with the Mr Right situation. I haven't heard from him since that day when I told him to ask this girl out. I don't even know if he did it or how she reacted.  In fact, I really thought I was over him. During the past days I didn't spend too many thoughts on him, and I guess his telling me about his relations kind of roused me from my dreams. But then again, I found some old files of our online conversations yesterday, and they brought back the whole range of emotions. My attitude towards life is that everything happens for a reason, and I mean, this can't be it. He can't just enter my life so he could leave it again. I'm graduating in a few months and then I'll definitely go back to the US and visit him (unless he's engaged or something.. I couldn't take that). I know there's some hidden plan for us, but I haven't found out yet what it is.. well, I guess I'm back to optimistic day-dreaming now. At least, it makes everything much easier. And I'll cross the other bridges when I come to them.  So much for now.. back to studying hard now. Paaah..  May the force be with all of you!
