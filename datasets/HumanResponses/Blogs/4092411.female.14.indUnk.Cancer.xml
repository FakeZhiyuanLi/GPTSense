       I have no idea how to do html's. I'll have to ask Matthew later,so it's not my fault if my page is not very...correct... Anyway Matthew  told me to get a blog so I got one *rollseyes*.  
 I haven't really did anything today,went to the creek,read,rode my horse,. A pretty uneventful day,but I'm enjoying the little bit of freedom I have left .School starts soon. I look forward to seeing my friends and going to band. I don't look forward to Algebra,science or Techno :) 
 Well, now I have a blog to write about my uneventfulness. Tootles.

        Well, I started school last week and I am actually very happy to be back. I really missed my friends although depressingly they're only a few of them with any of the same classes. I only have Thomas in one and Matthew and Holly are in , guess how many......... Absolutely none of them. At least Kelcie is in all my classes, but two. I really can' t complain about my classes either. I really like algebra it's my favorite class . I finally get History and not Geography ( I want to Major in Archaeology). I get reading which is extremely easy. Mrs. Dillard is making us read a thirty page book *rollseyes*. I find it insulting that she doesn't think we're capable of reading more than what's included in a first grade reading book. Oh well, Let's not be Pessimistic. I'm writing an essay on what I could contribute to the yearbook staff . That's how they narrow down who gets to be on it. There is the limited amount of six people allowed. I'm also going to join chorus again this year Mrs. Manor doesn't mind if your tone deaf so I can still get on :). Plus I'm going to run for student council. I was in it last year,but then I was a seventh grader. Now I am in eighth and we ,my friends and I ,are now top dog of the school. Well I have to do my Algebra. Tootles :)

        Today I went to school. I saw like Nobody at all, except for my Bestfriend Kelcie, and Thomas and one of my friends  Cassie. Oh how I wish summer Vacation was here! (Even though I desperately need to improve my math.) Anyway just thought I would speak of the Future days of horror(school).

      Today I was Climbing my tree( the tree I always climb) and I was going to do a flip off the branches. Well I was hanging upside down and accidentally let go. The worst part though was that I fell into a fold out chair that was full of rain water so now I'm soakin' wet. :) Anyway only 3 days until school is here. How utterly depressing.Anyway I look forward to seeing my friends. Tootles

       Hey, I've been busy lately or I would have wrote the past two days. The day before yesterday I was in Chattanooga. I went to Hamilton Place Mall and bought books at Walden's bookstore.( Pendragon "Black Water" and The Complete Poems/Stories of Edgar Allan Poe) Then I had to go to Giant Steps and get my Saxophone repaired (Head piece recorked and octave key replaced.) I've already finished my Pendragon book. It's another cliff hanger like the Reality Bug, and guess what. The next book doesn't come out until ........ summer 2005! Don't you hate that. Now everyone who has read it has to wait a whole 'nother' year to see what happens.Anyway some of my Bro's friends are spending the night tomorrow.(absolute catastrophe) :) Well, that's all for now.

      I went fishing at my Small pond in my front yard today.With my three cousins Shania age 7, Dolton age 8,and Colton age 12 . There's nothin'' in there, but small Brim and a few catfish so I don't even know why I try. I tried to ride Fritz ,my horse, but he's been mad at me ever since I made him run around the field so he wouldn't come to me. It wasn't like I enjoyed the last time I rode neither . The mean thing threw me off. I guess I'll just have to start using the saddle more often so I have something to hold me in place. I usually ride bareback.Oh well, I need to go change my template Matthew says it's messed up. I think I messed it up when I tried to Customize it.Tootles.
