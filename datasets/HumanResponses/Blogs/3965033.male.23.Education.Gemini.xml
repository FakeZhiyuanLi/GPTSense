      This is amusing. ( urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/07/31/sign.of.shame.ap/index.html ) Sure, big companies and big countries can take oil and charge lots of money for it, but don't even think about stealing four dollars worth of gas.

      So apparently, the Vatican released a letter about gender and the church today, and said all sorts of things about feminism that were supposed to be bad (homosexual and heterosexual relationships are virtually equal, I believe one of them was).  This article (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3940719.stm) details the letter, and has some awesome quotes from feminists towards the bottom.

      Katha Pollitt makes a good point in her column in the Nation.  urlLink (http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040816&amp;s=pollitt ) Why do we let the right frame the debate on values? Why don't we articulate our own values, like fairness, equality, and so on?   urlLink

      In keeping with my general malaise these days surrounding what level of interaction with the mainstream //fill in the blank//: (i want, is productive, is healthy, is possible, etc.), I have come across this site: www.axisofeve.com.  Nothing like funny underwear to undermine a fascist regime.  I know that there are always those who posit that it is unproductive to be so "outlandish" in working for social change, because it will only undermine the seriousness of our task, but I am frustrated by this.  Margaret Cho, Whoppi Goldberg, this website, they are more ME, make me more connected and intune with my political feelings on so many things than the HRC, the DNC, and so forth.  So where does that leave me?  Where does that leave all of us?  I am feeling conflicted.  Thoughts?

      Carl Wittman wrote his gay manifesto in the early 70s. I re-read it recently for my History of Sexuality class and it's fabulous. I'm trying to find it online so I can post it here. In the meantime, please let me know if any of you happen to stumble across it. Thanks =)

      Gretchen and I created this space to have an ongoing conversation with our friends about things that are important to us. We were inspired by our friends at ustoo ( urlLink http://ustoo.blogspot.com/ ). We're very new to this, so it will take us a while to work out the kinks, but we're glad you're here! &nbsp; Bryan

      I read this interesting article about Bill Cosby today on Slate (http://www.slate.com/id/2103794/), and would be interested in hearing others' opinions about reform vs. revolution (or some other choice of words) in relation to social justice.  Amiri Baraka (http://www.amiribaraka.com/ and http://www.umich.edu/~eng499/people/baraka.html)is from Newark and his daughter Shani Baraka (http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/column96a.html) used to teach at my school before her murder last year.

      My cousin in North Dakota sent this to me. I can't decide if I'm highly amused or mighty frightened.  Check it out. ( urlLink http://www.jibjab.com/ )
