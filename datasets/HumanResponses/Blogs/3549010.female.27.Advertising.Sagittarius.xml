      So yesterday, at 9am... I awoke to tapping on my leg.  I sat up, making sure I was covered since I was sleeping nude.  I don't normally sleep nude because I have a roommate Manny.  But since he had left to go to Portugal for the  urlLink Euro Cup , I didn't have to worry about him accidentally seeing me naked.  I had no idea I was going to be awakened by my ex-boyfriend Ken!!!  Shocked, startled, confused, all I could ask was, "What are you doing here?"  He replied that he had an 11 hour lay-over on his way to Portugal and was going to sleep in Manny's bed.  He currently lives in LA, so I guess he was connecting through NYC.  WHAT?!?!?  Unannounced, uninvited, he simply barges in with a set of keys I didn't know he had in his possession!  I let him sleep, then went my soccer game.  I came home by 4:30pm, hoping he had left for the airport.  Sadly, he was still there.  And he actually didn't leave until 6pm for an 8:25pm flight.  Horrible decision since his flight was out of Newark and it was going to take him awhile to get out there with traffic.  Needless to say, he came barging through the door again at 9pm without so much as a phone call and said he missed his flight and would be flying out at the same time tomorrow.  He asked Manny for permission to stay at the apt, but he didn't ask the person who is living here?!?!?  He kept going on and on and on about how happy he was with his new girlfriend, with his life out in LA, how he knows all of these celebrities and is friends with strippers.  I really didn't give a shit.  I was so thankful that he decided to leave for  urlLink The Parlour  to grab some drinks.  After work today, I came home praying and hoping that Ken had left for the airport.  And thank god, my prayers were answered.  HOWEVER, I found remnants of Ken's visit all over the apartment.  There were three very wet towels strewn across the living room.  And he must've borrowed one of Manny's t-shirts because I found it lying on the bathroom floor.  There were about a hundred cigarette butts in a coffee mug mixed in with empty pistachio shells.  French fries in its aluminum container on the coffee table, yet used ketchup packets still oozing with ketchup on Manny's papers.  And a half-eaten pizza still in its box sitting on my sofa.  AAAAAAAAAH!  How inconsiderate can one man be?!?!?  He doesn't even ask ME if he can stay.  He just shows up un-announced and leaves a mess.  Should I have handled this differently?  Anyway, I sent Manny an email saying that Ken is no longer allowed to stay at our apartment should he ever visit again prior to us moving out.  I'm still in disbelief and shock of it all.

      We won first place today at the Goals For Life tournament in Montclair, New Jersey.  My soccer team  urlLink Central Park Rangers  (CPR) - Women's Team, met at 6:45am!!!  Luckily, the meeting point was at the Avis two blocks from my apartment on 76th & Broadway. After a restless night of very little sleep, I awoke at 6:30am... a little later than I wanted to wake up and stumbled the two blocks to find that I wasn't the last to arrive.  Whew!  I'm always late, so it's a great, but rare feeling for me when I'm not the reason holding up a group of people.  First game was at 8am... it took us awhile to get our groove on, but we found ourselves dominating the other team on a very short, lumpy grass field.  By half time, the score was 4-0.  In the 2nd half, the other team had a lucky goal, but we answered  back with 4 more goals to win 8-1.  The second game was at 10am on the nice turf field, the same kind that we're used to playing on.  Again we played well against a team that had enough subs to form a second team.  In the end, we won 3-0.  The third and final game was at 12:30am on a grass field, just as lumpy as the first, but not as short.  This game was ugly.  The other team played really dirty and kept hacking.  They were physically very intimidating too, but our skill definitely proved to be better.  At one point though, I had a collision with their stopper who happened to be the largest women on their team.  The collision didn't fade the big girl at all... she simply remained standing while I bounced off and landed on my ass.  Seriously wondering if we were ever going to score, we finally did and won 4-0.  With 3 wins and 15 goals for, we knew that the only way we would lose the 1st place title was if the team also in contention for the title won their last game by 6 goals.  Thank god they didn't.  All in all, a great day of soccer.  Personally, I think I played very well.  I had a few assists, a couple of shots on goal (none of which went in though) and stellar passes and dribbling.  I rather enjoy playing stopper with the freedom to push up and roam around the field when the opportunity presents itself.  Hopefully, I can continue to grow into that position.  Exhausted now... spent rest of day walking around  urlLink Woodbury Common Premium Outlet  with Deb and Jess.  Finally home at 10:30pm and going to bed... Game tomorrow at 1pm against Gingers, then on to  urlLink Fiddlesticks  (CPR's sponsor bar) for Free Keg Day... the prize for the other CPR quiz nite team (Manny, Ali E, Ali Hart, Kez and Trish).  Should prove to be a very long day.

      Never really understood this blogging thing, but my friend  urlLink Cameron   keeps raving on about it.  So, I'm giving it a shot.  Believing this to be a therapeutic and FREE means of releasing my emotions, we'll see how it goes.  It's almost 2am and I can't sleep.  I have to wake up in less than 5 hours to go play in the Goals For Life soccer tournament (benefits the  urlLink Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation )... and I can't sleep!  Damn those naps!  So to pass the time until my eyes grow heavy, I've been watching a couple of movies.  Actually, two movies at the same time.  I have movie commitment issues... A Knight's Tale and A Few Good Men were on at the same time.  So I found myself flipping between the two, which isn't a bad concept, especially since the movies weren't on any of the movie channels meaning I had to be exposed to commercials.  As soon as a commercial break began, my finger was on the "Last" button flipping to the other movie.    Now what I just did tonight and on many other occasions is very hypocritical of me, since what I do for a living is advertising.  I work for the advertising agency that puts the commercials on TV, magazines and radio.  Currently, I'm the Account Supervisor at  urlLink Cline Davis & Mann  (CDM).  Not quite sure I can say I work or worked (past tense) on  urlLink Viagra  advertising.  We just lost the account earlier this week.  Sad.  What's even more sad is that I've only been at the company 7 months!!!  At least I know that the loss of the account had nothing to do with me.  The clients were looking to go to a more traditional consumer agency, like  urlLink McCann  or  urlLink Merkely .  Not quite sure what my plans are, but I don't forsee  urlLink CDM  as my home, especially since they don't have any other consumer advertising accounts to work on.  AND because I can't stand this bitch of a woman who isn't my boss, but likes to make my life miserable as if she were.  I really need to leave.  Alright, I'm done.  I need to try the sleep thing again.

      Satan and the Tramp (aka. Paul and Judy) keep showing up at various events.  I've seen them twice in one week now.  This has got to stop!  Why does he keep insisting on trying to be friends with my friends?  Why does he keep insisting on trying to get my friends be Judy's friends?   How am I supposed to get over the relationship if I keep seeing them around?  This is absolutely ridiculous.  I can't believe how selfish he is... he doesn't give an ounce of care about how this is making me feel.  And of course, he's Satan so why should he?  ARGH!   Ex-boyfriends and their new girlfriends should be banned from coming within a 100 yard radius.
