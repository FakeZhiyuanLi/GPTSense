      I choose to do the things that I desire. I desire some things more than others. Not all things bring the same fulfillment. Different things bring different satisfaction and fulfillment. I tend to do those things that bring immediate pleasure or satisfaction. I eat cookies for breakfast. I look lustfully at an image.   Is pleasure that is immediate wrong? Is fulfillment always found in waiting for pleasure? What is the ultimate consequence of the pursuit of the immediate? I am usually left sick or wanting more. The pursuit of the immediate negates the realization of the ultimate.  If I choose lustful thoughts I give up loving relationships. If I choose cookies for breakfast I give up healthy life. If I choose sleep I give up productivity. If I choose angry words I give up forgiveness and restoration. If I choose TV I give up thinking and the developing of my mind. If I choose credit I give up thoughtful stewardship and financial freedom If I choose self I give up God.  How easy it is to choose the immediate. For every short term desire there is a long-term consequence. I cannot have them both. What do I desire more? How do I choose what is better when faced with the desire of the immediate? Understanding this does not remove the desire for the immediate. It may, however, replace it with a desire that is stronger for those things that are yet future.

      I remember my great frustration with a most of the information that I learned in school was that I could not perceive any practical way in which I might use it. This was at times an excuse to be apathetic. There did however, ring a truth to this thinking. What good is information or knowledge if it makes no difference in my life? Wisdom is living what is reality or true. Blessing comes from living according to what is true in the universe, God's created universe. The Psalmist writes, "the fool has said in his heart there is no God." (14:1). He is a fool because he has made the choice to live in God's created universe denying that there is a God. How dangerous to make up my own rules in life when I simply refuse to recognize the reality, because I do not like the restrictions it imposes. This is more obvious if you consider the natural laws of God's universe. Take gravity for instance. Who would be considered wise who jumps off of a cliff believing that gravity will not pull him quickly to the earth below. To deny God's law in this instance means death or serious injury. Could the same be true of the moral laws that God gives to us? To ignore or deny that they are true is to foolishly plummet to our own destruction.   Perhaps it is not a rebellious denial of God's truth that leads us to foolishness but a distorted understanding of it. Satan in the garden twists the words of God. Jesus calls him the father of lies. Jesus said, "I am the way and the TRUTH, and the life..." Many of us have simply believed a lie about what we consider to be truth. It is like the sci-fi movie the matrix. We live in the under the delusion of what we perceive as reality. Jesus in essence opens our eyes to the truth, which is at the same time a joyful freedom to worship the creator and a sad understanding of the reality of sin. What is the lie that Satan has sold us? 1 John 2:16 "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father but from the world, and the world is passing away..."  The lust of the eyes: This is the LIE that possessions will satisfy our hearts or bring us some kind of joy. So we pursue things, toys: cars, computers, guitars, homes, clothes, and the like hoping that happiness is coming with the next new thing. Welcome to America where we have believed that meaning and purpose is something that can be purchased. The lust of the flesh: This is the LIE that pleasure or some kind of feeling will heal our hearts. So we pursue relationships, sex, drink, drugs, health, food... We medicate our minds to the terminal pain of life. Our feelings become the navigator in on this confusing search for what matters. The boastful pride of life: This is the LIE that power or position will add fulfillment to our existence. So we become achievers in school and work. We collect awards and degrees. We pursue promotion and our existence becomes about leaving some kind of mark or memorial to what great people we were. We build monuments and write history books. We become consumed with "who's who."  All of these things appeal to the deep need for meaning and purpose in our lives. Truly Solomon said in his journal God has set eternity in our hearts. I personally desire harmony, unity, perfection, logic, continuity, beauty. These things in their perfect form are only found in God. My attempts at them always fall short. I know their must be something more, simply because I am not satisfied with what is.
