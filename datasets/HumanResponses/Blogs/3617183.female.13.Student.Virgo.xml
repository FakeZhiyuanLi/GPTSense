      i just love poetry, and writing poetry. Shel Silverstien (if i ever had one) would be my idol. alot of times i get sudden inspirations for example: this afternoon i was watching spongebob squarepants, that is how this was born  Spongebob Square  is yellow with holes sucking up water  wherever he goes  Spongebob he is a sponge you see not an eraser or not a bee  Patrick the Starfish his Pink best friend wears gren and purple with a flowery trend  Mr. Krabs is Krusty Krabs very proud owner but when it comes to his money he is not a loaner  Sandy the Squirrel now what a girl? enthusiastic from the moment she entered the undersea world  all so unique  in there own soecial ways i will always love them for all of my days  so you see? I just have a thing for peotry, even if it sucks (which this one does) its still fun to write!

      Oh my gosh I am so bored...What to do?...What to do?...My family is in the other room watching "big Fish" but I have seen that movie one too many times in that last week or so, so I came in the computer room. grrr..no one is online either, so I am just stitting here...bored as hell! with no one too talk to or nothing to do. I won 3 awards at school on friday, on for my poetry, one for math, and one for band.  I really like poetryand I have a knack for it, so my teacher syas...but I dont know. here, Ill write one here and you can decide.  Lady Fair  Once upon a time there lived a lady fair with gentle eyes'and rosy cheeks and golden locks of hair  one day she said  unto herself "my love life is askew!"  and so she searched  through all the land to find her lover true  the one who will be always there to hold her hand  through all the land  and let her know that he'll be there through thick and thin and wear and tear  however such a man is near impossible to find those kinds of men are perfect but they're only in your mind!

       wow, I just got back from Nevada. I have had such a good summer, I dont want it to ever end! But eventually..I will have to go back to school, and when the school year is over, I will be moving on to smaller and worser things.... ( I will be moving to a new city, and will be separated from all of my friends...) I really do not want to move. If I do I will be have to be apart from Kindra, my Kindra, my best friend, the sister of my soul! we know eachother inside and out, we confide our deepest darkest secrets in eachother. I dont know if there is even one thing she doesnt know about me, we even have plans for the future already. Whenever Im not at my house, I am at Kindras, Its the most sacred friendship one could have, how dare our parents separate us (she is also moving, so we will be even farther away from eachother). I have lived in this town my whole entire life, I wanted to grow up here, and graduate with all my friends. the ones I have gone to school with my for my whole primary years! I have written a poem for you Kindra (if you should come across this website some future day, but then I may have already given it to you) and I have been working on it for months, and its still not ready, just give me time and it will be perfect. I promise.    &nbsp;  (I am such a freak, lol)
