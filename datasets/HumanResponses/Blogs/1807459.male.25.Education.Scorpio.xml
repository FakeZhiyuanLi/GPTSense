      Well today was a very lazy Sunday.  I spent most of the day with my friends Serd and Jason.  Serd is not his given name, just the one we call him by.  See in middle school on the first day of some year some semester his name was misspelled on the roll sheet.  So for every class they would call "Serd Thomas" (note: his real name is Sean).  So he would have to correct the teacher every time.  And thus Serd was born.  We didn't do a whole lot.  Pretty much nerdy guy stuff.  We found a really good wrestling game for the Nintindo 64 for only $5 at a used games store a while back.  The game has an option where you can create your own wrestler so we ended up making ourselves and then beating each other up.  We later went out and got some food at a place called Zaxby's.  Had to explain exactly what kind of restaurant it is but I think Asma knows it.  I'm pretty sure there is one in Athens. Today was no good for football.  Falcons are a whopping 1-3.  Not good.  But on the up side the Braves have clinched home field.  I think this is the year, Braves all the way.   11) impecunious- lacking funds; without money 12) obviate- to anticipate and make unnecessary 13) effusive- gushing; pouring out 14) harangue- to deliver a pompous speech or tirade 15) apostate- one who deserts professed principles faith or party I think I'm going to move from vocabulary words to general trivia.  I've unearthed a trivia book in my room but it is really hard.  So I'll post a few of them just to keep you guys occupied.  If I could figure out a way to keep score I'd have a contest and then buy the winner a drink when I get back.  I'm open to ideas.  I guess I feel the need to put extra stuff on my blog b/c my life is pretty boring at the moment.  Knock yourselves out. 1) Hamlet- with 1,530 lines- is the longest speaking part in all of Shakespeare's plays.  What is the second longest? 2) What was the first name of baseball great Cy Young? 3) What part of the strawberry plant is the true fruit? 4) What was Beatle John Lennon's middle name? 5) Which U2 song is a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr.? So when I get to Korea I wonder if I will have a roommate.  I hope not.  My first roommate potato Dave was a decent enough roomy.  He was clean and respectful but for some reason decided to just not like me.  He complained about the phone ringing a lot.  I don't know.  Seems he has taken a liking to Asma.  My second roommate Megan was a nice girl but little bit on the messy side.  We always seemed to have issues with the garbage and dirty dishes etc.  But we never got in any fights and seemed to get along rather well besides that.  I really hope I get my own place just so I don't have to deal with anything or anyone.  After being at home I just want to have my own space and be left the hell alone.  I wonder how close I'll live to the subway?  I hope it is walking distance b/c I love being able to take it downtown.  Becky why can't I leave comments on your page?  Do I need to sign up with journal space?  That's the impression I get.  Whenever I click on the comments section and then it doesn't go to a comment page I get discouraged and give up.  Too much effort.  Actually I'm afraid I'll like journal space more and want to switch.  So to avoid that I just don't sign up.

      Late night blogging at its best.  My night was not so eventful.  I went to eat with by brother at Cracker Barrel and then we saw the Rundown.  Actually I have to say it was very enjoyable.  I would recommend it.  I am counting the days until my return to Korea.  It is too bad I don't know how many days to count b/c I haven't heard from Scott yet.  But the stuff should be in the mail soon.  I guess I'll probably miss the trip to Seoul next weekend but I'm sure there will be others.  I can't believe how sober I've been for so long.  I am hoping that will come to an abrupt halt once I get back.  I checked into getting my international drivers license and I think I'll go do that Monday.  I was worried there would be a test or something like that but all you have to do is show up with two passport photos and you get you license the same day.  How cool is that?  While rummaging through my closet I came across an old pair of white jeans.  They are actually in really pretty good shape and I'm thinking about bringing them to Korea.  What do you guys think about white pants?  I don't know why I have them in the first place but if they would fly anywhere it would be Korea.  I'll put it as a definite maybe.  This is the last call for people who want something.  If you want something e-mail me or leave a comment or something.  I know it is hard to think of stuff on the spot so this should give a little time to think about it.   Here are the answers for the other day. 6) vituperate- to use harsh, condemnatory language; to abuse or censure severly or abusively 7) reticent- quiet; reserved; reluctant to express thoughts and feelings 8) torpid- lethargic; sluggish; dormant 9) solicitous- concerned and attentive; eager 10) recalcitrant- obstinately defiant of authority, difficult to manage And just in case you guys wanted some more. 11) impecunious 12) obviate 13) effusive 14) harangue 15) apostate Now I will patiently wait for everyone to update their blogs about the crazy events of Saturday night so I can read them and be green with envy.  Oh how I miss the nightlife and friends who have the money and the motivation to go out and have a good time.  Again I hope this will all come to can end soon.

      Another chance to sit down and blog.  This is pretty neat actually and I'm a little sad I didn't start doing this earlier.  But hey, better late then never right?  Well trivia night at Hooters never materialized pretty much b/c my friends are bozos and chronically broke.  I miss having friends that have money and actually want to do stuff.  I've found out I really love boiled peanuts.  They are just awesome.  I've been eating a lot of them lately.  For some reason my parents have a ton of frozen peanuts and they've decided to start boiling them, so I've decided to start eating them.  Caleb did well with the vocab so I'll post the answers and some new ones.   1) salubrious- promoting health or well being 2) obdurate- unyielding, hardhearted, intractable 3) polemical- controversial, argumentative 4) pedagogy- the art or profession of training, teaching, or instructing 5) quiescence- stillness, motionless, quality of being at rest See those weren't too bad.  Here are handful more. 6) vituperate 7) reticent 8) torpid 9) solicitous 10) recalcitrant I think I'll watch the Rundown tomorrow.  That is the new movie with The Rock and Stiffler in it.  The more I see of it the more I want to see it.  I don't think it'll be great but looks entertaining none the less.  That's all for now.

      As the old saying goes "all's well that ends well."  So today or yesterday, depending on where you live, all seemed to end well between me and estranged ex-girlfriend Han Nae.  I'm still a little confused about the details myself but the beef of her problem was that I hadn't planned for her to be in my future.  By future I assume she means the long long run.  Cause I am coming back to Korea you know.  I was also relieved to find out that she isn't seeing anyone else, or so she says.  Call me naive but I do believe her.  She finally broke the ice my messaging me online, sounds a little nerdy huh?  Anyway there is no ill will and I am in a much more up beat mood.  She wants to remain "friends" but I'm not exactly sure what the Korean implication of friends is.  Guess I'll find out.  Tonight is trivia night at Hooters.  Last time I went I was the only one answering questions.  Neither of my friends I went with knew anything.  We almost won too.  So hopefully tonight will be better.  To keep you guys occupied here some words I've been studying up on to improve my vocab for the GRE.  I know I didn't know any of these before I started studying. 1) salubrious 2) obdurate 3) polemical 4) pedagogy 5) quiescence If you don't want to bother looking them up don't worry, I'll post the definitions tomorrow.  Also while I'm on the topic of English it is amazing how bad people's grammar is over here.  I thought I'd be back where people spoke English well but apparently not.  The whole good and well thing is driving me up the fucking wall.  Nobody gets it right.  Seems everyone is middle Ga. "does good."  Beats me.  I've given up and just accepted it. This is my public cry for help, does anyone know how you can get your browser to read Korean characters?  My problem is this, I keep getting e-mail from people in Korea and they always sign there name in Korean and I have no clue who it is.  I've figured out how to type Korean and I can bring up Korean web pages but from some reason when I'm in my e-mail it just doesn't work.  Any help would be appreciated.

      Well the checkup at the dentist went well today.  I guess I haven't been to the dentist in over a year but apparently I did a good job b/c he kept commenting on how "mighty fine" my teeth were.  I kinda think that b/c I was in Dublin Ga. that he gets a lot of not so "might fine" sets of teeth in there and has to deal with that.  Anyway the interesting thing is my mouth felt so much cleaner afterwards.  He said I need to floss more which, admittedly I do need to do.  I was a little under and hour drive away but since I didn't have insurance it was well worth the drive.  Everyone in Warner Robins is insured by the military so all the dentists and doctors here change a crazy amount.  Today I received mail from Scott Kim confirming that he has received my stuff all safe and sound.  He said it will take a week to process and then after which I'll be able to come back and get going.  I also got and e-mail from Gabe.  That was a pleasant unexpected surprise.  I can the comment box didn't fully explain I would like to say I don't think Andrew's blogging habits are terrible, I just wish he'd write more like everyone else.  Becky's blog is really good and interesting.  I wanna add a link to her page but I don't know her very well and I figure I'll ask later when I'm back in Korea.  I enjoy Caleb's drunken blogs a lot.  You get that drunken raw honesty thing going on which is always fun to try and make sense of.  I'm debating buying a digital camera.  The only thing holding me back is that I won't have a computer in Korea, but I'm not sure that really matters b/c you can just have them printed out like regular pictures.  That being said I've debated buying a laptop but I think I'll hold off unless I come across an absolutely amazing deal.  Ok now I'm gonna go try and tack a crack and making another web page or something.

      Ah the therapeutic goodness of blogging. I guess I really don't have a lot of interesting stuff to say but since I have even less to do I'll just talk about whatever comes to mind. First and foremost I can't wait to get back in Korea. This is the longest I've been sober since I can possibly remember. I really miss the night life and just being able to go out and do whatever til whenever. Oh those were the days, and they soon will be again, LIKE willing. I'll give a cyber shout out to Caleb who helped me clean up my site a little bit. But I did get it up and running by myself, which I am very proud of. I have enjoyed everyone else's blogs immensely. Andrew you need to blog more often. You're blogging habits are deplorable. I know this coming from someone who is just now starting a page but I plan to do a pretty good job. My brother came back yesterday from Key West Florida where he was attending some sort of combat dive school. He is in the army and going active infantry. What a nut. Unfortunately I have to get up early tomorrow to go up to Atlanta. But the cause is a good one, it will be my grandmother's 90th b-day. Man and I thought I was getting old.  On to stuff about the person who so unlovingly motivated me to finally start my sight. Still no word from Han Nae. My only real gripe is that I think I am owed a decent explanation, which has been absent as of yet. I have no problems parting with her but I do want to do it on good terms. I had a good time with her and I don't want this to taint it or damage my opinion of her. I think honesty is the best policy and I'd respect her so much more for just being up front with me. But alas she is Korean. So I've pretty much resolved to never talk to her again unless she contacts me in some way shape or form. I'm not holding my breath. So bottom line being she bowed out, but she didn't do it with grace.  In movie news I saw Underwold and Dickie Roberts. Both were pretty good. Underworld was a great geek movie. But I have to say Dickie Roberts could have been a bit better and I was expecting a little more out of it. That's all, I just wanted to end on a happier note

      Well I'd have to say I'm writing this due to some odd and somewhat sad motivation.  As most of you may know I was dating a nice Korean girl by the name of Han Nae.  Well that all came to an end last night.  I've been out of Korea for about 5 weeks now but I'm planning on returning soon.  I'd have to say over the past 2 weeks or so things have grown rather quiet between us.  I've tried to call her a few times (no answer) and even dropped her an e-mail.  Not to mention she was never online to chat or anything like that.  So I guess this was a red flag, or a few of them I guess.  Anyway last night after talking online good old Fenton House I decided to give her a call and get to the bottom of this.  Well she was at work but picked up her cell phone.  It was obvious she was less than thrilled to her from me.  Some overly awkward pleasantries were exchanged, "how are your?", "I'm find thank you, and you?"  So then I decided to jump into the hear of the matter and figure out what was going on between us, or not going on as the case seemed to be.  Note, we had been on what I would call very good terms before I left and to the best of my knowledge hadn't had any sort of falling out or arguments.  Anyway I asked her straight up if we were still "together" and if she wanted to be "together".  What I got in response was an extremely round about answer that seemed to skirt most if not all of the issues.  In the end I after all the myriad of explanations and seemingly unrelated stories and bits I was able to discern that our relationship was most defiantly over.   That being said I do have a running commentary regarding the situation.  First I will say while it does suck to be broken up with, I am much more annoyed with how she broke up with me (to be expounded upon later) rather than the fact that she didn't want to date me anymore.  If she doesn't want to be a item that's fine I can live with that, we didn't have any serious plans or anything.  And if it took me being 10,000 miles away to realize that then so be it.  But what does irk me is that I have a feeling there is someone else in the picture.  When I asked her if she was seeing someone I got one of those long eerie silences where you know nothing good can be spoken after.  Well she said she wasn't.  Gotta say I wasn't exactly convinced.  So I said "are you sure?"  Then the answer was "well I've talked to guys in the club and met some people but nothing serious."  That last sentence wasn't exactly a direct quote but I think it sums it up pretty well from what I remember.  So my point being it seemed she was hiding something.  Could I have pushed harder?  Yeah I think so.  Did I?  No, I let it go.  She'd made her decision and that is that.  The conversation was short and right to the point.  I then said goodbye.  I was paying for the call so I didn't want to waste any more money.   Afterwards I booted my computer back up and vented to Fenton who was nice enough to lend a sympathetic ear to my situation.  So here I sit in the middle of Georgia waiting to go back to Korea.  I always said I was coming back because I wanted to not b/c of her.  So I guess this is the real test to see if I will or won't.  But as plans stand I whole heartily plan on returning as soon as possible.  I'll be living in the capital of beautiful Korean women and I'll have more time and money then I'll know what to do with.  It truly is the life I miss, although I admit I will miss her some, at least for the time being.  I guess what bothers me most is that I feel I was owed a better explanation and didn't get one.  Part of it was maybe my fault for ending the conversation but it didn't seem I was going to get much more of merit then and there.  I am worried this will adversely affect my opinion of her.  I want hold her in realm of being a good decent person with some probity.  Anyway we'll see what transpires. On to different subjects now.  This is exactly a month after I started this sight.  Kinda funny huh?  Well maybe not.  I had planned to make another page somewhere else and put pictures on them but I can't find any software that I like to build a page.  I can't wait to get back to Korea.  There is a point in life where you just are not supposed to live under the same roof as your parents and I am at that point right now.  I really miss being able to do anything I want and not having to worry about money or obligations or plans or crap like that.  I really look forward to seeing the old crew, Asma, Caleb, Andrew, and Fenton and meeting all these new people that have come out of the wood work and are rumored to be cool.  Well to whoever read this thanks for reading I know it was long.

      Well I cleaned out my comment board so you guys can leave new non-offensive comments.  Last night was fun.  I stayed out late had a lot to drink and overall a good time.  To begin with I only had 4 classes which rocked.  I think everyday should be like that.  Halloween day went better then I expected.  Korean kids are really quiet when they color, and that is what we did, color.  We also played a little Halloween bingo but that was really all.  I then met Caleb downtown and we grabbed some burgers at Bennagin's which was really good.  Hit the spot just perfect.  Caleb was also sporting the crazy red chicken outfit which was just badass.  I was a priest.  A little more subtle.  The foreigners seemed to get a kick out of my costume but I think it was more or less lost on the Koreans.  We then made our way to The Commune where we met up with everyone.  Hyun Min was out.  I haven't seen him since the last time he came out to The Commune, which was like three months ago.  He cut his hair, it looked good but I think I liked it better long.  But that's just me.  A group of us then broke off and went to Bellagio.  I just had more beer.  I got to meet Mazzlar (sp?) who seems nice enough.  He keeps calling my phone looking for Asma.  We then proceeded to Gypsy Rock where cage dancing madness ensued.  Here I asked Becky for advice and then threw it out the window, maybe I should have listened.  I'll know better next time.  Oh at some point before Gypsy Rock we went to Mojo's and Bubble Bar.  Bubble Bar is a pretty happening spot.  There were a lot of hot girls there.  I just wish it wasn't so fucking loud.  I meet a lot of people last night but I don't remember any of there names.  Oh well.  I remember the name of one of Hyun Min's friends, but that is only b/c his name is the same as my Korean name.  In the end it was New Blue.  Asma, Jeff, Brian and I shared some beef rice and they had some more lemon soju.  There as some really funny stuff said but I can't remember that either.  I  wasn't that drunk, just really tired.  I keep waking up ass early b/c of the curtain situation, or lack there of.   I got home around 4:30ish maybe and just hit the sack.  I slept well but not long enough.  I think I might have to take a nap before heading out.  Andrew was supposed to have some kind of going away party but nobody has told me anything.  I heard a rumor about Outback but I don't know.  Last I heard it was still undecided.  I hope today is as easy as yesterday.  I love easy days of work.

      Well one half of the mystery commenters showed themselves.  Shiny turned out to be Caleb just having some fun at my expense.  But no hard feelings on this end.  The more I think about it I think "abouthannae" might actually be Hannae.  I did give her the address to my page a long time ago.  I wouldn't surprize me if she still read it.   I just ate a sub par pork cutlet.  It was ok and filling but nothing more.  I have to say it tasted kind of bland.  Today is Halloween and that means all kinds of Halloween craziness at school.  I'm going to meet Caleb after work and get some food.  The I should be meet up with everyone at The Commune and then roll from there.  I'm going to state I don't want to spend Halloween just hanging out in The Commune.  It is a cool place and all but we need something a little more high octane tonight.  I'm curious to see who will dress up and what everyone will be. Ok so now I get to share a crazy story about yesterday.  So if you are a regular of my blog then maybe you remember the oversexed kid I have in one of my classes.  Well yesterday he kept up with his sex related topics.  If you are squeamish you might not want to read on.  Ok so yesterday he felt the need to talk about masturbating.  He taught me the Korean word for masturbation too.  Now of course he didn't know the word "masturbation" so in order to communicate to me he had to do the typical gesture with this hand around the crotch area.  As if that wasn't enough he then attempted to show that when you masturbate you ejaculate.  This was a little scary.  When I thought it couldn't any worse it was taken to another level.  So now that he had the male system covered he went on to explain what females do.  Keep in mind this kid is probably 13 and no older then 14.  He said first they drink beer and then use a beer bottle.  The animated explanations he supplied with this were as disturbing as they were funny.  So girls who masturbate with beer bottles (and you know who you are) you secret is out and now little Korean kids know.   No Andrew has a child on roughly the same level as this kid.  In that he knows way too much at an early age.  Now his kid watches OCN late night which explains a lot.  There is some racy stuff on late at night.  Now what I don't understand is how my student knows all this shit.  He says he doesn't watch it on tv and stuff.  I'm thinking he has an older brother.  He is always telling sex stories to the other kids when it is free time.   Work did go well yesterday and I'm hoping for an easy day today.  I can't wait to get downtown and see what's going on.

      Wow yesterday drug on forever.  I need to do something about the light that starts pouring into my room around, oh I don't know 7:30.  A suggestion was made to get one of those winter caps and pull it over my eyes.  I think this has a lot of merit.  I did this last year and I'm annoyed at myself for having not brought this cap back over.  In other news tomorrow is Halloween and I'm excited.  I need to start going out in the week to break things up.  I find myself with a lot of time on my hands.  I have been doing things constructive and worthwhile like reading and studying and whatnot but I feel the need to be a little more reckless and kill some more brain cells.   In an effort to decorate the school for Halloween my manager and teachers have managed to make the school look a 4th of July party.  For those of you who don't know the 4th of July is America's Independence Day.  There are red, white and blue banners hanging from the ceiling now.  On another twisted note the other decorations look like they are for Christmas.  Whatever, I guess the kids won't know the difference, they have no clue what Halloween is.   Anyone want to see The Matrix 3 opening night?  I think I want to.  I don't think it'll be too packed.  I went on opening night when the last movie opened and there were plenty of seats.  I figure we can watch the movie and then go out afterward.

      Who is shiny?  You have some interesting commentary.   But in light of the fact that I don't know if you joking or serious I've taken down my message board.  I'm also curious as to who abouthannae is.  I think you guys should e-mail me b/c you sense of humor seems lost on me.  On to other things.  So what is the hardest part about living in Korea?  Is it not being able to speak the language?  Is it having people, who have no right to speak English, randomly come up and try to talk to you?  Is it dealing with the food?  I think I'd have to say it is finding a quality place to get a haircut.  Korean haircuts pretty much suck.  I got my haircut today and pretty much made it out of there ok.  I am always nervous that they are going to fuck something up.  The always cut so close around the ears and they do a horrible job of blending.  How many pairs of clippers does it take to get a haircut?  Today I counted four.  There where the industrial strength clippers that they used when they have to chop off a lot of hair.  Then the adjustable ones so they could cut to just the right length.  Next came the surgical clippers that were used like a fine tipped brush to add the finishing touches.  Last and definitely least where the sorriest excuse for clippers I'd seen.  It was this little thing that they used clean up the back of my neck.  Anyway I'm  glad to be away from there and happy.   I am finding my gym increasingly deficient in my weight lifting needs.  I'm too tall to use half the machines there.  This gym was not meant for foreigners.  The free weights also leave something to be desired about.  Mostly because they are barely marked and it takes half my work out to track down a pair of the same weights.  I guess on the plus side the coach isn't annoying.   I've been working on my Korean pretty hard and it is getting better.  I need more practice speaking.  I think the hardest part by far is understanding Korean.  I need someone to talk with who understands my level and will speak to me accordingly.  Every time you say something in Korean to a Korean they immediately speak back to you as fast as they can.  It just doesn't seem to occur to them to speak simply and slowly.  Oh well.  I have my Halloween costume finalized.  It is the epitome of simple. Since I don't think my roommate reads this page I'll write a little bit about him.  Apparently he is pretty good with the Korean ladies.  Not hard being a foreigner but still.  I met one of this girlfriends, I'm not sure if she is really his girlfriend but whatever.  She was really pretty.  She was younger then him but she wouldn't tell me her age.  We stayed up late drinking and talking.   I broke down last night and ate sam gyup sal by myself.  If anyone out there likes eat that also, let me know.  I need someone else to dine with.  That's all folks.

      Another day another blog.  It is getting pretty cold around these parts.  Worst yet my house is getting really cold.  Is it possible that my room could be colder than it is outside?  I think this really might be the case b/c my room is getting pretty darn chilly at nights.  I finished reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and I've moved onto The Dubliners.  I'm using my free time to catch up on classical literature.  I only have 5 classes today so I think I'll go downtown after work and get some food then hit up Seattle's and hang out for a bit.  We have a meeting today at work for what we're going to do for Halloween.  I hope we do nothing.  I think it'll be way too much trouble.  I don't want little kids running around with knifes and crap.  I figure they don't know anything about Halloween to begin with so they won't know what they're missing.  I think I'll also get a haircut tonight.  I'm not sure exactly what but I think I need a trim or some sorts.  There is somebody next to me in the PC room now screaming Korean obscenities into his phone.  Now he just hung up.  Wonder what it's about.  Wait they are calling back now.  Actually I think it is someone else sense all the swearing has stopped.   Anyway, I've decided I pretty much hate Hannae again.  She has been nothing but a real jerk since I've been back.  For the life of me I don't understand, but she is a Korean girl so that pretty much sums it up.  I hate to see a good relationship end bad but I guess that is life.  Speaking of Halloween I am looking forward to it.  I have a costume, kind of.  It is really just everyday clothes but I think it should work.  I hope other people dress up as well.  Asma said she will.  It was like yesterday that last Halloween I made the mistake of dressing up like Beckham and got the shit annoyed out of me by everyone.  Most notably was this crazy dude from Finland.  I'm defiantly shooting for something a little more subtle this time around.   I've seen two different dates for The Matrix release in Korea.  One said it was on the 6th and one said on the 5th.  Either way I can't wait.  We should organize a group and go see it.  Ok enough for now.

      This has been a much better weekend.  Friday night and last night were just good pure Daegu fun.  My night started a little slow as I was supposed to meet some people at the Commune around nine but they didn't actually show up until 10:30.  But all was forgiven as the beer drinking began.  I almost started drinking by myself but luckily I decided against it.  An hour and a half of lonely drinking would have left me rip roaring drunk.  The Commune was fun.  I met Jesus, not really, but the guy that looks like him.  It was at The Commune that I realized my voice was really really messed up from all the singing on Fri.  That sucked, there is nothing like being in a social situation with stuff to say but literally not being able to say it.  Matters only got worse as the night progress as far as my voice went.  I think it was b/c we kept going to loud places where I had to speak louder.  But voice or no voice Andy supplied me with a yo-yo that he absconded from a student and that made my night.  I haven't really yo-yoed in a long time and that was a lot of fun.  I still have the yo-yo which I plan to give back but I really thought I'd see him later on that night, but I didn't.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to hear anything Caleb said all night b/c his shirt was so loud.  It was this shiny copper shirt that ending up making for a great conversation piece.  From The Commune an ill fated effort was made to go to Mojo's, but our advanced scout Potato Dave said it was a bust.  Of course that left Gypsy Rock.  Now days I wonder which place is more happening, Gypsy Rock or the Funkaholic.   In Gypsy Rock I met up with John from Yale.  It turns out he is having some problems with his Korean girlfriend who is friends with my Korean ex-friend.  So we got to swap stories and complain.  He then went and made out with his boss who is really hot.  Geez I hope I never have to make out with Mrs. Lee.  I danced a little in the cage with Andrea.  She can really get down and boogie, me, I'm just white.  There was then an effort made to go get food.  Potato Dave thought he was eating with Asma alone, but turns out that wasn't the case and then he got mad and left.  Not shortly after I left too.  I really couldn't speak and was getting a little pooped.  I enjoyed ramen at the LG25 near my house.   Onto today.  I just got out of Once Upon a Time in Mexico.  I can't say it was good, in fact it was really pretty bad but it was entertaining.  The movie didn't make a whole lot of sense.  It was just Mexicans killing each other for about 2 hours.  I met Asma, Becky, and Brian for lunch.  We went to Fresco.  Peter showed up a little later.  Fresco get a thumbs down.  It was pricey and the serving of spaghetti I got was for a baby.  I'm fucking hungry as I type.  Maybe I'll get some hot squid rice later.  But the company was fun.  My voice still sounds like Darth Vader as Asma kindly put it.  Poor Brian, this dude has been sick since he got here and doesn't seem to be having such a good time.  I tried to give him some pointers about that part of town, hope it helps.   On a completely unrelated note I'm beginning to really hate this site called friendster.  I keep trying to log on and do stuff but it takes forever to load and do anything.  Why does this site hate me?  I'm on a different computer every time I access it so it isn't like it's an isolated event.  I did get my cell phone back from Asma along with the other goodies like the extra battery and charger.  She did some pretty cool stuff with it like program people's names and get caller ID.  Props for that, I was too lazy.

      How I missed the &#45432;&#47000;&#48169; (singing room) while I was in the States.  Last night I went to Fenton's to hang out and chill for a bit.  My original plan was to kick it for a few hours.  But as people started showing up and beer started disappearing it became clear that I was having too much fun to leave.  In the end I think we have a total of 8 people.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, fuck you and 8.  For those of you who weren't there you'd know them better as me, Meabh, Erica, Andy, Eileen, Sarah, Rob and Fenton, in that order.  We played a really hard Irish card game and I'm still debating if it made any sense or not.  That was abandoned for a different simpler game, the one where you draw a card and each card has a different game or drinking pattern associated with it.  This was great fun until landlord crashed the party again.  I worry for Fenton.  I don't think your in his good graces.  I really can't blame the guy though, we were being kind of loud and this time it was on the late side, about 1:15 if I remember correctly.  This guy wasn't joking either, the told us all to leave and hung out until we left.  At this point the singing began.  Some how I ended up running down the street carrying a bottle of wine, which I was drinking from, after someone hit the window of a BBQ place with bouncy ball.  This whole time Andrew was sweating bullets b/c it really wasn't his bouncy ball it was one of his students and if he lost it he would get in trouble.  This didn't stop others from throwing it across the street.  The singing room got a little crazy, actually a lot of crazy.  My voice is all messed up today.  As always I sung Winds of Change.  I would like to say that I've sung that every time I've been to a singing room but that wouldn't be true.  There was one time when I went before work with some people and I had to jet early with singing my favorite song.  Rob is an extremely enthusiastic singer.  I think he and I carried the show, or wrecked it depending on how you look at it.  Fenton got out of control with the cancel button and started canceling all the best shit.  Over all it was much more fun then I had bargained for and I left very satisfied. FYI- we are trying to organize a guys poker night so let me know who is interested.  We'd like to get it off the ground before Andy leaves.  It would be penny poker, or the won equivalent.  Everyone could change 20K into 500, 100 and 50's or something like that.

      Another great LIKE teacher's meeting has come and gone.  I was tricked into getting up and telling a stupid story about my youth involving memorable moments from Halloween.  I really don't like these meetings.  I put it down on my time sheet as two hours.  I did get to go to lunch afterward with the Korean teachers I used to work with at Daemyoung.  That was a lot of fun and really made my day.  They are a funny group.  We had hit up Pizza Hut of all places.  That seems to be the tradition when I dine with them.  I'm bordered on terrified about performing all these Halloween based activities for LIKE.  The Su-sung group took my idea about showing the kids movies.  I was even going to mention the Thriller video but I was beaten to the punch.  I think I'll show some non-Halloween movies that have good Halloween scenes in them.  Primo examples include E.T. and The Karate Kid.  The kids will love seeing Daniel San dress up as a shower, piss off the bullies, get his ass kicked, but only to have Mr. Miyagi come save the day.  Actually I don't think my school will do anything.  They tried to do something like this 2 years ago and it totally flopped.  I'd be happy with lessons as usual.  Guess well have to wait and see how it goes.  I should receive my cell back tomorrow so I am pretty happy about that.  I don't have a whole lot of people to call but I'm hoping that will change.  Yesterday Steve and I went up to the GS Plaza Hotel and had a few beers.  That was good bonding time with the roomy.  He seems like a really swell guy.  My room needs curtains.  Too bad the walls are made out of something that resembles cement so I'll have a hell of a time putting some nails in.  The reason it needs these curtains is b/c it gets bright really early.  I'm not a fan of that by a long shot.   I can't wait to go out this weekend.  I plan on drinking and having a good time.  But I think that is what I always plan for so I hope it will materialize.  In other news it is really awesome the subways is fixed.  Well it is almost all fixed, only one station isn't working but hey, I can live with it.

      In a rising trend I checked the death clock too and didn't do too bad for myself.  I should die on October 20 2077.  Man what am I worried about I got tons of time too go.  Granted I'll be 98 almost 99 when I die but hopefully I'll have some decent health to accompany the longevity.  If not that could suck.  I came across that sight along time ago.  I think it was the summer of 99 when I was co-oping for GA Power.  But I think I wimped out and didn't want to find out when I would kick it.  But times have changed and I don't care.  I really hate my washing machine.  What a piece of crap.  You know how most Korean washing machines have some kind of spin dry cycle at the end?  Well mine doesn't have that.  Instead it has a separate little part next to the washing machine that will do that for you.  The only catch is this.  It is a fraction of the size of the washing machine.  So for one load you'd have to run this thing like 5 or 6 times.  Next the latch on top is broken so you have to hold it down.  Then, the thing spins so fast that the washing machine moves b/c not all the legs are even.  What a pain in the ass.  Everything about my bathroom blows asshole.  Why do we have to have stupid teacher meetings every month now?  That is another pain in the ass.  We have to get up go downtown and listen to God know's who speak.  LIKE is on the decline and they keep thinking that if they put on more and more bandaids stuff will get fixed.  I don't care if they bankrupt, just as long as it is after I've left.  I have no ill will towards them but it is only business.  I do like the kids I teach but I have no love for Mr. or Mrs. Kim.  I guess I should mention I think it is the same way on the other side as well.  I just hate having to get up and go downtown for something that I consider to be extremely uninformative.

      Oh how I love to blog.  It is a shame I waited so long to start one.  First things first.  Thank you Fenton for having everyone over.  I'm sorry the crazy neighbor woman decided to try and wreck the fun, but kodos to Gabe to attempted to deal with it.  It was neat to meet all the new people who were out last night.  Things have changed but I'd defiantly say they've changed for the better.  It was also even better to see the old crew such as Asma, Andy, Fenton, Gabe and Caleb.  I was a little disappointed in myself for going home so early but I'm still getting adjusted.  I managed to stay out around 1:30ish or so.  I went to the Phunkaholic but I was too tired and too drunk to really do much more then sit around and sip on my beer.  So that was basically that.  I think I'll do better next weekend. Today went really well.  I spent a lazy afternoon downtown.  I got some good old squid rice in the super hot bowl.  That is really good shit.  I think saw Matchstick Men.  I'm still out to lunch on the final verdict but it wasn't anything outstanding.  I didn't think I would like it about 75% of the way through the movie but it did get a little better and the more I think about it, it grows on me a bit.  Next week Once Upon a Time in Mexico comes out.  I'm glad I didn't see it in the U.S. now.  I know it isn't very good but your standards in movies tend to drop when you're in Korea.  I'm just glad to have a movie I haven't seen out in the theater.  After the movie I was heading to Seattle's Best where I ran into Simon Becky and Mieka.  They were kind enough to invite me to eat with them at a Vietnamese restaurant.  I had a delightful time.  They then went to a DVD room and I went to Seattle's Best to write in my journal and read a little.  And at last here I am in the PC room typing up a storm.   On a personal note I'm not sure what to do with my hair.  I'd kind of like to grow it out some but I don't like how it looks while it is growing out.  I'll have to think on this a bit.  I also need to get a sheet for my bed.  For some reason I don't have bed sheets, only blankets.  So one of my blankets is functioning as bed sheet.

      Well here I am in the PC room again.  I think this is the PC that one of my student's mother hosts.  But I don't think that the lady here right now is her.  I find myself here b/c Scott asked me to write an article for the LIKE faces catalog or whatever you'd call it.  I'm sure you guys will have chance to tear it apart and make fun of it in the not too distant future.  Today was a good day though.  I had some really awesome classes.  It is always great when you have a class with some decent meaningful conversation.  Today we had a lesson dealing with presidents.  One of the questions in the text was "if you were president what would you do?"  There were some really good answers such as, one student said she'd reduce the school week to five days.  Another said she'd make prayer mandatory in school.  I was impressed.  On a really funny note I had to work with Dedra.  I can't believe that Michelle not only worked with her but lived with her for almost an entire year.  That is amazing.  I think one day of work was enough for me.  That is all I'll say about that.  Getting back on a more positive note the students at my school are so well behaved that it is scary.  These kids are just great.  I would say I had some good classes before but nothing like this.  I'm not sure why this is the case but I'll take it.

      I will say now that I've been able to locate a few PC bangs around where I live I'm thrilled that the trend in this part of town is to have a smoking and a no smoking section.  This is really pretty cool.  Why aren't all PC rooms like this?  I got an awesome nights sleep last night and woke up early, around 8:30 I think.  I hit the gym about 10 and then went downtown.  The gym I'm at now is a far cry from my previous on in Sangin.  As annoying and goofy as the trainers were at my last gym the place itself was pretty badass.  This place I'm going to now barely cuts it.  But it is so close to where I live and work and there is absolutely nobody there during the day so that helps make up for it.  Another big plus is the fact they have showers with warm water.  The shower in my apartment is really the saddest excuse for a means of cleaning oneself as you will ever see.  It takes forever to heat the damn water and then there is dick for water pressure.  On a positive note I did see Becky today in Seattle's best.  I also saw a teacher I worked with whose name is "Smile".  I asked her Korean name and she said again "Smile".  I'm not sure if she understood my question.  I wasn't asking what Korean people her, I was wondering what her given name was.  Maybe it really is Smile.  That would be kinda funny.   So work today dragged some serious ass.  I don't know what it was but the minutes were just not ticking away.  In my last class I had a group of five boy who were on open 5 lesson 15 (for those of you affiliated with LIKE).  Since I am the new teacher they started asking me all kinds of questions.  Then things started getting a little sketchy when one of them asked me if I liked sex.  I later found out this kid is 14, Korean 14 I think.  Of course I said no.  When I asked what his hobby was he said sex.  I then inquired how this was possible since he didn't have a girlfriend.  This is where it really gets either interesting or just scary.  He then demonstrated that he goes into restaurant bathrooms and "gets it on".  This was conveyed by him running around the room thrusting his pelvis.  He was later nice enough to tell me in only costs 50k to have sex in Japan and 35k in Korea.  Wow was I surprised.  Funny part is the kid speaks really pretty good English.   Ok guys we have to get some serious crazy this weekend.  I have two months of partying built up inside and I'm ready to let it all out.  I might have to take a little slower Friday night.  I don't want to jump all in on the first night.  I think it might be a good warm up for Saturday which is the real night out.  But we'll see.  I'm finally glad I got a chance to blog.  When I was downtown blogspot wasn't working.  Then the first PC room I went to was full.  Have you guys seen a full PC room?  It was nuts.  I got nothing more to say.

      Well here I am in Korea after some seriously long traveling.  I have to say it is really good to be back.  Currently I'm in a part of the city called Bangchon.  It is about the same distance from downtown as I was before but going the other direction on the subway.  I'm not sure how this part of town stacks up to Sangin yet.  I woke up around 6:30 and did a little more settling in and then went out for a walk.  I had to find something to eat and a PC bang to e-mail people and tell them I'm alive.  I guess I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere but I walked for nearly 30 minutes without being able to find a place eat or a PC bang.  That is nuts.  Well I finally made my way to a more developed street where I had some breakfast and I'm currently sitting in a PC bang.  My place seems nice enough.  It isn't clear yet if I'm making out better or worse then my last apartment.  On the plus side the kitchen and common area are nice.  On the down I think my room might be a just a bit smaller then before.  The bathroom really sucks.  That is my biggest gripe by far.  Something I'm still out to lunch about is my tv situation.  I have a TV a remote and cable.  But the only problem is that I can't turn the TV off with the remote, only the cable box.  While not horrible it is annoying.  Having cable is cool but now I have to relearn all the channels again.  My roommate is a guy named Stephen Powers from New Zealand.  We chit-chatted a little last night and he seems like a good guy.  I am really close to work so I'm a bit pumped about that.  I still need to find a gym.  I guess I am on somewhat of the right schedule.  I went to bed last night woke up in the morning, so all I have to do is make it through today without passing out at work.  If I can do that I think it will go a long way to getting me adjusted.  If you're reading this you probably live in Korea so come this weekend we need to go out and get crazy drunk.  Stuff has been very low key for me since I've been gone, so this needs to be remedied.  Well I'm thinking on going down to Sangin today and picking up some stuff I left behind and seeing some people at the gym I used to go to.  After that I'll just come back and try to make it through a day of work.  Hope to see all you guys soon.

      Well it is almost time for me to ship off.  It will take me about 24 hours to actually get to Deagu which is a pretty scary thought.  I have acquired most the items I've been asked ot bring back.  In my possession now are a bag of peanut butter M&M's, a bottle of Jager, a universal remote control that should work with most Toshiba models made after 1990 and a few gifts for some students.  Sorry Caleb no dark cherry jello around here for some reason or other.  What sucks is that I have to leave here around 5 in the morning.  I need to get something to help me sleep on the plane.  For some reason sleeping on planes is just not my strong point.  But on the other hand I'll be so messed up when I get to Korea it should be not problem fitting right in with the time change.

      I've been out of town the past few days so that explains why I have not been blogging.  I went to Atlanta to get my work visa and then I went to visit some family and friends.  It was a good trip.  The visa looks a little bit different this time around.  Before it was a stamp, now it's like a sticker inside my passport.  Either way it's pretty cool.  I also received my flight schedule and tickets today.  I should be arriving in Daegu about 8 pm on Monday night.  This is as good a time as any.  I have about a week to get it all together before going out on Saturday.  Needless to say I'm greatly looking forward to coming back to Korea.  On the down side I have a fairly hefty layover in Chicago.  That is gonna suck some ass.  This will only be the second time I've been to Chicago.  I'm assuming I'll be in O’Hare b/c Midway is a piece of shit.  I can't believe I've been over here this long.  I feel like I wasted a lot of time waiting for all this damn paper work to happen.  What a pain in the ass.   Tonight my brother came in.  Apparently he doesn't have work tomorrow.  So the two of us and some friends are going to head to Buffalo's and drink a little bit.  I need to get back in the habit of drinking.

      Well normally I blog at the wee hours of the morning but I have a little free time here so I'll go ahead and get it done.  Poor Braves.  Out after 5 last night.  They've played poorly and now they'll get going home.  I guess it is nothing new for them to screw up in the postseason.  I shouldn't be so annoyed.  I'm sure there are people who would love to be as disappointed as I am.   Tomorrow I'm going up to Atlanta to get my visa.  All my documents showed up today so I should be on my way back to Korea come Friday or Saturday.  I'm dreading the flight back over but I'm so looking forward to getting back.  I'll also have to say some last minute hellos and goodbyes tomorrow.  I need to see my grandparents again and I have an aunt and uncle I need to go see.  Anyway tonight is trivia night at Hooters.  I think we are just going there to drink.  The trivia is pretty lame and deals with everything redneck.  But seeing as how I grew up here I'm able to hold my own.  Wish me luck.

      Well not much new.  I found out Michelle's site isn't dead instead it is alive and well.  For some reason I thought it was done for.  Needless to say I'm very happy it isn't b/c now I have something else to read in my hours and hours of free time.  Here is a little something to do for you guys.  Go to google and put in "weapons of mass distruction" and then hit I'm feeling lucky or whatever that button is.  Then read the error message.  Pretty funny stuff if you ask me.  Braves managed to live another day.  They'll have game 5 tomorrow back at the Ted.  I really hope they can pull it out but I'm a little worried.  An Dee Roo Koon Koon Da I'm sorry your team wasn't so lucky today.  But there were some really good plays and it turned out to be an awesome game.  I bit the inside of my cheek really hard today while I was chewing bubble gum.  That's all.

      Wow the unexpected joy of reading people's blogs while they are partying away in Seoul.  I was sure I would have to wait until Monday or Tuesday to read about the crazy Birthday happenings in the capital of Korea.  But as luck my have it my computer savvy friends found the time to write while they are there.  How great is that?  Guess it shows how crazy I'm going being stuck here?  Well I checked the FedEx tracking number Scott gave me and he definitely sent it but looks like it will get here Monday or Tuesday.  Not too shabby.  Poor Braves, lost again.  The Cubs pitching is killing them.  I'm waiting for them to whip out the whoop ass but instead I'm settling for them get beat.  Answer time. 1) $1.19 you figure out the change 2) The noble prize 3) St. Louis 1904 4) 5- St. Louis, Mexico City, L.A., Atlanta and Montreal   Georgia National Fair is in town but I think I'll skip out.  Same old stuff from when I was a kid.  I really don't like any of the rides and I'm of the age I realize I'm not going to win anything even close to the dollar I'd have to pay to try, so I'll just cop out.

      One thing I love about October is postseason baseball.  I think the reason for it is that the Braves are always in the playoffs, at least to start with.  Things are looking ok so far.  They split the series with the Cubs at home.  The next game is Friday at Chicago.  But the Braves are actually a better road team then a home team.  I guess that is why San Fran didn't want to bother making up a game on Monday.  SanFrandy I guess our teams are now more or less in the same boat.  I'm surprised at how well the Marlins have played.  Those crazy fish, can't count them out I guess.   Today I received an e-mail from Scott saying that my documents are on the way and he even gave me a tracking number to boot.  So as it stands I'm looking at being over there around Friday or Saturday.  While at the bookstore today I noticed a new South Korea book so I decided I'd check it out and see what they had about Daegu.  I was a little disappointed.  For the third biggest city in Korea you think they'd have a little more to write about, but I guess not.  I was hoping I could make this trip to Seoul this weekend but I guess not.  Happy B-day anyway Becky.  I'm sorry you seem so sad as of late.  Worry not, things will get better.  Because I have nothing more interesting to say, here is some trivia. 1) What is the largest amount of American currency one can hold and not have change for a dollar? 2) What famous medal depicts three naked men with their hands on each other's shoulders? 3) What was the first city to host the Summer Olympics in North America? 4) How many cities have hosted the Summer Olympics and what are they?

      This is by far the hardest part of keeping a blog over here, writing when there is really not a whole lot to write about.  I did have a somewhat eventful day by middle Georgia standards.  I had to go to Macon, which is about 20 min North.  I went and got my international drivers license and I signed up to take the GRE on Monday.  Well the international drivers license thing was cake.  All you needed were to passport size photos and $10 and you're good to go.  You have to fill out a really short form and that's all.  I was expecting some kind of test or a lot of paper work or something but as it turned out I walked in and walked out.  It is only good for a year but hell for $10 who cares.  I really don't have anything to drive but I am thinking of getting something if I can find it cheap.  I think it might come in handy sometimes.  Not so much for when I go out b/c I usually get pretty drunk but for getting around and stuff it might not be bad.  No feed back on the white pants so I guess I'll bring them.  Scott mailed me today and said he has gotten all the paper work and will mail it to me tomorrow.  That is about all I'm waiting on.  Once I get that it's a quick run to get the visa and then I jump on the plane.  Seems to easy, something has to go wrong between now and then.  I'm tired, it's pretty late over here.  Here are the answers to the questions in case anyone cared.  I'll post more questions later.   1) Richard III 2) Denton, he was nicknamed Cy- for Cyclone- b/c of his fastball 3) the seed, the big red thing we eat is called the bulb. 4) Winston- after Winston Churchill 5) Pride (in the name of love)

      I've had a good day.  I've decided to clear up some issues and get the ball rolling.  I decided to change the title of my blog as I think I'm a little more apt to be wild these days.  Stuff is going well.  I fell really good despite having been up since 3am.  We had a teachers meeting this morning.  I presented and received 20K for my efforts.  I talked about the games I like to play at school, kinda fun.  Lunch was pretty darn good.  We ate at my house restaurant which is around where I used to live but for whatever reason I never went there.  I was buffet with all kinds of goodies including turkey, mashed potatoes, and apple pie.  I think I'm going crazy from lack of sleep.  Screw it I'll sleep tonight, or maybe I won't, I don't know.  Fenton is loaded with games to play on his comp and I'm so ready to test them out.  That will be Sat. night.  This weekend should be good.

      So I had this great idea last night, that I'd just go home and go to sleep.  Well I did just that and I was out like a light at around 12.  This was all and good until I woke up at 3 and have been up ever since.  Today is going to be hell.  I feel fine now but I'll be dragging ass later.  I hear we are going to get treated to a lunch somewhere by our boss, I wonder where.  Happy T-day everyone.  I really hope we get some turkey.  I could go for some mashed potatoes too but hey we're in Korea.  I like being up early in the morning, but I guess not enough to wake up this early regularly.  I'm looking forward to the weekend.  Actually I'm really looking to work being over even that is only 12 hours away.  I just to lay down and get some good sound sleep.  I probably should have gone to the gym this morning but I kept trying to  go back to sleep.  I am surprised at how many people there are here at this time in the morning.  I guess most of these guys have been here from the night before and have been here awhile.  Hell I don't I know.  Time to play some games or something.

      The date went well in that I had a good time.  But I couldn't be more different from this girl if I tried.  Her English was really good I'll say that.  She is as close to a Korean hippie as I have ever seen.  I project 0 future.  Oh well I'll live.  There is a possibility that some people have wondered onto my page that I had not intended to read my page.  Again, oh well.  As is turns out my site is linked to Asma's, which has turned out to be more popular than first imagined, in that everyone in the dorms reads it.  I  got a good laugh out of hearing this.  I ate lunch downtown with a teacher I used to work with.  She is really cool and we had a good time.  Pizza Hut seems to be the tradition and again we ate there today.  I'm really tired.  I've been trying to go to bed early but all attempts have failed.  I fucking lost my hat in the market and now I need to get another.  FUCK!  I really liked that hat.  Again oh well.  I'll survive, at least until I can get another hat.  I have to speak on Thursday and still haven't bothered putting together my hand out.  I might do that tomorrow.  I only have to talk about games I play in class so that shouldn't be hard.  I'm going to bed.

      I just finished writing my first e-mail in Korean.  It really wasn't that bad.  I think I'll pick up typing in Korean pretty easy.  Today after work I walked my a lady urinating in an ally.  Guess it isn't everyday that happens.  I had a meeting downtown today b/c I'm presenting on Thursday.  Hey get ready guys, ain't no Thanksgiving lunch for us at Camp Walker.  Yeah so that got canned.  The meeting was pretty much stupid.  I can't believe I had to come all the way downtown for something that took literally 5 minutes.  After the meeting Hee-Dal was nice enough to take Asma, potato Dave and myself to lunch.  We went to a really swank little joint.  Next time I have a date I think it'll take her there.  It isn't that expensive and it is really nice.  I think the name was Xanadu's or something to that effect.   In the gym tonight I got to listen to the Korean remix of Stevie Wonder's "Part Time Lover."  Wrong in so many ways.  My room is so damn cold I just don't understand.  Is it really possible for it to be colder in my room then it is outside?  My roommate doesn't seem to want to turn the heater on since he has a space heater.  Well we talked and I confessed to freezing my ass off so I think we'll turn the heat on.  Oh to make things better the controls to the heat are in his room.  It took me forever to get to sleep last night  for some reason.  Part of it was my feet being cold.  But four pairs of socks later and that was remedied.   I can't see my tagboard but I did clean it up last time I was in a pc room where I could.  Hope it stays that way.   While I was downtown I detoured out of my normal route to the subway so that I might enjoy a McDonald's icecream cone.  As you may or may not know Micky D's has upped the price of their soft ice cream cones to 500W (about 45 cents U.S.).  Now Lotteria on the other hand has them for 300W (about 25 cents U.S.) a pop.  I've come to the conclusion, being the connoisseur of ice cream cones that I am, that Micky D's is worth the extra money.  Anyways while I was getting my precious ice cream there was some kind of concert going on in the "heart" of downtown which consisted of a Korean singing "You give love a bad name" by Bon Jovi.  This could have possibly been the worst singing I've ever heard.  I don't claim to sing well, even though I enjoy the singing room as much as the next person, but damn this was horrible.  The words weren't even close to right.  Oh well, it wasn't like anyone else cared or noticed.  I'm tired.  I think I'll call it a night and read some.

      Wow last night was crazy and I feel I have a lot to blog about.  Maybe it isn't really that much but anyway.  First I remembered what I wanted to say about Friday night.  The incidents I couldn't think of involved getting pierced and Gabe getting hit by a car.  First the piercing, as it did chronologically come first too.  I think it was my bright idea to go get several piercings for some odd reason.  At one point it was going to be me, Rob, Gabe and Caleb.  Others might have been involved, I'm not sure.  I was going to get both nipples, my navel and my eyebrow done.  Thank God the place was closed b/c I think I would have done it.  Now that I'm sober I'm not so sure about it all.  Needless to say I was well over the edge thanks to alcohol.  Next, we were standing outside of Gypsy Rock and this car rode by and tagged Gabe.  Gabe then hit the window, opened the door and started yelling at the driver.  In and effort to diffuse the situation I picked up Gabe from behind (remember I'm very drunk at this time) and tried to carry him away, seeing as how we really didn't want the situation to escalate.  Instead of this, when I stepped back I caught the curb and we wiped out.  At this time the car drove away.  So I guess it kind of worked. Last night was Korean Lois's birthday party.  We started at Bennigan's where over half the table ordered hamburgers (myself included).  But I have to say it was a really good hamburger.  I had only had cereal and some O-deng all day.  I literally woke up ate some cereal and went to work.  So we finally got our food and I fucking killed that burger.  Next was Itaewon.  I don't really like this place.  I think it's pretty lame.  There was never enough beer and you can't get up and walk about.  We had a lot of people out, too many to name.  I sat next to a Korean whose nick name is Obi-won, because he is training to be a Jedi Knight or something.  Actually his Korean name sounds a lot like Obi-won and thus he is now Obi-won.  His English is pretty darn awesome but he talks like no tomorrow.  I kinda wish either, he didn't speak English, or I didn't understand it.  But he is cool, I just felt a little trapped.  I debated drinking beer again but eventually gave in.  Fenton and I swapped our favorite moments in wrestling.  Also poker night was discussed.  Rob is itching to play and so am I.  The plan is for next Sunday, say maybe 10ish or so.  Actually I'm free any night so just let me know.  We finally left the place and went to Gypsy Rock.  What the hell happened to upstairs Gypsy Rock?  I think someone was smoking crack when the made plans for it.  Now it has a dance floor nowhere to sit and no draft beer?  What good is that?  Also I got crazy and wore my white pants which haven't seen the light of day in I don't even know how long.  Actually I don't think anyone noticed or cared.  Asma was the only person who said anything, and that was just acknowledging that I had them on.  Along with the pants was the shirt Caleb gave me.  Thank you again.  I think they went well together.  I need to drink more before Gypsy Rock (GR) and less in GR.  Beers for 5k a pop will whipe you out real quick.  I think I spent about  30-35K on bottled beer.  Ouch! I ended up giving my digits out to a girl I met last night.  See was cute but here English wasn't that good.  I didn't expect to hear from her really but as fate would have it she has already e-mailed me.  But she lives a long way a way and I think she has pretty much exhausted all her English.  So not much doing. At bubble bar, which came next, Fenton got all kinds of crazy and started the most violent dancing I think I've ever seen in Daegu.  It started in GR but peaked here I think.  At some point he lost his glasses and kept saying that he didn't care.  There was some girl who looked like a tranvestite (sp?) who kept pushing him and being a real jerk.  I think she might have had something to do with the glasses disappearing, but that is just speculation.   Oh cool that girl just sent me text message telling me she sent me an e-mail.  Koreans are so funny.   Back to Bubble Bar (BB, I hate typing the names over and over).  I saw ê¸¸ì„ , who used to date John from Yale, who I also saw earlier.  She seemed well and happy to see me.  ìˆ˜ë‚˜was also there but I see her more often.  They are really cool.  I finally called it a night after running out of cash and then putting drinks on the card.  I'm probably forgetting to write something else really interesting but if it comes to me later I'll me sure to blog.   Sunday peaceful Sunday.  I used to get all crazy and want to travel on Sundays, but now I'm cool with jus kicking it downtown and catching a flick or something.  I woke up fairly early and couldn't go back to bed for whatever reason.

      Who was really really drunk last night?  Well there are a lot of answers but my point is that my name is definitely one of them.  Last night turned out great.  I was late like bitch but after that stuff flew smoothly.  We ate some pork at WABA and then hung out at the Commune where we had some beer and icecream cake.  That icecream cake was awesome.  Whoever's idea that was needs a pat on the back.  I was Neapolitan and went great with the beer.  Odd combination but it worked.  We were there for awhile mingling b/c there were so many foreigners there.  We finally made it to Gypsy Rock where more drinking was had and I ran into John and Brad.  I like these dudes but haven't seen them in forever since their number changed and I can't ever get in touch with them.  We closed that place down and moved to Bubble Bar.  It was there that I realized I was pretty much done for and had to bail.  That is an overview of the night.   I would like to publicly thank all those who gave me presents.  Caleb thank you for the shirt.  You will see it in action tonight.  Hopefully it will bring me some good luck.  Gabe and K-Lo thank you for the wine and calculator.  Asma, I always like Absolute and I'll have a blast with it.  And Andrea thank you so much for the gift certificate.  It will be put to good use.  I'd also like to say thanks again to everyone who came out and just made it a fun evening.  I fee like I've won an award and this is like my acceptance speech or something.   I'm not sure if anything really crazy happened.  Nothing particular comes to mind.  I slept fairly well and I'm feeling pretty good so I think I'll be able to go hard again tonight.  This morning, well afternoon when I woke up I wasn't so sure.  Today is K-Lo's birthday party celebration.  Dinner at Bennagin's should be fun.  After that, who knows.   I don't feel much older.  I think this is b/c I've been calling myself 25 for the past year do to the screwy method of assessing one's age they seem to have in Korea.   I've had to work with Judy the past two days and I've come to the conclusion that she is just a negative person.  She is always complaining and then she doesn't approach people very diplomatically when trying to resolve a problem.  She just seems lazy.   In embarrassing news when I woke up around 10ish to go to the bathroom (I wasn't completely sober at this point) I opened the door on my roommate who was taking a  shower.  Don't worry I didn't see anything and I don't think it was that awkward.  I had my earplugs in and couldn't hear the water running.  But I still think he should have locked the door.   Sarah said she has started reading my blog and that she found it refreshing as just started to read it.  That makes me a little bit happy I guess.   I feel like there was something else I wanted to talk about but I guess not, or at least I can't remember.

      The birthday is tomorrow but I'm not too pumped up.  I had a really rocking birthday last year so I don't feel the need for one this year.  But think it will still be pretty wild seeing as how it is a joint party with Caleb and he is inviting a lot of people.  I don't know why I feel this way but I just do.  Maybe it is b/c I'm turning 25.  I guess I can rent a car now.  But really, where does the time go?  Who knows.   In good news for me I've gotten off my ass and decided to do something about being single.  I have a date for Tuesday night.  We'll see how that goes.  She is pretty and speaks English so that is at least a start.  If I never write about this again you'll know it went to hell.   I have been swapping English for Korean lessons at work with one of the teachers.  So far I'm very pleased.  It is good to have someone to motivate you.   I've been drinking a lot lately it seems.  These two consecutive days of sobriety are doing me some good.  But that should come to an end oh, say tomorrow night.   I have been told my message board is still out of control.  I think I'll delete it one of these days.   I am hoping tomorrow will be fun.  For anyone who doesn't know we are meeting at WABA at 10.   I'm tired and don't feel like writing more.  Where do they fucking sell bed sheets in Korea?

      I'm tired and really don't have much to type about.  I was in a really good mood today.  I think it was in part due to a good nights sleep.  I think I'll try and get to bed at a decent hour again.  I think I'm at the part in my book that gets cut out in the abridged version.  I'm 450 in with 1000 left to go.  Jeez what the hell could take up that many pages?  I don't know.  I'm pumped about eating some pork tomorrow with Fenton and crew.  I think other people might be downtown too and drinking might happen.  We'll see I guess.  Details on Seoul are still unclear.  I might post on them later or maybe not.  This Friday is my b-day so I'm pumped.  I can't believe I'll be 25.  That is just a little crazy.

      What happened Saturday night Seoul?  I was there but sure as hell don't know.  There was drinking and drama.  Luckily I don't think I was involved in the later.  At least that is my impression to this point.  There was mission that was failed by all involved but most horribly so by myself.  Hoping to figure out the details later I'll just go with  what I know, which is first a foremost, that there are a lot of damn foreigners in Itaewon.  We went to Gecko's and two other clubs and there were just whities everywhere.  The last club was particularly awesome.  Unfortunately my left contact was fucking killing me and of course I left my case at the hotel.  So today my eye looks bloodshot and pretty much just nasty.  In an unexpected but positive turn of events Caleb, Gabe and Lois (aka Lo-Lo, K-Lo) flew up from Daegu to partake in the Seoul nightlife.   The day went well also.  Asma, Brian and I went around and visited some palaces and temples.  This was good in that I feel I've really seen a great deal of Seoul.  There are things I'd still like to do but nothing pressing.  I'd just like to hang out and soak it all up now.  I'm going to complain about how Koreans seem to measure height.  If you've heard this story feel free to skip ahead.  As I mentioned I went to the 63 building yesterday.  They call it the "63 building" b/c it has 63 floors.  Well not really.  It has 60 floors and 3 basements.  What kinda crap is that?  Seoul tower is also not the third largest tower in the world by a long shot.  It is simply the third highest above sea level b/c it is sitting on mountain.  Koreans, go figure.  Back to Seoul happenings.  We had a really nice buffet dinner on Saturday night at Jeff's hotel.  Which I'll say that was a pretty posh spot.  While the dinner was great we paid out the ass for it to the tune of about $34.  Apart from the company and food we had a nice view of City hall and the center of town, if Seoul really has a center.   Now just some random thoughts.  Gumi James needs to learn to set his phone to vibrate b/c he never picks it up.  That or he should give the phone to someone.  Becky seemed to have a good time in China.  I told her she would have fun and she did so that makes me feel all well.  The place we stayed was pretty clean and had the best porn I've ever seen in Yagwon.  Plans are to eat WABA for dinner at 10:00 Friday for Caleb and my birthdays.  Why do Koreans remember your b-day so well.  I've had so many Koreans I knew from last year remember my b-day to the day and ask me about it.  Crazy.   Nothing to write about today really.  I just came back to Daegu.  I saw Jumi for the first time in a long time for those of you who know here.  I wonder if she still eats entire birds while out on the town.  I think I'm losing focus now.  I'm tired from two nights of sleeping on the floor.  I'm sure I have more to say but I'll do that later.  Time to see what everyone else is writing about.

      I'm in Seoul now.  It has been a fun night.  I couldn't go to Suwon b/c there wasn't a bus from the express bus terminal that left to go there.  Anyway I went to the 63 building today and took a cruise down the Han river.  After that I met up with Asma and Brian in Sin ch'on.  We then went off to see Jeff and his cousin Megan who are staying at a nice ass hotel.  After that we headed out and drank a little but nothing crazy.  I think we are saving the craziness for tomorrow night.   I'm unclear as to what Andrew is accusing me off on his blog.   Maybe we will find out.  I left a comment related to the statement.  Anyway I hate Seoul traffic.  Too many cars and people. Tomorrow Caleb and the Guminator should come up.  I think tomorrow should  be a good time.  Apparently we are eating a vegetarian dinner.  To hell with this I'm done.

      Ok well it seems like the blog is finally working now.  I don't have much to say but I have time to kill here so I'll just type away.  I'll start off with the mildly amusing stories of my crazy students who always talk about sex.  Today he let me know that he doesn't want women to give him oral sex b/c he is afraid that they might bite it off.  Smart kid.  He also talked about how big Becky's boobs are.  I guess Becky has taught that class before.   My plan is go get some decent sleep tonight and head to Suwon tomorrow and then from there to head into Seoul.  I'm not sure if there is a serial killer running around Seoul anymore.  I asked one of my teachers today if there was.  She said she wasn't sure but that there were many people in Seoul.  Well duh, I knew that.  I gotta pack.  I think I'll only bring one change of clothes.  I just plan to get up and pretty much go home on Sunday so there is no need to look pretty. I've got to go home and pack.  I wanted to do some laundry but there just isn't any time.  I think I'll just read myself to sleep.  I'm actually looking forward to the bus ride so I can have around 3 hrs to just sit around and read my book and study.  Geez I'm a nerd.  Too bed with me.

      Ok this is my first drunken blog but I'm going to try and keep things under control.  I'd like to say that the Hotel Ariana rocks my face off.  This place makes their own beer and has a pretty darn good live band.  I say this b/c they sung "winds of change tonight".  They did well but I could have done better.  I somehow ended up there and drank a lot of beer.  So now I find myself in a pc room b/c I don't want to go home drunk.  The hotel was really awesome, there were a ton of people there for a Wednesday night. Ok my tagboard is a little out of control.  I'm at a different pc room and I can read it now.  I'm going to ask that people keep stuff to at least and R rating.  I think I made the mistake of giving this page to some friends back home who have started to abuse the tagboard.   Today was long and boring.  I had a rough day by LIKE standards.  Which really means I didn't do much I just didn't enjoy myself.   I'm looking forward to my B-day is about a week.  That should be some crazy fun.   I was hoping to call Asma tonight and see what the deal was with Seoul but I guess I'll call her tomorrow.  Gabe did you ever get in touch with her?  Becky is in China now I guess doing the Great Wall thing.  I'm a little jealous even thought I've already been.   Ok fuck it I'm going to play some games.

      I was just informed of some unfortunate news.  A girl I used to go to school with was just in a serious car crash in the Miami area.  On a really strange note, she is the current Miss Florida and I used to help her with math in highschool.  I haven't seen her since my freshman year in college but I hope all is well.   The Count of Monte Cristo is a really good book.  I'm not a particularity avid reader but I find that I can't put the book down and I'm reading it out of control.  For some reason I really like revenge stories.  I don't know why, I don't feel the need to get any one back.  Either way it makes for a good read and I suggest it to all and you're more then welcome to borrow it when I'm done.   Today was peppero day which was good.  I got a lot of it but none of the kind I really like.  I like the real stuff not the cheap imitation crap.  Everyone seemed to have the single long big sticks of it and none of the packs of the real stuff.  Oh well.  It was  good day but last year was better b/c I'd taught my kids longer and I was the only foreign teacher.  I was thinking today about what an ingenious idea peppero day is.  Someone working for peppero was like "lets make our own day for peppero day!"  Man I bet he is mega rich now.  Have you guys seen the displays of peppero downtown in front of the department stores?  Enough said. I had to forcibly throw a kid out of class today.  He kept pushing the envelope and got the boot.  The good thing he seemed get the point after he was ousted, and so did the rest of the kids.  I was in a really good mood today but for some reason I had no patience with the kids that like to screw around.  Ok I'm meeting the roomy for some beers across the street.

      I love this bugsmusic site.  It is loaded with  everything you'd want to listen too despite being a Korean run site.  As a matter of fact I'm listening to it right now.  Yesterday was a peaceful recovery from the fierce night of drinking that was Saturday.  I finished up The Dubliners and picked up The Count of Monte Cristo at Kyobo.  I am surprized at what an easy read it is.  I'm a little worried about the fact that it's about 1500 pages long because I've never read anything nearly this long before.   It looks like I'll be going to Seoul this 3 day weekend.  This will be my 4th trip to Seoul.  There is still plenty I have to see.  I'd like to finish up seeing all the royal palaces and there are a handful of museums to had as well.  I forgot to ask my Korean teachers today but I heard there is some kind of killer who has been running around the part of Seoul I usually find myself in.  But this time I think we'll be in a different part luckily.   I had to work at Samduk today, but actually it turned out to be a real  treat.  All my classes were super easy.  I got this guy Justin's schedule, and I don't know what he does to these kids but they  were super well behaved.  I think hung out downtown and read in Seattle's.   Life is pretty tame otherwise.  I'm finding my rhythm here in Banchon which is good.  I think I'm ready to meet and date someone again.  Being single has been nice but I do miss having someone.  My birthday (as well as Caleb's) is quickly approaching.  It makes me wonder where the hell the time goes.  I remember it last year very vividly.  It was actually a rocking party with more people than I count partaking.  This year I don't think I want something so grand.  Just some fun.  I've only barely managed to start filling the Slamma bottle that was given to me last year with change despite having it for a year.   Today was pay day but I didn't get squat b/c I was at Samduk.  But hopefully that will be remedied tomorrow.  I still need to open a damn KB star bank account but when I went downtown to do it the secretary (they call them counselors now for some reason) drew a fucked up map that led me to nothing that resembled a bank.  I guess it really isn't that important.  I just want to get an atm card.  I think I want to eat Sam gyup sal soon.  Fenton if you read this and want to eat some sam gyup sal tomorrow let me know.  Give my cell a call after work b/c I think I'll head downtown to head it and hang out.  Or for that matter anyone who wants to eat it let me know.  He just seems to be the only other person who likes it.   Seems to be lots of drama lately in the ever widening circle of friends.  Luckily I think I'm not included currently.  Everyone should go to Seoul this weekend.

      I wanted to blog but the keyboard I'm on is pretty crappy so we'll see how this goes.  Friday and Saturday nights were fun.  Lots of alcohol was consumed.  Friday we hit up BOOM which was badass.  The weather was great and the beer was plenty cold.  We then ended up in Bubble Bar.  Before that Becky, Asma and I had a drink at Bellagio.  It was all good until they went on a 30 long cocktail show.  We told Connan that Megan and Michelle used to like him.  I'm not sure he understood.  He might have just thought I was saying he is handsome.  There was more drinking and some dancing at Bubble Bar then it was a night.  It is good to have someone to split a cab home with now, thank you Becky.   Saturday was good fun.  After work I hit the PC room with some of my students and I beat up on them in Counter Strike.  They tried hard but I kicked their ass.  Seeing as how they're half my age I guess I shouldn't be so proud.  I then went to try and get my hair repaired.  At first it looked like it was going to be a disaster but as it turns out I'm pretty happy with it.  I love how cheap it is to get your haircut here.   Next was downtown.  Man we have to find another place to meet besides The Commune.  It is nice but damn like every night we are there.  We were there a while last night  but when we rounded everyone up we headed to Jazz on Jazz for whatever reason.  Johnny English doesn't talk.  From there we went to Gypsy Rock.  It pretty happening.  I got dumped on my Eilleen and Gumi James.  First Gumi James passed off some girl from South Dakota to me.  He was trying to get away but in a strange twist of fate I think they might have met again, in fact I'm pretty sure they did.  I'll keep my opinion to myself.  Eilleen in an attempt to get away from someone said I was her boyfriend and ranaway.  This turned out to be a Korean soldier who spoke awesome English and talked my ear off.  We went to Bubble Bar after and nothing major was going on there so we hit up New Blue.  At this point it was Asma, Eilleen, myself and someone named Digger.  I wonder if that is his given name.  He actually seemed pretty cool and maybe I'll get a scooter from him.  I don't know where I'll drive but I just want one.  This keyboard ain't too bad I guess.  Been talking on MSN so I'll have to write more later.

      Wow looks like I hit a nerve with an overly sensitive individual that I won't name.  Too bad for him.  But if you'd like to find out who and how mad he is just click  urlLink here .   Well tonight is a hot bowl squid rice night.  I'll be meeting Asma and possibly other to enjoy the warm goodness of squid rice.  It is so good when it is it cold outside.  Afterwards we'll head out and see what his happening downtown.  I am excited.  I'm in a mood to go out and have fun.  I'd like to hit some places besides The Commune for a change.  As nice as it is we always seem to be there.  These days Bubble Bar seems to really be happening.  Last night I got a pretty good nights sleep.  The hat that I invested in is paying big dividends in the form of good sleep.  It is still loud as hell around my place due to the airforce base and the crazy people trying to sell veggies and fruits at like 8 in the a.m.   I wonder if any new movies came out today?  I hope so.  I enjoy watching movies on Sunday afternoon but I don't want to see The Matrix 3 again, at least not yet.   I've been on a run of good luck at the gym lately.  For some reason OCN and Super Action channels have been showing really good movies in the morning.  This makes the kilometers on the  treadmill and cycle go by much faster.  Today was The Shawshank Redemption.  Can you really believe that lost best picture to Forest Gump.  Tough call.  It is also good practice for my Korean since it is all in subtitles.  Also this week they had MIB, Mortal Kombat and something else that I can't remember.  Off to teach the little Korean kids more English.  Until next time.

      Here to blog again.  I got caught up earlier talking on msn and then had to meet Scott and hit up immigration.  Come to find out I live just down the street from the immigration office.  So if ever you guys have stuff take care of over in this neck of the woods let me know and we'll do lunch.   On to last night.  It basically consisted of dinner and The Matrix.  Dinner was bbq with Caleb and Asma.  We later met Gabe and K-Lo at the theater.  We had to get tickets for the 11:30 showing but that turned well b/c 11:00 would have been way too early.  So about the movie.  It wasn't great, but it was good enough.  I guess I am still out a to lunch a little.  I was seriously annoyed by the fact that the movie was horribly out of frame.  This was compounded by the fact that nobody cared and I couldn't do anything about it.  This bothered the living shit out me.  But I think I was able to see past it and still enjoy the movie.  To be blunt I feel that there wasn't enough substance there.  The action and special effects took center stage and that was it.  I don't think the martial arts fights were anything too impressive either.  Really nothing was explained and I'm pretty much as confused now as I was going in.  There were almost definitely be another movie.  The ending did leave a lot to be desired.  WARNING: Do not read on if you have not seen The Matrix Revolutions   Now I am going to vent about stuff in the movie that would possibly spoil the ending and other plot twists.  So how in the world can Neo see without eyes?  I can kind of get past that but there is so much that was left in the air.  The ending is by far my biggest complaint.  Ok Neo loses and gets turned into an Agent Smith.  Then the explodes, then all the Agent Smiths explode.  What?  I could have thought up a better ending then that.  The dialogue was to say the least, tedious.  There were some cool people didn't get nearly enough time and some duds who got way too much.  I feel like they only threw money at the movie and not a lot of effort.  It was so heavily drugged with special effects I was numb at the end.  Trinity died too (it is assumed Neo died when he blew up), but oddly enough I didn't really care.   I'm not sure which was better, or worse for that matter, 2 or 3.  But like I said I didn't hate it.  I just wish it had a better ending.  All three of these movies lead up to this epic battle scene which wasn't all that epic.   OK you can read again now.  We had a few beers at The Commune after.  Becky was also hanging out there.  Gabe liked the movie well enough, but Caleb didn't.   I am looking forward to this weekend.  No reason in particular I just want to go out and have some fun.  Last Saturday was fun but tame.  I'd like to cut loose but getting people to get crazy always seems to be the exception and not the rule.  Too bad.  I had a class today where I had to teach the numbers and alphabet.  Wow talk about the longest 45 minutes in the history of time.  When we going to play poker again?  I want to drink soju.  I'm tired.

      I have been informed that there are some interesting posts going on in my comment section.  I can neither see them nor do anything about it.  But whatever I don't care, I'll eventually find a computer that will let me read them.  So have fun until then.  Shit I was going to blog but got caught up talking online.  I'll blog later tonight I think.  I have to talk about The Matrix and stuff.

      I am all pumped up to see Matrix: Revolutions tomorrow.  So I decided to start reading online reviews.  Not a good idea.  The critics are tearing it apart.  But still I know I will enjoy it.  The plan is to meet and eat bbq and then hit the movie.  After the movie hopefully there will be a lot of drinking involved.  I guess I really don't have a whole lot to say.  I chilled out downtown a tonight.  Nothing special just got some food and sat in Seattle's for a bit.  Oh I did get a winter hat that I will be able to pull over my eyes so I won't be waking up at the ass crack of dawn all the time.  I've still got to go to immigration at some point.  No doubt Scott has forgotten.  I should call him or something.  I don't want to find out what happens if I don't get my card within 90 days.  Granted I do have a fair amount of time until then but best to get it out of the way.  Ok that's it.

      Last night was fun.  I had my private in Sangin which was really good.  It is fun to be back in that part of town from time to time.  I then went over to Fenton's where we played a couple hands of poker.  They started really early and I couldn't' make the first half but I did pretty well for myself in the hour that I did play.  In the end I was up around 10k I think.  I only won three hands but most of it came from a pretty big hand that involved Rob, Caleb and I.  I ended up taking it with a full house.  I think that hand alone was in the 7k range.  Fenton bet all this 10 won coins at some point and I was unlucky enough to win that hand.  But when I got home I put all that change that I didn't want into the birthday present that is a Tequila Slamma bottle piggie bank.  Next time we need to play longer and do it on a night where everyone can show up early enough.  Andrew brought my rice cooker back so I think I'll cook me some rice and something tonight to celebrate.   On the way home I had one the more interesting cab rides in my Korean career.  It was this lady (which is weird to begin with b/c I'm going home at almost 2 in the morning) who was between 40-50 and very talkative.  At some point she was talking about sex I think and me hooking up with prostitutes.  Then she stated making suggestive motions with her little finger as if to imitate a penis.  Then she show me pictures of her daughter, who looked pretty darn good.  So my conclusion, I think she wanted to whore her daughter out to me.  Or maybe not, stuff gets lost in translation you know. Ok something really odd just happened to me.  I was sitting here typing and this kid just walking up right next to me and preceded to stare at me.  I turned and looked at the kid who just continued to stare at me.  I said "anyoung" (hello) and then he ask me if I was Korean, because I look so Korean I guess.  I told me him know and then he asked if I was American and I said yes.  Then he went away.  At first I thought he might be one of my students but most definitely not.   Speaking of students, I think I'll go teach some now.

      Well I'm hanging out in Sangin now at the old PC room I used to come to all the time.  I'm killing time until my private.  I came here way early cause I have a ton of time to kill.  Well blogging well help a little.  Last night was fun.  It was Andy's send off.  Everyone met at Outback and had dinner.  From there we went to a place that I had never been before, Jennifer's Itawon or something like that.  It was nice enough.  From there we traveled to The Commune and then to Titanic.  I think I'm going to stop having big meals right before I eat b/c it really hampers my ability to drink well.  I did have a really good steak, but the coke was horrible.  First it was flat as ass and then it was barely acceptable.  Oh well it was fun none the less.  I gracefully bowed out as people were heading to the singing room.  If I would have started singing I would have lost my voice again.  I enjoy having it back and I plan to keep it that way.   I spent a lazy afternoon downtown.  First I went to my favorite restaurant and had some kimchi rice.  Then I hit up Seattle's Best where I read, studied and wrote in my journal.  There weren't many foreigners at all there for a Sunday.  I wanted to see a movie but nothing even remotely good was playing.  I'll definitely be hitting up The Matrix on Wednesday night.  After which we can hangout downtown.  I am really tired, I wish I could take a nap.  I'm going to get a hat to pull over my eyes so I'll never have to worry about that damn sun waking me up again.  Geez why did I come down here so early?   I found my way into a new bookstore that has a pretty big English section.  It is under the Samsung building near the Banwoldang Subway station.  I checked it out today and it is a nice change.

      This is the final blog of the year.  I really have nothing to say but I just wanted to type something.  To everyone, it has been a fun year.  I hope 04 brings the best for everyone.  I should talk about my favorite events of the year and the people who have influenced me the most but I don't have time.  I'm currently at Asma's.  Maybe I'll do it later.  Happy New Year!!!

      I don't have much to say but I'll  blog b/c nobody else seems to want to, except for Caleb.  I should be playing some video games with Fenton later tonight.  That should be fun.  I need to lay off of the alcohol related activities until tomorrow.  I'll revise and finalize the rules for the "make out pact."  First, whoever you make out with can't be in the friend group.  Further more it can't be someone you've already made out with.  Everyone else will be the judge of attractive.  But in general it is up to you (the participant) to use common sense.  Also we are functioning on the honor system so please be honest.    What is up with the weather?  Isn't it winter?  I guess I shouldn't be complaining but man last year it was frigid.  I think I could walk around in t-shirt today.  I think my short term compute goal will be to find a quiz nobody has taken yet.  Will Asma really have soju punch tomorrow?  I hope so.  That stuff is a little bit awesome.  As bad as soju tastes it mixes so well with so many things.   Georgia Tech is still unbeaten and now ranked #3.  That is basketball of course.  Football on the other hand stinks and will play in the Humanitarian Bowl.  What kind of crap is that?  There are way to many bowl games nowadays.  Off to teach the kids.

      Is my grammar really that bad in my entries?  It probably is.  I think I'll start to proof read them.  On second thought maybe not.  That's what happens I guess when you live abroad too long.  Ok today was a long damn day.  I'm so glad it's over.  I took my roommates last class so I could get off early on Wednesday.  I think I've about had enough of LIKE.  I think it order to be in charge or something at LIKE you have to have no clue what you're doing so you can make decisions based on absolutely nothing at all.  Needless to say I just don't understand some things going on at my school.  I think the mindlessness of the material at LIKE is getting to me.  Really I don't think these kids can learn much of anything no matter how hard we try to teach Open 2 lesson whatever.  The material is just garbage.  No wonder students are dropping left and right.  We have no holiday in Feb.  That sucks.  I need to stop taking the quizzes but with so much time on my hands I just can't help it.         I am the Charmer     Charm is seduction without sex. Charmers are consummate manipulators, masking their cleverness by creating a mood of pleasure and comfort. Their method is simple; they deflect attention from themselves and focus it on their target. They understand your spirit, feel your pain, adapt to your moods. In the presence of a Charmer you feel better about yourself. Learn to cast the Charmer's spell by aiming at people's primary weaknesses: vanity and self-esteem.      Symbol: The Mirror.  Your spirit holds a mirror up to others. When they see you they see themselves: their values, their tastes, even their flaws. Their lifelong love affair with their own image is comfortable and hypnotic; so feed it. No one ever sees what is behind the mirror.          urlLink What Type of Seducer are You?   created by  urlLink    urlLink polite_society

      Where to begin?  I'm here to blog again but I'm a little tired so I hope I remember most of what I want to say.  First the "a" on this keyboard doesn't work very well.  Too bad for me.  I wished I'd blogged yesterday about Friday.  Oh well.  Warning if you don't want to read about sam gyup sal again you might not like this entry, or at least part of it for that matter.  I'll warn you at the time though. I'll start with Friday night.  Guys night out was a success again.  By that I mean we all got plenty drunk and had fun doing it.  I brought along my playing cards to Bellagio and a good time was had.  There was a little bit of doubt as to whether Gabe could join but he managed to pull through if splendid fashion.  But previous to that we ate some gal bi, which a little pricey and not very filling.  Fountain was nice enough to hit me in the head with a bottle cap as he attempted to be a badass and open the bottle without a bottle opener.  He also told us he got the boot from GR for trying to crowd surf.  That kept me laughing pretty much the rest of the night.  Next was off to Fe which is where El Toro used to be.  We ordered stuff on the menu, the only problem was they didn't have any of it.  Screw it, we didn't stay there long.  Also the rest of the night was riddled with comments about the periodic table.  Despite Bellagio being dead it was pretty fun.  I brought my Beck's playing cards which facilitated for some serious drinking.  Gabe and Caleb had to go off and cheer some random table of Koreans.  Fountain and Caleb had to both drink double on titanic.  If you are wondering what kind of game that is check out Becky's sight where the rules are explained it full.  Gabe also broke out a game called pyramid.  The rules are still a little vague but it was fun none the less.  I think we went to GR after that.  Not much happening there so it was to New Blue.  I'm going to make a pretty bold prediction.  I think that before fountain leaves he is going to get in fight with somebody.  I base this on his rather reckless behavior when he gets extremely intoxicated.  Friday night this consisted of him through shrimp chips at everyone within range at New Blue.  I think I got home around 5 maybe a little after.  I have to say it was a lot of fun.  I enjoy hopping around from place to place.  BTW anyone who wants to go to Bellagio on Monday nights let me know, 3:1 cocktails.  Just can't beat that with a stick.   Ok I think that sums that up, onto Saturday.  Last night was a little bit crazy in a lot of ways, but I will say I had a really good time despite it all.  I think it might have been a little exciting.  I came downtown around 8:30 and met Alex for dinner.  Don't read this next part if you don't like sam gyup sal or journal entries pertaining to it.    So I was like "what do you want to eat?"  Can you guess what the answer was?  Yeah so we ended up eating that fried pork again.  Now here is the good part.  I found an awesome restaurant where it was super cheap.  The service there was crap but when you're paying so little I guess it doesn't really matter.  You have to say on the old lady, I don't think she has any short term memory.  Now I've stated before sam gyup sal is a crazy food with odd side effects.  Last time I wasn't hungry for days.  This time I think it kept me from getting hella wasted.  I think it somehow blocked the alcohol.  Is that possible?  I don't know.  Someone else eat a lot of it and then drink a lot and get back to me.  Really I should never eat it again but we all know that just won't be the case.    It should be ok to read from here on.  We then went to Bellagio and had a drink.  This was the beginning for the end for Alex.  Caleb joined us and then he went and got Meika and Gumi James from TC.  At some point there was a cocktail show going on in Bellagio.  What is hate is that all the bartenders stand around and watch so you can't get another drink until after it's over.  What a pain in the ass.  Asma, Becky and Sara showed up shortly after.  At this point Alex was pretty much toasted.  BTW she didn't eat nearly as much SGS as I did so she doesn't count.  She is pretty smart about getting strong drinks I'll give her that.  She orders a drink, tells them to make it strong, then complains about it and gets them to top it off with more.  With everyone assembled the games began.  Titanic seemed to be the game of the night.  The finger game kinda bombed, but hey it was fun on Friday night.  Becky lost the most I think.  I will say though she chugged that stuff down in  way that would make the UG of A very proud.  I lost once and was doing soju shots with Meika and Gumi James.  Caleb left to go somewhere and was never seen again, at least by me anyway.  He messaged me later around 4 but I didn't notice.  My apologies.  Oh yeah Brain showed up too.  Bellagio was packed.  It is a pretty good place to start on Saturdays.   Asma and Becky's friend Sara turned out to be really cool.  Not only that but she was a hoss.  She walked off the plane, into drinking, then into the cage at Gypsy Rock.  When I got off of my flight I passed out and went to bed.   At some point someone was talking about going to a singing room, Asma.  Luckily that got shot down.  I'm sure it will happen in the near future.  Next we ended up at Fe.  This place really isn't that cool, it's just too new.  Meika ordered  a cocktail but they didn't have any.  Here is where Becky started sticking it to me about being a Yellow Jacket.  Here apologies go out to Gumi James.  For some reason I thought he was calling me a wimp and I wanted to challenge him to arm wrestling.  This turned out to be a big miscommunication.  This is also where I began to realize the possible power of the aforementioned food.  Really I should have been much more drunk then I was.  Next was GR of course.  I didn't see the usual foreign crowd but there were others to make up for it.  Oh-ni was there so I talked to her for a bit.  Apparently Helen was there to and tried to talk to Asma for a bit.  Seems she wonders why people don't talk to her.  Oh yeah b/c she is crazy for starters.  I ended up in the cage with Sara for a bit.  Alex in here extremely drunken state split of GR and went to Julliard where she drank more.  I had to go retrieve her later.  We made a cameo at BB and then went for food at New Blue.  Now this is where stuff started to really get interesting.  Someone I invited to eat with us sat down and got an attitude with me for no apparent reason.  Acting on good advice I let it go.  I ended up at home in bed around 6.  Of course I woke up at 10 but I forced myself to go back to bed and ended up around 12.  Overall a really fun night.  I haven't felt that alive in a long time.  Fountain, Gabe, Eileen and Maebh were notable absences.  I'm sure there are others I just can't think of them right now.  I need a good night's sleep.  I think I've typed enough for now.  Today was uneventful.

      Yeah so I've eaten like hell the last two days.  My aunt was nice enough to send me a tin of cookies which I've almost finished by myself in the span of two days.  The John Bacon Burger yesterday wasn't a step in the right direction either but it was so good.  My Korean lesson was canceled today so I'm left with a little time to blog.  I'm very happy with these new contact lenses.  My last ones sucked, or at least the left one did b/c it irritated the hell out of my eye.  I think I'll have to buy more glasses before I leave.  Just too good a bargin to pass up.  Mr. Kim called me today and woke me up looking for someone to judge a speech contest today.  I politly declined but I do wonder which teacher will get the pleasure.  Crap I've been taken over my msn.  Note to self never open msn while trying to blog.  Might write more later.

      Ok time for a little Christmas blogging.  First I'd like to say thank you to Mieka and Andrea for the Christmas cards I received last night.  They were unexpected but not unappreciated.  You guys made my night as those were pretty much my only Christmas presents.  Not having work is really awesome.  I had not work on Tues so this is my third day off and I'm loving it.  Yesterday I went downtown to eat with some Korean teachers but one of them woke up super ass late and I had to wait for her for about an hour.  Damn Koreans.  We were supposed to meet at 1 and she woke up at like 12:45.  Give me a break.  After that I came back took a nap hit the gym and then went to meet Asma at Bellagio.  Here I received a deck of Beck's playing cards that Connan was nice enough to give me.  They were wrapped and everything.  We had a drink there and then headed to the Commune.  Bellagio was fucking packed.  TC wasn't really happening when I first got there but that soon changed.  I've never seen a place in Daegu so full before.  Caleb had a miniature beer mug he was drinking out of that  I must have filled up a dozen times.  Fenton stuck me with a pitcher that I ended up holding for like 20 minutes while he went to the bathroom.  That shit started to get heavy after a while.  Brian didn't wear his Baylor hat.  I don't know what else happened.  I didn't stay too long.  TC really just isn't for me.  Alex and I ended up hanging out and hitting Bellagio back up.  Then after that we ended up eating sam gyup sal.  Man if there is one thing worse then making a mistake, it is making the same mistake over and over again.  I'm going to take a minute to explain my sam gyup sal experiences of late.  So I ate it last night, the night before with oh-ni, who took me out to dinner, and I ate it last week for fountain's b-day.  I need to lay off of it or it will kill me, but damn it's good.  Ok back to Saturday.  That is really about it.  I wish I'd hit up GRAY or somewhere.  Someone was saying pinnacle's had all you could drink, but by that time I'd had enough to drink.   Today was tame but good.  My parents called and woke me up.  I cleaned my room and washed some clothes.  Always a good gift to give yourself, a clean room and some clean clothes.  I then got my act together and went downtown to buy some Christmas presents.  I was going to go clothes shopping but that never materialized.  Instead I did get some new glasses and contacts.  I love how cheap corrective eyewear is here.  I met Alex and had coffee and then we met Becky and Mieka and had some Bennigan's.  I got the burger.  Yeah it is totally typical foreigner but hey it is really great and just hit the spot.  We then hung out at Seattle's and Asma and Gumi James joined.  This was a nice uneventful Christmas.   I plan on getting some good sleep tonight.  Tomorrow should be guys night out again.  We'll see, I hope it materializes.  I'm good to go that's for sure.   The Christmas song I miss most is "Christmas in Dixie" by Alabama.  Yeah I'm from Georgia and I don't expect anyone to know about that song except maybe Becky and Asma.  There were tons of people downtown today.  I love being tall in Korea, you can just look out over the ocean of short Asians as you walk through downtown.  Go Georgia Tech basketball.  Undefeated and ranked number 4.  Looks like they'll at least make the tournament this year.  I know it's early but they are well overdue.  I've found the best way to improve your reading and writing in Korean is to give Korean girls you cell phone number.  They will text message your fingers off. Ok Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.

      So looks like I really did misspell Daegu.  But at least I went back and corrected it.  I might have tomorrow off.  I really hope I do.  That would work out great b/c then I'd have three days in a row off.  I don't know what I'll do but I'm sure I'll figure something out.  My abs hurt from where Meabh and Alex were hitting me on Saturday night.  I think I might be in for tuna sandwich making today.  Oh joy.  For some reason the owners of my academy think that making a tuna sandwich is the perfect way to celebrate Christmas.  It must be a Korean thing.   I want to take a trip out of the country.  I think I'll try and do that in January.  Last year we went to China for Chinese New Year.  You think that China would be the place to be for a holiday named "Chinese New Year".  Not really, it was dead, really dead.  But we'll see.  This is about the longest I've ever been in Korea continuously.  It really isn't so bad I guess.  I just wish I had a better variety of food to eat.   Seems there is a lot of drama going on lately on all fronts.  I guess this is the holiday season and that is too be expected.  I just hope everyone is happy.  Doesn't feel like Christmas in Korea does it?  Last year we had a white Christmas, maybe we'll be lucky again this year.  If I hear that fucking Wham "last Christmas" song again I might kill someone.

      Is Christmas really on Thursday?  Just sneaks up on you over here.  Stuff is good but I am tired.  Really tired.  I have crap to do like was my clothes and clean my room.  Fun, fun, fun.  Friday was a lot of fun.  I was Guys night out.  Started with Fenton, Caleb and I eating at possibly the best restaurant in Daegu.  It is possible I have an unhealthy obsession with this place.  I ate there again today, but man it's good and has the best kimchi in Korea.  We then hit up the Batman Hof.  I was hoping for a little more.  The beer was cold, too bad the rest of the place was cold too.  Gabe joined us here and we all migrated to Miller Time.  On the way there I almost tripped and fell on my face thanks to one of those plastic jugs placed on the sidewalk for no real reason what so ever.  But it was cool as it was an opening to meet a girl who studied English in London.  Here is a rundown of the conversation. girl- "what do you do?" me- "I'm an English teacher.  What do you do?" girl- "I'm a dancer." me- "ballet?" girl- "no" me- "ah sah!!" Turns out she works as a dancer at Woobang Tower land.  The were heading to Gypsy Rock.  I like Miller Time.  Here we played some silly drinking games and had dark beer.  Next we hopped across to Bellagio.  Here was more beer and movie quotes to boot.  Apparently someone lost at a game and had to come over and ask us for beer.  Of course we hooked him up and invited him to sit down.  We were then off to upstairs Gypsy Rock but not much happening there.  We dipped into Bubble Bar but I head home shortly after.  I think we need to make every Friday night guys night out.  Lots of fun.  It was a real breath of fresh air to be able to move around and do stuff with only four people too. Saturday the Fenton House had a B-day.  This marks one year to the day that we met.  I met him last year on his B-day in Jazz on Jazz.  This time we hit up WABA for some sam gyup sal.  I was a little timid given last weekends experience which I still might or might not be suffering from.  WABA is damn good but it's expensive and the meat takes forever to fucking cook.  This sucks when you want to eat.  We then hit The Commune.  Here we did the b-day song and cake thing.  I ate two pieces of cake.  I really miss good cake sweet cake.  The shit here is so bland.  Oh well.  I then split out with Fenton's teacher friend Alex and hung with her until I met up with everyone again at New Blue.  She is nuts, in a good way.  She is a far cry from the typical Korean girl.  I ended up at home around 5ish.  Maybe this is why I'm tired. Today was tame.  Asma just called to see if I wanted to catch dinner but I'm busy.  Bummer I'd like to go to Bennigan's.  I spent most of the afternoon having coffee with So-Yon.  We talked for like 3 hours.  Lately I've been in SB a lot.   Anyone doing shit for Christmas?  We should at least eat somewhere.  We should probably make reservations now.  Oh the memories of last Christmas come rushing back.   Ok I said I would talk about Ji-Eun b/c she was cool enough to leave a nonracist remark on my page.  She is a girl I met working last year in Hwawon and is probably my best Korean friend.  We always eat pizza for lunch.  But she bailed out of this last teachers meeting.  Pizza buddy this is for you.

      I haven't updated in awhile.  I don't really have much time as I have been reading everyone else's blogs.  There is always shit I wanna say but when I get here it just all seems to evaporate.  This week has been cool.  I met some girls in Seattle's Best on Tuesday and I'll see one of them again this weekend for coffee.  Fenton's B-day is this Saturday so that should be fun.  He wants to eat Sam gyup sal but I'm not sure I'm over my last experience from last Saturday.  I feel like a snake that ate a big mouse and now doesn't need to eat for weeks.  My diet has gotten a lot more healthy over the past few weeks though, so I'm proud of that.  I want to do something tonight but looks like I might be alone.  I don't think anyone is up for anything.  We'll see.  I'll go downtown and at least hang out a bit and maybe I'll run into someone or find something to do.  I had a teachers meeting yesterday which bordered on crazy.  I guess I can't really get into it b/c there is a slight chance that someone could link to my page from Asma's and word could get back to the big dogs.  It is probably best left unsaid anyway.  Saw "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" on Wednesday/Thursday morning.  I'm still not set in my opinion but I'll say I wasn't knocked off of my feet.  Some stuff was laughable.  Overall it was a good flick but not as good as the other two.  If someone wants to hangout tonight let me know.  I think it would be good to head out in a group of not 15 or 20 for once.  Just my opinion.  I need to get some warmer clothes.  Stuff is getting cold around here.  I'd like to say thank you to Ji-eun for posting to my sight.  I said I'd write about her which I will in my next entry.  I have to roll to class now.

      Little bit of time to kill before work again.  Why am I not hungry?  What has this sam gyup sal done to me?  I've had a banana today and that is it.  I think I'll just wait till I get hungry?  But then what if I don't get hungry and just die from starvation?  Man whatever I did I shouldn't do it again.  On Friday nights Bellagio has 20% off on cocktails.  Really it isn't 20% off but it's close.  6K cocktail is only 5K.  In reallity is should be 4,800 but who is counting?  Asma and I ended up hanging out on Friday and a bunch of new people at the Commune.  We then hit New Blue which is the awesomest place to drink in Daegu.  Oh-ni was out of town this weekend for her grandmother's b-day.  We haven't talked is a few days.  We'll see if things pick back up or not.  I think things could have played themselves out.  Not sure so we'll see.   I think I'm going to have to get a space heater.  Stephen keeps turning the heat off in the middle of the night, so when I get up to hit the  bathroom early in the morning it is freezing and I can't fall back to sleep.  What a pain.  Why is Korea so noisy?  Really, everywhere is so damn loud.  I wish could live somewhere without constant noise.  From the airplanes to the trains to the vegie/fruit vendors with their loudspeakers it just really begins to get old.  Not to mention random people walking down the street at night yelling.  What I wouldn't give for some  warmth, peace and quiet.  Is it really so much to ask for?  On to work.

      I don't even know where to begin.  First, that is awesome they caught Saddam.  I was watching a movie when Gabe text messaged me the good news.  Last night was a lot of fun.  I'm really tired though and I'll go home and hit the sack after I'm done with this.  There was a gathering at Meabh's but I was absent b/c I'd made plans to meet Ju-mi again.  We ate and drank some soju.  This is after I had already eaten with Caleb at possibly the best restaurant in Daegu.  But it was cool b/c I was hungry and we at sam gyup sal which is something I love more then words can describe.  Well we ate up and the moved to a Jazz club.  She went home after that and I hooked up with the homies at The Commune.  I was really full, but more on that later.  We then moved to Gypsy Rock where I met a captain in the Korean army and danced the night away with a science teacher in the cage.  We then rolled to upstairs but it was pretty bland actually.  It seemed everyone had a good deal to drink.   I didn't sleep very well last night due to all the damn pork I ate.  Not only that but I didn't eat anything all day and was never hungry.  That's odd.  Has my body lost the ability to digest pork?  I finally ate something about 10 or so just because.  Either way I think I'll go easier on it next time.  Today was simple.  I hung out with Becky in Seattle's and then watched Hollywood Homicide.  Not a good movie but good enough for Korea.  I also picked up two more Korean books as I have finished my others.  I've slacked off on my book but I intend to put a little more effort into it.   I wish I had more free time.  But hell I only work about 4-4.5 hours a day.  What the hell am I saying?  How will I adjust to real life?  I always feel like I have more to say but I can never remember what it is when I come to write.  I hate that.

      As I have a little free time I'll just babble for awhile.  As it turns out there is a KTF store in my neighborhood.  That was a very pleasant surprise.  So I hit it up today and got my phone working again.  I don't know what I'm going to do tonight.  At some point poker night was suggested but I'm not sure if that will materialize.  Today is the start of level tests and Steve has no work.  What a bitch.  Oh well I'm hoping I get tomorrow off.  It is getting colder but really it hasn't gotten that cold.  Finally my heater works.  This is good b/c I hate having to fall asleep while freezing my ass off.  I wonder if I'll work with Judy today?  One if my friends Clint is getting married.  This is strange b/c I never thought he'd get married.  His brother Meat (note, not his real name) is currently serving in Iraq.  I think we've hit a period of low energy amongst the friend group.  Seems I am the only one who always wants to go out and get crazy.  This could prove a problem for me.  I think I'm all Communed out.  The place is nice but I do believe in the old adage "there is too much of a good thing".  I also think I'm the only person not burnt out on downtown.  I guess I have a high tolerance.  Speaking of downtown it is getting all messed up.  One of my favorite places "Beer Boom" has be completely destroyed.  What a bummer.  On top of that the place across from WABA was knocked down and it now being rebuilt.  Stuff opens and closes in Korea so quickly.  The turnover on shops is just crazy.  Has El Toro been rebuilt yet?  I want to go shopping but I don't know what I want.  Does that make any sense?  I also dislike shopping in Korea b/c the owners of the shops are all so pushy and stuff.  Not to mention stuff in department stores is insanely expensive.  I need to clip my finger nails.  Ok time for work.

      I'm tired.  I feel like I have stuff to say I just hope I can remember it all.  Last night was what I would call and improvised night out.  It wasn't supposed to be anything special and then at some point got completely out of control.  Yesterday was pay day so I suggested to my roomy Steve about hitting up the Hotel GS Plaza bar which is really the only place to go around here.  He was down with it so after work I hit the gym got some food and swung by the house.  I think we got there around 11 or so.  We met the girl he is seeing  there and hung out for awhile.  Then we were joined by my friend Ju-Mi who I haven't seen in forever  but showed up ready to drink.  We did a little damage there and then migrated downtown a little after 1.  It was first to Bellagio where we took it plenty of Korean drinking games which involved soju and beer.  Then it was on to Julliard where we continued with flaming drinks.  I ended up buying the round of flaming shots for some reason.  But hell it was pay day so who cares.  I finally ended up walking home in the snow around 5 in the morning.  I actually slept pretty well too.  I think that was my excitement for the week.   On a less rowdy note I met Oh-Ni yesterday for lunch and we had pizza and walked around and shopped a little.  Things seem to be going well enough with her.  My cell phone is out of time and I need to recharge it at a KTF telecom.  Too bad for me all he the stores are only downtown.  You know there are seriously like a 100 KTF places downtown to recharge your phone at.  You think they'd have the common sense to have store somewhere else.  I guess not.   I love reading other people's blogs.  I haven't been on point about reading them this week and I just caught up tonight.  I really enjoyed Becky's blog about my students.  In and interesting turn of events today I taught that class and they called me out on the fact I gave Becky the downlow.  But  things were cool.  Then they started to tell me how sexy Becky was.  Next one of them said I was Becky and started rubbing my chest and then began to hump me furiously.  It is classes like this that keep me entertained.   Steve gets tomorrow off.  That sucks for my ass.  I hope I get Saturday off or something.  Else I might have to raise a little hell.  I finally opened a KB bank account today.  That was exciting.  I think I'll take those ink blot tests and post the results.  Ok I just looked for it and couldn't find it.  I don't think I have anything else to say.  I'm going to bed.

      I hate it when blogspot is down and I want to blog.  That happened last night but I made use of my time and wrote a few testimonials on friendster and then just screwed around on the web.  This weekend was pretty darn good.  Times are really picking up and time is starting to fly.  Friday was a cozy gathering at Gabe's.  I haven't been there since I was there last, I guess that goes without saying.  I think it was about a year ago I was last there.  I remember it b/c Caleb's mom was visiting.  There were quite a few people that showed up but nobody stayed for really long and it wasn't a very long night.  I had a good time.  Asma made some cranking soju punch which I almost single-handedly took care of.  I don't know why anyone didn't have any but whatever, their loss.  It really tasted just like Kool-aid, except that it would get you drunk.  We saw the Paris Hilton sex tape, not that great.  In interesting news on the way home Asma and I almost got killed in a cab.  You might think I'm joking but we narrowly avoided a head on collision with another car.  Had we been sober I think he reality would have sunk in.  To the best of my recollection a car crossed the center line and our cabby swerved out of the way and kept apologizing for the next 10 minutes.  Ok it is scary just typing about it now.   Saturday was fun as well.  I had a date with Oh-Ni that went well.  Unfortunately she monopolized almost my time but it was still a good night out.  She picked me up and we headed downtown.  The fact that she has car is just awesome.  We got some Japanese food and then hit up Seattle's while we waited for Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World to start.  Ok that title is just a little too long.  It is up there with Romey and Michelle's Highschool Reunion.  Anyway the movie was pretty good.  I guess I wasn't really expecting much when I went in so I was pleased.  It would have helped if I didn't have to piss like a race horse half way through the movie.  This in and of itself isn't really a big deal but then when you factor in that we were in the middle of this huge row which was packed it begins to become a real pain in the ass.  Through shear willpower I toughed it out until the end.  A good hour later I might add.  But I survived.  We then dipped into The Commune and said hello to the birthday boy Gabe.  At the time of my arrival Caleb and Gabe were plugging away at the task of opening the tequila.  As I left they had just gotten in open.  I thought I would meet up with them again but that was not to be the case.  We then hit up Bellagio and had a cocktail.  I really like Bellagio when you aren't going with like 15 people.  It is a good place to chill.  After Bellagio I called it a night and she gave me a lift home.  I love girls with cars. Sunday wasn't too special.  One of the teachers at my school quit about 2 weeks ago and invited me and some of the other teachers out to see her so I went to a place called Ha-Yang.  It is about 30 minutes outside of the city from where I am.  We ate lunch and had some coffee.  I then hung out with Oh-Ni and her friend downtown before coming home to crash.   We need to organize and go out during the week sometime.  I know you Ding Ding Dang people can't b/c you have work ass early in the mornings.  By that I mean at like 10am but whatever.  So yeah whoever doesn't have work early and reads this page or knows of people who don't work early we should all head out on like Tuesday or Wednesday night.  I think it would be a great way to break up the week.  I miss going out on week nights.   I was reading this crazy story in an English conversation book and it was about these two Chinese people.  A guy and a girl.  So the guy feel in love with this girl at first sight.  The dated for a year and he asked her to marry him.  She said no that she wasn't ready.  So what he decided to do to show her his love is that he wrote her a letter everyday for two years.  It was then delivered everyday by the same mailman.  So for two years this chick got these love letters and then she decided she wanted to get married.  About damn time right?  Well here is the twist, she ditches the dude and marries the mailman.  How messed up is that?  I would have kicked that chick's ass if I was the guy who wrote her for two years.  But that is just me.   I think LIKE is about to drive me crazy.  I think I've had all I can take of stupid lesson like "what day is it today?", and "what month do you like?".  Work is easy but the material is crap and I think I'm about at the end of my rope.   In other completely unrelated news I've started cooking and eating breakfast.  I think I never ever cooked before b/c my previous roommate wasn't the cleanest of people.  There has been a recent discovery that only reinforces that fact.  But it is far to gross to write about.  But on a health note anyone who doesn't eat breakfast really should start.  I find it really does give me more energy.   I need new glasses and contacts.  I got the cheap shit and it's beginning to catch up with me.  Yeah, that's all for now. Actually I lied.  Seeing as how I'm loaded with freetime I took the sexy quiz from Asma's page and here are the results.    Patrick, you're Hot 'n' Sexy   When you enter a room, all eyes gravitate toward you. Like a moth to a flame, people can't help but notice you. Maybe it's how you casually move through a crowd or that glow you give off when you flash that smile. You're hot and it shows. Could it be the haircut that says it all about you, the jeans that fit just right, or the casual way you saunter across a room looking confident from all angles? You have an air about you that commands respect from men and women alike. You possess such outward strength that these people ache to be around you. When you speak, people hang on your every word. You are so full of charisma and cachet that, whether in a business or social setting, you can gauge the mood in the room and offer the right compliment or provocative statement for any scene. Do you have a secret intuition about how people work? Just maybe. And that's one of the sexiest things about you.   Ok so this is somewhat laughable.  I have no clue what I answered to get these results but whatever I'll take it.

      Not much new to say.  I've been whipping myself into shape since I've been back.  Despite the fact my gym pretty much sucks I've been getting a lot of quality time in there and I'm beginning to notice a difference.  Gabe's birthday is tomorrow.  I'll be going out there I think.  I haven't been in that part of town for a long time.  Should be a nice change of scenery.  I was gonna take these new online quizzes but I'm too pooped.  I might do that later.  I really don't have squat to say.  Stuff is pretty normal.  Time is beginning to pick up and move really quick again.  I'm looking forward to the weekend, should be fun.

      It is cold outside, but man is it warm up in this PC room.  Ok I've got a little more energy now so I'll pick up where I left off.  Anyway Fenton and I hopped a cab downtown to meet Oh-Ni (the girl I met last week in GR) and her friend.  Well they got caught in traffic and we had a little wait in front of Burger King.  But luckily for us there was also a Korean who spoke great English who was more than willing to converse with us.  They finally made it and we met up and all.  I have to admit, at first it looked like this could be a disaster.  They were hungry so we grabbed some food.  I think this was the definition of awkward.  They weren't speaking much English and I was doing my best to speak Korean.  Good thing that came and went quickly.  At this point I expected Fenton to ditch me at any point but he hung like a trooper.  We went to Bubble Bar first.  Little did I know at the time it would be the last place we went as well.  Things were cool.  We got some drinks and danced.  The ice was definitely thinning and then it finally broke and everyone was in fully swing having a good time.  Time melted away in there.  I danced with Oh-Ni and Fenton with the friend, whose name I can't remember and I'm too embarrassed to ask again.  At this point I hadn't seen anyone else who was in the friend group.  Becky wondered in from The Commune and said she'd be back b/c she needed to grab some food.  But that was the last we saw of her.  At some point though everyone came to BB.  Literally I felt like I knew everyone there.  Caleb must have really been as drunk as he describes b/c it seems he doesn't remember meeting either me or my date at BB.  Asma "kissed" me there, funny though, I mistook it for a slap in the face.  Oh-Ni got one too and I had to apologize on Asma's behalf.  But she seemed really cool.  Fenton split out rather rapidly after others started arriving.  The friend asked about him but I said he had to go.  I was pretty sober from all the dancing.  There was a lot of dancing.  Then at some point we went in the corner and made out.  I owe the Gumminator (aka Gumi James) a drink.  Some black guy was dancing with the friend and she just couldn't shake him, so Oh-Ni told me to grab one of my friends and she then yanked the friend away.  Being the man of action Gumi James is he came to my aid.  Unfortunately I think the friend was embarrassed and it seemed a little bit awkward between the two but he gets props for helping out.  I'll tell you what is super cool is that Oh-Ni has a car and she gave me a lift home.  That is a little bit badass.  Even cooler is the fact that she is an art major, or something like that and has her own postcards with he work on it.  I just sent several off today in fact.  She dropped me off about 7 or so.  It was a good night. Onto Sunday.  Sunday started early for me, about 11 am, maybe a little after.  I got up and got moving to get ready for a wedding.  Two coaches at the gym I used to go to in Sangin were getting married at the Hotel GS Plaza, which is just around the corner from me.  I got dressed up and headed out there.  I'll tell you what a Korean wedding is a sight to see.  I don't even know where to start.  We will just say it was very "Korean".  There were bubbles, party popper things, sabers and people with all kinds of crazy clothes on, including the groom.  I don't know what Park coach was wearing, it looked like a tux but it was so over the top and shiny I wasn't sure.  I dressed pretty much like a square guessing things would be kinda the same.  I had a white shirt, black pants and tie.  Everyone else was decked out like movie stars and such.  It was pretty crazy.  One guy was in jeans and sweat shirt.  Korean weddings are so casual they are crazy.  Half of the room had seats, the front half, and the rest was standing room only.  But those seated are family and close friends.  Everyone else hangs out in the back and chats it up.  The bride kinda strolls down the isle meets the groom and the preacher talks forever but nobody else pays attention but them.  Everyone else is too busy socializing in the back.  I was also struck by how many people turned out for the wedding.  There seriously must have been around 200 people.  I'm sorry I didn't take you Asma, I know you wanted to go but I was afraid to wake you up and all that early on a Sunday.  So they kiss walk down the isle then there is a bunch of group picture taking.  I was actually in one of the pictures.  I don't know exactly how the pictures were organized but I was told to get in one and that I did.  Then the bride and groom head off to do some traditional Korean stuff and everyone else hits the buffet lunch downstairs complete with all you can drink so-ju and beer.  If only I hadn't been out so late last night.  It was a good time.  I sat with some of the other coaches from the gym and we had a little to drink.   Afterwards I headed downtown to chillout.  I found myself in Seattle's Best as usual.  Becky showed up and kept me company until I had to roll to Sangin.  Once finished there I met up with Oh-Ni and her friend and the black guy, whose name I also don't know, she was dancing with the night before.  I was surprised to see him again.  This dude I think was over 30, only a guess.  Well we decided to hit a movie and that movie was The Matrix 3.  Here is where it gets crazy.  The movie was still out of frame.  I don't think anyone ever did anything to fix it.  Here is where it gets crazier, I really didn't care.  Now here is the craziest part, I really liked it the second time around.  It is still subpar to say the least but I enjoyed it much more.  Maybe it was because I knew I wouldn't be disappointed or anything.  I also picked up on a lot of stuff I didn't the first time around.  All in all it was a good choice.  At this point things seemed to be going well between us. Onto Monday, I don't think anything really happened interesting on Monday.  Just work as usual and stuff.   Tuesday I met Oh-Ni for lunch.  I was a little worried b/c I thought the language barrier was going to be a problem but actually it wasn't a big deal.  We ate at Outback and then hit up Seattle's best.  Things went well.  She speaks and understand much more English than I was lead to believe at first.  We'll see where it goes though.  I think I'll see her again on Saturday.   I think that pretty much brings me up to date.  I want to just ramble on about random things but nothing is coming to mind.  Well one thing, I can't believe Gabe has a site now.  That is wild.  I'll add a link later when I get motivated.  Becky has also made her's public again which is a pleasant surprise.  Ok enough for now.

      Man I have so much to say but I'm so damn tired.  I've read everyone else's blogs and that was great fun.  I'll read them again when I'm not about to fall alseep.  I'll just spit it out and hope it all comes out right.  I'd have to say this has been the best weekend for me since I got here.  Friday night was good.  I took care of some business and then went drinking for a bit downtown.  We tried to bar hop but that kinda failed after the third bar.  I'm too tired to remember if anything really cool happened on Friday.  I don't think it did.  We all met at Seattle's and moved around to, The Commune of course then it was off to somewhere called Captian Morgan's or something.  That place was cool.  Very small and cozy.  Not really my style but it was cool.  I'm trying to think who was out.  It was Becky, Asma, Eileen, Meabh, Simon, and Peter.  At some point we picked up a guy who is locally known as Jesus, b/c he resembles the son of God.  Then we went to Jazz on Jazz.  After that it was back to The Commune.  I'm just all Communed out.  I can't take much more of it anymore.  I hadn't gotten enough sleep and was surprised I made it this far.  I got home around 3ish I think.   Saturday was the bomb.  First after work I went to the PC room with some of my students and we played Star Craft.  I lost.  We were playing a shitty map and I had the worst player on my team.  I was the last one standing however.  Then I hooked with Fenton and at some pork.  That was followed by a video game extravaganza.  We beat both Bad Dudes and Cadallacs and Dinosaurs.  Both great games.  We then headed downtown.  On the way out as fate would have it we bumped into Meabh and Eilleen.  Maybe a little bit awkward. I'm too tired, I'll fill in the rest later.  I'm not even gonna spell check.

      I want to insightful but I'm just not in that kind of mood.  I think I've come to the conclusion that the owners of LIKE are bound and determined to destroy their company at all costs.  These people just blow my mind with how little they do to help their own cause.  I just can't figure out why I care so much.  I think I've finally caught back up on sleep from the China trip.  Oh in good news my water now works.  I didn't explain before but when I got back on Sunday I came back to an apartment with no running water.  This was just awesome.  Time is flying and I can't believe people are going to be leaving soon.  This will certainly put a different spin on the social life here.  I'm ready for spring, forget this winter crap I'm done with it.  Being in Shanghai really makes me want to move to somewhere else.  I think I'll look for a real job in somewhere like Hong Kong or Singapore.   I have a student whose nickname is now ddong-juice.  For those of you that don't work in Korea ddong is Korean for poop.  He was trying to be a smart ass and I guess I got him back good b/c now all the kids call him that.  I feel a little bad.   I'm sure there is more I want to say but it just isn't coming to me.

      Well I guess I'll give the skinny on our trip back Sunday just to polish things off.  We woke up pretty much still drunk, me not so much.  We made it to the bus and that was about all.  The bus driver was still smiling but Ju-ohn was missing.  This is a little sad b/c we wanted to take a picture with him an see if showed up on film or not.  The tour guide was still talking too.  The Shanghai airport is just a little bit awesome.  But I still like Inchon better.  We had our parting group picture and swapped e-mails and phone numbers.  As I walked through security our tour guide finally feel silent.  This women talks like nobody else.  When we got back I thought there was going to be a bus from the airport to Daegu but looks like I was misinformed.  So this meant taking the train back.  Turns out this was a darn good idea.  It took only and hour and cost only 5,000won.  It was here we met t he last credited cast member of our trip, a nineteen year old Korean girl named A-Ram.  This chick blew my mind.  Of course she spoke great English, but so does everyone these days, but she had dropped out of highschool at 17 and moved to Seoul at 18 and it living in Seoul alone working and studying design.  It got even crazier when we started talking travel b/c this girl had been everywhere.  I consider myself well traveled by most standards but I didn't have much on this girl.  Anyway she was just really really cool and we ended up getting her number to call her next time we're in Seoul.  And just like that, we were back in Daegu.   Think there is more I want to blog about that doesn't concern my China trip but I'm pretty much blogged out.  A special thanks goes out to my travel buddy Fenton.  You made for some really fun company on the trip.  I think the Koreans thought we were nuts b/c we were always happy and laughing.  There were several key phrases that kept us laughing through the whole trip. 1) giver - this was said more times then I can even begin to count 2) honorable suicide  3) ripper 4) rocker 5) Mr. t and E.T. Ok really I think I'm done for now.  I miss everyone and I hope to see all you guys this weekend.

      So much to say and I don't even know where to start.  There is noway I'll remember everything I want to say, but here is my best effort.  I'll first say you might want to save this entry to read for a time when you're really board b/c I have a feeling it's going to be a bit long.  Ok well it has been a week since I've updated and so much has happened in this week.  I guess I'll go back to Tuesday night.  This was a little crazy and hectic.  At first I met and eat dinner with Gina and then we headed to Miller time to get some beer.  A few pitchers later we were at Bellagio where boys night 3 was being carried out in beautiful fashion.  I have to say I was a little sad I couldn't partake immediatly.  Anyway she proved to be good company and then we hooked up with the crew at Exodus.  We went to Exodus to check out Fenton's new Korean girl.  She turns out to be quite the looker from what I can remember.  Exodus has a special place in my heart.  This is the a place I went on my first night out in Korea.  Literally like the 2nd or 3rd bar I went to.  This was  also the night I met Asma, Ann and Mercedes.  But as time has told, only one of them turned out to be cool and the other two were just douche bags.  At this point I think everyone but Gumi James was feeling pretty good.  When he is drunk he loses some serious steam and kind of putters out.  But I'm not ragging on him.  After Exodus we headed to The Pulse.  This place seems to have something going on b/c I've been there a whole lot lately.  Again more of the same craziness.  Gina and I split out to get some food at New Blue but by the time the food arrived she wasn't hungry and I have to say I wasn't really that hungry either.  It was really late too and we'd both had too much too drink, her more so than me.  So we didn't even touch the food and asked the waiters to send it to another table.  She was able to find a cab home easily.  Me on the other hand, well after waiting for like 20 min I went back to The Pulse to hang out some more.  We chilled a little bit.  One important aspect to note, Tim knows what the shocker is.  This made my night.  You hear that Serd, someone over here knows about the shocker.  Next we all went to try and get a cab home.  Again, nothing doing.  So it was to BB.  At this point I'm tired drunk and really just want to go home.  I chill there for a bit and then take a third stab and getting a cab.  I don't know what the deal was.  Oh I forgot to mention that it was snowing after we left Exodus so I guess there might have been ice on the road.  I decided I wouldn't be deied this time.  I just kept walking until I came to a busy intersection.  Finally a cab had to stop at a red light and I jumped in.  He said he couldn't take me to where I wanted to go for some reason, I don't know, I couldn't understand.  I sure as hell wasn't about to get out so I told him I'd give him 10k to take me there and sure enough I ended up where I needed to go.  I was so worn out it wasn't even funny.  Of note I did get my Chinese Visa and everything got set up for the trip to China.   Wed Jan 21  The problem of getting in around 6 is that even if you sleep to 12 you only got 6 hours of sleep.  Well I did alright for myself and finally got up and moving and did some laundry.  I met Hey-Sook downtown and spent the afternoon and evening with her.  It was such a relaxing day and so much fun to not have work.  I took her to my favorite pork cuttlet resteraunt and then we went shopping for a bit and got some coffee.  Next we checked out a horribly boring Korean movie that I picked out in a dvd room.  I thought it would be really good b/c I'd seen the commercials, but looks can be decieving I guess.  We then tried to go eat some raw fish but the place she wanted to go to was closed.  This of course let us to he restaurant of restaurants, WABA.  I had a really nice dinner.  She makes for really good company.  Turns out I ran into Asma, Caleb, and Jeff there.  They were on a mission to have some fun and I think they succeded.  I had to call it a night go home, pack and get some sleep.     Thurs Jan 22  Shanghai trip cast of characters Patrick O'Dowd - myself Fenton House - himself Mrs. Ahn - tour guide who couldn't speak English Brian - Korean who spoke English but wouldn't tell us his Korean name, also married into the perfect Korean family Brian's Wife - oldest in the perfect Korean family and married to Brian Son-Min - second oldest in the perfect Korean family Ju-Hyun - youngest daughter in the perfect Korean family and thought I looked like Beckham Mr. Lee - head of the perfect Korean family Mrs. Lee - Mr. Lee's wife Son-Tek - only son and youngest of the perfect Korean family Excessivly happy Chinese bus driver - drove the bus, never stopped smiling, and we think he was the father of Ju-ohn, might have smoked weed too, but we aren't sure Ju-ohn - really creepy little Chinese kid who is probably the son of the bus driver, we think he was a ghost of spirit or something like that Chinese/Korean tour guide - talked continusly for 4 days straight quiet girl #1 - only talked to quiet girl #2 quiet girl #2 - only talked to quiet girl #1 Mrs. Ahn's friend - drank beer for breakfast poor kids - tried to beg money off of us Fenton's massuse - attempted to massage Fenton's feet but really just hurt them My massuse - gave me a rocking foot massage nice employee at our first hotel - directed us to breakfast when were hopelessly lost Harry - Fenton's student at Kids Club Bob - crazy drunk American who fought for a freedom face down in the muck in "Nam" Kitty - my Chinese interest Kitty's friend - friend to Kitty Woodstock waitress - crazy ass hooker man in a hurry - kept cutting in line at Shanghai tower and kept pushing Fenton Gollum look alike - looked exactly like Gollum from Lord of the Rings Shanghai tower employee - sent us to a night district we couldn't even begin to afford nice German guy - sent us a to night district we could afford Jacob - cool guy from Denmark French guy whose name I can't remember - got made fun of by Bob and then made fun of Fenton's French A-Ram - most unique Korean I've ever, and I do mean ever, met, kept us company on the train ride home.     These are the people who made our trip so memorable and so much fun.  Fenton let me know if I left anyone out.      The insanity begins.  Up and moving at 6:00 am.  I get my stuff and walk out the door.  I'm supposed to meet Fenton at 6:30 at Dong Daegu as our train will leave at 7.  I'm of course there 5 minutes early.  So I'm waiting.  6:30 comes, no Fenton.  No big deal he is usually fashionably late.  6:35, no Fenton.  Still got plent of time, all it good.  6:40, no Fenton.  Begining to wonder what's up?  Still got time but it's rapidly ticking away.  6:45, no Fenton.  Ok now I'm actively looking for a pay phone.  Come to find out there aren't any fucking pay phones inside the train station.  To top things off I have no minutes on my cell and no change to boot.  So I make change at the PC room part of the station and head to a phone.  The change machine gave me two 500s.  And wouldn't you know it a phone doesn't except 500s.  Ok at this point I'm getting more then a little annoyed.  So I buy a pack of gum to get a couple of 100s and call.  No answer.  I wait and call again, no wanswer.  Ok it's not 6:50 and no Fenton.  The reality of having to try and get there with out Fenton is now setting in.  My train of thought is this: if he had hit a big problem he would have called me, since he hadn't called and wasn't picking up I was worried he'd slept through his alarm and through the phone, since he had the tickets I'd have to buy another but I didn't know which station we were going to, also I didn't know how to get from the train station to the airport, finally I didn't know who or where we were supposed to meet, only he did.  So basically I was going nuts.  Approximatly 6:53 Fenton made it to the train station.  I was able to breathe a huge sigh of relief.  Turns out he got in his taxi and forgot his passport so he had to go back.  But it's all good now.  We made the train and managed to make our way to the airport.  We hooked up with the right people and got it all squared away.  Turns out our guide spoke next to no English, but who cares.  At this point it is just felt great to have all our ducks in a row.  We managed to make it through security, immigration and onto the plane.  I ended up sitting next to one of the guide's friends on the plane.  I will explain why this is off note.  Our plane left around 10:40.  Well about 30-40 minutes into the flight they started serving drinks.  I saw flight attendent walk up the isle with a trey of beers and I was wondering "who the hell would want to break out a brew at this crazy hour in the morning."  As it turns out the answer was sitting right beside me.  She has a beer with her brunch which consisted of some snack sandwiches and fruit.  Fenton sat next to Son-Tek, who actually used to go to Daemyoung LIKE, but he was before my time.   Ok so we actually touched down and make it through immigration, so it should be smooth sailing from here.  We hook it up with the bus and start to roll into Shanghai.  When we first got on the bus Fenton noticed that there was lingering oder of weed on the bus.  I couldn't tell but he was sure of it.  Shortly after we noticed our bus driver seemed to be really happy.  Little did we know he is always happy.  Like the bad kids in highschool Fenton and I take the back of the bus.  At this point our Korean/Chinese tour guide started speaking.  To sum up Shanghai in one word, I think I'd have to go with massive.  This place is huge on a level I can't even begin to explain.  There are so many tall buildings it's mind blowing.  The change in archatecture from Korea was welcomed.  Apartment buildings actually looked different and modern.  Shanghai is totally different from Beijing.  First of all it was time to eat.  On these tours Koreans only like to eat Korean food but much to my surpise we had Chinese food and it was darn good.  There was even a bottle of beer too.  After dinner we had a little dancing show and some chick tied a piece of string around my wrist and said it was for good luck.  This has happened before on another trip but I'm not sure which one.  Then we went to a park that had something to do with either Koreans or Korea or something, not really sure.  What I remember the most is the translation of rules for the park.  In English one of them came out to be "no urinate or shit in the park."  Next we went to some kind of sight that was important to the Korean independence moving involving Japanese occupation.  We really couldn't understand it all.  They did have the Korean declaration of Independence.  It was a Korean tour so go figure.  We then moved and took a river cruise.  This was acutally super cool.  Speaking of cool, the weather was pretty darn cold.  The river cruise was a great way to get a feel for the city.  On one side the have the most modern of modern skyscrappers and on the other is the old industrial loading docks and buildings with Europeon archatecture.  An amazing bled of old and new.  We then had to roll out to the next city on our tour.  This was Hapzhou.  Don't worry I didn't know anything about it either and I still don't know that much.  Here we grabbed dinner and hit the hotel.  On the way here there were fireworks going off all over the place.  At dinner we met Brian and turns out he has spent time in the states and speaks English really well.  There is always a someone of the tour who speaks freaking awesome English.  This is like an unwritten law.  He was along for the ride with his wife and inlaws.  Dinner was Korean food, again there was beer.  We toured around on the bus for a little, and remember the guide hasn't stopped talking yet.  The hotel turns out to killer.  This place is just massive.  Fenton and I get checked in and then we decided to take our chances on the streets and we go for a walk.  Highlights of the walk include being accosted by a pack of little kids to wanted money and buying a pack of cigs for 300 won.  These kids were hella annoying.  At one point they were hanging off of Fenton like a jungle gym.  Stuff seemed to be really dead.  We check out a few stores but nothing much was doing.  We settled for the lobby bar and then got some sleep.  Chinese beds are really hard.    Ok I kind of messed up.  I didn't think I published my last post but apparently I did.  You guys will have to excuse the horrible spelling errors, as I didn't run spell check and was super tired. With out any more delay I'll attempt to finish.   Fri Jan 23  Up and moving early.  I didn't sleep as well I would have liked b/c for some reason I was paranoid  that we wouldn't recieve our wake up call.  But sure as shit we got it at 7:30.  We made it out to breakfast and this is where the fun began.  While drinking in the lobby last night I noticed there was a restaurant on the second floor, or so it seemed.  So I figured lets go there b/c nobody told us where breakfast was at.  Well somehow we got lost in the "employee" section of the hotel looking for this place.  This is where we ran into the "nice employee at our first hotel" who, after the initial shock of seeing two tall ass white dudes in a part of the hotel that they shouldn not have been in, kindly showed us the way to breakfast on the 16th floor.  My bad.  Stuff only gets crazier here.  So we're going in to eat and we hear someone say "teacher."  Fenton looks around and sees one of his students from Kids Club.  Ok this is a little crazy.  How did this kid in Hapzhou China, much less in the same hotel?  He must have been on some kind of similar tour or something.  Fenton thinks the kid's name was Harry, so that's what is credited as.  Breakfast here was really good.  One thing I like about these tours is getting up and moving early and eating well in the morning.  We had dumplings, noodles, rice soup and assorted other goodies.  Then it was time to bus it.  Our first stop was a lake where we took another boat tour.  On the way there and during the trip it became very obvious that this city is huge.  I think I'll look up more about it later because I'm really curious.  The little boat cruise was fun.  We ended up sitting up top with a Chinese tour group, but it was cool.  The weather was a little cold but it was tolerable.  At this point I do wish I could have understood our guide.  On all the other tours I've been on there really hasn't been a need to understand the guide b/c you always knew pretty much about the places you were going.  But now that we were off the beaten path so to speak I wish I could understood exactly why stuff was so important.  This lake was surrounded by parks temples and towers.  After getting off the boat we spotted the only group of white tourists on the entire trip.  It was big old group of old westerners.  This really isn't important other then the fact that we barely saw any other round eyes on the trip.  Well back to the bus where the driver was still happy as ever.  We then headed to shop.  I think this is right.  Fenton correct my continuity if it is wrong.  We went to some pearl place where Fenton ganked a pearl from a dead clam in bucket.  Incidently this is how package tours are able to be so cheap.  The tour company brings the tourists to these overpriced shopping centers and then they get kick-backs whenever anyone buys anything.  Well we didn't buy squat.  At this point we started to clue into the fact that the little Chinese kid on our tour was a little wierd.  Fenton coined the name "Ju-ohn" for him.  This is after the Japanese ghost movie where the ghost of a kid goes around and terrorizes people.  The kid just runs around starts talking in Chinese and then runs away.  We believe him to be the sun of the weed smoking bus driver.  Next I think we hit lunch.  Again we had beer.  But it was different kind from the others.  This shit had the worst head of any beer I've ever poured.  Literally the head would not go away, unbelieveable.  It wasn't very good either.  Lunch was kind of tough on me.  There really wasn't much I liked, only the spicy tofu saved the day for me.  Oh we always eat rice with every meal so that's what I ate with the tofu.  Here we met the rest of Brian's family which was nice.  He didn't tell us their names, just there position as they related to him.  He must have had an experiance where white people just couldn't remember Korean names.  At this point I think they kind of adopted us.   We also realized from here on that the pretty much comprised the perfect Korean family.  They were loving and cute to the point of being completely disgusting.  Always holding hands and playing and fighting all cute like with each other.  There were 3 daughters and a son.  The son was the youngest and the eldest daughter was married to Brian.  Damnit this is where I'm not exactly sure what we did next but at some point we ended up at the temple of temples.  This place was just massive.  The building and the statues were just gigantic.  There were people everywhere praying and burning incense.  Again I wish I could have understood the guide so I would have known what the hell was going on.  One thing I enjoy about touring other countries besides Korea is that you can go to places that are 100's of years old, as everything in Korea was torched by the Japanese.  We had a little time to wonder around the temple complex and then it was time hit the road.  We had to shop again, but this time it was for green tea.  Really I'm not a tea person and I can't justify spending large amounts of money of tea that just isn't all that.  We did get to see the tea fields which is a little bit cool I guess.  The lady there taught us that if you tap on the table 3 times it is the same as saying thank you.  She also had a talent for smashing tons and tons of tea leaves into a really small container.  I was impressed.  Here I sat next to Ju-ohn and his creepiness increased exponitially.  The next stop was a tower of sorts.  When I saw tower it was an old one constructed from wood.  We didn't get to go up in it as it was around 11 stories tall an of course have no elevator.  I wanted to run up and down but really we had no time.  At this point I think it was on to the next city of Suzhou.  F.Y.I. Suzhou is pronounced like Soju.  I wish I brought a bottle of Soju to drink in Suzhou, hahahahaha.  We had the option of seeing circus but we decided not to b/c it cost $20 extra bucks.  I'd already seen one in Beijing and it was cool but not that cool.  So instead we got some dinner.  Again, sat with the perfect family and again had a different type of beer.  Next was the good stuff.  We hit up a foot massage.  The place seemed a little shady, like it could have been mob associated but it turned out to be ok.  My foot massage rocked.  But I was due for one.  Last year in Beijing I got my feet butchered by this dude.  Fenton on the other hand didn't seem to fair so well.  He said the chick was a little rough with him.  But over all I think he liked it.  This is where we figured out Mr. Lee spoke some pretty decent Chinese.  I spoke what little I knew to my foot massuse but the conversation really didn't go anywhere.  But it's cool b/c I felt like a million bucks afterwards.  We then hit the hotel.  The hotel was awesome as usual but it was a little removed from the city.  We thought about heading it but it was really windy cold and we were just too far out.  Lucky for us the youngest daughter of the perfect korean family helped up figure out how to get into our room b/c I was intent on putting the key in upside down.  Instead of heading out we ordered up some beer and checked out "The Golden Child" and "Mars Attacks."     Sat Jan 24  I slept a little better tonight.  Our room so warm and cozy it was awesome.  This was such a great change from my cold ass room here.  Breakfast was good but not as good as yesterday's.  There was almost some excitement as I pulled an Asma and left my passport in the room but luckily I was able to run up and grab it.  Fenton also left his camera up there so I snagged that as well.  That could have been serious trouble.  We at and then hit the bus.  Ok stuff breaks down here a bit.  I wished I'd kept a better record of exactly what we did, when and where.  If you guys haven't been on one of these tours you can't understand, but for those of you who have you know what I'm talking about.  Anyway at this point the bus driver is still smilling and the guide has only stopped talking to sleep.  Actually we now have a new guide for this city but she talked our fucking ears off too and at one point started singing in Chinese.  Damn stuff all seems to run together.  Ok first place was some temple, garden type place.  Again not totally sure what the deal was with it but I'll figure that out later.  The only important event here is that the youngest daughter in the perfect korean family was finally pressured into talking to me by her other sisters.  Turns out here English is really darn good.  Actually they all speak English well.  They are very representative of the new generation of Koreans who can really speak some English.  Turns out she is a fist year German major at the University closest to my work.  She really looks like her middle sister also, so much to the point we thought they might be twins.  Anyway this day is kind of hazy.  I'll have to get Fenton to help me figure out exactly what went on when and where.  We then hit up a temple which I didn't and still don't know anything about.  Man it was bitter cold here that's what I remember.  There really wasn't that much going on here.  I think at some point we ate lunch.  Again beer.  Chinese beer really isn't that bad.  Next place was a temple place with a leaning tower and canals.  This place is apparently the Italy of China.  Marco Polo lived in the city for seven years or something like that.  I think this is most of what went on.  We did have to go shopping at a silk place.  This wasn't too bad but I did have to sit next to Ju-ohn again.  Fenton brought an interesting idea concerning him.  What if he really wasnt' a creepy ghost but like some kind of prophet who was spouting off the secrest of the universe and we only thought he was crazy.  Always a possibility.  We saw fashion show in which Chinese girls showcased silk products that we could buy.  I think Korean women look a lot better then Chinese women.  I'm pretty sure this isn't just my opinion but really a fact.  In general I think Koreans are more attractive then Chinese.  Well the koreans went nuts when they saw the silk worm larva that they usually eat during the tour of the silk factory.  They ended up buying a ton of silk blankets.  Finally we got to head back to Shanghai.  I made a bold statement to Asma before I left.  I said that if I didn't get to go up into Shanghai tower that the trip would be a failure.  So I was pretty anxious to get back and get moving.  Of course we hit some killer traffic at this communist toll booth and we lose almost an hour before they figure things out.  But we finally made it through.  Now we're back in the massive city they call Shanghai.  Here we end up at an imperial garden or something.  The place was cool but not nearly as cool as getting there.  We had to traverse through mobs of Chinese and I think I know what cattle feel like now.  I really thought we were going to lose someone on our tour.  Next dinner, and of course beer.  This time it was Japanese Shya-boo Shay-boo.  This is where there is boiling broth and you dump stuff in that you want to cook.  It was good but not really filling.  Of course we sat with the family again.  At this point I should explain that there are two girls on our tour who to this point haven't spoken to anyone but each other.  They were the epitome of Korean shy.  I asked them if they spoke English after dinner and I didn't even get a "no" just a wave of the hand that I took for a negative. Ok now we're to the best part of the trip.  After dinner we had free time and Fenton and I broke off from the group.  We hand 3 goals: 1) go to and go up in Shanghai tower 2) eat and McDonald's 3) find a cool part of town to go out.  Literally the bus dropped us off in the middle of Shanghai.  We don't speak the language, we don't know where our hotel is, we did have the guide write it down for us in Chinese, and we didn't know exactly where we were going.  And I'm tired so I'll end it at this.  Note, still no spell check or proof reading.  Tune in tomorrow.    Ok it is time to finish this monstrosity of a post. No shit, there we were, in the middle of Shanghai.  We had the guide write down the name of the TV tower so we finally managed to grab a cab and he took us right there.  I love Chinese taxis, they are cheap and the driver is protected by this glass that goes only around his seat, so someone can sit in the front.  Well we made it to the tower without a hitch and decided to head up to the top.  There are different levels so you have to choose which one to go to and pay accordingly.  Well if you're going to do it you might as well do it right.  Well we did it right but it sure as hell took long enough.  It took us nearly an hour and a half to make it to the tippy top.  In hindsight I have to say maybe I'd have gone to the level below it if I'd known it was going to take so damn long.  But what's done is done and it all worked out for the best.  There were several interesting characters we encountered in the tower.  The first I noticed was guy  that looked like Gollum from Lord of the Rings.  Now I'm not trying to make fun of this guy or be mean but really this dude looked exactly like him.  It was a little uncanny.  Next was this complete dick who just kept cutting in line.  People would be waiting and he'd just bust up through.  This guy was a dick weed.  At some point he cut in front of us and kept cutting.  This annoys me b/c I'm more or less helpless as I can't really say anything to him.  But as fate would have it he had to be first and he was the first to pile onto an elevator and the last to get off so then we were back in front.  But it wasn't over yet.  He managed to wiggle his way back up behind us but Fenton and I made a pact to not let this dumbass pass us again.  At one point he was right behind Fenton and had his hand on his back pushing him.  What a jerk.  Anyway the top was cool and it was good to finally get there.  Shanghai is just beautiful at night.  And sure enough we had to wait in line to get back down to the first floor.  This time it was pretty quick so no complaints.  But before we headed down I asked one of the employees if she'd be nice enough to suggest a part of town so that we could grab a drink.  Sure enough she did and once down we caught another taxi and were on our way.  The ride was cool b/c we got to go under the river again.  Well we arrived, but I can't say this was the part of town we were exactly looking for.  There were bars and restaurants and places to hang, but she had sent us the most bling bling part of Shanghai, or so it seemed.  But this was really a blessing in disguise.  While looking around we spotted a McDonald's that was still open and we were able to get out western fast food fix that only McDonald's could supply.  Fenton being the thoughtful Romeo that he is came up with the bright idea to buy a kids meal in order to get the Nemo toy to take back to Jung-nam since finding Nemo was the first movie they saw together.  Man that's some brownie points.  The Chinese girls seemed to like the fact he was carrying around a Nemo box for the rest of the night also.  Ok so we ate, got our picture taken with the Communist Ronald and then it was off to find some where that we could actually afford.  Our plan, to find a white person who knew what was going on and ask them.  Well our savior came in the form of a German who was nice enough to get us to where we needed to go.  He seemed to know what was going on and spoke some killer English and sent us to the part of town where most the forgieners hang out.  Turns out he knew what he was talking about cause this was what part of town we were looking for.  It really wasn't that big but there were bars on either side of the road for about 200 yards or so.  We gave it a walk down and then decided on a bar called Woodstock.  As Fenton said "you can't go wrong with Woodstock."  The bar was pretty good actually but we ended up with a nutty waitress.  She sat down, told us we were handsome and asked if we wanted to meet later.  For what, I'm not exactly sure but we politely declined and got some beers.  I wish there was a bar I could compare it to here, the closest would be the old upstairs GR.  So we finished our first beer and I was ready to roll.  So I hit the can, but when I came back they were busting out some Def Leppard so we decided to have one more.  They busted out like 4 songs in a row, this was a nice treat seeing as how I'm a DL fan.  So after the second beer it was time for a change in venue.  Fenton had observed a lot of action across the street at a place called the Blue Frog.  So, to the Blue Frog it was.  Now I think it was about 1 am when we walked in, give or take.  This is where all the out of towners chilled, or at least a lot of time.  It was pretty much packed but we managed to grab some stools in the corner of the bar.  That was good, but there was lingering stench of puke, that was bad.  Fenton says he thinks it's b/c of dirty dishes or something, I'm not sure.  I couldn't find any puke around us, and the smell would kind of come and go so, go figure.  Either way it wasn't that bad.  This place took a turn for the better when we found out they had Beck's on tap.  Better yet you got them in pints and they were pretty cheap.  So now we're at a cool place with good beer at a good price.  Fenton was on the inside and next to the wall so it was my job to mingle and find out where to head next.  So I talked to a guy named Jacob from Denmark.  This dude's English was borderline perfect.  He was haning out with French guy whose name I can't remember.  They were both cool.  Of course they had only been in town 2 weeks and didn't know anything.  Well then Bob showed up.  They were talking to him and I hadn't wanted to get involved b/c Bob was old and really drunk so I waited til he hit the can.  But like a boomerang he came back.  But he turned out to be grade A number 1 entertainment.  Bob was probably pushing 60, drunk and in town to build stores for Giorgio Armani, or so he said.  He was from NY so we talked baseball for a little.  He did buy the next round of beer so I have to say that put a much better light on things.  Then he started laying into the French guy about stuff like WWII.  He started talking about how he wanted to by a French gun that was never fired b/c they only retreated and didn't fight.  What a quack.  Throughout our time there I'd made eye contact with a Chinese girl on the other side of the bar.  She had a friend and I tried to get Fenton to fly wingman with me and talk to the friend buit he wasn't having it.  So after enough guy talk I ditched them and went to say hello.  This turned out to be a good move as she spoke a hell of a lot better English than I think she should have.  Really her English is better than most English teachers in Korea and she says she wasn't an English major.  I don't know, nor do I care.  Her English name was Kitty, who gave her this name?  Anyway she was really cool and pretty to boot.  Her friend spoke English as well and I she like Jacob.  I tried to pull the hook up but he wasn't having it.  I hung out with here for the rest of our time there.  During this time I met a ton of people and realized that the make up of forgieners in Shanghai is totally different from that of Daegu.  I didn't meet one English teacher.  Everyone there was on business and they were all European.  There were a lot of French out that night.  I must have met half a dozen.  While I was chatting away Fenton attempted to explain the word "giver" to Jacob and the French guy.  I'm not sure they understood.  At some point Bob left, but not before that he fought for everyones' freedom face down in the muck in nam.  He again beat up on the French guy talling him that the best thing they did was get it on in Vietnam with the girls b/c the French-Vietnamese women were just super hot.  I bought his next round but he barely touch it before leaving.  I hope someone drank it, I think they did.  I missed this part of the conversation for aforementioned reasons.  We were rolling along having a great time and then Fenton clues me in that it's 4 in the morning.  Damn, where did the time go.  Well I had to say my good-byes to Kitty.  We swapped e-mails and numbers.  In fact I just recieved an e-mail from her today.  It figures, you met someone on the only night you're in a city.  Oh well.  So we're pretty not sober and this point.  We have no clue where our hotel is.  All we have is the name and location of it written down.  Essentially we're at the mercy of the cab driver.  I love honest cabbies.  This guy did us right.  He got us home in no time flat.  Better yet we got to go across this monster suspension bridge.  So we made it to the hotel, which was of course badass, we managed to get out key and go up for about 2.5 hours of sleep.  The mother fucking end.  I think.  No spell check, it'll take too long.  My spelling is horrible I know but hopefully you were able to figure out what the hell I was saying.

      I don't have much profound to say today.  I met up with Fenton after work and we ate and then grabbed some beers at the plaza.  It was cool.  Hopefully everything will be finalized tomorrow concerning our trip to Shanghai.  In a rather odd set of events last year Steve met a girl from Shanghai and still has her business card so I'm going to e-mail her and see if she wants to hang out.  She it roughly my age so maybe she'd want to head out for a night on the town with Fountain and I.  I guess we'll see.  I'm ready to get tomorrow over and done with and jump into vacation mode even it is for only 3 or 4 days.  I should be in bed but I'm not.  Yeah really I have nothing good to say.  I'm going to get some sleep, you should too.

      Ok I'll start out by giving a shout out to my friend Mike.  Who incidentally happens to be the same Mike Nawar on my comments section.  Anyway if ever there was a good guy friend he was it.  Always ready to drink, party, talk bad about women and make off color jokes.  Actually now that I think of it he Jack and I were all in the same frat.  Since he has some free time on his hands I've invited him to Korea so maybe you guys over here will get to meet him.  Hey man you were in both derivative securities and management of financial institutions too.  That's some pretty cool stuff.  Oh the good stories we have together.  What about TNT?  Right on man.   So The Last Samuria might be the best movie ever.  That could be an exaggeration but it is really darn good.  Last night was the first night in forever I didn't end up at GR or any of the like.  I got off of work and hung out with Hey-Sook all night.  We check out the movie and then got some food after.  We went to the sushi place call yoo-may.  It means dream in Japanese.  I haven't been here since I was there with Caleb, Helen, Shannon, his girlfriend and whoever else.  This would be about a year ago to put it into perspective.  The food was great, I haven't had sushi in forever.  I'm listening to The Last Samurai soundtrack as I type, again really good stuff.  You guys should all check it out.  I'm a sucker for the hero, honor, code of the warrior kind of movies.  Still this was pulled of very well.  After yoo-may we hit Bellagio for a drink.  I think I need to put Bellagio on the back burner for a little.  I end up there a lot it seems.  It is my favorite place to drink but still.  I think Connan must think I'm nuts b/c of course he is always working so I talk to him every time there.  We called it a night after that.  After that it was a night. Today was tame.  I hung out downtown and chilled.  I hit the bookstore to look up stuff on Shanghai.  I read the lonely planet thing but I didn't feel it helped out too much.  I was a little annoyed b/c it seems someone, or multiple someones, have bought up all the lonely planet books on southeast Asia.  I've been thinking seriously about just traveling around after I finish since I'll have time and money.  I was hoping to read about Vietnam or Cambodia or somewhere, but alas no.  I think kicked it Seattle's total foreigner style.  Yeah that's all.  I just can't wait for the vacation. I think I've decided to start caring less about stuff that doesn't matter and I can't control.  I've only got about 3 more months here and I'm going to make sure I enjoy it all.  I guess I'm tired of some of the social conditions that exist here amongst some of the foreign crowd.  I feel I'm a very PC and polite but I feel this is over looked and/or unappreciated.  Honestly I don't think it matters at all.  I think I've brought myself more misery acting this way than not.  But what do I know?  I just don't have it in be to be a jerk but at the same time I shouldn't be subjected to those I don't like.  At what point do you draw the line between doing what you want to do, saying what you want to say and acting the way you want to act, and being a complete ass?  I don't know.  I sound unhappy  but I'm not, I guess I'm just rambling.  Still need to sleep better, but I don't know how to.  I exercise, eat well and go to bed at a decent hour.  You figure it out.  Korea can wear even the strongest man down, I think that is why I need a break.  Life here is like a dream, it surely isn't the real world as I know it, many things will attest to that.  I hope my trip to Shanghai will be the breath of fresh air that I need.  I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about what I want out of life.  At this point I can still do pretty much anything I want to do.  I'm young, I have an education, I've proven I can provide for myself and sustain myself but  I don't have any direction.  Life was so easy until I graduated college.  You just followed a path but now that path has ended.  On one had it is my greatest problem but on the other it is my biggest opportunity.  I have so many directions I can walk, all I need to is choose.  It is just that the choice is the problem.  If it is one thing living in Korea has made me realize it's that time melts away so fast.  One year gone, 6 more months gone, next thing I'll be 40.  What is scary is I can feel myself getting older and I can recognize things in my life are changing.  By that I mean my priorities are changing, my way of thinking and my view on the world in general.  This is scary.  I was telling Caleb today about something I read call the paradox of happiness.  The idea is that the happier you are the less happiness you can experience.  I wonder if this is true.  It seems to make sense on paper at least.  Seems lately so many people around me are unhappy with their life here in Korea.  Some for certain reasons, some for others.  This has made me think about what would really make me happy with myself and in life.  The only conclusion I've come to is that happiness is really hard work, but definitely achievable.  When I first came back I wasn't brightest or the bright, but with some time and effort I've managed to really pull everything together.  On the same token I try to think about what makes me unhappy.  I think people strive for bliss to the point they are blind.  I've found half the battle is avoiding what you don't like, as simple as it sounds.  If you can eliminate what you don't like, whether it's being around someone or a situation it goes so far.  Ok this soundtrack is really good.  I don't know what I'm saying any more, but I think I can be entitled to one deep moment on my blog.  I'm thankful for what I've got and to those who gave it to me.  I just hope I don't waist it.  Man I don't know where all this came from but don't read into it too much.   Becky I wanted to put that thing on my page too but when I checked it out it said my most sexy feature was "my boobs."  So yeah I'm gonna leave it be.  I think there might be a guys night out on Tues. but I'm not coordinating it.  I've got plans.  If it materializes let me know and I'll join up later.

      Man I'm in shock you found my page Jack.  Jack Milam is my friend from the good old world of GT and somehow found my page on the net.  I've tried to find it but I've only ever just put my name in and looked for it and nothing came up.  It is really good to hear from you Jack.  I'll  give everyone a real quick history.  Jack and I were in the same frat and ended up in a couple classes together too.  What about that derivative securities class we had at like 8 am? That sucked ass.  But the best were the two old guys who taught management of financial institutions, what were their names?  Anyway this is my little journal of Korean happenings and misadventures.  And without further delay I'll get right into it.   This week has been up and down.  I was planning on taking a trip to Shanghai with Fenton next week so I called the travel agent and asked when could we come in and settle up and get everything squared away.  He said Monday was good for him so I was that's cool.  Well he calls back 15min later and says that the Chinese have refused to issue me a visa b/c my passport is full.  What the hell?  First of all it isn't full.  There aren't any blank pages but there are the amendments and endorsements pages in the back.  Anyway that doesn't fly.  So I end up having to blow off a work and go downtown and do all this paper work so that he can have someone run my passport to Seoul to have more pages added at the American embassy and then run over to the Chinese Embassy for the visa and then returned to Daegu.  But luckily he called yesterday and said everything was ok.  I'm not sure exactly what that means but it seems like a good sign.  I'm just waiting for something else to go wrong.  On an touching note I shared a moment with my cab driver as we both listened to Celine Dion's "the power of love" as I rode to the travel agency.  He didn't really speak any English but he loved some Celine Dion.  I have to admit, she isn't too bad. I fucking hurt my knee at Gypsy Rock last night.  I first twisted it or something in the gym on New Year's Eve and I some how reaggrivated it.  Man I wasn't doing anything crazy either, what a pain in the ass.  Last night started out slow but it was salvaged thanks to the hard work of Brad and Tim.  We were supposed to have boys night out but that kind of all fell apart as Sarah was going to have her B-day and that kind of took priority.  I ended up sitting in Seattle's for a bit but finally got a hold of Tim and then Gabe and then Brad.  We went to The Commune for a bit but I just have a very low tolerance for that place nowadays.  We had a pitcher and left.  Tim, Brad and I hit Bellagio which wasn't exactly happening but we downed a pitcher and some soju there and then hit GR.  This was a lot of fun.  There were a ton of people there for a Friday night.  Tim split out early, by that I mean around 3 maybe.  Brad and I got some food and then we called it a night.  I was a little miffed at how boys night fell apart at first.  I vowed I would never try and organize another night out.  But on further reflection I think I lied and I'll defenatly have to do it again.  I had such a good time with just 3 people if we were at full strength it would have nuts.  Anyway I'm tired and I'm just babbling now. Tonight I should be meeting Hey-Sook to watch a movie and then eat raw fish.  Things seem to be going well with her but you can never tell with these Korean girls.  Becky let me know when you want to eat sam gyup sal.  I've tried to call but you haven't been home.  Sam gyup sal, for those who don't know, is a cut of pork that is essentially bacon that is cooked on an open grill and is absolutely delicious.  I must say though that is should eaten in moderation for eating too much will do strange things to you, I know.  I think I have more to say but I can't think of it.  Oh wait, yeah I can.  If anyone wants the pair of silver earrings that I bought let me know.  Also why are silver hoop earrings so hard to come by in Korea?  Shit I left my scarf at GR last night.  Not that it's really important but I hope Kennon had the presence of mind to pick it up.  He brought some girl who had been told I was the most handsome foreigner in Daegu.  No lie that is what she told me.  That is the kind of press I like to get.  I wonder who told her that.   I am so looking forward to the time off next week.

      Becky do you really want to eat sam gyup sal?  If so you need to let me know when and where.  If not you should stop with the cruel joke, as it pains me so.  I've found the perfect place downtown.  Really cheap and really good.  I'll probably call you later b/c I won't be able to wait for you to reply. On my way out of a restaurant tonight I saw that  there is somewhere new opening and they have "the dancing girls" going on.  What is the deal with these chicks?  Every time somewhere opens they have balloons a little stage and two girls doing synchronized dancing out front.  I guess this is why I can't understand Korea.  How exactly to you get dancing chicks?  I think there is company that hires and trains these girls (by  train I mean teaches them these silly dances to these horrible songs) and then if you're a small business owner who opens a new shop you call them and they send some girls right over.  But that is just my guess. Today I got to teach my nasty class and they were in full lewd form.  The kid who seems to know everything told me today he likes to get blowjobs.  He said that girls do it too slow so then the explained that he grabbed their head and made them do it faster.  Really where does this kid get this stuff?  Then another student explain that a chick bit off his wee-wee.  He was a little offended I think. I'm getting excited about heading to Shanghai.  I'm hoping this tour is a decent one.  For the price you can't beat it with a stick.  The tour itself cost 429,000 won and that includes airfare, hotel, all food, and sightseeing.  I looked up tickets for the flight that we will be taking that same day and the round trip ticket alone costs over 500,000 won.  I'm looking forward to a change in scenery.  They have a really tall tower in Shanghai too so I can't wait to go up in that.   Why am I still so tired?  I thought I slept well last night but I guess I am still catching up or something.

      And finally I arrive at my own blog.  First and foremost it is snowing outside, that's a little cool.  It isn't just snowing a little either it was really snowing.  I smell chicken in this pc room, man I would like some of that.  So I did the normal rounds on the blogs tonight and I have to say it was very interesting.  I thought Caleb's latest entry was most interesting.  Actually it might not be the most recent but one of them at least.  That's all I'll say b/c if I try to explain why I'll just sound stupid.  Everyone updated and there was a lot of good reading.  I almost had a heart attack when I saw Andrew updated.  I'd pretty much given up on you Andy.   I seems like when it rains it pours.  I pulled 3 extremely late, or early nights in a row on Thurs., Fri., and Sat. and now I'm paying for it.  I slept like a fucking log like last night and I'm going to sleep well again tonight.   I'll fill in a few details left out from Thursday night first.  Shit, I left out the word fun from my last entry.  I just now realized this as I reread to see what I'd already said.  The sentence should read "Amicus is a lot of fun but it is......".  Ok now that is taken care of.  What I remember most is how full I was.  We had dinner and I ate my entire dish.  Then I felt the need to eat other people's' left over rice.  Next at Amicus we had a side dish of this super awesome sweet bread stuff.  It was so good but so filling.  Ok I already wrote about that too.  Forget Thursday I don't want to talk about it any more.  It was sad that Sarah had to leave but it seems that she arrived safely in GA which is always a good thing.   Onto Friday.  I met Asma and Fenton downtown at the board game cafe.  Asma and I played a little bit of Operation.  I won but she had a chance to clench and choked by dropping the writer's cramp pencil back into the board.  I think the Koreans were a little confused as to why we were playing that game.  Fenton showed up and we started playing Royal Turf.  This game is pretty awesome.  Othello is the horse of horse's and money should go on him all the time.  Anyway I had to split out early as I hate a date with the girl I met on New Year's name Hey-Sook.  Together with her is how the infamous sam gyup sal  got eaten.  Actually things went really well.  We ate and checked out a movie.   Saturday night was a bit odd.  I'm not sure what it was but something seemed to be odd or different.  First of all Alex got drunk crazy and took it out on me.  Oh well whatever, luckily I was able to salvage most of the night.  I don't think I'll be seeing much of her in the future.  Bellagio is definitely my favorite place to drink in Daegu followed by New Blue as a close second.  We had BBQ to eat and then did a bit of drinking at Bellagio.  I ended up playing pool with Gumi games at upstairs GR.  Ok be careful, this dude is a pool shark.  He put together a five ball run on me.  Granted I'm not really good by shit he rocked.  We ended up downstairs dancing away.  There were a lot of people there but they were mostly Koreans.  Where do the foreigners go nowadays?  I think the answer is TC.  Like Caleb I stayed away from the  cage.  We were all on the stage at some point breaking it down.  I for some reason or other went solo and just hit the dance floor by myself.  Lately this has paid a lot of dividends.  Once again the shareholders were happy.  I ended up meeting this girl named Yoon-Jung and ended up hanging out with her until it closed.   Sunday was tame.  Not really much doing.  I wish he subway ran later.  Why don't I have enough time?  I only work 4 or so hours a day.  I guess I need to manage my time better but really I feel like I try to.   Ok this Friday night guys night is in full effect.  Someone please let Gumi James know about it and any other cool dude who wants to hang out.  I think I'll set the limit at 6.  After 6 the group is too big and just gets cumbersome.  So the first four reservations go to Caleb, Gabe, Fountain and myself.  There was a break from it last week so we need to come back in full force.  Ok now I'm really tired and just talking the crazies like someone else I know.   Here is another good quote I like.  Someone famous said this but I can't remember who and I'm not going to bother looking it up.  I think it was a big wig philosopher.  "not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted"

      I really don't have a lot of time to write b/c I spent most of my time reading everyone else's blogs.  It is a little strange how enjoyable it to read them sometimes.  Gabe put up the mother of all posts which I just got done reading.  I just got a passport photo taken.  Fountain and I are going to try and take a trip to Shanghai over the Chinese New Year break and I need it to get my visa.  The Chinese suck man.  They've gotten rid of group visas and now you can only get personal ones which a hella lot more expensive.  Screw it, the trip is cheap enough and should be fun.  It will be good to get away for awhile.   Thursday was Sarah's last night.  I don't know how it got so late but I ended up at home in bed a little before bed.  Somehow we ended up in a singing room at some point.  But I guess she needed to go there before she left.  We went to Amicus and Pulse.  I like Amicus a lot but it is just too damn expensive and the beer really wasn't all that.  The live entertainment was all good though and a nice change.  We had some crazy bread side dish which was really great but I ate like half of it and couldn't drink for the next two hours.  Dinner at the best restaurant in Daegu preceded Amicus.  There seemed to be a little drama in the air from some reason or other.   My guilty confession for the day, I ate sam gyup sal again last night.  I think I need to check into rehab.

      Well it seems there is some interest in Scrabble.  The board game cafe is really awesome and I look forward to spending plenty to time hanging out there.  Tomorrow is Sarah's last night out so I think there are plans to get furiously crazy.  This being said I think I'll take another peaceful night at home.  It's getting cold again and I'm not sure I'm so happy about that.  My place just isn't warm and cozy, even with the heat on.  I think the PC room I'm currently in b/c they always keep it plenty toasty.  I think LIKE is going to go under before too long.  I taught out in Boe-mo yesterday and that place borders on deserted.  There were kids, but not many.  For some reason the gross mismanagement of LIKE is really beginning to annoy me.  Really it shouldn't b/c they pay me and treat me fair enough  but still it does.  I think it is b/c if they put forth any effort at all they could correct the problems.  Whatever though, like I said the pay me and I guess that is the bottom line.  I heard a rumor they are going to start combining schools until they get down to about 5 or so.  I have no clue if this is true.   Today went by really quick it seems.  It's already Wednesday.  Which of course makes tomorrow Thursday.  I just thought, tomorrow "The Last Samurai" opens.  I think I might have to hit that up this weekend.  I haven't seen a movie in the theater since LOTR.  I was wondering tonight why don't I watch more videos in Korea?  Really I have no idea.  I just don't.  I think between the movies I watch in the gym and the AFN movie of the night I'm able to get my movie fix.   In a change from sam gyup sal my roommate and I ate dwe-ji gal-bi tonight.  It's still pork but a different cut and really cheap.  My part of town I think this like the ghetto so stuff is cheaper.  I think things are cool between the roomy and I but lately he has been in his room with the door closed a lot.  This wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact it used to always be open.  But we still seem to be alright and he hasn't said anything so I won't worry.   I think I'll end this pretty much meaningless blog entry with one of my favorite quotes.  Nobody famous or important said it and you'll never guess where it came from but I like it none the less.   "The willow knows what the storm does not: that the power to endure harm outlives the power to inflict it."

      I have a small request for the readers of this humble page.  When I'm in the PC room blogging away I usually go to this Korean page which has tons of music.  But I can never figure out what to listen too.  I have thousands of songs at my finger tips and no clue what to listen too.  In the comments section list some of your favorite songs b/c I'd like to give them a listen.

      Here I am, rock me like a hurricane.  Actually tonight is a very tame night for me.  I think I deserve one.  The holiday  season has worn me the hell out.  Tonight I made curry rice and did laundry.  I'll get to bed early and hopefully sleep well.  Tomorrow I'm going to head downtown and try to check out a travel agency or two and see about taking a trip out of here later this month.  I also need to buy some new hoop earrings.  I bought some on Saturday night but they are a bit big and make me look pretty gay.  No, I don't want that.   Saturday night was cool and finally picked up.  I've come to the conclusion there aren't many good places to hang out at alone in Daegu.  I did go to Bellagio but it was packed.  I then went to Mojo's which was super dead.  At some point I met Mieka at TC and then we hooked up with Gabe and went back to Bellagio.  From there we ended up at GR.  GR really didn't seem all that happening for some reason.  I think a lot of the regulars were missing.  Oh I shouldn't forget before GR we went to funkaholic.  Nothing doing there.  At some point we did New Blue, then BB.  Saturday was fun but the crowd just didn't seem to be out.  I got home way too late again. Sunday was cool.  I hung out downtown for a bit.  I was drain though.  I felt completely out of gas.  So  where does one go to refill the fuel tank of life?  None other than McDonald's.  Yeah I know I'm American but this really is the remedy after a hard night.  My old roommate would always eat it on Sundays after a long night and sure enough it did the trick.  I met the girl whose number I got on New Year's later that night.  We hit Seattle's and then ended up at Bellagio, seems I'm there a lot lately.  It seemed to go well.  I figured we'd hang out for a little bit, but 5 hours later I finally went home.  I'll see her again next weekend so we'll see what's up.  She is a graduate student and here English is damn good.  Who knows?  Certainly not me anymore.   Speaking of Bellagio there was talk of going there tonight for the 3:1 cocktails but I'm way too tired and I've spent too much money out lately.  I was going to call Brad tonight but it is too late now.  I feel bad b/c I was like "yeah man, really I'll call you."  Shit, I'll call him later.  Payday is Saturday so that is cool. Today one of my bosses tried to get me to do some extra work teaching this kid math.  I put my foot down and told him know.  I think he was surprised.  I'm pretty laid back and go with the flow of most things but I've had it with LIKE.  He wanted me to come downtown and teach this kid.  I live at least 40 minutes away and I'm not sacrificing my whole day so he can make some extra loot.  I think he might call me back and try to change my mind but to hell with it.  They are in a sticky position with teachers anyway so it isn't like they will fire me.   Sara leaves on Thursday so I think that will be go out night.  I think I'll be out of this Friday night which will break my perfect attendance of guys night out.  But we can always change the night or something.  I think we should get together earlier on Saturday like around 7:30 and party it up then.  After that we can go find everyone else.   Also now that I think of it, I got another haircut today.  I have to say in the realm of Korean haircuts it isn't bad.  At this point I'm not really expecting to find a haircut I like, I'd just like to have one that I don't dislike.   I like the easy life, because it's easy.

      Actually I'll continue a bit more I guess.  Some of the stuff I usually forget to write just came back to me.  First of all I really like Def Leppard.  I fell the need to say that b/c everyone else thinks they suck and there is a mean joke about them that is floating around.  I was reminded of this as I was listening to them on the comp.  I've mentioned that the material I teach at work is crap but there is a particular chapter in a particular book that is very desturbing to me.  The story is about a lion that falls in love with a farmers daughter and wants to marry her.  He asks the farmer for her hand in marriage and the farmer is too scared to say no.  But he then has this great idea and tells the lion his daughter hates animals with sharp teeth and claws and says the lion he needs to pull them all out to make her happy.  So the lion goes and pulls them all out and then comes back to call on the daughter.  So what does the farmer do?  The breaks out the bat and beats the lion's ass and kicks out of the house.  The moral of the story is "don't give up something you need for something you don't need, you might end up with nothing."  No wonder we think Koreans are a little strange.  Ok first of all how would it have ever worked out between a lion and a human?  You know, what exactly were they going to do together?  I have way to much free time in class to think about such things as gross as they are.  But they were going to get married and we all know what that means.  Ok so lets get past that part.  The moral is so fucked up.  On one hand you have the lion who loves the daughter so much he is willing to have his teeth and nails ripped out to profess his love to her.  Then what does he get in return, his ass kicked.  No good.  There should have been a happy ending with something like them getting married and the moral should have been something about no sacrafice is too great for true love or something cheesey like that.  Our books suck.  No spell check on this, I'm going to Bellagio.

      Well here I am waiting for stuff to pickup downtown.  Seems a lot of people are MIA tonight.  Fountian and Caleb are taking it easy.  Gabe and Korean Lois might come out, no verdict yet.  Asma, Becky and Sarah are all up in Seoul, and I'm in the PC room.  I think I'd be drinking somewhere but I just ate a huge pork cutlet and I think it needs to settle first before the craziness starts up.  I went to the restaurant with the old lady on it.  First time I've been there but it won't be the last.  As a warm up they serve you icecream.  Unfortunately I got the purple kind which kind of tasted like Play-doh.  The food was great though.  I used to pride my self on having an exceptional memory but I just ran into someone on the street who called me out by name and I have no clue where I met this guy.  He did look vaguely familiar.  He said he wanted to meet me later in GR.  Maybe I'll be there, maybe not.  I was supposed to hang out with a girl tonight but turns out her mother fucked her hand up and she had to take her to the hospital.  Just my luck.  But no biggie I'll see her another time.  I called the new dude Tim and Andy's old number but nothing there.  I figure he probably got Andrew's old apartment since he is teaching in the same place.  I'm a little tired, this is the quietest and nicest PC room I think I've ever been in.  I might take a little nap here.  I thought about reading in Seattle's Best but I've been there way too much lately and I'll be there tomorrow in all probability.   Last night was actually a lot of fun.  I started slow and picked up.  It lasted a little long for my taste so I think that's why I'm a little tired.  It was supposed to be guys night out but Fountain and Gabe were no shows.  So it was up to Caleb and I to keep the tradition alive, and this we did.  We started by eating John Bacon Burgers at Bennigan's.  I know we played into every white stereotype there is but who cares the burger really is awesome.  When the waitress came up she asked us if we wanted the burger.  I wanted to explain I eat Korean food all the time and the only time you see foreigners eat is at Bennigan's.  But didn't say shit and instead just ate the burger.  It was damn good too I might add.  We then hit the board game cafe.  I think I might be falling in love with this place.  Caleb and I played some crazy game that required a lot of thinking and I was just not up to the task.  We were helped out by a nice girl who worked there and spoke some pretty darn good English.  She said she was glad to meet us b/b/c we were very handsome.  This being the case I got skunked.  Kennon showed up shortly after and we then switched games.  This next game I kick some ass at.  It was a horse racing game where you move all the little horses around the board and you have to bet on horses and so on.  Every time at least 2 of my horses placed and I always made the most money.  Brian, Sarah and Alex also joined and we played some scrabble.  I felt I made some pretty good words, but we could never hit any of the really good squares to get a fat score.  We closed the place down at 2 and then moved to "The Pulse".  This is a new place which currently has dancing girls outside of it.  How do I know?  Because I just walked by it.  He we made a mad blitzkrieg attack on our sobriety my downing soju and beer.  I think it worked a little.  We played some really awesome drinking games to boot.  The finger game made a come back and the categories game was a hit as well.  Next was BB.  It wasn't really happening but it was fun.  We danced and they played the "welcome to Atlanta" song upon my request.  I was pooped and headed home after.   So what will happen tonight?  I don't know.  I'm going to meet up with Meabh and Eillee and whoever else at TC.  Man I hate that place but oh well.  I hope to make it somewhere else later.  I think I enjoy starting early like 8 or 9 at a Korean style place.  I think I'll hit Bellagio before I go to TC.  Tune in tomorrow to find out the exciting conclusion.

      What a night.  I think that sums it up.  For more details please read on.  I will do my best to recall the events of early 04.  Things started at Asma's around 10 or so.  There was some confusion as to if a new teacher was coming but luckily it was a false alarm and the party roared on.  There was Jaeger to be had and peach schnopps (sp?).  I have to confess I'm not a big fan of the J but I really liked the mix.  I think I had about 4 shots.  I also confess that I ate almost all of the Pringles Mieka brought over.  I hope I spelt your name right this time.  I can't see my comments on this computer so I can't check, sorry.  Anyway, there was nice crowd that showed up which included a new guy from NY who seems cool enough.  Cool people are always welcome in the friend group.  Fenton broke out the Q pack which, while filled with alcoholic goodness, proved to be his ultimate undoing for the night I think.  I think I said the word "giver" yesterday more than I've every said it before in my life.  We rolled out to the park and saw the bell ring and then jumped around and acted stupid.  Some old woman start video taping us just b/c we were foreign and really drunk.  Gabe, fountain and I split another Q pack, which I think I took care of most of it.  It really wasn't that cold which made for a nice New Years.  I ran into the lady I usually by kimbap from there in the park.  That was a little awkward.  I wanted to say "no I'm really not holding 1.6L of OB and I'm not really that drunk and these aren't my equally drunk insanely loud friends".  Instead I smiled, bowed and said Happy New Year.   Next we went to TC.  I thin I'm going on a Commune strike.  I just can't take it any more.  Strange stuff happened here.  First while I was standing outside waiting for Son-young to finish using my phone I saw a pretty good Korean fight.  I'm still out to lunch on her.  I don't really know her but I don't get a real positive vibe from her.  Next I saw Becky bust ass on the pavement.  I didn't laugh that much, but it was a little funny.  I went to help but Simon and someone else had already helped her up.  Apparently she fell down the stairs later but I wasn't witness to that.  Stuff then go stepped up a notch when some dude named Nick hit fountain in the face.  This wasn't cool.  Luckily it didn't go any further.  We eventually made it out.  Instead of going directly to GR we made a stop at my favorite O-deng stand.  Here I have to thank Asma and Caleb for feeding me.  Oh, Alex showed up at TC rip roaring drunk so I had to send her on her way home.  GR was cool.  There are a lot of Pakis here, that or they just all hang out at GR.  I met a girl there and got the digits.  She is an English teacher, I think.  Either way she speaks it well.  I'll call tomorrow.  We were there  awhile, it didn't close at 4 as usual.  We then ended up at She's.  I was dead tired.  We ordered food but it took forever.  When it came Brian took at dish and then Bethany and Kennon took one.  Caleb was asleep and I was out of patience so I left.   As much as I had to drink I really wasn't that bad off.  I feel I am leaving out bits and pieces but I'll add those as they come to me.   Today was really awesome.  I have Alex, Asma, Sarah, and Becky to thank for a very pleasant evening out on the town.  There was coffee, dinner at Outback and then a game of Boggle and Scrabble at the game board room.  I'm pooped but I'll sleep tonight.  I was accosted by Becky's stalkers today in Seattles.  After they left to go get glasses I moved and found a different seat.  Apparently these two guys who wait in Seattles and hunt down unsuspecting foreigners to speak English saw me and moved beside me.  They did this thing where they would converse a little in English in hopes that I would say something to them.  I was busy writing in my journal and paid them no mind.  Finally one of them was like "hello".  We had a little small talk and he invited me to sit with them but I declined and told them I was busy.  The then split out in a hurry.  What goobers.  Dinner at Outback was really good.  I ate a blooming onion, bread, onion soup, steak and french fries.  I also had a Coke on the side which wasn't flat.  The board game cafe is a little bit badass.  They have axis and allies which I'm ready to beat someone down in.  I think we'll be spending some time in there.   So I wonder if this year will really be different from all the rest.  You know it's a new year but really what changed?  Only the date.  I think my goal this year will be to find some direction in life.  I really don't know what I want to do.  All in all 03 was pretty good to me.  10 months of it was spent in Korea and I'm ok with that.  I've have a good time here and I've met some really awesome people.  I'd like to give a shout out to everyone but I'm just too tired right now.   I need to get a trim sometime soon but I'm a little scared.  Haircuts always seem to go wrong her in Korea.  Maybe I'll just keep growing it out.  But then what?  Hell if I know.  I hope everyone is revived enough for boys night out tomorrow.  I think Fenton and Caleb had it a little rough last night.  Gabe is  a maybe.  I think I'll call that Tim dude.  He hasn't been here a week yet but hell he can stand to drink more.  Thanks to the magic of bugs music I'm listening to the Rocky IV soundtrack.  Yeah this is just a bit awesome.  I love that "no easy way out" song.  This is where Rocky is driving along in his Jag and he is reflecting back on his time with Apollo and all the good times they had and then his tragic death to the evil Ivan Drago.  This is the part where I knew Rocky had to fight Ivan and that no matter how much stronger the Russian was Rocky would ultimately triumph.  Asma likes Indiana Jones 2 better than 3.  What's up with that?  Ok I really haven't gotten a lot of sleep. fountain and I bust out some video games on Tuesday night.  Why is all the food around his house so expensive?  I had numb thumb for the first time in forever.   Enough is enough, stop the madness.

      Stuff is going well.  I totally blew off the teachers meeting today opting instead for a morning of peaceful rest.  I'm really been going too hard these past few weeks.  I ended up out until around 2 last night with Gyeh-son and I thought I was going to die.  I plan to stay in tonight and just enjoy doing absolutely nothing.  I was going to go to the meeting, but why?  I see everyone I want to see and I really don't feel the need to meet any of the new teachers or listen to people babble on and on.  I was supposed to have lunch with a teacher I used to work with so I feel a little bad about canceling that.  I wonder if they'll make me watch a tape and write an essay or something.  Not that I'll do it but whatever.  When I came home last night my power was off.  As of when left today it was still off.  Really didn't mind so much.  It was a much bigger pain in the ass when I didn't have water, now that sucked.  I ended up seeing the movie "Something's got to Give" last night.  It was actually pretty good and well written.  Did anyone know  that there are 5 different board game cafes downtown?  Guess you find this stuff out when you date a girl who works at one of them.  It is such a strange feeling to be well rested, I'd forgotten what it was like.  I'm looking forward to the upcoming time off.  I don't have to work Saturday, lucky me.  While it is great to have the time off I feel like I should  be doing something more than sitting around and just chilling in Daegu.  But then again I'm not really motivated to travel anywhere else in Korea right now.  I wish I could have gotten out of the country.  But that is money saved that I can used after I finish up here.  The end is near for me.  I might extend for another month if they let me.  Things are really swell now.  I'm hoping to fucking giver this weekend and then blog about it on the giver blog.  I don't have a link up for the giver blog yet,  but I will soon.   I've had a drink since Saturday and I haven't been to Bellagio since Friday.  These are very good things.  I need breaks from both desperately.   It is getting time for me to get a haircut and I'm getting a little nervous.  I hate getting haircuts in Korea.  I'll have to find someone to go with.  I'm not sure what I want exactly but I'm starting to look a little shaggy.  I love having days of only 5 classes.  I have one today and one tomorrow and then no work on Saturday.  I don't think anyone who works for LIKE currently ever reads my blog so I guess I can brag.  Even though if you don't work for like you probably get Saturday off anyway so to hell with you.

      Ok so about Friday.  Well I didn't bat 1.000.  In fact I did pretty darn poor on my predictions.  Well there were a few tearful good-byes.  So I was right on that.  We also did make it to TC.  That was a given but still I'll take it.  We totally didn't go to GR much less dance in the cage.  Strike one.  Also no singing room.  Strike 2.  We did make it to Bellagio.  So chalk one up for me.  Not everyone was trashed, but enough people to where I think it shouldn't count against me.  Also we didn't eat at New Blue.  Strike 3, I'm out.  So I guess I'm 3/6.  You know in reality that isn't a bad batting average at all.  Anyone who could hit .500 in the big leauges would make more money then they knew what to do with.   So anyway I was a little late to dinner b/c I had to go see Gyeh-son first.  Turns out she got Asma a going away present and the boss at the cafe was asking about her as well.  Dinner was pretty darn good.  I'm a fan of Outback.  There were maybe 20 or so people there.  After dinner I had to run off for about an hour and see Gyeh-son since she finished work.  She briefly came to TC and said good-bye to Asma.  She was tired and I'm guessing didn't want to deal with a ton of crazy drunk foreigners and decided to go home.  So this left me back at TC.  I somehow ended up with some kind of long island ice tea which just completely sucked.  Really this was the worst drink in history.  I always thought I'd drink anything as long as it was free, well this came to an end.  This drink was originally ordered by Asma I think and she didn't like it so it was given to me.  Absolutely horrible.  I didn't drink much.  We finally got a move on and went to Bellagio.  At first it was just Asma, Jeff, Brian and myself.  But sure enough reinforcements showed up.  We had that place on lock down.  There were 20+ people in our party.  Next was BB.  I didn't stay long here.  I was so tired and just decided to save what little I had left for Saturday.  Here I said my good-bye to Gabe and called it a night.  Things hadn't always been the best between the two of us but I'd like to think we ended on a good note.  Best of luck to you where ever you end up.  Lois also left but I think she was sick and didn't seem to be talking a whole lot.  I did get to take a parting photo with them though.   I finally got a good night's sleep last night.  Tonight should be game night at Fenton's with Caleb and I.  Unfortunatly I'll have to call it around 11 b/c I promised Ju-mi I'd watch that Shil-me-do movie with her.  I've already canceled once and this is probably the last week it'll be playing.   It doesn't look like Taiwan will work out.  All seats are full.  I'm waiting for the travel agent to call back if anything develops but I'm not holding my breath.  Only 5 classes today, that is totally giver.   Screw spell check, I'm going to work.

      Too tired to blog.  I was going too but I've managed to mess the screen up and I think I'm going to pass out.  Stuff is good but busy.  I'm really enjoying life right now.  I got my time off but I still need someone to roll to Taiwan with.  I hope this comes through.  Somebody says Cambodian chicks are hot.  That is good to hear.  I'm looking forward to meeting some.  LIKE meeting this week, yuck.  I like o-deng, maybe just a little too much.  To hell with spell check.

      I think I've manage to bring the end of my life significantly closer over these past two weeks or so.  And the madness continued last night.  I met up with Gina for dinner at WABA.  She has to be the coolest girl in Korea I think.  Anyway I had a great time hanging out with her and chilling.  We then rolled over to Baskin Robbins and picked up some icecream for dessert.  Caleb joined us and then we desperately went looking around for a place to get some beer.  Little did we know it would be almost impossible.  After being turned away at 3 places  we finally found a winner in the form of this new place call Kaiser which is across from Gallery Zone.  Nothing special but it was fun.  The House showed up shortly after and the beer began to flow like water.  At some point we started to play the finger game.  This was the beginning of  the end for me.  Really, I just can't win this game.  I lost count of how many times I lost.  We should have switched games but nobody was up from that.  At some point after losing I found myself in the bathroom relieving myself when I was accosted by a Korean who really wanted to be friends.  Bathroom meetings are always awkward.  So he ended up grabbing my hand and was dragging me back to his table.  Oh I should add this guy was rip roaring loaded.  Kudos go to his friends though who saw what was going on and they ran to my rescue.  This of course let to the two tables mingling, the really drunk guy one shotting a glass of our beer and them buying a pitcher for us.  It was actually a great deal of fun.   Well the sad hour of 1 finally rolled round and we had to go see Asma off.  The weather was terrible but we managed.  This was a little bit sad.  When I think of true friends Asma comes to mind and will be missed.  I gave my small going away present and then helped lug a suitcase down the stairs.  I feel like dud having not  gone to the bus station.  I didn't know so many people were going, I thought it was only Jeff and Caleb.  Asma best of luck in everything.   It is really sad to think that just like that someone you've known so well and hung out with so much is just out of your life and you don't really know if you'll ever see them again.  I guess I always hang onto the idea that we could meet again.  So I just fool myself out of saying "good-bye" and into saying "see you later."  My Saturday night continued with Gina and I going to The Pulse.  This place is pretty cool.  We got another pitcher and hung out.  Caleb joined back up with us after coming downtown again.  We decided to scope out Au which is the new place above The Pulse.  I don't know what the trend is with naming places after symbols on the periodic table but it seems to be working.  I like Fe and Au ain't bad.  It was kind of dead but that is to be expected since it's new.  It is pretty swank on the inside.  The need salsa to go with the chips and they need to get bartenders who know what the hell is going on.  The balcony is just awesome.  I really look forward to sitting up there and watching all the ants march by as soon as the weather is decent.  Fountain, Jung-nam and Alex joined us at some point and this is where stuff got interesting and a little awkward.  I haven't seen her in forever and the last time we did meet we didn't part on such good terms.  Well she was totally wankered as usual and I hung out for a little bit and then decided it was time to go.  Gina and I then ended up at New Blue and had some lemon soju and then called it a night.  I literally managed to get no sleep last night.  Now here comes the best part, I had work at 8:30.  Luckily I was done at 12:10.  Yuck, that sucked.  My first class was cake, but the other two were terrible.  These kids were just brats.  I wouldn't want to be there either on Sunday morning but hell man I'd at least put my best foot forward since my parents are shelling out money.  The classes were too big and the kids just didn't give a damn.  But that made it easy for me b/c I didn't give a damn either.  It was so good to make it back to bed where I got a little rest.  I totally was supposed to met someone for coffee at 3 and that feel through, go figure.  Man I felt like an ass too.  I'll make it up to her later.  I'm feeling alright now but I'll sleep well tonight.   There are plans for a "giver" blog in the works.  I'll keep you guys updated.  I'm also officially part of the hand phone giver club.  Ask about how you can join.  You need a hand phone hadn't already guessed.   The weather sucked today.  I really don't mind the rain so much, just not on the weekends.  It is great during the week b/c it cuts down on the military flights and veggie trucks.  This in turn means less noise for yours truly.   I'm trying to get to Taiwan this Friday.  We'll see if it works out.  If not then I'm just going to sit at home, hang out and do nothing.  That is what I need, a couple days of nothing.  I still need someone to go with.  If anyone wants to go to Taiwan and has from Friday to Monday off let me know.  I think I'm done for now.   Duke, duke, duke of  earl.

      Man I just need to take a break from life.  I haven't gotten a good sound night of sleep in longer then I can possibly remember.  It won't happen tonight either as it is good-bye night for Asma, Gabe, and Lois.  The party should start at Outback around 9:30.  I'll go as long as I can but no promises.  I wonder what the night will bring on there last night out.  I think I'll make a few predictions.  Someone will cry at some point.  Not a bad crying, but a sad type of good-bye cry.  I think we might end up at a singing room also.  In fact I feel pretty strong about this prediction.  I think there will also be cage dancing at GR.  I expect most everyone to be completely trashed, but that is a given.  I know we are eating Outback, but in the wee hours of the morn I think we might hit up New Blue one last time for some grub.  Of course TC and Bellagio will be visit at some point.  Good-byes have to be said to certain people who work at both places.  These are all pretty safe bets so I'll just stick with them.  Asma says she'll stay out all night, we'll see. Things  with Gyeh-son are going really well.  She is heading out of town this weekend so I'll be free to "giver" as much as possible.  Turns out she is in medical school and studying to be a surgeon.  Crazy.  How did she end up at the board game cafe.  I think we're dating now.  I think she is a genius or something.  She is also president of her class.  Bonkers man.  Anyway she seems really cool. Another day of LIKE.  My hatred for them has cooled off for the time being.  The are still fools intent of crippling their own company but I don't care.  Time has started to really pick up at move.  I don't know what the hell is happening.  I'll be 40 before I know it.

      Man I'm tired.  This is the first night is forever that I haven't been downtown going completely "giver."  Literally this is my first night home in over a week.  I think I'll enjoy it buy going home and doing other then watching tv.  I have so save what little energy I have left for Friday.  I dread going to Outback with 30 or so people.  I think that will be nothing but chaos.   I saw pretty decent movie, as far as Korean movies go, last night.  It as about two bothers in the Korean war and I have to say it was fairly graphic and somewhat moving.  There was still the slightest hint of Korean cheesiness to it but whatever.  The name of the movie literally translated is something like "Korean flag blowing in the wind."  I saw it with Gyeh-son and have to say that things went well.  She seems like a cool girl and I'll probably see her again.   The rest of you bloggers need to update.  Only Gabe had something fresh for me to read today.  I have nothing else to say.  I think it's time to go home and pass out.

      I think my life my be stuck in high gear permenatly.  This isn't bad in and of itself but I can feel it taking a toll on my body.  I wish I just had a few days to sit at home and just hang out.  Last night was Tim's B-day.  We ate at Outback.  It was a good meal.  We were joined by several of his female friends, whose names I've all forgotten as well as Asma, Andrea and Caleb.  Gabe showed up later at Bellagio later for some drinks.  There was a drink special last night at Bellagio and we ended up getting 5 drinks for free.  Not too bad.  I owe Asma b/c she spotted me for my drinks.  Thank you.  I hadn't planned to eat at Outback and thus didn't have enough money for both booze and food.  Conan also gave us some chocolate for free.  I think I forgot to mention we got him a cake on Saturday night and then sang to him.  He is a cool guy.  We even lured him into playing a round of Titanic.  It was obvious the shot glass was close to sinking to I told him to be careful.  He just responded with "don't worry, I'm a bartender."  Then as he was about to break out some real pouring skill Asma thwarted his technique by smacking the bottle and thus causing him to sink the cup and drink.  Anyway back to yesterday.  There was a serious discussion of politics that happened.  I wish I wasn't so tired but since I was, I was just happy to sit on the side lines and listen.   Tonight is movie night with Gyeh-son so we'll see how that goes.  I'm not at all sure what's going on there.   I'm loving the weather as of late.  Just keep getting warmer please.  I need to clean my room and do laundry.  No spell check, fuck it.

      Why am I downtown when I should be at home chilling out?  Well the answer would be Tim's b-day.  While I can't say I know him very well he does seem pretty cool so this warrants hanging out.  I think I'm setting a record for being downtown, at least for myself.  This is the 7th day in a row I've come downtown.  But not to stop there, I'll be here again tomorrow.   Becky I'm glad to see you an update while you're moving around.  I'm really thinking of hanging out in that part of the world for a little when I'm done here.   For you guys who like quizzes here is a  urlLink good one .   It seems that for some reason all the damn trucks  trying to sell shit are louder and more annoying than ever.  What the hell is going in my neighborhood?  If I wanted onions or fruit of what the hell ever I'd take my ass to the store.  I don't need the loud ass store coming to me at 9 in the morning.   Oh yeah I was going to talk about Saturday night.  Nothing to special went on, at least for me.  I was running on fumes and should have stayed in.  But it's Saturday and we can't be having that happen.  Dinner was at Bennigan's.  I had the burger again and it was just as good.  We then had some serious problems trying to figure out where to go next.  Eventually we landed in this bar called Friend.  I haven't been to this place in over a year.  This is another case or recognizing the inside of the bar and not the outside.  Well we chilled here and sipped on some beer for awhile.  I talked to Kevin a good deal about his travels and this has really motivated me to check out SE while I'm here.  We at some point ended up in Bellagio.  Man I think I might as well take up permanent residence there.  It was fun, we played a some drinking games.  While I wasn't exactly on point with the finger game I did manage to not lose Titanic once.  Next of course was GR.  Nights at GR seem to have themes.  This nights theme was Korean guys.  They were all over the place.  The Paki patrol was out in force and giving people like Asma and assorted Korean girls problems.  These guys are really nuts I think.  There was a fight that almost broke out downstairs.  It took the bouncers forever and a day to get  down there and break it up.  I  dipped into BB for a bit and then realized it was way to late and I needed some sleep.  It was a cool night.   Sunday was tame as usual, which is good.  This was my first day without a drink since Tues.  What has happened?  Jeez I worry about myself.  I know I'm fine but I just don't want it to become a habit.  Well I met Caleb for board games and then Asma showed up later.  Turns out I missed out on al the good stuff that happened Sat.  I'll let Caleb blog about it b/c my second-hand account just wouldn't do it justice.  We busted out some serious board games.  I really love board games.  The girl who works there and speaks English, Gyeh-Son, was nice enough to sit down and kick our asses.  We ended up getting some grub afterwards with her.  In theory I should see a movie with her later this week so we'll see if that materializes.   I'm hungry.  I think I'm hitting the wall with Korean food.  I really need some more variety.  The fact that I can't cook doesn't help either.  How can Koreans eat the same thing all the time?  The eat kimchi and rice everyday for breakfast.  I like that stuff, but for breakfast?  That's nuts.  I wish there were some more foreign restaurants in this town.  I'm sure there is more I want to say but I'm just too tired.  You know I also think about stuff I want to blog about at the strangest times and I can never remember when I'm actually here.

      Ok well turns out they have my favorite game but I can't change the controls to the way I like them so I'll just blog instead.  I knew that would happen and I hate it.  Ok I'll pick up where I left of which was with Caleb and I in Bellagio.  We had a fair amount to drink here.  We got things started with a playboy shot and a cran and vodka.  Then we moved onto a drink of my choice and back to cran and vodka.  Sometime during the madness Conan was cool enough to give us a free side dish of our choice.  This worked out really well b/c remember what I said about the "blessing in disguise" thing.  At some point we met some Korean guys and they ended up sitting with us.  Of course this brought us into contact with soju.  I was sitting in the thick of them and thus consumed a heck of a lot.  I think we went through two bottles there.  Gabe and Lois showed up and we finally split out of Bellagio.  Jumi ended up calling me out of the blue and I then hung out with her.  She was hungry so I ate again.  Get this, she wanted to eat sam gyup sal.  I couldn't say no, so I didn't.  It a pretty good place that we went to also.  We had some more soju.  Then we went to a new place, new for me at least.  It was call Haroo.  Really awesome place and packed with people.  We again had more soju and some o-deng soup.  This stuff was really good.  After this I was done.  I was suprised at the fact that I wasn't completely and totally waisted.  I think all the eating helped me out and kept me from dying.  I kind of wished I'd made it to GR but I had a really good time with her regardless.  I never have enough time to blog fully.  Where is my free time?  I'll blog more later.  I'm out.

      Stop the insanity.  I think I'm going to kill myself.  This has been the single craziest week of my life.  I've been out and downtown drinking and partying for the last 4 nights.  Tonight being Saturday night I don't think the streak is going to end yet.  On Thursday I met Fountain, Asma, Gabe and Caleb for dinner at Bennigan's.  The John Bacon Burger is possibly the single greatest food in the world.  There are just times when you need a burger and fries.  Thursday was that time and boy did it ever hit the spot.  We couldn't exactly figure out what to do next but finally we decided on hitting the "train" bar.  I really really should have gone home but I was like "well I'm out, why not?"  This place has a specail place in my heart b/c it was the first place I sawe the "eyes" video.  But this time around it wasn't nearly as cool.  All we wanted was a pitcher of beer  but they were all cranky and wanted us to buy a fucking side dish.  Well we finally got some beer after Gabe had a talk with them.  Then the beer was kind of funny tasting, but I drank it all anyway.  Next we moved to Fe.  This place is actually pretty darn cool and was happening.  We took care of business there and then Gabe and Asma had to call it a night.  After much harrassing Fenton and I convinced Caleb to come to Bellagio for a drink.  Caleb sucked it up and came but it as obvious he was pooped.  So at this point this was my third visit to Bellagio this week.  Much to my surprised Connan wasn't working.  Anyway as we got settled in some really cool arm chairs a huge group of Koreans was leaving.  I couldn't believe it but they left and almost full picther of beer.  Well this just wasn't going to do.  So we snagged that and ordered another.  At this point I think all of us were super tired and slightly drunk.  Caleb was exhausted and needed to sleep.  Fenton and I were just strung out and crazy.  Caleb finally called it a night and rolled home.  Fenton and I managed to polish off all the beer which I was pretty impressed with.  Fenton also brought a very important life question.  What is a bigger tradgedy, an empty glass of beer or a full glass?  Because a full glass should be emptied and an empty glass should be filled.  Well my answer is this.  I think an empty glass is a bigger problem.  The reason being, I figure it is better to have beer and not need it, than to need beer and not have it.  We then went to meet Jung-nam as she got off of work at 3.  At this point it was time for me to go home.  I thought I wanted to do a little bit more but reason finally took hold of me and made me go home.  Thank goodness. I don't think I have enough time to complete the entry on last night but I'll do my best.  It started with Caleb and I eating at Italy and Italy.  This place is really cool and I've never been there before.  The make your own pasta is just a little bit awesome.  Now I did order the very hungry serving and I have to say I could have eaten a bit more.  But as it turns out it was a blessing in disguise.  Something interesting I noticed was that they have a LIKE newspaper advertisement stuck up on the back of the Coke fountian.  I don't know why but it was kinda cool b/c a picture of yours truely was on it.  After this was a quick pitcher at TC.  I went quietly didn't complain a bit.  We met a new DDD guy name Tim from England.  Not much else happening there.  Then it as to, you guessed it, Bellagio.  Ok I think I've set a few world records.  First, is most visits to Bellagio.  Second, most visits in one week to Bellagio.  Really I need to back off and I recognize this.  Ok I'm out of time.  Tune in next time for exciting conclusion.  Note, no spell check.

      Oh yeah I was right, I got the boot.  But it's cool.  Things ended up really well.  I saw her last night to get the downlow and say good-bye.  Apparently she figured out I wasn't in for the long hall, not that I ever pretended to be, and decided it best to call it.  I think there are no casual fun relationships with Korean girls.  You're either gonna get married or not.  Anyway what should have been just coffee turned out to be coffee, more roasted pork, lots of soju and then a singing room.  How the hell did that happen.  I think I got home at a little before 6.  I'm a little beat.  I was going to head downtown and shop today but forget that.  I think I'll go after work if I have the energy.   While I was downtown yesterday I went to X-Milano to have a look around.  Seriously I found nothing that looked even remotely appealing.  Not only do Koreans wear this shit but they pay for it first.  I just can't explain how ugly these clothes were.  I've started paying close attention to what people are wearing to, is it just me or can they not dress?  Now I know there are cultural differences so I'm curious as to what they think of the way we(foreigners) dress.  Do they think we're a bunch of goobers.  This I think particularly the sweaters have bothered me this season.  There are some really hideous ones out there.   Becky I'd like to wish you a fond farewell.  I'll always remember you sprawled out all of the taxi the first time we met.  So I'll explain now that the reason we met on Tuesday night was to say good-bye to her.  Let me know how your trip goes. Time to teach those little Korean kids some English, or something like that at least.

      I think I might have been dumped by my girlfriend but I'm not quite sure.  I haven't talked to her in 2 days so that leads me to believe there is something wrong.  She hung out with a guy "friend" on Sunday night.  Which, that's cool I'm a trusting individual.  I asked her to call me when she got home.  Well I'm still waiting for her to call.  Maybe she ran off with him.  Beats me.  Either way I'm not going to call or sweat it.  I think it might be a silly Korean game where I'm supposed to call her or something.  Whatever, I'm too old for games.  She said she'd call so she should call.  If she doesn't want to then oh well.  I hope it isn't something serious though like she's in the hospital or something.  Then I'd feel like an ass.  But the chances of that are so slim I don't think that's a real possibility.  We'll see.   Last night was fun.  There was dinner at WABA and then socializing at Bellagio.  We even got a free side dish b/c we ordered 3 cocktails.  It wasn't a particularly late night so that was good.  I'll explain the reson for going out last night tomorrow or Friday, for reasons I'll explian then as well.  I think I'm going to go shopping tomorrow during the day.  I'm itching to get some new clothes.  I'm tired as of late.  I need to sleep better.  Spring where are you?  Hurry up and get here.

      Fucking hell.  Ok well I just lost my update b/c the fucking computer crashed.  Luckily I hadn't written too much.  Still, you get into the writing mode and then it's suddenly broken.  I really don't feel like going back and rehashing what I said before too.  Damnit.  Whatever.  Anyway I met Asma and Peter downtown tonight and we hit up the board game cafe.  This place rules.  Not only do they have great games but the girl who works there and speaks English is super cool.  I haven't been there in a month and she remembered my name.  To top it of she said it was b/c I have a handsome face.  I think I'll go there more often to get my ego massaged.  I love Korea.  Anyway I don't know what else I wrote but I'm not going to bother and rewrite it.   Oh I know something I was talking about was that I've found out my new love with bugs music is listening to oldies.  For a Korean run server the selection is pretty darn good.  Stuff is kind of hard to find but its there if you look hard enough.   I'm thinking about doing something with my hair but I'm not sure what.  We'll see.  I'm also debating more piercings but that is still up in the air.   Oh my oil is out so I have no heat.  Great.  At least it's not as cold has it could be or has been.  I should be thankful for that I guess.  I'm looking forward to payday.  I think I'll go shopping soon.  I feel the need to buy new clothes.  I think it's one of my short term goals to find decent clothes in this country.   Hey-Sook was busy today so I just did the usual Sunday grind and it was pretty tame.  I want to see more movie.  I really enjoy watching movies.  Maybe I should find a job dealing with film.  Anything good come out next weekend?  Probably not.  This weekend didn't take much out of me so I'm good to go something this week.  Someone call me if you want to go out and do something.   Let's twist again, like we did last summer.

      Well I ended up eating dog on Friday night.  I have to say this was an experience.  I also have to say that it tasted pretty darn good.  I know this is a little scary but it's true.  It was Fenton, Caleb, Asma, Sarah and myself who indulged ourselves in man's best friend.  After this Asma, Caleb and I made our way downtown and met Gabe and Lois at Bellagio.  I think Bellagio has become my "Commune."  We had a good time and played some drinking games and chit-chatted.  At some point people broke off and went there own ways but Becky, Gina and I went to Fe.  Everyone met up here later.  Stuff kinda fizzled out and I went with Caroline and Caleb to get some food.  I made it home before it go too late and fairly sober.   Saturday I saw a Korean movie with Hey-Sook.  Man I have to say that Korean movies for the most part suck.  This isn't my opinion I truly believe this as a fact.  I really haven't seen any movie that is above average.  I hear there are some good ones I guess I just haven't had the chance to see them.  This movie was about a boys school in 1978 and had virtually no plot.  It was basically about who was the biggest badass and then there was a girl mixed into the story at some point.  I might have to revise my decree of greatest restaurant in Daegu from Myoungdong Kalgook soo to WABA.  Yes this is where I ate last night and it was a little bit of heaven.  When then hit up Bellagio for some cocktails.  Here I ran into the whole crew.  I'm sorry I didn't join but Hey-Sook still suffers from the  "I'm Korean and uncomfortable around foreigners" syndrome.  It was fun none the less and I saw most everyone at GR later.  She got tired and I dumped her in a cab and was going to go to BB but they wanted 10k to get in at 4 in the morning.  Forget that.  Asma and I ended up have a Chocolate shake at She's I have a question.  Do annoying people know that they are annoying?  The answer has to be no, right?  I mean if they knew they were annoying they would try to act differently I would think.  But yet they don't.  On the other hand it seems so obvious how could they not know?  And lastly why are there some many of them here?  For as many cool people as there are here there are some real boobs.  A good example was this fool of a kiwi looking for an atm last night who just turned out to be a real dumbass.

      So looks like boys night might be another night.  I think tonight will be dog soup night.  I hope it's good.  I'm a little worried that it's going to suck some ass.  I guess we'll find out.  After eating the dog there should be some craziness happening.  Time is ticking for several people so I think it's time to make the most of the time left.  I got some pretty good sleep last night so I think I'm good to go, depending on how dinner treats me.   Looking at these maps makes me realize how big the world really is.  There is a lot of green on my maps.  I'm thinking I'll knock 2 maybe 3 more countries.  Still I don't think that's going to make much of a difference on my map.   Why is it still so cold?  When will it get warm again?  I need some spring soon.   Certian things in Korea are really starting to get to me.  Namely the fact that everything looks the same.  For example check out all the apartment buildings.  While there might some small differences for the most part the have the same shape and colors.  To take it a step further all the apartments look the same.  All the walls have a very bland color and they all have the same floor.  I miss carpet.  Koreans don't decorate their apartments very much or very well either.  The streets pretty much all look the same too.  Everything is the same style you know.  Neon lights and the same assortment of restaurants, bars, stationary shops and markets.  You either live in a tall ass apartment building or you live in one of these little crappy houses that I live it.  I wish there was a little more diversity.   Enough is enough.  No fucking spell check.

I found them on her sight first.  It tells me that I've been to 9% of the countries in the world.  It isn't much but when you think about it I'm almost been to 1 in 10.  So at this stage in life I think that's respectable.  The states on the other hand, man I need to do some traveling around there.  As you can see I've been all around the South but ventures out of there have been few and far between.  I've only been to 37% of the states.  This is a little disappointing.  Before I leave and go home for good I hope to tack on a few more countries in Asia.   Oh man I love some Bon Jovi.  This is what I'm rocking out to in the PC room as I'm just writing away.  I've had a craving for chocolate today.  I've consumed two bags of Hershey's kisses today.  These aren't the big bags we are used to back West, they are little snack bags.  Ever since I've gotten back from China I've had a hard time getting my diet back in order.  I keep eating poorly.   In a random act of kindness the owner of my gym gave me a pair of Head tennis shoes the other day.  They are pretty nice except for the fact they are pretty ugly.  I might dare to wear them out sometime.  They kind of remind me of bowling shoes.   Last night was open mic night at TC.  I came downtown and then met Asma there.  We were joined by Eilleen's birthday crew a little later.  I thought Fenton was going to sing b/c he really wanted to hit TC but turns out not.  I saw some dudes up there jamming but it just wasn't that impressing.  I split out and then met Hey-Sook.  We went to Bellagio and grabbed some cocktails.  We were later joined by Asma and Fenton.  We had a pitcher of beer which they forgot to charge us for.  But being the honest foreigners that we are we realized this and went back to pay.  We suspect one or more persons had to commit honorable suicide over that.  We then hit up Exodus for a drink.  This seems to be a new hot spot.  It is actually a pretty cool hang out.  I only wish they have beer on tap.  I ate a hell of a lot of little dried fish.  I had a pork cutlet of dinner but it just wasn't filling.  There are plans to consume dog soup tomorrow for those who are interested.  I think this ranks under the title of experiments.  I figure if it's terrible then we'll just blow the joint and get some food somewhere else.  It would be a shame to have been in Korea this long and not at least give it a try.  I'll keep the names of  those I'm eating with anonymous in case they don't want others to know.   Last night there was also some pretty awesome snow.  It was really coming down at one point.  It didn't really amount to much and didn't stick so well but it was snow none the less.  As much as I enjoy the snow I'll be glad when it warms up a bit.   My dirty little porno student finally got back in the grove today.  He told me he went to church camp and scored with a chick.  He also kept talking about money shots.  He went on and on about how women want it on their face they think it's delicious.  I'm just a little worried about this kid.  He also taught me the Korean word for masturbating but I forgot it.  Whenever I ask them what do they want to do he always tells me "sex play."  Great idea except for the fact that there are only guys in the class.  Then he got smart and said that we could steal some girls from the other classes.

      Seems I have some support on the fact that English through pictures is the worst book ever.  And unfortunately I've taught both of the lessons Becky and Michelle talked about.  My favorite part of the lesson I taught is when they asked what colors do you see in the picture.  You think this would be a good question until you realize the picture is in BLACK and WHITE!  I think it will never end for me, the frustration that is.  Someone made a good point and told me that I was in a different place than I was last year.  This is very true.  Last year I was looking to just make some money, have a good time and goof off.  Now I feel the need to do something worthwhile.  I think this is good because it means I won't be here in Korea forever.   Anyone see the Super Bowl?  It was a pretty good game.  I wish I would have watched the halftime show  though.  I was pulling for the Jags but the Patriots were too much.   I saw Runaway Jury yesterday and I have to say that is a pretty good movie.  Much better than I expected.   Ok this keyboard keeps randomly switching to Korean while I'm typing and it's a getting a little annoying.  You know those vendors on the streets that sell the fish bread with the red beans in them?  As of late I've really taking a liking to these.  I'm not really sure why though.  They don't taste all that great but yet I crave them.  Beats me.  Good thing they're cheap.   I think someone is getting a little too friendly with me in the gym.  This time it comes in the form of a 16 year old boy.  This dude skipped his academy to come to the gym and see me yesterday.  Too bad for him I never showed.  Today he hung out at the gym for about 4 hours.  Two of those hours I was there.  Sometimes I just don't understand Koreans.  Doesn't the think it would be a little strange to have a foreigner following him around?  He tried to get me to correct an English speech for one of his friends but I didn't.  I hate that shit.  It is annoying enough if you asked me to correct your speech but you fucking friends speech.  Give me a break.   Looks like I'll end up dowtown tonight at some point.  It is open mic at The Commune.  I hate that place but I'm sure I'll end up there for a bit at least.  Since I've been hanging out with Hey-Sook I've started really taking a liking to soju.  The stuff really isn't that bad and it's cheap.  It also goes well with a fair deal of Korean foods.  Enough for now.

      The reading of post weekend blogs is quite a treat b/c everyone updates and usually has some cool stuff to say.  First and Foremost I'm about to go nuts if I stay around LIKE any longer.  I'm glad Becky and understand.  This week they see it fit to work my roommate much less than me.  By much less I mean to the tune of 2 hours and 15 minutes.  I know this doesn't sound like much but this is three classes and I want to get off of work early or go in late.  Now here is where I really get mad.  After I bring this up to my manager he can't do anything.  He first hits me with every excuse in the book which I shoot down as soon as he has them and then he can't explain to my why it's me getting dicked over.  Anyway I'm just to the point of not caring.  Worst yet I'm only asking for what is fair so why is it such a big deal.  My manager is completely inept.  I'm not sure he, or any other managers at LIKE for that matter, do anything.  Every little decision must be run by Mr. or Mrs. Kim.  Then of course when you talk to them they have no clue what the hell is going on.  Ugh, these people have no clue.  There is a slight chance they could stumble upon this page but at this point it doesn't matter.  They need to know there are serious problems with their business and this is why so many kids are leaving.  But I guess kids leaving isn't that bad b/c that means less work for me, in theory at least.   On a separate rant the material we use is total and utter crap.  This has been bothering me for a while but it all came to head when I had to teach English through pictures at Sigi last week.  Ok this has to be the worst EVER!  Allow me to explain.  The idea is that there is a picture, a story to go with it, and then question and discussion about it.  Well sounds like a good idea.  I would love to know who wrote the stories for these pictures b/c they make no sense.  I think it was meant as a joke but somehow the Kim's didn't catch it and it got published.  The picture I had to teach was one of a woman standing in front of a river waving.  The story said that she claimed to be the fairy of the river and that she was going to jump into the river do a magic trick and then swim away.  What the fuck?  Better yet there is a little girl who is looking at the women in picture and the story later explain that the girl thought the women was weird and crazy.  For the love of God I can't believe I have to teach kids this shit.  I would have taken these kids on a field trip but Asma had done it the previous class.  Ok I need to stop talking about LIKE before I break something.  How was I ever happy with this company?  Really I wonder. Well the weekend was cool.  I ended up out really late and at GR on Friday night.  I also dipped into FE again and this time it was pretty happening.  Last time I was there they didn't have half the stuff on the menu.  Saturday was a good night too.  I ended up meeting Hey-Sook first.  We went shopping for a bit.  I had a hat that was gift from my b-day that need to be exchanged at EXR so we went there to see what there was to see.  As it turns out there wasn't much to see.  Really the clothes there were so ugly and expensive it wasn't funny.  I can deal with ugly clothes, or expensive clothes, but when you have to pay a lot of money for clothes that look bad, that just ain't good.  Well I finally found one shirt that wasn't too bad and made do with it.  Instead of a bag they gave me a box to carry it around in.  This made for a great conversation piece as many people asked about it.  I'm not sure who but someone suggest I just stuff the shirt in my bag.  Really I should have done this but I just couldn't bother at the time.  Korea in general has problems with clothes.  I think I should call E and suggest having a fashion emergency series in Korea.  I think it might do some good.  We ended up eating raw fish at this really popular restaurant.  It  wasn't too bad.  She likes to drink soju so I enjoy drinking with her.  We then migrated to TC to say hello to the crew.  It was Eilleen's and Peter's birthdays so that made for fun.  There was an icecream cake provided by Asma I think and I partook a little in that.  I love icecream cakes.  After that she and I ended up in Bellagio.  We were joined shortly after by Caleb and Meabh.  This was good fun.  We drank and then they headed off to GR I think.  I never ended up catching up, but I did try, more on that later.  After Bellagio, damnit I can't remember.  I wasn't that plastered but I just can't figure it out right now.  I'll think of it later.  At some point she was tired and went home.  I think tried to call some people and see what was going on but everyone had called it a night early.  So I think went home.  Hate carrying my bag around with me downtown.  I think I'm going to stop doing that from now on.   Sunday was tame.  I met up with Hey-sook and we saw Paycheck.  The movie wasn't really that good but the plot was interesting and it had a couple of cool ideas in it.  We ate at the greatest restaurant in all of Korea and then got coffee.  I shared this sight with her.  I'm not sure if this was a good idea or not, but I guess time will tell.  I'd like to think I have nothing to hide.   I think the plan is for guys night this Friday.  I'll be calling people to motivate them this week.  I was a little disappointed last time I tried to organize it as it almost fell flat but I'll give it another shot.  It is good to just hang out with the boys and shoot the shit and have fun.  I'm hoping for a turn out of 5 or 6.   I'm hungry.  I had a big ass lunch.  I was cooking food after having gone to the store.  But while waiting I just had to have a bowl of Oreo cereal.  Then one bowl turned into two.  This along with the tuna rice I ate made me very full.  I wish there was more variety of food in Korea.   I'm just in a mood to complain.  My house is a dump.  We have a leak in one of the walls.  What else do I need to get out?  Really I think blogging helps to relieve frustration.  Ok time to track down some food.   Well not yet.  There is a little more I'd like to write about.  I love getting e-mails from people I haven't talked to in forever completely out of the blue.  This happend twice over today.  First was my cousin Jenny who live in California.  She has always been really cool but we haven't been close do to difference in age and location.  Anyway it was really thoughtful of her to e-mail me and makes me wonder why I hadn't done so a long time ago.  Next my friend Trey shot me a line.  I've known this guy forever and it turns out he'll be asia in late March and might make it over to Korea.  I think he's going to marry a Japanese chick so he'll be going to Japan to meet the rents I think.  I haven't seen him in longer than I can remember but somehow we managed to keep in touch.  God bless e-mail.

      Ok I'm just chilling tonight and doing nothing.  I'll go home watch tv, write a little and then sleep a lot.  At least that is the plan.  For some reason my classes seemed to take forever today.  Not in a bad way mind you but it just seemed time would not move.  I think this is b/c I'm desperately trying to make it to Sunday so Tim and I can get the hell out of here and get to Saipan.   A good friend from back home finally got his computer fixed and I recieved an e-mail from him today.  It is so good to catch up with people you haven't talked to in forever.  He also happens to be co-owner of the best comic book store in all of Warner Robins GA.   If there is one thing I do miss from the states it has to be my friends.  There are particulars like a Chick-fila chicken sandwich, but for the most part I just miss the people.   I think I'll find another quiz to take, I haven't done one of those in a while.

      I think Koreans can listen to the same songs over and over again and never get tired of them.  I base this on the fact that downtown they have these cd and tapes vendors who just blast out one song the entire day and never change.  This goes on for weeks.  I'd go insane if I had to put up with that crap. I'm not going to bother elaborating on any of my previous blogs.  I just can't be bothered.  I know there is more I'd like to put in but really it doesn't matter.  I have some friends from Seoul coming in town on Thursday.  I need some people to hang out with me and entertain them.  They are all girls, 1 American and 3 French.  Let me know if you're free.  The strangest thing happened today.  I chatted with an ex-girl friend of mine that I thought hated me.  We haven't spoken in almost 2 years.  Needless to say a lot of things have changed.  She sent me an e-mail out of the blue and I looked her up on AIM.  It was really good to find out that she doesn't hate me, or at least she'll talk to me.  I would write more but it's a pretty personal subject.   I went to a new burger place by Seattle's best.  I have to say it's pretty darn good.  I splurged and went total American style with a burger, fries and a coke.  Little pricy but really good.  Free refills on coke rule.  I've been slacking off at the gym and I'm so pissed at myself.  Why have I been so damn busy lately?  Where does my time go?  Apparently since this latest Korean war epic has been doing so well they're going to make another war movie but this time it is going to portray the Americans as the bad guys some how.  I'm sure of the details but Steve was telling me about it.  I hope they enjoy it b/c what they don't realize is that Americans could care less.  I think most Americans don't even know exactly where Korea is.  It just frustrates me the way they are so ungreatful towards Americans here.  I know GI's are idiots and I don't expect them to bend down and kiss our royal white asses but man you think they'd at least appreciate the fact that we are keeping their militant, communist neighbor to the North at bay.  But alas no.  There was a poll taken in the newspaper a while back and went something to the effect of, more younger Koreans thought the U.S. was a bigger threat to South Korea than North Korea.  Man what are they smoking?  Ugh, I guess I just need to vent.  Ok I have to meet Gyeh-son.  Fuck spell check.

      Turns out free beer was enough to get most of us out last night.  By most of us I mean Fenton, Caleb and myself.  Miller time was totally packed.  I've never seen it like that before.  The beer was a little funny and possibly watered down but good none the less.  I think a good time was had by all.  We then went to Exodus so Fenton could say hello to his better half.  Here we were harrassed by and equally drunk bartender who was really hot.  In theory I met her before at AU but that's all a little blurry.  For Caleb and I was onto AU.  This place is the coolest ever.  Why?  Because they have a monkey.  Yes a real live monkey.  It is a one year old African monkey that the bartender carries around with her and lets the customers play with him.  Asma you're really missing out.  On Saturday he ate part of Andreas cake.  So here we made broken English conversation with one of the bartenders.  She confessed to being a playgirl.  Caleb also gave them their first opportunity to make a kamakazi.

      Well I have a little time.  Looks like free beer might not be enough to get us to go out tonight.  I think this is good.  I'm really tired.  I'm just unmotivated to do a lot of things.  I'm not messaging people back and I'm just generally feeling a little flat.  I've partied way too much lately and I need to save my self for the upcoming vacation.  Speaking of which Tim and I went downtown today and got everything squared away.  There really has been just too much happening lately.  I can't keep the nights straight anymore.  On Friday I was out with Fenton, Tim and Min-ah.  We started at Miller Time and then went to Bellagio.  There was plenty of finger game action and titanic.  In this night I made the single best and the single worst pours of my life in the game we call titanic.  There was movie talk going on and some bets were made between Tim and I.  Turns out he was right on one and I was right on one so we split.  We had to run to PC room to go settle it.  At some point I ended up at Titanic and I might or might not have made it to BB.  I'm really too tired to know.  But I made it home safely and that's all that matters.   Saturday I really should have gone home earlier but I gave into temptation and stayed out.  It started at Outback for Andrea's B-day.  Lately the food there seems to be really good.  We then went to AU.  This is now the coolest place to drink in Daegu.  I have to say one thing that annoys me are people who are  boring and have little to no personality.  This is even more annoying if they are hot.  Anyway we moved to TC which really wasn't that bad.  Here we found Fenton who said he was going to stay in  but really lied.  I made it home late and resolved to not go to work.  There are more details to be told but I think I'll do that another time.  No spell check.

      Why am I awake?  How am I awake?  Well the answer to the first question is to send an e-mail to my boss explaining why I totally fucking blew off work this morning.  I think I'm getting to the point of just not caring.  I was supposed to work this Sunday morning to make up for the day I'm taking to go to Saipan.  But nobody ever told me when to show up so I didn't show up.  I went home unplugged the phone and slept like a log.  The hell if I'm going to show up only to find out they don't need me.  The can get their asses organized.  Today was great.  Best Sunday I've had in longer then I can remember.  I hung out with Hey-sook all day.  It is cool we can still be friends and kick it.  All of this was topped off by a victory in Risk tonight.  I'll figure out what happened on Fri. and Sat. some other time.  If I can move tomorrow there is free beer at Miller Time.  I think this is a good thing.   I'm going to bed.

      Looks like I'm getting back into the swing of blogging.  I'm meeting Ju-mi for sam gyup sal tonight so I'll take a minute to just yap away.  This is the third Wednesday in a row we've eaten the tasty pork food together.  I'm really tired but I didn't do anything today.  I think this might be why.  I need a good kick in the ass.  My new favorite thing about Korea is triangle kim-bap.  I know this stuff has been around forever but I'm just now discovering how tasty it really is.  I think I'm in love with the stuff.  I have to work this Sunday in order to get my time off next week to go to Saipan.  I guess I won't be able to giver like crazy on Saturday but on Friday I'll go all out.  Last time I stayed up all night and just went to work.  Really bad idea.  I was paid for that for a long time.  I got to work at the new man-ch'on LIKE today.  Whatever, it's all the same crap.  Hee-duk looks like he's been putting on the some weight.  I worked with Denise, Eddie and Chantel (sp?).  Denise seemed really nice and cool.  Eddie and I never spoke and Chantel, well I just didn't get a good vibe from her.  They have class there until 9:40.  That is some messed up stuff.  I complained about getting of at 8:30.  It is just a matter of time until that school flops too.   I feel restless, like I want to do something but I don't know exactly what.  Going to Saipan will be a good change I think.  Working Saturdays sucks.  I'd really like a two day weekend.  I don't think my place really feels like home either.  It's just a place to sleep.  I want some where warm and cozy.  Ok I can't think of anything else worthwhile to say.  I'll just go find another quiz.     You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      So I got the time off to go to Saipan, this is good news.  Looks like it will be Tim and I going.  There is an outside chance Jin-ah will tag along but I'm not so certain.  Anyone else is more then welcome to come if you have the time off.  I just looked at a bunch of pictures from Caleb's trip as well as assorted places online and I have to say I'm looking forward to a it a little bit.  I'm feeling pretty darn good today.  I had a great night's sleep last night and a decent workout at the gym.  We'll see how work goes today.  Tonight I think I'll take it easy and just do some laundry.  Life has gotten really good over here the last few months.  I'm giving thought to meeting up in India with Asma and touring around.  If I do I'll hang out here for about another month or so.  I think this is possible given that I think I'm in good graces with Mr. and Mrs. Kim.  I might see if I can switch schools.  I like my school my roommate and kids but the part of town could be better.   Being the movie lover that I am I just couldn't resist.    Lion King!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I'm giving serious thought to shaving my head, or at least cutting my hair really short.

      My life has slowed down for the night so I'll use this time wisely to blog.  This weekend was the best of times and the worst of times.  But I'll only write about the best of them.  Saturday was fun/interesting.  I started out with Fenton at AU.  This place is simply badass.  But I have to say I'm not sure it's the place I want to start at on a Saturday.  It is swanky and laid back.  But usually I'm the mood for somewhere a little more crowded and happening.  Either way it was fun.  People start showing up and we started drinking more.  The finger game as always was my undoing.  I was doing great for a while but then everything just fell apart.  My girlfriend can drink beer faster then me, how pathetic is that?  Fenton never seems to let me forget this.  But I can drink a hell of a lot more.  From AU we stopped in at Bellagio.  Not much memorable happened there, or maybe I just don't remember, I'm not sure which.  At some point Gumi James, Jeff, Lee and I were going to GR but something went horribly wrong at only Jeff and I made it there.  He then ended up upstairs while I danced myself almost to sobriety.  Gumi James bumped into some girl on the street who he ran off with, no surprise there really.  But Lee on the other hand, well this was a little fishy.  So I was the first to pay and go in.  The entrance is up top now so you pay and go down all the stairs.  So I paid and went on my way.  I saw Jeff and Lee pay and assumed they'd be along shortly.  Well Jeff made it but Lee never did.  I thought maybe he got confused so I went to look for him upstairs but still nothing.  Later that night we found out the bouncers wouldn't' let him in b/c they thought his camera was a bomb.  Only in Korea.  GR was a lot of fun.  Even though there weren't any other people from the friend group there I ended up knowing most of the foreigners there.  Jeff and I finally bounced around 3:30 or four.  Oh yeah Gumi did finally make it there.  It was then off to BB.  This place was packed an happening like I've never ever seen.  For some reason there seemed to be a ton of beautiful girls out.  At some point Gumi James asked me where a DVD bang was.  We can only guess what happened after that.  I ended up meeting a girl named Min-ah who was pretty cool.  All in all not a bad night.  I was less drunk then I thought I'd be.  After AU I was a little worried but when I got home I was almost completely sober.   I totally got caught sleeping in class today.  Worse yet I just couldn't less.  There were three kids and they've finished the book so we did the review and after they were finished they wanted to play hangman.  So whatever I let them play.  Being a little pooped I sat down and dozed off.  Sure enough the manager happened to walk by and check on me.  But he just woke me up and that was it and didn't say anything else.  I still don't think he likes me.  I also went to the travel agent today and I'm going to try and go to Saipan this upcoming break.  I'm excited, I think it'll be fun.  It is always good to get a little break from Korea.   I saw Hidalgo last night.  Pretty good movie.  Not great but fun.  Makes me want to ride horses and shit like that.  I feel I should be insightful on my blog, but at this point it's just beyond me.  I'm looking forward to a peaceful nights sleep tonight.  I planned on washing my clothes but wouldn't you know it my roomy beat me to it and there is only one drying rack which means my ass has to wait.   Oh I forgot to mention my streak of not so great Korean haircuts was continued this week.  I went with Gyeh-son to get my hair cut on Wed.  This time my hair doesn't look much different.  I guess if I have to choose between the two this is better then having it butchered.  I also got possibly the worst highlights ever.  I asked about them but didn't ask for them.  I just wanted to know if they were available and how much they were.  Well someone misunderstood something and before I knew it crazy shit was happening so I just sucked it up and took it.  Ok I'm going to find some kind of online quiz to take. Putting your appointed path ahead of any inner conflicts, you make your own rules for the benefit of all.  If my life or death I can protect you, I will.  p> urlLink

      Admitidly my blogging habbits have started to slip.  Seems I'm just so busy now days and when I'm in a PC I just want to read other people's blogs and not bother with typing shit into mine.  But this will change.  Last night was fun.  Tim, Troy, Peter, Fionna and I all went to a board game cafe and bust out the best game of risk I've ever played.  All told it took about 3 and a half hours but we saw it through to the very end.  It literally came down to the last army, Tim vs. yours truely.  And on the last roll all I had to do was roll a two or better, and I couldn't.  I had a 5 in 6 chance of winning and I managed to lose, unbelievable.  Afterwards we went to the old GR and had few beers.  I had no clue I'd be out so late.  Our game finished around 3:30.  The place usually closes at 2 but they just let us keep playing and that we did.   Thursday was another great and exciting LIKE meeting.  To let you know just how exciting it was Ursula spoke.  Wow this was the longest 20 minutes in the history of time.  These meetings are a complete waist of time and there are less and less people every time.  The only good thing about the meeting was that Tim and I have found out how to make it big back in the U.S.  The is brothel boats.  Since prostitution is illegal you round up some hoes stick them on a boat and then get some clients.  Then you sail out into international waters and well, you can figure out the rest.  This isn't an original idea I confess.  Steven my roommate told me that this was the common practice in NZ before brothels were legalized.   I don't like my manager very much, I think he is a flake and I don't think he likes me.  He is a nice guy but completely incompetent.  I think I've started to take a page from Asma's book in the fact that nice is good but just doesn't fucking cut it.  There are many things in Korea that are starting to grind on my nerves.  But it's intangables that I can't exactly explain.  In general I really wonder if Koreans have a clue as to what is going on in the world.  I don't mean to say they don't read the newspaper but it just seems that the are so clueless about anything but  Korea.  I think they need to get out more.  Ok I've got to go meet Fenton at AU now.  I'll be more regular on the blog.  Oh Koreans are also the worst synchronized dancers ever.  I know b/c I saw them doing this infront of X-milano.  I acknowledge tons of spelling errors but I'm not going to bother with spell check.

      Finally a little time to blog.  My neck hurts like hell for no reason.  I guess it is how I slept on it last night or something.  I look forward to going to sleep just so I can wake up pain free.  My Saturday night started well and slowly went downhill.  An apology to Fenton, Caleb and Sarah, who I told I would find but never did.  I had dinner with Gyeh-son and we had to talk about "issues" and afterwards I just went home.  I thought I would come back downtown later but never made it.  Stuff is all cool now but my night was a dud.  On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it a suck.  Anyway enough about that crap.   Friday night was a different story and a good one at that.  I finally got to eat with Fenton and Sarah after waiting almost an hour.  But it's cool.  We ate at Myondong-Kal gook soo.  So good.  We then went to Miller Time and had some dark beer. I really kind of like MT.  It is just a big room with a lot of beer but I'm down with that.  Caleb joined up with us and we all went to Bellagio.  Here we played the finger game and I was made fun of b/c I can't drink beer quickly.  Really I don't know what is wrong with me but I'm totally unable to down a beer.  I know I should be able to but I just can't get the hang of it.  I we left B and I had to walk Gyehs-son to a cab and then we dipped into the TC for a beer.   Here I chatted up with the guy from Maebh's b-day who got really fucking trashed.  Tim also showed up and hung out.  The drunk guy's name is William.  He has a really annoying laugh, sounds like a girl.  So this is where my night go interesting.  We decided to roll to BB.  So at this point it was me, Tim, William, Caleb might have been there, not sure, he showed up at some point anyway.  So Oh-ni, a girl I used to date showed up.  Things seemed to be cool with us until a couple weeks back she snubbed me at GR.  But no biggie, I was with someone else anyway.  So this week we played the game of "you're on that side and I'm on this side" of the bar.  I got sick of the game and planned a strategic retreat.  We decided to go grab some grubb.  But on the way out we ran into Fenton, Caleb and Sarah.  Oh yeah so Caleb wasn't there at first.  So Sarah want to dance and I was like "ok let's dance."  So instead of her winning I came back with a girl and had a blast dancing.  Not soon after, she left.  Oh I have to say it felt a little good.  I finally made it home around 6 or so.   I think I'll go downtown tomorrow to the travel agent and see what deals are cooking.  This isn't the best of blog b/c I've been talking on MSN but it is better than none at all.  I'm out.

      Have I really not updated since Sunday?  Where has the time gone?  I feel like I have no free time.  I seem to be seeing a lot of movies lately.  I saw The Hunted last night and it was pretty bad.  But in Korea that really doesn't matter.  It entertained me and that's about all I ask for.  I've been seeing a lot of Gyeh-son lately.  I think  that's where my time has gone.  I'm surprised she isn't sick of me.  Ok I don't have much time to blog b/c I have work coming up.  Nothing too eventful has happened this week.  I think this weekend should be pretty giver, at least I'm hoping so.  Oh I found a board game cafe where we can drink.  This either has disaster or fun written all over it.

      I feel I'm still playing catch up on this blog.  I'm even going to go into whatever else happened last week.  I did end up watching the Academy awards and LOTR did really well.  In fact they just completely mopped up.  Also of note, on Monday night I was out with a crew of people.  Our numbers dwindled until is was Tim, Caleb and myself.  Tim in true giver fashion went and rounded up some more people from TC and brought them to The Pulse.  They turned out to all be LIKE teachers.  Peter, Carrie and a new girl named Kimmy.  This was a lot of fun.  Eventually the girls left and we started talking about all kinds of crazy nerdy things which really made my night.   This weekend has been pretty good.  Friday I was out with Gyeh-son.  We had a few drinks and watched a movie in a DVD room and then hit up Bellagio for some drinks.  We saw some strange movie called "what if you were me" or something to that effect.  It was a collection of six short films.  I would say they were along the lines of too much conecpt not enough content.  Either way, it was interesting but that was about all.  Thanks go out to Asma.  The DVD room card you gave me let me get a free movie this time around, A-Ssaa.  Bellagio was same as usual.  While there I got a phone call from my buddy Brad.  Turns out this was his last night in Korea.  So I sent Gyeh-son home and then tracked him down.  I finally found him at Phunkaholic hammered out of his mind.  While there I started talking to the owner of the bar, this dude named Pierre Dion.  So I met this guy last year, and when I say last year I mean Nov. 02, up in Seoul.  And the only reason I remember him is that he was from Daegu also.  He actually gave me his business card I think.  Anyway so we started chatting and he remembered me too so he hooked me up with a free drink.  We got out of there and headed to get some food.  We at BBQ at the all night BBQ place and then said farewell.  He was a cool guy, I wish I could have hung out more with him.  Ok I'm going to look for another quiz.

      Ok I finally went out and found my own quiz.  It's pretty lame but I was tired of taking them from everyone elses site.  So here you go.   your asshole.    urlLink   What swear word are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Today I went downtown and had a nice lunch with Ji-un.  Nice girl.  I've known her for a fairly long time.  She is really cool and good  company.  Keeping with our tradition we ate at Pizza Hut.  Good stuff.  I only have five classes today so that's awesome.   Saturday night was just plain nuts.  First it started downtown where I ate dinner with Ju-mi.  I've known her a long time too and lately I've been seeing a lot of her.  I wonder why, I'm not sure really.  Anyway we had Chinese and then shopped.  She wasn't down with coming to a party with all foreigners so I bid her fairwell and headed to Meabh's house.  Meabh's B-day was a lot of fun.  Their place is really nice.  I'd bought her something when I was shopping with Ju-mi but I managed to forget it in X-Milano.  So, to make up for it I picked her up a bottle of wine on the way to the party.  The party was fun and there was lots of drinking and nerdy talk to follow.  Fenton's childhood friend Lee turned out to be really cool.  Once done here we went downtown and hit TC for a just a bit.  Just long enough to down a shot of Jager and vodka.  Really really really bad idea.  Now this is where it gets interesting.  So Gumi James, Caleb and I decide to go to GR.  Well on the way there Caleb gets the bright idea to attack a penis balloon.  Seems harmless enough but looks can be decieveing.  Apparently this penis balloon had enough and decided to hit him back.  This being said he fell down and cut his chin rather well.  At first I didn't think it was a big deal and I told him to suck it up.  But Gumi James quickly pointed out that it was a little more then a scrape and that we should probably go to the hospital.  And that we did.  So we get to the hospital.  Nobody spoke English well, but they spoke enough English and I spoke enough Korean.  We got the paper work squared away and I paid, or so I thought I did.  It came to 17,000 K.  We got taken upstairs and Caleb go stiched up and we were going to be on our way until they decided he needed a shot in the ass.  This is where stuff just got crazy.  In his drunken fury Caleb refused to take the shot in the ass.  I can kind of understand that.  So the nurse asked about the arm.  But Caleb wasn't down with that either.  After argueing for what seemed like an eternity I told the nurse it wasn't going to happen.  Thinking that we were all done we split out and headed back downtown to the "new couple party" at AU.  Giver to Caleb who went out drinking after having 4 stiches put in him.  I didn't have much left in me andI didn't stay long.  Turns out the mixing off alcohols made me pay the price the next day.   Ok I found another quiz and this one is a little cooler.  I'm a little pressed for time as I have to go to work now but I might come back and update some of the details of Saturday, or maybe not.

      Yes I stole another lame quiz from Mieka's site.  I think this quiz is totally wack as I do confess to being a geek of geeks.  This all came pooring out on Monday night.  But that is for another time.    You are   11%   geek     OK, so maybe you ain't a geek. You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you. Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test. Regardless, you're probably a pretty nifty, well-rounded person who gets along fine with people and can chat with just about anyone without fear of looking stupid or foolish or overly concerned with minutiae. God, I hate you.      urlLink Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com

      Long time no blog, and I don't even know where to begin.  I'm too tired to really hash through it all now.  I'd advise reading Caleb's blog as he has done a pretty darn good job at summing the craziness up.  My vacation really wasn't anything special.  I wish I'd gone somewhere or done something but I really didn't have anywhere to go or anyone to go with.  Tonight I hung out with Gyeh-son by here school.  We grabbed some food and then hit a DVD room.  We watched League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  I'd heard it wasn't so good but man I have to say I thought it wasn't bad at all.  In fact I'd have to say it was pretty good.  Being a comic fan I'm a big fan of the whole super hero angel.  After putting her in a cab the lights of Dunkin Donuts caught my eyes and I just had to have two of them.  And that I did.  Caleb and Tim downed a couple on Monday night and I guess I'd been wanting some since then.  LIKE is beginning to get back on my nerves.  They are trying to start new classes again.  The problem is that they can only start classes with little kids.  Anyone with any kind of English speaking ability stays the hell away from the school.  This means more lessons of kids one lesson one.  Shoot me now.   I'll summarize Friday and be done for tonight.  Friday was pretty tame compared to what I'm used to.  I met up with Gyeh-son and we watched 2 Fast 2 Furious.  Terrible movie but fun none the less.  We then played some board games, which I managed to win.  This is surprizing b/c she is a pretty darn good.  We then had dessert and she headed home.  I tried to find someone to giver with but nobody was around and to be honest I was pretty tired.  I went home and got a decent nights sleep.   Ok I'm wrecked.  I'm going home.  It was a blast to read everyone's blogs seeing as how I haven't made it to a PC bang in days.  Apologies go out to Mieka.  Apparently there are some unbecoming posts concerning you on my tag board.  As soon as I'm in a pc room where I can see the board and access the site that it works off of I'll take care of it.  Currently I'm not.  Sleep sleep sleep.

      Nothing like a day off.  I'm currently in the PC room Asma always used to go to and I can see why it is only 600won an hour.  The computers here are pretty crappy by Korean standards but what is annoying me the most is that the spacebar isn't working properly.  This is a real pain in the ass.  But I think I'll manage.   So it's great to have a day off and just be able to hang out and chill.  I hit the travel agent but he wasn't in again.  Damnit.  Oh well I'll got tomorrow.  I had a great workout at my new gym.  Then I walked over to the zoo, if you can really call it that.  More like a collection of a few animals.  They did have some tigers and elephants so I guess that makes it count.  It was a good walk so I've gotten more than my fair share of exercise today.  The hightlights of the zoo included someone wanting me to be in a picture with there baby.  This was a little strange but whatever.  They also had a three legged dog, poor guy.   I then chilled in SB and hung out.  I really love having my afternoons free.  I didn't make it to homeplus but I might do that yet depending on when it closes.   Last night was a lot of fun.  But we didn't eat any sam gyup sal.  I guess it will make it all the better on Saturday night.  I can't decided what to do with my hair.  I'm getting pretty shaggy but I don't know if I should embrace it or I should kill it and get it cut.  I kind of like it but it's a little difficult to style in the event I want to make myself all pretty for a night on the town.  I've found a killer place to eat chicken late at night.  So next time we're all going nuts downtown and need some food we'll hit this place.   Tim even though you don't read this page thanks of the circus peanuts, they're really good.   I think I've giving up on spell check.

      Little time to blog here before work.  So I finally got money sent home.  This was a huge ordeal with tons and tons of obsitcles but apparently it's finally over with.  I'm still waiting for something to go wrong.  I found what appears to be a good deal on tickets to Thailand so that might be where Gumi James and I are going to go.  I ended up having to work on yesterday but no big deal.  Weather was crappy anyway.  So tomorrow I need to hit the travel agent and then I'll go to the zoo and go shopping.  I'd like to buy the lonely planet travel books they have at Kyobo but they are so damn expensive.  I've debated on going to Myanmar (Burma) but I've ruled that would be pretty much crazy.  I should have tomorrow off.  I think I won't pick up my phone so they can't find me in the event they need someone to work.   I might hang out with Hey-sook tonight and hit up WABA.  I think this place might be a little bit of heaven on earth.  She has some super tough test today so afterwards I told her I'd take her out to eat.  Incidently WABA is her favorite place too.  Match made in heaven huh?   Why aren't the rest of you other bloggers updating?  You guys are really dragging ass.  I need more stuff to read.  0 spell check.

      Where to start?  Living downtown and having plenty of free time is really cool.  Today I went by and finalized my paper work with Scott.  There was a little scare concerning my getting a plane flight home but that turned out to be a miscommunication and so all is settled.  Everything is looking good for the SE Asia vacation/adventure this summer.  Kevin gave me the downlow on what to do an not do and Caleb has said I can borrow his bag so this pretty much means I'm good to go.  Gumi James and I will be going somewhere, I'm not exactly sure where, at the end of May.  Then I'll start off on my own until I die or run out of money.  Kyobo finally got a great restock of lonely planet books and they have Vietnam and Cambodia so I'll go sit in the bookstore and read some of those tomorrow.  I have tomorrow off and there are plenty of things to do.  I need to go to the bank and send money home, then hit the travel agent and then go shopping for stuff at homeplus.  I've never been to a homeplus but I hear they are nice.  Some where in the middle of all this I'd like to go to the zoo.   I found a pretty good gym and signed up today.  It's not 100% better than the other gym, but a definite step in the right direction.  I now don't have a military press and the dumb bell selection does leave something to be desired but this is made up for with better leg machines, more, space, a much nicer locker room and workout clothes.   The weather is crappy today.  I hope it clears up tomorrow.   This weekend wasn't bad at all.  Dinner was at WABA with Jenny, GJ, and Caleb.  Tim then showed up.  We all migrated to a party that was being held on the roof of my building.  It was actually a pretty cool party.  There were a lot of people there and there was plenty of food and alcohol.  Now when I say there were a lot of people there I don't mean that many were cool or that I wanted to hang out with them.  Still the turnout was impressive.  I think Ursula now hates me b/c of my association with someone who thought she was crazy.  Oh well big loss there.  I'll explain an incident on from Caleb's blog.  Apparently he went looking of a bottle opener and asked a table of teachers for one, upon hearing this they proceeded to act dumbfounded b/c he might possibly be drinking beer.  I saw that table and I've met most of them.  The are the ultra lamo "we don't drink smoke or do anything people."  That is why they were sitting alone at their table doing nothing.  At some point the crew plus Jenny and her friends all ended up in my dirty as hell room.  We drank some vodka that I received for my birthday (thank you Asma) and then I ran everyone out.  We finally made it back downtown and first stop was TC.  Really not as bad as I remember it.  I think I almost had a good time.  At some point I broke off and went to funkaholic alone.  Pretty much a mistake.  Not many people.  This was corrected quickly as I left and went to AU.  On the way there I ended up running into the guy Mieka wants to ask out.  We started talking and went to hang out on the terrace at AU.  Pretty cool guy.  I was drunk and he wasn't so I don't have any clue what he thinks about me.  I then ended up at BB.  I hung out for a bit but this was the last stop for me.  At some point GJ was in trouble with his girlfriend, got forgiven, then got dumped but then they made up in a DVD room.  I'm guessing things are pretty much ok now.   I'm working on getting a page for pictures so I can put some faces to these people and places.   I wish I had a computer at my house.  This way I feel I could capture deeper thoughts as they come to me.  But I'll settle for this.  During the day there are always random thoughts that hit me about Korea or life in general but aren't important enough to hold onto so when I come here I lose them.   I had a really vivid dream last night.  It had Caleb and Gumi James in it.  It went something to the effect of that GJ was opening a bar called the "Golden Bear."  I think he might have had another night club or bar or something, I'm not sure, little hazzy.  Anyway I learned about it b/c Caleb was the publicist or something and was going around telling people about it.  So I finally went and it turned out to be pretty cool.  The End.

      Not much time to write since I'm on break between classes.  Quick hello goes out to Jessica.  I'll write more about you when I have time.  I'm up in Chil-gok today and it isn't too bad.  My first time in this part of town and it's pretty cool.  I think we'll have dinner again at WABA tonight.  I'm begining to like this tradition.  Living downtown is awesome.  I love living in the dorm.  The room isn't great or anything but it's the fact I'm so close to downtown.  The sliding doors leading to my blachony are kinda fucked and the floor is dirty but I'm loving the extra channels and lack of airplanes flying around at the ass crack of dawn.  Yesterday was fun.  I went to Festival after work with some LIKE people.  Pretty cool place.  Gyeh-son, Tim and crew showed up later on and we went to AU and then to Bubble for like a second.  At least I did.  I was out later then I expected.  There is come kind of party on the roof tonight.  I'm not sure if I'll attend.  I might show up to see whose there but Mark is one of the hosts and while I don't there is bad blood between us I wouldn't consider us friends.   I had Thursday off and didn't do much.  I had a great nights sleep and then bumbed around downtown.  I saw "50 first dates" and it pretty much sucked hard.  Before the movie Asma was nice enough to call me and we talked for awhile.  I had to give her the updates on everyone and how they are.  I wanted to see a baseball game but of course there wasn't one.   Ok Saturday night here I come.

      So here I am waiting to work.  I'm working at Man-ch'on like today.  This is the newest of LIKE schools.  I have to say it's pretty nice and has a little computer lab made up of 5 computers with internet access.  I was told I started work at 3:45 but turns out I start at 4:30.  Very typical of LIKE organization.  Anyway I have 7 classes today so this will suck.  They aren't my usual kids so I guess I don't care too much.   I moved downtown today so I'm hyped about that.  I'm on the 3rd floor and it seems pretty cool.  Room isn't all that big but the furniture is good, I have my own bathroom and I get more channels on the tv.  So all in all no complaints.  I'm so happy to be near downtown.  No more having to take taxis home and crap like that.  This should be a great way to save money.  I wonder how much money I've spent on taxis total since I've been in Korea.  Maybe it is better I don't know.  I have tomorrow off but I'm not exactly sure what I want to do.  I'm thinking about taking a day trip, but if I do then where will I go?  I'm thinking Busan.  On the other hand it would be good to just sit around and chill out.  Catch a movie, sit in Seattle's and get unpacked and settled in.  I don't know, we'll see how I feel tonight and see what time I get up at tomorrow.  For some reason I haven't been sleeping that well these past few nights.  I'm trying to get stuff squared away with Scott and this is taking forever.  Ugh.  I want to get plans for going to Thailand solidified as soon as possible.   I need a haircut.  But I'm too scared to get one.   LIKE teachers meeting today but I got to skip since I had to move.  The new guy taking my place seems like a dud.  He is a Mexican-American from Texas.  Maybe he and Brian can be best friends.  But he doesn't drink or go out and party or anything.  Oh well he can hang out in Bang-ch'on alone then b/c there isn't anywhere good around there anyway.  The floor of my new room is filthy.  I'll need to get that cleaned.  I'm not sure if the dude knew to take his shoes off.  Man it's really hot in this room.  The weather has been great lately.    I think things ended well between my manager and I.  He was nice enough to take me to lunch at Micky D's.  I'm curious to meet all the new people in the dorms and see if there is anyone worth hanging out with.  My guess in probably no but you never can tell.  I live on the same floor with a guy named Chris.  Some of you might know him as the "Sherminator."  Nice enough guy.   So I need to find a gym near downtown and get back to that.  My membership ran out last week so I haven't been in almost a week.  I already feel flabby.  Ok almost time to start.

      Ok I'll blog a little bit.  Everytime I'm in the PC room now I seem to be chatting.  I guess people are back on MSN now.  Becareful what you ask for b/c you just might get it.  The weekend was good.  Saturday was fun.  Dinner at WABA again.  Really I think this place might be a little bit of heaven on Earth.  Fenton claims he's found the place with the best kimchi in town  but we'll have to see about that.  Fenton's parents hung out again and we hit up the AU terrace after dinner.  This place is just a little bit phonominal.  The weather was great.  My friend Sue-Jin joined us.  Good to see her out.  She is sisters with one of the girls I used to work with.  Caleb also brought his old friend Angela out who I haven't seen in over a year.  So we played the finger a plenty.  And I managed to lose more then may fair share.  I think I'm going to retire from the finger game.  I never knew that when I started it it would catch on to the point of insanity.  I think we need some new drinking games.  I'm a fan of card drinking games.  After AU we went to Funkaholic.  Cool enough.  Ju-mi called me and I went to eat with her and her friends across the street.  We ended up in BB later on.  I was tired and not too drunk, which is good, so I called it a night.   Sunday was Gyeh-son's B-day so we ate at Bennigan's and then got some drinks and hit the singing room of all places.  Lord help me.  I'll write more later b/c there is more I want to say but this is all for now. No spell check

      No partying for me tonight.  I'm all partied out, at least for now.  I've had two late nights in a row and for whatever reason I just haven't been sleeping as sound as I should have been.  In interesting news I'll be moving downtown to the dorms on Wednesday.  This is really awesome.  I think I'll enjoy living downtown.  At least it will save me some taxi money.  Anyway a change is always good.  I don't really care for my manager or secretary.  My manager is a bumbling idiot and my secretary is just a bitch.  But she is ugly, mean and in general treats us "dirty foreigners" with a very removed manner.  I won't miss her a bit.  It's getting warm so I'm thinking we might have a roof party sometime soon.  My work will be moved to part time also.  I'll work less and get paid less.  Well this really depends on how much they work me but I'm hoping this is the case.  So I need to decided if I want to find more work or just eat up my free time.  We'll see how it goes.   So on Wednesday night I ended up downtown at first with Gumi James.  We hit up Miller Time first.  I think I really like Miller Time.  Nothing special but very functional: a big room with lots of people and even more beer.  So we kicked it until Tim showed up.  Then Jenny showed and shortly after Caleb joined us.  I think we need to have true guys night out sometime with NO GIRLS allowed.  It's a nice idea but I'm not sure I see it happening any time soon.  So we moved to Soldier Camp b/c I wanted to eat some sort of fried and salted spaghetti side dish and I wanted to indulge in the 5000cc.  This turned out to be a ton of beer.  Gumi James lost at something so Jenny told him to go bring some people over to play the finger game.  Instead of getting just one person he ended up getting 3.  Go figure.  I like Jenny, she seems really cool and fun.  Her friend on the other hand is really boring and bland.  At least it seems that way to me.  Note: friend was MIA tonight.  I do have to say though they did give me the most handsome friend award so that's cool.  Apparently out of a possible 100% I weigh in at 85%.  Gumi James gets 86% but I think is b/c he is with her.  Beckham got a 98% from them.  Gyeh-son joined us here.  She had some business with her boss and co-workers that need attending to.  From here we moved to AU.  By far the best place in Daegu and possibly Korea.  But no monkey.  So we had sausage and beer here.  Gumi James and I came back and crashed at my place.  He didn't have work on Thursday so he spent it with Jenny.  Over all an enjoyable time. So last night I ended up out eating with Hey-sook.  Despite being my ex-girlfriend we get along really well and I enjoy her company a great deal.  Things go kicked off at WABA.  For some reason this is where we always eat.  Seeing as how she hadn't been to AU I took it upon myself to take her to AU.  I just can't say enough about this place.  So we got stuck at the bar.  I say stuck but really it was cool.  I think when you're at the bar the bartenders are obligated to talk to you even if you're prefer not talk to them.  I ended up meeting at least half the bar staff last night, possibly more.  There is this dude named Curt who I've meet at least 3 maybe 4 times but he never remembers me.  This being probably b/c he is drunk off his ass every time.  No big loss the guy seems to be a zero.  He has been here a long as time and even worked for LIKE.  So I met him again last night.  From AU we went to Bellagio.  Now I love Bellagio but I have to say for a week night  I think AU is a better bet.  There were a pretty good amount of people there too, I think it's catching on.  Bellagio is better on a vibrant Saturday night when you've got a lot of hustle and bustle.  After that we called it a night.  I was out much later than I would have thought but all good b/c I had a great time.    One thing good about there being long gaps between you hit the PC room is that you get to catch up on everyone's blogs.  For some reason is it cool to have friends all over that you can keep up with by reading their journal.   Is anyone ever on MSN anymore?

      Oh the haps.  The keyboard I'm on really sucks.  I have to smash the "a" key to get it to work.  I guess there really isn't too much that happened this weekend of note.  I lost a lot at all sorts of drinking games on Saturday night.  Usually I can hold my own but it just wasn't meant to be.  My lack of sleep eventually caught up with me and I ended up at home fairly early by Saturday night standards.  We started with dinner at WABA.  Fenton's Parents joined us and it was a nice time.  I think we should eat dinner at seven every Saturday and make that a habit.  Doesn't always have to be WABA but if so that's cool too.  I dislike having to try and move around in large groups.  At some point I was at GR and it was a madhouse.   I love it when you find the perfect food to hit the spot.  This happened on Sunday when I went to the greatest little restaurant in Daegu to eat some soo-jae bee.  Wow this was some really good stuff.  I think GJ might be coming in town on Wed. night so I'm looking forward to hanging out then.  I miss going out on the week nights.  There seems to be nobody up for givener on weekdays.   I finally got a better memory card for my camera.  About damn time.  I've had it for 6 months and barely used it.  I've been waiting for my brother to mail me one like he said he would but looks like that never happened.   Work went rather quick today.   Saw The Passion of the Christ.  Pretty amazing movie.  I'm still out to lunch over some of the finer points but I have to say it was very powerful and moving.

      Ok I'll finish up about Saipan now, or at least try.  So we met up with our guide on Monday night and hung out with the girls that we ate dinner with at one of the nicer hotels.  They ended up being pretty cool after they finally relaxed and opened up.  The married one was even nice enough to pick up the bill for us.  Ok fast forward to the next morning.  Today was a lot of fun.  First my stomach was totally better so I was able to eat breakfast.  It wasn't a great breakfast but it was good enough.  We hit up a fiery and went to an Island that I won't even try to spell.  This place was just a bit amazing.  The water was just beautiful.  Really this was a slice of heaven.  It was also good to see Japanese girls in swim suits.  I think that in general Korean girls look better than the Japanese but the Japanese have attitude, style and pizaz (sp?).  Anyway it was funny b/c there was a section of the beach where the Japanese hung out and another part where the Koreans hung out.  There might have been 10 Koreans there so we went to Japanese part and kicked it.  The Japanese aren't nearly as interested in white people as the Koreans are.  We were the only round eyes around and nobody ever looked at us twice.  Tim and I walked around the island, threw the frisbee went swimming and just chilled out.  Great way to spend the morning.  I now have a really awkward strange burn on my chest from where I didn't rub the sun screen on completely.  So we caught the boat back and then did lunch.  Same western style restaurant but this time we went with the hamburger steak.  Actually it was a pretty darn good meal.  We then went to the hotel and had some free time until we left at 2:45 in the morning.  There was an optional cocktail show for something like a $100 so we politely declined.  Instead we grabbed a quick nap went shopping and then went downtown, if you can call it that.  Very uncharacteristically of me I managed to forget my address book so I wasn't able to send any postcards.  But I managed to calm myself and came to the conclusion I would just send them when I got back to Korea.  So we caught a taxi downtown but didn't have to pay b/c we took it to the duty free shopping place.  We hung out here for a while and looked around.  It was pretty interesting.  We then got dinner at the Hard Rock.  I think this turned out to be one of our better decisions.  The food and service was great and we were also entertained by an Elvis impersonator.  Not only that but we got our photos taken with him.  After dinner we wondered around and hit a few bars.  We went to the only real club in Saipan which is a place called GIG.  But they wanted $25 to get in on a Tuesday night.  Forget that.  So they had an outside bar that we hung out and got some beers at.  Taxis in Saipan are wicked expensive.  It cost us $13 to get back to our hotel and that was only about 10 minutes away.  All in all a great trip.  Too short but it always is.  Our tour guide ruled.  I wish I had gotten a picture with him before we left but we were pretty drunk and tired when it was time to call it a day.  Ok I might blog later today after work about all the happenings of the weekend.

      Nothing like a good night's sleep.  Last night I had the best night of sleep in my life, at least it seems like it.  I'm still not all caught up, but another sound night and I should be good to go for the weekend.  Tomorrow is payday so that's always good.  Ok I'll blog a bit about Saipan.  The story of the Saipan Givers Our journey started at Dong-Daegu bus station on Sunday where Tim and I caught the bus up to the Airport.  The plane didn't leave until a little after eight so we caught the bus at one.  This was really good b/c that meant I got to go out on Saturday night.  But of course I stayed out way too late and was dragging ass on Sunday.  But I sucked it up and we were on our way.  The ride to the airport seemed a little long and was a bit over 4 hours.  We hit some pretty ugly traffic.  But as always we were dropped of right at the airport in perfect time to meet the guys who had our tickets and other goodies.  This being taken care of we decided to get some Sparro.  Not as good as in the states me thinks, but    for Korea it is was awesome.   I really love Inchon airport.  It is loaded with all kinds of cool stuff to do while you wait.  So we ate and then made it through security and to our gate.  Got the money changed and before we knew it we were on the plane.  Before I go any farther, why are women always dressed up so well when the go to the airport?  Or is it that only hot girls go to the airport.  Either way whenever I'm at the airport there seem to be a great deal of good looking women.  Tim agrees with  me on this.  I just couldn't be bothered trying to look good when I have a 4 hour bus ride followed by a 4 hour flight.  But I guess that is the difference between men and women.   So the flight out was cool.  I love Korean airlines b/c they only let hot girls work as flight attendants.  None of this equal opportunity crap.  If you're hot and can speak enough English then you're in.  Or so it seems.   On the way there we got to eat and I decided to go with the seafood stir fry.  Bad idea, this would prove to haunt me later.   As soon as we stepped out of the airport it was obvious we were in Saipan.  The weather was great, much like Georgia.  Warm and humid with a cool breeze.  We met up with our tour guide who was seemed really awesome.  There were only 6 other people on our tour.  An elderly couple and a family of four.  Unlike Shanghai we didn't get to know them and actually barely saw them at all.  So we piled in the bus and rolled to the hotel.  Our hotel turned out to be the Saipan Grand.  Great hotel.  Not the most modern or blinging, but right on the beach and had plenty of English tv stations for us to flip through.  I'm not sure how much or well I slept, I was pretty excited.   It's Monday morning now and the stomach is feeling a little funny.  Not bad exactly, but funny.  We head down to get some breakfast but  after sipping a glass of water I decided it's best to take it easy and I head back upstairs to chill for a bit and lay down again.  Remember the seafood on the plane?  Yeah I think that it was involved.  At this point I was just hoping I wasn't going to get seriously sick or anything.  So we all got together around 10 and went sight seeing.  Our tour guide was a Korean guy who moved to Saipan 10 years ago.  He was so dark you could barely tell he was Korean.  His English wasn't perfect but it was pretty darn good.  He also had a pretty rad haircut.  So we piled back into the van and too off to see the sights.  First stop was the Korean peace memorial.  Didn't think we'd see that since we were on a Korean tour.  Nothing too special there so we moved on.  Next was the Banzi and Suicide cliffs.  This was a little more impressive.  I have to say the water in Saipan is just the most amazing ever.  From there it was onto the last command bunker of the Japanese.   Very cool.  It's always really interesting to see stuff that has true historical meaning.  We then kicked it over to a place called bird island.  At this point it became really obvious we were in tropical paradise.  These are pretty much all the sights really worth seeing so after we headed to duty free shopping.  This is where stuff got interesting.  Our tour guide apparently takes care of more then one group at the same time.  So another group he was looking after was a group of four Korean girls.  So he asked Tim and I if we'd skip out on DFS and head with him to meet these girls for lunch.  Duh, of course.  So we went and picked them up from the hotel.  I have to say at first it was a little awkward b/c it almost all feel on me to make conversation.  Of course they were all shy and shit like that.  One of them was married and had a son.  She turned out to be pretty cool as she was the least afraid to talk.  She really didn't speak any English but I could understand most of what she was saying and at least she tried.  The restaurant we ate at had a country western theme and it was pretty funny.  I went with the Spaghetti.  I was a little worried about the stomach but hadn't been too bad so I gave it a shot.  Turns out I was able to eat and keep it down so no worries.  We then dropped them off at a spa and went back to our hotel to kick it.  From here on out we had free time.  We just laid on the beach and did nothing.  I tried to nap but it was just a little too windy.  So finally I went to my room and grabbed a cat nap.  Tim read away in his book.  We skipped out on the optional dinner which was insanely expensive which meant we were on our own.  Lucky for us there was Church's chicken right down the road.  How cool is that?  So we made a pit stop for fried chicken and it was really darn good.  I got the 2 which came with two sides.  I'm the kind of guy who likes a lot of fries.  So I asked for both sides as fries.  I figured they would be pretty small servings and that 2 would be just right.   I couldn't even begin to imagine how many fries this girl put on my plate.  Thank  goodness I was with Tim, he was nice enough to give me a hand.  We also got to watch Sponge Bob on the tv here.  After this we went for a little walk and checked out a shopping center.  We got some much needed sun cream and I picked up a 3 muskateers.  On I think that's all for now I'll fill in the rest later.

      Somehow I'm still not where I should be, which is in bed asleep.  Well I did manage to get through work without any serious problems from my lack of sleep.  This is good b/c I sure as hell don't want to work Sunday morning.  I hate working Sunday mornings.  Last time my experiance sucked really hard, this probably being due to the fact that I had no sleep what so ever.  Anyway I still don't have the energy to talk about Saipan but maybe tomorrow.  I did housever have enough to do another quiz.    urlLink     urlLink How evil are  you ?   I love Scott but he is an idiot.  My visa expires tomorrow so I have to go to immigration with him.  He's already canceled on me twice.  If I get in some sort of trouble I'm not  going to be happy.  Things should be cool.  It just really annoys me that he is busy to the point that he is constantly forgetting shit and having to cancel.  Anyway I'm off to bed.

      Ok so Saipan is basically tropical paradise.  It is everything and more that Caleb made it out to be.  I'm way too tired to go into detail about we'll say it was a good trip.  Definitely too short but a good trip.  I'm currently sitting my ass in the airport as I wait for the atms to start working so I can get some money to buy a bus ticket to go the hell home.  I think I'll actually try and work today just so I don't have to go in on Sunday.  The atms here are stupid.  I really hate them.  If the worked at, say 7 o'clock, Mr. Papp and myself could have been on our way home.  I reality we are only getting set back a little over and hour so it isn't a big deal but it's the principle of the matter.  Why don't they work?  And why isn't there a sign explaining it?  Jeez, sometimes Korea baffles me.  I also need to go to Immigration.  I was supposed to go on Friday with Scott but as you can guess that feel apart somehow.  The funny thing is that my visa runs out tomorrow and if I don't go I'm going to be in some hot water.  I think really all I have to do is pay a fine but still that ain't cool.  Ok I think this is about all for now.  I'll recount the past weekend and the trip to Saipan another time.  Despite that this PC room is a bit expensive it is still a great idea to kill time in the airport.

      In an effort to remedy my poor blogging habits I fear I may have over corrected as I feel I am blogging almost every day or close to it.  Today I had a nice lunch with the girls from Seoul.  I then sent them on their way to Hae-in-sa.  This is a temple with original wooden carvings of the teaching of Buddha on them.  Pretty cool place.  I went there back in August I think.  They are coming back tomorrow and we'll head out then.  I met them today in Dong Daegu Station and there was all kinds of commotion going on for some reason.  Turns out the KTX started today which for those of you who don't know, it's the new bullete train.  There were tons of police and even SWAT officers out with sub-machineguns and everything.  Pretty wild.  There was also someone of some kind of importance that showed up to the station b/c he was mobbed by supporters and there were plenty of TV cameras and photographers trying to get a shot.  Honestly I have no clue who the hell it was.  Couldn't have been that important b/c there weren't that many people.  I do have to say the newly renovated part of the station is really nice.   I think I'll stay in tonight again.  It's been doing me well to not go out so much.  Too expensive and just too rough on the body.  I hate it when you go to bed and you know you're tired but you just can't seem to fall asleep.  This happened last night.  I went to bed early but just couldn't seem to fall asleep.  I either had to go to the bathroom or my foot itched or I was too hot, then too cold, always something.  Anyway I finally got some sleep.  I've been slacking off some at the gym so I plan to spent a decent amount of time there after work.  I figure I'll be out tomorrow night and then again on Saturday night.  Saturday the festivities will start early.  Caleb and I have  tossed around the idea of doing a 7 to 7 night but I don't think I can.  I have to fly out to Saipan on Sunday and I just can't risk screwing that up.  I know he'll question my "giver status" but that used to that by now.   I would really like to change my job.  I wonder if it is possible?   It is April fools day but I still haven't made any jokes or pulled any pranks yet.  I wonder if they even know what April fools day is in Korea.   I have to give a public apology to my homie Serd in the WR.  I forgot his b-day.  My bad yo.   It is good to see people are leaving interesting posts on my tagboard.   I know what I need to do tonight, I need to go to the local E-mart like store and look for a memory card for my camera.  I bought this nice Sony digicam before I came over here and I've barely used it.  This being b/c it came with a 12Mb memory chip.  My brother said he'd send me another but here I am almost six months later without one.  Anyway I have to get that taken care of before Saipan.  I also need some sun block.  I got a killer burn in Malaysia last year and I have no intentions of repeating that.  Oh Saipan I can barely wait.

      I'm too tired for a really good update but I'll put a little effort forth.  I took today off from the crazy touring.  I went and saw another temple.  It was nice but at this point it really was just another temple.  I then went off to a mega mall shopping complex and watched movies, shopped and at for most of the day.  I saw Van Helsing and The Day After Tomorrow.  I figure I need to get as many movies in now while I can.  Niether was great but I enjoyed both.  The Day After Tomorrow was a bit better in my opinion.  It was really awesome and a bit strange to be at the shopping center.  On one hand it was ultra mondern clean and could have fit into any city in America.  On the other had it was in Bangkok and I was almost the only whitie around.  This is b/c it was a bit off of the touristy path.  I wasn't as comfortable as I would have been if was in Korea but it was great none the less.  I hate the fact that I only know a few words in Thai.  Thai isn't a very pretty language but I wish I could communicate more.  What was really interesting was just seeing the average Thai person doing their thing.  When you're out see stuff it's always people trying to sell you shit or take you somewhere or something like that.  And then at night it's women trying to get you to pay for sex.  A good change of scene for the day.   Last night wasn't as crazy as Saturday but it was fun none the less.  GJ and I went to a club named "Bed."  Yeah I know what you're thinking, that's a pretty lame name for a club.  But then think of it this way.  "Who are you going to bed with tonight?"  Unfortunatly my answer is "I went to bed with Gumi James."  But whatever.  This is the premier club in Bangkok where all the high rollers and celebs hang out.  It was pretty posh with a great selection of alcohol.  Gumi was looking for a white belt the whole trip and found a bartender there who had one.  The guy was obviously gay so Gumi put on the English charm and managed to buy it off of him.  Pretty bad ass.  We then went to a place called Nana and shot some pool and then went home.  Ok I'm tired and going to bed.  Check with GJ for full details.  Good night.

      So this is more or less our last day here as GJ leaves tomorrow morning at 7am.  I did manage to track him down yesterday.  We were running around in circles looking for each other.  We did hit the zoo up and walked around a different part of town.  I think GJ is a little toured out.  We've seen a ton sights and now he's gone shopping crazy.  I'm cool with whatever he wants to do b/c I'll have another two days here or so after he leaves so I'll do whatever it is I want to then.  Speaking of that I think I want to catch a movie.   The zoo wasn't great but I thought it was good enough.  Like everything in Thailand it was cheap and it was about what I expected.  GJ was a little disappointed b/c we didn't see any rhinos.   The walk there and back was cool.  We got to see the government buildings and the place where the king lives I think.  We had a chill evening and then got turned around and hit the clubs.  I'll have to write more about that tomorrow b/c I just don't have the motivation to do it justice now.   The 7 elevens here have coke slushies and that in and of itself has made the trip worthwhile.  I need to sit down and write in my diary.  There are so many little funny incidents I'm afraid of forgetting that have really made the trip so much fun.  I'd write about them here but they'd only be interesting to me so I'll spare you.   No plans for today except to go out one last time tonight and giver hardcore.  I just can't be bothered with spell check.

      So the first night in Bangkok equaled "ping pong show" and I have to say it was pretty darn impressive.  The ping pong show is a sex show of sorts where women do some very interesting stuff with there private parts.  These interesting acts included the use of ping pong balls, darts (blowgun style of course), cigarettes, whistles, chopsticks, horns and bottles (which were opened).  This was all in the Pat Pong district which is pretty much a tourist attraction in and of itself.  Basically all it sells is sex and pretty nasty bars.  We hopped around a bit and finally landed at a less seedy place with live music.  The girls were still suspect as I think they were just looking for white guys with deep pockets.  Either way it was a really good and educational time.   We're currently on our third full day here and GJ is MIA.  He said he was going to go look at the internet somewhere but hasn't been back since.  I don't know if I was supposed to go meet him or what.  I think we're going to take it a little easier today and not do so much.  Our first two days we went pretty crazy and saw a ton of stuff.  The first day we did the really big stuff like the Temple of the Jade Buhdda, the Royal Palace, National Museum, Wat Pho and the National Art Gallery.  Then at night we hit Pat Pong.  We did a ton of walking and the heat took a lot out of us.  Yesterday we went to a few less popular sights but still really impressive.  We saw a 5.5 ton solid gold Buhdda statue.  I'm curious as to how much something like this would be worth.  We also hiked up the Mount of Gold temple.  This provided for a great view of Bangkok.  We then cruised over to a snake farm to see a snake show.  This was the coolest snake show I've ever seen in my life.  At one point the guy was taking the King Cobra away and walked within 2 feet of me.  That's the last time I ever want to be that close to the snake.  From there we walked some more hit a temple, the central park and then saw some kick boxing.  Kick boxing was cool at first but after awhile it was the same old thing and go pretty boring.  We watched about 5 bouts and left.  GJ then wanted to shop some more so we hit the night bazaar.  This was really nice but a little more price than shopping in the streets.  We were going to call in and just hang out on Khao San road but GJ got really motivated and we headed out to hit some cool Thai clubs, like the kind where normal Thai people go to.  We managed to find the coolest club ever, only catch was that you had to have your passport to get in.  Of course we didn't bring our fucking passports out.  So that was the end of that.  But the night wasn't lost as we managed to find two other really cool spots to hang.  Thai women are really good looking.  The only problem is none of these places had dance floors in the sense that we know them.  It was more like you danced where ever you could find space.  A little awkward but fun none the less.   I'm not sure what we'll do today.  I need to find GJ first.  Luckly I'm keeping occupied doing this.  I think we'll hit the zoo and take it easy.  I need to find some postcards.  Tuk tuks are a rip off.  Taxis are so cheap here its not even funny.  Not to mention they all want to take you places to shop so they can get kick backs.  It's so crazy how everyone is trying to sell you something here.  Everyone wants to start some kind of dialouge just so they can tell you somewhere you want to go is closed so they can get you to go somewhere else.  What crap.  Anyway you get used to it and blow them off.   Where the hell is GJ?  That ding a ling.  Ok I'll go look for him and see where the hell he went?  I'm at the pc in the lobby of our hotel so I'd hope he'd have the common sense to look down here for me since he knew I was coming here.   More later.

      Well I managed to make it to Thailand safely so that's a good start.  GJ and I found a pretty darn good place to stay and just ate some great food.  To top it all off we're now in a little computer room typing away.  I'm not sending much mail b/c this computer takes forever to do just about anything.  I sent one to my parents and that's gonna be all for now I think.  Thailand is really cool and I look forward to the next 4 days or so.  I'm so glad to have a break from Korea for awhile.  But I realize by the time this is all over I'll be so happy to get back there.  We're basically staying near the "Itawon" district in Bangkok so there are tons of whities around.  I'm not sure exactly what we'll do tomorrow but I think we'll hit up some of the major sights.   Last night was a lot of fun.  Thanks for the warm send off guys.  We played drinking board games at a board game cafe.  It was bitter sweet b/c they had alcohal but not the game we wanted, Risk.  But it all worked out well in the end.  I had to say my good-byes to Tim but I hope at some point I'll see him again.

      So I leave at 3:30am tonigh/tomorrow morning (depending on how you look at it).  I'm not going to write much more about this weekend despite it being really run.  I guess I'm just not motivated.  On a quick note I made peace with Mark who I used to have some sort of ill will against for something that transpired with Michelle a long time ago.  I also took a stroll through the red light district again.  This time I was sober and able to appreciate it a bit more I think, if you can call it appreciation.  For those of you who don't know the red light district is kind of like window shopping.  You walk down these streets and all these girls are decked out in dresses and makeup sitting behind windows.  So you just go shopping till you see one you like and pick her out.  Supposedly the only service foriegners but suprisingly enough not only was I talked too this time around but I was propositioned by one of the pimps.  Oh yeah the pimps are really old ugly ladies.  "Short time" was only 60k, about $50 U.S.  Somehow I managed to decline.  The reason I ended up here is because Arabian Nights was right across the street.  Go figure.  Arabian Nights is also absolutly huge.  There were no tables for us so we forked over a ton of dough and got a private room.  This came with booze, a private bathroom, and a kareoke machine.  Pretty cool stuff.  Ok enough about that. I'm ready to up and go.  I'm so darn tired I think I'll sleep the whole bus ride there as well as the flight.  I've gotten almost all my ducks in a row.  I picked up my sunglasses today and got all the money transactions taken care of at the bank.  I'd like to get to E-mart to get some stuff like sunscreen an extra padlock and a flashlight but I think I can get most of these at the airport.   Some of the guys and I should be getting together to hang out tonight.  This will be the last time I get to hang out with Tim as he's getting out of here in around 2 or 3 weeks.  This sucks cause he's a pretty cool guy.  While I want to have fun I need not get totally plastered or else it'll be an even longer ride to the airport.   Ok I stole Mieka's quiz.  Also the tag board is clean so lets all act a little more mature regarding out posts on it please.  Apologies go out to any and all who were offended.  urlLink     Where do you fall on the liberal - conservative political spectrum?  (United States)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   I'm conservative, big surprize there.

      Man I'm worn out.  I don't have much energy to blog in depth so I'll just hit some highlights.  This weekend was rocking.  I was out Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and all were good times.  The highlight was Arabian Nights on Saturday which I'll talk about more later I think.  I leave early on Wednesday morning so I'm making final preperations now.  I have a few more things to do but for the most part I'm ready.  Everyone wish me luck.

      I've been playing around with this blogger stuff and I've now figured out how to add a title, and correct the time to correspond with Korean time.  Pretty cool.  Wonder what else they have?   Troy was pretty cool.  Write more later, gotta work.

      I managed to pull a muscle in my back this morning.  I slept all wrong and aggrivated it while I was at the gym.  This proved for a pretty week work out.  Got tickets to see Troy so I'll let you kids know how it is.   In sad news it looks like Tim might be leaving sometime soon for good.  If this is the case then we need to get crazy this weekend b/c it will probably be the last weekend I can see him since I'm heading out on Wednesday.  Arabian Night's looks like a go.  We need a cool Korean to come with us.  Anyone who has a cool Korean laying around let us know.   I went to the travel agent and got things squared away and I then to the bank to see about travelers checks.  I'm ready to get out of here and hit the road.   I've been doing a really good job keeping up with e-mail.  I'm very proud of myself. I hope I only have 5 classes today.

      Troy opened today.  I want to see it today but Gyeh-son really wants me to wait for her.  Bummer, oh well it's not like it's going anywhere fast.   I managed to stay up the better part of the night last night playing computer games with my friend Serd who is in Georgia.  We pretty much kicked some ass.   The Braves had a perfect game pitched against them by Randy Johnson.  So yeah they pretty much suck this season.  I'm not giving up all hope but I'm not holding my breath either. Tomorrow stuff should be final for Gumi James and as we're heading off to Thailand.  I need to go and get some traveler checks and make sure I have everything I need.   I don't think I'll ever sit on the lower level of McDonald's in front of a window again and eat.  I'm not sure Koreans have ever seen a westerner eat McDonalds.  I figured it would be a good place to watch people walk by and carry on their business.  Little did I know it reality it was going to be the other way around.  I had people point, stare, wave and do about everything else you can imagine.  What annoys me is that they probably think I eat it all the time but whatever.  Anyone who lives and or has lived here pretty much knows that Koreans don't know a hole heck of a lot so this explains a lot.  Other then that lunch was great.  I even had a coupon for a free ice cream cone so you know that made me happy.

      Well I think I'm done tinkering with the page for tonight.  Let me know what you think.  Caleb gives it a thumbs up.  Michelle your page doesn't seem to be working so I didn't link to it and Andy you never update so I didn't like to yours.  Let me know if this changes and I'll and links to you guys pages. "Dawn of the Dead" is pretty darn cool.  For the type of movie it was it was really pretty darn good.  I do wonder what a horror movie would be like if they didn't have stupid people making stupid decisions all the time.  Probably pretty boring.   Turns out one of the guys on my floor turned in his letter of resignation yesterday.  He is an older fellow named Robert.  Nice enough I guess but he is looking to do some serious teaching so he's at the wrong place.  He is annoyed that the Kims are letting him design and give out level tests.  They keep saying that they forget but that's probably bullshit.  Either way he's annoyed enough to up and leave so oh well.   Hold on while I try something else on my page.

      Wow I think I got carried away on that last post.  I had a hell of a lot of typos too.  If you couldn't figure out what I was saying go back and try again as I've now proof most of it.  Not much really new to say.  It seems I've been noticing a lot of stuff lately.  First is that there are a lot of homeless/crazy Koreans.  Much more then I thought there were.  I think this is b/c I live downtown and I get to see them all the time.  Also it seems that there are a lot more tall girls.  Man, I don't know how I missed this before.   I'm going to watch Dawn of the Dead tonight.  From what others have said I think I'll enjoy it.  I'm not expecting much but I never do when I watch a movie in Korea.  I only want to be entertained.   I've found my new love is for a McDonald's ice cream cone and a cookie.  The combintaion of the two is absolutly delicious.  I use the cookie to scoop the ice cream off the cone make an "ice cream cookie" so to speak.  Really good, I suggest you try it.  Micky D's also has some really good cookies I have to admit.   I should be out of here next Wednesday for those of you who don't know.  I'll be flying to Bangkok with Gumi James and then I'll head off alone from there.  I should head East through Cambodia, taken in the sights along the way.  Then I'll roll into Vietnam and move South to North.  I'll then come around into Laos and finally back into Thailand.  I'm pretty darn excited.  There is a lot that I want to see.   This weekend should be Arabian Night's unless the Pappmaster decides not to go again.  I hope to have an extra "crazy" weekend before my trip.  Oh, it should last in the realm of 2 and a half months.  If anyone wants postcards be sure you get me your address.

      Here it is on Monday.  I don't think I have to work today.  Well I might have to but I'm not going to unless they call me on my cell phone.  I left the house at around noon and they hadn't called me as of yet so I don't feel bad about skipping out, if in fact that is the case. This was a good weekend.  Friday wan't anything crazy but it was fun.  I hung out with Hey-sook til the early ours of the morning.  I've found out WABA is pretty much dead and dead.  We went to eat Sam-gyup sal at another restaurant and come to find out they had WABA's chairs.  So we asked as to how this came to be and what the future of WABA looked like.  Well it doesn't look good and we'll just leave it at that.   Saturday was a full can of worms to say the least.  I had work at Chil-gok.  This really isn't that bad at all, in fact I enjoy the change in scenery.  I was dressed up in black pants and whatnot b/c I thought we were going to Arabian Nights, but this was not to be the case.  Work was a breeze, only 5 classes.  I hooked it up with Caleb and we hopped a taxi down to Daegu station and grabbed Gumi James.  We then went to VIPS and pigged out like no tomorrow.  VIPS is price but damn is it good.  For those of you who don't know it's an all you can eat western style buffet.  We could barely move afterward.  We then went to a party.  I Gumi and I really didn't know anyone we just went with Caleb.  I was nice and coozy but a little too tame for given the fact I didn't know any of them and I wasn't going to put much effort forth to meet them.  Gumi and I split.  He hit up TC and I bumped into Hey-sook again as she was downtown.  Then the two of us went to Bellagio.  I'll cover what happened at TC first even though I wasnt' there.  Now Tim was the one who was really pushing to go to Arabian Nights but I'd tried to call him and I couldn't get a hold of him so he never told me he didn't want to go this weekend.  None of us knew what happened to him but turns out he ended up at TC drinking like mad.  By the time Gumi got there he was trashed and asked Gumi to buy him a drink that would "fuck him up."  Well apparently Gumi did just that.  They each did a shot of 151.  Not 5 seconds later Tim was running for the bathroom when about half way up the stairs he lost it.  Then again on the bathroom floor and again in the sink.  Gumi was nice enough to throw him in a cab and send him home.  I called him the next day and he seemed to be doing fine.  I had to tell him about the whole thing as he didn't remember any of it.  But no permanent damage was done.   So Bellagio was fun but not nearly that interesting.  We sat at the bar and shot the shit.  I haven't been there in a little time so it was good to see Connan and all.  I also ended up talking to the other bartender named Xess.  He confessed that he was jealous that I always said hello and good-bye to Connan and that he wanted to be my friend b/c I was handsome and nice.  Man I love this country, at least at times like this I do.  We ended up getting one free round as well.  Xess threw away a napkin I had made into a flower for Hey-sook on accident, he didn't know it was a flower, just looked like a napkin.  Anyway I think the free drink was the opportunity to strike up a conversation.  So it was a good time.  After that we headed to Funkaholic where we met back up with Caleb and Gumi.  Gumi had managed to pick up two girls on his way here.  He ended up dumping one of them off on me.  We promised to eat sam-gyup sal sometimes and then I ran away.  Funkaholic is actually pretty cool and seems to have realy picked up.  There were a hell of a lot of people there.  We then split out and headed over to GR.  Now I was waiting outside alone and while I was waiting there was a group of GI's attempting not to kick the shit out of each other.  They were drunk and one of the guys was intent on starting something with one of the other guys.  At this point it's about 3 am and I'm wondering what the hell is up with the military curfew.  I when Caleb came out we left.  I have not inclination to be around those boobs.   GR was pretty rocking.  We were there for only about an hour but it was great fun.  I was about to say there weren't many foreigners but that would be wrong.  What I will say is there weren't many forgien Engish teachers.  What was there were plenty of GI's and the Pak attack from hell.  I've seen Pakis at this place before but not like Saturday night.  Asma be glad you weren't there.  You would have been forced into marraige, killed or something.  Now here is the best part, it enough to just be there an dancing but they overran the stage.  I think there were like 5 over them on stage at some point.  Wild.  We closed out GR and then Hey-sook went home.  Caleb, GJ and I then headed to BB.  This place was packed like no tomorrow.  It was hopping but half the guys in there were GIs and I just have to confess I don't want to hang out or be around these guys, and they were everywhere.  At this point GJ and I went to get some food leaving Caleb to do his thing.  We got some food at the place we always eat at come that hour of the morning.  Food was good and about 30 minutes later Caleb shows up with his umbrella which has been beaten to hell.  At this point he's pretty riled up b/c he ran into KY(his ex-girlfriend) and had been hitting shit with his umbrella on the way to the restaurant.  I thought he was drunk out of his mind but turns out he wasn't as drunk as I thought, I figured this out a little later.  So he's being all loud and eating all the food with his hands.  I tell the old lady running the place it's cool he's our friend.  We leave and then Caleb proceeds to beat the living shit out of a metal ramp with what is left of his umbrella.  After completeing this he chunked it down into the enterance of Flair Bar.  At this point I still think he's drunk so I go get it b/c I figure he'll regret doing that once sobber.  I get the umbrella and come back to find Caleb bowing to a penis balloon promising never to mistreat it again.  At this point Gumi James heads for the train station and Caleb and I got to find KY.  So we had messaged her and she finally messaged back.  We were walking back to BB, and this is where things get really interesting, when we pass two GI's.  One is bleeding profusly from the back of his head and the other is helping his friend along and holding napkins to prevent further blood loss.  As we pass the guy who was fucked up he says with a drunken stupid grin "I got hit with a beer bottle."  Well good for him.  So we get back to BB.  We'll hang here til we figure out where KY is.  There is all kinds of commotion going on outside since there was obviously a big fight.  It was all between GIs too.  They are bragging and yelling and whatever the hell else.  I attempt to find out what happened.  From what I gather someone's friend got sucker punched and then some girl got hit so some other guys ganged up on this dude then someone else.....whatever.  So we wait.  We're chilling by the enterance while one of the guys involved in the fight is being all cool and talking to some girl, then out of nowhere one of the guys involved earlier walks up and knocks the shit out of this guy.  Caught him totally off gaurd and knocked him the fuck out.  You see movies where people just exchange punches one after the other but that couldn't be further from the truth.  This guy crumbled like house of cards.  He wasn't a small guy either, but then again niether was the guy who nailed him.  So the first guy gets hit and goes down, out cold.  The second guy then jumps on him and pounds him and starts yelling something about his friend this and that.  First thing I do is grab Caleb and move.  This all trnaspired about 3 feet away from us.  Some other GIs break it up and the guy goes inside.  I've never seen anyone get knocked out before but it was a pretty sobbering experiance.  So then all kinds of needless crazy drama takes place with people threatening to kick other peoples's asses, talk about calling the cops and MPs.  I have to say I've honestly never been so ashamed to be American in my life.  This is how other countries see us.  This is there impreession of us.  They see our military go out get drunk, cause problems and beat the shit out of each other.  Man, I went home on a really low note.  These are the people who are "protecting the free world."  Where the hell is curfew?  I really hope it was a one weekend pass thing or something b/c I dread spending any other Saturday nights out with these guys.  Enough said about that. Like I said Caleb and I moved and he was propped up on the hood of a car.  We waited but KY never messaged back.  Caleb seemed pretty sober and wanted to eat with some people from Chil-gok so I went ahead and rolled home.  I will say there is never a dull moment in Korea.  I hope I didn't forget anything.

      Not a whole lot to say.  I'm on break now so I'll just blog for a bit.  I think my part time status might be jeapordy.  I found out yesterday one of the LIKE teachers mother's died so she will be going back to South Africa to visit and take care of whatever needs to be taken care of.  My guess is that b/c she will be gone I'll probably be filling in for her.  I didn't really know the teacher very well but she seemed nice enough and she gets my sincerest condolences.   I don't know why I'm unable to get a good nights sleep but it's really begining to bother me.  Oh well.  Not much I can do I guess.  I leave in less than two weeks anyway.  I played some Star Craft online with my friend Serd from the states.  The connection was pretty darn good considering I'm here and he's there.   Tomorrow I'll have to try and send home money again.  This will be the third time I've tried.  This is getting a little silly.  It can't be that difficult can it?  I've got all the information I should need but somehow stuff just doesn't seem to be working.  What a pain in the ass.  I really hope I get some time off next week.   Last night was a bust.  I ended up not doing anything but eating with some of the teachers I worked with and going home.  A break from the downtown nightlife isn't all bad though.  My liver could use the break.  I need to hit the gym after work today.  Lucky for me I get done at 7:30.  I love having internet at work.  I should find some more quizzes but I'm just too lazy.  I want to play some board games.

      It is pretty cool to have internet at work.  It's raining again today.  What the hell is wrong with the weather in this country.  I should have tomorrow off so I'm looking forward to that.  Time off is pretty awesome.  No real plans.  It'll probably rain at the rate things have been going.  I should hook up with some of the guys tonight for what should be a pretty low key night out.  This is good b/c I was pretty hardcore on the weekend and for whatever reason I still can't seem to get a great night's sleep.   Atlanta Braves baseball is sucking it up.  I know it's still early in the season but it looks like the run might be over.  This is a little painful but I'm sure I'll survive.  Hopefully they'll be able to get themselves together and pull out of it.   WABA is still closed and I'm not sure if it'll reopen or not.  This is a pretty sad deal to me.  I should be eating some steamed pork tonight with Fenton so hopefully this will do me well.  He claims to have found the place with the best kimchi.  I'm a little skeptical but we'll see.   I need to some get some prescription sunglasses before I head off a traveling.

      I love days off.  So relaxing and peaceful.  Today I took my hand at Apsan.  This is a mountin in the South of Deagu.  I managed to make it there and took the cable car to the top.  I've climbed it before but on a different section and I always wanted to take the cable car.  I got a little lost but was finally able to find my way.  It was pretty cloudy but I could pretty much make out where I lived.  Anyway it was good fun.   This evening I tried my hand at getting another Korean haircut.  Yeah I finally decided to cut the hair.  I've been trying to get Sara to cut it but she is always busy so I broke down and went somewhere today.  It isn't that bad actually.  They can never seem to do the sides exactly right but it's good enough.  The dude styled it pretty bad but he cut it well.  I can always restyle it so no big deal.  I'm so tired lately.  I wonder if I've got mono or something.  Anyway I'll keep this short and try to get a good nights sleep tonight.   Caleb wants to head out tomorrow night so Tim I'll be calling you.  Anyone else who reads this blog and wants to join is welcome.  I'm out, as opposed to in.  That was lame.

      Well you go to a cheap pc room and you get a cheap PC.  So I guess I deserve the harsh treatment I'm getting from this pos.  First I'd like so say that the story I read on  urlLink Becky's blog  is seriously some of the most disturbing stuff I've ever read.  I can't believe we live in this kind of world and my heart really goes out to the victim.  Best of luck to her.   On a much less serious note Korean Oreos are fucking disgusting.  I've been looking forward to eating them lately and you can't imagine how disappointed I am at how horrible they taste.  Korean snacks in general are pretty crappy.  They taste somewhere between cardboard and sawdust.   This weekend was pretty darn good.  At first Saturday seemed like it would be a bust as Gyeh-son and I had a spat.  But that was resolved and I managed to salvage the night.  From there it got a little crazy.  Gumi James is now the soju mixing master.  He went on a run to the store for soju b/c he was broke.  He brought back what looked to be 3 normal juice bottles.  But little did we know they were spiked with the Korean alcohol.  We had mango, apple and grape.  All of which were pretty good.  Thanks go out to Mieka, Jeff, Tim and Lee who all helped me through the night at some point.  Either by buying me a drink or food or lending money.  We made it to GR which was bouncing.  Then from there it was to BB and then I grabbed food with Mieka.  I started slow but ended up pretty lit up.  Sunday was slow.  I spent most of the day in bed recovering.  Oddly enough it didn't seem like a waste.  It was kind of a relief to just be able to lay around and do nothing.  That night I watched "One Hour Photo" at a DVD room and I have to say it was pretty good.   I'm pretty pooped.  I have to write some e-mails.  I had a Korean slurpie.  I thought it would be more like an icie but I was wrong.  You live you learn I guess.  Seems a lot of people have bad body oder lately.  I wonder why it is and I wonder why it's always around me?  Do people who stink know they stink?  They can't, or else they'd do something about it.  Who knows.  I have to do some e-mail.

      All this time off and I still feel like I have no time.  I'm really tired.  I don't know what it is or why I'm not sleeping as well as I should be but it's really annoying.  Anyway things seem to be a hell of a lot more annoying when you're tired.  I have to go to the bank tomorrow and see why my money hasn't reached my account in the states.  This kind of stuff is a real pain in the ass.   I went to a baseball game for the first time yesterday and that was a lot of fun.  The Lions got pounded but get this.  They were up by 5 going into the 9th.  Then the other team managed to score 5 to tie it up.  Then they scored 6 more in the 11th.  What a mess.  The stadium is pretty small by werstern standards but nice enough.  I have work tomorrow.  I guess it is good I'm going to do something conrstructive.   I'm really looking forward to traveling soon.  I just want a break from the madness.   On a sad note WABA is closing for remodeling.  I can't imagine that it would really be closed.  That would just be terrible and I think I'd have to leave Korea forever.  Ok I'm just going to go home and get some sleep.  I feel like I should have more to say but I just don't.   Oh well I do have one thing.  Fenton, Caleb, Gyeh-son and I ate at Bennigans last night and as always all of our hamburgers and bacon were under cooked.  Anyway Gyeh-son complained and we all ate for free.  I felt a little bad b/c I enjoyed the hamburger despite it being a little pink.  But heck it was free so I shouldn't complain.  Also, I hate Koreans and cell phones.

      What crappy weather.  I had no work today and it was really pretty awesome.  I got plans made for traveling.  Gumi James and I should be flying out on the 26th of May.  I also hit up Homeplus and got some stuff I needed.  I need to get milk on the way home.  Something I forgot to mention was that on Saturday when I had to bring Gyeh-son back to get her comp, I saw the new guy going into the dorms with Chantel (sp?).  This being at like 1 in the morning and he leaves in Bang-chon.  Hook up?  Who knows.   Never a dull moment in Korea I guess.  I have no work tomorrow also.  I'm trying to think of what I should do.  I'm thinking day trip but it really depends on the weather.  There is some stuff I'd like to do in Korea while I have the time.  I'd like to make it to a few other cities just for the heck of it.  I still need to get to Jeju island  but I think that might happen after I get back.  Or maybe not.  If I don't got I'm sure I'll still  be able to live a happy life.  Ok I'm a little pooped so I'm going to call it a night and try to get some sleep.  Until next time.

      I'm in a mood.  Not a bad one, but not a good one either.  Just a mood.  Today was cool.  I saw Starskey and Hutch with Tim.  Really not a bad movie.  I found it funny and entertaining.  Much better then what I had expected.  We then ate some chicken friend rice with Hey-sook.  I'm begining to really this chick fried rice place but it doesn't have anything on WABA.  The weather sucked today.  I hate when it rains on Sundays.  We then hit up the board game cafe where I spent the rest of my afternoon and some of the evening.  Meika showed up and we played some A and A.  It was fun but not really fufilling.  We had to walk through the game and go slow as they both had never played that version.  It was cool, I'm just waiting for the next time when things are much more competative.  Oh Mieka and I lost buy the way.  Long explanation but it turned out Tim capitalized on a mistake and wouldn't let Mieka take something back.  No biggie.  There will be a next time. Yesterday was really cool in a lot of ways.  First I worked with Kevin and he hooked me up with the Cambodia and Vietnam Lonely Planet books.  What a great suprize.  Also, I only had 5 classes which kicked some ass.  Last night was great as well.  Dinner at WABA and then off for fun.  We ate and then went to the park behind Seattle's Best and had some vodka and cranberry juice.  Some girls that Gumi James met on the train here joined us.  They seemed but they had plans and had to split.  We then went to Bellagion where Caleb managed to almost pick a fight.  But I went and talk to the guys and smoothed things over.  From there we ended up at TC and then GR.  Both places were pretty cool.  I met a girl named Mi-gyung and GR who is really cool and speaks some great English.  But this always happens when you're taken and never when you're single, or so it seems.  Fenton headed home early b/c of a wedding.  Gumi James apprently really broke up with his girlfriend.  I'm sure exactly why but he's Gumi James so I'm not worried.  I ended up running Gyeh-son back to my place to pick up her computer and then she had to call it a night.  Jeff said he'd show up but never did.  Caleb said Helen was at GR and also said she'd put on a lot of weight.  I have to admit, this makes me happy a little bit.  There was some finger gaming but I actually didn't too bad this time round.  BB was hopping as usual after GR.  I made it home barely before the sun came up.  The sun comes up way to early now.  I hate getting home after sunrise.   It is good to be able to just sit and type.  I've been around people a whole lot lately and I need a little bit of alone time.  I also like this PC room I've found.  I think I'm going to make final flight plans tomorrow for my trip.   I will elaborate on my trip to the zoo b/c of Gabe's comments.  I tend to agree the conditions there seem sub par to say the least.  It has been a long time since I've been to a first rate zoo but I must confess I did feel the animals could have been treated better.   I think this is about all for now.

      I'm now in the capital of Vietnam and what an interesting place it is.  I had a long train ride to get here but at least it's over.  It really wasn't that bad but I'm not hurrying back anytime soon.  I've found a pretty killer hotel that had a promotion going on and I'm getting all kinds of goodies for really cheap (satellite tv, air-con, hot water a fridge etc.).  I have to make my way to the airport tonight to pick up Gyeh-son.  In theory this should be easy but I'm sure there will be some kind of bump in the road (b/c there always is).   I've spent the afternoon looking around the old quarter, which is where I'm staying, and it seems like quite a nice place.  I found several bookstores and the local tourist department store.  They have one really good bookstore the only problem is that the selection is full of almost all college textbooks.  Come on really, who comes here and wants to pick a $100 text book on accounting?  I guess a lot of people judging from the selection.  I'll see if I can't find a used bookstore or something along that line.   I got a decent amount of sleep last night I think.  I pretty much figured I'd get none but I managed to konk out for a bit.  I had a bunk and there was a ceiling fan so this made things tolerable.  There were a ton of people in my cart.  It was all moms that were bunking with their kids.  It looked like it would be a mess but they all went to sleep and got the hell off the bus pretty early so I was left all alone for most of the morning.  The icing on the cake was when a random kid was walking by my section and puked all over the place.  Just my luck huh?  Thankfully the other people hadn't left yet and they cleaned most of it up.  I can't believe the father (who was with the child at the time) didn't come back to clean it up or even apologize.   I'm looking forward to sleeping in the same place for 3 or 4 nights in a row.  I'm ready for things to slow down a bit for a few days.  I've got to figure out how I'm going to get to Loas.  I'll do this in the next few days.  I want to fly but this might not be possible as it might be a little pricey.   Nothing more to say.  Life is good.  Love to all.

      Today is a pretty chill day.  I don't have any real plans, just walking around the city and seeing what there is to see.  Too bad it's so hot.  But could be worse, I'm from GA so I'm used to the heat.  I have sleep accomidations in for my train ticket so this is good.  I also got a refund for my bus ticket to Hanoi that I won't use which was unexpected but much apprcaited.  I just wanted to cancel my reservation when the nice nice lady asked me if I wanted a refund.  How cool is that?   I've been walking around most of the morning checking out pagodas and museums.  Nothing too special but gives me something to do.  I'm also on the hunt for some books in English but haven't managed to find anything decent yet.   I think I might find my motor bike driver from yesterday and get him to haul me around until I need to leave tonight.   I feel great seeing as how I got to sleep in until 8:30 this morning.  That's pretty darn good for this trip actually.  I'm worried I'm going to end up with some tools in my "room" or whatever it is called on the train.  With my luck I figure I'll have someone who snores all night or smells bad or something.  But at least I have a bed.  Man I swear, if it's not yahoo messing up it's hotmail.  Why can't I access both of my accounts at once?  Ugh.   I'm looking forward to Hanoi and Northern Vietnam.  I could spend at least 2 months here just looking around and taking everything in.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking to travel around SE  Asia.   Time to find some food and then figure out what else to see and do this afternoon.  See ya'll in Hanoi.

      Ok if I wrote Webster's Dictionary (which I obviously don't b/c my name isn't Webster) and I was going to define inefficient I would put a picture of the Hue station and all the employees that worked there.  For those of you who live or lived in Korea you understand how chaotic it can be to wait in line.  Man this was like a demolition derby with people just piling around two windows trying to get tickets.  What I couldn't figure out is how the hell nothing ever seemed to get accomplished.  Really.  Nobody ever seemed to get tickets or answers or anything.  People just kept yelling and waving money, id's or whatever else they had.  After what seemed like forever I finally go helped after the guy who was waiting on me got fed up of waiting and started barking at them.  So to make a long story short I did get the train ticket I needed.   I leave at 6:45 tomorrow so I'll have most of the day to chill out.  I saw everything I had to see today.  I was going to take a tour of the DMZ (or where it used to be) but if I do that I'll be cutting it a little close.  I'm not really that pumped about it so I'll let it pass.  I've got to get some sleep.

      I've pretty much been touring like a maniac these past couple of days and I don't think it'll slow up for the next 2 days or so.  I tried blogging yesterday and had pretty much finished when the power to the whole place went out.  That sucked.  Apologies to Caleb as I was talking to him online when I was abruptly cut off. So I've arrived in the city of Hue now.  Nice enough place.  I waisted not time running around the city seeing the major sites.  Yesterday I went and saw some ancient Vietnamese Ruins just outside Hoi an.  I ended up not getting any clothes made but instead bought some t-shirts for about a buck each.   I was going to take the all night bus to Hanoi tomorrow but looks like that is full.  This puts a real kink in my plan seeing as how I want to be able to meet Gyeh-son at the airport when she arrives.  So I'll head to the train station and see what they have there.  While finding a hotel and all in easy enough I do worry about here seeing as how she is Korean.  I would equate a Korean not is Korea as something like a fish out of water.   Anyway I saw several ancient tombs today as well as a fortress.  Pretty interesting stuff.   I'm killer tired and hope to sleep well tonight.  I need it.  I'm not a morning person in the least but since I've been traveling and signing up for tours and having to catch buses I find myself up at least by 7 every morning.  That is a pretty scary thought.  I don't think I have much else to say now.  Maybe I do but I'm too tired to think of it.  Ok off to the train station.

      So as of today I've offically been away from Korea a month.  I can't say I really miss it that much.  There are things I miss though.  I miss the social aspects, the girlfriend and circel of friends.  And I miss knowing where everything is and having my own room night after night.  But it'll all be there when I get back (at least I hope so).  Today the bus ride I was worried about really wasn't all that bad.  I've gone crazy reading lately and read most of the way here.  I finished "What color is your parachute."  Great great book.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a job.  I also picked up a knock off copy of a Dhali Lama book called, shit I can't remember.  Anyway it deals with finding happiness and how he thinks this is possible and whatnot.  I'm not blown away by it but it's good.  It was co-written my a shrink and there is too much of him and not enough of the DL in my opinion.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  I have to say Vietnam is a stunningly beautiful country.  It really sunk in on the way here.  Everything is so green and vibrant.   The city I'm right now is rather small but seems quite nice.  I should be meeting some girls I met on the bus for drinks in like 30 minutes or so.  This will beat a Saturday night of sitting in my room.  I think I'll take a small tour tomorrow and then go shopping.  This place is famous for making clothes at cheap prices.  One lady quoted $25 for a custom made suit.  I'll have to look into that.   Yahoo is giving me problems with mail.  What a pain in the ass.

      So I've already designated the best dollar I ever spent (that was on the haircut in Saigon).  But the best $6 I ever spent might have been on my island tour today in Nha Trang.  Not only did we get to go around to 4 different islands but breakfast, lunch and an afternoon fruit buffet snack were included.  Too boot the food was great.  And when it could get better they broke out the floating bar.  It wasn't really a bar so to speak, just a little Vietnamese guy in a raft/tub thing pouring red wine for people while we floated around in our tubes.  It was pretty darn awesome.  My favorite part would be the snorkling at the first island.  I haven't been snorkling since Malaysia which was almost a year ago (but seems like yesterday).  Vietnam has some great coral reefs and marine life.  I love those really colorful fishies.  So now I'm back and chilling.  I don't know what I'll do tonight.  I'm tempted to go hang out and have a beer but I'm pretty tired and I have a killer 11 hour bus ride tomorrow.  That's gonna suck.   This trip is turning out to be all and more then what I could have imagined.  And I think I'm finally begining to get a hold on what I want to do with my life and finally getting the motivation to do it.  At least I hope.  Another month or so will tell for sure.  Ok I have to find somewhere to change money or an atm b/c I think I need to eat.

      Ok who just blogged his little heart out just to have the computer freeze and lose everything.  Yeah that would be me.  It figures.  I was all like "man stuff is so great I'm having such a good time, today was awesome."  Then just like that it all came to an end.  Oh well not the worst thing that could happen.  My day has been great and the trip keeps getting better and better so I can't complain.  I'm no in Nha Trang and it's a pretty hype place.  I'm seaside and loving it.  I cruised around on a motor bike this afternoon and check out the important sites.  So now that this is out of the way I can go island hopping tomorrow.   I wrote a lot more but you'll have to settle for this shorter version seeing as how I'm going to go home and get cleaned up.  Hope all is well with everyone.

      So the city I'm in is or was called "little Paris."  I can see why, as they do have a replica of the Eiffel tower near the post office.  And it definatly has a very French influence to it.  The city itself is great and I've had an awesome time here.  Today I hooked it up on a tour and managed to get around and see all the major sights.  The climate of the city is rather odd as it's really cool.  I had to break out the long pants and jacket.  It's a welcome change though.  There was the scare of rain this morning but it cleared up and all was well.  So I saw the summer palace of the king.  To be honest it really wasn't a "palace" so to speak.  More like a big house.  A big ugly house at that.  But it was explain that it was built in 1933 when Vietnam was really poor so it was pretty impressive then.  I also something called the crazy house.  And yes it was truely crazy.  I wish I could describe it but I can't.  It was the oddest building I think I've ever seen in my life.  If I had to associate with something it would be a big dead tree or something like that.  We also went around and saw lakes, waterfalls and valleys.  After the tour there was even enough time for me to zip over to the local museum.  Get this I even got my own private guided tour.  I don't think many people make it to the museum.  Only nerds like me.  It's a shame b/c it as quite interesting.   Tomorrow I'm off to the beach again.  I'll be going to the city of Nha Trang.  This should be fun.  I have to get up early but the bus ride is only about 4 hours.  Ok I think I'm going to track down some more food and maybe hit a cafe or something and chill.  Where does the time go?

      I now find myself in the city of Dalat.  I just arrived today and it's an awesome city with a lot of character.  It has a very Europeon feel to it.  I went to the beach yesterday in Mui Ne.  Fun but nothing really special.  They have some amazing sand dunes that I went and saw.  I again rented a bike and zipped around during the after noon and then played around in the South China Sea.   It looked like it was going to rain so I dipped into this here internet cafe but of course it didn't.  It started a little bit and I figured it wise to get out of the street.  Anywah I need to check my mail and stuff.  I'm not sure how long I'll stay here or what I'll do exactly tomorrow.  There seems to be a far bit as far as tours and whatnot go so I'll figure something out.   There seems to be so much to do in Vietnam.  At first time was dragging ass in Cambodia but it's really picked up ever since I was in HCMC and it's showing not signs of slowing down.  I have at least 2 more weeks left in Vietnam and then I'll go to Laos.  I think I might try and fly there if I can find a good deal.  I'm a little worried about running out of time.  There is still tons more I want to do.  Namely I really want to make it to Myanmar.  I'll need to fly in and out which shouldn't be a big deal.  But b/c of visa issues I'll have to wait until I get back to Thailand to fly.   Ok I haven't put up some quizzes in a long time so here goes.

      So like I said in my last post I went to go hunt for someone to cut my hair.  Well after a little bit of searching I found somewhere still open that looked more or less decent.  The going price was a buck.  I figured what the hell and rolled the dice.  Couldn't be much worse then Korean haircuts.  And come to find out it couldn't have turned out better.  For once I got the kind of cut I wanted and the guy didn't even speak English.  He showed me a book of pictures, I pointed to something that looked pretty good.  He then asked "same, same?"  I replied "same, same."  And the rest is history. So yesterday was a great deal of fun.  To start with I caught a tour and the first stop was some kind of vietnamese temple with a unique type of religion only found in Vietnam.  We got to see a ceremony and walk around the temple and stuff.  I'll just say it was interesting.  The temple is impossible to describe.  If I had to sum it up in two words it would be colorful and big. From there we went to the Chu Chi tunnels that he VC dug during the war.  Now this was just awesome in a really dirty sweaty way.  We got to crawl through the network of tunnels for over a 100 meters.  You don't realize how long a 100 meters is until you've crawled it through one of these itty bitty tunnels.  I'll be there first to admit I'd have made a terrible VC.  The whole structure was rather amazing.  I could never imagine living and fighting in these tunnels.  Scary stuff.  We also got to see some bomb craters still left over from B-52s.  Man those guys meant business b/c they left some big craters.   The people on my tour were all really cool.  We somehow ended up with a ton of Ausies.  I was the only American.   Once back and cleaned up I figured I needed to go out and see what Saigon had to offer as far as nightlife.  I didn't really have a plan.  Just figured I'd bounce around downtown meet some people who knew what was up and go from there.  Well I ended up finding exactly the people I needed at the place I was eating in my part of town.  I ended up hanging out with 2 Americans and an Ausie.  One of the Americans was tanked, the other was trying to get his mack on with a Latino girl that joined us so that left the Ausie and I go downtown and giver.  And giver we did.  I think he was in his 40's but I could have be wrong.  Anyway he'd been coming here for forever, spoke some serious Vietnamese and knew everything that needed to be known.  He gave me the downlow on how the mafia and the cops functioned, which bars were good and which to look out for.  We hit up the club of clubs in Saigon which is a place called "Apocalypse Now."  It was actually a pretty cool club.  Plenty of room and lots of people.  There were tons of bouncers there too.  We didn't hang out here too long.  Most of the girls here were working he said.  I believe it.  Same deal in Thailand.  As long as there are foriegners with money there will be girls trying to get it.  Then for the hell of it he took me to what he called "the seediest bar in town."  And I think he was right.  This place was more or less a brothel.  A little uncomfortable but an interesting experience none the less.  After this I called it a night.  It was really early, not even 1.  But I was so tired from the trip and needed some sleep.  Anyway we hit a some other nicer, normal bars before hand and Saigon seems to have a really cool nightlife.  I wish I could partake a little more in it before moving on. Today was pretty tame by my touring standards.  I got out and moving a little after 10.  I checked out Chinatown and the market there.  On my way there I had the most interesting ride on a motor bike ever.  I think I know what the guy in the Matrix 2 felt like while he sat on the back of the motorcycle while trinity drove againts traffic.  This was pretty much how my ride went.  This dude was either the best driver ever, or totally fucking nuts.  Either way I managed to make it there alive.  I think I was the only whitie there.  I also think not many whities make it there b/c nobody tried to speak to me or sale me anythings (rather odd I thought).  So I managed to wonder into the Chinese super mega hotel complex or something like that.  It was a badass shopping plaza where I came across an arcade that had several of my all time favorite video games.  After a few video games (which I did really well at) I moved on and checked out a temple/pagoda.  Then I zipped to the other side of town eat at Binh's soup shop.  Why go all that way just to eat noodles?  Well turns out this shop was the secret headquarters for the VC during the war.  Really it wasn't anything special and I was the only person there.  The guy also wanted 10,000 D for a coke (way too expensive).  I then walked around and checked out 2 more temples.  I think I'm offically templed out.  I've seen way too many and at this point unless there is some really awesome history or it's some fantastic work of art, I really just don't care.   I then spent the rest of the evening on a rooftop cafe planning out my next destination and writing in my journal.  Very relaxing.   All I can say is that Saigon has been a great experiance.  I'll be leaving tomorrow and I'm a bit sad.  Not sad really but I wish I could spend a little more time here and I wish I just had some people to kick it with and bumb around with for a few days.  But I'm on a schedule as Gyeh-son might actually fly in to meet me in Hanoi.  So I need to get my ass up there.  I'll be heading to the beach tomorrow and I have high expectations for that.  I'm not a huge beach person but I'll be a nice change from the noisy big city.  Speaking of noise you can't imagine how loud this city is.  People are always beeping their horns.   If all works out I should make it to Hanoi around the 1st of July.  This should give me time to do all the things I want to along the way.  Patrick out.

      The longer I'm here and the more I get out and around the more I really like this place.  People are much more with it than in Korea.  If I was to teach somewhere else I would seriously consider this place.  I don't know how it pays but everyone seems to want to speak English so it seems there would be a market.   Today was another killer busy day.  I'm been lucky as the heat and the weather haven't been too bad at all.   So I started with the fine arts museum.  And I have to say the art was pretty fine.  From there I rolled up to the zoo.  I love animals.  The conditions were much better then what I expected and I was also there on feeding day or lunchtime, I'm not sure which.  So I got to see lots of animals in action chowing down.  I even fed the elephant, for a price of course.  I think that is a stroke of genius by the zoo.  Get the customers to pay to feed the animals.  Gotta love it.  So I then hit the history museum.  Another good one I'll say.  Unfortunatly I got hit pretty hard by their fucking 2 and a half hour lunch break and had to kill 40 minutes waiting for them to open again.  It was right by the zoo so I just waited it out.  They had all kinds of cool stuff from around Vietnam and stuff they'd stolen from places like Cambodia.  Oh I almost forgot, a random woman asked to take a picture with me while in the zoo.  I was also followed around by a group of Vietnamese school girls.  One of them even worked up the courage to ask my name.  Man I love being tall and white in asia.  Seems it'll get you anywhere and everywhere.   So after the zoo I went and saw Ho Chi Minh's museum.  If you haven't figured it out yet there are a ton of museums in this city and I'm a real geek so I got to all of them.  This was in a really nice building but the museum itself wasn't all that.  Maybe "uncle Ho", as he is so affectionatly known, wasn't all that cool.  I'm not sure, but his museum wasn't that's for sure.  I then got some lunch and killed the afternoon in another shopping mall type place that I just happened across.  They had a great supermarket where I scored some chips ahoy and made really short work of them.  On the walk back I went into one of the Vietnamese traditional markets and bought a pair of fake Nike pants for $5.  They're really nice but the cut on the fit is a bit ghetto.  I might need to see if I can do something about it.  I'm debating on getting a Vietnam t-shirt.  I think I want one.  But if I buy one I can't wear it until after I leave the country.  I don't want to be the tourist who is wearing the t-shirt of the country he's in, that's pretty lame right?   So here I am chilling out.  I might try and get my hair cut tonight if I can find a decent place for a decent price.  I was close to getting a massage yesterday but I blinked at the last second.  It was cheap and I think legit but I'm not sure.  I also kept getting called into these pool bars.  They always had way too many girls with too much makeup on.  I'd like to play with fire but when I'm alone it's a little more scary.  It is just better to not get involved.  They also had a lot of super nice hair places downtown.  But all the "stylists" were really hot girls and there seemed to be a lot of extra room in the back.  I'm guess for naughty extra services.  I'm curious how much just a haircut would cost.   I think I'll go out tomorrow night regardless and sample the nightlife.  The lonely planet does good outlining the hotspots.  I'll try and get out early and get back before it gets too late.  I don't need to drink any more Vietnam beer either.  I had a 333 beer yesterday and it was pretty bad.  I wonder if you put two of them together would you get 666 beer?  And would it be all unholy and stuff like that?  Doubtful.  Probably just taste twice as bad. You want to know something scary?  I saw a Lotteria!  To think people other than Koreans will eat there is just mind blowing.  I ran the other way.   I should be going to see the VC tunnels tomorrow.  That should be pretty badass. Ok time to see if I can find a barber that knows what's up.

      Wow today was a full day.  I got up and moving early, ate some breakfast and made it to my first destination; the war remnants museum.  This was a pretty interesting place as it delt with the Vietnam War(or American War, depending on what side you were on).  The museum had a decidedly anti-American slant to it, go figure.  But regardless it did a good job of showing the horrors of war.  We pulled out all the stops trying to beat them.  Our chemical weapons and napalm did some terrible stuff to people.  We lost about 57,000 men and killed well over a million VC and yet they still managed to win.  I would call that beating the odds.  After that I wanted to go to the reunification palace but Vietnam has this really annoying habit where places shut down for like 2hrs for lunch.  That is crazy, a 2 hour lunch break.  Jeez, what a pain in the ass.  All kinds of places do it like museums and government buildings.  Anyway it wasn't that big a deal as there was plenty more to keep me occupied.  I then made my way over to Saigon's Notre Dame Cathedral.  Nice, but doesn't compare to the real thing.  I then hit up a state of the art shopping/entertainment center.  This was obviously where all the tourist with too much money came to remedy that problem.  It had a theater (but all the movies were dubbed in Vietnamese), a really upscale department store, bowling lanes, an arcade, a pc room, a hotel, all kinds of other assorted offices and a KFC.  Anyone remember Seaseme street?  The part where they ask "which one of these is not like the others?"  So of course I made a pit stop at KFC to grab lunch.  I supersized, but I have to say the size wasn't all that super.  But the sandwich was plenty good and I have to admit it was good to taste some western fast food.  I then rolled back to check out the palace.  It really isn't a palace, that's just a clever name, more like some kind of offical building of some sort.  Anyway I gave it walking throuh.  Damnit someone who has speakers on there comp (most have headphones) has had the same song on repeat for like the last 20 minutes and it's driving me nuts.   So next on the agenda was to mail some postcards.  Yes I'd already bought and written them during my lunch break.  I think the way the government makes most of it's money is through the postal system.  It's got to be.  Local mail is cheap, but if you want to send something international you better take out a loan.  So they have all these kids peddling postcards for dirt cheap but when you go to send them they gouge your eyes out.  Anyway it was painful so anyone that recieves a postcard you better appreciate it.   So postcards sent and now it's off to the HCMC museum.  Nice but nothing special.  Still on a crazy museum kick I rolled through the middle to town, which is really nice and found a rather small not often visited museum dedicated to HCM's successor.  I can't remember his name and I think only the Vietnamese know he existed.  The museum turned out to be really nice with air con and everything.  I also had a guy take me around and show me stuff.   So I walked around more after that.  It's probably 5 at this point.  It is really hard to describe how nice and modern and developed the city is.  I decided to eat dinner at the Hard Rock Saigon.  The only catch is there really isn't a Hard Rock Saigon.  The restaurant is a fake.  I knew this before heading there but I wanted to go just because.  It was pretty small and not nearly and glamorous.  Instead of great rock'n roll instruments, suites, records and whatnot they had some posters of 80's hair bands.  Almost as cool.   I did some more exploring after that and I think I found some sort of Korea town.  There were a handfull of Korean restaurants but that was about it.  I hit a bookstore and then went home.  Man I'm super tired.  Time to go hit the hay so I can giver tomorrow.  I have more to say but that is for another time when I can think.  Until that time, good night.

      That's for you Jess.  So I made it to Saigon or HCMC or whatever you want to call it.  I've found a nice place that more then suits my needs and now I'm free to blog away as I please.  Today was another killer full day.  My day started at 6:30 and hasn't ended yet.  So today was more boats and buses and whatever the hell else you needed to get around.  We hit a floating market, some type of rice factory, rice fields, rice this, rice that and more rice.  Apparently the south of Vietnam is an important producer of rice.  I met some really cool people on my tour who showed me around this part of town and pointed me in the direction of some decent hotels.  This is the backpacker/budget traveler area (which definatly includes me).  I'm really excited to be in the developed big city.  It just seems there is so much to do here which I'm just ready to eat up.  I have no idea what I'll do tomorrow but I'll try and figure it out tonight.  I think I'll just have a look around and see some museums and monuments and whatever else I can easily make it to.   This is a great computer lab.  I can now read everyone's pages and I have a web cam and mic that I'm using to talk with Gyeh-son.  This place is pretty giver.   Ok well I'm pretty worn out so I think I'll call it.  So far I've really enjoyed Vietnam and I hope it stays that way.

      I've managed to make to Vietnam without a snag so that's always a good start.  I arrived yesterday and signed up for two day river/bus tour that will land me in HCMC tomorrow.  Ok where to start.  First of all I already like Vietnam better then Cambodia.  At least this part of Vietnam.  It's not overrun with tourism so people are always trying to take your money and hassel you which is such a big relief.  Yesterday I stayed in a rather small town (can't remember how to spell the name) and had a pretty good time.  I think I ended up sleeping in a     hotel though.  Seemed nice enough at first.  But once I was in the room it occured to me the place was really dirty and run down.  I was only playing $3 so I guess I can't complain too much.  I didn't have to check in or give my name or anything.  I figured this out later too.  There were also a ton of       s in a case in the lobby.  Lucky for me I didn't hear any wierd noises.   On a really cool and interesting note, as I was walking around the city yesterday I walked past a basketball court where some Vietnamese kids were playing some ball.  And sure enough they saw the tall white guy walking by and asked me to join.  And join I did.  It was a ton of fun and my team ended up winning both games I played.  They about ran me to      .  I didn't do as much as I would have liked though.  B/c they were all pretty short there really wasn't much of an inside game going on b/c they had all learned to shoot so well.  On defense after blocking a few shots they all stayed the hell away.  Anyway it was really awesome and a great start to my excursion in Vietnam.   Today I went to my first Mosque.  We visited a minority village on the Me Kong river where they are all Muslim.  I ended up having a pretty full day of boat rides, bus rides, temples, floating villages, and all that jazz.  I'm pretty darn tired but the internet here is only 20 cents a minute so I'll hang out a bit longer.

      So as it stands I'll be taking a boat into Vietnam.  I'm really wanting to get to HCMC but if I don't see this part of the country first I probably won't ever see it.  There isn't much to tell about today as I only came back to Phnom Penh and I'm keeping it pretty low key since I have to get up early tomorrow.  Yesterday ended up working out well.  I had some great fish and chips after blogging and then the rain cleared up and I cruised all over the town.  It is pretty cool to actually know your way around town.  I hit 3 or 4 different beaches and got to watch a great sunset at the end of the day.  I started on the book GJ gave me (Rich Dad Poor Dad) and it's really good and an easy read.  I think I'll finish it on the boat tomorrow.   I'm looking forward to getting out of Cambodia.  I've enjoyed my time here a lot but it's time for a change.  People need to update more.  Caleb and Becky (what and odd combination) have been doing good jobs but what has happened to the rest of you guys?  Give me something to read at night.

      So I'm here at the beach but it's raining.  Really it isn't bad I just hope it clears up so I can zip around some more on the motto bike I rented.  It only cost $3 but still it's a lot of fun.  I spent the morning zooming around town, checking out different beaches and managed to locate the post office to drop my postcards off at.  But now that it's afternoon it seems the rain has come and hopefully not settled in for the day.   I stayed up last night watching the funeral for Regan.  Very moving I must say.  Then this morning when I woke it is was during the final good-bye in California.  I watched most of this as well.  I don't remember that much about him as I was only 10 when he left office but it was great to see so many leaders come together and honor him.   Ok looks like the rain is easing up a bit.  I think I'll grab some lunch and then get on my way.  I'll head back to Phnom Penh tomorrow and then I'll go to Vietnam on Monday.  I'm pretty much ready to get out of Cambodia.  Well I have a motto bike with a full tank of gas waiting on me.

      I managed to make it to the beach today after a rather wild night last night.  More on that in a minute.  I've made it to the seaside city of Sihanoukville and it's a pretty nice place.  I love it so far, very laid back and peaceful, just what I need at this point in time.  The place I'm staying seems nice an cozy and I look forward to a good night's sleep.   So I went out yesterday just with the idea to mingle, hit some happy hours and in general just break the monotony of always being in my room and asleep so early.  Mission successful to say the least.  I started by the river and wrote some postcards and then in my diary while I enjoyed some draft.  It was pretty tame as this is where all the older tourists hung out.  I was curious as to what else was around so I went to supposedly the best club in town.  Apparently it didn't pick up until later as nobody was in there.  So I walked down the street and landed in this bar called Shanghai.  I didn't know it until after I was in and seated at the bar that it was a hostess bar and all of the women were probably sex workers.  As luck would have it I sat next to this Danish guy named Ben.  He lives and works in Phnom Penh and seemed to know everything.  He was 35 and had been in Asia for a while.  He even lived in Busan for a bit.  His English was perfect and we started chatting.  He gave me the downlow on the local scene, what to do and what to aviod.  So we drank, talked to the girls and shot the shit.  At one point one of the hostesses wanted to go home with me and I had to politely decline.  I think this was an old dude hang out b/c I think I was the youngest guy in the bar.  So anyway he tells me about the Casino and how he is going there to meet his friends and that if you gamble you get free drinks.  So get this, he invites me a long and says he'll let me gamble with his money.  By this I mean anything I win would be his but it's a casino so it's not like we're going to win.  By now I've figured out this guy is a player.  I figure he'll let me play around with like $20 bucks.  Boy was I wrong he broke out $300 bucks, 2 for him 1 for me.  Shit.  Oh he had a really nice car with a driver as well.  So we're there drinking more free beer then we know what to do with and having a great time losing his money.  He's friends bailed or never showed or something, either way I never saw them.  I was doing really well for a while but then I go killed.  I finally had to call it and go home b/c I had to catch the bus this morning.  Fun, fun night.  I have to e-mail him and say thanks.   So I'm just being lazy today and doing nothing.  Tomorrow I think I'll get a bike and ride around and see what there is to see.  There are several beaches and I'd like to check them all out.  I'm not sure how long I'll stay here.  I was really wanting to get to Vietnam soon but I have to say I'm just loving the atmosphere here.

      In a day and a half I've pretty much exhausted all the sights to see in Phnom Penh.  This morning and picked up my Visa from the Vietnam embassy.  Looks like stuff got taken care of well enough.  I then went to check out the national museum.  This was actually better then I expected.  They had it set up well and plenty of statues and carving were on display.  From there I checked out two monuments and then a used bookstore.  I also swung by my neighborhood U.S. embassy just to see what it looked like.  The flag was at half mast, I'm guessing for Regan.  Anyway not much doing there.  I forgot to mention when I went to drop my passport off yesterday I asked the guard at the embassy where should I go to amend my visa.  He looked at my passport and I explained I wanted to enter the country earlier and I need the dates changed.  Being the nice guy that he was he offered to do it for me for $30 and wanted me to leave my passport with him.  Ok I'm smart enough to know I don't know everything but give me a break what kind of dumbass does he take me for?  Anyway I told him to screw himself (actually it was more of a polite no thank you).  Then the price magically went down to $20.  Still too much.  Regardless of the price I'm not leaving my passport with the bozo outside gaurding the place.  They were at lunch at the time and I had to come back but it ended up costing me only $10.  Man I really get sick of people trying to take me for all I'm worth.  I have a feeling when Cambodians look at me they only see dollar signs.  Something similar happened this morning as I was trying to arrange transportation.  The guy spoke English pretty well I'll give him that but he also wanted way too much money ($3).  Anyway I got someone for a buck.  I wonder if Vietnam will be any different, probably not. So I really don't have a lot to do right now.  I'm thinking about hanging out and waiting for happy hours to start.  There really isn't a whole lot to do in the city for tourists.  There are no shopping centers or movie theaters or anywhere to hang out and just chill at.  So I guess that is why I'm here blogging away.   These Cambodian computers are really fickle.  Some stuff works really well and other things are just a mess.  I can't respond to my yahoo e-mail on this computer for some reason but the connection is really good.  I guess it's give and take.   I should be going to the beach tomorrow to relax and chill out.  I think I'll hang out there for 2 nights then come back here and go over to Vietnam.  I can either take a boat or a bus.  Still haven't decided which yet.   I watch "Minority Report" yesterday night.  Good flick but not as good as I remembered it.  None the less it kept me entertained.  I think I'll try to venture out tonight.  There seem to be a lot of older travelers here and not so many people my age.  Or maybe I'm staying in the wrong place or something.  I couldn't resist the urge to buy more postcards.  Maybe I'll write them this afternoon.

      The dirty, dirty foriegner that I am.  Today was a nasty hot sweaty day.  Cambodia is officaly depressing and I'm pretty much ready to leave.  I managed to get to the Vietnamese embassy today and get my visa entry date changed to much earlier.  I don't know what I was thinking before but I must have been on crack or something b/c I had myself staying here until the 28th.  Forget that.  So the reason why I'm so down today is I took a double whammie of the killing fields followed by the genocide museum.  What a combination right?  Cambodian history is pretty horrible stuff.  Hitler didn't have much on these guys of the Khemer Rouge regime.  At the killing fields they have a stuppa filled with around 9,000 skulls and it has something like 17 levels.  The skulls are on the lower levels and they are all you can see.  Then you get to tour around and see the mass graves.  About 17,000 people were killed here.  The most morbid of everything there was the tree that they used to kill the babies with.  As it was explained, soldiers would hold a baby by the legs and swing him/her up against the tree.  Some were only 5 months old.  They would also play a game where they would throw the babies in the air and try to impale them on the bayonets of their guns.  Sick shit.  Of note is the fact that nobody was killed by gunshots.  Bullets were deemed too valuableso most of the deathes were a result of some sort of massive head trauma (i.e. hammer, sword, club, etc.).  From there I got dropped off at the genocide museum and this was as bad if not worse.  It used to be a highschool but was converted to a dention and interogation center.  Everyone who was killed in the killing field was once at the museum.  The type of torture that went on here is unimaginable.  There was as eerie silence over all the museum despite the fact that there were plenty of people there.  There is too much to say and there is tons I still just can't comprehend or digest. My day did end on a pretty good note as I went to the royal palace and check out the oldest temple in the city.  The royal palace was a nice break from the craziness of the city.  If you can imagine any major road in any city in America.  Then if you took all the cars and changed them to motor bikes and vise verca then you'd have a street in Cambodia.  Everyone has these little "motto bikes" and they all want to take you for a ride.  It is a cheap and fun way to get around but damn is it annoying to have everyone and their brother to ask you "motto bike sir?"   I love the cable tv in my room.  Last night I watched "Wallstreet" for the first time and it was pretty darn awesome.  Wonder what will be on tonight.   Oh I also went to the Russian market but there was nothing Russian about it.  No Russians, no signs, in Russian, no Russian products, nothing.  Just a clever name I guess.  Tomorrow I think I'll hit the national museum and some other monuments.  I think I might venture out on the town too.  I tried to find a place last night but didn't work out.  Guess it's closed or I got lost or something.  Enough for now.

      I arrived in Phnom Penh early this afternoon.  I have to say it is really good to be around some sort of development.  I haven't done a whole lot yet as I'm a little worn out.  I've opted instead to take it easy and relax.  I hope to get a good jump on things tomorrow morning.  I signed up for a tour but it looks like there aren't going to be enough people, as six are needed and I'm the only one signed up now.  No big deal, I'm more then cabable of making around by myself.  The ride over here was pretty smooth all things considered.  Of course my seat was the one right in front of the baby that wouldn't crying.  We also watched the worst copy of Entrapment dubbed in Cambodian ever.  It's a bad movie anyway, I didn't think it could get any worse.   I forgot to mention yesterday while I was out in the middle of the country side on top of this hill I met a girl from the suburbs of Atlanta.  World is a small place.  She was ethnicly Cambodian and was out to see the extended family.  She didn't seem too impressed with things. I ended up not going to the club last night as there seemed to be nobody in there.  There is a place nearby that Lonely planet says is pretty good so I might check it out just for a change.  I do miss being able to go out and experiance the nightlife.  But this should keep me out of trouble and from going broke too quickly. I ran into these fellow Americans on the bus over here and they're going to Myanmar (Burma).  This has really gotten me thinking about trying to go there.  Things have changed over the past year or so and they seem to be more welcoming to tourists.  I'd have to probably fly in and out which shouldn't be too big a problem if I can arrange it online.  If I went I'd probably go after Laos or when I went back to Thailand.  Right now I'm making pretty good time on my trip.  I have a hard time really relaxing as I'm pretty high strung trying to get around and see everything.  But in Cambodia is just doesn't make much sense to take a day off and sit around as there isn't that much to do.  Maybe that isn't the case here but I don't know.  I think I'll get my chill out time at the beach in a couple of days.  I wonder how far I can make it?  I had originally planned to make a loop and end up back in Bangkok and then head as far south as possible.  I think this will still be the case but I'd love the chance to deviate into Myanmar.  The connection on this computer isn't that great but the price is pretty hard to beat so I can't complain.  If anyone is board and has free time fly out to see me.  We can hook it up in Vietnam and giver.

      Yes my shoes are dirty.  It ended up pouring rain for a bit this afternoon.  Lucky for me I was pretty much done with all my sightseeing for the day and I was on the way back to the hotel.  I have a bit of mud on my pants too and that sucks.   I think I need to get out of Cambodia before I become depressed.  The longer I'm here the more details I find out about there war torn history.  Today, totally by chance, my motto driver turned out to be some kind of linguistic genius.  He speaks, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Russian and English.  So he could explain everything perfectly in English.  How this dude ended up driving around tourist like me, I'll never know.  So turns out this guy is 35 and was around during the civil war in Cambodia.  He and his family used to live in the capital but were relocated to Battambang.  Here his family was split up and he was put into a concentration camp.  At the time he had 10 siblings and both parents.  When everything finally ended he had lost 7 siblings and his father.  The details are just too bloody to get into but anyway it was a very moving story.  He was educated in Russian and Vietnamese but had to learn English on his own since that is what all the tourists speak.   One of our first stops was a place called the killing cave.  We've all heard of the killing fields and this is basically the same idea.  It was a deap cave with a hole at the top and the soldiers would throw you in and leave you to die.  There was a way to walk around into the cave from the other side so we went in.  In the event you didn't die from the fall there was someone waiting at the bottom to stab you with a bamboo spear.  Over 50,000 people were killed in this fashion.  There are still human bones left in the cave as a reminder.  It was a very humbling experiance to say the least.   After touring around I walked around town.  I'm planning on head to the capital, Phnom Pehn, tomorrow.  From my walk is seems I've made the right choice.  There really isn't much of interest here.  There is one local club I might dip into and have a beer just to see what's up.   I have to say the women here seem to be a lot more attractive than the ones in Siem Reap.  There also aren't nearly as many beggers.  Should be only 6 hours tomorrow so that shouldn't be too bad.  Stay tuned.

      So I guess my last post did take huh?  Oh well I couldn't see it the other day when I did post.   Anyway, I'm out of Siem Reap and in Battambang.  This is the second largest city in Cambodia but there really isn't a whole hell of a lot here.  Yesterday I went all over the place seeing several remote temples in Siem Reap.  This stuff still blows my mind.  I think it borders on impossible to see all the temples (some of which aren't worth seeing) so I tried to see the biggest and best and I think I succeded.  Last night I went and hung out at a local bar/restuarant and finished writing postcards and updated my journal.  It was really relaxing as I got to sit on the third floor balchony, enjoy two for one cocktails and watch the sunset.  Speaking of postcards I think I'm going to post myself into bankruptcy.  I wrote 24 postcards from Angkor.  And if you're not getting one it's b/c you didn't give me your address.  So give me your address then.  Anyway I hope they all make it home.  I'll actually send them out tomorrow and I'm kind of scared how much it will cost.  I think I might have to ease off on the postcard writing to make sure I can still stay in budget and eat.   So today I woke around 5:20 to catch the van at 5:30 to the boat that came here.  Today has been a really long and very humbling day.  It was long in the fact that I was killer tired and stuck on a pretty crappy boat all day going really slow.  It was humbling in that I think I saw the worst poverty I've ever seen in my life.  All day along the river we'd pass these communities (if you can call them that) composed of nothing more then simple building put together with reeds and bamboo.  The river we went down was absolutly filthy.  People just throw there trash and relieve themselves in it.  On the other side they also bathe clean their dishes and swim in it.  This was an eye opening experiance to say the least.  I hope I never have to live like that.   On the brighter side I think I'll have a pretty full day of touring tomorrow.  There isn't a whole lot in the city but there is stuff to do around it so I'll have to hire a guy to drive me around for like $5.  I think I'll stay two nights here and then move onto the capital Phnom Pehn.   Traveling alone has its ups and downs.  During the day it's great; I get to do whatever I want for as long as I want to.  I can also move or stay or do whatever.  But at nights it gets a little lonely.  I'm too cautious to go out the clubs and get drunk or stay out late.  A drunk white guy out late is just asking to me mugged.  I do miss the nightlife.  But lucky for me most of these guesthouses have cable tv with several movie channels so that helps.  I also have some books I should probably be reading.  Ok think that's all for now.

      So today was my second day looking around Cambodia.  It was up and down but ended on an up.  So I'm peddling out to the middle of nowhere to see some temples.  First it is hard as fuck to find these temples for some reason.  The maps are all fucked up and there is construction going on so you don't know which road is which.  Anyway I've pretty much given up and I'm going to go back to somewhere that I can find when my bike throws the chain.  For those of you who don't get it, it means it broke.  Well shit I'm way the hell out with a broken bike.  Luckly I didn't have time to get too mad as some kind drove by me hauling a perfect trailer to put my bike it.  Of course he is the one kid in Cambodia who can't speak a lick of English.  But it's good b/c someone else helps us figure it out.  I pay him $2 to haul me back to town to get a my money back for the bike.  $2 bucks is a fortune by the way.  He would have probably taken fifty cents if I'd tried.  But I didn't have the time or the inclination to argue.  So I get back and get my money back for the bike.  At this point I hail a guy and pay him $4 to drive me around for the rest of the day on his motor scooter.  This is the way to go.  I think he would have taken less too but again I just wanted to get the show on the road.  Anyway we got on our way and the rest is history.  I think I'll have someone drive me around tomorrow.  These guys will drive you around all day for $5.  That's crazy.   You know for Cambodia this computer is pretty good.  I'm not sure what I was expecting but it's fast and seems to get the job done.   Thanks for the advice Becky.  Everyone I meet is trying to sell me something.  I'm getting ruder by the day.  People just come up and try to start conversations with you in order to feed you something.  I couldn't care less now.  If I have another person offer me a cold drink I think I'll scream.   I will say this I don't mind parting with my money so much in Cambodia when it comes to people who really need it.  I've gotten what I believe to be a pretty good idea of what shit should cost and I don't mind paying what would be considered a fair price.  I think this is b/c I see how these people have to live and work.  So when I have to pay a dollar or two to eat it's not big deal.  This is a lot of money in Cambodia by the way. Becky where are those hot girls you were talking about in you blog when you were here?  I haven't seen that many.  Granted I've been out and about in Angkor and all the women I met are sweaty and trying to sell shit.  I might dip into a local bar tomorrow and see what's going on.  The last day of my pass is tomorrow and then I'll spend Sunday looking around the town.  I think I'll split out of here on Monday.

      Well I made it to Cambodia.  It was a long bumpy ride but I'm here and seem to be staying at a pretty nice place.  Cambodia is a very poor country to say the least.  Being here only a day has made me appreciate what I have so much more.  It is really distrubing to see how some of these people have to live.  I wonder how the rest of the country will be?  I'm not sure how much time I'll end up spending here (in Cambodia) that is but I think I'll be like 2 weeks and then I'll move over to Vietnam.   So I went to Angkor today.  I have to say it is some of the most impressive stuff I've ever seen in my life.  To think that people actually build those temples is just amazing.  I think I've walked and riden more today then I ever have in my life.  I should sleep well tonight.  The restuarant in my hotel/guest house is really good and pretty cheap by my standards.  Stuff costs between one and two dollars.  You have to know that this is a ton here in Cambodia.  But it's so easy and convenient.  Angkor Wat is a great work out.  It's like a jungle gym but with ancient ruins in the jungles of Cambodia.  You can climb all over the ruins and up them and it's just great.   One thing is for sure, whatever we're doing to teach kids English in Korea just isn't working.  Everyone from infants to grandads speak English.  And I'm not talking like "hello" English I'm talking about really good conversational English.  But I guess that is how they make their living and it's what they have to know.   Today I had a little Cambodian kid named Spiderman watch my bike for me while I roamed around Angkor Wat.  When I came back I bought him a coke and then bought some of his postcards.  Get this, he wanted to sell me more postcards then I could use.  This is saying a lot since I'm pretty much a postcard nut.  I think I sent out 20 from Bangkok.  So I picked up 2 packs of 10 from him.  This should last me plenty.   I've got a three day pass so I'll go back tomorrow and check some more stuff out.  You just can't understand how massive the complex is.  I think I'll hang out here three more days and then I'll roll on to my next spot, where ever that may be.

      Yeah so last night before going to bed I went to brush my teeth but as I attempted to do this I realized there was no toothpaste.  The only reasonable conclusion is that Gumi James took the toothpaste.  Never trust and Englishman around toothpaste.  There is another possible scenario however.  What if someone broke into my room and only stole the toothpaste without touching anything the else.  Possible, but not probable.   Today I'm taking care of stuff that needs to be taken care of.  I mailed out postcards, went shopping and did laundry.  Nothing major.  I think I'll walk over and see one tourist sight, maybe two.  I need to get a good nights sleep tonight as I'll want to leave for Cambodia tomorrow.  I picked up another lock for my bag just I can lock down absolutly everything, also some sun screen and of course more toothpaste.   I loved my time here in Bangkok but it's now time to get up and move on.  They are cleaning my room now so I'm using this chance to blog a bit.  I want to drop off the stuff I bought then I'll go out for a long walk and see what I can see.  I wonder how long the bus ride to Cambodia is?  Guess I'll find out soon.  I should get my passport back all the visas in it so I'm pretty excited to be on my way.  I think after all my running around is done I'll just hang out in Starbucks and read or write or something like that.

      So I fly to Myanmar tomorrow morning at 10:15am.&nbsp; Now that is cool.&nbsp; I've blogged a lot in the past two days but that might be coming to an end.&nbsp; I think I won't be able to blog for the duration of my stay there.&nbsp; I could be wrong but given their current policy on e-mail I doubt it.&nbsp; I've managed to collect everything I need to go and I'm totally ready.&nbsp;  I slept like&nbsp; log last night but I need another good night's sleep.&nbsp; I should probably be asleep already but here I am instead.&nbsp; I didn't get to watch a movie today but I did go to another museum.&nbsp; I've pretty exhausted all of them in Bangkok with the exception of one.&nbsp; I guess I'll save it for when I come back or something.&nbsp;  I hope to be able to write on the other side but in case I&nbsp;can't fairwell for 2 weeks (actually 16 days not counting tomorrow).&nbsp;

      Fuck, I just finished typing a up a nice entry and the only thing that published was the title.&nbsp; I'm gonna play some games and blog later.   &nbsp; Ok I feel a little better now.&nbsp; I just played some counter-strike for the first time in a long time and it felt good.&nbsp; Basically all you do is run around an shoot people.&nbsp; Very relaxing.&nbsp;  Ok I won't go into detial as much but I had the ride of my life yesterday, literally.&nbsp; I wanted to go watch a movie but there was too much traffic (rush hour).&nbsp; So all the cabbies kept telling me to get a motor bike driver.&nbsp; So finally I negotiated a price and off we went.&nbsp; Man I had no clue what I'd gotten myself into.&nbsp; So there is rush hour traffic and here we are on a bike.&nbsp; I guess in Bangkok bikes are allowed to lane split (that or they just do it anyway).&nbsp; This wouldn't be such a big deal if you were doing it at a safe decent speed.&nbsp; Of course this dude is just racing along like mad.&nbsp; Weaving in and out of traffic the whole time doing like 50 mph.&nbsp; Now I had another notable ride in HCMC but this one blew it away.&nbsp; As exciting as this was I have to say it wasn't exactly safe and in hindsight might have been stupid on my part.&nbsp; But to his defense he did get me there in one piece and quickly.&nbsp; I'll never ride like that again.&nbsp; It was like a rollarcoaster except that you didn't know you were going to get off in one piece.&nbsp; But no harm done.&nbsp; Saw "I, Robot".&nbsp; Good flick. So go my visa to Myanmar and I'm off to book tickets now.&nbsp; Might catch anohter movie but I don't know.

      If all goes as planned I should be able to visit Myanmar next week.&nbsp; I'm currently like a 2 minute walk from the embassy and ready to get a visa.&nbsp; I've been waiting out there lunch hour and I'll finish up my hour which only costs 20 baht (50 cents).&nbsp; This is a great price and I have all kinds of cool games to play too.&nbsp; It's amazing what happens when you get out of the touristy areas.&nbsp; Gabe by the time I'm done with this trip you'll have such a good idea of the pricing startegy in this part of the world you'll never get ripped off. I managed to get a little sleep but not much.&nbsp; I'm not too tired and I'll just rough it out for the rest of the day.&nbsp; I think I'll take the river taxi back, book my ticket and then hit a movie.&nbsp;  I always seem to hit Bangkok at awkward times.&nbsp; I wish I could just go and get my visa done but of course it takes two working days and Saturday and Sunday aren't working days so that'll set me back two days.&nbsp; This happened last time when I was getting visas, what a pain.&nbsp; But I'll make the best of it.&nbsp; There are several day tours I can take and I might even leave town for a few days and come back when my visa is ready.&nbsp;  I had Micky D's for lunch and it was awesome.&nbsp; Unfortunatly it really doesn't fill you up all that much when you're killer hungry.&nbsp; I'll have to grab some food after the visa run.&nbsp;  I spent the monring shopping around for the best price on visas and tickets.&nbsp; The visa is simple enough to do by myself (or so it seems), it's a ton cheaper and the tickets I can get for about $150 round trip.&nbsp; This is better than I thought.&nbsp; I hope to spend at least 2 weeks or so there.&nbsp; Judging from the book there are about 5 cities I'd like to visit.&nbsp; This would cap off an awesome trip in a great way.&nbsp;  I wonder what's playing at the theater?&nbsp; It's so good to have a day to just chill out and relax a bit.&nbsp; Even though I guess I've really been doing stuff most of the time it hasn't been all touristy and whatnot.&nbsp;  Ok time to see if they'll give me a visa.

      I've made it back to Bangkok and I have to say it feels good.&nbsp; It is currently 5:36 in the morning and I'm killing time until I can find somewhere to check in.&nbsp; The bus ride here was long but the bus was nice and the ride wasn't too bad.&nbsp; I'm killer tired seeing as how I didn't get crap for sleep on the bus.&nbsp; I think this place closes in a little bit, at least that's what the dude said and he'd probably know.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; Hell it's about time people started getting up.&nbsp; Who knows? The other parts of Laos I went to didn't turn out to be too interesting so in the interest of ime I came back here to get a move on things.&nbsp; I'll figure out tomorrow if I'm going to go to Myanmar or not.&nbsp; After that I'll go to the super duper shopping center and catch a movie or two and relax.&nbsp; I know it plays into Western stereotypes but I'm hard up for come Micky D's and I hope to take care of that tomorrow as well (I guess it's really more like later today).&nbsp;  I hit the cities Tha Khaek and Savannahket but neither of them had much to offer a tourist like myselft.&nbsp; I hopped a little fiery over the Mekong and came back to Thailand.&nbsp; It's amazing, just like that I'm back in a country so much more developed than the one I just left.&nbsp; Another reason I came back is that Laos banks have a nasty habbit of only changing traveler's checks for Kip (local Laos currency).&nbsp; This wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that nobody will change Kip for anything else.&nbsp; Not wanting to be stuck with a ton of useless dough I opted to bolt.&nbsp; This did prove to a little interesting given my financial situation.&nbsp; I didn't have a lot of Kip left so that's why I wanted to leave.&nbsp; So I got to the dock, looked at the boat fee and then went to eat some food.&nbsp; I came back and hit immigration.&nbsp; Nobody told me but you have to pay a buck to leave the country.&nbsp; Not a big deal.&nbsp; Then turns out once you get to the other side you have to pay another dollar for the "port fee."&nbsp; After all my fees and shit were paid it left me with exactly 40 cents to my name, this being in Kip of course which is totally worthless on the other side.&nbsp; But no big deal.&nbsp; I strolled down the street hit the bank and cashed traveler's check with 30 minutes to spare.&nbsp; I'm lucky I made it really.&nbsp; I'd been budgeting for the past 2 days or so. I loved Laos though.&nbsp; The South was truelly Laos.&nbsp; I only saw one other foriegner and he was at the bus station.&nbsp; Much the same in Savannaket.&nbsp; I guess there are reasons why tourist don't go there huh?&nbsp; Anyway it was fun to see none the less (just not exciting).&nbsp;  If for some reason I can't go to Myanmar then I'll roam around Thailand for a bit.&nbsp; There are tons of places I need to see and I won't have time for if fly off to Myanmar.&nbsp;  I've started reading "Patriot Games" by Tom Clancy and it's pretty darn good.&nbsp; I liked "Hunt for Red October" and I don't really know why I haven't read anything else of his.&nbsp;  He's closing, got to go.

      Just when you think things can't get better, some how they do.&nbsp; At least that is the case in a very small way right now.&nbsp; I thought I'd found the best deal in town for the internet and as fate would have it I've found a better rate with computers and speed that are just as good.&nbsp; The first place was about a dollar an hour and this one is sixty cents.&nbsp; I know it's nothing to go crazy over but I'm pleasently surprized. So my visa finishes on the 22nd.&nbsp; I don't have much time left here but I'm going to try and go to at least one more city and then hop back over to Thailand.&nbsp; I'm going to catch a bus tomorrow (not another bus) going south.&nbsp; I might visit two cities, I'm not really sure.&nbsp; I've thought about heading back to Thailand from here but it just doesn't feel right.&nbsp; I feel I should see a bit more before leaving.&nbsp; I've had a great time here thus far and I'm curious to see what the Southern part is like, if only for a little bit.&nbsp;  Braves are tied for first, oh yeah. Today has been very productive and relaxing.&nbsp; Got everything squared away with Gyeh-son leaving.&nbsp; Bought here ticket and all that.&nbsp; We went to the market where she bought postcards to give to her friends and then I couldn't resist buying more to send home.&nbsp; We had a fruit shake at the best fruit shake stand in the world.&nbsp; No really, this place is awesome.&nbsp; For 40 cents you get a huge ass fruit shake and it's just awesome.&nbsp; We got some food and then relaxed.&nbsp;  Things I still need to do are, I've got to buy a new book, buy a Beer Laos t-shirt, and maybe get a haircut depending on how much it costs.&nbsp; Oh I have to pick my laundry up to.&nbsp; It's so nice to have clean clothes.&nbsp;

      Seems like I've spent a lot of time on buses lately.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in fact I think I have.&nbsp; Getting to Phonsavan was interesting.&nbsp; So we left Luang Prabang bright and early on the public bus (there was no other way).&nbsp; All seemed to be going really rather well.&nbsp; We were making good time, not stopping too much etc.&nbsp; Then as fate would have it a tire blew out.&nbsp; Ok no biggie I needed to go to the bathroom anyway and these dudes had obviously seen it before and were all over it.&nbsp; Maybe we lost 20 minutes.&nbsp; So then all is going well again, I finished my book, enjoying the scenery and "blam", another tire goes out.&nbsp; It might have been the same tire actually.&nbsp; I needed to go to the bathroom again so it wasn't a total waist.&nbsp; This time seemed to take a little long.&nbsp; At this point we're pretty close to town.&nbsp; So we get going again.&nbsp; We're 3KM from town for a third time a tire goes out.&nbsp; What luck?&nbsp; Well this time we're fucked b/c for whatever reason they can't fix it or it's going to take forever.&nbsp; So they radio into town and have some little "took tooks" come and pick us up.&nbsp; So at last we made it.  We found a good guesthouse and got some food and that's about all.&nbsp; It's hard as hell to sleep on these buses b/c you're always going up and down mountains so you're constantly moving from side to side and being slid out of your seat.&nbsp;  Phonsavan is nothing special in and of itself.&nbsp; It's a pretty small town with not much going on.&nbsp; But the plain of jars is pretty darn awesome.&nbsp; I explained most of it in the previous post&nbsp;but I'll go over it again.&nbsp; So there are three major sites that you can visit.&nbsp; Site 1 was probably the best as it had 350 huge ass cement jars scattered all over the place.&nbsp; The largest one weighed around 15 tons.&nbsp; The best part is nobody knows what the heck they are for.&nbsp; It reminded me of stonehenge a bit in that they were really old and mysterious.&nbsp; They are around 2500 years old by the way.&nbsp; We then proceeded to sites 2 and 3.&nbsp; I guess they are all more of less the same with slight differences in size and number of jars.&nbsp; It's just really odd that someone (or some group of people)&nbsp;made all these jars and just left them lying around and nobody can seem to make heads or tails of it.&nbsp;  Yesterday night I had the best Indian food I think I've ever had.&nbsp; There always seems to be an Indian restaurant around no matter where you are and in Laos they are cheap and really good.&nbsp; We also had a few bottles of Beer Laos which made things taste all the better.&nbsp;  Today was another really long bus ride.&nbsp; I think I just get really frustrated with the fact that it takes so long to go such short distances.&nbsp; This is mostly due to the fact that you're in and out of mountains most of the time.&nbsp; But the buses are old and everything just seems to take forever.&nbsp; Laos people are never in a hurry it seems.&nbsp; Neither am I really but it would help to get places a little bit faster.&nbsp; I would like to visit a few more cities in Laos&nbsp; but time is against me I think.&nbsp; Scott needs to get back to me and tell me when I'm need back in the ROK.&nbsp; We'll see how things go.&nbsp; Gyeh-son flies out on Wednesday so then I'll be all by my lonesome again.&nbsp; I need to figure stuff out by then.&nbsp;

      So we woke up ass early today to hit up our all day tour.  The tour started with a ride up river to see some caves.  These caves weren't a whole lot compared to the ones we saw in Vang Vieng so I wasn't too impressed.  The boat ride was nice though.  We also stopped at some small villages to do some shopping.  I tried probably some of the strongest alcohol I've ever had.  This stuff was 55%.  I can't say it tasted bad b/c you really couldn't feel anything as soon as it was in your mouth.   We had a lunch break and after lunch we took a bus ride to see a waterfall.  This was a pretty awesome waterfall.  We hiked all the way up to the top and got to look down and see the whole thing from above.  The day wore me out pretty good.  I plan to sleep well.   I like Luang Prabang but I don't think it's as great as people have made it out to be.  For some reason I think I like Vientiane better.  There are plenty who would call me crazy but that's just how I feel. Tomorrow is going to be a long bus ride.  We are going from here to Phonsavon.  This is where the plain of jars is located.  The plain of jars is just that, a plain with a whole bunch of stone jars scattered about.  What mades it interesting is that nobody knows why these jars were built and why there are so many.  They are also massive by the way.   I've also managed to catch up on people's blogs today.  Asma where was your passport anyway?  Becky I wish you were there too.  You're welcome for the postcard Michelle.  Glad you made it back safely Mieka.  Caleb I hope all is well in love and whatever the heck else is going on.  Gabe you need to blog dude.   Atlanta Braves baseball is looking up.  They are only one game out of first place now. I'll talk a little more about Laos since I'm waiting on Gyeh-son.  She is a Korean at a computer so it might be a while.  On thing great about Luang Prabang is they have some killer bakeries.  I had a cinnamin roll today and some cookies yesterday.  I also love how cheap it is to send postcards.  The postcards are also really good quality.  The beer is a good too.  It better be since the only beer you can buy is Beer Laos.  I like it so much I might buy a t-shirt of it if I can find it at the right price.  I think the Loas people have really gotten their act together in on the tourist side of things.  The Lonely Planet I'm using isn't that old but already they've hiked the prices in Laos up pretty steaply.  She's done, gotta go and not time for spell check.

      Long time no blog.  This won't be too long I think since it's rather expensive by Laos standards to use the Internet.  Anyway I booked a tour at this cafe and we get 15 free minutes so I'll use it wisely, or at least try to.   I have to say I'm enjoying Loas much more than I thought I would.  I thought it would be along the lines of Cambodia and I was totally wrong.  Since my last blog Gyeh-son and I went rafting down a river in Vang Vieng and spelunking (sp?) as well.  This was pretty darn awesome.  The caves we checked out were amazing.  While rafting, really I guess it was kayaking we tipped over 3 times.  I blame it mostly on her.  But no biggie.  She only lost a sandal.  The weather was overcast and had been raining so the river was faster and rougher than normal so we really got our money's worth.  After this little outing I'm convinced Laos is the most beautiful place in the world.   Today was our first full day in Luang Prabang.  This is a nice, cozy little town of much French influence.  We walked around and gave ourselves a tour of the town and temples.  Tomorrow we'll be off to visit some more caves and waterfalls around the area.  Time is flying and I'm running out of it real fast.   I got an e-mail from the guy I work for and I'm going to have to make plans to come back.  If I'm lucky I can probably squeeze 3 more weeks out.

      It turns out the French messed up when they decided to make an offical spelling for Laos.  For some reason they added an "s" to the end.  Turns out the "s" is silant and the name of the country should be pronounced as Lao.  French always messing stuff up. I'm not in Vietiane and it's a nice change from Hanoi.  Despite the fact that this is the capital it has only around 140,000 people and it's a very peaceful and quiet place.  There isn't that much to see or do it's just good to be able to relax and take it easy.  Our place is right by the river so we can look out and see Thailand while eating breakfast.   The bus ride here was long as hell.  It clocked in total at around 25.5 hours.  This road trip was one for the ages.  First the bus was around an hour and half late picking us up and nobody knew why.  This left my little group of 9 tourists sitting on the side of the road outside a brothel waiting for what seemed like forever while the dude who was "in charge" frantically dialing away on his cell phone trying to figure out what was going on.  Ok but no big deal, we finally go picked up.  We were told the trip is between 20 and 22 hours.  Not good but could be worse.  We get on and there are a fair amount of tourist on the bus and come to find out they've been driving around for like 2 hours and can't believe they are still in Hanoi.  So then we go to pick up the locals.  They were either Laos or Vietnamese I'm not sure and this is where stuff gets a bit interesting.  Oh I forgot, we were promised a/c on the bus but turns out that came in the form of open windows.  You're always promised a/c on buses in SE Asia but it someone always seems to be "broken."  So the locals pile on, and I do mean pile on.  I don't know what the hell they were bring with them but it was more luggage and goods then I'd seen before.  So now all the seats as well as most of the isle is filled with people or luggage.  The trip really wouldn't have been that bad but what made it terrible were all the frequent stops during the night.  Come to find out it's not only a bus for getting people to Loas but it also transports anything and everything between the Hanoi and Vietiane.  So pretty much nobody had a shower since the morning since you have to check out of your hotel by 11 or 12 so I know I was smelling nice come the next morning.  Probably the most interesting thing about the bus were the Christmas lights used to light the interior.  This was just odd.  The rest is just too much work to go into but eventually we made it and even found a decent place to stay.  If there was one good aspect about it, it was being able to see the Laos country side.  Laos might replace Vietnam for the most visually stunning place I've been to.  Impossible to describe but it was just amazing.    So now that we're here what have we done.  Yesterday and today weren't that crazy.  Stuff is really laid back and relaxing.  We had some great fruit shakes.  Today we rented a motor bike and took a road trip to Buddha Park which had some of the strangest statues I've ever seen.  Yesterday was spent on a walking tour. The city is nice and I'm enjoying it a lot more then I thought I would. Stuff here is a little more expnesive then I thought it would be.  They are pretty smart and keep prices consistant across the board so you can't find stuff for super cheap. At least I haven't yet. Being the nerd that I'm annoyed at how expensive postcards are.  It's five for a $1.  In Vietnam I could get 200 for around 80 cents.   Ok tomorrow we're catching a bus to somewhere that I can't spell.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Not going to bother with spell check.

      I have to say I think Halong Bay is possibly the most beautiful place I've ever been.  I seriously hope everyone gets a chance to see this place before they day.  It really is absolutely amazing.  We spent the night on one of the islands there and then cruised around some more today and came back.  I've been pretty drained lately and I hope to rest well tonight.  I didn't do much last night except hit the sack.  In case you didn't know Halong Bay is located in the Gulf of Tonkin and has some 3,000 plus rock islands along with numerous caves to boot.  We got to go into 2 huge caves also.   We were going to head to Laos tonight but the bus is full.  Always something messing up.  It's actually quite alright with me.  I'd like another night in a bed and be able to hang around tomorrow and finish up some last little sightseeing.  The bus takes around 24 hours to get there.  Man I'm not looking forward to that.  I need to pick up a new book.  I finished my Dhali Lama book "the art of happiness."  It was an interesting read.  The DL is a pretty smart guy and seems to really relate well to people.  I'll hit the book store tonight or tomorrow I guess.   It's funny I look back to the beginning of my journey and I can see how much I've learned in just a little over a month.  I could have saved so much money if I'd only known then what I know now.  When I say so much money I mean like $30 or $40.  Not really a great deal but for this part of the world it's a nice sum.  I feel so much more travel savvy now and I'm much more able to play the game so to speak.  Anyway you live you learn.  It's not that I waisted money but I could have done without stuff and probably found stuff cheaper if I'd tried.  I remember how nervous I was when I first started and now it's no big deal to hop around from city to city or country to country.   I need to figure out when I'm needed back in Korea.  I really want to make it to Myanmar so I think I won't spend a ton of time in Laos.  There really doesn't seem to be that much there.  I currently have 4 cities slated on the schedule and if I need more time then I can take it.   I'd have to say they thing I miss the most is being able to watch movies.  Man this is killing me.  I really want to hit a theater and just check out the summer blockbusters.  This gives me something to look forward to when I go back to Thailand.  They are big Hollywood movie fans.  Ok I need to scare up some food here pretty soon.  Bus leaves at 7:30 tomorrow so I'll probably be able to update one more time.  Same Bat time, Same bat channel.

      So day is a day or R&R.  No real plans.  Just walking around to travel cafes trying to figure out which tour we want to take for tomorrow.  There are two places I'd like to go and see.  But one of them has a pretty hefty price tag on it.  It's not really expensive but for travelers on a budget it's a nice sum of money.  I think we'll go to Halong bay tomorrow (the cheaper of the 2).  This is a bay with some 3000 islands in it and is supposed to be stunningly beautiful.  I've been hunting around for bargains but it's all basically the same.  They have a 2 day 1 night that looks pretty appealing.   I picked up my glasses today and they seem to be just what I wanted.  I'm not so sure about the frames but they were cheap and that's what counts.  I also went and mailed a ton of postcards off.  After that I hit up the local tourist department store and picked up some deodorant.  I know this doesn't sound so important but as anyone who has lived in Korea knows you can't buy it in Korea.  Or maybe you can but it's really hard to come by.  Either way I seized the opportunity.  No plans now.  I'll check out the Lonely Planet and see what else there is to do.  But I feel I've done the things I want to do most and it's about time to move on.  I do love my hotel and the free breakfast that I get in the morning.  That is some really good stuff.   I'll tell you one thing I won't miss about Vietnam is sweating like a pig.  Man I don't know what it is but I must have never walked around so much in the heat before in my life.   Last night was pretty tame as Gyeh-son was pretty pooped.  I think all the walking, touring and heat has taken it's toll on her little Korean self.  So we just got some food and then a beer and went back.  I wanted to go to a club but not enough to go by myself.  Maybe another time.   I pretty much hate yahoo mail.  They are so annoyingly unreliable.  I've been trying to access my e-mail for the last 30 minutes.  What's worst is that I can see other people checking their yahoo mail.  Fudge.  I think I'll sign up for google's mail service.   I really want to see Spiderman 2.

      So this morning I tried for the third time to go to the Army museum.  The first day I was kind of short on money and didn't want to blow my last little bit on the museum.  Yesterday it was closed b/c from some reason it's closed on Friday and Monday.  And today the electricity was off.  I think I've pretty much given up. Instead I did go to the prison museum which was dubbed as the "Hanoi Hilton" by Americans during the war.  This isn't to be confused with the real Hitlon hotel in Hanoi.  This was an interesting experience.  I even got to see Senator John McCain's (sp?) picture up on the wall as he did 6 or 7 years there.  We then took a walking tour around the old district.  It was here I managed to get my most prized souvenir of my trip.  I picked up all six contructicons which together form devastator.  I only expect a few people to understand this.  I think Fountin, Jason and possibly Serd can appreciate how cool this is.  Of course they are fake, made in China I think.  But they are great quality, stickers and everything.  Gotta love it.     Right now it's a lunch and internet break.  Afterwards we'll finish up walking around and I'll try to get some glasses and maybe we'll do some other stuff.   Tomorrow I think the plan will be to chill out a little and try to find a decent tour to Halong bay and to Sappa.  Then it'll be off to Laos.  I don't think I've ever sweated as much in life. RIP Godfather.  1924-2004

      Thank you MJ for that great song.  So I now have Gyeh-son to hang out with which is great.  She is definatly a Korean tourist (see previous) entry but she's trying hard (I'm also doing my best to help).  Caleb brings up some good pionts in his blog about Korean tourists but I'm too tired to add anymore social commentary at this point.  Perhaps another time.   It has been a long day of sight seeing and I'm now killing time until the water pupper show which starts at 6:30.  Today was started by the zoo which wasn't really good by any means but fun anyway.  I feel sorry for some of those animals.  While they didn't seem to have it too bad they sure as hell didn't have it so good either.  The heat here is killer so I can only imagine what the poor bears were feeling like.  If that isn't enough Vietnamese are very antagonistic towards there animals.  They are always throwing things, tapping on the cages and making noises.  They did have some really cool active monkeys I must say.  We then went to the fine art museum and the temple of literature.  I think the fine art museum is the best museum I've seen thus far on my trip.  This place actually had stuff worth seeing and displayed in an attractive fashion.  Not too shabby.  We tried to go to the army museum but it seems that its closed on Fridays.  Stuff is so odd here sometimes.   I'm pretty worn out.  I hope I don't fall asleep during the puppet show.   Gyeh-son managed to squash my glasses yesterday so I need to go get a new pair while I'm here.  I hope they don't cost a lot.  Everything else is cheap here so glasses should be too right?  The a/c in my hotel is awesome.  This thing is like on artic blast or something.  How did I ever survive without it?   Thank yous go out to Asma and Caleb for starting to blog again.  This gives me a little more to read during my travels.  Becky you're consistant and that's appreciated.  Mieka and Gabe you guys need to pick it up.  I've pretty much give up on Andrew.  If he hasn't blogged in 2 monthes I doubt he'll stop now.   I had an interesting encounter yesterday.  For whatever reason we decided to stop in and see the national archieves (which is really just a neat way to say library) and managed to meet a Vietnamese girl who was dying to speak English with a foriegner.  I thought I'd pretty much left this behind in Korea, guess not.  She was really cute as she was visably nervous and confessed that she had no clue what to say.  It was funny at just how excited she was to speak English.  I think she said she had to do this for an assignment in class or something.  What was really funny is that despite the fact that she and Gyeh-son both spoke English they couldn't seem to figure out what each other was saying.  I gave her my e-mail so maybe I'll hear from here someday, maybe not.    I love who cheap food is here.

      Well really I only saw one dead person and that would be Uncle Ho.  Yeah I hit up the masoleum of Ho Chi Minh today.  Very interesting I must say.  Looks like he does in all he pictures, which is good I guess.  I managed to get Gyeh-son without a hitch yesterday which was great.  It's so good to have some company.  I can't blog long since she's wait.  The guy told us there was Korean on the computers but I guess not.   It's so funny, today we ran into so many Korean tourist.  I was at the aiport yesterday and all kinds of organized tours were starting.  I have to say Koreans a possibly the worst tourists ever.  They have no clue what's going on and can't seem to follow and rules or get anything done.  I debate if they should be allowed to leave Korea.  Today we were walking near on of the tours and one of the Korean men on the tour asked who was Ho Chi Minh and why is he so popular.  This is after they went to see him also.  Now mind you this guy wasn't 12 or 13 but well over 50.  Good Lord.  Also while in the tomb the guards had to bark at a group of them continued to talk after they had been told not to.  To sum it all up there was group of girls at the bank who couldn't seem to figure out how to change money or what the exchange rate was.  I wish I could explain how easy this was.  Kevin was right when the told me to aviod them at all costs.  My personal favorite is how they refer to everyone else (including Vietnamese) as foriegners.  Oh man.  I think those of you who live and or lived in Korea can understand.  I've told Gyeh-son her job should be to help them out.   I did lots more but she's waiting so I shouldn't be blogging.  Until next time.

      So today I took a trip to the ancient city of Authaya (sp?). It's about an hour north of Bangkok and made for a very nice day trip. We look around and saw several very impressive temples. I think I'll do something similar tomorrow but this time I'll go to the Bridge on the River Kwai. I figure this is worth seeing while I'm here. I'm really tired. I think I'll get some food after this relax at a cafe have a beer and then write some postcards. I'm reading the Firm now and it's great some how I managed to leave it on the minivan. What happened is that I feel asleep and the book slid off without me noticing. Anyway I should be able to get it back tomorrow. My boss is taking forever to get back to me as usual. Ugh I wonder what would happen if LIKE was actually organized and efficiant. I'm going to make my flight plans for Saturday and hopefully that'll work out. I really love 7 eleven. They have coke slushies and hotdogs. That's just a little bit of heaven on Earth. Since I'll be here tomorrow night I might head out and hit the club. We'll see how I feel when I get back. But there seems to be a difficulty timing everything. Since my flight leaves at 7 in the morning I need to be at the airport around 5. So then if I go to the club should I even bother to get a room or should I stay out all night? The clubs close at 2 which leaves me with 2 awkward hours. Who knows. I might just hang around Khao San then. Ok I'm hungry. See you guys.

      So that's me, I'm a mall rat. At least for today. It is good to take a break from the tourist routine and just relax a bit. I'm back at the super mega mall in Bangkok and I'm loving all 5 floors of it. I saw Collateral today. Pretty good I have to say. One interesting thing, while I was in Myanmar I caught two movies. The thing that struck me odd about them is that they were American movies but they didn't have subtitles. So unless you spoke some seriously great English you weren't going to understand it all. It became obvious they were there just to enjoy the eye candy. So the second film I saw was "Troy." Not nearly as good the second time around but it didn't matter since the Burmese kept me entertained. So first of all they were all goofing off talking and not paying attention whenever there was any kind of dialouge or talking going on. Then when the fights came around everyone got quiet and paid attention. Then after the fight they would all get up and go to the bathroom and start talking again and carry on. What was funny is how the marveled at the special effects. Stuff we taked for granted got oooo's and ahhh's from the crowd. I was having a blast up to this point but nothing could have prepared me for the end. So the Greeks build this horse and then pretend to go home. The poor Trojans take it inside and the rest is history. We all knew how the movie was going to end before we even saw it. But what if we didn't? What if we lived in Myanmar and didn't have a clue? You couldn't possibly imagine the reaction from the crowd when the horse opened up and people started getting out. Really they had no clue that Brad Pitt and his homies were in there. I'm sure some of them must have known but guessing from the gasps and talking most of them didn't have a clue. Talk about nuts. I mean what if you didn't know the ship was going to sink? Man wouldn't you be in for a surprise. Totally off the point but it's a good story. I think I'll take a day tour tomorrow and then fly back on Friday. I'm waiting on one last e-mail from my boss to let me know things are good to go. He managed to botch things up a bit but nothing major. I did get a hair cut that I'm quite happy with. My head is more or less shaved but not exactly. It's a short cut to put it one way. No more Korean haircuts if I can avoid them. I look forward to getting back and relaxing. I have to say I have a pretty good life in Daegu and I'd like to return soon. Hopefully this will be possible. Ok all for now. Gonna try and play some games.

      So I'm back in Thailand now and I can blog.  I'm tired and should be in bed but I felt the need to check my mail and I had to eat before bed so here I am.  Too much has happened in the past 16 days for me to possible put into words in a single entry.  With that being said I'll just spit out whatever comes to mind.  First I'll say Myanmar is by far the most foriegn place I've ever been.  The men wear skirts (they're actually called longi, or something like that), and all have red teeth b/c they chew on this nasty nut.  Then the women put this cream made of some sort of bark all over their face.  These were the first things that hit me when I got there.  Burma is so not a tourist country compared to anywhere else I've been.  There are tourist there but they are few and far between.  I was lucky and ended up traveling with an Israeli girl and and Austrian.  Both of them turned out to be really cool and great company.  I got to do most everything I wanted to do.  While I was there all the bad weather I'd missed this summer seemed to catch up with me.  When I was in the South it rained everyday.  Things go better up North but there some flooded areas that made it difficult to get around.  There was one city I wanted to get to but couldn't b/c of flooded roads.  But I made the best of it and went somewhere else and had a great time.  Going there is literally like walking back in time.  If I had one real complaint it would be with transportation and road conditions.  If you ever go there you should expect to spend a hell of a lot of time on buses getting places.  Rides take forever no matter how short the distance.  This getting annoying after a while.  But I had to say  I had a great experiance.  There is no "one place" that sticks out as the best or most memorable but instead it was all new and exicting.  I really liked Burmese tea, I'll miss it a great deal.  From here who knows where I'll go.  It all depends on when I'm needed back in Korea to start work.  I'm waiting on an e-mail from my boss.  As usual he is extremely unorganized.  Tomorrow I'll just relax and go watch a movie I think.  Ok I'm drained and it's time to bring this to a close.  I'm sure I'll blog again tomorrow.  Night night.
