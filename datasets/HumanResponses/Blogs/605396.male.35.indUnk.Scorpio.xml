       So I got the G3 to work over the weekend.  I still can't seem to get my other blog, over on netpci.com, to work properly. Hell, I can't get it to work at all. I was in Startec+PCI's offices today extending my DSL contract, and I asked a tech support guy what he thought of the problem. He took my business card and promised to look into the problem for me. I hope to hear something in a day or two. If not, I will call again and see if anybody knows what's going on. I suspect that because blogger is trying to access the ftp account from the outside, netpci is bouncing the request back to blogger's servers. I can access the ftp account from within my home because it's within the trusted domain of netpci.com - at least that is my suspicion. hmm

       I am typing this from my G3 and it works again. I am pretty psyched about this development. Now if I could just get that damn Gateway machine to boot up...

        ::Torn::   I am not sure what to do. My G3 refuses to come to life for me. I am torn. I don't know if I should continue to invest time and money into my Macintosh. If money was not object, I'd probably purchase a new G4 tower. But I won't. Money is rather tight right now. More importantly I don't know if I want to continue using the Mac. I've been using my Windows machine for the last 5 months and I haven't really had any complaints. I do most of my work on PC's now, and my interests are gravitating towards Linux. I feel like it is not worth the effort to resurrect this machine just for email and a couple games. I don't know what else to do. New power supply, new voltage regulator, new motherboard, and still everything does not work. I'd like to get it working again, but the law of diminishing returns is starting to apply here.

       There was an earthquake last night. A  big   urlLink one . Shortly after 2:05 am, a 7.2 earthquake struck my island. This is the second time in six months that a large earthquake has struck in the middle of the night, following a 7.0 temblor that shook Guam in October 2001. Last night's quake sent dishes and plates crashing in my house, moved my refrigerator about four feet before dumping its contents on the kitchen floor and broke a number of other things before plunging my home and the rest of Guam into darkness. I can think of nothing worse than these nocturnal earthquakes. They are absolutely terrifying.  But I should thank God no  urlLink major damage occurred . Buildings on Guam are designed to withstand super typhoons, and the reinforced cement block construction holds up pretty well against earthquakes as well. I think the fact that Guam is an island helps as well. It just bounces and jostles around in the ocean instead of grinding up against a continent or other large immovable mass.  As a testimony to that fact, the power was restored this morning shortly before 10:00 am. That is some kind of record for the Power Authority crews. I congratulate them on a job well done.

       My buddy Chris suggests my problems with the motherboard on the Mac are related to a grounding problem. Thinking back, I was concerned about a particular screw last night. Maybe I need to open up the box and check that. I'll also check that the ROM is seated properly  It's been a busy day. My afternoon meeting was productive, but I am afraid it's left my brain a little addled. I am taking a breather right now, trying to collect my thoughts before I proceed.  I won a raffle for a Filipino Lunch Buffet at the Holiday Inn today. It was okay; I never would have sampled the menu otherwise. I don't think the food was terribly tasty, and I was tempted to just go eat Thai instead, but hey - a free lunch is a free lunch. I'm burping up onions and garlic now, there was a type of salsa that was heavy on the garlic. I ate it with my adobo. I guess I should have gone a little easier on it. Maybe I should drink a Mountain Dew, that'll cut through anything!

       Well, it's been a busy evening. And all my endeavours met with failure. Just lovely.     I am attempting to set up a blog over on my netPCI site. It refuses to work correctly, so I imagine a call to tech support/customer service tomorrow is in order. I suspect some condition of the ftp server software is blocking blogger.com from logging in. The error message say no input/output streams were available. However CuteFTP logs in with no problems. I am stumped.  My motherboard for my G3 arrived today and I installed it. My Macintosh now has all new innards: new power supply, new voltage regulator, new motherboard. After all this time and money, I've managed to create a big beige fan. It powers on (at long last), but there is no "bong" of a Mac starting up. No video either, and I can't hear the hard drive spin up. The fan on the power supply comes on though. It does this with a soft power up from the keyboard, as well at the power switch on the front of the tower (which shouldn't work). Something is wrong here too, I suspect the ROM chip isn't socketed correctly. I'll pull it apart tomorrow and take another look at it.  Two of the things I was supposed to finish at work today got stalled. I guess I will be busy playing catch up tomorrow. That always sucks. Especially tomorrow since I am chairing a two - three hour meeting in the afternoon. That leaves me only the morning.   Anyway that's all I got to grumble about this evening. I am off to bed now. I paddled hard after work today and I am bushed.

       I mentioned the wonderful tomatos I got yesterday. That same person showed up at my house last night with a trunkload of tomato and watermelon that she boxed up for me. I was taken aback by her generosity. The night before she is flying off island on vacation, she takes the time to harvest this produce, box it, and personally deliver it to my doorstep. When I asked her why she came by at almost 10:00 p.m. to deliver this stuff, she just said that she had promised to bring some more fresh tomatos and watermelon when we where talking that morning. It just blows me away that she followed up so thoroughly on an offhand comment that was made yesterday morning. I didn't expect to see more tomatos for a few weeks, maybe the middle of next month (if at all). What she did was really cool.

       Well, I think I got a handle on blogging and how to set up a template the way I like. My next step will be to convert my  urlLink netPCI  site over to a blog and adapt one of these blogger templates for my own personal use. A friend was so impressed with the ease of this setup and blogging process she signed up at blogger as well. I guess that is a powerful testimonial about how easy and powerful this home brew blog publishing can be. I know I am enjoying it.  I certainly like the ability to post messages from work to my site. I imagine that sooner or later the corporate I.T. bloodhounds will figure out what is going on and shut down access. I guess I can't really blame them since this isn't exactly work related, but I don't see anybody cracking down on people reading the newspaper, or using the phone for personal calls. And Lord knows there are enough people around here that don't really do any work at all but collect nice salaries for hanging out and making a few phone calls.

       I am now writing this from a G3 Macintosh. The interface is roughly the same as that using a non Internet Explorer browser. That means some of the buttons and features are not available. However, the regular html codes works just fine.  Bold ,  italic ,  urlLink links , they all seem to work using hand coded html.

       Mmmm....  Fresh tomatos. A co-worker just delivered the fruits of her garden to me. Fresh tomatos, delicious honey-yellow watermelon. It makes me want to start a garden. It is such a treat to get fresh, vine ripened tomatos on Guam. The things they sell in the stores that they call tomatos have all the taste of a styrofoam box.

Every time I press publish, my entire customized template is sent via ftp to the kuentos web server, along with the latest posting (this one).

       Quitting time is coming. I can't wait. I don't intend to skip out early, in fact I plan on working late. I just happen to prefer the office when nobody else is around and I can concentrate. Right now I can hear three or four different conversations going on, phones ringing, faxes emitting snarls of white noise, printers humming and all the other distractions. It drives me nuts because I am trying to concentrate.  Sorry, I didn't mean to vent. I guess I am just a misanthrope at heart.

       It's been a busy week at work. Things are in full swing and I think I am starting to fall behind in my tasks. I will endeavour to persevere though.  I've been looking at  urlLink OddPost , a cool web based email client that sure pushes the limit of explorer. My main interest in this email service is that fact that Pacificare's web filtering proxy server doesn't block this address yet, like it does for  urlLink Yahoo  mail and the other free portal sites.  Oh, and I am still contemplating that Alpha computer. Maybe in a few months though.

       Apparently this interface does not work through the magic of iCab, my lightweight browser of choice for my Mac. Oh well. It works in IE 5.5 on my PC - Nothing like catering to the masses. Baloney tastes just fine too, but I don't have to like it.

       I trashed my abortive attempts at a blog on netPCI. It just wasn't working out for me man. I suppose I could just link from that site to this one, but that's a pain.

       I spent a fair amount of time the last few days tinkering with my friend Dianne's blogger template. She is writing a book and wanted a page on the web describing her and her work in progress.

       Here's a little story with a motto.  My water heater has been acting up lately. Since I share the water heater with my landlady's unit next door, I let her know. She agreed and went shopping for a new hot water heater last week.  I came home last Thursday and saw the old water heater sitting in the carport. I popped my head into the house and sure enough, a new water heater was installed. Cool. But this new water heater looked odd. It was all dented and a little rusty on one side. I asked my landlady about it, and she said she bought this unit because it was cosmetically damaged but still worked just fine. And it was offered at a steep discount.  Well, over the weekend I still had no hot water. Every time I mentioned this to my landlady she said the damn pilot kept going out. So I kept relighting the pilot. I probably relit the stupid thing five times over the weekend, and still I had no hot water. I grumbled some more, and she agreed to call the company on Monday.  Yesterday morning (Monday) I was walking out to work when she grabbed me. "I've found out why the water heater keeps going out," she announced. "It's full of rats."

       Oof. Lots of work piling up. I've tried getting a blog going on netpci several times, but dealing with the tech support there is like entering the fourth level of Hell. Their ftp guy is a chucklehead, and he provides me no help at all. Oh well, you get what you pay for. Wait, wait - I pay dearly for my dsl through netpci...

       Things are returning to normal on Guam. My power was restored last Thursday, water service has been good, and my cable tv came back on Wednesday night. That first night back with the air conditioning was a very good thing. It has been so hot and muggy the past two weeks, not a breath of wind. Rainy season sure arrived early this year. People are blaming it on el Ni�o.  I cleared most of the remaining debris from the yard last weekend, though I still have some wood that I need to burn. I decided to burn the bougainvillea rather than carry it out. The thorns are vicious on those things. I couldn't believe the amount of email that was piled up from ten days of not checking it. And most of that was spam. It is really getting out of control. I can't imagine that anyone ever responds to those things.  Anyway, here are some useful links to storm related sites. By far the most useful is the  urlLink Joint Typhoon Warning Center , a naval outfit that actually handles all the storm forecasting for the Pacific and Indian Oceans. But another good site is the  urlLink National Weather Service - Tiyan Office , which has a really good doppler radar image loop. That was instrumental in the hours leading up to the storm. Watching the approaching typhoon I knew it was going to be bad.  Tomorrow morning I am coming in to move my computer and files into a new office. I hope it doesn't take too long.  Just finished listening to Baka's  Baka Beyond  and starting Keola Beamer's  Mauna Kea, White Mountain Journal  in the CD player. Nothing like a little slack key on a rainy Friday afternoon.

       Well typhoon Chata'an struck Guam early Friday morning and lashed the island with wind up to 110 knots. It was a tough storm. Many lost their houses, the power grid was demolished, phones are intermittent, water is sketchy and failing. Yesterday another typhoon passed Guam, the second in five days. Typhoon Ha Long passed 60 miles south of Guam, but the winds were still fierce and caused further damage. Today is the first time I actually sat down in front of a computer in a week. Our office at work suffered moderate water damage when a section of the roof was torn off. We had to relocate the entire building's staff into temporary quarters while management searches for a new location for our offices. I am currently ensconced in an empty exam room with two others from my department. This area is full of people, but we are better off than some departments. Four entire departments got shoehorned into one little store front over the weekend. It looks like a can of human sardines in there. The power is expected to be off for 6 - 8 weeks while the power crews restring lines and test circuits. Not cool. I am looking into purchasing a gas backup generator for my place. Suffice to say these items are in short supply right now and demand is high.  Back to work now... It's actually satisfying to do my job instead of all the shit labor moving furniture and files or clearing out my backyard. Besides I am in air conditioning here.

       The rain finally stopped today, a little before noon. I was ecstatic. I went down to the beach and took a long walk in the sunshine.  Of course it couldn't last. It just started raining again - a wet, drizzling rainfall. It looks like it will continue into the night.

        Still raining. It never ends.   I am looking at a three day weekend, and that is a good thing. Too bad the rain shows no sign of letting up. It will stop someday -  in January.   Woke up this morning with  urlLink Sadie  curled up next to me. She's a sweet little kitty, I do like having her around. I just wish I had a dog too. I had the chance to take  urlLink Miles  when Mel first found him, and I passed it up. My mistake.   Hey, let's try inserting a picture into this blog:   Let's see if this works.

       I just purchased tickets from L.A. to St. Louis over the internet. It was a cheap price and I got 2,000 bonus miles for making the purchase online. This is probably the third or fourth time I've bought tickets off the internet.  I've lost count of how many things I purchase online. Seems like most everything.  urlLink Books ,  urlLink music ,  urlLink hardware  urlLink  ,  urlLink software ,  urlLink computers ,  urlLink food ,  urlLink gift certificates , stuffed animals, toys,  urlLink car reservations ,  urlLink plane tickets ,  urlLink pr0n , just about anything and everything. I've do my  urlLink banking  online, I applied for and pay my  urlLink credit   urlLink cards  online. I buy  urlLink stocks  and manage my  urlLink 401k portfolio  online. It is an integral part of my life. I could not be who I am without the internet. Life on this island would be quite meager indeed without the wonder of online shopping.  Last year for Christmas I got a couple people in my family gift certificates from Amazon and a couple other online places. They both expressed well fear and disappointment that I got them something they would have to redeem online. They both asked the same question:  Is it safe?  Is it safe?? That was a good question to ask in 1994, but in today's world it marks my kindred as 21st century  urlLink Luddites . I was leery of placing orders online many years ago too; in fact the first couple orders I placed I paid by check. But the delays in shipping to Guam proved too great, and I switched to online transactions. Now I don't think twice about placing an order online - hell I prefer the internet to 1-800 numbers. Especially since many companies use convicts as their  urlLink customer service reps . Giving my credit card number to an incarcerated felon makes me nervous, not using 128 bit encrypted SSL over the internet.

       As promised, I found information on a NASA website concerning  urlLink lightning rates . They got a  urlLink satellite  that measures this stuff. There appears to be a strong correlation between upward convection and lightning flashes. And climatic activity over the oceans is markedly lacking in this upward convection. Hence I am not crazy, lightning really does flash more rarely on Guam than on the mainland.  Why the sudden upsurge in lightning around Guam? That's a mystery to me still.

       Lightning and thunder. Again today the lightning and thunder. It is very unusual for Guam to get so much lightning. This unusual weather started almost two weeks ago. It rarely thunders on Guam, even during the height of rainy season. Some unusual atmospheric conditions must be to blame. I am going to search about on the internet and see if I can get an answer to this question. Or perhaps I will seek the answer to the question's opposite: Why is there usually so little lightning and thunder on Guam.

       I downgraded to Mozilla 1.0 after a couple hours last night. The program just wouldn't close properly. Everytime I tried to exit the Mozilla it would close, but when I tried to restart the program I got nowhere. A quick look in the task manager revealed that Mozilla was still running behind the scenes. Trying to close this faceless incarnation of Mozilla resulted in a blue screen of death. Once, twice, three times and I was tired of that behavior. I uninstalled 1.1 and reinstalled 1.0. Sometimes it's just better to ride behind the curve.  Today is another gloomy, wet and depressing day on Guam. I know this is the rainy season, but I am tired of the rain. I crave the sun, I want an absence of mud and mold and puddles. I feel like I am living in Seattle or something.

       Just finished up my lunch with this tasty new hot sauce I stumbled upon:  urlLink Emeril's   Kick It Up   Green Pepper Sauce . Basically it's the same thing as  urlLink Tabasco's  Green Pepper Sauce. Both are made from  urlLink jalape�os  and are more zesty than hot. Justs adds a little zip to anything you put it on.  I like hot sauces, most everything I eat is flavored with either Tabasco or some other hot sauce. My current favorites are from  urlLink Dave's . Dave's Insanity Sauce is one righteous hot sauce. I generally have a number of hot sauces going at one time. A really hot one like Dave's Insanity Sauce, Tabasco, and a milder one, usually a chipotle sauce like  urlLink Mo' Hotta Mo' Betta's   urlLink Chipotle Adobo Sauce  or the jalape�o sauce I originally mentioned. I love the stuff on pizza.  A couple weeks ago I came across another hot sauce I need to add to my collection,  urlLink Quest for Fire Hot Sauce . I would actually call this sauce a marinade or bbq sauce. I think I need to get a jar and marinade some short ribs in this wondrous concoction. A good smoky flavor, with just a bit of lip smacking heat.  God, I'm getting hungry again!

He also defined the title role in  urlLink  Porgy and Bess  , had a successful opera career and was a professor of music at Northwestern. He was 82. Seems like the radio has been alive with his music the past couple days. It is a rousing thing to listen to William Warfield singing  urlLink Aaron Copeland's  version of  urlLink "Simple Gifts."

       I don't know how to process it. This summer has been awash in kidnappings and  urlLink brutal slaying  of young girls by  urlLink psychopaths  and  urlLink homeless . Is there a plague of  urlLink demons  this summer, or is this just the latest  urlLink media frenzy ? Last summer it seemed like every week the media was reporting a new shark attack, this year  urlLink every week  brings another abduction or murder. Some part of me suspects a purpose in these reports, like drumming up support for those new  urlLink implantable identification tags . But that is simply too  urlLink fantastical  to believe.

       Good God. Last week it was stifling in this building, today I am freezing. Positively freezing. I guess all the rain and cool temperatures outside have something to do with it. I sure wish I was wearing a sweatshirt or something right now.  I finally located my date book/planner yesterday in a box. It got misplaced during last month's move. A quick review of the past couple weeks brought up several birthdays and anniversaries I missed. So today a batch of belated greeting cards is going out. My mistake. I apologize to everyone. It won't happen again - I put all the dates into my Psion so it won't happen again. Every relative, every friend, every wedding and anniversary is now recorded.  Funny how I can have multiple computers, scheduling programs, pda's, and a desk calendar; yet still miss birthdays. Clueless I guess.

       Just finished listening to a round of cd's on the stereo. Started off with a burned mix of mp3's from  urlLink Salon.com  - one of the perks of premium membership. Followed up with the Fiona Apple's second album,  urlLink  When the Pawn...   something or other. Finished the trio of music with a Bobby McFerrin and Yo Yo Ma collaboration,  urlLink  Hush .  The last album did wonders to soothe my pounding headache, or maybe it was laying down and reading quietly for about an hour that did it.

       Gone off on a bit of a cooking spree this weekend. Gone domestic you might say. Whipped up a tasty salad on Thursday, lasagne on Friday, chicken cordon bleu with rice pilaf on Saturday and tonight was a hearty stew with fresh home-made onion bread. I have quite a bit of food in the fridge now, which will supply me with a number of nice lunches for the next week. That should stretch the old budget a bit.

        Post layoff analysis...   All the managers that survived yesterday took a pay cut. My boss made it clear that more of the supervisory stuff would be falling on me know that he has four times as many people to command. In a way I think this is kind of cool. While I certainly feel sorry for those that lost their jobs yesterday, facts are times are tough on Guam right now. And looking at it, they kept all the people that are actually doing all the work. I can positively say that a couple of the folks let go on Friday were total  dead wood  that should have been let go years ago. One of the women let go yesterday served absolutely no purpose in the company, none. She collected a paycheck and sat in her nice office doing nothing all day.  On a lighter note, I sat through my first  urlLink fantasy football  draft this morning. I signed up with a bunch of other guys that do this thing yearly. Time for me to give it a go. I more than vindicated myself in the draft, signing up a well balanced roster of guys that should do me proud as the season progresses.  After the draft I went to the movies with a friend and checked out  urlLink  Signs   with Mel Gibson. Pretty good flick, though I was a expecting an alien invasion movie. It was, but the movie wasn't about aliens at all, it was about God. And faith. The Lord works in mysterious ways - that's what this movie was about. I thought the ending was weaker too. But all in all, it was an enjoyable way to pass the afternoon.

       Well, major shake up at work today. Major.  I don't want to go into details, but there were a lot of layoffs today -  of management.  No rank and file employees were touched, just a pile of directors, managers and even vice presidents. With this pollarding of our management, the remaining managers suddenly found themselves in charge of multiple departments across a broad range of areas. I had a meeting for most of the afternoon with some of the survivors, and there was this glazed look in their eyes. Sort of like they'd been hit in the head with a 2x4. I think most of them were expecting to be told to start assembling lists of who to lay off in a month or two, not watch the angel of unemployment pass through their very midst.  At least I still got a job for now. I'd better redouble my efforts to pay off my debts and squirrel away as much cash as possible. With that thought in mind, I think I'll skip Phu's tonight - or maybe not.

       For some reason I stayed late at the office yesterday. I had some tasks to finish up before this morning and I didn't get home until after 7:00 pm. About par for the course actually. I watched  urlLink  Resident Evil   on the DVD, then read some more of Derek Freeman's book,   urlLink Margaret Mead  and  urlLink Samoa  . His  urlLink central tenet , that Mead's analysis of Samoan teenagers in  Coming of Age in Samoa  was inherently flawed, certainly has merit. I know several Samoans, and they all agree that Mead got it totally wrong.   It's funny, I generally seem to have a book that takes me a while to read; I've been working on this Mead book since the beginning of July. Since then, I completed at least three other books and started a fourth. I consider those books as taking a break from the serious book. I can usually polish one off in a day or two, while the more serious work takes a month or two. It was the same way with the  Seven Storey Mountain.  That book took me three months to read and I read four others during the same time frame.  To finish off this train, I keep a list of what I read this year (or is on deck to be read). It can be found  urlLink here.

       Oof, it is hot here in our temporary office space. The air conditioners went crazy yesterday and today the problem is only worse. At best I would say it is stuffy in this building, in my particular office it is stifling. Three computers, two printers, two people in an enclosed space makes for a hothouse when the air conditioning is out. I might have to bail out from work early if this continues. I just can't fathom being in a meeting for three hours this afternoon and being this uncomfortable. I'd rather go home.

       Just got off the phone with a fellow in New Jersey. After we concluded our business, out came the usual "What time is it there?" questions. Some people are just bamboozled by the fact that our planet is round. And I live on the other side of it from the United States. Think Japan when you talk to somebody in Guam, we share the same time zone with Tokyo for half the year.  At least this guy called at a reasonable hour. Seems like most folks I deal with back there like to call during the middle of the night on Guam. The usual culprits are telephone operators at mail order outfits. They call during a convenient time for them, like 3:30 am Guam time. I once got a call from the vice president of a software company I was evaluating to replace some legacy systems. He called at 1:30 in the morning. Needless to say they didn't get the sale on that system. One of the small tribulations of living on Guam.

       Well off to bed. I just finished watching  Am�lie,  what a delightful movie. I could tell the director also did that movie with  urlLink Ron Perlman  a few years ago,  The City of Lost Children.  Though miles apart in mood and setting, they shared a wonderful sense of imagination. I am glad I rented it, especially since it never made a theatrical release on Guam.

       My  urlLink Psion  was acting up yesterday. I really enjoy the little PDA, it's really more of a palm sized computer than a PDA, but it can be tempermental. The backup battery peetered out yesterday afternoon, leaving me in a lurch during a meeting. The Psion completely froze and then refused to power up. Even whenI plugged in the power adapter it was acting erratic. I ended up wiping the internal memory of the little fella, then rebuilding from a backup.  Speaking of backups, I sorely need to backup all the data on my computer at work. I lost everything a couple weeks ago and the only thing that saved my ass were the regular backups I performed. Even those weren't enough though, my data was a couple weeks old at that point and I lost almost all the GovGuam negotiation files I created. I am still trying to recreate what I lost, data updates, spreadsheets, memos. I think most of it has been replaced, so now is the time for a new backup. Guess I'll be working late tonight finishing up that task.

       I had a smashing headache for most of yesterday, along with a strong desire to just curl up in my bed and sleep for about 12 hours. I was feeling better by the evening though. Just took some food and  urlLink Aleve .   I rented up the  urlLink Lord of the Rings -  The Fellowship of the Ring   DVD at  urlLink Blockbuster  and I was a little peeved to discover that another DVD is coming out in November with all the extra  urlLink "Special Edition"  footage and extras. Bummer. I still can't wait for December and the  Two Towers.  I liked  The Fellowship of the Ring,  but it is lacking the detail of Tolkien's books. Some things needed to be sacrificed in the translation though, and I think the director did a right good job of conveying the timbre of Middle Earth and the struggle between overwhelming evil and oppressed good.

       I was just listening to a story on  urlLink NPR's  "All Things Considered" about a  urlLink Trappist  monastery. It was a little disappointing. I thought the story would reflect some sort of upsurge in interest in the monastic order, but instead it was about how the new monastery was built by an architect and how tragically hip the building is when compared to other monasteries built in the 20th century. Who cares what a monastery in the Czech Republic looks like? I was hoping for some insightful thoughts into a rejuvenation of the priestly orders, which have been so  urlLink sorely tested  this year in the United States.  I paid particular attention since I just finished reading  urlLink Thomas Merton,  a Trappist monk who was also a prolific writer and thinker. This only made my disappointment more poignant.

       Cracked a tough nut in Excel this evening. Arrays powerful things, but the sorcery behind the formulas befuddles me at times. I struggled for about two hours to nail one error that was tossing all my arrays into chaos. Turned out the problem lay in the  VLOOKUP  function that feeds data into a range, which is reference by the array. Took a while to track down that problem. I can go to sleep now and polish off the project first thing tomorrow at work. That is cool.

       Rained again this morning. I actually stayed up until 4:30 this morning. It started raining a little after midnight and it was still going strong when I finally hit the sack. Funny how the sun was shining when I went into work a three hours later.  Oh work. Bastion of numerous insurmountable projects with looming deadlines. What the hell! Toss on a couple more must do assignments onto my pile. I used to call it a burden, now I call it job security. I am going to install that Personal Brain software on my machine at work though. I must do something to manage all the myriad tasks I juggle daily. I tried messing with the Brain software over the weekend and it looks like something I can test drive.  Came home this evening to frustration. My air conditioner was dripping last night. Tonight it was a damn waterfall. A little ingenuity solved the problem though. The drainage hose was blocked so after struggling from the inside of the house I retreated outside. I pulled the hose out of the drain pipe, turned on my garden hose, and shot a blast of water up the drainage hose. That cleared it right out and now I am happy again.  My  urlLink landlady  took off this morning for a week in Chu'uk diving with the  urlLink Blue Lagoon Dive Shop . This is the third trip this year, researching and diving in conjunction with her book on the history of Truk Lagoon. She left me with a couple chores to do in her absence, mostly dog or book related. I don't mind, I get a great deal on the rent in return. We have a  urlLink symbiotic  relationship.

       Did I mention the  e. coli ? Guam's water supply has been in jeopardy because of the typhoon. The low water pressure caused by the loss of electricity at the pump houses allowed fecal coliform bacteria to slip into the public water supply. Most of the island remains under a boil water notice.  Even worse, several local bottled water vendors tested positive for  e. coli , including the water vendor that my office uses. I don't want dysentary, and I certainly don't want cholera. Been drinking a lot of beer, it's as good a reason as any to drink.

       For the past week, the relics of a saint toured the island of Guam. The remains of St. Therese of Liseaux, known at the  urlLink Little Flower , visited churches throughout the island. St. Therese was a Carmelite nun, so the sisters at the Carmelite mission on Guam actually came out of their cloister to attend mass. The last time that happened was 1981, when Pope John Paul II celebrated mass in Agana. The Little Flower is a very popular saint among Catholics worldwide, and many find inspiration in her example.

       Tonight I plan on staying up late - or getting up very early. Probably very early.  urlLink The Perseid meteor shower  should be reaching its culmination in the early morning hours of Sunday morning. I could also do this on Monday morning, but it's just better to get up on Sunday morning. The weather has been pretty clear the last few days, so I am hoping for clear skies. It seems like every year Guam is in a great position for the Leonid meteor showers, but the weather is just atrocious in November. Constant rain and overcast skies. I am hoping to get a good look at the meteors tomorrow morning.

       Hit  urlLink Phu's Place  again last night. Only stayed a couple hours though. Met the boys from work and pulled numbers for the Fantasy Football Draft. I've never played fantasy football before, but I will hold my own with this group of guys. I need to spend some time putting together a draft order and game plan before the August 24 draft date.  Saw  urlLink Fred Peters  briefly. That dude has been scarce for the longest time. Turns out he was on the annual summer tour of Southeast Asia. I guess now that school is back in session he's back to work at  urlLink St. John's .  I left Phu's early and went to  urlLink  Cost-U-Less . My refrigerator has been empty since the typhoon. Yesterday I was scrounging around for something to eat for lunch. I fell back on canned soup, but that is not my first choice for steady meals. So Cost-U-Less is a couple hundred dollars richer today, and my fridge is full of vegetables, meats, cheeses, butter, spices and condiments. I will feast tonight. I bought some nice steaks from the meat department.

       I like  urlLink Blogger.  I really do. But I think I need something closer to what  urlLink Eastgate  makes,  urlLink Tinderbox . Instead of creating blogs, Tinderbox focuses on creating and managing thoughts. The weblog feature of Tinderbox is almost an afterthought. What I really need is something to get a handle on the people, emails, projects, data and meetings I juggle during a typical day at work. It looks like Tinderbox would do that nicely.  But that only works on the Macintosh platform right now, and whether I like it or not, I spend most of my time on Windows 2000 boxes now at work. The Mac is a luxury I come home to in the evenings, but that is just not the most creative or alert time of my day. I just want to vegetate after a long day at work, watch a little TV or browse the web briefly. I don't have the time or energy to devote to something like Tinderbox at home. And I often don't remember thoughts or reminders eight hours after I wanted to write myself a little note about them. I am in information overload, like so many other people today.  Enter  urlLink The Brain . This company makes a very slick product, similar to Tinderbox called the Personal Brain. I downloaded it today and I am going to give it a test drive at home. If I like it, I'll probably install it on my machine at work so I can start to get a handle on the information I deal with everyday.

       Well of course I stayed home today.  And it is good.  Slept late, ate a nice breakfast, read the paper, read a magazine, and I am doing several loads of laundry. Makes me realize how much I don't like working.That 18 months off of work was a real enjoyable time for me. Except for the not having any money part. That sucked.  Anyway, if I get all my laundry and house cleaning done today I will have my entire weekend free and clear before me. That's a real treat. I have some home improvement projects that I need to resolve, more on those when they are finished. I think I will enjoy the results.

       I am troubled. I have things to do tomorrow at work - lots of things. Mostly boring meetings, but some work is needed before I go into these meetings. But I also have special dispensation to take Friday off and relax since last week was a  BITCH  and I worked like crazy. I know if I stay home tomorrow I will feel guilty - at least for a while. So should I stay home and play hookie or come into work and be bored and pissed off that I came into work on a day I could have taken off? Such sorrows.  Hell, who am I kidding? I am going to take tomorrow off and relax...

       My  urlLink Dell  Win2K box suffered a horrible death yesterday. Turns out the IS guys hooked up my 40 gig data drive to the wrong EIDE controller and the whole thing went FUBAR. Fried the controller and corrupted the hard drive. And since that drive had all my data on it, I am pretty upset. Makes the case for making backups religiously. My oldest backup was two weeks old - a lifetime when you consider all the work I did last week is lost now. And that means all the work I did for the GovGuam negotiations is lost. I'm pretty upset, but it could have been a lot worse.  On the other hand, what could I expect? Dell makes crummy computers, and the drive that went to the great digital heaven was a  urlLink Western Digital . Another brand known for shoddy equipment. This is what comes from penny pinching. Lost work and down time for employees. "Dude, your getting a Dell." Uh oh.

Plus Quizno's is located next to Ban Thai, my favorite Thai restaurant. So if I make the haul all the way there, I usually end up eating Thai food.  And that's a good thing.

       I changed the template for this blog to something a little more pleasing to my eye. Since I am the only one reading this I figured I might as well make it good for me.   I was involved in my first high level negotiations for our company and the Government of Guam. This happens every year and I always knew it to be a tense time for those involved. Now I understand. I was working non-stop last week, churning out data and variables like mad for the actuaries and underwriters. I can honestly say I don't want to step foot inside the hotel Nikko for another year. Too much time spent in anonymous ballrooms and negotiating tables.  The weather on Guam has improved markedly the past week. The sun was shining and the winds blew once again. And now that the negotiations are over, I will have the time to start paddling and other outdoor activities once again. That makes me happy.

       Just returned from an amazing meal at  urlLink Maggiano's.  Wow - that meal shamed me. I couldn't finish half of the food that was placed before me. It was just excellent Italian food, washed down with a  urlLink black & tan . It's useless to even ask for a black & tan on Guam, so I better start ordering more of those. I'm only back here for a short while. And talk about a small world. The manager of the restaurant is the ex-wife of the president of our company back on Guam. I knew she left Guam and moved to the Mainland, but what were the chances of running into her?  I certainly got my fill of tasty food this trip. Last night's dinner was at this little taco place called  urlLink Rubio's ; it was very tasty and cheap. Mahi fish tacos and grilled chicken fajitas for only $6. I'm pretty sure I'll be eating there again.  I certainly haven't lost any weight on this trip, that's for sure.  Tomorrow we move from this hotel to another one in Cypress, about twenty minutes up the road. After we check in at that hotel, we're going to the Angels game against the Mariners. I can't remember the last time I went to a baseball game, so I should have a good time. Maybe I'll  urlLink rush the first base coach  if I get bored.

        My eye's are opened.   I visited several offices this week here in Orange County. I don't think any of them would qualify as out of the ordinary set ups or especially cash-rich companies. But what I have seen is humbling. When I compare the office on Guam with what exists here in the states, I am awed. The layout of the offices, the building, the furniture, the lounges, the private offices, the conference rooms; everything is really nice. Guam is a red-headed stepchild to the rest of the company. And these people all seem to enjoy their jobs and where they work. I face each morning at work with a sense of dread. That's not good for my professional development, the company I work for, or even my health in the long run.  I guess the upshot of this is, I want to get a job back here on the Mainland now. I feel like I am missing so much living on that island.

       Almost a week in LA now. My feelings towards this gigantic megalopolis, this warren of streets and urban sprawl; well I like it. Perhaps I am being shallow, but the weather is great, the women are all beautiful, there is so much too do and so many places to go. I am amazed. There isn't enough time in the evenings to see everything I want to see. I work all day like crazy, which is cool too. Lots to do, learning a lot about our Sybase implementation and the data model. Good stuff.  Of course what really sucks is spending all day in these courses, then working at night to help out the guys back on Guam. It's nearly midnight here, but it's only going on five in the afternoon on Guam. So I have a ton of email to read, and chores to accomplish for those guys back on the island.  Oh yeah, found the hot tub at this Marriot yesterday. That was a very good thing. Very good.

       It's a close game today in the fantasy football league, but I think I just might have a win. I still have  urlLink Michael Vick  playing in my game, and my opponent only has  urlLink Corey Dillon . Both our players are going head to head in the evening  urlLink NFL game . We are tied right now, but I am sure Vick will post great numbers against Cincinnati. And Dillon will get shut down by Atlanta's defense. And if I win, that makes me the only undefeated team in our league. Rookie's luck I guess.  OHOO! And Vick just tossed another touchdown pass! That puts me in the lead!

       So on the way here I stopped over in Hawaii for about 8 hours. This gave me a chance to hook up with an old college buddy, Brian, who manages a hotel in Waikiki. He picked us up from the airport and we drove to Waikiki. He took us to his hotel on the beach to pass the hours. We checked out the hotel and the room Brian had for the weekend, a penthouse suite on the 38 th  floor.  When I mentioned that I'd like to take a shower and change my clothes, he replied "Yeah dude, you're pretty ripe." Well those were the wet clothes I wore on Friday in Guam, after 16 hours on the plane. No excuses there. Problem was all my clothes were in the checked baggage at the airport. A quick discussion led us to the ABC store right outside the door of the hotel. I went looking for shorts and a t-shirt. Found the shorts no problem, but when I was looking for a shirt, the woman working the store stepped up and gave me the stink eye. "We only have shirts to XL," she said as she gave me a sidelong look. "I got some XXL over here though." I'm not too proud to be offended. Hell, I'm a big boy, let's face it. I found a reasonable shirt and took it to the checkout, along with my shorts. At least a XXL is large on me still. My travelling companion Chris didn't even bother to get a shirt, though he was just as stinky as me. When I asked him about it, he said that XXL is just too small on him now. Wow, now that's big.  Oh, I think I got the problem figured out. The one where I can't post to this web log, or login to a variety of sites. The machine is set with the wrong date and time for California, and the browser is not accepting cookies. Unfortunately I cannot change this right now. I am not set up as an administrator on this machine. I need to call the IS guys back on Guam and get the password to make that change to my user rights. Then I will be okay.  I woke up about three hours ago - not too bad after only one day back on the Mainland. Tomorrow I should be okay during our training.

       It's almost 10:00 pm here in California, and I am weary. Again. The trip threw my internal clocks into chaos and I don't know if I want to sleep or stay up. I tried to sleep this afternoon, but it was useless. Hopefully I will adjust in the next day or two and then be fine. That's the main reason I came here a couple days early - to adjust myself and get settled in.

       I arrived in LA last night after 24 hours of travel. I was wiped out last night and slept late today. Now I am watching live college football on the television, something I ain't done in ten years.  Obviously the hotel has internet access, that's pretty cool. It gives me the chance to stay on top of things back home and stay in contact with family and friends. And I can keep posting to the blog with no interuption.  I left Guam on Friday evening and arrived in Hawaii on Friday morning. Since I had an eight hour layover, I essentially got a free day in Hawaii. I called up a college buddy and he took us to his hotel in Waikiki. We spent the day out by the pool, drinking beers, talking story, and watching the folks down on the beach below us. It was a good visit, though I wish I could meet his wife and their new baby. Oh well, next time I get to Hawaii I'll make it a longer stay.  I got into to LA at 1:00 a.m. Saturday. Since it was too late to pick up the rental, we took a shuttle bus down to the heart of Orange County, where I am sitting right now. My partner left a short while ago to fetch the rental car. I hope he makes it back soon; I am pretty hungry after two days of crummy airline food. I need to eat...

       The rain started falling last night, and it will not stop. Not a slow gentle rain, but a driving, blinding downpour. I am glad to be leaving in a few hours for sunny California. Of course I am soaked to the bone right now, and I'll be wearing these soggy clothes for the next 25 hours, which is not a pleasant prospect for me. But I'll survive.  Last night was a fine sendoff with my friends. The dinner was excellent, comprised of the bounty of the sea; broiled swordfish, blackened ahi tuna, sashimi, fresh bread, kang kong and other goodies. The company was excellent, and the conversation was broad and interesting. The only problem; once I came upstairs and starting getting serious about packing I was exhausted. Instead of packing and preparing, I went to sleep until about four this morning. Ah, it all turned out all right in the end, but I was busy this morning with my chores. The rain didn't help any either.

       Just booked a car and hotel in St. Louis for the last leg of my journey. My parents offered to let me crash at their place, but I don't think it's appropriate to be hanging out at the old folks home with them. I just got a motel room instead, conveniently close to the  urlLink Borders  and  urlLink Old Navy  franchises. I think I'll be spending a good deal of time at those places in a couple weeks.

Now if I could just finish Dr. Zhivago...  I need to pack tonight, and a host of other chores. I suspect I will be up most of the night. Thank God for coffee.

       Two days until I fly off into the blue nowhere, riding in an uncomfortable coach seat. Oh well. I tried and tried, but got nothing for my troubles. Next time I fly Continental and upgrade to business first.  Pulled out my luggage this morning. Some of it will be mostly empty, since I plan on buying a suit or two while in the states, plenty of shirts and slacks and such stuff. At least I can upgrade my  urlLink wardrobe  with no difficulty.  So much to do and only three days of work left to do it. I got a lot of work to finish up before we go.  That  urlLink radio paradise  web radio is really cool. I can't stop listening to it.

       The winds returned promptly at six this evening.

       Tomorrow morning already. Listened to that  urlLink web radio  for several hours last night, and I am listening to it again right now.  Well, I am feeling pretty confident about week two in the  urlLink fantasy football league . I am currently leading in my game, thanks in large part to the Patriots defense. And both my running backs don't play until later this evening and tomorrow.  I just checked - the price of  urlLink TinderBox , a Macintosh based personal  urlLink knowledge management system , increased from $95 to $145. I intend to master that program eventually and use it extensively. The price increase irks me to no end though. Business can't be that good. Oh well, I'll keep my eyes open and hope the price drops again during a promotion.

       Since I am chained to my  urlLink Dell  enjoying this audio feed, I guess I'll make some comments on the blogging experience. I've been doing it for several months now, and I think I am going to upgrade to  urlLink Blogger Pro  once I get back to Guam in October. Looking at the past few months of blogging, I can say it has prompted me to use the Dell more often, and  urlLink Internet Explorer  instead of  urlLink Mozilla . Call me a minority or elitist, but I purposely avoided using Internet Explorer as my browser - I used Mozilla and another  urlLink Gecko  based browser called   urlLink K-Meleon  almost exclusively on this machine. I still use Mozilla daily; both on my Mac and this PC, but Internet Explorer honestly has more to offer. Oddpost is very cool, and it only works on IE 5 and above on Windows. Userland's Radio, Blogger, and LiveJournal all present richer editing interfaces through Internet Explorer. So I am grudgingly using the application instead of Mozilla. And what really surpises me is how much I am enjoying it. I am being corrupted by the dark side...

       Ah Sunday night. Time to relax, turn on some jazz, cook a nice meal and steel myself for the hell that is Monday through Friday at work.  I was just checking out  urlLink Scott Rosenberg's  blog on  urlLink Salon  and followed the link to  urlLink Radio Paradise . Wow. I found something cool on the web - that's a first! Music, music that never makes it on the radio on Guam. I am enthralled. The rise of the internet really made a difference in my life. Others can ignore it, but life on Guam is much richer than it used to be; all thanks to the internet. I definitely would not have lasted as long as I have on this island without access to the internet.

       I am getting sick of television. This growing distaste follows in the footsteps of my loathing for radio. I only listen to public radio now. I never could stand talk radio, and top 40 has increasingly disenfranchised me. The 'classic rock' station favors speed metal now, and the easy listening stuff caters to catatonic fools. Now television has betrayed me; I find myself watching less and less of the crap being played. I get cable from my landlady's feed, but I certainly wouldn't miss it if she cancelled it. I kept telling myself that at least I could watch sports, but I find sports programming worse than anything else. The insipid commercials, the inane chatter, I can't stand any of it.

       Didn't make the hike this morning. I walked to Pago Bay from my house to watch the launching of canoes for the  "Northern Passage"  around Guam. The scheduled start of this race was 7:30 am - when I turned around and headed for home at 8:15 the canoes were still on the beach. There was not a great deal of activity going on either. Typical Guam paddling event. That's one of the main reasons my paddling has fallen by the wayside; the races and other events are just pathetic. I am sure they started eventually, but I didn't care to stand around for another 45 minutes waiting for them to get their act together.  I had to check my network settings this morning. The Dell lost connection with the router overnight. Damned if I know why. Anyway, I just finished cleaning the bedroom; time to start on the bathroom after my little break is over.

       Busy weekend on tap.    Hiking tomorrow.  urlLink The Boonie Stompers  are heading to Maguagua Falls, a favorite of mine.  Heavy duty cleaning/laundry on tap back home for the entire weekend. Got to clean the house before I leave, and make sure I got enough clean clothes to last four weeks on the road. Should also cut the grass and power wash the lanai. That's a lot of work too.  Guam's 2nd incarnation of  urlLink Fray Day  starts at 6:30 pm Saturday at  urlLink UOG's   urlLink English Department Atrium . I think I will head over and check it out. Maybe I'll even tell a story...  I got the urge to ride my bike this weekend too. I got this idea that I should start cycling to work again, so it might be a good idea to get back in the saddle this weekend.  If I don't bike on Sunday, I'll probably head to  urlLink Tarzan Falls  in the morning. Stretch the legs and all that jazz.  I really want to finish  urlLink Dr. Zhivago  this weekend too. One less book to bring along.    Any other ideas? Email me and let me know.

       Just finished another DVD,  urlLink  Cast Away   with Tom Hanks. I like the somber mood of the film, the fact that his life on the island isn't glamorized or cheapened (no battles with sharks, no headhunters, no Gilligan's Island tomfoolery). Just a man struggling to survive in maddening solitude. Utterly alone.

       Just got out of a meeting with a couple of the new "mega" managers at Pacificare. It's funny. Listening to these people bitch about the crud and lousy systems in place in their new departments. It was almost funny to hear this one guy belly-aching about the humongous accounts receivable that he inherited in his new department. I was like "Duh, I've been saying this for a year and nobody was listening to me." Then he moved on to the IT systems and he immediately hit the nail on the head again. Welcome to my world buddy.

       I eat my words. The upgrade is not a possibility and I am ticked off at the way it was handled.  Here's the deal. The "executive administrative assistant" at work booked these tickets on  urlLink Northwest  over the internet instead of using a real travel agency on Guam. I guess it was her thought to save some dollars. Well in the course of trying to get my upgrade this morning, I discovered that the ticket was only reserved, it hadn't been purchased yet. Turns out she supplied the wrong address for the corporate credit card and it didn't process correctly. So I had to spend hours on the phone this morning to fix the situation and get the tickets issued. She certainly couldn't be bothered to do her job, especially since the plan president is off island. Since she reports directly to him, she doesn't even bother to come into work when he's not around.  So I finally got the ticket issued, that was step one. Step two involved calling  urlLink Continental  to get the upgrade since I accrue my miles on Continental's OnePass program. That turned into another half hour on the phone before finding out that my fare was not upgradeable. So another call to Northwest, another 20 minutes on the phone, another $271 and the fare is now upgradeable.  Called Continental again. Now all available upgrade seats are taken. None are left on any leg of the journey except the 3 hour flight from Guam to Narita. ARGHHH!!! So it looks like I will be sitting in a damn coach seat for my trip. Though the rep at Continental said to call again tomorrow and hope for the best. Great, just great.

       Just finished watching  urlLink  The Red Violin .  Excellent. That score - I'd seen it before, but the DVD and stereo through the TV really brings out the music. I'll be humming it for days now.  I find films that follow an object around very interesting.  urlLink  Twenty Bucks   is another example of this genre, and a fine little film too. E. Annie Proulx's novel,  urlLink  Accordion Crimes,   is probably a closer match to The Red Violin though. Both follow musical instruments through sorrow and loss, through decades of use in the hands of a succession of people. Proulx's book ultimately dissapointed me though, it felt strangely lacking in passion. The movie however, is all over the top emotion and music. It is a more visceral experience than the novel.

       One year ago today I was in the air, winging my way back to Guam.  It was the evening of September 11. I was at Narita, waiting for my evening flight to Guam. All the Northwest flights leave from a single circular concourse and the room was crowded with passengers. I just wanted to get home, I was tired and grumpy.  As we overflew Saipan, I was concerned to see the airport was dark on that island. "Must be shutdown for the night," was my first thought. As we approached Guam, I saw that Andersen AFB was dark as well, and that our destination, the Guam International Airport was also a black hole in the night. "What the hell is going on?" I thought. We were high, far too high for a normal approach. At the last instant, the big 747 literally nose-dived down to the runway and landed.  As I left the plane, I was surprised to see a contingent of Marines standing at the end of the jetway in combat fatigues and bristling with weapons. "What the hell happened?" I asked a fellow passenger. He didn't know either. We were the first off the plane, so we headed to immigration. That was were we heard the news. As I spoke to the immigration officer, a voice carried the news; the second tower had collapsed. Rumors were rampant; the Capitol was destroyed, the White House was hit, car bombs were exploding at embassies around the world. In the space of three hours the world had gone insane.  My ride was waiting for me, and we drove to my home. Once inside, I immediately turned on the the television and watched the horrible images. I think the television was on for about 24 hours straight that day. It was the middle of the night on Guam, but I still called some local friends, woke them up, and told them to turn on the television. Called my parents, called my sister, tried to call my friend in New York. But mostly I sat looking at the television.  There, that's my 9/11 story - though most of it really takes place on 9/12. It's been a year and the world is still a troubled and violent place. I don't think anything's changed at all.

       My friend Nieves almost got shot yesterday. She was wandering around the Aga�a Swamp, looking for donne' peppers and kang kong to harvest. She walked into a clearing and found herself looking at the business end of a shotgun. One of her neighbors was camped out in the swamp, waiting for the thieves that killed three of his cows in the last week. These poachers killed his cows, took the loins, and left the rest of the animal to rot.  After she got done telling me this story, she asked me how my day was. Uh, not bad; certainly didn't compare to her little adventure.

       An  urlLink interesting story  about the Grateful Dead and Deadheads at Slate today. I like the Grateful Dead and their music, but the story does make a good point. I was always a little put off by the forced bliss at concerts and how it almost seemed like a ritual. A rather fossilized ritual in fact.

       The first week is over in fantasy football, and my team did me proud. I outscored 10 of the teams in our 12 team league. Victory is sweet, especially since most of my comrades are firm believers in trash talk and mocked me several times. Hah! Vindication...

       There's an  urlLink interesting piece  on  urlLink Salon  today about this movie Max that portrays Hitler as a frustrated artist in 1918. It is already drawing fire from commentators and  urlLink Jewish groups , calling the piece an obscenity for showing a human side to Hitler. It sounds fascinating, a film that challenges conceptions and opinions. Just the sort of thing that will never be shown or achieve mass appeal. I can avow that this  movie will never be shown on Guam. Never.  I found this quote interesting.  "There is a tendency among some conservatives to talk about figures like Hitler and bin Laden as beyond human understanding, as a dark force that just sprang full-born into the world. "Max" shows that evil has nuances -- it doesn't just emerge in its full nightmarish quality instantly, it develops day by day, it has its own evolution. That makes it more horrific."   Curious thing though, this rabid demonization of Hitler and the Nazi's. Certainly they were evil and perverted, but they were humans once. Some kernel of humanity must exist in their stories. I've seen war movies featuring Japan as the enemy, and several of these films depict the Japanese in a favorable light. Why is this taboo for the Nazi's? Some societal undercurrent is at play here, I need to think it through some more.

       Last night I enjoyed a wonderful dinner with some friends. The main attraction was tenderloin beef. I can't remember the last time I had a steak that tasted so good. And the salad was divine, dressed in a shoyu/lemon concoction from Japan. Very delicious. I contributed fresh baked pesto bread, direct from my bread machine. It was a very good meal, accompanied by an excellent cabernet. The dessert was light and refreshing, grapes and strawberries from the farmer's market. And the conversation was excellent, with plenty to discuss; the election, the foundering test scores at Guam's schools, scuba diving, and upcoming trips the lot of us are planning to make. A very good meal indeed.

       It's pretty easy to see that fantasy football is big business on the web. Leagues of armchair coaches around the United States devote an immense amount of time and effort in the maintenance of their teams. I decided to check it out this year, and it is mildly interesting. I guess a true devotee of the NFL is in heaven with these fantasy leagues. More stats than you can shake a stick at. And that's just for football. Fantasy leagues thrive for baseball, basketball, even hockey. These things existed before the web, but the proliferation of the internet made it manifestly easier to manage a league, and all the information needed to make intelligent decisions about teams and players.  I was talking with a friend today about this phenomenon. He put it succintly; it's a way for guys to avoid dealing with their wives. That struck me as a profoundly sad statement, but I could feel the veracity of what he said.

       Well my first week line-up in  urlLink fantasy football  is currently losing to my opponent  urlLink this week , 82-80. However, his players are finished for the week, and my defense is playing in the Monday night game. The defensive scoring includes fumbles, interceptions and sacks in addition to safeties and touchdowns and special teams scoring, so I can tentatively state that I will be winning my first outing in fantasy football land. I only need a sack, fumble or interception to tie; one of each and I win.   urlLink Next week however , looks to be a difficult matchup. The team to beat this season. Thank God I only play him once all season.

       Yesterday was the primary for this fall's elections. A lot is on the line, with the gubernatorial race, local senators, and the house delegate seat all up for grabs. Results can be found  urlLink here .  1998's elections were  urlLink hotly disputed , eventually going before the US Supreme Court to decide the winner of the gubernatorial race. One of the culprits for that election's confusion was the combined ballot, with house, local senate, and gubernatorial races all on a single ballot. Several thousand people voted for local senators but left the governor's race blank and were counted as blanks. This left the winning candidate with less than 50% of the total votes. Guam's Organic Act, the law incorporating the island's government, states that the winner of the election is the candidate with the majority of the votes cast. The case went before the US 9 th  district court, and eventually the  urlLink US Supreme Court .  I was not surprised to find three different ballots at this year's election, to rectify any confusion caused in the last election. Regrettably, the Guam Election Commission decided to print all three ballots on the same size and type of paper, leading to confusion and possible miscounting. This slowed the  urlLink tabulation at UOG .

On the other hand, Continental gets good marks for their food, especially in Business First Class. Thank god for frequent flier upgrades.  My left knee has been giving me fits the last three days. It was scoped back in 1990, when I got the  urlLink meniscectomy . The pain is coming from the outside of the knee, where my  urlLink torn ligaments  are. This doesn't make me very happy at all.

       I stopped at the Hag�t�a Post Office this morning during my commute. Looks like the magazine shipment arrived. Ever since 9/11, federal regulations prohibit passenger flights from  urlLink transporting mail . This severely impacted Guam since Continental carried all the mail. The  urlLink USPS  signed a contract for a 727 cargo plane to make the daily run, but the company was unable to keep up with the load. A new carrier signed on a few weeks ago, but the flights are twice a week now. The mail is backed up on both sides of the run, here on Guam and in Hawaii. Express and Priority mail get top priority in the shipping, so parcel post and magazines dawdle in Hawaii for months before arriving on Guam. Yesterday I picked up a  urlLink Rolling Stone  from May, June and July, the last two issues of  urlLink Outside , and three issues of  urlLink MacWorld . I subscribe to  urlLink National Geographic  and  urlLink Archaeology , but I ain't seen an issue from either of them since February.  Needless to say, I got a lot of catching up to do tonight when I get home.

       If I'm going to continue with this blog, I should probably start customizing the page. I need to add some or all of the following;   About Pages  Reading lists  Movie Watch List  Updated Favorite Links  Figure out how to create an RSS feed in blogger  Figure out how to subscribe to other RSS feeds through blogger  If blogger can't help me, maybe I need to switch to another web log software. I download  urlLink Radio Userland , and the idea of creating a Radio blog on  urlLink Salon  is intriguing. Perhaps I need to follow up on that possibility.

       I tried some  urlLink Tabasco Chilpotle  hot sauce tonight with my dinner. Tasty stuff. I'm going to search for my own bottle next time I go shopping. It's got a good smoky flavor and a little bit of heat.    I got a good story here:  I frequently get pelted with computer questions at work by fellow employees. I am known as the 'computer guy' by a fair number of the non-technical staff. They ask me questions about their home computers, usually stuff like "My modem doesn't work, what should I do?" Like I have any idea. I usually offer some vague suggestions; "Reinstall the drivers," or "Check that the phone line is plugged into the modem." My general advice is to take the computer in to the shop if they don't know what their doing.   So today I walked in on a discussion between two dental assistants. I was immediately consulted, "Ask Tom, he'll know."  I looked over and saw one of the guys going through the yellow pages. "What will I know?" I asked.  My co-worker looked up. "I need to find somebody that sells virtual machines," he said.  I looked at him askance, "A what? A virtual machine?"  "Yeah. I was on the computer last night and the internet said I needed a  urlLink 'Java Virtual Machine'  installed in my computer. Do you know anybody on island that sells them?"  Boy, where to begin with that one? I explained that a virtual machine was not hardware, it was software, it was free, and he had to download it from the internet. He just looked at me increduously, "You mean you can do that?" he asked. Yep, free as in beer my buddy.  I got up to leave and he asked one more question, "What about this  urlLink 'Flash'  stuff? Do I need that too?"

       I watched a good movie last night called  urlLink  Heartbreakers  . It starred Sigourney Weaver and that Jennifer Love Hewitt as mother/daughter grifters, who marry men and bilk them out of large sums of cash. I wasn't expecting much from the movie, in fact I consciously avoided picking it from the local video store on a number of occassions. But yesterday I couldn't find anything at the video store that interested me, so I picked it up by default. What a surprise. It was damn funny, with good performances from Weaver and Gene Hackman as her mark. And Ray Liotta really steals the last half hour of the film. Definitely a windfall for a toss away rental on a Monday night.

       Work starts today on Route 4 in Yona, a mere six years after it was authorized. The entire two lane road just 50 meters from my house will be torn up and replaced with a modern 4 lane highway, with a center turn lane and sidewalks. I am pretty excited about this, the road has been among the worst on Guam for the last couple years. In just the last three months the road has really detiorated, with huge potholes opening up and long stretches were the top layer of pavement has washed off, exposing the road bed. While the traffic will suck on the road for probably the next year, I am looking forward to the construction work. Hopefully a number of people from Talofofo and Inarajan will divert to Cross Island road and lessen the traffic impact.

       I tried to make a  urlLink Mama Tita's  bake-at-home pizza last night. It was not a success. But from bad experiences comes good judgement. I now know that you bake these things with the cardboard base still under the pizza - otherwise the pizza melts through the rack and gets all over the inside of your oven.  It was a disaster, melted and burning pizza everywhere inside my oven. I had a friend over last night to watch a movie and scan some documents, and we both just stared in dismay at the debacle within the oven. We both looked at the mess and said it was a waste, then reached down and started picking half-cooked toppings off the mess.

       On my drive into work this morning I noticed that the smoke was no longer billowing from the landfill. I guess the surface fires are out. Last night the smoke blanketed low areas throughout the area, searing my throat and watering my eyes. The exotic sides of island living.  Speaking of island living, the New York Times has a  urlLink poignant story  about Hawaiians relocating to Las Vegas. The high cost of living on the island is driving many to the desert. Substitute the word Guam for Hawaii, and the article is virtually interchangeable with the situation here in the Marianas. People are leaving in droves for the Mainland, cheaper costs, cheaper housing, and more job opportunities.

       Well after three consecutive losses, my  urlLink fantasy football team  finally won a game this week. I am happy, doubly so since the other two teams in my division that I shared first place with lost to their opponents. That puts me in sole possession of first place in my division, and happy as a clam after a couple good trades this week. I got a solid roster now, and I think I am placed to make a solid run in the last half of the season for a playoff berth. Since the prize is now over $500, I am pretty interested in winning the league.

       The Ordot dump, Guam's only landfill, is on  urlLink fire once again . The whole thing is a terrible situation, Guam's greatest environmental disaster. The landfill should have been closed over a decade ago, but no one has the political will to open a new one. The politicians just  urlLink talk endlessly  about what to do, but never make any  urlLink decisions . The  urlLink EPA  has  urlLink sued GovGuam to close the dump , it regularly catches fires and it's leaking pollutants into the groundwater.  The struggle to close the dump is a  urlLink large ,  urlLink tangled mess . A large part of the problem is the NIMBY effect - "Not In My BackYard." Nobody wants a new landfill near them and no senators are willing to champion the issue for fear of political suicide. A new landfill site was selected on the western end of the island, in a relatively unpopulated area near the Guatali River Valley. However, upon further study most of the land was determined to be on Navy property and not available for GovGuam's use. So that plan is in hiatus.  The other major issue in creating a new landfill is the incinerator debacle.  urlLink The law  mandating the creation of the new landfill includes a section on the creation of an incinerator to burn a large part of the waste material before placing the ashes in the landfill. The government signed a contract with a contractor to build and maintain the incinerator and landfill. The plan was fundamental sound; the incinerator would be a waste to energy generator, supplying much needed electricity from the burning of trash to supplement the island's power needs. However the contract has one major caveat: it stipulates that GovGuam supply a minimum amount of waste for incinerator or else we must pay a fine to the company. Many have pointed out this as a major  urlLink stumbling block  for the finalization of the contract, to say nothing of the protestations about the construction of an incinerator.  Personally I feel the incinerator is a good idea for Guam. It would drastically reduce the amount of waste going into the landfill. Combined with an aggressive  urlLink recycling program  urlLink  , the island's waste troubles could be eliminated. As for the minimum waste clause in the contract, Guam could make arrangements to take the waste from the CNMI, Yap and Palau for a fee to meet the quota. All these islands are also facing a  urlLink landfill crisis , especially  urlLink Saipan . Their dump at Puerto Rico is literally  urlLink falling into the sea  just north of the port. Guam could arrange for contracts to accept the waste from these islands and burn it in our incinerator. I will admit this isn't a perfect solution, but given the realities of modern life I think this is the best possible solution for Guam.   Read the articles I linked to above; many more are available on the web. This is an issue near and dear to everyone on Guam. I woke up this morning with the smell of burning tires for the dump filling my house. I pity the poor souls that actually live next to the festering mass.  On a related trash note, my own personal pile of trash continues to grow outside my house.  urlLink Trash collection is at a virtual standstill , not because of the fire at the dump, but because GovGuam's fleet of trash trucks has been reduced to only 9 out of 35 vehicles. Of course nobody bothered to order replacement parts, or even notify the public until the trash just started piling up. I am luckier than most; my landlady owns a condo with private trash pickup, so we took a couple loads of trash over to that dumpster over the weekend.

       I took a little excursion to the beach today. The fourth  urlLink Micronesian Cup outrigger challenge  was held today the the  urlLink Outrigger Beach Hotel and Resort  in Tumon. While I have lapsed from the paddling routine, I thought it would be good to check out this event. The first Micro Cup was held on Guam in 1999, then it went to Saipan in 2000 and Palau in 2001. Numerous teams from Australia, Hong Kong, Saipan, Palau and Japan are participating in the races, making this a truly international event. This morning was the sprints, the Micro Cup will culminate tomorrow with the open ocean distance race. I think it's going to be a 10 mile race from Boat Basin to Camel Rock, then north along the coast to Hospital Point and back to Boat Basin.

       I got wind of a good deal for travel last night. I was told by a friend at dinner last night that  urlLink Northwest  is offering a special deal for Guam and Saipan residents: $239 round trip to Hawaii plus 20,000 bonus miles; or $199 to Tokyo plus 10,000 bonus miles. I just checked out the  urlLink offer  on Northwest's  urlLink Guam page . The offer is actually Hawaii for $239 and 20,000 frequent flyer miles, or Tokyo for $199 and 10,000 frequent flyer miles. This is still a good offer and I might take them up on the offer, but it certainly isn't as good as what I originally thought.  I really want to get off Guam for Thanksgiving. Hawaii would be nice, but I am itching to get some new stamps in my passport. Maybe that deal to Tokyo; I could spend a few days in Japan. Another possibility is Hong Kong; a good friend of mine will be in Hong Kong for most of November visiting family; She's already suggested I join her for a few days. Last time I was there was 1999, but I seriously doubt  urlLink Continental  is offering any good deals right now. They seem to specialize in applying the screws to Guam residents and wringing every possible dollar out of this region. Ah the joys of a monopoly!  Oh I take that back. Continental is offering a good deal to Manila right now; only $295 round trip. Of course the State Department just issued a travel advisory for US citizens to stay out of the Philippines right now.

       There's this dog I pass everyday on my morning commute. She's old and haggard and doesn't look like she has a lot of life left in her. Everyday she sits in the exact same spot alongside Route 4 in Chalan Pago, watching the traffic pass her by. I first noticed her about four months ago, sitting out there at the end of a driveway. Her fixed stare down the road was a little unnerving.  On Monday this old dog was joined by a new white dog, and a peculiar drama has started to unfold. Traffic Watcher was obviously disturbed by Whitey's appearance; as I hurled past on Monday she was lying in the driveway, barking furiously at this new arrival. I got the sense that she was too old to get up and chase this interloper away. On Tuesday Whitey was there again, this time considerably closer. Traffic Watcher has the quintessential "hang dog" look on her face as she stared not at her beloved traffic, but at this new intruder. Today the new dog was even closer. I fear for Traffic Watcher's future. Will she survive this slow usurpation?

       Yesterday I went online to purchase my tickets for Cairns next month. I was flabbergasted. The price for the ticket tripled in the space of one week. I guess Continental realized that it was a long weekend and people might want to actually travel somewhere. That or they realized people were cancelling their trips to Bali, so they jacked the rate up on the other routes to compensate. I don't know their reasons, but I do know the upshot for me: I'll be sitting at home watching TV Thanksgiving weekend instead of scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef, exploring the Daintree Rainforest or any of the other activities I was looking forward to enjoying. Thanks Continental.  Oh, and needless to say I did not manage a trip to Saipan over the weekend. I worked around the house instead. Maybe I should go to Saipan for Thanksgiving? Maybe for my birthday? We'll see. Continental will probably triple the rates on that route too.

       It's been over a week now since the bombing of the  urlLink Sari Club in Bali . The initial shock has worn off for me. It was unsettling to think that a place I frequented a number of times has been bombed out of existence. I am still dismayed, especially for the Balinese. Such a warm and friendly people, and they are the ones that will suffer the most from this violence.

       I ended up watching  urlLink Spy Games  last night on TV. I sat down with my pizza and came across the beginning of this film on the tube. It was an engaging action thriller.

       Jesus, I am tuckered out. I just spent a really busy afternoon. I water blasted the roof, the upper deck the lower patio and the kitchen porch. Sheesh, put a fork in me, I'm done. Plus I ran errands in the morning to the  urlLink bank , my  urlLink ISP , the auto parts store, and the post office before heading home to work on my car for a couple hours. It just turned 8:00 and I just got in from the yard. Oh yeah, I raked the cut grass into piles of mulch.  Time to eat some pizza, drink a couple beers, read some of my current book,  and listen to  urlLink KPRG  or Radioparadise urlLink  . I was thinking about heading out earlier this afternoon, but I'm too tired right now. And once I get this pizza inside of me, I'll be very loathe to move.  Pizzas ready!

       Well, yesterday was interesting. I visited the optometrist for the first time in almost three years. The verdict? My eyes are still 20/20 and in good shape. The optometrist was curious about the shape of my eye since the LASIK procedure I received in 1999. My record has charts taken at the time of the LASIK that showed my before and after tomographic maps of my eyes. He wanted to check how the current tomography of my eye has changed in the nearly four years since the procedure. Unfortunately, the interface between the tomographic scanner and the computer was not functioning correctly. He promised to have me back once the system is corrected and performing normally.  The final step in the appointment was dilation and a fundus examination. Basically he put numbing drops in my eyes to relax my iris and dilate my eyes wide open. (Just thinking about it right now is making my eyes water.) Once they were dilated fully, he was able to examine the interior of my eye for defects or retinal detachment. The actual examination took just a few minutes; the hard part was the 4 hours afterwards when I couldn't see a damn thing because my eyes were so dilated. I ended up sitting in my office the rest of the afternoon with my sunglasses on, trying to focus on the monitor with little success. Luckily the effects were diminished by about 5:30 and I could safely drive home. I stayed a little later, just so I could avoid driving into the setting sun.

       I left work early yesterday. I wasn't feeling well, and frankly I was worried for my health. I was all woozy and lightheaded, and my heart was racing like crazy. I suspect it was high blood pressure or something. I went home and laid down for about three hours, that cleared it up. Other suggested theories were fatigue or jet lag from the trip, but I suspect the high blood pressure thing. I hate to admit it, but I am in a state of very poor health. It upsets me because I have always been a relatively active fellow. Football, running, hiking, paddling and biking were some of the favorite activities of mine. But I fell into a cycle of despondency and sloth in mid-2000; I stopped paddling, I stopped running, I stopped biking, I found the hikers I was spending time with offensive, so I stopped hiking, and I begged off football because I wasn't in the best shape and had no health insurance. All these things I stopped doing and I just slipped into bad health and increasingly worse shape. Now it's been over two years since I stopped all that stuff and time is catching up with me. I need to rejoin these activities, but I keep procrastinating. Mostly because work sucks the life right out of me; I just want to come home and sleep at night, forget doing anything else. That is the crucial obstacle I need to overcome. More energy, more time.

       Talked to the doctor this morning. I have  urlLink tennis elbow . And it hurts. I need to go looking for some sort of strap to fasten to my elbow to put pressure on the tendon. I'll try K-Mart at lunch and see if they have what I need. If not, then a trip to Cruz Pharmacy should set me up. Either way it's going to be a while before the pain subsides. I was hoping for a shot or something to dull the pain.  After stopping to see the doctor, I paid a quick visit to our Optical department. My sunglasses lost their nose pad during my trip and I needed them repaired. I walked out of there with my sunglasses repaired, and an appointment for tomorrow afternoon with my eye doctor. It's been a few years since my last visit, and I am curious to see what my vision is now. Since the LASIK surgery in '99, I almost forget that I once wore glasses and sunk a large piece of cash into frames every year. Now my visits are occassional, yearly updates and the only glasses I concern myself with are sunglasses.

       On the platter for today:   Stop off at  urlLink Two Lover's Point  and check out an art exhibit at the  urlLink KAHA gallery   Lunch at  urlLink Ban Thai's  excellent buffet  Music at  urlLink Mac & Marti's  this evening, and probably a couple other bars  Now it's time for work though. I feel good. I slept for 10 hours last night; hopefully I am back on Guam time.

       Last night was a bit off bar hopping with the usual cohorts. We finished up at Mac & Marti's, a cigar bar in Tumon. It was my first visit to the place and I enjoyed it. I'll be back for more. Probably on Wednesday actually.  I'm thinking about trying a new selection of bars and clubs from the old habits I've been in lately. Phu's, Toy's and Areebaba's are all good places, but I am a little tired of the Thai girl bar scene. Mac & Marti's, Trades, Santa Fe, and this new place called the Fishbowl are places I am more interested in. Basically all these places feature live music most nights, a relaxed atmosphere, and a bar that sells more than Miller Lite. On the downside, these places usually lack a pool table or dart board, favored diversions of mine.  Last night we all lamented the sad state of bars on Guam compared to the venerable Tahiti Rama and long defunct Signatures. Those were some good watering holes, with real character and many good times.

       For the second week in a row, it looks like my fantasy football team is going down in defeat. That lets all the other mopes in the league catch up and join me in first place. Not cool. Especially since several of my key players are injured and my defense is falling apart. I might be fading heading into the middle of the season. Oh well, my dreams of fantasy glory is dwindling.

       I had this crazy idea to renew my library card at the  urlLink Guam Public Library  yesterday. As always, the pathetic state of the library is enough to elicit tears. I used to have a library card, though I lost it several years ago. Something compelled me to stop off and get a new card. I walked inside and immediately smelled the familiar musty smell inherent it that building. No librarian was on duty at the front desk, which I found curious. I ventured upstairs to the reference desk and found nobody staffing there either. I assumed they were on break, so I just headed into the paltry stacks looking for  Pale Fire , the book I wanted to check out. It wasn't there, but I picked up a worn hardcover copy of  Nabakov's Dozen  and gasped when the pages just fell out of the cover onto the floor. Every book in that library is in a similar state of distress. I think they all date from about 1955 to 1960, probably the last time the library had a budget to acquire books. I wandered to the periodicals section and looked at the magazines, none of which were current issues.I wandered back to the front desk after about 20 minutes and discovered no librarian had appeared. I left without my library card, but with a grim sense of the impending doom that faces this island. The library has been treated like a red-headed stepchild by each successive administration on Guam, and the neglect truly shows. The building is decrepit, the books are crumbling, the magazines are out of date, and the staffing is non-existent. Five one-room branch libraries exist in various villages around Guam, but those are in even worse condition. At this point it would probably make more sense to consolidate all collections and staff at the main library in Hag�t�a. The library is dying a slow death right now, and spreading the sparse collections and staff to man far flung branch offices is not a good solution.

       I was out with some friends last night and I think we made the decision to go to Saipan next weekend. I vaguely recall making that decision. I hope it pans out, a little weekend get-away sounds good to me.  We ended up at this place called Casa last night. I used to frequent that bar in my younger days, but last night was the first time I'd been inside in six years. Still pretty much the same thing, with the same crowd. Only I am older now, and all the girls are younger.

       I made reservations for Cairns, Australia yesterday. I wanted Bali, but the ticket dates were all wrong. Turns out it was a good thing. Bali has been wracked by  urlLink explosions in the last 24 hours , all deliberate terrorist attacks. Dozens are dead, many more are injured. I never thought such a thing would happen in Bali, it is such a peaceful place.

       I returned from a long journey yesterday evening. I enjoyed myself on the trip, that I can't deny. But nothing compares to the feeling of coming home and flopping into your own bed at night. I am glad to be back home, even though it is messy and cluttered. It's my place, a reflection of me.  The flights I took to get here were arduous. Next time I am flying Continental, and I am shooting for seat upgrades to Business First. That 12 hour flight from Los Angeles to Narita is just a killer. The last two hours I was going stir crazy on that airplane. My  daggan  was killing me in that seat. I  hate  flying coach, especially on those chock full flights that  urlLink Northwest  runs between Japan and the States. I'd rather take Continental and layover in Hawaii between 7 and 8 hour flights instead of the mammoth 14 hour run out of Japan. God that sucks.  And to add insult to injury, the return trip to Guam sucked up a week of vacation time. Two overnight layovers, one in Los Angeles and another in Narita. And both times I was too tired to go out and explore - I just took a shower and slept.

       Another dinner out with a former Guam friend. Another evening of bittersweet remembrance.  I just can't stay away from the  urlLink Yardhouse  - tonight was my third visit to one of those establishments. I met Sumiko and her boyfriend Go for dinner in Costa Mesa.  Tomorrow night I leave for St. Louis and the family. Updates will be infrequent for the next week.

       My brother's house is full of love.  I drove through the dusky landscape, through green orchards of avocadoes, across deserts and pine forests. There nestled against a wildlife preserve atop a hill was my brother's house. Inside I found happy children, an expectant mother, and my brother. I met my godson for the first time in almost five years and I felt the awful isolation, the price I have paid for my life in the islands. I was amongst my family, blood of my blood, and I could see how much I missed living across the abyssal sea.  It was a bittersweet farewell to that family. I hope I get the chance to visit more often.

       Last night my friend  urlLink Dianne  hosted a memorial service for her late husband Ron. She convened about 17 friends together at the  urlLink Fish Eye Marine Park  in Piti to view the underwater observatory and enjoy the dinner buffet and show. Ron and his company provided the environmental impact study for the observatory that was crucial in getting the project approved, so Dianne thought it fitting to get together there. The observatory is located in the largest of the Piti Bomb Holes, pockets of deep water within the reef offshore of the village of Piti. Local legend attributes their creation to bombs dropped in World War II, but the bomb holes are actually the remains of collapsed caves, similar to Shark's Hole north of Tanguisson Beach. The observatory, which looks like a flying saucer hovering above the water, is reached by a long causeway above the reef flat. Once inside, a spiral staircase descends twenty feet below the waves to the observation deck. Large porthole windows located around the circumference allow for viewing the fish, shrimp, sponges and anemones in their natural habitat.  After convening at the observatory and watching the sunset, our group migrated back to the the main building on shore. This building houses a gift shop, several large aquariums, the buffet dinner and the  urlLink Polynesian dancing show . The food was onolicious, a tantalizing seafood buffet, complete with sushi and sashimi. Once we ate our fill, the show began. The dancing was great, and it was like visiting an old friend. The show, the musicians, the performers, the entire act was lifted from the venerable Tahiti Rama beach bar in Tumon. Tahiti Rama was the quintessential beach bar in Guam, a favorite watering hole and destination for many years. They had a great island dance show on Friday nights for a couple years, highlighted by Tana's fire dance and the owner's guitar playing and running commentary. Several years ago Tahiti Rama was leveled by hotel expansion in Tumon and I always wondered what happened to the owner and his great Polynesian show. Well he relocated to  urlLink Fish Eye . And the show is better than ever.

       My first Thanksgiving dinner was a rousing success. Just a few friends and neighbors came over and enjoyed the deep fried turkey, and everyone was amazed at how good the bird actually tasted. Tender and juicy, no oily taste at all. I am actually frying another bird this evening for some more friends.  Besides the food, the company was excellent. A small group convened at my house and we spent the day playing backgammon, drinking, talking and taking some pictures. The party kicked up a notch in the evening with the addition of a couple more people, one providing some herbal entertainment. I don't think the party really died down until two in the morning. I'm not exactly sure though, I got tired at 1:30 and went to sleep. Some folks were still up.  Looking back, this was definitely my best Thanksgiving since 1999, and a great way to kick off the holiday season.

       Allow me to wish you and yours a happy Thanksgiving, full of family, friends and fine food.  Looks like I will be hosting the holiday festivities at my place today. Fine with me, it's going to be a low-key affair anyway. I'm frying up a turkey, making some Stove-Top stuffing, a loaf of bread, and some brownies. I ain't sure what other people are bringing. I might toss up a salad too, I need to use up the rest of those greens before they go bad. Should be a pretty good spread.

       This morning I got to thinking that it has been ten years since I shared Thanksgiving with anyone in my family. That got me thinking about where I was for each Thanksgiving since I left St. Louis in 1987 for Beloit. There's a couple I don't exactly recall, the one in 1991 and the one in 1988   1987 - First from Beloit, drove to Chicago with Curtis Meyer, then down to St. Louis. Rigged the lights for  urlLink Vianney's  Fall Theater production.  1988 - Thanksgiving in Chicago with Nancy & CJ. Got a ride with Suss in his van, and it lost a wheel near the  urlLink Belvedere Oasis . Spent hours at that oasis waiting for his dad to come rescue us. Nancy was terribly worried about my late arrival.  1989 - Thanksgiving in Chicago with Nancy & CJ, met CJ's proteg� Helen. Jem Ripley gave me a ride in his '67 Mustang. Met his folks in Skokie, then drove down to Oak Park.  1990 - Thanksgiving in Chicago with Nancy & CJ, in their new home. Took the bus this time.  1991 - I honestly don't remember. Maybe it was in Farmington at Gary's?  1992 - Went to Elgin, IL for the family get together at Rick & Karen's. It was a tense weekend. I wasn't happy in grad school, and my journey from Columbia to Chicago was via just about every back road and highway I could find. The entire weekend could be summed up as creepy.  1993 - First Thanksgiving in Guam, ate dinner with Chris, James, Tillie and her family. Gave thanks that I was on a beautiful island.  1994 - The Best Thanksgiving Ever. Beachside in Tamuning with David, Jenny, Brad and Craig. We had a bonfire on the beach after sunset, then all ended up at my place, content and sleepy.  1995 - Turkey with the Goldbergs at Alupang Condos. First tasted Jason Goldbergs sweet potato souffl� - wow.  1996 - Mid-afternoon turkey dinner with Jason Goldberg and his friends off Mamis Street in Tamuning. This was a bunch of Sandcastle dancers, I remember that vividly.  1997 - The season of many turkeys. Ate a killer meal at Mel & Craig's place in Agana Heights, turkey with all the trimmings. Everything done up like Martha Stewart. Then off to Tamuning for another meal with Craig, Darren and Cindy. I was hurting by the end of the night.  1998 - Started with a mid-afternoon meal with David and the Tobi boys in Mangilao, then more turkey at the Koon's place atop Nimitz Hill.  1999 - Arrived back from Bali in the morning, then spent the evening with Mel & Craig. The infamous turkey carcass  urlLink congee  with Annie.  2000 - House sitting for Mel & Craig, Annie was staying there as well. She went somewhere in Tumon, I was under the weather and moped around. I don't think I even ate turkey that day.  2001 - Kim & Suzanne hosted a dinner at their place, Cyrus & Jen, Steve & Katie and several other people were there. I fried a turkey! And it was good.  2002 - Looks like I am hosting the party this year for a few friends. I am frying another turkey of course, those things are 'da bomb!'

       Just a quick one, the latest dish on a couple stories featured in the  urlLink PDN :    Airport Expenses Audited  - The public auditor last week revealed the results of an audit of the Guam International Airport spending habits.  urlLink Her results ? In 1999, the board of directors approved $97,382 in travel expenses. At the end of 1999, Gov. Carl Gutierrez released a secret memo, relieving the board of this oversight duty and giving full approval for expenditures with his appointed director, Gerry Yingling. During 2000 and 2001, the expenses soared to over $1,000,000 dollars, including over 150 trips for the governor, over 70 trips for the first lady, and expenses for  strip clubs ,  lap dances , plane tickets for family members,  urlLink health club memberships ,  urlLink massages  and other questionable items. This is the exact same thing that happened over a year ago at the  urlLink Guam   urlLink Mass   urlLink Transit   urlLink Authority   urlLink and  other  urlLink GovGuam agencies . The incoming governor  urlLink vows this will not happen .  [Yeah, right. Though Felix Camacho was the one spearheading the GMTA investigation. Maybe there is hope...]    urlLink  Archdioceses Buys Hotel   - The Archdioceses of Guam purchased the hotel across from my house on Ylig Bay. The Accion was a horrendous failure as a hotel. The Church plans to convert the property into a seminary and retreat center.  [Better a seminary than another hotel. This is a great idea, and the Church picked the place up for a steal.]    urlLink  GovGuam Revenues Plummet   - No surprise here. Thousand laid off, spending less and less, the deparment of Revenue & Taxation announced that 2002 receipts were down 27% from 2001. And things were already bad in 2001. That's bad.  [Unless you happen to have a goverment agency credit card...]

       I can get used to this. I think I am actually more productive working from home. It's been non-stop since 8:00 this morning, and I am not tired or cranky. Usually I have a serious headache by this time of the day, but that's not happening. I am sitting at my computer and working diligently, but I am also listening to  urlLink Monday Night Football  on the television. I worked through my lunch, and I ain't even suffering from the mid-afternoon siesta urge. This is cool. I wonder if I can get away with this more often?

       Today I am working from home. It's not bad. No morning commute, I can listen to the radio as loud as I want, I'm sitting here in shorts and t-shirt. This telecommuting thing is a good idea. I should try and do it more often.  Unfortunately, this pleasure of home bound work is due to automobile problems. Funny, I think my Isuzu knows I am thinking about getting a new vehicle. This morning I had a flat tire. Well not completely flat, but very low. I could probably head out and stop at the gas station a 1/2 mile up the road. I started up the engine and heard an ungodly racket. I think my clutch is burned up, and I can think of no better reason to buy a new car. The damn thing is just falling apart in front of my very eyes.  Perhaps the reason a new car has been on my mind lately was because I subconsciously suspected my vehicle was near death? The mind is a powerful thing, perhaps my unconscious knew something the rational mind didn't comprehend. That could be, but it's really a combination of factors:   No air conditioning in the Amigo  The extreme susceptibility of the soft top to theft and the elements  The age of my Isuzu - 14 years and counting  The brakes need work  The clutch needs to be replaced  The crappy fuel economy of the SUV  The rust that has literally exploded throughout the body in the last year  I guess all these factors combined add up to a new car for Tom. Probably the main impetus for auto replacement is the robbery three weeks ago. That was the third time the Isuzu was broken into, and I am just sick of it. I want a secure automobile, with air conditioning, that runs well, and gets good mileage. The urge is growing. I guess I'll spend the weekend auto shopping in earnest. And getting the Amigo fixed.

       Last night I made another delicious  urlLink crock pot  meal. This time I dropped  urlLink Angus beef  boneless rib fingers into the crock pot, poured in a couple cans of stewed tomatoes, some mushrooms, a can of pinto beans, an onion and lots of fresh  urlLink rosemary . When I got home last night the house was filled with the divine aroma of  urlLink rosemary . While the beef was okay, the broth was incredible. The rosemary infused the tomatoes and it was amazing. I was happy to just dip my home made onion bread in the juice and eat that for dinner.  There's quite a number of  urlLink sites  devoted to  urlLink crock pot   urlLink recipes . I am  urlLink intrigued  and look forward to trying some of these  urlLink culinary creations . I also dug up an  urlLink interesting recipe  for rib fingers. Since I love Thai food, this has just become a future menu item.

       A couple things to celebrate today: I got my ATM card and checks in the mail today, thanks  urlLink Bankoh ! Now I can have cash in my pocket again. Alleluia! To commemorate this fine day, I am going to eat lunch at  urlLink Carmen's  today.  On the down side I got a phone call early Friday morning from  urlLink American Express . Somehow, I am not sure how, my $10 payment to them last month bounced. I could have sworn that check cleared before I closed the old checking account. Anyway, I had to send off a check this morning to Amex for the $10 plus $29 penalty fee. That just chaps my hide. They even went so far as to deactivate that card account until the problem is cleared up.

       I've always tried to avoid Wal-Marts when I go shopping in the states, primarily because for personal reasons; I abhor the cultural vacuity of those giant megastores. Now I've found an good  urlLink article  that validates my choice: Wal-Mart is evil. Anti-union, forced labor, low wages, no health benefits. That's what drives those low low prices that the American consumer craves, the exploitation and degradation of thousands of people. Henceforth, I shall shop at Wal-Mart no more.

       A chilling  urlLink article  on  urlLink Salon  today  (requires a Salon subscription.)  One thing occurred to me as I read the article; if such an attack occurred on a commercial airliner, it would be a tremendous blow. In the past year I've often heard how al-Qaida seeks to turn back the clock, bring back the middle ages and Islamic supremacy. Crippling the airline industry would be a major step in that direction.

       Finally - and here's what on deck for me:    The 2003 Auto Show at Micronesia Mall  - I am looking around for a new car, and this auto show should provide me with a good chance to check out a number of models, take some test drives and make comparisons.   The Laramie Project at UOG  - Grim little play about Matthew Shepard's murder in 1998 that is being put on by UOG students this weekend. Shows Friday and Saturday night. $5 admission. Beats watching TV.   Boonie Stomp  - I don't know if I'll make the hike to Sigua Falls with DPR's group tomorrow, but I'll take a stab at it. At least I should hike to Tarzan Falls, my default hike when I can't think of anywhere else to go. Maybe I'll take the dogs too.   DVD's  - I got a couple DVD's I need to watch, that ought to keep me busy. Mainly  urlLink Croupier , I need to watch that.

       That describes the last 24 hours.  urlLink Tropical Storm Haishen  has certainly raised a  urlLink ruckus on Guam . Strong gusts of wind and driving rain lasted until this sunrise this morning. I lost a large plastic Rubbermaid container that housed my scuba gear to the high winds. It overturned last night spilling my equipment across the lanai before rocketing into the railing and breaking into several pieces. Wow. The surf was immense this morning in Ylig Bay, and huge waves were crashing into the cliffs north of Pago Bay. Pretty cool stuff.

         The PDN continues to turn up more dirt on school board member and convicted felon  urlLink Jonathan Toves . Toves was arrested in 1999 for impersonating a public health inspector and extorting money from island businesses. However the case was never brought to trial when the prosecuting attorney left the Attorney General's office and no one picked up the case.  [I heard about this months ago - from another friend of mine that works at an island bakery and called Public Health about this scam. I am betting this guy just got himself elected into another criminal charge - hopefully the AG's office will reassign the case to another lawyer.]    The imbroglio over the smoldering Ordot Dump continues:   Monday brought  urlLink rumors of a settlement  offer to make a lawsuit against Guam Resource Recovery Partners (GRRP) disappear.  The rumors were  urlLink vehemently denied  by Governor Carl Gutierrez, who laid blame for the situation at the feet of several legislators.  The Ordot landfill fire was  urlLink finally put out .  Lawmakers met this week to discuss  urlLink closing Ordot . The Department of Public Works estimates  urlLink $2.7 million  is needed to close the facility.   [This landfill crisis has gone on long enough. The Ordot landfill is literally a mountain of trash now. This environmental disaster needs to be the primary focus of the incoming administration and legislature.]     urlLink Another good piece  on Bali from Guam ex-pat Pamela Tibbs.  [My heart is aching for Bali right now. The Balinese are suffering as a result of the October bombings, events that were largely beyond their control. I can think of nowhere on earth as special as Bali, and it pains me to think of what is in store for the island.]    A new U.S. Attorney was nominated by George W. Bush. urlLink Leonardo Rapadas  will replace Fred Black as the U.S. Attorney. A date for the change has not been set, since the nomination must be approved by the Senate first.  [Mr. Black has done an excellent job as U.S. Attorney, let's hope Mr. Rapadas will continue his excellent work. Rapadas worked on several high profile cases, so hopefully he won't shy away from the government corruption and graft cases that have been Black's forte.]

       A tropical depression is skirting Guam today. The winds are  urlLink gusty , about 30 to 40 knots. Tropical Depression  urlLink Haishen  is expected to bypass Guam, but still upset the weather around the island. All my patio furniture is skittering around outside, and leaves and branches are scattered across the lawn.  My plans for Friday are shot, but I still think I'll take the afternoon off tomorrow. It's been a tough week. I was really frazzled when I got home last night. I needed some bourbon, a couple beers, and a nap to calm down.

       Stargazing was a bust last night. I woke a little before 2:00 a.m. and went outside to discover thick milky clouds, suffused with silvery light from the lambent moon. I stayed outside for 45 minutes and saw nary a star the entire time. When I went back in and laid down to sleep, slumber eluded me. So I vacillated between sitting outside, hoping for a fortuitous break in the clouds, and surfing the 'net. I finally drifted off to a fitful rest around 5:30 a.m. Never saw a single shooting star. I think that makes it four years in a row that the Leonids disappointed me.

       The  urlLink Leonids  will reach peak intensity over Guam  urlLink tomorrow  morning before  urlLink sunrise . I just poked my head outside and much to my dismay I couldn't see a single star. The haze and moonshine are too great. Hopefully things will improve overnight.  This year's  urlLink predictions  are not favorable for Guam and the Western Pacific, but I will keep my fingers crossed.  Clear skies and look for updates tomorrow morning!

       I promised a couple weeks ago to avoid mentioning the recent elections; but I really need to point out a recent development.  The PDN is suddenly  urlLink starting  a  urlLink crusade   urlLink against  a  urlLink convicted felon  that was  urlLink elected  to the newly created  urlLink school board . While the newspaper's efforts are to be commended, this reflects a serious lapse in the media's role as a watchdog for the public trust. This information was readily available; it was known to the Guam Election Commission, which requires police clearance before a candidate can file for office; it was in the public record at the courts; it was know by numerous island residents who suffered at this man's expense, but no mention of his past was made in the newspaper or other island media. Even I knew about his record, just from a casual conversation with a friend that was the victim of this crook's fraud.  For crying out loud, the guy has two social security numbers and goes by an alias. Yet he says he is reformed, a changed man that wants to make a difference for his island.  Particularly galling is the revelation that this felon is scheduled to go on trial in 2003 for criminal sexual conduct. This man, a known thief, convicted for writing  bad checks , is overseeing of our school system. Wonderful. And due to an oversight in the legislation creating the school board, it is perfectly legal for him to sit on this board. I find this development disturbing. How could this happen?

       There's a  urlLink good article  in today's PDN on soil erosion and the losing battle environmentalists are engaged in with "hunters." Several acres of reforested acacia trees were incinerated by these hunters looking for the easy kill. Poachers intentionally set fires to burn away ground cover; the idea being that sprouting young grasses attract deer to the open area, making them sitting ducks. The reality is the fires burn off trees and bushes, expose the soil to erosion, strain the water treatment facilities, and destroy the coral reefs with sedimentation. Particularly galling is the fact that these trees were planted by schoolchildren, only to have adults come in and negate all the hard work.  This is just another symptom of over population and poverty on the island. Too many people are straining the infrastructure and despoiling the natural resources of the island. Too many people trying to feed their families by hunting and fishing. It's the same mindset that's found in the degradation of the reefs. In fact, I am willing to say the very same guys that set these fires also use  urlLink scuba to strip mine  the fish off the reefs.

       Once again Stephen Davis has decided to be feeb. 19 carries, 59 yards, no touchdowns. The guy is worthless, I don't know why I start the fool. However Michael Vick is the bomb, posting impressive numbers for the fifth week in a row. And I finally seem to have hit upon a solid corps of wide receivers in Chad Johnson and Donald Driver.  Unfortunately it looks like my opponent this week will best me due to a solid performance from Jeff Garcia and James Thrash.  The league has become serious now that the season is coming down to the wire. The pot is over $600 now, that's a serious amount of change. And since it looks like I won't be receiving my tax refund this year, I can use the additional income.

       I signed up for  urlLink Netflix  at the end of October. Netflix sends three dvd's to my house via the mail and I can keep them as long as I like. When finished I post them back to Netflix in the supplied prepaid envelope, and Netflix will send me another movie off my rental queue. I was a little worried about the turnaround time since I live in Guam, but I am pleasently surprised by the speedy delivery. I sent back my first movie on Monday and I got the delivery notice for my next movie this morning. Not bad.  I don't think Netflix will replace  urlLink Blockbuster  or 3V's, my corner videostore. But it is a good option for older movies, independent films, and foreign movies. The stuff that never makes it to Guam's theaters, or Guam's video stores. I already watched  Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down!  and  Croupier , both films that I have never seen on Guam. Netflix even has a selection of really old films. Fritz Lang's  Metropolis  is on my rental queue, and a couple Buster Keaton films.  Netflix only offers dvd's for rent, another indication of the impending obsolesence of VHS tapes. I like dvd's, the quality is far superior to videotape, but I am concerned about the susceptibility of the discs to scratches. I've already rented several discs that were unwatchable due to skips and errors. When I mentioned dvd's to my sister the librarian, she mentioned how disgusted she was with the technology for the exact same reason. She prefers to purchase videotapes for her library because the tapes are virtually indestructible.

       I finished  Riverhorse  last Sunday, in a final push to the conclusion. Much like Least Heat-Moon's drive to reach the Pacific, I was determined to finish the book that day. It was nearly an obsession. I enjoyed the book; a nice, fluffy piece of literature. It just wasn't on the same caliber of  Blue Highways . It felt strangely hollow and left me without much empathy for the adventurers across the American waterways. Or perhaps is was the long traverse of the Missouri to its headwaters that wore me out. I just didn't care by the end of that section.  I took a few days off of reading and watched the television instead. Nothing like a little dose of the godbox suck all discomfort and cognitive thought from my mind. But television is best taken in small doses. By last night I found myself flipping back and forth between one of those half hour commercials for a set of knives and Junkyard Wars. That's when it struck me, there are better ways to kill some time. I turned off the flickering blue light and picked up a book. Or actually two.   I just started Harold Bloom's  How To Read And Why,  a book that  urlLink Dianne  passed along to me. I didn't get past the introduction last night, but it looks promising. Snippets of short stories, novels and poetry, along with Bloom's analysis of the writing style.  I also started reading  The Return of the Native  in earnest. I actually downloaded Thomas Hardy's novel from the  urlLink Gutenberg Project  a couple months ago, and put it on my  urlLink Psion . I find the Psion makes a convenient e-book reader; I've read several books on it now, all downloaded from Gutenberg. I started  The Return of the Native  several weeks ago, but I haven't really made the commitment to dive into the novel. That changed last night, when I powered out four chapters before falling asleep. It's been years since I read anything by Hardy, and I found it much more enjoyable than my last attempt.  So suddenly I am engrossed in two books, along with several month's worth of magazines that piled up in my absence. I guess my reading docket it full for the foreseeable future. I still want to finish a couple major novels before the end of the year, specifically  Les Miserables  and  Gravity's Rainbow . This will not be easily accomplished, both are dense works. The bookshelf  sags under the weight of both books, but they taunt me. I will conquer them soon.  I was looking over my book lists for the last couple years and I noticed that I usually read a book series every year in December or January.  The Alexandria Quartet , the  Harry Potter  books, and  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . I guess I need to make a decision about what to read for this year's series installment. Perhaps  The Lord of the Rings , it's been over ten years since I read those seminal books of my childhood.

        urlLink Continental  is offering a great vacation package deal to Bali right now. Only $399 for hotel and airfare. I guess the Lord provides - Bali is where I originally wanted to go for Thanksgiving and now the opportunity has arisen.  When I mentioned my plan to a couple people, their reaction was incredulous. "Why would you go there? It's not safe with the bombing." I wonder if people made that statement about New York City last year. To me, Bali is one of the safest, friendliest places on the planet. I was shocked and dismayed at the bombing last month. I've been to the Sari Club a number of times. But will I feel unsafe in Bali? Not in the least.  The terrible thing about the bombing is the disaster it has wrought upon the Balinese. There was a letter to the editor of today's PDN,  urlLink "Bali Cries,"  which describes how the people of Bali are terrified that this terrorist attack will destroy their tourism industry and the livelihoods of most of the population.

       The truth is  urlLink finally out : GovGuam does not have the money to pay out 2001 tax refunds. I totally expected this development. For ten years, Guam has not had the money to pay tax returns. The last four years my refund checks arrived around Halloween, and I make it a point to file my tax return extremely early - usually the first or second week of February. Needless to say I have not received my refund check yet, and I do not expect to find it in my mailbox anytime soon. This is not a new problem, it happens all the time here. I remember Carl Gutierrez floating a loan in 1995 to pay out the refunds - the checks were distributed at the dog track of all places.

       I just got back from the lectures at  urlLink UOG ,  Conflict Mediation/"Why do they hate us so much?" . I enjoyed this week's presentations more than last week, the topics were broader and the discussion afterwards touched on a great many valid points. The audience presented an interesting round of discussion. A particularly powerful comment was made by a woman that had dual citizenship in Canada and the United States. She spoke about how her 24 year old son was in Belgium on 9/11 and he called her from a pay phone. He was in absolute shock and dismay, but not at the destruction in New York. He was distraught over the public gloating, cheering and applause the destruction elicited from the Belgian populace watching the horror unfold on the television. He was appalled to discover that not everyone loved the United States and Americans. Interesting evening.  When I got home I was greated with the smell of freshly baked bread and savory stew. The bread machine is a great invention, but the humble  urlLink crock pot  is truly a wondrous thing. Toss some meat, carrots, potatoes, onions and liquid into the slow cooker in the morning, come home to a tasty meal. I was always skeptical about crock pots in the past, but the things are a real time saver. And the stew is delicious over a thick slice of  fresh pesto bread. Wow.

       Tonight is the second installment of a four week lecture series at UOG,  Reflections on 9/11 . The lectures focus on Islam and its often uneasy relationship with the Western World. I attended last week's lecture on  Women and Islam/Human Rights in the Islamic World  and it was fascinating.  6:00 - 8:00 p.m. at the CAS Lecture Hall. I'll take notes.

       Looks like the supplemental draft last week and the trade for  urlLink Jamal Lewis  really helped out my  urlLink team . I am currently winning against Gerry with a comfortable 30 point lead. All my players are finished, but Gerry's got two players in the late Sunday game. I am not worried about Gerry's tight end, but his placekicker  urlLink Olindo Mare , can put up some points. And since the league has these crazy rules that vastly inflate a kicker's value for long field goals, I could still lose.  The biggest news of the week was a rather contentious trade between the two cellar dwellers of the league. It sparked a heated flurry of emails when the votes looked uncertain - lots of accusations and name calling. I think a lot of bad blood came to the surface. I was just amazed at how nasty the messages got by Friday. Chill out dudes, it's  Fantasy Football , not real life. I guess some guys place a lot of machismo into their team's performance. I like to win, but it ain't that important to me.

       I got my Psion back. None the worse for it's misadventure. I am happy again. It won't totally erase the bad memory of the crime, but it was the major article I was upset over losing. Now that it's back I think my life can get back to normal.  The fellow that had my Psion was a good man. We chatted for a bit, then he hit me up for a job. He's looking for work. I told him I would try to find him something at my job, but times were tough. He looked so pathetic, out of place. Lost. I will try and see if I can do anything for him. I owe him a debt, and I must repay him.

       Is there anytime of the week as enjoyable as a Sunday morning? I don't think so. Sure Friday night is good, but I don't go out as much as I used to, so my Friday nights are pretty tame these days. Saturday mornings are usually filled with activities, either paddling, hiking, biking, or chores around the house. No time to relax on Saturday.  Sunday mornings are special.  urlLink KPRG  airs some great programs then, including  urlLink St. Paul Sunday Morning  and  urlLink Selected Shorts . I can relax, read the  urlLink Sunday paper , listen to the radio and just chill. I often make a nice breakfast, either an omelet or poached eggs, something out of the ordinary Grape Nuts and orange juice routine. The morning seems special somehow, especially since Sunday afternoon usually lets me down. And Sunday evening is always tinged with the realization that Monday morning means a return to the office and the hassles of the workaday world. But Sunday morning is that delightful moment between the stress of last week and the dread of the coming week when I feel completely at ease.

       I don't really play video games often. I don't know why, I used to be a fiend for the old console systems, especially my Intellivision. But after college I guess real life intruded into my gaming world and my interest waned. I still play a few games, but they are not the time sink that my old obsession used to be.  I own a  urlLink Dreamcast , but I play it rarely. I don't really play many sports games, but I developed a fondness for  urlLink Star Wars: Episode 1 Racer . I also really enjoyed  urlLink Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation  and  urlLink MDK2 . But that is about it. I am currently playing  urlLink Shenmue , if taking a year to get only partly into the game is actually playing.  My PC video games are even sparser. I can remember playing  urlLink Doom , but only a few games appeal to me. I still play the original  urlLink Descent , and occasionally  urlLink Diablo , but that's about it. I'm playing  urlLink Deus Ex  on my PC, but that's playing like Shenmue is playing - not really.  When I was younger I had a  urlLink Mattel Intellivision , and I actually played that a great deal. Well into the evening I would toil away on my favorite games, especially  urlLink Dungeons & Dragons ,  urlLink Night Stalker  and  urlLink Tron: Deadly Discs . And the sports games were really cool. I like Soccer and Baseball the most. But eventually I grew tired of the games and quit playing most of the time.  In college I spent a great deal of time with  urlLink Nintendo , but so did everyone else. The games were good and while I never owned a NES, I grew proficient in a number of games.  urlLink Tecmo Bowl  anyone? Contra? The  urlLink Legend of Zelda ? It was probably just the college life, but I can distinctly remember all night video game rallies, usually starting around 1:00 or 2:00 when the bars closed, and lasting until dawn. Those empty hours wasted in front of the flickering television marked some of the indelible memories of my college career.  After those college years my game playing withered away, playing just a few games a year. I just found the games a colossal waste of time - a veritable black hole sucking free time. On the rare occasions I did get immersed in a game, it absorbed my time almost completely. Doom did this, the first Tomb Raider did this, Diablo did this. But this only occurs about once every couple years. I'd rather just spend my free time reading books.  Oh, I guess I'm blathering about this since I just spent a couple hours blowing stuff up in Descent. I first bought this game back in '95 and I still enjoy flying around shotting like a maniac. I spent a few months designing new levels with a level editor back in the day. That's too much effort for me now. My levels were invariably boring and not very challenging, maybe because I knew where everything was. Anyway, it's been a fun little trip down memory lane playing this game again.

       A couple days ago I had very little faith in the human race. The random act of petty crime and the hassles it put me through put me in a very dark mood. I scowled and grumbled at every body that came near me. A natural reaction I guess, but not one that made me feel any better. Just another of my increasingly common black moods, most of them directed towards life on Guam.  I just got off the phone with this guy who bought my  urlLink Psion  off a kid for $50. He was concerned that the PDA might be stolen when he found my name, number and personal information stored on the machine. I told him it was and we made arrangements to meet tomorrow afternoon and make the exchange. It was refreshing to speak to a complete stranger calling me out of the blue to do a good deed. He could very well have just kept the Psion and not said anything, but he made the choice to do the right thing. This small act of kindness has done a great deal in restoring my faith in mankind. Perhaps we aren't all damned after all.

       I just realized the thief made off with a CD-RW that contained a great deal of business information. Crap. The only comfort I have is that the CD was a DirectCD and it wasn't closed - therefore only a CD-RW drive with DirectCD could read the data on that disk. The sense of violation and vulnerability just gets worse.

       I just spent a good portion of the morning covering my ass. Since my checkbook was stolen, I walked to the  urlLink Bank of Hawaii  to cancel those checks. Bankoh wanted to charge me $20 per check for each stop payment - for thirty checks! It was cheaper and wiser to just close the checking account and open a new one. But now I need new checks, a new ATM card and other sundries to get my life back into order, a process that's going to take at least two weeks.  I don't think the loss of the Psion will be that damaging - the only really sensitive information was a list of internet passwords and that was an encrypted file. The only thing that concerned me was a note I made with my long distance PIN code. I changed that this morning with one phone call.  I have a tremendous urge to stake out those crummy apartments across from where I was eating last night and pummel the first kid I see walking around with any of my stuff in his possession. The hassle is something just I don't need right now.

       My car was broken into last night while I was eating dinner at a Thai restaurant. I went around and asked some people that live in the area, and I am pretty sure it was a little kid. Whoever it was didn't take my stereo, though they did take my ashtray which had some change in it. The thief also grabbed my bag from the floor of the passenger seat. The bag had my checkbook and my  urlLink Psion . I'm not worried about the checks, I'll get those cancelled today. But the loss of the Psion just sucks. I had a great deal of my life stored on that machine. A lot of information and tools I use at work were stored on that gizmo. Any confidential information on the PDA was in password protected files, but it just makes me uneasy that the thing is in somebody else's hands. It just ticks me off to no end. There's a sense of violation, and anger at somebody that would steal something of no use to them, just for the sake of stealing. Oh and I just remembered - the thief got my dirty Tupperware and a hard to find grapefruit spoon that were in my bag from lunch. Damn!

       Monday's PDN contained an excellent  urlLink article  about expats living in Bali, and their reactions to the Sari Club bombing in Kuta. I've often thought of staying in Bali for an extended period; to read, paint, decompress. The idea that I should go to Bali and help address the problems crept into my mind yesterday and I ruminated on it all of yesterday. A life of service in Bali - couldn't do much better if you ask me.

       Today, at long last, is the general election. On the ballot are a number of races:    Governor/Lt. Governor  This hotly contested race is between  urlLink Bob Underwood / urlLink Tom Ada  (D) and  urlLink Felix Camacho / urlLink Kaleo Moylan  (R). A couple months ago, I'd say Underwood was the likely victor, but now I'd put the chances at 50/50. Recently the campaign has become vindictive, with a great many attack ads running on television and radio. This is a new development on Guam, and not a welcome development. Throwing a great deal of rancor into the race, the other Democratic candidate from September's primary has not endorsed Underwood, and many of her supporters are now sporting Camacho/Moylan signs and showing up at the Republican rallies. I just don't understand that, sure they were opponents, but they're still Democrats, and they should have the same goals.   1 Congressional Seat for the U.S. House of Representatives  This race is between  urlLink Madeline Bordallo  (D) and  urlLink Joe Ada  (R). Bordallo is the current Lt. Governor, and Ada is a Guam Senator and former Governor. This race is for the seat Rep. Underwood is vacating for his gubernatorial bid.    urlLink 15 seats for the Guam Legislature   There are 30 candidates running for all 15 seats in the territorial legislature. None of the 15 senators elected today actually represent a district; they represent all of Guam, and any citizen can appeal to any senator for aid and support. Until a few years ago the legislature had 21 senators, a remarkable number for an island with only 150,000 people.   Attorney General  The contest for the first elected attorney general has been heated, especially between  urlLink Phil Tydingco  and  urlLink Doug Moylan . The other candidates are former senator  urlLink Don Parkinson and  urlLink Elisabeth Cruz .   9 seats for the  urlLink school board   After several false starts, this year marks the first time an elected school board will have a say about the island's detiorating public schools. An elected board was authorized several years ago, but the governor disbanded the board after the elections in '98, and hardly any candidates filed in 2000. This year however a number of people are running for the posts. It will be interesting to see what this board will do about the deplorable conditions of Guam's schools.   5 seats for the  urlLink Public Utilities Commission   This race confuses me. I understand the purpose, to create an oversight committee for power and water services with the power to appoint general managers for each agency. What I don't understand is why so many people want the job. Over 25 candidates are running for five seats. And the post only pays $1,000 a month for a two year term. What's the attraction? Political stepping stone, civic pride, or a cushy job and an easy $12,000 a year? Got me...  I plan on hitting the polls this afternoon. The crowds outside the polling places are immense, and a general party atmosphere pervades the entire proceedings. Tents, balloons, beer, bbq, a few fistfights, chanting from one contingent to the next - Guam has a unique and exciting election day tradition. At the very least, it gets people to the polls. Voter turnout is usually above 60%, and probably more for this election. I think it's the free food. I know I'll be eating bbq for dinner tonight, courtesy of some candidate.

       The PDN has an  urlLink excellent article  today on the  urlLink US Department of Fish & Wildlife's  decision to designate 25,000 acres of Guam as critical habitat for several endangered species. That amounts to 19% of the island, and the move has met with fierce opposition by Chamorro activists, the Government of Guam. It is interesting to note Fish & Wildlife did not want to designate the land as critical habitat, but was forced into the action by several  urlLink lawsuits  levied against the agency by  urlLink environmental groups . The situation is full of bad blood, and the article does a great job of describing the events, players and issues involved.

       Just one day before the  urlLink election  and the campaigns have reached a fever pitch. Islandwide rallies were held by both gubernatorial candidates yesterday, and the roads were clogged with caravans of music blaring, horn honking, flag waving supporters on their way to their respective camps in Hag�t�a. The caterwaul continued for most of the afternoon, an unfortunate problem with the location of my home. I get the noise coming up the hill from Ylig Bay, then again on the other side as the highway wraps around my house. Double whammy.  Meanwhile, the  urlLink landfill continues  to smolder and fume, but the governor has not authorized the emergency spending to combat the blaze. Can anyone say "lame duck?"

       I ticked myself off with my trip to K-Mart today. I purchased three things at the store, for a total of $11. Not much. Just three things. I got home to stow all the goodies from my shopping adventure, and only one of the things I bought at K-Mart made it home. The other two I must have left at the store. Damn. I was looking forward to working on the crossword puzzles in the little book too.

And the music is just what I like to listen to.  One of the benefits of internet radio; no commercials, and especially no political ads. I can't stand the damn things. I'll be happy when the election is finally over and done with.

       Work proved a mighty irritant yesterday, and I was happy to leave a little before 5:00 pm. The last couple days were pretty stressful for me and this coming week offers no respite. Thankfully it was a pay day, always a cause for celebration.  I met up with my friend David at  urlLink Santa Fe on the Bay , a funky little hotel with a beach bar. We talked with  urlLink Travis Kloppenburg  for a while, and then it was off on a quest for a new and entertaining bar. Somehow I always seem to end up in the same old places though.  A three hour shopping trip this morning netted me a refrigerator full of fresh vegetables and fruit, something that has been in short supply on Guam since the West Coast shipping lockout. Apparently a ship arrived, because the vegetables were fully stocked. I went crazy, lettuce, peppers, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, garlic, squash, spinach, apples, grapefruit, grapes, fresh cheese and a bottle of wine. About time. I was getting tired of pasta and frozen entree's. I can hardly wait to make a salad tonight. And maybe some roasted chicken on a bed of orzo. Yeah, that sounds good to me.

       On my drive into I pass through the construction zone on Route 4. One day of work, and the contractor has already busted open a water line. It was a veritable geyser of water, shooting four feet into the air while two engineers puzzled over how this could have happened. Lovely.

       Obviously, the typhoon was bad. Very bad. I am leaving Guam for the mainland on Sunday, I will update more once I reach civilization. Suffice to say that power, water, phone, and gasoline are all non-existant at this point. The storm left Guam a disaster area. I've never seen it this bad in 10 years on the island.  Till next week, adios...

       Amazing. The power is still on at 10:15 a.m. Winds are expected to hit 70-90 mph by noon and intensify until the eye hits around 5:00 p.m. That means the bad weather will continue for most of the night. Lovely. Nothing sucks more than a typhoon at night. Winds are sustained 125 mph right now with gusts to 160 mph. This is a bad typhoon - it's just like Paka all over again.

        urlLink The television  is only showing taped programs. That means they brought down the earth station and stowed the dish. The same thing just happened on  urlLink KPRG , and they went off the air for a few minutes as the tape ran out and the guys were outside bringing down the dish. This is going to be a BIG TYPHOON.

       The weather has shifted today. Yesterday's bright and sunny afternoon is gone. Dawn brought leaden skies and winds. The wind has shifted direction too, coming at me from the the north/northwest instead of east/northeast. The first indicator or cyclonic activity. Current forecasts predict  urlLink Typhoon Pongsana  will skirt us to the east on its northward track.  urlLink Unfortunately Saipan  is athwart the storm track now. I hope it misses them too. They need a typhoon like a hole in the head.  In a flurry of activity I broke out the generator and tested it out, then oiled and loosened the  urlLink typhoon shutters . I expect to put up the other shutters later this evening, but I will hold off on that. I keep hoping the storm will spare us. I don't want another  urlLink Paka .

       I've been focusing lately on the government corruption and underhanded dealings here on Guam.

Oh, I got an email this morning telling me that  urlLink CD Now  has merged with  urlLink Amazon . An internet juggernaut picks up steam. I lost my CD Now Wish List in this merger though.

       This morning's prediction for  urlLink Pongsana  indicates that it will pass east/northeast of Guam and Saipan. It's a part of life here, everybody keeps and eye on the storm and makes their own judgement when to hunker down and batten the hatches. I am hopeful this cyclone will pass harmlessly, but I still got gas in the jeep, extra gas for the generator, made sure the typhoon shutters are loose and smooth running, took an inventory of the contents in my freezer, made sure the generator fired up, and picked up loose crap from around the house. Since I spent a couple days last weekend clearing brush and trimming trees, the foliage should present no problems. I need to pull the yard furniture inside the house, but I'll wait for that. Hopefully the typhoon won't hit and I can relax this weekend. It's been a tough week at work and I could use the rest.

       Time for another edition of what's new on Guam, courtesy of the  urlLink Pacific Daily News  and  urlLink KUAM :    urlLink More Shenanigans at the Airport  - Seems the airport recently allowed a number of employees to resign, cash out their accumulated leave, then rehired the employees at the same pay grade. The positions were never announced, no other applications were taken and the employees faced no other applicants for the job. Airport Executive Manager Gerry Yingling defended this policy by saying that everybody else was doing it, so the airport did it too. Of course this is the guy that last week was defending his government credit card expenses at strip clubs as culturally acceptable here on Guam. This comes just days after the  urlLink revelation  that the airport is paying the salaries of 70 employees that should have lost their jobs a year ago when their agency was disbanded.   urlLink Fraud and Payroll Abuse at the Prison  - With what's turning out to be a regular occurrence, the  urlLink public auditor  released  urlLink another audit  damning another GovGuam agency. This time the  urlLink Department of Corrections  was cited for repeated abuse of overtime and hazardous pay for corrections officers, at times tripling the base salary of prison guards. Most troubling is the lack of corroborating documentation that all these extra hours were actually worked. The warden at the prison violently  urlLink defended his honor  on KUAM News Monday night, pulling out a shiv and making  urlLink predictions of violence  if his staff did not continue to get this extra pay.   urlLink GovGuam to Reduce Holidays  - In a stunning display of intelligence, the Guam Legislature yesterday voted to reduce the number of  urlLink GovGuam Holidays from 16 to 10 . It's about time. GovGuam workers receive an inordinate number of holidays. Perhaps this was acceptable at one time, but it just promotes waste and abuse now. November sported four holidays for GovGuam this year, All Soul's Day, Election Day, Veteran's Day, and Thanksgiving. I work in the private sector and I only get 9 holidays. From New Year's to Memorial I get none at all, during that same 5 month stretch GovGuam has 5 holidays.   urlLink Low Water Pressure Continues  - Guam Waterworks just can't seem to keep the water flowing. This has been a problem for years; it reached critical meltdown shortly after Typhoon Chata'an in July. Some villages are without water for  urlLink months now . Asan is particularly hard hit. School has been cancelled at  urlLink Southern High School  time and again due to no water. Waterworks lacks the money to do anything permanent about these outages, and no planning at all is done for future demand. This will reach crisis proportions  urlLink before long . I caught a report on KUAM a couple weeks ago that showed how water from Asan Springs is going to waste, running down to the sea through storm sewers because Waterworks has stopped treating the water from this spring. And the very village this spring is located within has no water pressure. It's a disgrace.   urlLink Convicted Felon Still in Office  - Jonathan Toves still sits on the school board, and no action is underway to remove this guy from office. In order to oust him a recall election needs to be held and two thirds of those that voted for him must choose to get rid of him. Looks like apathy wins this time as nobody has the time or energy to mount a petition drive to hold the special election. Score one for the felon.   urlLink Feds Seize Department of Education Documents  - a story broke a couple months ago about how the Department of Education had dozens of brand new air conditioners sitting in storage while students sweltered in classrooms. Now it looks like the Feds are interested in how all those air conditioners were procured. I suspect another scandal brewing over this one.   urlLink More Dirt on Department of Education  - Another DOE story that's hit the headlines concerns several promotions given to DOE employees that were close relatives of DOE's director and chief superintendent. These promotions were all approved last month on Election Day ( a holiday - see above ), and they came after DOE informed teacher's that there was no money to pay for merit increases owed to the teacher's.   urlLink Terra Cotta Soldiers to Highlight Exhibit  - Finally some good news. An exhibit opens December 15 th  at the DFS Galleria featuring the renowned terra cotta soldiers of ancient China. Cool. That's on my must-see list.   urlLink Batten Down the Hatches  - Looks like a tropical storm or typhoon will head towards Guam by this weekend. Great, more lousy weather. Hope it doesn't turn into a typhoon. That would be a repeat of Typhoon Paka in 1997. That storm ruined Christmas for a great many people.  Well that's it. I am trying to reference stories beyond the PDN, specifically on  urlLink KUAM  and  urlLink Marianas Variety , but both sites present difficulties. KUAM has a nice  urlLink Google Search capability , but they only keep archivesof the television broadcasts. I'd prefer the text, not the streaming video. And Marianas Variety doesn't seem to have anything beyond the current stories on the front page. Until that happens I am loathe to post any links to Marianas Variety. That sucks, since Marianas Variety has a number of quality editorials and regional coverage that I'd love to link.

       Before the holidays are over I'd like a couple goodies for my computer:    urlLink Scanner  - I own a scanner, but it's junked. Don't work no more. Makes it hard to scan photos - actually impossible.   urlLink USB Card  - Seems like all the scanners I look at are USB based, so I need to stick one of these cards in my G3.   urlLink Digital Camera  - Been wanting one of these for a long time, and since I'm already getting a USB card for the G3...  This isn't an actual wish list. I'm going to buy these goodies myself and use my company allowed Personal Choices Computer Benefit to get reimbursed. That's a handy little benefit the company provides. I'm looking at using  urlLink Cyberian Outpost  for the first time in three years to make the purchase. Since they don't ship free to Guam anymore, I'll just send it to St. Louis and my parent's house, then forward the package via US Mail to Guam.  Speaking of computer benefits, last night David was saying he wants a new laptop before he leaves for New Zealand, and that he really likes the  urlLink Dell  laptops. Dude, looks like I can help him with that purchase via our company's computer purchase program. I won't charge him anything extra for it, but I can put it on my credit card and earn some miles easily.

        Video  I watched this film by  urlLink Richard Linklater  last night called  urlLink Waking Life . I rented this movie over a month ago and never watched it, so when I hit Blockbuster last week I decided to rent it again. The movie is entirely animated, though it is  urlLink rotoscope   urlLink animation ; live action footage digitally traced over to create the animation. The movie pulses and throbs constantly but the animation is only a minor aspect of the film, used to accentuate the dream state. The focal point of the film is a series of conversations, diatribes, soliloquies and rants on the nature of life, freedom, death, literature, film making, vengeance and death. The first hour of the film blew me away, animated people just sitting around talking, that's all this movie is about. As the thin possibility of a plot slowly resolved, I started to lose interest. I could see where the film was heading when the conversations started to focus on a particular idea.  I need to watch the movie again this evening, possibly with a little herbal enhancement. It stirred my mind with ideas and possibilities, something that doesn't happen too often with Hollywood films.   Audio  I inherited a  urlLink MiniDisc  Walkman last night from my friend David. He just gave it to me saying it's been gathering dust in his closet. If he ever needs it again, I agreed to gladly return it. He kept all his MiniDisc's, but he passed along the microphone audio jack along with the Walkman. This is cool little gadget for recording conversations and interviews, though I need to pick up some blank MiniDiscs first. I know David used it effectively during his field work in Palau several years ago, hopefully it will incite me to record some conversations with family and friends. A little voice archive for the ages. A quick perusal of the internet has shown a number of MiniDisc  urlLink oriented   urlLink sites . I hope I can find what I want online, music, blank discs, accessories, and information on how to use this new toy.

       Spent about two hours last night at one of Guam's best kept secrets:  urlLink The Marianas Trench . No, this Trench is not the  urlLink actual   urlLink deep water abyss , it is an excellent little Thai restaurant and bar. I recently started hanging out there for happy hour. It offers a number of attractions for me; it's just across the street from my office, the jukebox is free, the pool table is large and only a buck, and the food is incredible. Really. It's one of the best Thai places on Guam. I left there with my mouth on fire, contentedly smacking my lips. I'll be going back for more.

        Movies  - I watched a couple movies over the last few days; some surprisingly good, other disappointingly bad. First the good:  urlLink  Y tu mam� tambi�n   was good, certainly nothing wrong lots of hot sex, though the plot was a tad predictable. Hell really predictable. But I enjoyed it at the time.  urlLink  The Time Machine   was a special effects laden bit of fluff, but then that was exactly what I expected it to be. It was loosely based on H.G. Wells seminal work, though it owed a great deal more to  urlLink the 1960 version  directed by George Pal. It passed a couple hours in an agreeable manner, and  urlLink the heroine  was certainly easy on the eyes.  On the disappointing side I received  urlLink  Angels & Insects   on Friday from  urlLink Netflix . I was expecting more. God, it was difficult to watch the movie. It obviously was made with a great deal of artifice, but the metaphors are blunt and wear thin quickly. Yes, yes, yes, I understand. The civilized world is more savage than the Amazon. La dee dah. Yawn. It's going back tomorrow. A waste of my time. And it got such good reviews. I guess there's no telling for taste.   Magazines  - My first  urlLink Utne Reader  finally arrived in the mail on Friday. About time. I subscribed back in late September. This is a common problem with magazines here on Guam. In fact Friday's mail also include my new Rolling Stone, from September 5 th . So I have a pile of magazines to read;  urlLink Utne ,  urlLink Outside, ,  urlLink National Geographic ,  urlLink Rolling Stone ,  urlLink Macworld , and  urlLink Archaeology . I find that my magazine reading has slackened as I become more addicted to blogs and the daily ruminations of a dozen or so web logs I follow. Or maybe I am just getting bored with my magazines and need to find a new collection to interest me.   Books  - Still reading Hardy's  Return of the Native , though I expect to finish that either today or tomorrow. Then it's on to  Les Miserables  and  Gravity's Rainbow . Some dense reading to finish up the year.

       No, not  urlLink Sirius  - comet  urlLink Kudo-Fujikawa  is hurtling  urlLink past the sun  and back out into the solar system. The newly discovered satellite reached perihelion, it's closest approach to the sun, on January 29. It came within 28 million miles of the sun, twice as close as Mercury. This spectacular passage is too close to the sun for us to observe it directly, the comet is swallowed up in the sun's glare. However,  urlLink NASA's   urlLink SOHO observatory  is uniquely positioned to  urlLink observe  the close encounter. Check out the  urlLink LASCO C2  and  urlLink LASCO C3  images to follow the comet's path.  This comet should be visible in the Southern Hemisphere in the coming days. I'll be looking for it.

       I noticed a great billowing cloud of smoke rising from the airport this evening. Hmm. Not exactly good. Turns out the brand new Tiyan Waste Transfer station  urlLink caught fire this afternoon.  I hate it when that happens. Of course it seems like this happens after every typhoon. Huge piles of rotting vegetation, scrap lumber, tires and plastic. A volatile combination. After Paka the Malojloj transfer station caught on fire and burned for several weeks. After Chata'an the Dededo transfer station caught on fire and burned for a couple days. Not exactly a stellar track record for waste management on Guam. I guess this is why people don't want an incinerator; they'd rather watch these fires burn all over the island.

       Tuesday's PDN featured an excellent page two  urlLink article  on recent research on the cause of lytico-bodig. Lytico-bodig is a neurological disorder peculiar to Guam.  Lytico   is the local name for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig�s Disease). "Lytico usually involves a loss of muscle in the hands and legs with weakness, difficulty speaking, swallowing and breathing."  Bodig  is a form of Parkinsonism dementia complex and symptoms "include stiffness and slowness of movement, tremor or shaking in hands, and difficulty in walking and remembering things." Lytico-bodig occurs only in adults, with onset usually occurring in their 40's. The cause of lytico-bodig is unknown, but a number of theories have been advanced over the years. One of the most popular theories is that the use of  fadang,  a flour made from the seeds of cycads palms, during the Second World War and the lean years after the war was a factor in the onset of the disease. The seeds of cycadia palms are poisonous, but repeated soaking, washing and rinsing can leech the poisons out of the seeds prior to grinding. Since the incidence of the disease is highly centralized in the southern villages of Umatac, Merizo and Inarajan, local or family variations in the preparation of fadang were suspect. This is one of the the theories advanced in Oliver Sacks' book   The Island of the Colorblind.   Sacks, a noted neurologist, visited Guam in the company of Dr. John Steele, a neurologist that has spent decades studying lytico-bodig on Guam. Dr. Steele is a leading proponent of the fadang hypothesis, though many other theories abound; magnesium in the papayas, aluminum cooking implements, genetic predilection, or various viral or bacteriological agents.  Now a new theory has arisen. A  urlLink USGS study  proposes that untreated water used in the river towns of Umatac, Merizo and Inarajan exposed people to toxins released by algae and bacteria at certain times of the year. One of the compelling reasons against the fadang hypothesis is the occurrence of conditions similar to lytico-bodig in both Japan and New Guinea, where there are no cycadia for human consumption. However, the locations in Japan and New Guinea are also centralized on small river villages, leading the researchers to suggest that long term exposure to untreated freshwater toxins can induce lytico-bodig.  It is highly possibly that a cause for lytico-bodig will never be found. While records of people suffering from lytico-bodig stretch back nearly 200 years, not a single person born after 1952 has shown any indication of the onset of lytico-bodig, leading many researchers to suspect an environmental cause that is no longer present in the population. This could be the decline of fadang as a food staple in the Chamorro diet, or the introduction of a modern water treatment system following World War Two.  Some links to lytico-bodig:    urlLink Google results for lytico-bodig    urlLink New Zealand article on Oliver Sacks'  Island of the Colorblind     urlLink Another article about lytico-bodig and Oliver Sacks    urlLink University of Pennsylvania article on neurological disorders    urlLink Page 3 of this newsletter focuses on lytico-bodig and NIH funding    urlLink The US Geological Survey study that prompted my post   While this disease may forever remain a mystery, other health problems on the island are well known and treatable. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer are widespread on Guam, and directly attributable to smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise. This deadly trifecta affects far more people than lytico-bodig and they are eminently preventable  and  treatable.

       A quick rundown of things happening on Guam:    urlLink  Southern High School still closed.   Mold is growing unabated at the troubled Southern High School. This benighted school has been plagued with problems since it's inception. Budget over-runs, delays in construction, shoddy construction, unfinished construction, allegations of graft and corruption, violence among the students, faulty air conditioners, water problems, and now a mold infestation.   urlLink  Utility Restoration Continues.   An announcement is expected this week, lifting Guam's nearly two-month boil water notice. Power is restored to 87% of the island. GTA crews continue to repair some of the 11,000 lines still damaged and inoperable throughout the island.   urlLink  Endangered Species Released.   Biologists release 50 Guam rails,  ko'ko  in Chamoru, into a specially protected habitat on  urlLink Andersen Air Force Base  today. This refuge has been cleared of brown tree snakes and will be patrolled by U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents to keep the area clear. This is an important second step in securing a future for these flightless birds. A stable colony of rails exists 40 miles to the north in Rota, the result of ten year's work by biologists and conservationists. Perhaps one day the bird will thrive again on Guam, but not until the snake population is under control.   urlLink  Ocean Adventurers Due to Arrive.   A man and his nephew sailing a raft across the Pacific were due to arrive on island yesterday. They left California in mid-September and will terminate their adventure on Guam. They wanted to continue on to Japan, but lack the funds to continue the journey.   urlLink  GovGuam Budgets in Disarray.   GovGuam is out of money. They need to lose people or cut pay, both political suicide. The current option being discussed is another "early out" like they did in 1999. That program worked like a charm: All the qualified people left GovGuam and only the morons that couldn't get another job stayed. This looks like a repeat.

       Last night I watched the rush hour showing of  urlLink  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind   at the  urlLink Guam Megaplex . It was pretty good, plenty odd and damn funny in spots, but it  is not  a kid's movie. Once again I was flabbergasted by some people. This couple sat down for the movie and brought along a small child about 5 years old. I don't mind kids in movies, but I am worried about the effect watching a movie filled with murder, sex and drug use has on small impressionable minds. I know I wouldn't let a little kid go to such a movie. When I was a little squirt of ten or eleven back in the mid 70's, it took an act of God for my parents to take me too a PG movie. I can remember bothering my mother for weeks before she agreed to let me see that shockingly lurid film,  urlLink  Star Wars  . Never mind  urlLink  Jaws,   it was totally verboten and so were all the   urlLink Pink   urlLink Panther   movies. No point in even asking to see those movies, she'd never allow it. That seems so long ago now.  A few years ago I went to see  urlLink Something about Mary   and ran into a friend and his nephew, a boy of about 8 or 9 at the time. I've known this kid since he was 4 and I felt pretty uncomfortable when he leaned over and asked me what Ben Stiller was doing before his big date with Cameron Diaz, "Uncle Tom, what's he doing? Is he masturbating?" Uhh, I can positively say that word did not exist in my vocabulary when I was eight. Now this is a great kid and I don't think he was permanently warped by this movie, but I find this disturbing. Pundits and social commentators would probably mark this as just another example of our crumbling value system. Perhaps they're right.

       Ate lunch at  urlLink Thai Kitchen  today, one of the few Thai restaurants left standing after Typhoon Pongsana. It's funny. Thai Kitchen is located on the bottom floor of my office building, yet I rarely ate there. The food is good, but they never make it hot enough. And I know the owner, Toy, pretty well. I used to have a crush on her daughter Angie when she worked at  urlLink Marty's . Hell I had the hots for most of the girls that worked at Marty's back then. Angie now covers the evening shift at Thai Kitchen and I enjoy chatting with her occasionally.  urlLink Ban Thai  and  urlLink Marianas Trench  figured so large on the horizon I never really bothered with Thai Kitchen. With their destruction in the typhoon I'll be spending a lot more time at Thai Kitchen.  The food was excellent. Fried lumpia to start, then an order of chicken pad Thai and an order of penang chicken. God I love penang. I love to just eat rice with the penang curry sauce drizzled over it. Damn, it's making my mouth water right now just thinking about it. Anyway lunch was good.  Ran into Lori Mendiola at Thai Kitchen too. It always strikes me as funny, Guam is a tiny island with a pretty small social scene. Yet I haven't seen Lori in probably a year, and I know that woman goes out all the damn time. Now this is the second time in a week that I've run into her. These things always work in cycles.

       Did you watch the Superbowl?  I did. I went with a friend to  urlLink Guam's Planet Hollywood  for a $40 fund-raiser party for Guam Youth Football League. While this was the most expensive option for watching the big game, it was an all you can eat or drink affair with pizzas and hamburgers on a special menu. Pretty tasty stuff. And the corporate sponsor,  urlLink Northwest Airlines , offered up a couple trips to Honolulu plus tickets to the  urlLink Pro Bowl  next week. Unfortunately I did not win one of these grand prizes. Hell, I didn't even win a t-shirt or inflatable lounge chair. But it was a good place to watch the game, eat some food, drink some beer and support GYFL and Pop Warner football on Guam.  The game itself was okay, at least during the first half. I could tell by halftime that Tampa Bay had the game in the bag. Oakland was just overpowered by Tampa's defense. The second half was a waste of my time. About the only fun thing to watch was Rich Gannon throwing interception after interception. His receiving corps really showed their age; it looked like they were standing still most of the game. I was ready to go back to work, but those plane tickets kept me glued to my seat to the very end.  One bad thing about watching the game on Guam is the lack of commercials. The local affiliate feels free to preempt almost all the highly anticipated, expensive and over-hyped commercials that typically run during the Superbowl with cheap local substitutes. And there is a paucity in any local commercials. Often the same commercial will run twice or three times in a single commercial break. And the same ads run every commercial break. These crummy ads just grate on my sensibilities. If anything, the constant barrage of crappy commercials inspires me to avoid those advertisers entirely.

       I got this huge pile of dirty laundry packed and ready to go. I figure I will pull out of her in about an hour, after I eat some lunch. I don't expect to be back anytime soon. Probably not until this evening.  Kirino came by last night and again this morning. He wanted me to help him write a letter to his boss at work. I agreed, but I was dismayed to find that my  urlLink G3  cannot see the  urlLink LaserWriter  for some reason. I suspect a fault in the  urlLink Farallon EtherMac iPrint LT . I'll be damned if I can troubleshoot it though. That's frustrating. And poor Kirino had to transcribe his letter back online a yellow legal pad.

       Walked outside around 3:30 this afternoon to take a break. Lo and behold a face from my past was walking across the parking lot.  urlLink Doctor Snell Fontus , a surgeon employed by our clinic several years ago, visited the clinic this afternoon to say hello and share some memories. I used to hang with this guy in 1994 and 1995. He was a real player around here. Now he lives and practices in Eugene (check out that snazzy web site). Another reason to move to Oregon.

       Now that things are pretty much back to normal in my life, I need to accomplish a number of chores this weekend.     Laundry  - I have about a ton of unwashed clothes in my house right now. Last time I washed a load was November. It's pretty ugly. I think I need to go ahead and just spend a few hours at a laundromat tomorrow instead of using Dianne's washer and taking two or three days to finish everything.   Groceries  - My refrigerator is barren. Just a couple bottles of water in there. I need produce and staples like chicken, beef, rice, flour, beans, etc. I'm going to  urlLink the warehouse retailer  tonight after work for bulk products. Sunday I'll spend at  urlLink the local oligarchy's grocery chain  picking up a few high-priced produce and specialty items.   More Cleaning  - The house is still a cluttered mess and needs desperate attention. I'm turning on the air conditioner tonight in a bid to pull some moisture out of everything in the house. Leave the air on for a few days and things should dry out nicely.   Volunteer  - I volunteered for a roadside cleanup tomorrow morning so I'll be up early picking up trash in Tamuning.   Auto  - Time to change the oil in my truck. I might just default to a local mechanic and have him do it for $20. Spare me the hassle of dealing with it and disposing of the waste oil.   Backup  - Time to backup the myriad computers I possess. Backup the Dell at work tonight, then the computers at home on Saturday and Sunday. Not really hard, but it does consume vast amounts of time using CD-R's.   Electronics  - I need a new battery for my cordless phone and my Mac's motherboard. Radio Shack's shelves are barren. What to do? Sunny Electronics I guess.  I'd like to squeeze in a couple movies on DVD too. It's will be a busy weekend. Maybe I should call in sick Monday and just watch the  urlLink SuperBowl .

       There was a luncheon today at work for a couple departing employees. Leilannie took a job with another division of our company and I wish her luck. Arlyn is just leaving Guam and heading for greener pastures in New York. I feel bad because I completely spaced on their farewell party and went somewhere else for lunch. I doubt I'll ever see Arlyn again since last Friday was her last day. I am going to make an effort to say goodbye to Leilannie before Friday.  Another departure is coming up fast. My good friend David is leaving for New Zealand in less than two weeks. It is certainly time, he's been talking about leaving for at least three years. I am surprised the  urlLink University of Auckland  held his position and grant money for that long. Hanging with David has been one of the basics tenets of my life on Guam, along with my job, football and paddling. It's hard to imagine Guam with David. It will certainly involve less partying.  Seems like all the people worth something are leaving Guam. I had lunch with David and Von and a general course in our conversation was about how Guam is going down and all the rats are jumping ship. I guess that means I'm a suicidal rat or something.

       Is there anything worse than a Wednesday morning hangover? And my plan was to visit  urlLink Radio Shack  last night. Instead I ended up at my local watering hole, drinking beer, listening to the jukebox and playing pool. In retrospect it was certainly more enjoyable than shopping for batteries at Radio Shack.  I'm not really sure if the headache was caused by the beer or this morning's frigid temperatures. It was 22� Celsius this morning, about as cold as it ever gets on Guam. I was freezing when I woke up today. I do love this time of year though. The weather is the best Guam gets; cool, sunny, and breezy all day long. I don't need to run the air conditioner at all.

       I spent an hour today undergoing torture, I mean physical therapy. Since September my elbow has been a source of constant pain. Turns out I have tennis elbow and it hasn't gotten any better in four months. Since the big, horse-pill ibuprofens weren't even dulling the pain anymore, I broke down last week and got a referral to my friendly physical therapist, Julienne.  I've known Julienne for 10 years, but I've never been her patient before. I now realize she is an evil, evil, sadistic woman. After a couple minutes chatting she started jamming her thumb right into the tender locus of pain in my elbow and I was seeing stars. Whoa. Sweet Mother of Pearl. Thank God that didn't last more than ten minutes. And while I enjoyed the ultrasound and ice packs, those stretches she made me do were also pretty painful. But I want to get better, not just mask the pain with steroids and painkillers. So I am willing to endure the pain, both in my elbow and my pocketbook ($25/visit, at least 5 visits).

       Last night I finally saw  urlLink  The Two Towers   at  urlLink my local theater . I expected great things from this film, and I wasn't disappointed. Peter Jackson has created an incredible saga of films with the Lord of the Rings. I stared at the screen, slackjawed, for three hours last night. The realization of Gollum is a tour de force, and Gollum comes across as the tortured soul of the film. The other characters are good, but the animated Gollum practically jumps off the screen.  I was awestruck by the locations. New Zealand  is  Middle Earth. The sweeping panoramas took my breath away. Jackson knows how fantastic his country's wildnerness is, and he uses it every chance he gets. They must have spent a fortune on helicopters in this movie.  Overall the special effects were good, but I was disappointed by the Ents. I guess it is hard to properly visualize a sentient tree-being, but these ents just looked ridiculous. Jackson's results seemed geared for comedy, all bulbous noses and funny expressions. I just imagined ents as more  fearsome  - ancient, sorrowful, powerful and pissed off trees hell bent on vengeance. That was my only major complaint though.  The Two Towers left me wanting more. It is a difficult story, since it is the middle segment of a great tale. It has no real conclusion, leaving several story lines unresolved. I want more, I want more now.

       Spent most of this weekend watching movies. Thank God the DVD and TV work just fine on the generator.  Started off the weekend with a showing of  urlLink  The Ring   at the Hafa Adai theaters on Friday night. I can't really complain - it's about what I expected, and for a buck fifty I got two hours in air conditioned comfort.  Yesterday was a marathon of DVD's, starting with  urlLink  The Princess Bride  , then  urlLink  Magnolia  . A quick bite to eat a  urlLink Jeff's Pirate's Cove  and it was back to the DVD's, watching Milla Jovovich in  urlLink  Resident Evil   and then Jennifer Aniston in  urlLink  The Good Girl   before lights out at 10:00 p.m.

Nobody said it was easy, It's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy, No one ever said it would be this hard, Oh take me back to the start.  I was just guessing at numbers and figures, Pulling your puzzles apart. Questions of science, science and progress, Do not speak as loud as my heart.  And tell me you love me, come back and haunt me, Oh and I rush to the start. Running in circles, chasing tails, And coming back as we are.  Nobody said it was easy, Oh it's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy, No one ever said it would be so hard.  I'm going back to the start.

       My street got power last night. Unfortunately my house is still dark. We lack a meter on our weatherhead, which was destroyed in the storm. GPA still has to come out and install one. Any guesses on how long that will take?  Actually I am not too upset by this continued blackout. After all there is a storm  urlLink coming directly for us . Power, water, phone, I am certain all these utilities will be knocked back into the stone age by Sunday afternoon.  I need to start hoarding water again. Fill up the trash cans, coolers and bath tub with water.  Get gas. Already the lines have reappeared. Every filling station last night had 40 to 50 cars waiting for gas. People are hoarding fuel while they still can.  It looks like this will only be a  urlLink tropical storm  though -  urlLink winds  of  urlLink 35 to 60 knots . I can handle that. I am worried about all the debris that is still lying about though. That stuff is going to fly...

        Catch Me If You Can - Oops You Already Did  Jonathan Toves, Guam's convicted felon serving on the school board, is  urlLink back in jail . Seems he was busy violating the terms of his pre-trial release by selling sushi on school grounds for the last few years. Seems he agreed to stay away from school property while awaiting trial on his criminal sexual misconduct with a minor charge. I bet that sucker wishes he never ran for school board.  Somebody asked me if I wanted to watch the new Steven Spielberg movie a couple weeks ago. I told them no need, I already knew about a thief writing bad checks all over creation and scamming people with a series of impersonations.   The Chips Begin To Fall  Late last week federal investigators announced a couple high profile convictions of senior Gutierrez administration officials.  urlLink Therese Hart and Dr. Davina Lujan,  both were high level administrators at GMH under the Gutierrez administration and both plead guilty on separate charges. Hart plead guilty to money laundering in a $150,000 wrongful death settlement to her father. Lujan was convicted of conspiracy to distribute narcotics. The two plead guilty several months ago, but the cases were sealed until last Friday. Both Hart and Lujan were cooperating fully with federal investigators in ongoing investigations.   Ongoing investigations?  Could there be more Gutierrez administration officials heading for jail? Chances seem likely at this point. U.S. Attorney Fred Black was quoted as saying that his office's number one priority was government corruption. About time too.

       I left Guam on December 21. I arrived in St. Louis on December 21, after 24 hours of travel. Go figure.  Spent four days at  urlLink Cape Albeon , the  senior living community  that my parents moved into during 2001. Yeah, I was hanging at the old folks home for a week. Hell, played lots of cards, had internet access, digital cable, housekeeping service, indoor pool and jacuzzi, exercise room, and two meals a day in the main dining room. My parents love it there, and I can see why. It's like a luxury college dorm, just full of old people.  It snowed on Christmas Eve. Over seven inches. My first White Christmas in ten years or more.  My niece Kristine was married on December 27 th . This joyous event brought the entire family together for the first time in five years. Of course I was the missing link in all previous family get togethers. The family celebrated a raucous Christmas the next day at my brother Jim's.  Spent the following week in Chicago with my sister  urlLink Nancy . Movies, music, museums, mass transit. Ah, big city living for a week! New Year's was fun, lots of champagne (let's hear it for  urlLink Veuve Clicquot Brut !! Yah!)  urlLink The Field  was a little disappointing but the  urlLink Art Institute  had a couple great exhibits. And the  urlLink Lincoln Park Zoo  was a fun afternoon.  I got marooned in Houston for a couple days on my return. Thanks Continental. Luckily my good friend Craig was there to put me up for a couple nights. He's a hell of a guy. I got a chance to enjoy his great homebrewed beer and hit some pretty cool bars in his neighborhood. And I wasn't in any hurry to get back to Guam anyhow.  Brought back a bunch of  urlLink books  to Guam. I was disappointed to find my power was still out, over a month since the typhoon and lines are still littering the street. What's up with that??

       I am back on Guam and settling back into the normal routine. I start back to work on Monday. I enjoyed my three weeks back in the States, visiting family, playing cards, playing the tourist and generally enjoying being away from Guam. But before I bore anyone with the particulars of my trip, let me talk about the typhoon and the devastation it wrought on the island.  The storm was the worst to hit Guam since 1976. Supertyphoon Pongsana struck Guam with sustained winds in excess of 160 mph, with gusts to 185 mph. The real problem was the length of time this storm stayed over the island. All the meteorologists predicted the storm would turn to the north. It did, but only once it struck Guam. The storm paused over the island, then headed north towards Rota and the open sea. All told, the island was battered by immense, damaging winds for almost 12 hours.  Simply put, Guam was caught with her pants down. The meteorologists kept saying the storm wasn't going to hit Guam, right up to Sunday morning. People didn't prepare, a foolish oversight on their part, but then the best minds said this was nothing to worry about.  Recovery efforts were stymied by a disaster that happened at the height of the storm. A fire started at the Mobil fuel tank farm, probably sparked by lightning. The entire tank farm ignited, one after another. The fire burned for six days because of no water pressure in the pipes. Since many people didn't bother to fuel up before the storm, vehicles were soon stranded on the sides of the road. Long lines appeared at the few gas stations that survived the typhoon, and riots reportedly broke out among the anxious people in line. By Wednesday after the typhoon all gasoline sales were halted, and only emergency vehicles were allowed to refuel. It was an amazing sight to see the highways and intersections deserted and empty. The fire was finally extinguished on the following Sunday, and gas stations tentatively started sales again. Only $10 of gas at a time though.  This gas shortage stymied all relief efforts. The wells could not pump water, the telephone exchanges went down, and of course the damage to the power grid was massive. No power, no water, no phone service, no gasoline. A 21 st  century community, hurled back to the 19 th  in the space of a few days.  Damage at my office was extensive. The windows blew in and flooded the server room, bringing down our main server. To make matters worse, GTA fried up their routers with an poorly installed generator and left us with no connection to our corporate offices. The air conditioning units were destroyed and the carpet was soaked. Mold started growing fast, so we tore out all the carpeting and lived with the funky aroma.  All in all, life was reduced to the bare essentials; finding water, food, gas, and long hours at work. Seems like I was working like a fool before my departure date.  I flew off the island on December 21, and arrived back in St. Louis later that same day. It was a good two week vacation with my family, in both St. Louis and Chicago. I got a white Christmas, I think for the first time in two decades, and it was great visiting with my family and friends again. When I returned to Guam, the water was back and the phones were working again. But the power is still out in my neighborhood. 61% of the island has power restored, but my neighborhood looks like it did the day after the storm. Lines are still down across the street and power poles are still at awkward angles. Scuttlebutt says at least three more weeks before they get to our area. Great. I might have power by February. Great.  I return to work tomorrow. A return to the normal routine. I guess I will start posting my normal reports again tomorrow or when time (and generator) allow.

       I read through the appendices for  urlLink The Lord of the Rings  tonight, something I have never fully accomplished. In particular, the section concerning languages caught my eye. I skimmed the parts pertaining to the Elvish languages, but what really caught my eye was when Tolkien started talking about how the story was 'translated' from the common speech into Modern English, and that since the Riders of Rohan spoke a more archaic form of common speech, their dialogue was liberally spiced with Old English words and syntax. The Hobbits also spoke a variation on this archaic tongue, and most of the names Tolkien supplies for his characters are in fact translations. Interesting idea, probably something a linguist would think up. But then he starts producing examples of this common speech, and the corresponding translations. That's when the depths of Tolkien's language fixation struck me. Not only did this guy whip up several languages like Elvish and Dwarven, provide detailed etymologies and orthographies; he concocted an entire language which is never mentioned in the trilogy, and then translated names and locations into the appropriate English and Old English words. That's just twisted.

       A couple weeks ago  urlLink I mentioned  some ways that GovGuam could cut costs. I suggested trimming non-essential agencies like CAHA and the library. Seems somebody was listening - here's a quote pulled from the  urlLink front page  of today's PDN:  "Our concerns are going to deaf ears. What is the government's priority? I cannot see the existence of Mass Transit, CAHA, Parks and Rec over DOE... The Legislature and administration have to look at the resources of this island. This department is dying."  - Jose Nededog, Education Policy Board Member  Nededog's comments concerned the Department of Education, which is in dire straits and cannot meet its payroll tomorrow. DOE owes millions to vendors and utilities, and more millions to the Department of Revenue and Taxation. The entire educational system is teetering and ready to collapse.

       I finished reading  urlLink  The Lord of the Rings   last night. It left me a little cold. I expected to experience the story differently; after all two decades passed between my readings. Middle Earth is still an intricate and finely wrought world, but the actual story telling by Tolkien is a little bland. I find it amazing that he could flesh out languages, histories, geographies, different races and a panolply of ancient and puissant artifacts, but still fabricate such one dimensional characters. The stark light of Middle Earth's  urlLink manicheistic  struggle between the forces of good and darkness drains the characters of depth and motivation. But Tolkien's primary mode of storytelling is legends and histories, and the trilogy fits squarely into this style. At any rate, the storytelling in  The Lord of the Rings  is positively verbose compared to  urlLink  The Silmarillion.    The Silmarillion  is a dense compendium of edited histories and myth, with very little dialogue or character development.

       I just popped in the newsfeed from  urlLink KUAM  that I mentioned last week. It looks pretty good - I am pleased with myself. Now if only the  urlLink PDN  would provide a feed I would be totally happy.  In other news, the  urlLink USS Carl Vinson , a Nimitz-class nuclear aircraft carrier, is  urlLink on Guam for a couple days . I think I will run down to the port and take some pictures of her today or tomorrow. These aircraft carriers are the largest warships in the world, and I'd like to take a gander at this gigantic projection of US military force. Apparently the Carl Vinson is headed to Okinawa, replacing the  urlLink USS Kitty Hawk  (a frequent visitor to Guam) while it is deployed to the Persian Gulf for young Mr. Bush's glorious little war. Make no mistake, the Carl Vinson is a newer, bigger, more capable ship than the Kitty Hawk - could Dubya be sending a message to North Korea?

       The past weekend offered me a chance to spend time in Tumon with my guest and absorb some culture. David's visit gave me the opportunity to finally view the terra cotta warriors from the  urlLink Q'in dynasty on display  at the  urlLink DFS Galleria.  I only regret not alloting more time for the exhibit - security guards ushered us out before I viewed everything. I guess I need to return again in a few days and absorb the entire show, maybe pick up a catalogue. The exhibit is a quality production, with incredible artifacts on display, plenty of informative displays, and excellent additional materials available in the gift shop.  Saturday night was also a great chance to catch some excellent jazz at the Fishbowl, an upscale little nightspot in Tumon. Larry Franquez, Carlos Laguana and  urlLink Patrick Palomo  performed a couple sets to an appreciative crowd. Franquez punctuated the music with inspired drum solos that set the audience clapping. Franquez and Laguana are  urlLink Berklee  alumni, and all three are consumate musicians. Both sets were excellent, I just wish we sat a little closer.  I frequently complain about a lack of interesting things to do on Guam. I guess this last weekend proved me wrong.

       It turned out to be a pretty good weekend with Dave. He left this afternoon, back to the cold hand of winter in Tokyo. Hopefully he left with some good memories and a full belly! Sheesh - for a skinny guy I don't think I've ever seen anybody pack away the food like he does. I was truly in the presence of a master. He truly humbled me at the Outrigger's buffet Saturday night. And he must have consumed a pound of bacon at breakfast. Cripes.  We caught some good jazz at the Fishbowl, checked out the terra cotta warriors from the Q'in dynasty, and did a lot of sightseeing. He was blown away by the beauty of Guam, something that's become dulled in my daily life. I hope he returns - I actually enjoyed playing island host for a change.

       Did I mention that the problems at the Guam Memorial Hospital, and how it is overstaffed? Well here's a good example: an administrative assistant at the hospital (who just so happened to be assigned to former hospital administrator and Dr. Davina Lujan) is out on emergency sick leave,  for  two years .  KUAM News ran  urlLink the story  last night, detailing how the new administration was scrutinizing the length of the leave, from September 2, 2002 to August 30, 2004.   Acting Administrator Bill McMillan, said, �We have decided to do an independent review of this sick leave request in light of the unusual length of sick leave.�    Seems the employee had ten months of sick leave donated by a physician at the hospital, under GovGuam's leave-sharing program. The donating physician was the husband of this employee's personal doctor.  I hate to pillory this woman, but it points out another example of government waste on this island. Leave and holiday requests are loosely regulated, and rarely enforced. A very good friend of mine worked for GovGuam for five years yet she never took a day of vacation. During those five years, she went on well over a dozen trips throughout Asia and the Pacific. Personal trips, holidays, vacations, but not business trips. Her boss, a  judge  for Christ's sake, simply took all her leave requests and tore them up. He never submitted them, saying she would need them someday. Sure enough, when she quit her job she got a pile of cash for all that accumulated leave. I just know I would never be allowed such leniency in my private sector job. This woman at GMH may very well be sick or unable to go to work for a long time, but using sick leave instead of going on disability is doing only one thing -  juicin' the system for all it's worth.

       Looks like I got another house guest this coming weekend. I just got David out of the house, and now my high school buddy  urlLink Dave  is coming down for a visit from Japan. Last time I saw Dave was 8 years ago. God - that makes me feel bad since he's just a 3� hour flight away and I've never visited him. So despite the fact that I was looking forward to a quiet weekend at home, I will put on my entertainer fa�ade and take Dave around the island. Maybe a hike, some time at the beach, a couple bars, a couple restaurants. All the good stuff that makes Guam a 'pleasure island.'

       I'm working late tonight, probably for another hour or two. It sucks, but it's the best time to pull data from the servers in Laguna. Fewer people processing claims means more bandwidth for me. As it is, pulling this data takes ten to twenty minutes per query. I shudder to think what it would be like tomorrow morning when I need to hand in this report.  Since I'm getting tired, I think I will actually prepare the data tomorrow morning. I'm basically just sitting here, making sure the process doesn't hang. Which means time to surf the web and goof off a little.

       Add to the litany of Guam's crumbling social services:  urlLink Guam Memorial Hospital Authority  (GMHA), Guam's only civilian hospital, is running $1 million into debt every month. The new director at the hospital is  urlLink spouting dire warnings  about 'complete financial collapse' and massive staff cutbacks at the facility.  It's no secret that the hospital is a mess. Locals say that GMH stands for "Get Me to Hawaii," a reflection on the number of people that go off island for medical care. Hell, our current Lt. Governor  urlLink left Guam for medical care  earlier this month. The hospital lost its accreditation ages ago, so long ago I can only vaguely remember discussing this as an age-old fact ten years ago. The new administrator, Bill McMillan, says GMHA needs to trim 300 people from it's payroll. Again, this is no secret. Everyone knows the hospital is overstaffed and provides pitiful healthcare. The hospital is run by GovGuam, and GovGuam is interested in one thing,  providing jobs.   Perhaps I am being cynical, but I expect Bill McMillan to join the rest of broken and discarded hospital administrators. Most seem to last about six months to a year before they resign in frustration. The bureaucracy at GMHA thwarts all attempts at change. After all, they make enough money to go off-island for their healthcare and avoid GMH entirely.

       The  urlLink Pacific Daily News  ran a  urlLink story today  about a near disaster involving a  urlLink Philippine Airlines  flight in December. Seems a flight from Manila came within 35 feet of the ground over Nimitz Hill during it's approach to the  urlLink A.B. Won Pat International Airport . The plane snapped several power lines before the flight crew rapidly pulled up and averted a CFIT (controlled-flight-into-terrain). The Airbus A330 contained 115 passengers and crew. This is harrowingly similar to the  urlLink 1997 Korean Airlines Flight 801 crash  of a Boeing 747 into the same hill, which resulted in 228 people dying.  The NTSB informed the Philippine Air Transport Office with their  urlLink preliminary report  and disciplinary action was taken against the flight crew. They apparently mentioned their error to no one and simply flew back to Manila. It was only after ground crews at the  urlLink Ninoy Aquino International Airport  noticed damage to the fuselage that an investigation was initiated.

       I went to my last physical therapy session today. Six weeks with Julienne and S.O.A.R. and my elbow is no longer a problem. I will continue with my exercises and stretching, but I don't need the ultrasound or electrical stimulation anymore. Hat's off to Julienne and Ed for a job well done.  She did say one thing that irked me though. As she was giving me a deep tissue massage (aka digging her thumb into the sore point on my elbow continuously for half an hour) she said if I tweaked my elbow again I should forego additional p.t. and simply get an injection of cortisone. I said I didn't want to mask the pain, but actually heal the injury, but she insisted that an injection would heal the damage, make me feel better, and cost a lot less to boot. If that's the case, why did I just spend six weeks going to S.O.A.R. and getting tortured for $25 a pop? And why did she insist back in January, when she called me and initiated this episode, that physical therapy was the way to go? I felt a little put upon by this revelation.  Ah well, my tendonitis is going away thanks to Julienne, so I won't make too big a deal about it. In the future however, I might take more stock in my doctor's suggestion and take the shot.

       I heard a couple tidbit this weekend about a couple things.    Seems  urlLink Pyra Labs , the company that runs  urlLink Blogger ,  urlLink has been purchased  by  urlLink Google . It will be interesting to see how this develops in the next few months. I like Blogger, but I have a few complaints (mostly about  urlLink my archives  - what's up with that? Fix it already guys). Hopefully this new situation will stabilize the development of Blogger and iron out a few of the more irritating bugs. That seems to be a  urlLink common complaint  too.   And the rumors are flying about  urlLink Salon's   urlLink imminent demise . This distresses me, since I have been a regular reader of Salon for a number of years. Lately it's been on of my core sources for world news, commentary and information. It would suck to lose this outlet, because  urlLink My Yahoo  and  urlLink CNN  just blow. I was willing to pony up the cash for a membership at Salon, but apparently they can't muster enough subscribers to make ends meet. The  urlLink discussion of this at MetaFilter  has been very anti-Salon. The great unwashed take Salon and David Talbot to task for his lavish compensation, prime location in downtown San Francisco for the Salon offices and a number of other profligate excesses.    I welcome my new Google overlords, and swear my undying fealty to the Google regime.  Perhaps I may suggest they archive all of Salon's articles while they still have a chance?

David and I shared many good times on this island, and I was happy to help him out during the last couple weeks. I am happy to see him go, he has a good thing lying before him. In many ways I am jealous about his departure. He's off for New Zealand and his Ph.D., I'm just going into work tomorrow to debug some SQL stored procedures. God speed David. We will share a beer and talk story again.

       The new governor, Felix Camacho,  urlLink addressed the island last night.   urlLink To put it bluntly,  the government is deeply in debt and  urlLink cannot make payroll  in the next couple months. His solution? Raise taxes, and  urlLink borrow $120 million,  and maybe he might possibly consider the eventuality of perhaps someday in the indeterminate future address the issue of whether the government could face the reality that at some point he might task his directors with looking at the conditions necessary to conceivably layoff a couple hundred GovGuam employees. Not that his administration would make such a drastic move;  urlLink he would empower the legislature  to make the politically devastating decision to axe the lazy minions that pad GovGuam's payroll.  It's no secret that GovGuam is overloaded with staff. Cushy government jobs are awarded to the political faithful and their relatives, often filling positions with unqualified loafers. And GovGuam benefits are very plush; a fully funded healthcare system, generous leave accrual, a plethora of paid holidays, and a plush retirement pension fund. Too bad they can't pay for this anymore. Hell they could never afford to sustain these programs indefinitely. Seems like the time has come to gut these benefits. But the politicians are caught in this cycle of catering to the GovGuam voting bloc: Any cut in these benefits, or God forbid - a round of layoffs, and the responsible politicians will be quickly escorted from office. I seriously doubt any Guam politician has what it takes to lay people off.  Instead, our ostensibly Republican governor is going to raise taxes and take out a gigantic loan against our already heavily indebted government infrastructure. Just what our struggling economy needs, higher taxes and an increased debt load.  I can think of a number of things to help GovGuam out of this mess.    Layoff several thousand mopes across the entire GovGuam payroll.  Everybody talks about eliminated the "dead weight" in GovGuam's payroll. It's high time for people to get laid off. I'm not talking ten of fifteen people. Thousands need to lose their jobs. Put the fear of God in the lazy bastards and make them actually work. Maybe that way someboy will finally answer a damn phone in a government office on a payday Friday...   Close non-essential government offices.  The passport office, the medical referral office, SPIMA, CAHA, the Chamorro Land Trust, the Commission on De-Colonization, and consolidate the mayor's offices into a few regional centers. Mothball the Guam Museum and the Guam Library for a year or two, until things pick up again. It pains me to say it, I love to support the arts and literature, but both those institutions are pathetic jokes right now anyway.   Raise user fees and licenses and aggressively pursue collections.  Bump up automobile registration fees, driver's licenses, gun licenses, court and police clearance fees, pavilion rental fees at public parks, and any other possible way to make up a little bit of cash.   Legalize casino gambling.  I can think of nothing greater that would spur tourism and create jobs on this island. I'm not talking about measly riverboat gambling or rinky-dink pachinko parlors; I'm talking Vegas-style resort casinos, with large casinos, quality shows and entertainment, and world-class dining. The Japanese would swarm here if we offered that kind of entertainment. I just don't understand the general fear and scorn the public shows for gambling. Many suggest that it is a "cultural" thing, and that because the Catholic Church opposes casino gambling it must be wrong. Hell, the church is worried about diminishing returns on the bingo game racket they control throughout the island. Others worry about widespread gambling addiction. Uhh, don't we already have a dog track, legalized cockfights (try finding that anywhere back in the States), and sanctioned gambling at village fiestas and the Liberation Day Carnival? Somebody somewhere is pulling a fantastic snow job on the people of Guam and protecting the vested interests in this under the radar gambling that goes on all the time on Guam. Why not bring it above board and tax it properly?   Sell off the public utilities.  Unload GTA, at any price. That should have been done years ago. Same with GWA and PUAG, though I doubt anybody would buy those agencies, they're so fundamentally messed up. GPA seems financially and structurally stable, but that is because they are an autonomous agency. So if was can't sell the other public utilities, do the same to them and pull them off the government's General Fund teat. But unload GTA. The phone system here sucks. Privatization can only improve the situation.   Institute a sales tax.  I was baffled by the fact that Guam has no sales tax. Instead, costs are absorbed by a gross receipts tax on merchants, which seems like a pretty slipshod process. By putting a sales tax in place, we could generate a few million every year. By making this a clear cut tax on sales I am sure the government would eliminate companies under-reporting their profits or just selling stuff under the table.  This was the product of a few minutes brainstorming. I just can't believe that the only idea our politicians came up with was "let's take out another loan, and uh, ask the federal government to give us more money, and increase the property tax on the already struggling real estate market." Different administration, same mopey ideas. Just a different set of talking heads on my TV.

       A gentle rain has been falling all day. I don't mind; it makes for an easy excuse to lie about and read  urlLink Tolkien.  The amount of thought he put into Middle Earth dazzles me sometimes. He created several languages, thousands of years of history, the genealogies of many houses, geographies of myriad lands, and magical beings and artifacts. He crafted the prototype for all fantasy novels that followed.  My brother Jim suggested I check out the  urlLink Encyclopedia of Arda . When I was younger I owned several encyclop�dia of Middle Earth, a detailed atlas, and a sketchbook of various characters. I suspect these tomes are all buried in my brother's basement with the few goods that remain in Missouri, abiding till my return. This online compendium contains all these things and more. Editorials about the nature of  urlLink Tom Bombadil  or the true appearance of  urlLink balrogs  demonstrate a deep mastery of Tolkien's world and his incidental writings. Tolkien's world was a gift to all the geeks of the world, something for them to obsess over endlessly. Middle Earth was first and foremost, before the Simpsons or Star Wars.

       I spent all day sleeping. I am not sick, but I was bone-weary from this week of work and playing host to David. I was going to visit a bar last night after work, but my spirit flagged shortly after 5:00 p.m. I turned for  home and hearth instead. David followed a couple hours later, and I made a tasty curry for dinner. Then it was time for sleep. I popped a couple melatonins and slept deep dreams.   urlLink Those melatonins  really put the mojo on me. I slept soundly until a little before 9:00 a.m. Though I slept late, I was still lethargic and sluggish. David went out a couple times on errands, but I stayed at home all morning and fell asleep by 1:00 this afternoon. And I just awakened ten minutes ago, after sundown. I feel refreshed, but I can certainly go back to sleep in a few hours.  Maybe a little dinner will rouse me from my self-induced torpor.

       I was right. A couple of those Navy vessels stopped in  urlLink Guam yesterday . As I suspected it is a working visit, refueling and repairing a couple troop transports.

       Funny how something I thought finished two months ago has come around to bite me in the ass again. The powers that be were not please with the results and commanded a retuning of the data in the hopes to bring our rates down a little more. This was the collosal project I toiled on for several months. This is round two. Hopefully I can knock this off in a day or two.

       Woke up this morning, went outside to watch the sunrise. The US Navy was several miles offshore. Definitely a battle group, couple destroyers, a cruiser, and what looked like transports. I imagine they are stopping off in Guam to refuel, then heading for the Gulf. No mention in the newspaper of any fleet arrivals though. Maybe they are just passing by.

       Pentagon tells bomber crews to be ready to deploy to Guam. Move is seen as a show of muscle.  By Greg Miller and Paul Richter Times Staff Writers  February 4 2003  WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon has alerted bomber crews that they could be sent to the Pacific &#8212; an apparent message to North Korea that the United States remains prepared for military action in the region even as it focuses on a possible war with Iraq.

       I finished  urlLink  Gravity's Rainbow   last Thursday. Took me about a month, but I managed it. I need to read more  urlLink Pynchon . It was fascinating and hilarious, a romp through the ruins men's souls and the Europe. I recommended it to my friend Von. I hope he can handle it. He usually reads stuff like Steven King, Tom Clancy or that dude who writes all the stories about lawyers - Grissom? No, Grisham. Pynchon is a little more  dense  than those mass market potboilers. But the payoff is so much better.  Picked up  urlLink  Diaspora   by Greg Egan on Friday. Polished it off on Sunday. Tasty science fiction, full of interesting ideas about humanity's future. The idea that our destiny lies within a constructed digital existence as immortal, sentient software. Compelling reasoning.  Started reading  urlLink  The Lord of the Rings   on Sunday evening. Last time I read Tolkien I was 14 or 15. That's twenty years. Time to get reacquainted with Frodo, Gandalf and Company. This is a special volume; all three novels in one book, as it was originally intended. So far it seems much more simplistic than I remember it.

       Ladies and Gentlemen, I am now the proud owner of a  urlLink Sony DSC-P71 digital camera!!  Most excellent. The batteries are doing their initial charge right now, so by tomorrow morning I will have a digital camera to tote around and shoot photos. I am excited. I have a pretty good  urlLink SLR camera from Olympus , but scanning photos is such a hassle. This should eliminate the bulk and hassle of the real camera and let me shoot photos off the cuff. Cool.

        urlLink Willie McCool , pilot of the ill fated Columbia Mission STS-107, spent a number of years on Guam in the 1970's. He attended high school here before entering the Naval Academy. He married a Dededo girl and maintained close contact with Guam and his in-laws. He was bearing the Guam flag with him into orbit on this mission.  His  urlLink obituary and funeral announcement  ran in today's paper.

       What a delight to rediscover a favorite song! I just popped in one of my favorite  urlLink compact disc's , and there it was waiting for me. An old friend ready to say hello, talk story about paddling, old friends, the ocean and canoes. Life in the islands. Been a while  urlLink Kaopuiki Aloha ...  Speaking of old friends, I got a friend crashing at my place for a couple weeks. He was supposed to leave for New Zealand on Sunday, but he got delayed until February 16. He's got no where else to go, so he's set up camp on my couch.  Ylig Bay Bed & Breakfast.  Cook up some food every night, watch a DVD, drink a few beers and talk story. In the morning, I whip up some coffee and off I go to work. And he doesn't even hang around the house during the day, he's got a little sideline job helping install air conditioners. No worries, it's actually kind of fun. This is actually the most I've seen of David in some time, and I am glad to help out. It is understood that at some point he will return the favor in New Zealand. Hopefully sooner than later too.

       Yesterday I took a hike with David down to  urlLink Tarzan   urlLink Falls.  This is one of  urlLink my favorite places  to visit on  urlLink Guam ; rolling hills, a great waterfall, pockets of riverine jungle, and it's a pretty good workout coming back up too. But it's been a while since I last made the trek. At the top of the first hill there was a sizable encampment going on: three Toyota 4-Runners, two big tarps, a couple large tents, a big mess kit, a number of large coolers. At first I thought it might be a Chamorro family setting up house/ranch on public property (it's been done before). But then I noticed the US flag flying and a couple haole guys reading a paper. We passed them by and then it struck me:  urlLink Boy Scouts!   Towards the bottom of the trail, the effects of Typhoon Pongsana became apparent. The entire trail was covered in fallen trees and thick bramble. Hikers had made a detour around most of the fallen debris but the main trail was completely useless from the top of the third hill all the way to the falls. We made it down with no problem and spent about a half hour looking around and relaxing to the sounds of falling water.  The hike up was okay, but made difficult by the fallen trees. A lot of scrambling was involved. When we got up to the top of the first hill, the Boy Scouts were still camped out. Only one guy was there, so I guess the rest of the troop was off somewhere. I struck up a conversation with the guy.  "You guys Boy Scouts?" I asked. "Yep," he replied. "We're out here for the weekend." "You know that trail is pretty messed up down there," I said. "It could use some clearing and trailblazing." "Yeah, we're hoping that GovGuam will send somebody down there to clear it out," was his answer. "It makes it pretty hard for the boys to get to the falls with all those trees down."  I said my goodbyes and moved on. I was a little dumbfounded. My memories of scouting include many an outing spent with saws and hatchets, clearing obstructed trails for other hikers. And I know my experience isn't an anomaly: When I spent a month paddling in Canada in 2000, I encountered Boy Scouts working like beavers at several portages, clearing downed trees off the trail. And these weren't little shrubby trees like the one's on the way to Tarzan Falls, these were large pine trees across trails scores of miles from any civilization. It struck me as odd that this scoutmaster just didn't give a damn and expected GovGuam to get around to it eventually. I don't know what planet he lives on, but I find it highly unlikely that GovGuam has the money to send some dudes down there to open the trail. Or if they do, they'll probably bring a backhoe and dump trucks down there and completely ruin the trail in the process.  I guess I am suggesting that an interest group of private citizens take the initiative and spend a little time clearing the trail for the enjoyment of all. And it would seem like the Boy Scouts are an ideal group to lend a hand in this effort. I'm not exculpable either; I could certainly spend some time pitching in on the weekends to clear trails or pick up trash. Hmm...

       I slept very little during the night. The loss of the space shuttle Columbia and her crew of seven troubled my sleep. I dreamt of spaceflight, weightlessness, the Earth suspended below. They were our emissaries into a hostile and alien universe, scientists and explorers, pushing the edge of what our limited technology can accomplish. They paid the ultimate price for daring, like Icarus, to fly towards the sun. They sacrificed their lives not for war or conquest, but for knowledge and the betterment of mankind. I can only hope that this does not stall our exploration of space. Robot probes and satellites can return vast amounts of data, but the human experience is missing from those missions. That is what makes these expeditions important. We are pushing against the constraints of our species, our biology to explore space. That is what makes it important.  urlLink William Gibson  has a  urlLink poignant comment  on  his blog:  "...nobody ever said it would be risk free. If it were, it wouldn't be glorious. And it�s only with these losses that we best know that it really is.   Ad Astra Per Asperum

       I was just about to head off to bed at 1:00 this morning when I decided to check my games on  urlLink Its Your Turn  and see if I could squeak in a couple moves before I went to sleep. There was the headline on My Yahoo page -  urlLink "NASA loses contact with Space Shuttle."  I clicked off the page before it really registered. My first thought was "solar flare activity or something knocked out the radio." Then it hit me, they were coming back down this morning. God I hope it's not what I think. Back to Yahoo and my worst fears were confirmed: The shuttle  urlLink Columbia  has  urlLink broken up  on approach to a landing in Florida. SpaceflightNow was tracking the  urlLink shuttle mission  in near real time and recorded a successful re-entry over the Pacific and that Columbia was performing the large S curves to bleed off speed before landing at Cape Kennedy. When contact was lost at 9:00 am EST, the shuttle was over 200,000 feet high and travelling 12,500 mph. At that height and speed, there was no possibility of using ejection seats. All seven astronauts are presumed dead.

       I was listening to  urlLink K-57  earlier this week and listened to Jeff Pleadwell talk about how he was tired of Guam.

He must be bloody insane if he thinks he'll get $5 million for that place though.  Guess I better head down there tomorrow and get a  urlLink homemade burger  or some  urlLink fish kelaguen.

       Got a little scare last night when the  urlLink power grid went down  around 7:30. I spent the night in darkness, despairing that Guam's power system will ever become stable. Fortunately it returned a little before 5:00 this morning, rousing me to a cacophony of electrical devices sputtering to life; television, stereo, laser printer, lights, fans, air conditioning and the many other little electrical fairies that surround our modern life. Another dark weekend on Guam.

       How cool is this? A collection of  urlLink meteorites  tumbled to earth in the southern Chicago suburb of Park Forest last week. Nobody was injured, but the light show frightened several people, and chunks of interstellar matter punched holes in windows, walls and automobiles. That's damn cool.  I remember this fellow employee and friend of my dad's who had a place out in Pacific, Missouri. The guy had a meteorite in his front yard, right next to the steps up to his porch. The thing was an oblong chunk of melted iron about two feet across that he saw crash onto his property one night. He dragged it down from the hills and set it in amongst the azaleas. It weighed a ton, I couldn't make the meteorite budge an inch. I guess it was solid iron or something. I was about thirteen when I saw the thing, and I was mighty impressed.

       I just completed something I was working on all week while I was home sick. Yeah, it was a video game. I can honestly say I am not a gamer, I rarely play video games of any type. But I had all this time to kill this week, and I was too sick to do much else around the house. So I popped in  urlLink Grandia II  and played for several hours each day. I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the story, and the gameplay was fun too. It's been a long time since I finished a fantasy role playing game like that, easily twelve or thirteen years. I think that was  urlLink Final Fantasy  on a Nintendo. Things have certainly evolved. The depth of the game was much greater, the graphics were beautiful, the music was good, and the plot seemed more mature.  Still, it wasn't all that different from that game  urlLink Ultima IV  I played when I was in high school. Walk around, talk to everybody, pick up a couple friends for your party, kill everything that looks unfriendly, do a bit of shopping, acquire magic and skills, and oh yeah - save the world. The genre hasn't evolved that much. In fact, just by happenstance I stumbled on a  urlLink parody site  that nails all these problems right on the head. It had me chuckling.  Like I said, I don't really play a lot of video games. I can count on one hand the games I've played in the last 10 years. Maybe Grandia 2 sucks compared to other games. I enjoyed it though, and isn't that what a video game is all about?

       Back amongst the living. Wow. That was one nasty bug I caught. Friday I went into work, and it was misery. The cold morphed into the flu, and I sat there in my office in a flannel shirt shivering with a fever of 101� - not good. I got some prescriptions to combat this virus and took a long nap when I got home that evening.  The fever broke during the night and when I woke on Saturday the worse was over. I felt vastly improved, like a new lease on life. Hell, I felt good enough to go to the movies yesterday for a matinee - though in truth I was forced from the house by a six hour scheduled power outage in my village.  Today I feel even better - the pressure and pain in my sinuses has diminished greatly and my energy levels are getting back to normal. I'll take it easy for the rest of today, and I should be good to go on Monday.

       My brother, a staunch Republican, wrote to me with his misgivings about the war. The gist of his arguments was that the U.S. economy depends heavily on foreign investment to keep afloat, and the rise of the Euro threatens U.S. economic dominance. Hence this war against Iraq, a country that deal almost exclusively with European Union Nations, and trades heavily in the Euro. Interesting viewpoint. He sees a decline in U.S. foreign investment, and a concurrent withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed overseas as the country will no longer be able to afford the costs of projecting force across the planet.  His sentiments were echoed in a  urlLink piece today  from the U.K. newspaper the Guardian Unlimited. Interesting read.

       What with war breaking out in Iraq, and coming down with a nasty head cold, I didn't really pay much attention to local news since last Thursday. However, several things caught my eye, and I thought I should post them.    urlLink Marilyn Manibusan found guilty  - The jury reached a verdict on Friday and found the former senator guilty on 21 of 22 charges. Sentencing will be in July, the prosecutor expects a term of nearly 20 years in prison.   urlLink Details released on James Sablan  -  The day before Manibusan's trial started, former Guam Housing Corporation president James Sablan was dropped from the case, and the records sealed. With the trial over, it was revealed on Friday that Sablan plead guilty to his involvement in the fraud and corruption case. His sentencing is also in July, and he could face upwards of 10 years in prison.   urlLink Attorney General's office exempt from 32 hour work week  - Doug Moylan gets his wish; the governor agreed to not reduce the hours for employees in the AG's office. Guess that threat of a lawsuit worked.   urlLink Governor unveils economic stimulus plan  - Governor Camacho unveiled his long expected economic stimulus plan for Guam just before the bombs started falling. His radical suggestions to get Guam working again? Promote tourism and ask the Federal for more military deployments. Wow - now that's something new. I guess he doesn't have any good ideas either. Well let's hope that  urlLink $1.5 million lobbying effort  pays off, because tourism ain't coming back for a long time  That's about it. All eyes on Guam are focused on Iraq, with occassional nervous glances toward North Korea.

       I went a little crazy this evening. Okay a lot crazy. But I am pleased with myself too.  I stopped off at the  urlLink Micronesia Mall  after work today. I needed specialized batteries, one for my PowerMac G3 and one for my cordless phone, and  urlLink Radio Shack  is a good place to find them on Guam. Unfortunately, Radio Shack has gone out of business and the doors are shuttered. I wandered about aimlessly, looking for some other place that could sell me specialized batteries. My hopes were dim, then I spotted a video game store. I remembered buying some computer equipment in that store a few years ago, I thought they might help me.   urlLink The Game Spot  did not have batteries. They did have a tremendous selection of used video games though, most under $9. And a great many of their used games were for the  urlLink Sega   urlLink DreamCast , which I just so happen to own. And I only have a couple games for the DreamCast. Hmm...  I was in game geek heaven. Dozens, no hundreds of cheap video games, and me with a fresh paycheck in my wallet. Not a good combination.  I walked out of the Game Spot without a single battery, but 16 games for my DreamCast    urlLink Omikron-The Nomad Soul    urlLink Grandia II    urlLink Tomb Raider-Chronicles    urlLink Sega Marine Fishing  -  doesn't load    urlLink Dino Crisis    urlLink P.O.D. Speedzone    urlLink Dragon Riders    urlLink Toy Story 2    urlLink Shadow Man    urlLink Unreal Tournament    urlLink Crazy Taxi    urlLink Industrial Spy: Operation Espionage  - doesn't load    urlLink Tony Hawk's Pro Skater - doesn't load    urlLink Championship Surfer - doesn't load    urlLink Draconus, Cult of the Wyrm - doesn't load    urlLink Starlancer - doesn't load   I was pretty ticked that six of the games won't even load. I am going to try cleaning the discs or some other measures. Odds are though, I will take them back to Game Spot and get a refund or exchange. I've never heard of most of these, but what the hell - if I don't like any of them, I can just sell them back to the store or put them up on eBay. Most of them look pretty lame, but I wanted to try the surfing game and Starlancer. They looked worth a try, but I guess it's not to be.

       I recently uninstalled the  urlLink Google Toolbar  on my browser at work. I have used the toolbar for over a year now, and it was an invaluable aid. I quickly searched through hundreds - no thousands of web sites and I was grateful. At first I used only the basic search functions, but I quickly found myself enabling the advanced features and searching Google's archive of  urlLink UseNet postings . Before I knew it, I checked the  urlLink PageRank  of every site I visited and used their rankings as an assessment of the relative worth of any given page. Funny how quickly I adopted Google's value system. I became a willing slave to the toolbar, it's very usefulness made it indispensable.  So why did I remove it? Last week I noticed that the toolbar was different. A new button had appeared on the toolbar which took me straight to the  urlLink Google News  page. I thought this was pretty cool and started leaving a browser window open on Google News during the day, again a useful tool that was especially pertinent with these troubled times. Another bit of  urlLink mindshare  swinging in Google's favor.  Last Monday I started noticing problems with my browser stalling during page loads, and strange network activity when I wasn't accessing any network shares or email. In fact, this problem had cropped up during the previous week, but it became increasingly annoying as I tried to keep up with the escalation in war rhetoric. What was going on? A little investigation revealed suggested to me that the toolbar was doing something behind the scenes. I guess I should have thought about it before; when advanced features are enabled it cheerfully reports back to Google what I am doing and where I am going. It states it in the privacy policy: "Google may collect information about web pages that you are viewing when the advanced functionality is enabled. However, this advanced functionality is optional, and can be easily disabled and re-enabled at any time (by selecting "Privacy Information..." in the Toolbar's "Google" menu.)" I enabled this functionality ages ago and experienced no problems. But the latest version of the toolbar was making my life difficult.  On further reflection, I started thinking about the unheralded arrival of the "news" button on my toolbar last week and the whole automatic upgrade policy. No notice that an upgrade was available, instead Google just updated my toolbar without asking me. To add insult to injury, Google didn't feel it important to send me an email announcing this upgrade, or any other notification ipso facto. I checked FAQ and privacy policy, and indeed, there it was: "Periodically, the Google Toolbar contacts our servers to see if you are running the most current version. If necessary, we will automatically provide you with the latest update to the Google Toolbar." To be fair, Google probably does this with all good intentions but I was quite happy with the toolbar before this happened. If I had my druthers, I would have kept the old toolbar and continued surfing along happily.  So I uninstalled Google's toolbar and the problem with pages stalling disappeared. That was enough evidence for me. I enjoyed using the toolbar, but I don't need buggy, unrequested 'improvements' to my browser. Maybe I'll try it again in a few months, but I doubt it. I decided to give another search engine a whirl, and I downloaded  urlLink Teoma's   urlLink toolbar . It works well enough, though I do find myself jonesing for that PageRank indicator. But it's probably a good thing to break away from that particular Google Meme and make my own decisions regarding a page's relative worth.    Postscript:  Since doing away with Google's toolbar, I've suddenly become a junky for toolbars. First was Teoma, which works quite nicely for searching. But I remembered  urlLink Yahoo  offering a toolbar ages ago - did that still exist? Yes  urlLink it does . Since I have an account at Yahoo, I decided to install that toolbar as well. I wanted to define a word and went to  urlLink dictionary.com , thinking as I typed the URL that this would be a good function to have on a toolbar - lo and behold, they offer a  urlLink toolbar too ! Hell even  urlLink eBay  has a  urlLink toolbar available , too bad I don't buy enough stuff on eBay to warrant using that particular tool. But the coolest toolbar I've encountered so far is from  urlLink Alexa.com , an  urlLink Amazon  subsidiary. The  urlLink Alexa toolbar  offers a Google powered web search, WHOIS lookup, related links, and a button to the  urlLink Internet Archive WayBack Machine . Very cool!  This whole process has been a useful experience, and I located some additional Internet Explorer toolbars.    urlLink Yahoo's List of Toolbars    urlLink WinGuide's page on toolbars    urlLink ActiveWin's page on toolbars   Lest Mozilla users feel left out, Mozdev offers a number of  urlLink add ons  and sidebar utilities that replicate IE's toolbar functionality.

       Back in my dimly remembered college days, I spent many an hour playing video games. I liked to say I majored in Nintendo, with a minor in Intellivision. But before I those heady days of Super Mario Brothers, I wasted far too much time playing this game called  urlLink M.U.L.E.  The premise of the game is completely unlike modern video games - players develop a planet and trade for goods and resources. I absolutely sucked at M.U.L.E. My ineptitude at trading was exploited by my friend Mark; he would continually corner the market in some resource and starve me into submission. Not surprisingly, Mark is an investment banker these days. He was a pure capitalist in M.U.L.E., controlling the means of production. I don't think I ever beat him.  Imagine my surprise when I stumbled across  urlLink not one , but  urlLink two articles  on the internet this week, both detailing the classic game of M.U.L.E. and offering links to a number of viable alternatives and emulators for playing this long forgotten game. Very cool.  And Mark, I challenge you to a rematch buddy. Let's see if I got any better in the last 16 years.

       So, uh, I was keeping up with the reports. The war was starting! The war was starting! Then came hours and hours and hours of endless discussion - in other words, filler. Nothing was going on.  The news media seemed a bit confused about the lack of explosions, and then peeved that this was just a 'preliminary strike' and not the promised onslaught of 'shock and awe' that was expected.

Atta boy Dougie! Keep up the good work.

       Several Guam Airport Police officers were arrested as part of an  urlLink anti-corruption investigation yesterday . Officers were arrested in connection to the theft of Rolex watches in 2001, mishandling of seized weapons, and the theft of a bomb-sniffing police dog.  Yeah, a police dog.  The dog in question was located at the home of the former chief of airport police, who was one of the officers arrested.  Who steals a police dog? I can understand swiping the watches or the guns, but a dog? Does that constitute assaulting a police officer or something?  Reminds of a story I read in a Philippine newspaper a couple years ago during a trip. It was the trial of a police officer accused of murdering his neighbor. The officer was part of a K-9 unit, and brought his canine partner home in the evenings. One night he smelled barbecue and discovered his neighbor cooking up the police dog.  Now that's just plain mean.  The cop was so enraged he shot his neighbor dead. I recall that the policeman was acquitted.

        urlLink Brian Eno  wrote an article for Time Magazine on Europe's opposition to the impending war in Iraq and European views of America. He made a good case, wondering how the U.S. has sunk into a "us versus them" mentality, so far from the cultural and intellectual summit the US achieved in the 20 th  century, and why America stopped asking the profound questions in favor of simplistic world outlooks.   urlLink Christopher Caldwell  offered a counterpoint essay to Eno's. He threw some softballs, but one point reverberated; that Europeans are able to enjoy all these benefits of a modern democracy because of the U.S. subsidizing their defense. He also makes the point that Americans took on this task after Europe nearly destroyed the world with two horrendous wars in the last century - basically America took over because Europe screwed it up so bad.  Interesting points in both essays, and well worth a read.

Cross examination of the witness by the US attorney was long and intense, with allegations that the witness was bribed by Manibusan to vote for a subdivision development:  Johnson asked McDonald if she ever told the investigator that the reason why she changed her vote was because Manibusan offered to buy her ice cream and give her a ride home. Johnson also asked McDonald if she was mad at the former senator because she did not buy her the ice cream.  Ice cream?  Ice cream?  That's a hell of a bribe. I sure hope it was a double-fudge banana-split sundae and not just a scoop of vanilla.

       The more things change, the more they stay the same:  "Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country."

       Gerry Perez, the former president of DFS Guam before his ouster (excuse me -  retirement ) last year, is now in charge of the Guam Economic Development and Commerce Authority (GEDCA) under Felix Camacho. His mandate? To stimulate the economy of Guam, and encourage investment in the island. His solution? To  urlLink funnel $1.5 million  to a Washington D.C. lobbying firm for a six month contract so they can schmooze the federal government for more aid. Brilliant fucking idea. It's been done before - all that happens is some fuck-nut back in D.C. gets rich off Guam's desperately needed cash, and somebody that approved the contract on Guam suddenly has a lot of extra cash to buy prime beachfront land, build a really swanky house, a nice stable of Lexus and BMW SUV's, or send his kids off to Harvard or Stanford. Can anybody spell k-i-c-k-b-a-c-k? There is Hype.  Of course I should say this is totally unsubstantiated rumor mongering on my part, but Lordy Lordy, I've seen it happen before.

       I've been laying off the news roundup lately, mostly because I stuck that  urlLink KUAM   urlLink newsfeed  over on the left sidebar. But significant events are happening, and I feel I must comment on them.    urlLink GMH begins laying off workers.  I think I mentioned a couple weeks ago that the new hospital administrator was appalled by the staff size at GMH. 932 work at GMH, and Bill McMillan has started passing out pink slips to 100 people this week. The first to go are security guards, housekeeping and cafeteria workers. All these services are being bid out to private contractors, and McMillan expects to trim $700,000 off the monthly payroll by outsourcing. A second round of layoffs next month will trim the staff at GMH down to 700.  [Let's hope McMillan can turn GMH around and finally get that place accredited. He is certainly doing exactly what all the other administrators the hospital had  should have  done: Clean house. The employees up at GMH are deeply entrenched and resist any reform action. The trail of broken and defeated hospital administrator's attests to who really holds power up at GMH. McMillan seems intent on busting up the cabal that exists up there. Let's hope he can actually accomplish his goals.]    urlLink Trial for Marilyn Manibusan continues.  Former senator Marilyn Manibusan's  urlLink trial  for  urlLink corruption and fraud  entered it's second full week with testimony from Korean contractor Il Joong Ju. Manibusan is accused of accepting bribes and extorting money from Korean contractors while she was chairwoman of the Territorial Land Use Commission.  [The  urlLink federal government  is intent on routing out the corruption that exists in GovGuam's highest offices. About time. I expect more indictments will be handed down soon.]    urlLink GovGuam workers now on 32 hour work week.  GovGuam workers at several agencies are now working  urlLink 32 hour work weeks , an effective 20% pay cut for those unlucky souls. The Department of Education is one of the  urlLink hardest hit , and protesting loudly over any planned cuts. DOE is probably the single largest GovGuam agency, so the cuts affect the most people in this department. However, DOE is pushing hard to lift the budget impositions, citing concern for the children's education as the reason.  [DOE is in real danger of completely collapsing under it's own weight. Again, it's the same problem that is rampant in GovGuam: the focus is not on educating kids, the focus is on providing jobs. DOE is stuck between a rock ( urlLink the non-existent budget ) and a hard place (the powerful  urlLink employee base  and  urlLink teacher's union ), and it certainly doesn't seem like anybody is  urlLink teaching the students  these days. If I had kids, I sure wouldn't have them in the public school system here. This year is basically a waste. So many days have been missed by students this year, I doubt the seniors have enough credits to graduate and get into college.]    urlLink GovGuam Increases Taxes.  In a  urlLink reckless bid  to totally  urlLink stifle the private sector economy , the legislature passed a 2003 budget that increase the Gross Receipts Tax by 50%, and institutes 'sin taxes' for alcohol and tobacco purchases. I guess somebody was asleep at the wheel, how else could they be so surprised that  urlLink tax revenues has shrunk  so dramatically (by 24%) the last couple years? Oh yeah, the governor wants to borrow $200 million to government expenditures for this year too.  [Mortgaging the island's future to pay off the present. The private sector already subsidizes substandard service from the government, and now the GovGuam would rather punish private businesses than trim the payroll or cut programs. Profit margins are slim on Guam, primarily because businesses need to replicate services GovGuam cannot reliably provide: backup generators because GPA can't keep the lights on, reservoirs and catchment systems because GWA cannot provide clean, reliable water service, hell Leo Palace even has their own earth station because GTA can't keep the phones working. Shows were the politicians real  urlLink interests   urlLink lie , they'd rather protect GovGuam employees and their own political futures than provide efficient service. These tax increase will cripple Guam's  urlLink fragile economy . Hotels are threatening to  urlLink close their doors , construction projects are being  urlLink put on hold , and property values continue to plummet. The end result will be less income for the government as the  urlLink economy  contracts  urlLink further . Good thinking. And hell, float that  urlLink junk bond for $200 million  - if that will help get my two years of tax refunds paid out, I don't care what the long term consequences are. Nobody else seems to give a damn here. It should be noted that a large portion of the $200 million is to pay off an immediate $50 million loan that the governor wants to secure to meet government operations for the short term. I think that is called "robbing Peter to pay Paul."]    urlLink Dededo Dump Fire Extinguished.  Oh yeah, another dump caught on fire Saturday night. Surprise, surprise. Firefighters extinguished the blaze late Sunday night. The Dededo Transfer Station was accepting typhoon debris, mostly wood and plant material. I guess all the decomposition was the cause of that blaze, though the fire department should release a report today or tomorrow.  [Dry season is beginning, the brushfires will commence soon, only exacerbating the situation. I shudder to think about it. And it is a drought this year too. I expect fires to rival those of 1998, when it seemed like the entire island was ablaze.]    urlLink ...And that was the week that was...

Still, I highly recommend the  urlLink APOD site . It's one of my favorites on the internet.

       Listening to  urlLink NPR  can occasionally turn up some real gems:  urlLink Bonnie Buratti , a planetary researcher at NASA, decided to investigate a  urlLink 50 year old controversy . In November 1953, physician and amateur astronomer Leon Stuart photographed what appeared to be an asteroid striking the moon and producing a brilliant fireball. Astronomers dismissed his claims and said the image was actually a burning meteor superimposed on the background of the moon. Buratti decided to investigate Stuart's claim by poring over detailed photographs of the moon's surface taken by the  urlLink Clementine lunar probe . Clementine took over 2 million high resolution photos of the moon during the mid-1990's, and Buratti looked for  urlLink telltale signs  of recent impacts on the lunar surface.  Buratti and Dr. Lane Johnson located a small, 2 kilometer wide crater, with a bright splash of lunar subsurface soil scattered around the impact site - a sure sign of its  urlLink young age.  The location of the crater matches the general location from Stuart's 1953 photo, and the size of the crater is within the parameters extrapolated from the image of the impact. Buratti says the asteroid was roughly the size of a semi-truck and the energy of the impact was 35 times the strength of the atomic bomb detonated over Hiroshima. If this rock had struck the earth instead, it would have incinerated a small city.

       I'm done. Been sitting at this computer for 8 hours, scanning photos. I got a huge pile of prints that need to be scanned, the photos easily stretch back almost a year. My old scanner went south ages ago, and I finally got a new scanner last month. Nothing fancy, just a cheap Microtek scanner, but it fits what I need a scanner for perfectly.  Still eight hours of scanning gets  tedious,  to say the least. I got some great shots of family from the holidays in December, and a really good roll taken last June at an outrigger paddling race. Ask me kindly, and I might just post some of those shots up here.  Time to veg out and leave the computer alone for the rest of the night.

       Since I posted that placid photo of the Pacific yesterday - all sunlight, blue sky, fluffy clouds and calm seas - I thought I would share a photo I took on December 8, 2002; about 10:00 am, well before the storm got really intense. And that is the exact same location as yesterday's picture.     I could still stand outside at this point, the wind was only about 75 mph. Those waves are about 30 - 40 feet high.

       I started a  urlLink weblog  at  urlLink Salon  last month.  urlLink Salon's weblogs  use  urlLink Radio Userland , from  urlLink Userland Software . I haven't had the time to really take Radio for a test drive, but since I like the software and I want to help support Salon, I went ahead and signed up for a year. So now I have  two  blogs. Jumping Jehosaphat.  Radio is a desktop application, so I installed it on my Dell. This makes it kind of difficult to post anything while I am at work - which is one of the advantages of Blogger. Radio chains me to my computer at home. I suppose if I had a  urlLink laptop  with  urlLink wireless networking  and a digitally enlightened urban area with tons of  urlLink WiFi networks , I'd be just peachy. As it is, living on a small island in the Pacific, my options are a little limited. I am reading through the help system today to get some idea of Radio's capabilities. I am certain it can handle posting via e-mail, I just need to figure that out.  I have this vague idea about posting longer essays and stories on the Salon blog, making it more of a literary journal instead of the running daily journal and commentary on Guam that I seem to be developing here. We'll see what happens.

       Today marks the big move out of our old corporate offices on Guam. Good riddance - the CenTam building ( Cen tral  Tam uning - get it?) degraded into a slum several years ago. The stairways smelled like urine thanks to the second floor karaoke clubs and Phu's Place, the apartment building next door was a den of thieves and drug dealers, a 'massage parlor' opened on the first floor, and the landlord did nothing to address our complaints. Still we stayed on as the building slid into ruin and ill repute.  After Typhoon Chata'an, we abandoned the third floor offices, crammed 60% of the staff into one storefront on the first floor and farmed out the rest of the personnel, including me, to our clinic and warehouse facilities. The search began for a new location, with a tentative date set for mid-November.  Well, it's now mid-March and the first offices are ready for occupation at the Baltej Pavilion, our new administrative offices. Starting today, the customer service and medical management departments are located on the first floor of the Baltej Pavilion, and the claims and membership accounting departments are located on the second floor. More importantly, the server room has been relocated to Baltej with no problems. We are now completely out of the squalid CenTam building and good riddance.  As for the other administrative departments that were scattered to the four winds after Chata'an, we comprise the second wave of the relocation project. Our offices will be on the third floor, but the contractor is still building out the walls and offices up there. Should be another month before I am finally ensconced in my new office overlook Tamuning. Once I get over there I will post photos of the new offices. I am excited. Hell, my office has consisted of a dark, windowless exam room with two folding tables, two folding chairs, cat-5 cable dangling from the ceiling, books and boxes piled in the corners, and several yawning holes in the drywall for the last nine months.

       I came across a story today about a guy that was  urlLink arrested for wearing  a 'give peace a chance' t-shirt in an upstate New York shopping mall. He was asked to leave the premises by security guards and refused, so the police were summoned and duly arrested this unruly upstart. He was 61 years old, and shopping with his 30 year old son. The real irony is that he bought this shirt at that mall. The security guards felt that he was likely to cause a disturbance, so they asked him to leave. He wasn't protesting or demonstrating; he was simply shopping.  What disturbs me is the 'likely to cause a disturbance' excuse given by the mall security. Who determines what qualifies as a  'disturbance?' Wearing a t-shirt is cause to arrest a man? I see t-shirts all the time that I think are highly questionable, but I don't see any of those guys heading off in the paddy wagon. What gives here? What is my country becoming?

I've been to the  urlLink House on the Rock  and  urlLink Rock City  atop Lookout Mountain, and both are excellent roadside attractions. Gaiman weaves an engaging story around the interesting idea that the old gods people came to the New World in the hearts and minds of believers, and this decrepit divinity still persists in America, forgotten in the rush to newer deities like the television, computers, or Wall Street. And what happens when these two pantheons come into opposition? Well, read the book.

       The airport in the southern Philippine city of Davao suffered a  urlLink terrorist bombing  overnight. The bombing actually occurred outside the main terminal, in a small covered area frequented by jeepney and taxi drivers. At least 20 are dead and hundreds are injured.  The attack is just the latest in a surge of terror activity in Mindanao and the southern Philippines. The suspected reason is the Philippine government's renewed campaign against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf. With extensive U.S. aid, Philippine military units seized territory from the MILF last month and stepped up efforts to crush both Islamic insurgency groups. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo is a staunch ally in the U.S. 'War on Terror,' and the presence of U.S. troops in Mindanao is just the latest example of her efforts to quash the Islamic insurgents. While the MILF is accused of the bombings, no one has claimed responsibility for any of these latest bombings.  This bombing in Davao is another one that strikes too close to home. I have been to Davao; I have been through that airport. First Kuta, now Davao; will anyplace be safe in the coming months? Seems like Southeast Asia is becoming highly unstable. Bali was targeted because of the high number of Western Europeans, Americans, and Australians in Kuta, an act of terror designed to frighten Western societies. The work of radical extremists. The violence in Mindanao is more pervasive and of a different nature. U.S. involvement probably escalated the conflict, but the majority of the attacks are against other Filipinos and local infrastructure, airports, gas stations, bus stations, water reservoirs, fuel depots. Sounds like a traditional insurgency campaign against hard targets, designed to impede Arroyo's government and force peace talks.

       Joe Murphy, editor emeritus at the  urlLink Pacific Daily News  and my neighbor, wrote an  urlLink excellent piece  published in yesterday's editorial page. He's right too - GovGuam has habitually fallen prey to shoddy work from contractors. The  urlLink Oracle  system  urlLink boondoggle  is an excellent example - $4.5 million for a software system that never worked. But the most glaring example of the government's ineptitude is the troubled Southern High School in Agat. It was touted for years as a state-of-the-art facility, a shining example of GovGuam's commitment to education. I am amazed that people aren't in jail for the mess that was created down there. It took the contractor years to complete the project, overbudget and late. Despite the extra money and time, the swimming pool doesn't hold water, the athletic fields are unusable, the air conditioners don't work,  urlLink water service  is sporadic, mold fills the building, and several classrooms reek and are abandoned. The place is a mess, and yet nobody is held accountable for that disaster.

       I completed my 2002 tax return last night. According to my calculations, I have a sizable due refund this year - and that depresses me greatly. Odds are good I will never see that money - GovGuam has taken it, and will never give it back.  For the ten years I have lived on Guam, not once have I received a refund check in a timely manner. In fact, in 1994 I was interviewed by Guam Cable News about this very problem. Nothing has changed in ten years; in fact, it has gotten worse. For several years in the late 90's, I received my refund check in late October. And I usually file late February. Sadsacks that waited for April 15 had to wait until January to get their money. Last year I filed on February 12 th . I am still waiting for that refund. Since GovGuam is about to crumble into bankruptcy, I doubt I'll ever see that money. It just boggles my mind that this problem has continued for ten years. For ten years the government has not had enough money to meet its obligations, and nobody has done a damn thing. Shame on all of us.

       I'm taking this weekend easy - no big plans. No going out - and no drinking. Rest, relax, read, watch a couple DVD's, piddle around on the internet. That's my idea of a calm weekend after the last hectic month or two. Next week I'll be back in the saddle again, but today I rest.  I watched  urlLink  Fast Runner   yesterday. It was fascinating to watch this Inuit legend come to life; a story thousands of years old, but completely original to me. The image of Atanarjuat fleeing his killers, naked and barefoot, across the ice was easily the most powerful thing I've seen in a movie in a while. But the conclusion of the film really stuck with me. Atanarjuat returns to confront the evildoers, yet unlike Western heroes, he leaves no trail of corpses and blood in his wake. He returns evil with justice, but also with compassion. Makes me think George W. could learn a lesson or two from this film.

       Sorry for no updates yet today. Been extremely busy at work - it's that time of year.  Today's big story on Guam, brutal murder discovered  urlLink in Maite on Tuesday morning . A workman stumbled on a dead man behind the MTO (Maids to Order) warehouse in Maite on Tuesday morning. The man was bludgeoned to death and his body dumped in the empty lot. Gruesome.  It gets worse. Police nabbed a suspect yesterday and he  urlLink readily confessed to the crime . Norbert Keifer confessed to the crime and provided the details of the murder. Apparently Keifer and the victim were drinking at a nearby saloon, LG's Place, and they ended up arguing. The argument spilled outside, and turned into a fight. Keifer picked up a concrete block and pummeled the victim senseless, dragged his unconscious body into a vacant house next door and proceeded to rob him. Then Keifer thought it would be a good idea to bugger the insensate victim. The unfortunate 47 year old victim awoke while Keifer was orally raping the man, and he bit Keifer's 'genitalia' and fought with his assailant. The enraged Keifer picked up the concrete block and beat the man with it until he was a bloody pulp, then dragged the body behind the nearby MTO warehouse.  This is the first murder of the year, and a gruesome one at that. At least the killer confessed and spared us a long manhunt.

       I don't think I mentioned gasoline prices on Guam, but let me quickly bring readers up to speed. Regular unleaded sells for $2.11 99/100  right now at all the island gas stations. Last month during the height of the War on Iraq gasoline was $2.06 99/100 . Gas prices after Typhoon Pongsana were about $1.94 99/100 , and that was during the fuel shortage and rationing.   urlLink So gasoline prices are going up . Petroleum companies are always quick to justify the increases; Guam is a small market, so smaller tanker ships are used; our fuel comes from Singapore, not mainland U.S. were prices are cheaper; the cost of doing business on Guam is high because of insurance; and the latest - GovGuam's 50% gross receipts tax hike.  Still I find it galling to listen to this litany of excuses in the face of worldwide reports on the dramatically falling price of oil. Gasoline prices Stateside are plummeting, oil production is booming. Why are the costs rising on Guam?  Let me explain. Only three companies peddle gasoline on Guam. They got our nuts in a vice, and they can squeeze as much as they like. There is nothing we can do about this but whine and complain. The market on Guam is too stagnant to lure another oil company on island, so the big three are content to wring blood from a stone and only offer these lame excuses in reply.  I guess it is time for me to start cycling to work again. It takes longer, but the equation of time vs. money is swinging away from the costly convenience of my own automobile. Too bad the mass transit system here sucks and is nigh unto useless. I would happily ride the bus to work everyday, if the bus actually ran a real route to my village. The current system of 'call this number and we'll send a micro-bus your way in a couple hours - maybe' just doesn't work.  Can anybody guess who filled up his tank with overpriced gasoline today?

       Next month brings the biannual examinations for certified public accountants. This event promises to lure several hundred would-be CPA's from Japan, Korea, China and Hong Kong to Guam. The PDN has  urlLink embarked on a crusade  to brand this a public health risk since SARS is so prevalent in Hong Kong and China.  Uh - hello? Every day Guam receives thousands of visitors from Japan, Korea, China and the Philippines. How are 500 wanna-be accountants going to radically alter the chances of Guam gettings a SARS case?

       The father of the relational database  urlLink died last Friday  at his home in Florida. Dr. Edgar Codd was 79.   The former researcher at IBM  urlLink published papers in the early 1970's  outlining a  urlLink database schema  that used the mathematical concepts of relationships to define table structure and query construction. His ideas were initially scorned at IBM, but Larry Ellison read the papers, took Codd's ideas and ran with it - creating Oracle and redefining the way corporations looked at databases.

       The Guam Memorial Hospital board of trustees voted last night to  urlLink suspend privileges for Dr. Vivien Batoyan-Sagisi . Sayonara doctor. Astute readers might remember that she plead guilty to a drug charge earlier this year. It's a step in the right direction. Too bad the board refused to consider similar actions against Dr. Davina Lujan, who also plead guilty earlier this year to drug charges revolving around illicit Percoset prescriptions. The general consensus is that Lujan was played by the powers that be, and that she went along with the deals because she comes from a prominent family. Of course, that might be why she is being spared public vilification that Batoyan-Sagisi has endured in the newspapers and television. But still Batoyan-Sagisi is also the central figure in a series of suspect payments totaling $300,000 by the hospital while it was under the purview of former governor Carl Gutierrez.  While their privileges are in danger at the hospital,  urlLink U.S. attorneys have cautioned the Guam Board of Medical Examiners  from taking legal action against the two doctors. So they can still practice medicine on island. I suspect this is because both doctors are cooperating with federal investigations. To me, the charges against these two were basically a squeeze job by the U.S. attorneys, designed to trap them and turn them against the previous administration. Looks like it has worked. Previous attempts to get former cronies to testify against other administrations have met with little success. Why wouldn't they? Take the fall for a corruption charge, keep your mouth shut, serve a few years in federal prison, your family is taken care of and you have a nice job waiting for you in the  urlLink private sector  upon your release. Maybe the doctors figured they had something more to protect than their higher-ups. I doubt the whole story will ever come to light.  Oh yeah, the public auditor is  urlLink reviewing the suspect  contracts involving a radiology contract at the hospital that was signed while Carl Gutierrez had direct control of the hospital. Something smells fishy about that one too. Always did. Why would a cardiologist get awarded a radiology contract? It will be interesting to see how this one plays out.

       I guess the governor was as appalled with  urlLink yesterday's article  in the PDN as I was. He toured the collections in their Tiyan warehouse yesterday and pledged to support the museum and hire a new curator. He also surveyed the heavily damaged museum at Adelup and promised to locate a new facility to locate the museum. Good luck Governor Camacho, I hope you can actually find the funds to create a world class institution.  Full details in  urlLink an article  in the PDN.

       I was originally enticed to Guam by suggestions that I could work at the  urlLink Guam Museum . I'd worked in several museums during college and graduate school, and my degrees in anthropology, art history and museum studies were enough for a number of small museums in the midwest to offer me a position. Instead I came out to this island, looking for adventure and the possibility I could make a difference where it would really matter.   Once I got here however, I realized how pathetic the situation was. At the time, the museum was under the aegis of the  urlLink public library  and housed in a small, decrepit building at the  urlLink Plaza de Espa�a . The library was pathetically underfunded, and the museum was the red-headed stepchild of the library. The situation at the museum was deplorable. Rainwater leaked through the roof, saturating objects and documents. The staff was non-existent, part of that curious shadow world of GovGuam positions that never report to work yet continue to draw a paycheck.  urlLink The Micronesian Area Research Center  ( urlLink MARC ) at  urlLink UOG  took a number of documents into their storage for protection and the television news would occassionally run brief segments on the detioration of the museum.   My contacts on the island were unable to secure me anything permanent at the museum. I met with the historic preservation people, same thing. I met with Hiro Kurashina, director of MARC only to be told the same things - no positions existed. As things fell apart with the promises I took other work to tide me over until the museum position opened. What happens to a dream deferred? You got to work for an  urlLink HMO  instead...  About a year after my arrival, the museum was  urlLink spun off into it's own agency  and a new director appointed. I wrote her a series of letters and suddenly one day I got a phone call from the director about my ideas for the museum and the collection! We met a couple times and she was enthusiastic about me and my ideas for turning the museum around. She said she was securing funds for a curator position, and she hoped I would apply. Cool. I went back to my day job with a smile on my face and hoped for the best.   A couple months later, I saw a position announcement in the newspaper. The museum was hiring for the curator position. I hurried to submit my resume with an application and fired off another letter to the director, telling her I was interested. Weeks passed. Nothing happened. Then I got a phone call from the director. My application was scored by the civil service and it was too low to qualify me for the curator position. Thanks for applying though. I found out later that she hired a guy with a high school education to be the curator. Fabulous absolutely fabulous. And so ended my attempt at a museum career on Guam. I shifted focus and moved wholeheartedly into the private sector.  I mentioned this because  urlLink today's newspaper has an article  about the deplorable state of the collections the museum is storing. The museum is without a building to display the object, has no curator, and the collections are stored in a crumbling warehouse. Insects, mold, typhoon damage. Over ten years have passed and nothing has changed at the museum. They have a staff now, but no trained curator, registrar or conservator. What is especially galling is the fact that we demanded the Bishop Museum in Hawaii repatriate a collection of bones and other ancient Chamorro remains several years ago. Guam received the remains and the governor promised a new museum and internment for these ancestors.  The bones are sitting in moldy boxes in a warehouse, slowly turning to dust.

       Tonight's feature presentation was  urlLink About A Boy , starring Hugh Grant. I had my misgivings at first, but this turned out to be a really enjoyable movie.  urlLink Hugh Grant  isn't one of my favorite actors, but I must admit he does a bang up job as a callow jackass in this movie. I guess this is billed as a romantic comedy, but the love interest ( urlLink Rachel Weisz  - that chick from the  urlLink Mummy  movies) doesn't show up until well after an hour into the film. Even then she's only in a couple scenes. The real relationship is between Grant and the boy, that was the heart and soul of the film. I do wish the movie had more of Weisz though, she's easy on the eyes and has a great English accent. Rowr.

       Today's PDN runs a couple stories about questionable contracts from the previous administration.    urlLink Guam Memorial Hospital contract raises questions  - Why doesn't this surprise me? The public auditor has unresolved questions about a contract to provide radiology services at GMH for the last three years. KUAM also  urlLink covered the story .    urlLink Attorney General's contract causes stir  - A former attorney general who approved a questionable contract for collecting child support payments is now employed by that company. Yawn... this doesn't even phase me anymore.  That's it. I am sure these stories will garner a couple night's coverage on the news, then conveniently disappear.

       It's been a while since I mentioned the road work in my neighborhood. I guess it's time for an update.  Work commenced in late October 2002, after what seemed like an internminable delay. The contractor,  urlLink International Bridge Corporation , spent the next few months excavating the loss topsoil, filling in the pits with coral gravel and grading the gravel into a suitable roadbed for the highway. They also started construction on several retaining walls, the most dramatic being an 100 foot long, 30 foot high wall near the Ylig River bridge.   urlLink KUAM ran a story  yesterday about the contractor unearthing an archaeological site at the site of this retaining wall. The remains of 20 ancient Chamorros were brought to light and all activity has ceased as archaeologists are examining the site.

         Following the Crouching Tiger obsession I am dealing with this week, I fell into a cycle of listening to the excellent soundtrack by Tan Dun. It features Yo-Yo Ma performing some beautiful interpretations on his cello. Inevitably my gaze has shifted to the  urlLink Silk Road , helped along by the  urlLink Silk Road Project  and Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble. I am thinking of pulling down Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta from the  urlLink Project Gutenberg site , if they are available.  A quick troll through Gutenberg reveals nothing however. Luckily Amazon has a translation of  urlLink Marco Polo's travels . It's now ensconced on my wish list, awaiting purchase.

       After the overdose on  urlLink Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon  this weekend, I got martial arts movies on my brain. I returned Crouching Tiger last night, and rented  urlLink Once Upon A Time in China III . I watched the first two installments in this Jet Li series last year and while the plots were a little incomprehensible to me, the action was first rate. This third movie left me underwhelmed. The plot was still confusing and disjointed, but the fights were just not up to the caliber of the first movie. I can still remember the climatic fight scene from the first  urlLink Once Upon a Time in China  -  urlLink Jet Li  and his nemesis battling in the warehouse, teetering on impossibly high ladders as streams of rice spill down from the ruptured sacks of grain. Very cool. This movie had no signature fights that stuck in my imagination, and the climatic battle scene combined the two themes of the movie effortly:  confused  and  boring .  I put  urlLink Crouching Tiger  onto  urlLink my Amazon Wishlist . It will probably be the first DVD I actually purchase. I wonder if there is a special edition DVD with extra scenes and featurettes?

       So my big excitement for the weekend was a movie rental. I picked up  urlLink Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon  at the corner video store. I saw this movie probably three times at the theater during it's original theatrical run, and I've rented it a number of times since. I am entranced by the movie, it is absolutely incredible. Hell, I watched it three times this weekend, and I think I'll watch it again tonight.  I started prowling around on the internet for more information  urlLink about the movie , and discovered that it is actually the fourth book in a series of five intertwined novels written in the 1940's. That sparked my interest, unfortunately the books have not been translated into English, or at least I couldn't find any mention of a translation. They sound interesting, fleshing out the world of Giang Hu martial arts. The books are pretty popular in China and Taiwan, and considered pulp fiction. After reading  urlLink brief descriptions  of the  urlLink stories and plot outlines  on the 'net, when I watched the film again last night I was able to pick up a number of interesting asides and references to the books that stole their way into the dialogue.  The movie has enchanted me, and the entire cycle of novels fascinates me. I would like to read translations of the novels, hopefully someone is up to the challenge and will publish them in English.

       Been sick the last few days. I guess it is a relapse of the cold I had three weeks ago, but this time it came on real fast, and very hard. I was sneezing on Wednesday at work, and by Thursday I was running a fever of 101� F. I split work at noon, drove home in a daze, and collapsed on my futon for the next two days. Wow. I am feeling okay today, a little worn out and I have a nasty sore throat. I wonder what sparked this onset? Anyway, I am taking it low key today and tomorrow. Finish my book, watch a DVD, take a nap. Mr. Excitement.

       Here's a scary story for you: Sean Penn's  urlLink automobile was stolen  in Berkeley last week, and it contained two loaded guns. I find this story scary, not because Sean Penn owns two guns that he keeps concealed in his car, but the fact that Sean Penn is rolling around in a  urlLink 1987 Buick  just disturbs me. That car just screams  'redneck hick'  if you ask me. I guess the vehicle is a hot commodity among those that like ugly 80's GM automobiles.  Anyway, the car was  urlLink recovered over the weekend , sans firearms. Guess the thief came to his senses and realized he was tooling around in an butt ugly ride. I wonder if it was the  urlLink Great White ,  urlLink Stryper  and  urlLink Ratt  tapes in the stereo that made him abandon his ill-gotten gain? Lord knows I would have lit the abomination on fire and driven it off the Golden Gate Bridge.

       Super Typhoon Kujira is rolling its  urlLink merry old way  towards the northern Philippines and Taiwan. Watch out folks - that storm's going be a killer.  I was surprised at how people responded to the threat of Kujira. I suppose folks were caught off guard by Pongsana, and suffered as a result. Seemed like everybody was out gassing automobiles, stocking up on canned goods and batteries, putting up shutters or plywood, and securing their yards against flying debris over the weekend. And that's a good thing - like the boy scouts say: "Be Prepared."  I've heard a couple people propagating a rumor about another tropical depression forming out over Pohnpei. The is no warning on the  urlLink Joint Typhoon Warning Center site , but the satellite photo does show a conglomeration of cloudy weather south of Pohnpei. Nothing I am worried about at this point though.

         Movies DVD Movies       urlLink The Florentine   - Another quality movie about loser drunks in a run-down bar. Good cast, a little scattershot and unfocused though. I know it's an ensemble picture, but keeping track of 12 to 14 people is too much, especially when most characters have only one or two scenes before the denouement. Perhaps I am just getting burnt out on the 'rummies in a dive' film genre.    urlLink CQ  - If you liked Barbarella, you'll love CQ. The movie produces one long chuckle, interspersed with the occasional poignancy at our protagonist's crumbling relationship while he obsesses about the ridiculous movie within a movie he is editing.    urlLink Far From Heaven  - Spare me. This film did nothing for me. I can appreciate the accurate recreation of the 1950's, the stultifying atmosphere and suburban conformity, but I sure don't like being bludgeoned with it. It's the 1950's - and he's gay!  (gasp)   She loves another man - and he's black!!  (double gasp)  Christ. Enough already.    urlLink Snow Falling On Cedars  - A good film. The book's better. Anyway, seen this one before so it didn't really grip me like the first time.    urlLink Scotland Pa  -  I couldn't finish this one. One moderately funny idea, Macbeth in a fast food restaurant. It doesn't work after the first half hour. I made it to about the one hour mark, then gave up. I got better things to do than waste my time with 'Shakespeare for Dummies.'  Of these four movies, I only finished two,  Florentine  and  Snow Falling On Cedars . The other two were a waste of my time and I spent far too much effort trying to sit through them. I think I will curtail my DVD watching for a while.    Books, Magazines   I just finished  urlLink Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom  and it was not bad. An interesting vision of the near future. His ideas are certainly echo memes about weblogs and reputation as the basis of an economy. The science fiction technology reminded me of Greg Egan's  urlLink Diaspora , though it wasn't as far reaching in scope and certainly not loaded with hard science. Interestingly, I also recently read a couple chapters in another book set in this near future, digital utopia of immortal life and endless material wealth. It was called  urlLink Demiurge , and it's available as an eBook. The author of Demiurge is also a writer for the  urlLink Deus Ex  computer game that I own which is set in the near future. I sense a trend developing here. Perhaps the latest sci-fi trend is for authors to focus on cyberpunk human/computer integration, with an emphasis on networking concepts.  The past couple weeks proved a torrent of magazines. I guess the US Postal Service increased the weekly cargo flights or something, because I am suddenly getting magazines from months ago along with the most recent newsstand copies. Recently arrived: February's  urlLink National Geographic , three  urlLink Outsides , the latest  urlLink Utne Reader  and a couple  urlLink MacWorlds . Plenty of reading material on hand.

       This is great, I don't know how I missed this one before.   In November 2002, Alan Ralsky, a notorious 'spam king' that has jammed email accounts around the world, gave  urlLink an interview  with Detroit Free Press reporter Mike Wendland. In the article Ralsky boasted that about his new $740,000 home in a Detroit suburb. Within days enterprising posters at  urlLink Slashdot  had  urlLink located  his exact address and posted it on the site,  urlLink exhorting  fellow slashdotters to give Ralsky a taste of his own medicine.   Ralsky's home was  urlLink inundated with junk mail,  hundreds of pounds of catalogs, postcards, mailings and brochures -  daily.  The irony of the situation is that Mr. Ralsky was not amused with people using his tactics against him. A quote from Wendland's follow up article:  "They've signed me up for every advertising campaign and mailing list there is," he told me. "These people are out of their minds. They're harassing me."    Sounds like  urlLink Poetic Justice  to me.

       The house is sealed up tight this evening. Shutters are closed and locked, my front door is secured with nails and sandbags ring the floor below the door stop. I think this is the best prepared I've ever been for a storm. Too bad it's passing over a  urlLink hundred miles to the south .  Just because the eye of the storm is well south of Guam, the winds are still picking up. I was outside about a � hour ago and the wind was about 35 - 40 mph. I suspect it will pick up to about 50 mph a little after midnight as the storm makes it's closest approach. I am always amazed by the power of a typhoon. The violent center of this storm is affecting hundreds of square miles of ocean, whipping up the winds, driving rain, tumultuous seas. Too think all this fury is engendered by low pressure over warm water and the rotation of the planet. One of nature's rawest spectacles is glancing towards Guam, and it is harrowing to look into the face of this beast.

       Lately I have developed a burning desire for a telescope. For years I wanted one, but I knew enough to dissuade me from pursuing the matter seriously. I knew those cheap department stores telescopes were next to useless, but the 'astronomical' cost of a quality telescope frightened me. Add to the cost of a scope mandatory extras like a quality mount, motorized slewing, lenses and lord knows what else, and I balked at the idea.  Enter the  urlLink Meade ETX  series of telescopes. These small scopes pack a lot of punch for their size. I am seriously considering dropping the cash on one of these. The price isn't unreasonable, and Meade is currently offering a nice deal by tossing in a tripod and a computerized star finder. I think I'll take a couple more days to think it over and check out comparative offers, then take the plunge.  If anything, this purchase is long overdue. I have a reputation among my friends for my stargazing abilities, and I am frequently addressed at parties as the "star man" because I tend to pick out constellations, planets and other phenomena for other guests. It's happened more than once: I'll be browsing the aisles at Blockbuster, or standing in line to get my mail and somebody will say, "Hey, you're the star guy I met at Erin's party a couple weeks ago..." So yes, I think this will be a worthwhile investment, no matter what type of telescope I end up getting.

       Guam's weather is slowly degrading. This morning dark clouds and intermittant showers kept me on my toes during my commute. The weather is expected to worsen throughout the day at Typhoon Kujira draws closer. At this point meteorologists are forecasting that the storm will pass about 140 miles south of Guam overnight and into Tuesday morning.  I put the shutters up last night on a couple windows, I'll probably leave work a little early today to finish up that job at home. I'm not expecting the worst, but better safe than sorry. And I sure don't want to be putting up shutters in the dead of night. That sucks.

       While trolling about on the internet looking for material for the  Affluenza  post, I came across a  urlLink great article  at  urlLink Utne.  I think everybody saw those photos of Saddam's statue being toppled in Baghdad on Wednesday. Turns out the entire event was staged by the U.S. military, and the comparisons to the collapse of the Berlin Wall are just a  bit  exaggerated. The entire area was cordoned off by Marines and the crowd was never more than 200 people tops - including the swarms of media personnel. The toppling occurred right outside the Palestine Hotel, location of the foreign press corps in Baghdad, so the media could have easy access. Even more appalling is the evidence that the crowd were actually anti-Saddam exiles, flown into Iraq only days before by the military. The entire thing was bogus.  Check out the real story at  urlLink Information Clearinghouse.  I will readily admit that the situation seemed odd to me at the time. Granted I do not have television access, but the photos I saw showed a small crowd, with some troubled looking Iraqis at the periphery. The entire thing troubled me at the time, especially the images of the Marine placing the U.S. flag upon the statue's head. I can only imagine how galling the photo was to Arab nations.

       Several years ago I watched a fascinating program on PBS:  urlLink  Affluenza.   God, did that program hit home. The sickness that comes from having too much stuff. I look around my house and I realize I got too much stuff. Multiple computers, collections of things, sets of books, closets full of crap that I never use, yet I still collect more shit. Trying to fill the void of my life with possessions. There's even a book,  urlLink Affluenza,  detailing the subject in more depth. The author of the book, John de Graaf, is also the producer of the documentary. The program suggests possible cures to this disorder. The message is basically to live a simpler, balanced life. Stop buying stuff. Take the bus. "Pretend the Jones' are the thriftiest, least wasteful people on the block. Then try to keep up with them."  There was an article in  urlLink Utne Reader  several months ago, analyzing this culture of consumption from a Marxist perspective. The  urlLink Hidden Life of Garbage  (sorry - it's not free) documents how the landfill commoditized trash, making the reuse of discarded objects illegal and promoting consumption as a method to sustain the consumer economy. Interesting read. I'd suggest checking the local library for the back issue instead of shelling out a couple bucks to read it online though.  Anywho, I came across  urlLink this editorial  on the NY Times website today also written by John de Graaf. The basic gist of the article is how Americans work more than Western Europeans, and while we value  things , they value  time . Western Europeans take nine weeks of paid vacation a year, while Americans average two weeks. De Graaf finishes the article by announcing October 24 as the first  urlLink  Take Back Your Time Day,   a day to reflect on the overworked and overscheduled lives we lead. October 24 was chosen because it is nine weeks before Christmas, representing the difference in lifestyles between Europe and America.

       Not two minutes after my previous post the power went out at my house -  for the second time today.  Goddamn that is frustrating. I understand they need to work on the cables and installing new power poles in the village, but why do they have to do it on Saturday? Why every fucking Saturday?? Can't this be done during the regular work week, when people are not at home. I suspect the reasoning behind these Saturday work crews upgrading the lines in Yona is overtime/weekend pay for the GPA bucket crews.

       One of my favorite areas at the  urlLink Art Institute of Chicago  is the back corner with all the  urlLink Cornell Boxes . The boxes are funky little conglomerations of found objects, carefully placed in a box with one or more panels cut away to reveal the intricate interiors. They are odd, a little disconcerting, often just plain creepy. They are tucked into a corner of the modern art gallery on the second floor. And I found an  urlLink interesting page devoted to Cornell  at the  urlLink WebMuseum .

       Went out last night. Drank a little too much. Oops.  urlLink Sam Choy's  got a pretty good deal on beers though. Buy one  urlLink Heineken  and the next on is only 1� - that's a deal I can get behind and support. And I did too, for several hours. Well I had to celebrate my domination of the  urlLink NCAA office pool  with some co-workers. That's code for I was buying the drinks.  Oh yeah, tropical storm 02W has been given the name  "Kujira."  Great, just great. I guess that means it's going to be a  'whale'  of a storm.  urlLink Storm track  puts closest approach about 100 miles south of Guam on Tuesday morning. This is subject to change though.  I am heading out today to buy gasoline and other supplies. Last night I noticed lines forming at several gas stations while ambling home.

       My attention span for movies has been dwindling lately. Last week I rented  urlLink Autofocus , but I just couldn't bring myself to watch the entire thing. I got about an hour into the film, then lost interest. I even kept it a couple extra days so I could watch the whole thing, but I couldn't do it. It just didn't interest me.  I'm having the same problem with  urlLink Scotland PA  right now. It was supposed to be back last night, and I am forcing myself to watch it right now. What's the matter with me? I should like these movies. They're offbeat, independent films; a type of movie that I usually enjoy. Yet these two movies leave me cold and bored. I'd rather play around with the news aggregator in  urlLink Radio Userland  or read a magazine. Oh well, I guess my crap-o-meter is getting more sensitive as I age; if I don't like a movie, screw it.

       I think I mentioned the burials unearthed recently at  urlLink Matapang Beach Park in Tumon . The entire park was torn up to install a drainage system for the park and San Vitores Road, and workers excavated several previously unknown burials in the park. Up to 37 people were uncovered, and archaeologists say most of the remains are prehistoric.   urlLink A memorial service  to honor these ancient Chamorros was conducted at the park yesterday. A controversy is brewing over what to do with the remains, and how to respectfully handle them. Former senator Hope Cristobal vehemently opposes any action to remove the bodies from the burial sites, while the Department of Parks and Recreation is insisting they need to be removed so construction can resume. It certainly is a conundrum with no easy answers. Whatever the result of this controversy, I don't think anyone will be pleased with the results.

       Looks like the Guam Visitors Bureau (GVB) can join the airport in shady contracts with foreign consultants.  urlLink Today's PDN reports  that GVB also signed a contract with China Link during the final months of Carl Gutierrez's administration, and paid out $34,000 to the firm before the management turnover in January. Lovely. These independent agencies that don't have to follow the general government procurement regulations are rife with these blatant rewards and kickbacks for allies and associates. They ought to be ashamed, instead these people are laughing all the way to the bank.  At least I can rest assured that these surreptitious dealings are not a thing of the past.  urlLink KUAM ran a story  last night about GEDCA's controversial and expensive contract with a Washington D.C. lobbying group. This lobbying firm was incorporated on Guam the day the contract was signed by GEDCA. Apparently the high powered lobbying firm is actually a local group that will attempt to subcontract the lobbying to various actual lobbying firms in Washington D.C. Basically it does nothing, just collects money and hires out other firms while extracting an exorbitant fee from GovGuam. The story makes it pretty clear that the entire contract is just a form of payback for a political smear campaign against Bob Underwood during the gubernatorial campaign last year. The entire tale is pretty convoluted but it certainly makes a person go "hmmm..." I am sure that given enough time, Governor Camacho will become more adept at rewarding cronies, lackeys and other assorted boot lickers, just like Carl Gutierrez did in his 2 terms.

       Got two phone calls this morning from co-workers wanting  urlLink information on the typhoon . I forwarded them some information off the internet, and listened to their concerns about another storm. It is still too early to tell though, so I am not too concerned.  Besides, if a storm does hit Guam all that rain will douse the  urlLink fire at the landfill . The paper quotes Governor Camacho vowing to close the landfill during his tenure in office. Let's just say I ain't holding my breath on that one.

       I spent an hour down the street with a neighbor, checking out his home brewing equipment. It's a pretty damn impressive setup, a great big rig with propane burners, repurposed kegs to heat water, steep the barley, boil the wort and decant into carboys, then small kegs and a CO 2  tap to pour out two varieties at a time. My only regret - I quit drinking for Lent. 10 more days, and I am heading over to his place to get smashed. Hell, he's got an entire bar room set up, with darts, pool, poker, TV and stereo. It's a little pub, two doors down the street.  Mmm, beer...

       Just heard an ominous discussion on the radio. No, it wasn't about Iraq, SARS, the Ordot Landfill or any of the other things occupying my mind. It was a weather forecast, specifically for Tropical Depression 02W. Something is forming down by Pohnpei.  urlLink A storm is brewing , and I always get nervous when they start tracking cyclones on the radio.

       Yes,  urlLink the dump was still ablaze this morning . The smoke was grayish white, a good indication that massive amounts of water are being poured onto the blaze. Firefighters estimate it will take 5 days to extinguish the fire. The governor declared the dump a disaster area last night and asked for $500,000 to be appropriated to combat the fire.  Astute readers will note that the Ordot Landfill  urlLink caught on fire last October , and that it burned for three weeks at that time. That blaze cost GovGuam $750,000 to put out. Flaming landfills, burning debris sites - Guam is an ecological disaster. Hell, I didn't even bother to post about  urlLink the fire two weeks ago  at a Harmon junkyard. After all, that fire only burned for three days before it was doused. It just didn't rate notice.  I noticed that the landfill fire is quite visible from a number of vantage points on my morning commute. I will try and take some pictures tomorrow if it is still burning.

       I was getting ready to hit the sack, but I thought I would check  urlLink KUAM's website  to see if they have any further news on the fire.    urlLink The article  posted by one of KUAM's news reporters discusses the fire at the  "largest land field on the island."  Huh? I had to read it twice before I realized she meant landfill, and not 'land field,' whatever that is.   Now I realize that KUAM's news staff is generally young and inexperienced, but this is a common occurrence on the stories they submit. Seems like most of the articles posted on KUAM are rife with grammatical errors or malapropisms. I don't think the problem is with the reporters though; if KUAM is going to publish these stories they should hire an editor to proof the reports.  I know, I know.  Let he without sin cast the first stone.  But they are professional journalists, I am a disgruntled misanthrope wasting far too much time on my weblog. I think my expectations are not unreasonable.  Bah, I rant for no particular reason. Good night, sleep tight.

       Found out today that I won the office  urlLink NCAA March Madness pool . Very cool, especially since I made my picks at random and then promptly forgot about the entire thing. I guess picking Kansas to go to the final was pretty lucky on my part. Even though the final championship hasn't been played yet (I don't even know when it's scheduled) I am atop the rankings and no one can touch me. Nice little return on my $10 investment. It salves the ache from loosing last year's  urlLink fantasy football league  in the first round of playoffs after a stellar season. That pot was over $400 though, and this one only $170, so I guess I feel halfway vindicated.  Oh yeah, looks like I'm buying a couple rounds this Friday with my winnings. Time and place to be determined.

       It's Monday here on Guam, and time for another  Super Colossal News Roundup!  I'll have to keep it brief though, got things to do today.    urlLink Local girl does not have SARS  - Naval Hospital physicians determined that a 9 year old brought into the hospital last week is  urlLink not infected with the deadly SARS virus . Test results showed that neither she nor the rest of her family are infected with the disease.  And that is a real relief. Sooner or later though, someone on Guam will fall victim to the disease - it's inevitable.    urlLink Another waste of money by the airport  - The airport's current management revealed yet another dubious expenditure by the previous administration late last week. In September of 2002, the airport inked a contract with a consultant in Manila for $24,000 a month, plus another $16,000 a month to a sub-contractor in Hong Kong. And what was the purpose of this consultant? Nobody knows. No one at the airport knows anything about this consultant or what services they are supposed to provide. Requests to the consultant by the current management, asking them to clarify the contract have gone unanswered. The cost of this little boondoggle? Over $300,000 in just four months.  Another example of the last administration's spendthrift ways. Once is unfortunate, but this is just the latest in a string of high priced debacles. Somebody was seriously lax in judgement up there, perhaps even negligent.    urlLink Questions raised about bus shelter contract  -  The Department of Public Works (DPW) is investigating whether the controversial bus shelter contract awarded to former senator Tommy Tanaka was actually completed. While all 330 shelters were built, DPW could not confirm that all the shelters contained the benches and seating required in the contract.  What a surprise - taking public money and not fulfilling the terms of the contract. Gosh, that's a first on Guam.    urlLink Guam Ko'ko released into the maws of hungry cats  - The good news - none of the 26 flightless ko'ko released at Andersen Air Force Base fell victim to the dreaded brown tree snake. The bad news - 23 of the birds were eaten by feral cats. And the agencies directing this structured release program are at a loss, the cats are too smart to be trapped or captured.  Oops. The best laid plans have a way of falling apart. They took care of the snakes, but forgot there are plenty of other introduced predators on island.

       One of the best things about living on Guam is the ready availability of fish. Tuna, wahoo, mahi mahi, and marlin are all present in the waters surrounding the island, and right now people are pulling in incredible hauls on fishing trips. Excellent prices for fish too - $2.50 a pound for yellowfin tuna. That's an excellent price.  I mention this because I ate dinner tonight with Dianne and some other friends. We started with an appetizer of fresh sashimi. The main course was seared ahi tuna with wasabi aoli, an excellent meal. The vegetable was fresh kang kong, and the salad was a delicious helping of home grown ripe tomatoes from Dave Hendricks, sprinkled with fresh basil. Wow. Dianne also made a loaf of tomato/basil whole wheat bread and she tossed in a tablespoon of finadene dinanche to give it a little kick. Like I said - wow. An amazing meal.  After dinner and dessert, Dave treated us to a couple hours of music with his guitar. It was a good evening and definitely the highlight of my week.

       Well, here's an  urlLink interesting story  that isn't getting any attention in the media.  A Florida court overturned a jury decision against Fox News, a  urlLink suit brought  by journalist Jane Akre. Akre claimed that Fox pressured her to submit a story favorable to Monsanto and Bovine Growth Hormone, when her investigation indicated otherwise. She refused to falsify her report, and Fox fired her.  "The ruling basically declares it is technically not against any law, rule, or regulation to deliberately lie or distort the news on a television broadcast."   I wonder why none of the other media outlets picked up this story. Perhaps because they do it too? Reading  urlLink all  the  urlLink disinformation  about the  urlLink American P.O.W.  rescued this week, it's easy to see why.

       Another one bites the dust.  urlLink Breaking news  yesterday that former senator and gubernatorial candidate Tommy Tanaka  urlLink plead guilty  to entering an illegal contract with GovGuam and conspiring to conceal the fact.  I always thought something was fishy back in '97 & '98 - Tanaka ran against Carl Gutierrez in 1994, but in '97 he came out with a full page ad endorsing Gutierrez, and encouraging his supporters to back Gutierrez in the 1998 elections. Right after that he was awarded a lucrative contract to replace all the concrete school bus stops on the island. It stunk to high heaven, and many people suspected a deal was cut. Turns out we were right. The contract was awarded to him without proper bidding and documents faked to make the process look legal. GovGuam used FEMA money from Typhoon Paka restoration efforts to fund this scam, which caught the eye of the U.S. attorneys.  urlLink Justice will prevail .  Needless to say, this is only the latest in a rash of convictions. Yesterday another high level  urlLink GovGuam employee was indicted  on theft charges. And  urlLink airport officials are talking to U.S. attorneys  about the spendthrift ways of the previous administration. I think everyone on Guam is waiting with bated breath to see how far up the federal government will go. It's no secret they are gunning for Gutierrez, but will they collect evidence enough to make a conviction stick?

       Today the gross receipts tax rose 50% for all businesses on Guam. Gasoline prices  urlLink shot up overnight  to compensate for this new cost, and I expect a great many other things will become more expensive in the next few days. Regular unleaded in now $2.10 a gallon. Guess I better start biking to work. Just for the sake of comparison, regular unleaded was $1.87 a gallon at the beginning of February. War and taxes, a killer combination.  The increase in GRT is part of the government's grand scheme to salvage itself from the brink of oblivion without laying people off. Also introduced were 'sin' taxes on beer and cigarettes, and agressive collection of overdue utility accounts. Of course the worse offenders on the utility hit list is GovGuam, but the power is  urlLink still flowing to government agencies . It's easier to pick on the  urlLink little guy , the private citizen that just suffered a 20% pay cut.  Also just announced was an increase in  urlLink fees at the airport , in a desperate attempt to keep the airport afloat after the previous administration's numerous follies. While the landing fees were ridiculously low, increasing them sixfold is nothing but a slap in the face of the airlines. Now Continental is announcing that they are  urlLink 're-evaluating' routes  and to expect fewer flights in the near future. After all air travel is down because of the war. I am no economist, but it sure doesn't seem like a good time to be raising taxes.  Speaking about the airport, more stories are coming to light about the shenanigans at the airport under the previous administration. Mostly the projects are not exactly illegal, just spectacular wastes of money far in excess of what was originally announced. For example, last year's Birdman Rally in Tumon was sponsored by the airport, which at the time officials said would cost about $100,000. Turns out the figure was  urlLink actually more like $1.3 million . And the exhibit at Duty Free of the Chinese Terra Cotta warriors, originally quoted by the previous administrator at $250,000 is actually going to cost $1.25 million. Never mind the $500,000 in travel expenses in just three months of 2002, that's chump change at this point. Today's latest ridiculously expensive airport project is the $5 million executive lounge at the airport, replete with  urlLink $2.1 million in bronze statues  of Guam's former governors.  The money squandered on frivolous and suspect projects on Guam is immense. This profligacy is just shameful when the schools lack books or supplies, and have to lay off teachers.

        urlLink A good editorial  on the deplorable conditions at the Guam Museum ran last week. I totally forgot to mention it at the time. Instead of the rantings of a disgruntled blogger, the criticism was leveled from a far more credible source: Dr. Gary Heathcote, professor of anthroplogy at UOG. I sincerely hope that the administration responds to his editorial with a renewed vigor in upgrading the museum but frankly I doubt anything will happen. GovGuam is teetering on insolvency and now is not the time to be sinking money into a bottomless pit like the museum.   And so the 'death spiral' continues...

       A new theory on the cause of lytico-bodig is making the rounds:  urlLink Eating the Marianas fruit bat was the cause of lytico-bodig.  Seems some researchers are suggesting that during the post war boom, a surging Chamorro population suddenly increased the amount of fanihi that were eaten. The fanihi ate raw cycad seeds, and the poisonous  urlLink BMAA toxins  urlLink   accumulated in the fat deposits on the bat. Intriguing idea, but so many have been proposed in the past. Cycads have always been a leading suspect though.  urlLink The last one that I heard  about mentioned bacterial blooms in certain rivers, which made a certain amount of sense since the incidence of lytico-bodig clusters in several southern villages and suggests a common local source, like a water supply.

       Northwest is offering a great deal on travel to Hawaii and the mainland.  urlLink Only $199 and 15,000 miles to Honolulu ! Damn. The only problem is you have to overnight in Narita both ways, and Northwest is not offering a hotel room like they do with full paying fares. Maybe I could convince Dave Neale to put me up overnight - no wait, he's planning a wedding right now, best I stay far away from that mess.

        Matrix Reloaded  I went to the theater to watch the new matrix movie last weekend. It was a break from the non-stop work at the office. For that purpose it was excellent. Lots of cool special effects, and some chewy ideas to wrap your noggin' around. Too bad those ideas had to be beaten into your skull with a two by four. "Choice." "Free Will." "Destiny." Yawn - oops something just blew up spectacularly. I guess my biggest complaint centers on Keanu Reeves' Neo. If the dude is so damn powerful, why does he even bother with the kung fu? Why battle 100 hundred clones of Agent Smith for 20 minutes, then fly away? Because the digitally created fight served no other purpose than to look cool. It's a let down from the first film, but I certainly don't think it deserves comparisons with  The Phantom Menace.  It's just an average summer blockbuster now.   Whale Rider  Okay, now that I've seen  urlLink the trailer , I am interested. Very interested. I hope this comes to Guam. However we seem to only get all the crap movies and big summer blockbusters. I am guessing I will have to wait until it comes out on DVD to watch this movie.

        urlLink A traditional sailing canoe  was located by the Coast Guard yesterday, more than two weeks after their scheduled arrival in Yap. The Simion Hokulea left Palau bound for Yap on May 7 th , but light winds becalmed what was supposed to be a two to three day voyage. When the Coast Guard located the canoe it was only 30 miles from its destination in Yap, but the crew was weary and dehydrated.  Master navigator  urlLink Mau Piailug  of Satawal and 12 others were onboard the canoe, recreating the traditional voyages between Yap and Palau. The Coast Guard supplied the crew with water and let them continue on to their destination.

       Bowing to the moronic pressure of the Guam Medical Society, Governor Camacho this week  urlLink instituted a flight ban  on the routes between Guam and Hong Kong and Taiwan. The idea is to keep SARS from infected Guam. Both Continental and China Airlines bowed to government pressure and  urlLink cancelled their routes  to these destinations. Various tourism idiots suggested that this ban would  urlLink actually increase tourism.  Uh-huh.  I think this could be filed under "a day late, and a dollar short." Procedures are now in place in Taiwan and Hong Kong to identify travellers with SARS - hell, they were in place almost two months ago. This measure effectively kills the Chinese tourism market, just when the island needs every tourist it can get. Silly, pointless, and ultimately damaging  to the island's economy. There is an  urlLink excellent opinion  in today's PDN on this chicken little decision.

        urlLink Interesting article  at Salon yesterday on a commencement speech given by New York Times war correspondent Chris Hedges at  urlLink Rockford College , in Rockford Illinois. Hedges speech was sharply critical of Dubya and the war on Iraq, and he was not received warmly. He was heckled and jeered off the stage by the audience.   The fact that Hedges was forced off the stage at a  liberal arts  school that prides itself on a newly opened  urlLink center for civil and social engagement  is just frightening. It speaks volumes for the level of patriotic fervor and conservatism that is washing over the youth of our nation. Of course Rockford-Roscoe-South Beloit area is a pretty conservative place, but this is a stark change from what it was like when I lived up there a decade ago. Like the Dixie Chicks before him, Hedges spoke his mind and paid the price. I am certain he is being vilified on talk radio and on a thousand web logs right now. The audacity of a person to question the impudent, imperialist adventures of a third-rate president that didn't even win the election.   I suppose this conservative backlash was inevitable. Today's young adults were reared by the petulant, spoiled baby boomers. As the boomers rebelled against their parent's staunch conservatism in the 1960's, so today's youth has reacted against their parents. They watched their parents behave like feckless fools: broken marriages, wanton sex, drug use, and a constant infantile search for pleasure and eternal youth. It's not exactly surprising that these children raised so glibly by their errant parents would crave stability and a old time values. Something that George W. Bush and his neo-con pals provide. A simpler worldview with no troubling shades of gray. Rock solid, unwavering determination. It has a certain appeal - just ask the Germans in 1934.

       Found a cool photo today: The Mars Global Surveyor turned its camera away from the surface of the red planet earlier this month and took a picture of earth. The photo captured not only the earth and moon, but also mighty Jupiter and three of the Galilean moons orbiting the massive gas giant. Pretty damn cool photo, even if it has been digitally enhanced to bring out the moon and Jupiter in the image.  The best link seems to be at  urlLink SpaceRef.Com's page  - the  urlLink original source  at  urlLink Malin Space Science Systems  appears to have been  urlLink slashdotted  by all the traffic. Somewhere, a web server is dying a horrendous death.  Amazingly, I came by the page from a completely different source - I was simply surfing around, looking for images of the Anatahan volcanic eruption from space. I found them on a  urlLink SpaceRef page .   urlLink    Notice how the ash plume is drifting to the west last week...   urlLink    And how it is drifting south towards Guam today.

       Couple things bouncing around in my head this morning:    I received a lot of whisky yesterday from a co-worker. She is moving to a new home and decided to clear out the liquor cabinet. I guess I struck here as a particularly besotted individual, because she unloaded six bottles of hooch on me. Most of it is Japanese whisky, from the  urlLink Nikka Whisky Distilling  company. I was a little dubious about its quality, but it seems to receive high marks.  There was a photo in yesterday's PDN, this guy caught a 452 pound Pacific Blue Marlin a couple days ago. In a funny coincidence, those bottles of Japanese whisky are embossed with a marlin and the title  urlLink kujiki  (Japanese for Pacific Blue Marlin). Mmm, I think I need to pick up some fish for dinner tonight.

       Typhoon Chan Hom is currently located at 12.7�N by 151.1�E - about 428 miles from Guam. (And you won't believe how long it took me to calculate that distance. It's been a long time since I used any trigonometry. A very long time.) The storm looks to pass Guam with little affect upon the island.

Yep, it's another week, and another revelation of payroll improprieties at a GovGuam agency.

       Deflation - it's become a buzzword on Guam during the past week. Attorney General Doug Moylan  urlLink flat out stated  he will not sign off on the government's $243 million bond scheme, mainly because the government has not done an actual real property appraisal since 1993. Last Friday Ben Pangelinan was laughed off K-57 talk radio when he began defending the bond plan, using a 2001 property value analysis from the bureau of budget and planning as the basis for Guam's real property value's as the determination on how much the government can finance. Callers swarmed the radio call-in show, ridiculing his na�vete and delivering tale after tale about the declining value of property on the island.   It doesn't take a genius to see that Guam is suffering from severe economic deflation. The Accion Hotel, a $45 million dollar project across Ylig Bay from my house, was sold to the Archdiocese for a paltry $1 million in cash. Joe Murphy wrote an  urlLink excellent editorial  in yesterday's newspaper about this very crisis in Guam's economy, citing the recent sale of beachfront property to local developer Al Ysrael for $7 million. The Japanese developer that unloaded the property paid $43 million for the land a decade ago. Stuff like that screams "STAY AWAY" to any off island investment.   To drive the point home further, today's headline cites  urlLink the surge in foreclosures in just the last quarter . Guam's economy is contracting, painfully for many people. And I don't think tourism is going to boost the island out of this hole. The specter of war, and the  urlLink threat of SARS  cast a pall upon the travel industry that shows no sign of relenting.

       Some shorts stories can really knock it out of the ballpark. Ursula Le Guin's short tale  urlLink  The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas   is a tightly condensed exposition on an idea; the good of an entire civilization is built upon an unpardonable sin visited upon an innocent child. The child must suffer horribly, or all the glory of Omelas will crumble. For many, the wrongs done to this child are outweighed by good achieved by all the other inhabitants of the city.  The hyperlink expresses how the short story echoes themes found in Dostoevsky's  urlLink  The Brothers Karamazov  . How right that is. It's been a long time since I read Dostoevsky's novel and I forgot. It is infinitely rewarding to open an old book again like Le Guin's short story collection  urlLink  The Wind's Twelve Quarters   and discover new relationships.

If I messed up on one, the entire batch would fall on my head and chop me to bits.  I survived though, and it only took two weekends sacrificed along with a week of late nights at the office. I think I am the only guy who's set the alarm for the office for the past three weeks.  Hopefully the crush will let up soon. I am taking off tomorrow to get some fresh air and exercise, and then it's back to the salt mines on Monday.

       Rumors flew around the island yesterday that a woman died from SARS at the Hilton. A couple fellow workers spent Mother's Day weekend at the Hilton, and they were pretty freaked out.  The hospital tried to maintain calm, but reports started flying that doctors, nurses and staff at GMH were wearing masks, gowns and gloves in the ER and scrubbing down the entire ER. And when the fire station that transported the woman put up hazard tape and started decontamination proceedings on the ambulance, things got really out of hand.  At a hastily put together, and very overdue press conference, the medical examiner and hospital administrator announced  urlLink that the woman died from heart failure , not SARS.

       Damn! Maybe this is why the sky was so surreal last night. It seemed unnatural, more than a little eerie. Turns out that was for a good reason.  The volcanic island of  urlLink Anatahan , about 80 miles north of Saipan, erupted in a giant plume of ash on Saturday night. Whoa. That's just 200 miles north of Guam.       urlLink Story  and photo at the  urlLink PDN  website.  It's pretty easy to forget that Guam is part of an  urlLink active volcanic archipelago , but Anatahan is not the only island to erupt since I've lived out here.  urlLink Pagan  erupted for several years in the early 1990's, forcing the few remaining inhabitants off the island and back to Saipan.

        urlLink Today's moral:   If you stand around and watch your children pummel another child to death, you will be prosecuted for their crime.  Yesterday a grand jury handed down indictments against the parents of four boys that beat a 10 year-old girl to death last February. Arrested late last night were  urlLink Melissa Ann Cabrera and Benny Chaco Santos . Regina Guzman was assaulted on February 21 and died on March 19 as a result of internal bleeding and infection sustained during the savage attack by the four boys, aged 6 to 9.  [Attorney General Doug] Moylan adds there isn't any evidence that the parents were involved in the beating, only that Cabrera watched as her children assaulted Regina.  Apparently the mother of the boys watched as her lads went medieval on this little girl. Then she lied to police about the boy's whereabouts and the actual beating. The father then told police he took the boys for an appointment in town that afternoon. Nice, really nice. As appalling as the fact that these boys pummeled a little girl to death is, I am aghast that the mother actually stood by and allowed this beating to take place. I don't know what to think about that one.

       Guam's quest to secure over $200 million in a bond offering hit a major stumbling block yesterday. Standard & Poor's dropped  urlLink Guam's bond rating to "B,"  two grades below junk bond status. S&P cited the stagnant economy, the unfunded liabilities of the GovGuam Retirement Fund, and the susceptibility of an economy based solely on tourism as reasons for dropping the rating even lower.  Suffice to say this will make in near impossible to float the much-hyped bond measure that the Camacho administration is touting as the answer to all of Guam's worries. At the very least, an additional $20 million in premium insurance will have to be taken out against the chance of Guam defaulting on the bonds. Looking at Guam's economy, I'd say chances of not meeting our debts are high.

       I must applaud Doris Brooks and her  urlLink Office of the Public Auditor . She has been tireless in ferreting out corruption and abuse in GovGuam. Her latest tour-de-force is the  urlLink final review and audit  of payroll practices at the Department of Corrections. This story initially broke back in November of 2002, when it was revealed that personnel at the prison were taking home 3 times their base pay in undocumented overtime, hazardous pay, and holiday pay. Now that the audit is complete, she is sticking to her guns, pressing for tighter controls at the prison, and forwarding the audit to the attorney general for possible prosecution.  She found all sorts of chicanery going on at DOC, including exempt supervisory employees collecting overtime.  We also found that the Chief Parole Officer reported a total of 1,055 hours of overtime in FY2001 and a total of 458 hours by the nine months ending June 2002. These constitute overtime costs of $40,654 and $17,649, respectively. The Department of Labor, in its January 2000 audit report, did not specifically address the Chief Parole Officer�s exempt status (see summary in page 8). However, the Chief Parole Officer�s responsibility does not appear to meet the non-exempt criteria stated as he wields supervisory and administrative power over the DOC�s Parole Services Division. Therefore, we concluded that the position of the Chief Parole Officer may not have been duly authorized to incur overtime.  She also detailed the adventures of the facility superintendent, who collected 62 hours of overtime and hazardous duty pay in a three day period that he was transporting a prisoner back to Guam. This story was featured in a media report last November when the superintendent appeared on the evening news defending his overtime as a cost cutting measure. Try and figure that one out.

       Yesterday's big story - former Mass Transit general manager  urlLink Tony Martinez changed his plea  before the Superior Court to guilty.  Astute watchers of the shenanigans on Guam will remember Martinez's case as one of the first examples of government corruption under the Gutierrez administration. Martinez was caught with his hand in the cookie jar in 2001, when allegations came to light about his abuse of the Mass Transit Authority's credit cards to purchase computers, airplane tickets, hotel rooms and other sundry items for his personal use and the benefit of his family. He was indicted in March and originally plead innocent.  Martinez agreed to pay restitution to GovGuam, plus a $7,000 fine and 2,000 hours of community service. At his sentencing in July he can expect to receive some jail time as well.  His cohort in crime at GMTA, Tony Diaz, was also indicted in March. He plead innocent and his trial is scheduled to begin on September 12.

       Last Friday we moved into our new offices. "We" means the IS, Pricing, Sales, Contracting and Human Resources departments. No more temporary quarters, no more folding tables, no more dangling cables, no more exposed wiring. We are in our new location now, the 3rd floor of the  urlLink Baltej Pavilion , and it is nice. Much better than the disaster quarters that housed us for the last 10 months, and even nicer than the old offices in the CenTam building.  Our move was Phase Two of the Baltej relocation. The first phase occupied offices on the first and second floors for Customer Service and Claims respectively. In a few weeks the final phase will happen, when the Finance, Marketing, Legal, and the executive officers move in. Til then we are the only occupants up here.  The move went off without a hitch and I've spent the last couple days situating my cubicle to my taste. I don't really care about the furniture, but I now have three PC's instead of one. My old Dell P3 and two new IBM P4's - one 1.8 gHz and one 2.4 gHz machine - each with a boatload of RAM and huge 100 gigabyte hard drives. Ooooo...

       The Dell is back up and running better than before. And it only took a day! Actually the longest delay was making a fresh backup of the old system and data. I like my USB CDRW drive, but lordy lordy it ain't exactly barnstorming at 4x write speed.

       We Who Are About To Die Salute You...  I am taking a radical step today. My Windows 98 PC has become seriously rotten and unstable. Though I loathe the idea, it has become unavoidable. Time to wipe the hard drive and reinstall - everything. I am making a backup of documents, music and various setting right now. Soon the hard drive will be clean and ready for a fresh install. It's the reinstallation of all the other goodies that has me worried, Office, Visual Basic, MSDE, Direct X, Windows Updates. Ugh. My stomach churns at the thought. Hopefully I can finish it up before sundown.

       I was too twitchy to watch  urlLink the movie . It's filmed with digital cameras, and that is not a compliment. Lots of jerky, jittery hand-held camera action makes me uncomfortable. Maybe if I drank more beer...  Naw, it's that piss-water  urlLink Bud Light . Stuff's just abysmal. A can of fizzy rice water.  Oh yeah, I got rave reviews about  urlLink last night's crock pot meal  from a total stranger. While  urlLink Dianne  and I were eating, Kurt the tiling contractor showed up to fit in some granite accents in Dianne's new kitchen. He joined us for dinner and he couldn't stop raving about the taste of the food. He ate about three helpings. When I told him how easy it was to make the recipe he seemed impressed. Maybe another convert to the cult of the crock pot.   urlLink Bomb with Love...

       Today was my last day in temporary quarters, working out of boxes on folding tables and broken chairs. And it only took 10 months to get into a new office.  I'm psyched -  new furniture, computers, 100 megabit ethernet, new servers to play with, cool beans. Underground parking too. Coolness.  I spent the afternoon packing up my files and moving boxes around. I'm beat. Time to veg out with a movie and a cold beer.  Later

       Take a gander at  urlLink this fascinating article  about the dust cloud in our solar system, and what it means for astronomers searching for other solar systems. Basically our solar system looks like a gigantic dust doughnut with the sun in the center. The hole of the doughnut was scoured out by Jupiter and the other gas giants, and Neptune's gravity keeps the remaining dust cloud in check, far beyond our inner world's orbit. Astronomers are now looking for similar doughnuts around other stars.    urlLink     This image is just blows my mind. The four orbits are those of the gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Look at how Neptune is carving out a hole in the dust cloud. Also note how the density of the cloud clusters in two areas ahead and behind of Neptune. This is eerily reminiscent of Jupiter's  urlLink Trojan asteroids , viewable in this  urlLink APOD graphic  from last year. The Trojans are the blue dots on the edge of the photo, preceding and trailing Jupiter along the edges of the graphic - all that green stuff is the asteroid belt.   The same gravitational forces are in play, locking the dust into the same orbit at Neptune. I don't want to sound too geeky, but the dust  urlLink accumulates  in Neptune's L4 and L5  urlLink Lagrange Points,  stable orbits described by the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Lagrange indicated 5 semi-stable points in the orbit of one body around a larger one. L1 is on a line between the two bodies, L2 is on the same line, but beyond the second smaller body, L3 is located on that same imaginary line, but on the opposite side of the large center mass, and the L4 and L5 points precede and trail the smaller body. For the curious NASA's  urlLink SOHO solar observatory  sits in Earth's L1 point, staring down at the sun. This graphic illustrates the Lagrange points nicely.      I just get off on this stuff. The idea that our solar system has such a telltale signal bodes well for future explorations. This cannot locate earth like planets, but it can help pinpoint stable solar systems with gas giants located on the outskirts of systems. Currently methods can only discern gigantic rogue worlds, orbiting much too close to their parent star to harbor life.  I expect looking for dust clouds like this will become a standard technique in locating earth-like solar systems. Astronomers have already located a dust cloud around  urlLink Epsilon Eridani,  and they are studying it closely. Hopefully more stars will give up their secrets in the future.

       The  urlLink 2003 South Pacific Games  kicked off  urlLink yesterday in Fiji . Guam sent a small contingent this year. Guam hosted the Games in 1999, and it marked a high point on the island. Things have certainly dwindled since then, primarily due to the contracting economy. Sports organizations seem distracted and confused, especially since the typhoons last year. Many facilities were demolished by the typhoons and the funds are not present to rebuild. Gymnasiums, athletic fields, swimming pools and weight rooms still lie in ruin, a sad commentary on Guam's economic woes.

       Looking at cars and trucks wore me out this afternoon. I fled into the cool recesses of the Hafa Adai theater and enjoyed a $1.50 matinee of  urlLink  The Italian Job  . A pleasing little movie with the very easy on the eyes  urlLink Charlize Theron . I generally enjoy heist movies, and this was no exception.  Last night I polished off two Netflix DVD's that have been lying about for over a month,  urlLink  Jean de Florette   &  urlLink  Manon des Sources  . What a pair of movies. I cannot praise them enough.  Jean de Florette  is a more powerful film, as  urlLink Gerard Depardieu  is slowly and inexorably ground down to ruin by  urlLink Yves Montand  and  urlLink Daniel Auteuil . Depardieu inherits a small farm that the two men covet, and they go to great lengths to drive him off the land; blocking the small spring on the farm, casting aspersions about him in the village, and refusing to lend him vital aid when he needs it most. All the while, they play themselves off as Depardieu's only friends, every ready to supply him with a bottle of wine. At the beginning of the film Montand says that is is much easier to push a man downhill to ruin than to push against him. The conniving duo lead Deardieu down such a hill. The final scene is soul-numbing. Montand and Auteuil gleefully unplug the priceless spring after buying the farm on the cheap from Depardieu's widow. Depardieu's young daughter follows them into the trees and discovers they were the source of her father's downfall and howls an unworldly shriek of anguish. So chilling a depiction of duplicity, methodical cruelty and greed is rarely put onto film. Evil wins this round, but that little girl will have her vengeance.  The second film,  Manon des Sources , picks up the story ten years later. That little girl has grown into a beautiful young woman,  urlLink Emmanuelle Beart (hubba hubba). She wanders the hills, a lonely shepardess, shunning the villagers that stood idle while her family was destroyed. When she accidentally discovers the source of water for both the village and her nemeses Auteuil and Montand, she wreaks a powerful vengeance upon the entire community and sets in motion a chain of events that bring about the downfall of her enemies. This movie is quite good but not as gripping as the first film. It moves along briskly, coming to a shattering conclusion that leaves all evil doers punished. Beart is ridiculously beautiful, and Montand actually seems to collapse in on himself as his ruin draws closer. The tale of evil deeds and rightful vengeance plays out like Greek tragedy.  I first stumbled onto these movies 12 years ago. Flipping through the channels, I came upon  Jean de Florette  being aired on  urlLink my local PBS station . I was riveted to the television, mesmerized by the film. I've looked for it in vain since then, scouring video stores and retailers. I really enjoy  urlLink NetFlix , for exactly this reason. 17 year old films in French are not exactly leaping off the shelves at my local video store. NetFlix gives me a chance to watch some quality films that are not stocked on Guam. I just wish the turnaround on the DVD's was quicker, but that's a problem for the US Post, not NetFlix.

       Yesterday I admitted that I am a die-hard public radio listener.

       Apple announced their new  urlLink G5 PowerMacs  Monday. Hoochie Mama - I am suffering serious techno-lust right now. I want one of those dual 2.0 GHz babies something fierce. So does everyone else too, so maybe I can manage one next year. I know I can still milk my G3 for another year or so. But the old girl is starting to show her age. I've had the G3 for four years now, and I am still afraid to make the jump to OS X on that machine - she just doesn't have the oomph to run OS X, and I know it. So everyday the software and hardware on the G3 gets moldy and I find myself using my  urlLink Windows machine  more and more often. Hell, I am running  urlLink Radio Userland  on the Dell now, and that  urlLink cool panorama  I posted yesterday was  urlLink made on the Dell  too. I feel like my Macintosh cred is slipping.

        urlLink Marianas CableVision , the sole cable television provider on Guam, added  urlLink Fox News Channel  to their lineup yesterday. MCV dropped the only music video channel that actually still played music videos to add Fox News, the creaky  urlLink Soundtrack Channel . I can't say I am sorry to see the Soundtrack Channel go, but Fox News is not what I want to watch. Nothing like a little right wing vitriol spewing from my television. I watched a bit of it last night. Wow, I thought  urlLink CNN  was bad. Fox News seems to delight in pandering to the basest, crudest, most sensational news possible. I watched a bit where the talking meat puppets were earnestly discussing the best ways to 'take out' Saddam Hussein, then proceeded to mock Colin Powell's visit to Israel to spark a dialogue between the Israelis and Palestinians. I flipped off at that point and returned about a � hour later, to find the new talking head dissecting video footage of a bounty hunter capturing his prey, with color commentary provided by the bounty hunter.  So farewell Soundtrack Channel, your dull schedule of crappy video tie-ins is no more on Guam. Now we get the world according to Rupert Murdoch and his reactionary cronies.

       I finally got around to watching  urlLink  Black Robe   last night. I've have that particular  urlLink Netflix DVD  lying around since late April, but I never got around to watching it. I wonder why? It is a beautiful film, stunningly filmed and with a powerful message. Sometimes I think we haven't learned a damn thing in 400 years. I guess it is a depressing film at its heart; two cultures just cannot fathom each other and it leads to despair and death of all involved.  One thing that struck me though was the appearance of a manitou during several dream sequences. I can remember seeing the manitou on  urlLink Manitou Bluffs  overlooking the Missouri River. Quite a sight actually.

       Clicking through the myriad links I presented in the previous post, I stumbled upon Anatahan's somewhat lurid history. The island was home to a couple dozen shipwrecked Japanese fishermen and sailors during World War II, including one woman. The long isolation, close quarters primitive living conditions, and sexual jealousies reduced the number of castaways, frequently by knife fights between various suitors for the woman's affections. U.S. Forces knew about the holdouts on the island, but were unsuccessful in repatriating any of the Japanese.  urlLink They held out on their island fortress for six years , until the woman grew tired of island life in 1951 and flagged down a passing US vessel. The other survivors were soon persuaded to give up and return to Japan, marking the last formal surrender of WWII.  This misadventure was actually the subject of a movie made in 1953,  urlLink The Saga of Anatahan.   Oh yeah,  urlLink more cool pictures  I  urlLink found  at Wash U's web site.

       I found a couple cool websites with more preliminary information about the volcanic eruption on Anatahan last month.    urlLink Washington University's  page of  urlLink links regarding Anatahan.   The  urlLink MARGINS  page with  urlLink trip reports and photos  of Anatahan during geologist's visits in May. Very cool photos.  The  urlLink Hawaii Volcano Observatory  page with  urlLink photos  from a June 16 th  visit to Anatahan.  Great  urlLink images  of  urlLink Anatahan  taken by  urlLink astronauts aboard the International Space Station.    urlLink NASA  also posted some  urlLink satellite images  of the eruption on their  urlLink Visible Earth  site.  Wow. Some of those photos are really amazing, especially the photos of the abandoned village on Anatahan buried in ash. This plethora of information is a perfect example of the quality of information available on the internet, enabling knowledge for people around the world. It is amazing that all this information is so readily available.  FYI: The volcano continues to erupt and the island is still off limits according to the  urlLink CNMI Emergency Management Office.  A good reference for the current conditions is the  urlLink NOAA  GOES  (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite)   urlLink Guam sector web page , and the  urlLink Volcanic Ash Advisory Center.

       Do not shop at  urlLink Wal Mart , they are the fucking devil.  urlLink Evil, pure unadulterated evil . Just stay away. Buy local.  Low prices?  urlLink I recently read  how a woman with two children who worked full time at Wal Mart (itself a near impossibility) could not afford to house and feed her family, even if she only bought all her merchandise and groceries at Wal Mart. Most people that work at Wal Mart qualify for Food Stamps.  Those low prices are based on the suffering of millions and the shunting of costs onto the American public. Aggressive domination of the marketplace by  urlLink undercutting local merchants , providing  urlLink little benefits to employees  and  urlLink engaging in union busting practices , all the while running  urlLink miserable sweatshops overseas . Wal Mart is truly a corporation based on American ideals: rapacious greed and screwing it to the little guy, all the while draping themselves in the fraudulent veneer of patriotism and family values.   urlLink Do not shop at Wal Mart.

       Just call me lucky: My Isuzu was driving funny the last couple days, a wobble in the front passenger side. I took a look yesterday morning and I was shocked. The tire was literally coming apart, and the radial steel belts were exposed and frayed. Needless to say I changed that tire out right quick. I took some photos of the stricken tire too:         I was very lucky. A blow out while driving around would have totaled the SUV, and probably me too. I've been thinking about getting a new car, and this is a powerful impetus to get me into the showroom.

       I seem to be slowly leaking my political leanings onto this blog. Oops. I guess I just cannot deny my inner liberal anymore.   Latest goodie plucked from the internet, how an uppity black Congresswoman was  urlLink railroaded out of office  on the basis of a fabricated quote. Payback is a bitch, especially when you mess with Republicans and press of hearings on their back room shenanigans.   urlLink Here's the NPR story  that blew her out of the water. What was that about the  urlLink liberal media ? Yeah right. This is NPR pegged McKinney as a hothead, unstable, a 'looney.' Check out the August 21 report where Denise Majette, who beat McKinney, promises her district 'to not do anything to embarass you.' Sounds like a perfect Democratic congresswoman (to ensure Republican control of the House).

       Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way Kicking around on piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way  Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun  And you run and run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking And racing around to come up behind you again The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death  Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone the song is over, thought I'd something more to say...

First that bizarre fascination with  urlLink all things Jerry Lewis  and now this:  urlLink Woody Allen is appearing  in a series of commercials to promote French tourism. Who's bright idea was that? The man is an embarrassment now, and his imprimatur on something is not exactly a ringing endorsement for most Americans.

       Four years ago, the ancient kingdom of Bhutan became the  urlLink last place on earth with television , much of it supplied by Rupert Murdoch's  urlLink Star TV . Within four years, the once peaceful people of Bhutan and suffering under new phenomena: drugs and alcohol addiction, thievery, fraud, murder. Coincidence? What is the reaction of a Buddhist populace that believes in the sanctity of all life when exposed to wanton sex and violence? Television has a remarkable capacity to inform and bring our world together, but far too often the Lidless Eye speaks to our basest pleasures, dulling our senses and lowering our resistance.

       After my grumbling about the RAVE act last night I came across a  urlLink great article on Alternet , detailing the current government obsession with legislating away all fun. "The Second Prohibition" indeed. After railing against the RAVE act, the growing power of fundamentalist politicians, the federally funded 'abstinence' eduction and the everlasting shame of over 20,000 people locked up in our nation for marijuana offenses, the author sums it up nicely:   Sex and drugs and live music make life great. These are the kinds of things that were outlawed in Taliban-run Afghanistan. If they can't be legal and easy in America, then I don't want to live here anymore. I want to live in a place where drugs and sex are tolerated, where the government provides a sane level of social services, where religion isn't always threatening to take over the state. Amsterdam. It always comes back to Amsterdam.  Every day I feel like we are inching closer and closer to the fundamentalist dystopia portrayed in Margaret Atwood's   urlLink The Handmaid's Tale .  The fact that leading Republican Rick Santorum can spout off his repugnant views on the evils of homosexuality and the right of the government to control this kind of behavior - and not suffer any consequences deeply troubles me. John Ashcroft truly frightens me because I am certain he fantasizes about turning the United States into a Republic of Gilead. To head George Bush drops in code words and phrases ( urlLink 'there is power, wonder working power' ) during the State of the Union speech last January chilled me to my soul. The man actually believes God chose him to rule the nation. Uh, it wasn't God Dubya, it was Antonin Scalia and the Supreme Court. It certainly wasn't the majority of US voters.

       Somehow I think you won't hear this on the evenings news:  urlLink preliminary AP estimates Iraqi civilian deaths from the War On Iraq at 3,240.  And they doubt a complete count will ever be available. The part I really like was where the US military spokesman effectively shrugged off any responsibility for counting casualties. His answer was basically 'America doesn't kill civilians, so there is no need to make such a count. Besides, any civilians that might have died were caused by the Iraqi regime.'  God bless America -  'Blowin' up brown people since 1776!'

       Ray Bradbury's  urlLink Fahrenheit 451 , a chilling book about the not too distant future,  urlLink is 50 years old this year.  In many ways it has come to pass.

       Fifteen years ago I read a book about the coming environmental troubles. Prominent among these catastrophes was the collapse of the oceanic ecosystems due to over-fishing. Looks like we are rapidly  urlLink approaching that dark day . Two recent publications indicate the dire straits of the world's oceans due to pollution and over-fishing. In a letter  urlLink published in the journal Nature , Ransom Myers & Boris Worm detailed how large predatory  urlLink fish stocks have been depleted  to a tenth of their previous levels. The consequences could be severe for the ocean's ecosystem.    urlLink In a related publication , the Pew Oceans Commission details the increasing pressure on the world's oceans due to development, pollution, and overfishing. It looks grim, mostly because the damage done to the ocean is mostly invisible to humanity. All that salt water covering the devastation and prompting certain optimists to believe there is not problem at all with the oceans.   It just increases my sense of desperation. We are all damned. We were given an earthly paradise, a lonesome blue dot in the harsh and unforgiving universe, and we've fucked it up. Totally. We  urlLink tore a hole in the sky ,  urlLink pillaged the forests ,  urlLink stripped the mountains ,  urlLink poisoned the sea .    urlLink We broke the fucking sky . So many people on this planet, living in luxury or poverty, and we all think we are destined for a heavenly paradise after we die. Don't kid yourself. We are all damned. If a heavenly paradise exists, you can be certain not a single human being resides there.

       The Department of Public Works has begun  urlLink enforcing legislation regarding trash pickup . In 1998 a public law was enacted that required homeowners to place their garbage in trash cans smaller than 35 gallons. I remember this event. The reason was given was the poor garbagemen were throwing out their backs lifting enormous loads of trash into the garbage trucks.   Fine with me. No problemo. I just wish DPW would concentrate on implementing a recycling strategy and closing the Ordot Landfill. That is the real emergency that the department needs to address.

I guess that check I wrote for $30 at the beginning of this month was in vain with that bunch of idiots. I swear GTA is the millstone of incompetency around the neck of GovGuam.

       I ate lunch on Sunday afternoon at Santa Fe on the Bay Hotel. It pretty much sucked; it was hot and still, the food was not very good, and a swarm of flies harassed us the entire time. It was an unpleasant meal, and I commented at the time how it was a wonder the place stayed open.   Guess I spoke too soon.  urlLink The next day the hotel shut its doors , closing down the beachfront restaurant and tossing all the guests out the door. The place has been in and out of bankruptcy several times the past few years, so this development didn't surprise me. The new owners offered no reason for the shut-down, but the hotel sustained damage in last year's typhoons and needed extensive repairs.  I'll go ahead and start up a rumor too: Last year I met a couple television writers that were developing a series about a hotel on Guam. They were very interested in Santa Fe on the Bay as the possible location for their TV show. Maybe they vetted the series to a network and this shutdown is the first step in converting the hotel into a television set?

       Yesterday's excitement in Manila  urlLink raised concerns on Guam  about the stability of the island nation's government and the safety of relatives. Guam is tightly bound to the Philippines by bonds of history, geography, and family. Fully 40% of Guam's population is Filipino, and they contribute immensely to the life and diversity of the island.  This latest unrest in the Philippines underscores long running problems in that nation. The continuing insurgency in Mindanao and the southern islands is sapping the nation's sense of security and pride. Filipinos never forget they were once a colony of the United States, and the presence of U.S. military advisors on Filipino soil deeply rankles many in the government and military. Add to that a long history of abuse and corruption by the military and national police, and the  urlLink government of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo seems a little unsteady.  She has already survived a several crises though, and it appears that yesterday's situation was resolved peacefully.

         Did I mention my parents saw the Archbishop of the  urlLink Archdioceses of Agana  in St. Louis last month? Well they did. Hell, I probably mentioned it last month already.

A real scene-stealer, she nailed her performance dead to rights. I'll keep an eye out for her in the future.  Took the new PT Cruiser round for a spin today. It's nice owning a new car. It looks good, it runs good, it smells new. I think the best part is the freedom from worry and anxiety that the old Isuzu injected into my life. "Will it break down or get me in an accident? What's it going to cost me this time to get it running again?" And the worst part? Well I am a lot poorer now, and I will be making payments for a few years. That always sucks. But I am glad I did it. No regrets, no worries.  I'm actually looking forward to going into work tomorrow. The onus of dealing with the important projects is off for the rest of the year. It will start up again next year, but I've got about five months now to work on projects that really interest me, instead of running an endless series of analyses on healthcare costs and trends, producing claim triangles, or calculating  urlLink IBNR  lag files. We're doing some major upgrades to our core business software, and also upgrading our servers. We've also gotten the green light to build a data warehouse, something I've been hollering about for over a year now. It's time to have some fun and try some new stuff.

       After many moons, the weary office worker looks up from his cubicle to discover the myriad impossible projects are completed. The sense of urgency and impending doom has lifted, the late hours and weekends spent in the office are finally at an end, the weight of the company lifted from his sagging shoulders.   The promise of free time, disposable time, tantalizing the haggard man, a siren call of possibilities, awaits out-of-doors. Paddling, scuba diving, hiking, cycling, reading, playing music, hanging out in pubs drinking beer; a world of fruitful and meaningful activities beckons beyond the door. He has only to step outside...  But the many-headed Hydra rears it's ugly heads. Long abandoned projects, tabled and almost forgotten, make themselves known. Word spreads among the other cubicle denizens of his availability, and promises made when the world was younger. No rest for the weary is the credo of this murder of crows. The cubicle beckons, the work demands completion. His head bowed, the office worker turns to the soft glow of his flat panels and starts working again.

        urlLink Careful: The FB-eye may be watching   A freelance writer gets a visit from the FBI regarding his links to terrorism. Turns out he was denounced by somebody that noticed him reading an editorial in line at a coffee shop. In a perverse irony, the editorial was sharply critical of Fox News, the growing climate of fear and the Orwellian group-think that has gripped the nation since 9/11. The FBI came to his workplace and interrogated him about his activities and acquaintances, and requested information about the offending article.

       Found an  urlLink interesting transcript  of an interview by  urlLink Bill Moyers  last week.  urlLink Jon Stewart of the Daily Show  was the guest, and the interview focused on the sorrowful state of the media. Stewart was adamant in his stance as a political satirist, which is why it was poignant to here Moyers describe him as one of the most truthful commentators on television today. Stewart had a number of good things to say about the way media cowtows to the administration:  Politicians... understand that 24-hour news networks.. they don't have time for journalism. They only have time for reporting. They only have time to be handed things and go, this is what I've just been handed by the administration. And they read it. He also had a less than flattering comparison between how George W. and Tony Blair handle questions and critics:  You know what's great? Watch a Bush press conference, and then turn on Tony Blair and Parliament. Where he literally has to sit in front of his most vociferous critic. And that critic will say, "Sir, on the 13th, the dossier of the French...would not...the nuclear... You were hiding things. How do you answer, sir?"  "The distinguished gentleman is wrong. I can prove it in this way."  Contrast that with the press conference that Bush had on the eve of war. "Uh, okay, the next question is Jim. Is there a Jim here? Yeah. You got the next one."  "That is not the agreed upon question. We're gonna move on. Ralph, you got something?" It's an incredibly managed theatrical farce. And it's incredible to me that people are playing along with it. And they say that they're playing along with it because they're afraid of losing access. You don't have any access! There's nothing to lose!

       Wow.  urlLink Two top Hong Kong officials resigned yesterday  in direct response to the massive protests that have rocked the city for the last couple weeks. Can the resignation of Tung Chee-Hwa be far behind?   It is exciting watching these protests bring about peaceful regime change. The Philippines did it a few years ago, and now Hong Kong appears to be in the midst of its own political awakening. I wonder if something like this would work in the United States?  In other regional news,  urlLink North Korea exchanged gunfire with South Korean positions  across the DMZ today. That makes me very anxious.  The South Korean military said the North Koreans fired four rounds from a machine gun at one of its posts along the DMZ.   It said South Korean troops broadcast a warning through loudspeakers and then returned fire with 17 shots. There were no reported casualties.  I can think of nothing more likely to erupt into a full-scale war than the situation with North Korea right now. It's too bad President Bush prefers to take out weak demagogues like Hussein instead of a real threat like North Korea.

       The A.B. Won Pat International Airport is  urlLink moving ahead with plans to lay off employees . The airport plans to cut $3.5 million from its annual payroll of $11 million.   Wow, that's a hefty chunk of the airport's staff on the chopping block. I suspect the layoffs will be challenged before the Civil Service Commission, and probably a few terminations cancelled. Par for the course. It is a noteworthy effort to reduce GovGuam's bloated payroll though.

       Every day U.S. forces are coming under attack in Iraq. Pretty violent place, even after Saddam Hussein was ousted.  urlLink 33 U.S. and U.K. soldiers have been killed since President Bush declared hostilities over on May 1 . Guess he got that one wrong too. First he has to make up excuses to attack a third world country, and now he cannot tell the difference between violence and peace.     The new U.S. general in Iraq, General John Abizaid, termed the conflict in Iraq a  urlLink 'classic guerrilla-type campaign'  in an interview today. That's for damn sure.

       I left for Tokyo at noon on Friday. Took the Narita Express into Shinjuku then headed out to Asagaya, where I stayed at the  urlLink Hotel Amista . The hotel was nice, quiet, serviceable.  I thought the wedding was going to be a quick civil ceremony. I was wrong. It was a full-on Shinto wedding ceremony, a first for me. I took some pictures of the shrine. It was hot out. Very hot and muggy.         After the ceremony we headed off to the reception at  urlLink Museum Tokyo . It was hot there. Very hot. I think 'sweat lodge' is a good description. It was a good time though, a couple bands played, a magician did some tricks, and the beer flowed freely. Nothing wrong with that. I did bail early from the party though - I desperately needed a cold shower.  Sunday I helped David and Keiko clean up at Museum Tokyo, then I got a quick tour of  urlLink where David works . David lives in  urlLink Tachikawa City , and I got the tour of his new home too. Then it was off to downtown Tokyo for some sightseeing and dinner.        It was a good little trip. I am looking forward to going back sometime soon.

       I polished off the newest novel about Harry Potter last weekend.  urlLink Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  was okay, about par for the course as Harry Potter novels go. The formula is getting a little stale at this point: Harry's stuck with his tedious family over summer, magic upsets the Dursley household right as Harry leaves, a new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher stirs the pot at Hogwarts, Harry and his friends disregard the advice of the adults around them, Harry catches the Golden Snitch in a Quidditch match, Harry gets in tune with Voldemort's evil plans, nobody believes Harry, Harry wanders into the Forbidden Forest, Harry gets into a scrape with Voldemort, some mysterious power inside Harry that he can neither understand nor control thwarts Voldemort again, Dumbledore explains what just happened, Harry goes back to the Dursley's wiser and older. Repeat cycle in another couple years.  I enjoyed the book, it is a delightful children's series. Anything that gets kids excited about reading is okay by me. The stories are enjoyable fantasy, a quick bit of fluff. I am certain I will read the sixth book in the series when it comes out, and it will again be a brief delight in my reading.

       The bones unearthed during the road work on Route 4 a few months ago are  urlLink still lying exposed along the roadside  in Yona. The entire situation is simply intolerable. Desecration of burials, then simply allowing the graves to be scattered by wind, rain and foraging animals. It is simply scandalous.  By the time they  urlLink finally sort out the mess and approve an archaeologist to excavate the site  it will be too late. The damage has been done.

       The rainy season has officially arrived. It was a deluge last night, non-stop, pounding rain for over an hour. This morning the winds were gusting and the scuttlebutt was about a tropical depression forming over the island. Judging by the  urlLink satellite photo loop , Guam will be getting lots of rain for the next few days.

       Got back late this afternoon from Tokyo. It was a blast. The weather was really hot the first couple days, but it cooled off nicely Saturday night.   I will post some pictures in a day or so. Right now I am trying to play catch up around the house. The wedding was great, the parties were great. I drank a good deal, met some interesting people, and explored a bit of Tokyo. I hope to get back before the end of the year. Hopefully it won't be so blasted hot in October.

        urlLink  Approved by the National Assembly of France, August 26, 1789    The representatives of the French people, organized as a National Assembly, believing that the ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities and of the corruption of governments, have determined to set forth in a solemn declaration the natural, unalienable, and sacred rights of man, in order that this declaration, being constantly before all the members of the Social body, shall remind them continually of their rights and duties; in order that the acts of the legislative power, as well as those of the executive power, may be compared at any moment with the objects and purposes of all political institutions and may thus be more respected, and, lastly, in order that the grievances of the citizens, based hereafter upon simple and incontestable principles, shall tend to the maintenance of the constitution and redound to the happiness of all. Therefore the National Assembly recognizes and proclaims, in the presence and under the auspices of the Supreme Being,  urlLink the following rights of man and of the citizen : Articles:   Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.  The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.  The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation.  Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law.  Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one may be forced to do anything not provided for by law.  Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to all public positions and occupations, according to their abilities, and without distinction except that of their virtues and talents.  No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. Any one soliciting, transmitting, executing, or causing to be executed, any arbitrary order, shall be punished. But any citizen summoned or arrested in virtue of the law shall submit without delay, as resistance constitutes an offense.  The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except it be legally inflicted in virtue of a law passed and promulgated before the commission of the offense.  As all persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty, if arrest shall be deemed indispensable, all harshness not essential to the securing of the prisoner's person shall be severely repressed by law.  No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.  The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.  The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to whom they shall be intrusted.  A common contribution is essential for the maintenance of the public forces and for the cost of administration. This should be equitably distributed among all the citizens in proportion to their means.  All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by their representatives, as to the necessity of the public contribution; to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put; and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection and the duration of the taxes.  Society has the right to require of every public agent an account of his administration.  A society in which the observance of the law is not assured, nor the separation of powers defined, has no constitution at all.  Since property is an inviolable and sacred right, no one shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity, legally determined, shall clearly demand it, and then only on condition that the owner shall have been previously and equitably indemnified.

       A quick spin through the local news:    urlLink  Bankruptcies on the rise   - No surprise there. George Butler, a local lawyer specializing in bankruptcies, predicts 2003 will be a banner year for bankruptcy filings on Guam, especially once the inevitably happens and GovGuam starts laying off employees.   urlLink  Arguments heard in bond case   - The Supreme Court of Guam heard arguments for and against the government's proposed bond bailout measure yesterday. They will render a decision in a few days.   urlLink  State funeral set for Angel Santos   - Next week a state funeral will be held for former senator Angel Santos. I still can't believe he is gone. The media reported him as having Parkinson's, but it seems like the progress of the disease was incredibly fast. I've known a few people with Parkinson's and it always seemed a gradual deterioration to me. I know the medical examiner performed an autopsy, I am curious to know the results.   urlLink  Public library reducing hours   - The Agat Branch of the Guam Public Library is now only open on Tuesdays. Seems the salary reductions and budget shortfalls encouraged a number of library employees to leave Guam. The library is now too short-staffed to operate the main branch, the Dededo branch and the Agat branch every day. The poor state of the library system on island breaks my heart.   urlLink  Tire recycling takes off   -  On a positive note, a local recycling firm unveiled a new process to reduce the number of old tires on island. The new machine crushes up to 100 old tires into a compact 4x4x2 cube, which can be used for a number of purposes; road beds, retaining walls or erosion control. Good to hear about somebody doing something to reduce waste on island.   urlLink  South Pacific Games Update   -  urlLink FSM earned seven medals yesterday  ::  urlLink Guam men bat in the baseball gold  ::  urlLink Guam women's soccer still in medal contention  :: All in all,  urlLink the games are a rousing success for Fiji .

       The ride into town this morning was interesting for a couple reasons. I've mentioned  urlLink the highway construction  on my  urlLink stretch of Route 4  before; 10 months into the road widening project and all  urlLink they've done is dig ditches . Well this morning they were busy trenching again and broke the water main. It must have just happened a minute or two before I passed by. The water was shooting up like a fountain 5 feet into the air and two contractors were busy yelling at each other. It was a pretty funny scene, looked like something out of the  urlLink Three Stooges .  Then I spotted the elusive  urlLink illustrated man  this morning too. Yes, Von was pedaling a bike up Marine Drive at 8:00 this morning, destination unknown. It's been about four months since I've seen Von, I was hoping that he finally got his ducks in a row and left Guam. I guess I was wrong. I'll give him a call next week and hook up. Anyway it was funny seeing a bald, tattooed biker in steel toe boots and bandanna wobbling up the middle of Marine Drive.

       Knocked off  Bleak House  at lunch today. Another notch in the staff of reading. Time to start the latest Harry Potter, which I have on loan from  urlLink Dianne .  I ate lunch at GPO - Guam Premium Outlets. Just a quick bite to eat, a Subway sandwich in the food court. Then it was up into the stores and a stop at Vitamin World for my glucosamine supplements. Gotta keep the creaky knees lubed up.   I discovered that the  urlLink Guam Museum  opened a small exhibit space in an empty store front in the mall. The exhibit is entitled "A Brief Glimpse Into Guam's History" and it offers several cases of ancient Chamoru artifacts; a latte stone, sling stones, metate, and fishhooks. Also on display is a variety of objects relating to  urlLink Shoichi Yokoi , the famous Japanese straggler found hiding out down in Talofofo in 1972. They have his homespun hibiscus root clothing, some wrought tools and salvaged garbage that he used to eke out a living in his cave.  All said this is a nice effort by the museum to reach a wider audience and highlight Guam's history to the tourists. This is certainly a step in the right direction, though  urlLink the needs of the museum  need to be  urlLink sorely addressed .

       Today's featured editorial in the PDN discusses the similar histories, yet different outcomes, of  urlLink Guam and Singapore . Both were distant island territories with similar advantages, but Singapore ended up an economic powerhouse while Guam is mired in fiscal chaos and a crumbling infrastructure. What were the differences that caused such divergent outcomes? The author cites a common thread in the 'Asian Tigers'  Existing special circumstances, such as entrepots in Hong Kong and Singapore built by their colonial masters; a shared Confucian heritage of hard work, frugality, hierarchy and harmony; an embrace of a free-market economy; and economic planning based on a market-driven and export-oriented economy.  While he goes to lengths to explain the parallels in Guam's history that could produce a similar 'Pacific Tiger' on our island, he ends his analysis there. Any discussion on the failures of Guam's economy should include a lengthy discussion of the military's pervasive presence on the island.  For decades Guam has hosted several major military bases, serving as a tangible projection of U.S. military might into the Far East. The Navy developed a great deal of Guam's infrastructure, and ran the island as a colonial power for decades. Power, water, telephone, even the government itself was entirely under naval administration. The damaging effects of this policy are only too clear: Guam has become dependent on others, most notably the military, survival.  How does the saying go? 'If you give a man a fish, he eats for a day; if you teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime.' Whether overtly or not, the military kept Guam dependent on the federal largesse.  These habits rubbed off on the nascent GovGuam when self-rule finally occurred in the 1960's. GovGuam kept this paternalistic attitude and maintained control of all the major utilities. Over time, the function of GovGuam become not to provide basic services and duties of a government, but to provide cradle to grave employment, health care, and benefits. It made an island of dependents.  Why take chances or innovate when a cushy government job with generous salaries provides all a person needs? The impetus was not present to spur economic diversity. Guam was given a fish every day, and never learned to fish for itself. And so the island stagnated, a vassal territory to a world superpower, while the Asian Tigers surged ahead to become economic powerhouses.

       I just realized I made a mistake this evening. I left my  urlLink Psion  at work. Normally this wouldn't bother me too much, but I am only five chapters from the end of  urlLink  Bleak House  , which is stowed on the Psion in a text file I downloaded from the  urlLink Project Gutenberg . Crap.   Oh wait - it's on my hard drive here too. I can read it from my computer this evening and finish the novel. Cool! I really enjoy pulling down old novels from Project Gutenberg - a vast digital library at my fingertips.  Onto Dickens, I really do enjoy Dickens. His stories contain a wealth of unforgettable characters, which often causes the plot to slow down in the first half of the book. But as the plot speeds up, Dickens throws in the most remarkable connections and coincidences to throw his characters together. As the conclusion nears, I can rarely put down the story. I was up until 3:00 last night reading  Bleak House , and I will probably stay up tonight until I finish it.  Well before it gets too late, I am off to watch a DVD now.  urlLink  'Round Midnight   is on the docket for this evening. Been a long time since I've seen this homage to jazz, but I am looking forward to it. Hell, any movie with Dexter Gordon jammin' like mad is worth sitting back and watching.

       The Malesso Choir Association is back in business!  urlLink Bingo games resumed earlier this month  as the group tries to raise cash to pay off $400,000 it owes the government. Maybe they should have filed statements with the Department of Revenue & Taxation for the last 2 years.  The Malesso Choir Association is not affiliated with the Archdioceses of Agana, but they donate all their earnings to the construction of a new church and rectory in Merizo. That's pretty convenient setup for the Church, which vehemently opposes legalized gambling. I guess the good friars don't want anybody horning in on their racket.

       Lawmakers caved in yesterday and  urlLink repealed the privatization of school cafeteria and maintenance workers . Bill 53 cancels the cost-cutting measures introduced in the governor's budget. Political expediency wins out. Voting was along party lines, with Democrats voting for the bill and Republicans voting against.  I hate to see anybody lose their jobs, but the fact remains that GovGuam will have to cut its workforce. There just isn't enough money to go around. Everyone agrees that GovGuam must reduce the number of employees but no one is willing to actually make the necessary cuts.

       Call me out of date, but I just heard about the U.S. Army distributing a  urlLink 'top-notch shooter' video game  for free as a recruiting tool. 'America's Army' sends the player through training and team building exercises before launching them into missions designed to give the player a taste of military life. I am download the mammoth game right now to check it out. I must say this glorification of violence and warfare freely available from the U.S. government for children to download troubles me, but I can also see the brilliancy of creating a game to encourage military service among the video game generation.  I will discuss this in more detail once I take the game for a test drive.

       Pacific Daily News columnist recounts her travel experiences during her recent family vacation, and she finds the new restrictions  urlLink more a nuisance and knee jerk reaction  than providing actual security. I couldn't agree more - the security measures are paranoid reactions to the attacks that do little to thwart future terrorist attempts. If/when the United States is attacked again, it will not come from airplanes. The attack will focus on a forgotten weak spot: Bombing chemical plants in large cities perhaps, or crippling the nation's railway infrastructure.  Her final comment is particularly poignant. Yes, we are doing a bang-up job dismantling all those freedoms the terrorists loathe in the name of security and I am certain we are not leaving our children a battered legacy.

       I just checked the headlines of the PDN and discovered that  urlLink Angel Santos died yesterday . It is a sad day on Guam. I can think of no other publice figure that was as honest and open about Guam's problems and dedicated to helping those in need. I knew he was in failing health and had Parkinson's, but this was unexpected. He was only 44.    urlLink He was an activist, a senator and a major public figure.  He was hugely popular, and seen as a defender of the common man on Guam. He ran for governor in 1998, and I often think the island would have been a much better place if he had won the gubernatorial race.  My condolences to the family of former Senator Angel Santos.

       Got into work at 4:00 this morning. Dropped the truck off at the airport and rode my bike down to the office. I learned one important thing - I will not be riding the bike anymore. I am going to rent a car for a few days and use that to commute about.   So why the change of heart? I'm a big man in poor shape. Riding 22 miles a day will kill me. And not just exhaustion from cycling, it is truly, deeply uncomfortable to be on the bike. In the two or three miles from the airport to the office my feet hurt, my knees were killing me and I couldn't put my weight onto my butt without excruciating pain. Of course that only made my knees and feet hurt even more. I knew there was no way I could manage 11 miles each way in that much pain.   So the great experiment fails. Basically I need to close the deal on my new car today.

       I am supposed to drop off the truck I've been driving for the last four days at the airport tonight. Someone else needs the wheels and I am relegated back to my bicycle for a few days.   I got two options:   Drop the truck off tonight, bike 8 miles home to Yona and bike 10 miles into work tomorrow morning.  Drop the truck off really early and coast on the bike a few miles downhill to my job.  Guess which one I am thinking of doing? Yep, old option B is the course for me.  The only problem with this:  urlLink the flight arrives at 4:00 am  - as ungodly an hour as there is. I guess I will be heading to bed early tonight.

       I spent most of the past week looking at cars, trucks, SUV's and even one of those motorized  urlLink 'Scoot Cars.'  I am 95% certain I know what  urlLink I am getting . Yeah, my own little  retro-hearse . I got my eye on one that is a  urlLink little more than I need , but what the hell - live a little. It's not like I buy a new car every year - it's not like I've ever bought a new car period. So why not enjoy myself?   I only know one thing: I am not interesting in another SUV. I've come to dislike the behemoths of the highway in the last couple years, especially as the oversized land-yachts took over the market - Lincoln Navigators, Ford Expeditions, Toyota Sequoias and that monster Escalade from Cadillac inspire me to say "BLEEEEECH." Luxury SUV? WTF? To say nothing of the abysmal gas mileage these cushy, bloated barges get. Never mind.   The smaller SUV's don't excite me either. They look like they couldn't go up the driveway to my house they're so tiny and anemic. RAV-4's, Passports and that stuff just look like slightly larger versions of the compact cars they are based on. No real utility in those things.   I liked my old Isuzu because it was a stripped down, go anywhere utility vehicle: beach, hills, roads - it didn't matter to the Isuzu. I just bounced along and got where I was going. About the closest thing I've driven that compares is the Nissan XTerra. It's a tempting ride and I like the vehicle, I'd put it at my #2 choice.   The other ride that attracted me was just a Toyota pickup. Can't be beat. Reliable, cheap, useful. Hell I'm driving one right now for a week and I have no complaints. I consider this my intelligent safe choice. But driving around in a pickup doesn't really interest me.  I thought long and hard about what kind of driving I do and the fact is my off-roading days are over. I drive to work, I drive home. I drive to work, I drive to the store, I drive home. That's about it these days. I need a car for commuting and shopping, not a SUV, not a truck. A car. And if it has to be a car, why not live a little and get a fun car? I think this line of reasoning is sensible, but fun and I expect to buy the car tomorrow or Tuesday morning.

       Last July 4 th   urlLink I was busy battening down the hatches for a typhoon . Typhoon Chata'an struck on Friday July 5 th , and left a wake of destruction in it's path. Power was out for weeks,  some friends lost their homes and livelihoods, thousands were laid off in the economic slump following the storm and even my office was destroyed by the winds. I guess this is about when things went sour for 2002. The island was just recovering from Chata'an when Super-Typhoon Pongsona delivered a knock-out blow in December. The island is still coming to grips with that disaster.

        urlLink Astronomers announced  the discovery of the first star outside our sun to possess a planet in a stable, circular orbit. All the previously detected planets were so called 'hot Jupiters,' oversized gas giants in highly elliptical orbits close to their parent star. These giants are considered inimicable to life because they would disrupt the orbits of smaller, terrestrial worlds with their erratic orbits.  The newly discovered planet is in a stable, circular orbit roughly the same distance as Jupiter is from the sun. Jupiter's position in the solar system is considered crucial for the development of life on earth. Scientists term Jupiter the solar system's cosmic outfielder, snagging wayward asteroids and comets that might threaten to extinguish life on earth. This discovery raises the chances of someday imaging an earth-like world.

       All hail the gutless Guam Legislature.  urlLink They lack the will to enact a pay cut , even when there is no money to pay people. They know that if they enact this legislation, they will be out of a job in 18 months. And this is exactly why nothing good ever happens here - fear of the GovGuam employee voting bloc. It's as if they hoped the voters would forget how they increased taxes earlier this year because they couldn't stomach laying off some GovGuam deadweight.

        urlLink Monday was an especially bloody day on Guam , with one boy accidentally killed and another seriously wounded in a poaching accident on US Air Force property, and another man stabbed to death in a bar fight in the village of Dededo.  The poaching incident is especially sad. A group of men and boys were out poaching in the jungle on  urlLink Andersen Air Force Base , when a gun discharged and hit both boys. The group attempted to haul the wounded kids back to their vehicles, but dropped the bodies, hid and fled the scene when Air Force military police arrived.  The stabbing appears to be a case of drunken fools staring each other down at a bar. They took their beef outside and one fellow got sliced up pretty bad. The murder rate has really spiked in the last month, from two in May to seven on July 1. And the real hardships have yet to strike home for most folks on Guam. I am worried what will happen when GovGuam finally starts laying people off.

       My apologies for not posting local news here lately. I try to only comment on political imbroglios, and the current situation is unchanged from a few months ago: the governor is still trying  urlLink to float a massive bond , the Attorney General  urlLink is still dead-set against it , GovGuam workers are still being  urlLink furloughed  or forced into  urlLink wage reductions , the Republican senators are still trying to  urlLink repeal the tax increase  the Democratic senators approved earlier this year and  urlLink visitor arrivals are plunging  to 10 year lows.  On a more sordid note, the last two months brought about a rash of murders on the island. In the last two weeks two women were stabbed to death in crimes of passion. In the  urlLink first murder  a woman came home to find her boyfriend in bed with another woman. Police found the first woman with a knife through her heart and arrested the second woman.  urlLink A grand jury sprung her  late last week though due to lack of evidence.   urlLink The second knife murder  was a crime of passion too. A woman was at a local bar with her ex-boyfriend when her cell phone rang. She refused to let the ex-boyfriend see the caller id number, and he allegedly flew into a rage, grabbed a knife off the bar and stabbed her.  Crikey! There was  urlLink another stabbing  at a karaoke lounge last night! This is becoming a little too common. Perhaps the stress of a contracting economy is overwhelming people.

       So my Macintosh is acting strangely. Nothing terminal, just odd behavior. I am getting errors booting up, web pages won't display properly in  urlLink Mozilla , I can't get streaming audio to work in  urlLink Audion . A lot of little quibbling problems, the sort of stuff that plagues five year old G3's I guess.  Time to run a  urlLink Norton Utilities , maybe defrag the hard drive. Probably have to reinstall some odds 'n ends that have gone sour. Hope this doesn't turn into a major production, I don't need that right now.  Oh yeah - picked up an old Pentium Pro machine to play around with yesterday. I shrugged off the offer of a keyboard and mouse. "I've got a  urlLink KVM  switch," I casually replied. "No worries about that for me." Of course the keyboard and mouse jacks on the old PC are  urlLink DB-9  serial and  urlLink DIN-5  connectors, and my KVM switch is  urlLink PS/2  type plugs. Lovely.

I skipped work, the prospect of limping up and down four flights of steps kept me at home. What the heck, I got plenty of sick leave, time to use a day and recuperate. My knee is still wobbly, but the pain is reduced from last night. Guess I'm working tomorrow.  Today's eerie image:      urlLink  Tomb Raider Chronicles   dates itself with this vista. I had to stop and take a screenshot of the beautiful skyline, now lost forever.

       No, not the great  urlLink Rolling Stones  album,  urlLink one of my favorites  by the way. I mean actual flowers blooming on my doorstep.

Since then the plumeria has peaked and started to brown, the aloe is still going strong, and that cactus thing bloomed during the night and the flower was wilted the next day. I think the plant is a  urlLink pitaya , a cactus that produces a fruit. I've never seen it bloom before in six years, so I am uncertain. But the flower sure looked like the flowers on the pitayas  urlLink on this page . I've never seen another on Guam, so I guess I won't be seeing those spectacular fruit anytime soon. I had some in Vietnam, it was delicious.

       A juvenile mountain lion was recently  urlLink struck by a motorist outside Fulton, MO .

       Yep, the power went down for about a half hour, precisely at 9:00 am. I simply do not understand why the Guam Power Authority only works on the utility poles on the weekends.

I could barely walk last night.  My  urlLink fantasy football draft  is in a couple hours. I am aiming for complete dominance this year. Of course I didn't do much studying or prep work.

       I think the power is schedule to go off in about two minutes. I so enjoy having the power shut off every weekend.

       After watching  Equilibrium  last night, I watched my other movie that was due back at Blockbuster today.   urlLink  Rapa Nui   is a ridiculous movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. The story of high adventure, class warfare and romance on Easter Island before the arrival of Europeans is a flimsy concoction. But I like it. Maybe the hundreds of bare-chested women milling about has something to do with it. Or maybe its the hilarious dialogue, especially between the high priest and aged king. But once the climactic race starts to retrieve an undamaged bird's egg from a nearby island, all complaints melt away. It's exciting, even if it doesn't make much sense.  The movie is a guilty pleasure. Hell, even  urlLink Roger Ebert admits  to that.

       Just finished watching  urlLink  Equilibrium  , a sci-fi action movie that several guys at work recommended I watch. They said it was reminiscent of  urlLink  the Matrix  , but I was sorely disappointed. Think  1984  with some gunfighting kung fu thrown in. The only good moment was when Taye Diggs got his face sliced off in a sword fight. That was pretty cool. Otherwise, the action was sparse, and the plot predictably boring.  One odd moment right now:  urlLink Christian Bale , the stony faced protagonist in Equilibrium, was the kid in  urlLink  Empire of the Sun  . That's weird. I remember watching that movie when it came out, was it really that long ago?

       So the computer system was down again today, for the third day in a row. All those Windows 2000 desktops and servers, humbled by the onslaught of lowly virii, just a few lines of malicious code. The entire network was switched off today, then slowly brought back online, one machine at a time. I feel for the network guys, they are working double time just to stem the tide. First Blaster, then Nachi, now Sobig. It's a bad week to be a MCSE.  I spent the day reading more technical manuals and killing time in a few meetings.

The  urlLink Citizens for Economic Diversity  already have enough signatures to place the measure on the ballot during the next general election, but that isn't until November 2004. If the island senators pass this bill, a special election will be held within 90 days to decide the future of gambling on Guam.  Terlaje insists casino gambling is a way to ease the suffering of many people on Guam, by spurring construction and increasing tourism. I couldn't agree more. This island desperately needs something to attract investment, and regulated, quality casinos offer a way out of this economic malaise that we cannot seem to shrug off.

       We got nailed by the  urlLink Nachi or Welchia worm  at work today. Work ground to a halt and several departments went home before noon. Needless to say, it was a lost cause doing anything that involved the network, so I spent the day organizing my filing cabinet, archiving old data onto CD-R's, and reading some technical manuals. I actually enjoyed the break from routine, and the odd stroll down memory lane when I had to distribute some files to people via floppy disks. Wow - going old school.

       I mentioned watching Whale Rider this weekend, I also found time for a couple DVD's:    urlLink  The Quiet American   - This was a real sleeper early this year. It never even opened on Guam, which surprised me. The movie was a murder mystery, a love triangle, a political thriller, a chilling forewarning of the years to come. Highly recommended. The movie downplayed the religious themes that Greene's novel wove into the story, which I found interesting.   urlLink  Solaris   - Another movie which never made it to Guam. A slow, elegiac film about loss, redemption and despair aboard a space station orbiting a distant world. Not for everyone, but certainly a quality film with some real thought and emotion. I might have to read the book at some point in the future.  That's it. I'll finally watch  urlLink  Apocalypse Now   in the next couple days, offering a wild, violent counterpoint to  The Quiet American's  subdued message. I've had  Apocalypse Now  for several months (Thanks  urlLink Netflix !!) but never had the energy to submit myself to it. I think it's time though.

          The big storm this weekend wasn't so big after all.  urlLink About 3 inches fell on Sunday , but winds never reached tropical storm strength. By 3:00 yesterday afternoon, the clouds were breaking up and patches of blue sky were visible.  This is actually a fairly dry August. Only a little over six inches has fallen  urlLink this month . Last year Guam received over 20 inches of rainfall in  urlLink August .

       Robert Cringely puts out an  urlLink interesting editorial on outsourcing in the IT world . What really caught my eye though, was the paragraphs he devotes to the problems of getting Macintosh and OS X accepted in the workplace. Macs are just as powerful at Windows or Linux, offer powerful capabilities built into BSD Unix, are actually easier to use on a network, and are definitely easier for the end users to operate. He attributes the lackluster sales to the "IT Department Full Employment Act" - IT professionals aren't going to recommend a computer that will eliminate the need for their jobs now are they? It's in the IT staff's interest to deploy buggy software like Windows, or impossibly complex software like Linux. The install systems that maintain their priestly condition, hierophants to the digital pantheon. Interesting idea.

       Just got back from watching  urlLink Whale Rider  with Dianne and the family Hendricks. It was definitely the best movie I've seen all year. It lived up to my expectations and more. That young girl,  urlLink Keisha Castle-Hughes , really knocked one out of the ballpark with her performance. She carried the weight of that film on her shoulders, really portraying the strength and fragility of this little girl. Wow. I highly recommend this movie.  And if you live on Guam, hurry up and see this movie. I don't imagine it will last very long at the movie theaters. There was maybe ten people in the theater today, including the five of us. It's not exactly the kind of thing that plays on Guam for very long. Let's face it, it won't draw in the crowds here: Nothing explodes, there's no sex, no car chases, and no crude humor.

       This time every year my thoughts turn to   urlLink Kubota Diesel Generators , an excellent diesel generator that runs whisper quiet and supplies ample amounts of electricity to power an entire home. The neighbor up the street installed one after Typhoon Chata'an last year, and he certainly got his money's worth out of it after Typhoon Pongsana. The power was out over two months here on Chalan Ayuyu, and Mr. Taitano's house was brilliantly lit every night. We were all seething with envy during the gasoline shortage immediately after the typhoon too, because diesel supplies were unaffected by the fuel dump fire. While we sweltered in darkness, his Kubota purred along all night powering his air conditioner, refrigerator, lights and television.  Of course the  urlLink thing costs over $13,000 , but it's worth it. Besides,  urlLink Morrico , the local dealer for Kubota, offers excellent service and repair options.  I mention this because I read  urlLink Paul Boutin's   urlLink article  at  urlLink Slate  about the joys of owning a backup generator for power outages. When he quoted $2100 for a 2.5 kW generator, I about choked on my breakfast. That guy got fleeced. Morrico sells  urlLink a rock-solid 6.5 kW gasoline generator for $2150 . And that's ridiculously expensive. After Chata'an, Dianne bought a 5.5 kW  urlLink Porter-Cable   urlLink gasoline generator for $600 , plus shipping. If all you need is to run a few light bulbs or a fan, I'd suggest getting a  urlLink power inverter  for the car, which changes the 12 volt DC power into AC for the household appliances to use. It's good for a temporary solution, which is all most people will ever need.  I'm off to the movies now, perhaps I'll write more about alternative power sources like solar and fuel cells this evening.

       The public toilets at Guam's parks are a disgrace. They are disgusting and vile ruins, heavily vandalized and non-functional. It is one of the top complaints of Japanese tourists when they visit the island. Now the Guam Visitors Bureau, the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Guam Superior Court are teaming up with an innovative  urlLink new plan  - sentencing DUI offenders to clean and maintain the toilets. Not a bad idea, punishment and public service combined. I hope this pans out, unlike earlier attempts to 'adopt-a-toilet' that the previous administration touted as a solution to the public restroom debacle.

       I use my television as an alarm clock, one of the handy things you can do by programming the television.  This morning the tv clicked on and woke me to  urlLink VH-1 , which actually still plays videos in the early morning hours instead of incessant loops of  urlLink  Behind the Music  . As I was laying there, all drowsy and stuff, I gradually became aware of what video was playing. "Who the hell is this?" was my first thought. Some buxom blonde dancing along with a row of dancers, fire hose spraying over her clothes, wetting this woman down. Looked like Britney Spears or something, and it was certainly licentious. But it seemed strangely forced and off-kilter.  Then the camera played over her face and I got a good look at her. WTF?? Is that  urlLink Jewel ? Folky coffee house style singer songwriter Jewel? WTF? No more acoustic guitar, but dance pop and slinky outfits. That's a hell of a  urlLink switcheroo . I can't say I really cared for her music before, but it is disconcerting watching a person attempt to rebrand their image, and market herself as a pop diva.

       Knocked off  urlLink  Diamond Age   last night, those cyber-punk novels always leave me feeling a bit dissappointed. This was no exception. The ideas and action come fast and furious, promising some sea change in the human condition, then they invariably peter out and things go on pretty much the same as before.  Diamond Age  was no different. I still enjoyed it, I just felt it needed a more profound denouement.  Watched the  urlLink  Pride And Prejudice   mini-series on DVD over the weekend. Good stuff. Period costumes, big houses, funny dialogue, Colin Firth brooding in the background. Definitely fare for the  urlLink "Masterpiece Theatre"  crowd.  Speaking of  urlLink PBS , I watched a  urlLink compelling story of Rell Sunn  on Monday night. Surfer, paddler, activist - a truly amazing woman. Her struggle with breast cancer was almost submerged beneath all the other things she did. Even though it claimed her life, she refused to let it ruin her life.

       My internet perambulations inevitably led from alterna-living communities to alternative housing. Here's some that really caught my eye.  For starters, I think it would be cool to live in a geodesic dome house. These companies offer plans and materials to build a dome-home.    urlLink Timberline Geodesics    urlLink Dome Inc.    urlLink Pacific Domes   The problem is all these homes would blow apart like a house of sticks in a typhoon. I know of two geodesic domes on Guam; one is the Citibank building in East Agana, and the other is a private home in Ipan Talofofo. Maybe I should drive down there and ask for a tour of the house.  So maybe domes are not feasible. How about something a little more crunchy granola? How about an  urlLink Earthship , made from recycled tires and beer cans? Not a bad idea, but that all glass exposed side worries me.  Another option is actually fairly common on Guam, converting  urlLink shipping containers  into a homestead. I know several people that have done this and they make nice little homes. They tend to get pretty hot in the tropical sun though, and they need to be securely fastened to a foundation. My friend Boo Boo found her container blew hundred yards from her property after typhoon Pongsona, blocked the road into her family compound and actually crashed into a portion of a neighbor's house. Not cool. Still, containers make for cheap affordable housing for many people.  This site lays out the basics in making a container home for those interested in taking their home with them about the world -  urlLink Global Nomadic Housing For Expatriates .  A good place to find more information on alternate housing designs is the  urlLink Homestead.org  web site. Check it out and see if anything catches your eye!

       A couple years ago, my plumeria were in a sorry state. The plants were infested with an insect that dessicated the leaves and left a crusty white residue on leaves and branches. I came to find out it was an invasive  urlLink papaya mealybug  which also has a taste for plumeria and other ornamentals. I feared I would forever lose the beautiful flowers and frangrance of the plumeria.  But help arrived in the form of a small wasp imported from Puerto Rico.  urlLink Biologists at the University of Guam released the microscopic parasites last year , and the initial results are positive. The wasp lays an egg inside the mealybug, which matures into a larva and devours the unfortunate host from the inside out. A rather gruesome way to go, but this little wasp is nature's predator for the mealybug.  My plumeria are saved from the ravages of the papaya mealybug thanks to this unseen wasp. Of course all three plumeria in the yard took a tremendous beating from the typhoons last year and only now show signs of blooming. But I am looking forward to that day.

       I watched  urlLink  An Evening With Kevin Smith   last night. A documentary compiling Q&A sessions at five universities, the movie is a tad long at 3� hours, but several stories are really hilarious. Highlights included a long tale about his experience with Warner Brothers and re-writing a Superman script, and an equally bizarre tale about a week he spent in Minneapolis filming a documentary for Prince.  As for the other movies I watched over the weekend,  urlLink  Fitzcarraldo   was great and  urlLink  Following   was okay. The scene in  Fitzcarraldo  where Klaus Kinksi plays Caruso into the tumultuous jungle, alone on the deck of his steamship and facing the vague hostility of native drums is priceless. As Caruso warbles into the jungle, thetattooo of the drums changes, falls into step with the music, then stops, as if the Amazon itself is entranced by opera. A slow sedate film, chock full of amazing visuals.   Following  was pretty good, a coarse little thriller that tossed in a couple good twists, and  urlLink Christopher Nolan's  signature convoluted timelines. It played with the storyline during a brief 70 minutes, leaving me guessing a couple times. Not bad - gritty and violent, but not bad.

       I was afraid of this. The location of the big tire fire Saturday night was  urlLink BKA-Ko'ku Recycling , the place  urlLink I mentioned last month . They recently introduced tire recycling to Guam. The company just purchased a  urlLink $100,000 tire baler  to make dense compacted cubes from old tires. The cubes are suitable for a number of construction purposes. It is a great idea and a practical solution to a pressing problem on Guam. Too bad; now they are a smoking cinder in the ground.  I will be interested to hear what the fire department's inquiry discovers. I imagine it was the usual destructive combo; too much beer after work, a lit cigarette, some oily rags, ka-BOOM. Another good idea goes up in smoke.

       A huge fire erupted last night (Saturday) in Barrigada when  urlLink a tire dump ignited  next to the PriceSmart warehouse shopping club. It's expected to burn for several days.  Lovely. Remind me not to go anywhere near that area for a week. It's gonna stick up there for a long time. Not to mention all the people in Barrigada Heights that are breathing the fumes, that can't be good for anybody's health.

       I watched  urlLink  Punch Drunk Love   last night. I was expecting  urlLink  Magnolia  , it certainly wasn't up to my expectations.  urlLink  Boogie Nights   was a better movie, and I didn't really like  Boogie Nights . At least  Boogie Nights  had lots of sex to keep me interested. Adam Sandler doing his usual hapless moron routine is not worth the rental price. If I need to watch Adam Sandler, I'll pop in that one where he plays golf, at least that has some laughs.  Punch Drunk Love  was cheerless and forced. Stay away. Stay away.

       Finally! I got an entire weekend to just chill out and do nothing. No work, no commitments, no parties to go to, no dinners to attend. I can just sit around and vegetate all weekend. Cool.   Took the  urlLink  Blue Torpedo   for a bit of a spin this evening after work. Nothing like taking the scenic route home on Cross-Island Road. Nice sunset, windy road, cool tunes, new car. Not a bad way to start the weekend.

       Scientists are studying the reef ecosystem at  urlLink Anatahan . The island was the site of a massive volcanic eruption earlier this year, and the ash cloud destroyed a vibrant, thriving coral reef.  Scientists from  urlLink NOAA  recently surveyed the damage to the reef. They are fascinated by the opportunity to study the rebirth of a  urlLink coral reef . The coral supported a thriving community before the May 2003 eruption, and scientists can now observe the change from desolate wasteland to thriving community over the course of decades.

       Well, it had to happen sooner or later; my fantasy football squad stumbled this week and lost for the first time. I am now 3-1 on the season. It was a tough week for my roster, while my opponent's players finally got their act together and posted some points.  Randy Moss played terrible the first three weeks of the season, and since both he and Culpepper were listed as doubtful, I benched him for Laveranues Coles, arguably the best receiver in football this year. What happens? Moss goes off and scores three touchdowns and racks up hundred of yards receiving, while Coles has a lackluster day with no TD's. Damn. That's why I hate Randy Moss/Terrell Owens type of players. They are too damn sporadic. They only show up to play every three or four games. I still think we got the best receiver corps in our league with Randy Moss, Coles, Santana Moss, and Dangling Chad Johnson. I only wish all players were like the Chad. That dude is like money in the bank man. Solid points every week, guaranteed.  More troubling are my travails at running back. Portis is proving to be too frail to last an entire game, and Corey Dillon is a wuss that won't stay in an entire game. Our backups aren't much help either, the anemic Anthony Thomas and LaBrandon Toefield, a rookie riding the pine until Fred Taylor gets injured over in Jacksonville. Not much. I attribute this week's loss to our decision to start Portis even though he was doubtful against the Lions. Our reasoning, even a single quarter of play from Portis is worth more than an entire game of Anthony Thomas in the backfield. Little did we know that Dillon would take himself out of the game -  again . Ugh. Our two starting running backs produced two fantasy points. I am not pleased.  The other positions were solid this week. Doug Jolley snagged a touchdown, and Jeff Wilkins booted three field goals. Our second string defense, the Jaguars, contributed some points during Tampa's bye week. That's all we needed 'em to do. And while Maddox is struggling to hit his receivers for touchdowns, Matt Hasselbeck is back in action next week against the Packers. I'm hoping for a shoot out.  The supplemental draft is coming in a couple weeks, and I am already scheming on how to bolster the running game. It is certainly the most vexing part of our lineup. Too bad the pickings are pretty slim, we might have to engineer a trade if things don't pan out.

       The Department of Parks and Recreation announced the  urlLink closure of four major facilities  today. The departments budget was cut in half and DPR director Joe Duenas says he has no choice but to close the Guam Sports Complex in Dededo, the Hag�t�a Swimming Pool, the Hag�t�a Tennis Courts and Paseo Stadium. He also announced that 50 of the department's 83 employees will lose their jobs.  Sounds like Parks and Rec is about to become just Parks. It sucks, but this is probably just the beginning. GovGuam needs to cut back on services and become a leaner organization. It just sucks that the things getting cut are the good things a government should provide; parks, a swimming pool, tennis courts. They are not critical services, but they make the community a better place. I woouldn't be surprised if the Public Library is next on the chopping block, followed by the Guam Museum.  Slowly the quality of life dwindles on Guam.

       The week at work was an interesting one. The arbitration with GovGuam happens this week, so most of my time was spent gathering data to support our position. It was a pretty busy week.  The axe dropped on Friday. A round of layoffs struck our office and there was lots of crying amongst the survivors. Of course we couldn't see the unfortunate, they were dismissed immediately, and not allowed to mingle with the employees. Their cubicles sat empty all day, a silent reminder of the recently departed. Their personal effects still littered the cubes. They could return on Saturday to collect their things, under the watchful eye of a human resources representative and a security guard. Seperate the living from the dead, the wheat from the chaff.

       Time for a quick scan of some recent headlines.    urlLink Marilyn Manibusan off to prison  - Former senator and Guam Territorial Land Use Commissioner Marilyn Manibusan  urlLink departed island  this week to begin her sentence in federal prison. She was sentenced to five years and 11 months for extortion, money laundering, wire fraud, and bankruptcy fraud during her tenure at the Guam Territorial Land Use Commission.   urlLink Gerry Yingling indicted  - former Guam International Airport administrator Gerry Yingling was  urlLink indicted this week ,  urlLink after  a  urlLink string  of  urlLink stories  detailing further abuse and misuse of travel by airport officials and others in the previous administration. Authorities were  urlLink still searching  for Yingling yesterday, and suspected he might be  urlLink in the Philippines .   urlLink Former Parks and Recreation official indicted  - Rounding out the trifecta of former government officials indicted or imprisoned this week, Franklin Herrero was  urlLink indicted this week  on charges that he took funds from the Department of Parks and Recreation and deposited them into the employee's association bank account.  Power rates  urlLink to go up , water rates  urlLink to go up , test scores  urlLink to fall  -  May you live in interesting times.   urlLink FY 2004 budget railroaded through  - legislators shot the new budget through to the governor last week, and basically extorted him to sign the budget by tying it to an airport bond refinancing measure that would expire that very day.   urlLink Banned coach discovered at football practice  - Loring Cruz, banned for life from coaching high school football because of a player's death a decade ago, was found at practice sessions for the George Washington Geckos this week. The incident sparked a  urlLink firestorm  of controversy in the local media, especially after he was  urlLink caught on videotape . It sure looked like coaching to me.   urlLink Guam man arrested in Chicago for luring underage girl over internet  - A Guam man was arrested in Chicago last week for planning a sexual rendezvous with an underage girl he met over the internet.  -And that was the week that was.

       A surprisingly lucid letter to the editor appeared in yesterday's PDN.  urlLink GovGuam has far too many officials.  Boy, you can say that again. Mr. Stoianoff makes a good point about the bloated size of GovGuam, but some of the increased size is necessary. Guam is not a city, it is a self governing territory in a compact, semi-urban environment. Thus GovGuam needs to address the needs of both a city government and a state government, plus police its borders, manage a deep water port, and operate independent utility agencies. It's a tall order, and it needs a larger government than what is required to run a city.  All that aside, I do agree with Mr. Stoianoff about the bloat. Vice Mayors? C'mon. 15 Senators? Really... Here's a compromise, reduce the senators to 11, and have them represent actual districts instead of being senators at large. Reduce the mayors to 11 as well, and have them handle the day to day affairs in these districts. The two elected officials, senator and mayor, can work in tandem for the betterment of their district. They can even share one enlarged office staff between them.

        urlLink Largest Arctic Ice Shelf Crumbles  off Ellesmere Island.  The Ward Hunt Ice Shelf broke up with Canada after 3,000 years. Sources cite irreconcilable differences between the massive ice sheet and the North American continent. While not blaming the split up on global warming, scientists did cautiously mention North America's 150 year temperature upswing, which happens to coincide with the continent's flirtation with industrialization.  Diving right back into the polar dating scene, remnants of the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf were recently seen with Greenland. A spokesman for the Ice Shelf would neither confirm nor deny these sightings.

       One more post about Tibet and then I will shut up.  urlLink I mentioned last week  the increasing popularity of Tibetan Buddhism in the West, due in large part to the Dalai Lama. He recently drew over 65,000 to Central Park. At the same time, the Chinese government is stepping up efforts to assimilate Tibet into the rest of China.  One key component of that assimilation is tourism:  urlLink Tibet tourism drive disrupts Buddhist temple life , underscores Chinese control. The influx of tourists has brought the hassle of modern life, and the chase for much-needed cash, into Tibet's ancient society. Even the monks can no longer spend hours contemplating, they must play host to swarms of visitors. While I think the opening of Tibet will inflect even more harm on this captive nation, I cannot deny their right to development and the 21 st  century. It would be ridiculous to cloister them away from the rest of the world, and downright ignorant to expect them to turn their back on modern necessities like running water and power. If tourism and the concomitant loss of culture is the price to pay for modernization, so be it. And I must admit I would like to visit Tibet someday too. Here's the Chinese governments  urlLink Tibetan tourism page , full of interesting visit Tibet information. Let's pray that what makes Tibet unique is strong enough to survive the onslaught of tourism.  A good link for Tibet resources is  urlLink Tibet Information Network , an independent clearinghouse for Tibetan news and information.  Now if you will excuse, I am heading off to watch a bit of  urlLink Robert Thurman's  excellent  urlLink Tibet documentary  before I fall asleep.  Esta Gupa!

       The Pacific Daily News put up a  urlLink redesigned web site  today. The changes are all positive, enhancing the readability of the site and offering a more cohesive design.  However, the site still lacks even the most basic search functionality. It makes navigation infinitely harder on the site, especially when trying to look up something from a week or a month ago. The information is in there, but perseverance is necessary. A determined visitor needs to manually type in specific URL's for different archived days. Even the mighty Google is powerless to locate these archived pages since they exist in a vacuum, entirely self-contained. Nothing links to the archive pages so Google's bots never know of the archive's existence. This is a problem that sorely needs attention by the Pacific Daily News.

       I watched  urlLink Koyaanisqatsi  several times over the last couple weeks. First time in a very long time - over ten years. It still moves me.  The photography is amazing, and the Philip Glass score dazzles  me.  I also watched  urlLink Powaqqatsi  last week. While I like that sequel, it is not as powerful a vision as Koyaanisqatsi. Koyaanisqatsi dazzles with images of technology, our shining beast. Powaqqatsi lectures on the sins on modernization, visited upon the third world. The images are still spectacular, but the viewer is browbeaten by the singular message. With Koyaanisqatsi, an ambiguity exists -  is this glittering pinnacle of technology a good or bad thing?  Powaqqatsi solidly affirms that the modern world is a bad thing, and that salvation lies in the traditional world. That view is too one dimensional, and it lacks the impact. The first film offers a new perspective on reality, allowing the viewer to draw her own conclusions. The second dictates what the viewer must feel.  I mention this because I will shortly be picking up the third film in the series,  urlLink Naqoyqatsi , which I have never seen before. This is  urlLink Godfrey Reggio's  first film since the internet revolution and 9/11, it was released late last year. I am curious what grim images it will unleash. I suspect it is not going to be a pleasant film.  Koyaanisqatsi  is Hopi for 'Life out of Balance,'  Powaqqatsi  translates as 'Life in Transformation,' but  Naqoyqatsi  means 'Life as War.' An ill portent.

       So here it is, week 3 of the fantasy football season and  urlLink my team  is on the verge of being 3-0. Not too shabby. It is still early in the season though, and a number of mishaps have occurred. My backup kicker got released last week and now I don't have a kicker for next week's game since my primary kicker has a bye. Lucky we'll be playing one of the worst teams in the league, so it shouldn't be too great a loss. A couple players aren't working out the way I hoped, Corey Dillon in particular. He might be trade fodder for a mid-season deal. And Randy Moss must be smokin' too many doobies because his performance lately has been sub-par. Overall the team is a good mix of solid players, capable of putting up 90-100 fantasy points each week. I think this will be a pretty good season.

       A Japanese mountaineer announced the results of 12 year's research into the existence of the abominable snowman or yeti. He concluded that the yeti is  urlLink just a regional variation of the word for bear   Makoto Nebuka, 56, a senior member of the Japanese Alpine Club, plans to publish the results of his 12 years of research which led him to conclude the mysterious creature, known as the "Yeti," is really the endangered Himalayan Brown Bear (Ursus Arctos). ... Nebuka's theory rests on a linguistic discovery: Through a series of interviews with local people in Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan, he has found that "yeti" is a regional dialect word for "meti", meaning bear. Ethnic Tibetan tribes who are scared of the powerful bears which often attack their villages, worship the meti/yeti as a dreadful, supernatural creature, Nebuka said.   Sounds a great deal more plausible than some unseen giant snow ape running around in the mountains.

        urlLink Gary  is heading out on a three day float trip on  urlLink the beautiful Big Piney River of the Missouri Ozarks  in a few days. I am jealous. That's one thing I miss living out here on Guam. When I took my 'sabbatical' in 2000, I joined Gary and his friend Don on their yearly float trip and it was great. It was a good warm up for my  urlLink camping expeditions into Canada  and the Cascades later that summer.

       More from Wired:  urlLink How Ravenous Soviet Viruses Will Save the World . I actually saw something on PBS a couple years ago on this very topic. The show introduced viewers to the  urlLink Eliava Institute  in Georgia and the research Soviet scientists conducted on phages during the Cold War. Now a new startup called  urlLink Intralytix  is partnering with the Georgian scientists to bring phages research to the world. It holds great promise in this age of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

       Gary, my oldest brother, is something of a libertarian and he frequently forwards links about economic policy. The latest was  urlLink a speech  by Representative Ron Paul (R-Texas) on paper money and the fixing the dollar to the gold standard again. Interesting stuff.  Then I stumbled across a  urlLink complementary story  on another website Gary mentioned, the  urlLink the Ludwig von Mises Institute , and it made me go 'hmmm.' Maybe he is onto something here.  In fact, Gary was talking about how the war on Iraq was actually a scheme to stabilize waning US economic dominance by forcing Iraq to sell oil for dollars instead of Euros. Looks like he was  urlLink right about that too . Gotta keep the dollar pegged up high against all threats, especially the resurgent Euro, and the best way to do that is through the use of uncontested military might to overthrow countries that threaten the hegemony of the almighty dollar.

       Found a  urlLink fascinating article  originally published in Rolling Stone back in 1972 about  urlLink Spacewar  and academic computing in general, written by  urlLink Stewart Brand , of  urlLink Whole Earth Catalog ,  urlLink the WELL , and more recently  urlLink the Long Now Foundation .  What struck me in the article was the foresight Brand possessed about where computers and networks were heading. Take this sentence for example:  "Since huge quantities of information can be computer-digitalized and transmitted, music researchers could, for example, swap records over the Net with "essentially perfect fidelity." So much for record stores (in present form)."  He wrote that in 1972. No wonder he is fascinated by building a 10,000 year clock; the guy can sense the shape of things to come.  Thanks to  urlLink McGee's Musings  for the link.

       Rounding out my space Thursday here on Guam, I got one more post. Many months ago I ordered a  urlLink Meade ETX 125EC  telescope online. Kudos to Craig Cleland for handling the trans-shipment of the telescope, a dicey affair that took far longer than I expected; backordered equipment, snafu delivery attempts, and finally a slow boat to Guam via parcel post. Craig handled it all with aplomb, so my heartfelt thanks Craig.  Too bad it was raining like mad this evening, all set up and nothing to see. Maybe this weekend will be better. I am excited, the night sky is excellent here on Guam and a telescope is a good choice for the serious stargazer. This ETX 125 is large enough to resolve interesting object, but still highly portable and affordable. Plus it came with a automatic star finder and sturdy tripod for stable positioning. I can't wait to try this thing out.

       Continuing with today's space theme, I got to mention Burt Rutan and  urlLink Scaled Composite's  privately funded  urlLink drive to achieve sub-orbital space flight . Spaceship 1 is the odds on favorite to win the  urlLink X Prize , a $10 million award for the first private venture to reach 100 kilometers in a spacecraft with three people, return safely to earth and repeat the launch within two weeks.  While several X Prize teams are working on smaller versions of traditional rocket launchers, Scaled Composites plan harkens back the to  urlLink NASA's X-15  experimental rocket plane flights of  urlLink the early sixties . Like the X-15, Spaceship 1 is ferried aloft by a larger conventional jet airplane. Upon reaching approximately 60,000 feet, it detaches and fires a rocket motor for over a minute to propel the spacecraft to 2,500 miles per hour and a maximum altitude of 60 miles. When the propellant is used up, Spaceship 1 becomes a glider and floats down to a runway landing about an hour later.  Unlike most of the X Prize teams, Scaled Composites actually has all the components constructed and in the testing stage. Last month the mother ship White Knight took Spaceship 1 to 47,000 feet and released her for a  urlLink controlled glide  back to the desert runway. And just last week the rocket motor was  urlLink successfully fired . Next step, mounting the rocket motor to the spaceship and running more in-flight tests.  While Scaled Composites has set no firm launch date, rumors about that they plan their launch to commemorate the 100 th  anniversary of the  urlLink Wright brother's  Kitty Hawk flight. That happens on December 3 rd , only a few months away. A new era in space flight may be upon us.

       Interesting story on the continuing development of a  urlLink space elevator ; interest in the concept is growing, especially considering NASA's continued urlLink troubles with a launch vehicle . NASA is actually considering reverting to an Apollo style capsule to launch astronauts into orbit. Sources state that the costs to develop a new space capsule are drastically cheaper than designs for a re-usable space plane. Here's a newsflash - the Russians already have one, it's called  urlLink Soyuz , and they use it all the time. Hell, there's one docked to the space station  urlLink right now . Let's just subcontract with them to toss astronauts into space. I am certain they'd love the exposure, not to mention the infusion of cash. It would certainly function as a serviceable stop gap measure until a space elevator can be constructed. Realistic estimates on a space elevator put it about 15 years in the future. Once constructed, the cost to reach Earth orbit drops from $10,000 a pound to $100 a pound.

       Well, lookie here:  "In the two years since law enforcement agencies gained fresh powers to help them track down and punish terrorists, police and prosecutors have increasingly turned the force of the new laws not on al-Qaida cells but on people charged with common crimes."   urlLink New Terror Laws Used Vs. Common Criminals . Looks like that right wing abomination John Ashcroft is quite happy to apply those emergency powers to combat terrorism on  urlLink common criminals .   "Within six months of passing the Patriot Act, the Justice Department was conducting seminars on how to stretch the new wiretapping provisions to extend them beyond terror cases," said Dan Dodson, a spokesman for the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys. "They say they want the Patriot Act to fight terrorism, then, within six months, they are teaching their people how to use it on ordinary citizens." [...]  Stefan Cassella, deputy chief for legal policy for the Justice Department's asset forfeiture and money laundering section, said that while the Patriot Act's primary focus was on terrorism, lawmakers were aware it contained provisions that had been on prosecutors' wish lists for years and would be used in a wide variety of cases.   This bodes ill for civil liberties. The powers that were expanded by the Patriot Act were restricted precisely because the Justice department and FBI abused them in the past; wiretaps on civil rights leaders, surveillance of peace activists, J. Edgar Hoover's extensive files on artists, actors and prominent liberals, all culminating in the Republican party spying on the Democratic party headquarters in Watergate. The tendency is for authorities to overstep their bounds and abuse their power. The vast powers authorized by the Patriot Act are a dagger aimed at the heart of democracy.

       This weekend marked a spate of downloads. I already mentioned that spiffy Mozilla Firebird - good stuff. I just pulled down  urlLink Tinderbox 2.0 ,  urlLink Fetch 4.03 , and  urlLink Eudora 6.0 . How exciting, new ftp software and an email client. Fetch looks promising, an old friend that I wanted to get reacquainted with. And while my progress with Tinderbox has been woefully slow, I intend to really tackle it sometime soon - as soon as the GovGuam brouhaha settles down. And I actually ponied up the cash for Eudora 6.0 in paid mode. Say goodbye to spam, Eudora now has a built in  urlLink Bayesian spam filter .     Excellent...  (In my best  urlLink C.

       The hometown alternative weekly, the Riverfront Times, ran an article on St. Louis' decrepit  urlLink "Amshack"  train station, a dilapidated and pitiful structure. I have to agree. The train station in St. Louis, a regional metropolitan center, is pathetic. It is nothing more than a run down trailer home, lost underneath the Highway 40 overpass. It is an embarrassment for the city, especially since even small country towns possess better facilities. Whenever I take the train to Chicago, I try to avoid the station and get on at Kirkwood, but that tacks another two hours onto the trip since trains stop at St. Louis for a couple hours anyway.  Hopefully the city can summon the wherewithal to construct a train station befitting St. Louis and her place in railroad history.

       Well I can finally sleep at night. There is no  urlLink magic knight's tour  on a standard 8x8 chessboard.  For those possibly interested, a knight's tour is when a knight travels to all 64 squares on a chessboard, touching each square only once.   urlLink     A  urlLink magic square  is when the sum of numbers arranged in a grid is the same for every row, column and diagonal. This number is known as a  urlLink magic constant .   urlLink     Thus a  urlLink magic knight's tour  is when the path a laid down in a knight's tour describes a magic box.  urlLink Mathematicians have long known  of a number of semi-magic knight's tours, where the diagonal did not meet the magic constant. Last month, software written by  urlLink J. C. Meyrignac  proved that  urlLink a magic knight's tour was impossible . It took a 2 GHz Pentium 4 computer over 61 days to process the problem.

       The Department of Education announced  urlLink the results  of last year's SAT-9 battery of tests. Over 15,000 students took the tests, which measure ability in reading, mathematics, science and language skills.  The results were the worse ever. All grades tested show an average drop of 7 percentile points. Most of the scores were in the upper teens, and some in the 20 th  percentile. That means they scored better than 20% of children nationwide that took the test. I looked up the schools I went to when I was a kid; they score in the 90 th  percentile and above. One graph indicate that 89% of this year's seniors have little to knowledge of math, reading or science, and  urlLink that 0% were prepared for college level courses .  That qualifies as a craptacular failure of the public school system. Good thing government administrators  urlLink aren't too worried about the results .  A variety of  urlLink excuses  were offered for the horrendous scores, from inadequate supplies to substandard classrooms. We should all be ashamed, especially the elected officials. They pay lip service to the importance of education, but do nothing to address the deteriorating school system. We are failing to educate students in the fundamentals, the basic requirements for life in a democratic society. I am appalled at the results. Simply appalled.

       So I'm driving home from work about an hour ago, listening to  urlLink Echoes  on  urlLink KPRG . Announcer John Diliberto plugs an upcoming concert and plays a snippet of music. First thing going through my head -  'That's Phillip Glass.'  Second thing going through my head -  'That's  urlLink Phillip Glass ' soundtrack to  urlLink Koyaanisqatsi .'  Third thing running through my head -  'I got no business recognizing Phillip Glass compositions from obscure art house movies. I am a redneck from Missouri living on a tropical island.'   Sadly I do listen to public radio. I do enjoy Echoes and the ambient music. I like jazz, I like classical. I enjoy Fresh Air with Terry Gross. I own Koyaanisqatsi on DVD, along with the two sequels. I own several CD's of Phillip Glass and many more obscure composers. I get my jollies star-gazing with a telescope, reading Russian literature, or poring over maps with a fine tooth comb. If I watch television, it's either the Simpsons, Futurama, Star Trek or the Discovery Channel. I spend my days spinning a web of numbers in Excel and maintaining databases with reams of inscrutable data. I can program in at least four computer languages. Lately I've been drinking lots of Mountain Dew, and I enjoy it. Sweet Jesus, Mary and Joseph, I'm a geek.

       Alabama's been hitting the headlines lately, making it apparent that Alabamans are reasserting their claim to being the most bass-ackward state in the union.    The Ten Commandments boondoggle  - I abstained from mentioning  urlLink this debacle  with the  urlLink Ten Commandments  in the Alabama Supreme Courthouse but I think the time is right for me to chime in.  urlLink Judge Roy Moore's  quest to introduce religion into the state's judicial system is not a recent development. He tried this in  urlLink 1995 ,  urlLink 2000 , 2001 and finally sneaked the granite monolith into the courthouse earlier this year under the cover of darkness. He loudly proclaims that the commandments are the basis of law in the United States, a statement that his patently false. Our legal system is a direct descendant of English common law, which dates back to the pagan Anglo-Saxons. Don't believe me? Ask  urlLink Thomas Jefferson , he might know a thing or two about it. A direct quote from a founding father:   "I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary, which you have adduced, is incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed."   Straight from the horses' mouth. Of course this  urlLink won't quiet a demagogue  like Judge Roy Moore,  urlLink his agenda  is the blind adoption of religion into the government of the United States. This is the very thing the progenitors of our country disavowed. It might seem like ancient history, but the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were rife with sectarian violence, Protestant against Catholic, Protestant against Protestant. The agonies of those centuries endures today in Kosovo and Northern Ireland. Our nation's founders sought an end to such strife, and they correctly recognized that the source of conflict lay in the political endorsement of one religion at the expense of another. By installing the  urlLink Ten Commandments , Judge Roy Moore selects one religion above others. Why not adhere to fundamentalist Islam,  urlLink like the Taliban ? Or endorse Hinduism or the teachings of the Buddha? It's a slippery slope this religious fundamentalism, and it leads back down to the Protestant Reformation and the 30 Year's War, the Hundred Year's War, the English Civil War, the Inquisition and a number of other things I would hope we put behind us. Our forefathers were determined not to repeat history's mistakes, they boldly set our nation apart as a nation created by and for all people, regardless of race or creed.   Apostate Republicans and a revamped tax code  - Seems there might be a change fomenting among Alabama conservatives.  urlLink Bob Riley , the Republican governor of Alabama turned his back on his party and political power base and introduced a new tax code for Alabama, one that raises taxes on the wealthy and propertied landowners while reducing the crippling tax burden on the poor. He cites an  urlLink Alabama law professor and her biblical thesis  as the reason for his turncoat behavior. Seems some conservatives are discovering that  urlLink being a good Christian means helping the poor , not the rich. What a concept. This betrayal of the Republican party is being met with anger and discord among the state's conservative power base.  urlLink Voters will decide  the tax issue on  urlLink September 9 th  .  Update:  The tax revision was  urlLink defeated  at the polls today. Observers cite a successful disinformation campaign by the Republican party and conservative factions in the state against the governor.

       Two interesting projects out on the internet that approach different subjects with a similar methodology.    urlLink Mindworld  - Visitors are asked to answer a question regarding the disposition of a random pixel in a graphic. Is it land or water? A vague Mercator projection of the world is developing through this interaction.   urlLink Typophile  - Same idea, but visitors are tasked with designing a font, picking pixels to determine the shape of any given letter.  It's a cool idea. The best thing to do on both sights is watch the development of the shapes from a random collection of pixels towards a coherent shape. The letters are particularly intriguing to watch. It becomes a study in group think. Several times a letter approaches something near perfection, then drift sets in. Slowly the lower case "n" resolves out of random noise, nears completion, then grows larger and larger, slowly changing from a serif to sans serif letter. Then it hits you: the letter isn't supposed to achieve perfection. The process is the whole point of the exercise. Watching how an idea grows and develops and changes over time, that's the function of the project.

       The weather has been crazy lately. Lots of thunderstorms looming over the island. A Japanese tourist was  urlLink struck and killed  last week. But I guess thunderstorms are expected at this time of year. Tony Sanchez, director of the Superior Court, wrote a  urlLink good editorial  last week that mentioned the  urlLink ancient Chamoru calendar  and the names they used for August and September.  August was the eighth moon cycle of the year, called "Tenhos," which means "angry or out of patience." Given the increase in temperature and the reaction to hot humid August summer nights, impatience and anger were descriptive.   The month of September, or the ninth moon cycle, was called "lamlam" or "lumamlam," meaning "lightning." Recent lightning storms underscore the appropriateness of this name.      I found this  urlLink excellent page  on the Pacific World website that included this graphic, which was taken from Lawrence Cunningham's  urlLink "Ancient Chamorro Society."  This calendar was probably used for agricultural purposes, and tied to the cycles of the moon like the Chinese or  urlLink Japanese Calendars .  Recent discoveries have led to the discovery of  urlLink another Chamoru calendar , probably used for different purposes. The months were not based on the  urlLink waxing and waning of the moon  like  urlLink many calendars , but on the rising of  urlLink different constellations , and the calendar was probably used in navigation. A similar calendar is still taught in  urlLink Puluwat  and other  urlLink outlying Micronesian islands . While not the  urlLink oldest identified calendar , this calendar is very old.

       Scientists at Johns Hopkins sheepishly admitted that a widely cited study they released last year about the dangers of ecstasy were  urlLink completely in error . Turns out the scientists were injecting baboons with speed, not ecstasy. The retraction is in the September issue of  urlLink Science , the journal that published the results exactly one year ago.  This wouldn't be such a big deal if this study wasn't cited as one of the reasons for the passage of the RAVE act earlier this year. You don't remember the RAVE act? Probably not, since it was tacked onto the "Amber Alert" law during the eleventh hour of that bill's passage through Congress. RAVE stands for "Reducing Americans Vulnerability to ecstasy." Of course ecstasy wasn't even on the agenda when federal DEA agents squelched a NORML rally in Billings Montana by threatening the venue's owner with a $250,000 fine and forfeiture if he allowed the meeting to occur.  This is just the sort of thuggish behavior that was cited when the RAVE act was initially killed in committee last year - that federal authorities would use the threat of action against venues to stifle free speech instead of going after rave venues and promoters. That didn't stop Senator Joe Biden, the author of the bill, from sneaking it in under the aegis of the "Amber Alert" bill.  So now that this report is exposed as patently false, will the law be repealed? Yeah... right. Try telling that to John Ashcroft and see if he keeps a straight face.  A good source for information on the RAVE act and the abortive "Wars On Drugs" can be found at  urlLink AlterNet: DrugReporter . An especially good article is  urlLink The Right To Party  by Neal Pollack of the  urlLink Brooklyn Rail .

        urlLink The Zulus  looked pretty solid in their first outing this week, knocking off Team Ashebrand. The score is currently Zulus 87 - Ashebrand 69; and our Tampa Bay defense has yet to play. I think this a good start.  There were some gaffes - Starting Matt Hasselbeck (13 points) instead of Tommy Maddox (22 points) proved an error, and we definitely picked the kicker (Jeff Wilkins, 7 points - Jeff Chandler, 19 points). Live and learn. Things will become clearer as the season progresses.

       KUAM's got a story about the  urlLink "GovGuam Healthcare Debacle"  while Newstalk K-57 has an interesting  urlLink message board devoted to the topic .   While I'm at it, today's Pacific Sunday News has an  urlLink extensive opinion page  devoted to the legislature's upcoming decision to authorize a $14.88 unfunded gift to GovGuam retirees. The PDN pulls no punches, basically labeling the annuity a political bribe to the significant number of GovGuam retirees.  But it's easy to call supplemental annuities moral obligations to retirees instead of admitting that they are political payments. These annual gifts make senators look good and most assuredly help in their re-election bids.  Several senators and former legislators also contributed opinions on this issue. They are amazingly consistent in their support of the supplemental annuity, despite the fact that the hospital is dilapidated, the Ordot Dump is a festering sore, and the schools lack basic supplies and books. It's democracy in action.

Over 20 close relatives of Bin Laden were shuttled out of the country and into Europe before the FBI could question them. All at the behest of the Saudi government, and authorized by George W. Bush.

Dianne has a collection of paperbacks she inherited from Seabee Bob Evans last month. His battalion returned Stateside and they donated all these books to Dianne. She is going to bring them to Chu'uk, but she offered me first pick if anything caught my eye. Browsing through the collection one book caught my eye.  urlLink Hamlet II, Ophelia's Revenge . The tagline for this  urlLink craptacular  piece of fiction? "Something is  rotting  in the state of Denmark." I am not kidding.

       Check out the new fuel cell technology from  urlLink Millennium Cell . One of the tricky problems with fuel cells is the storage of large quantities of elemental hydrogen, not exactly a stable thing to keep in large quantities (think  urlLink Hindenburg ).  urlLink This new technology  from Millennium Cell utilizes sodium borohydride NaBH 4  to store hydrogen. Sodium borohydride is a safe, non-flammable liquid. When combined with water in the presence of a catalyst, the resulting reaction liberates the hydrogen and leaves sodium metaborate and a small amount of heat:  NaBH 4  + 2 H 2 O  NaBO 2  + 4 H 2  Very cool. Hopefully this technology will lead to more developments in fuel cell production.

       The New Yorker has an  urlLink excellent article  about the impending death of the  urlLink Galileo space probe . On September 21 st , the aging probe will plunge into Jupiter's violent atmosphere and incinerate. This drastic step is being taken to avoid contamination of Europa, Jupiter's liquid moon. Scientists are not willing to risk having an underpowered probe rattling about around Jupiter, possibly harboring some especially hardy Terran microbes that could reach the surface of the icy moon. So Galileo is committing suicide before the last of its propellant is used up and it becomes a derelict.  The tale of Galileo's voyage to the Jovian system is an incredible adventure. Long delayed due to the 1986 Challenger disaster, it took a long and winding route to reach Jupiter. Along the way the high gain antenna, the link to earth, refused to unfold, threatening to ruin the mission. Instead, engineers managed to rewrite the probe's software to send highly compressed data along a small, slow backup antenna.  The Galileo mission is an excellent example of what  urlLink NASA  should be doing in space, sending out robotic probes to the far reaches of the solar system. Instead the agency fritters time and money into tossing a few astronauts into orbit, a costly fixation that provides little real scientific data. To spend so much time playing around in near earth orbit, measuring long term zero gravity effects on the human body or observing bees making honeycombs, while the untapped mysteries of the solar system beckon is amazingly shortsighted.   The outer planets beckon! Send an armada of probes to Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto. Stop putting astronauts in space, with such  urlLink awful and dangerous consequences .

       Oh yeah,  urlLink  Kill Bill  .  I went to see  urlLink  Kill Bill   last week and promised a review. It was okay, full of cartoonish violence and fake blood.

       I got to thinking about the new ID badges they passed out at work a while ago. We now have to pass the badge over a scanner to gain access to different areas and departments at work. How do those things work? Obviously some kind of radio frequency was being used, but the badges contain no batteries. They must be transponders of some kind. What's going on here?  Well this led to a little research on the internet. The badges use a device called  urlLink Radio Frequency ID , or  urlLink RFID . Get used to that term, they are  urlLink about to burst into the mainstream . These tiny little radio transponders could bring about some  urlLink big changes in society . Unlike bar codes which must be manually scanned, RFID tags are automatically read when they come in proximity to a reader. Since passive RFID tags require no batteries or moving parts, they offer long term durability and shelf life. New RFID tags are so small they can be embedded in just about anything,  urlLink bank notes ,  urlLink clothes ,  urlLink pets , and even  urlLink students . Okay, maybe they're not implanted in students yet, but the principal in that Wired article sounds like he would be amenable to such a development. He touts the ability of the system to track students location in and out of school, to constantly monitor students for their own safety. Uh, kinda like Big Brother?  RFID is poised to become ubiquitous due to a big push by Wal-Mart to replace bar codes with RFID tagged items in stores. And when Wal-Mart talks, suppliers listen. The fear of civil libertarians is that RFID tags will be used to intrude on personal privacy. Think of last year's movie,  urlLink  Minority Report  . Whenever Tom Cruise walked around in public, retinal scanners instantly ID'ed him. People fear something just like that, but instead of using eyes to ID somebody, a halo of almost microscopic RFID tags would signal a person's presence and their every move.

       Last week marked  urlLink KPRG's  fall pledge drive. I cannot stress enough how valuable KPRG is to Guam. The sole public radio, community radio station on island, KPRG offers a diverse mix of  urlLink NPR ,  urlLink PRI , and  urlLink local programming . This is an unusual situation. Other public radio stations are usually entirely NPR or entirely PRI programming, never a mix of the two. And community radio is usually something completely different. Only here on Guam is there a blend of all three. A highly eclectic blend.   This morning KPRG played a rerun of an old  urlLink Performance Today  broadcast from last month, the final partitas #6 of  urlLink The Bach Partitas with Richard Goode . Excellent.  urlLink The second hour of PT  was the current program, climaxing with Stravinsky's Rite of Spring at the new  urlLink Walt Disney Concert Hall . Wow.  And  urlLink All Things Considered  ran a  urlLink fascinating piece by Walter Cronkite  about his involvement in CBS' television show "You Are There" during the 1950's. Unknown to Cronkite and most of the show's staff, all the writers on the "You Are There" were  urlLink blacklisted  screenwriters. The writers used historical allegory to make thinly disguised comments about the communist witch hunts of the  urlLink McCarthy  era. It was an absolutely fascinating story, and a true delight to hear Walter Cronkite's voice again.  When I think of the drivel being broadcast on commercial radio on a daily basis, it makes the value of a station like KPRG and NPR truly exceptional. Now if only they would run  urlLink Whad'Ya Know  here on Guam. That is one of my favorites on PRI.

Eisenhower also mentions the dangers inherent in federally funded research at universities, as lone inventors tinkering in their shops are replaced by research labs with government funding.  A strangely prescient speech.

       This strange bright orb is hanging up in the sky. I vaguely remember something about this being the sun, the source of life, warmth and energy for our rainy little planet.  Seriously, this is the first time the sun has come out in force in over a month. The clouds and rain are temporarily dispersed.  Time to set myself loose upon the brilliant day. I think a hike is in order, or maybe a trip to the beach.

       The phones were out this morning. According to GTA, a large portion of the south was without telephone service today - me included.  Seems like the infrastructure to every public utility on Guam is crumbling. The water system is on the verge of collapse. Every week another village is without water due to broken pipes or pumping stations. The power has been a perennial problem since I moved here over ten years ago. The phone system is just as susceptible to failure. In last week's power outage, many areas were left without phones because backup generators at telephone switches were broken or missing.  It gets very frustrating, especially when the rates for every utility have gone up this year. None of that money is going into increasing reliability of the system though; the rate increases are for judicial settlements, unfunded retirement allotments for employees and massive debt loads created by previous administrations. The public utilities desperately need to be privatized but I doubt it will ever happen. Too many jobs are at stake and that makes it a political hot potato. Nobody wants to tackle the agency's problems.

       Guam's only warehouse shopping club, PriceSmart, is  urlLink closing its doors on December 31 st  . Management cites the inability to attract enough members to the price club, saying that the membership feature just doesn't work on Guam for some reason.  I never joined  urlLink PriceSmart , not because of the $20 membership fee, but because I can get everything I need at  urlLink Cost U Less , a competitor without the membership hassles, or  urlLink KMart . Plus I had the feeling PriceSmart would never last; PriceCostco failed in the same location for the same reasons. Why pay for membership when the same things are for sale at a couple other places. Kind of defeats the purpose of a price club.

       Alternet, a sometimes rabidly liberal online site, ran a story on John Paul II's legacy;  urlLink The Totalitarian Pope . Alternet slams John Paul II's papacy for being reactionary, authoritarian and recidivist, especially in regards to the modernization and democratization instigated by  urlLink Vatican II  in the early 1960's. The article concludes that John Paul II's impact on the Church will continue to be felt long after he is succeeded. The Pope has appointed all but four of the current cardinals, and a vast majority of the bishops throughout the world. He canonized more saints in his 25 years than all the popes in the previous 500 years -  combined .  Well Pope John Paul II is certainly a staunchly conservative man, and many of his published encomiums during his remarkably long tenure were marked by an affirmation of traditional values in the face of modern pressures upon the Church. But then the Roman Catholic Church is a remarkably conservative organization to begin with. Just a few years ago,  urlLink the Church finally admitted  that it was wrong to force  urlLink Galileo Galilei  to abjure and renounce his findings in 1633 under threats from the Inquisition. (Talk about holding a grudge!) So this reactionary Pope, who has stacked the College of Cardinals with his disciples, is merely an expression of the Church's innate conservatism.

       I was having a conversation with Chris this afternoon, and it turned to this year being the 100 th  anniversary of the Wright Brother's flight at Kitty Hawk. Au contraire, piped in Chris, some nutball down in Australia or New Zealand  urlLink flew his airplane before the Wright Brothers . His name was Richard Pearse, from New Zealand, also known as Bamboo Dick. Chris said he saw it on a documentary about a New Zealand filmmaker who caught the event on camera and that it actually proved Pearse flew months before Wilbur and Orville's famous flight.  Well, Chris was partly true. The documentary he mentioned was  urlLink  Forgotten Silver  , a parody by Lord of the Rings director  urlLink Peter Jackson . The subject of  Forgotten Silver , a heretofore unknown Kiwi filmmaker called  urlLink Colin McKenzie , was totally fictional. Chris was duped, like much of New Zealand, by the serious tone of the mockumentary.  However, it appears that  urlLink Bamboo Dick  was the  urlLink genuine article . When I visit New Zealand I intend to research this further. A model of his monoplane is supposed to be  urlLink on display  in Auckland.

       It's been a couple hard weeks on the Zulus, my  urlLink fantasy football team . We lost a couple heartbreakers to non-contenders, especially last week's 70-90 loss to 'Reign of Fire.' I can only say it was because both of our top receivers had a bye week. This week however, things are looking better. urlLink Week 7 saw the return of our important starters , including Randy Moss, Chad Johnson and Corey Dillon. Excellent. Too bad we didn't start Dillon, he was a game time decision and our lineups need to be in before that. So we went with D'Shaun Foster, Stephen Davis' backup at Carolina, who put up some decent numbers last week when Davis was hurt.  One area of our roster concerns me - running back. Two of our stable of backs were out this week, Trung Candidate and Anthony Thomas. While they are our backups, our primary back, Clinton Portis and Corey Dillon, are proving more delicate than we hoped. Most of our running backs have something wrong with them and have sat out a couple games this year. Not cool. I want solid running backs that post good numbers every week. But then doesn't everybody?  While Foster didn't put up good numbers for us, it wasn't necessary. The Zulus are poised to win again and become 5-2. The only problem is two other teams in my division are 5-2, making for a clusterf**k. The other two divisions in our league are populated by sad sacks and has beens.

       I just finished watching  urlLink  The Sand Pebbles  , a very good movies about China in the 1920's, when foreign gunboats plied the Yangtze. It stars  urlLink Steve McQueen  and  urlLink Richard Attenborough  as U.S. sailors, and a young  urlLink Candace Bergen  as a missionary teacher. The movie is a powerful allegory for American policy in the 1960's, especially the involvement in Vietnam. Using the upheaval of China in the Twenties, U.S. naval gunboats put American lives in harm's way, ostensibly for the protection of American citizens and businesses. The movie makes it plain that the U.S. military presence only hardens Chinese enmity towards all Americans, ultimately endangering the missionaries and destablizing an already tense situation.  One interesting little trivia tidbit: Richard Attenborough's love interest, the doomed hostess Maily, is played by Marayat Andriane. One look at her and I could tell she was Thai. Looking up the film's cast on the Internet Movie Database led to an interesting discovery. Marayat Andriane is also known as  urlLink Emmanuelle Arsan , the Thai wife of a French diplomat who became a writer and penned a semi-autobiographical novel of sexual promiscuity called  urlLink  Emmanuelle  . Yep, that Emmanuelle,  urlLink the original soft-core film  that graces late night  urlLink Cinemax , along with it's many sequels. In fact Emmanuelle Arsan wrote the screenplay, directed, and acted in some of the Emmanuelle movies. What the hell? Especially peculiar is the fact that the character of Maily is this virginal sacrificial lamb raised by missionaries. Must have been a real stretch sticking a libertine like Emmanuelle into that role. It's like having Ana�s Nin portray a nun in a movie. Just a real nonsequitur.

       Still raining on Guam. Kind of curtails any outside activities. Tried to fire up the water blaster to do some power washing, but the cantankerous machine is fraught with problems. Finally abandoned the effort when the ripcord broke and a downpour began. I don't want to spend my day off in the rain trying to mend an obstinate machine. I'd rather eat some lunch and take a nap.

       The Cubs were  urlLink denied yesterday  in their quest for the World Series and vindication as a sports team. But the real nail in their coffin was in  urlLink Game 6 . The fan. That foul ball in the eighth inning.  Damned by their own fan. Or at least in the eyes of many, he is the scapegoat, the sacrificial lamb.  I feel tremendous pity for Steve Bartman. He did nothing wrong, yet the hatred of an entire city is focused on him. If I was in his place, I would have done the exact same thing.  Things got pretty ugly for the guy  urlLink pretty quick . He was escorted out of the stadium with a coat over his head, while irate fans pelted him with beer and murderous threats. The crowd outside Wrigley Field was pretty ugly and all riled up.  Then the  urlLink Chicago Sun-Times  ran the poor guy's  urlLink name and personal information . He is Steve Bartman, 26. A resident of Chicago's North Side and a Notre Dame graduate, Bartman actually coaches little league ball and is a devout Cubs fan.  urlLink Suffice to say he was disconsolate  at his hand in bringing about the Cub's downfall. He was under police guard during Game 7 yesterday, and his home phone number has been disconnected.  But let's face it. Chicago loves the Cubs because they are a hard-luck team. They are sultans of despair. They blew the NLCS in colossal style,  urlLink snatching defeat from the jaws of victory . And Chicagoland loves 'em for it. They are the lovable losers, with a century of hard luck behind them. It takes determination to be Cubs fan, to revel in the pain it brings. Reminds me of that song  urlLink  Waiting In Vain  : Like Bob Marley, Cubs fans are more in love with the waiting than the girl (or the team).

       A quick trip through the Guam headlines:    urlLink GovGuam Retirement Fund Audit Released  - It took a few years, but the audit of GovGuam Employees Retirement Fund is out. Seems the fund has over $1 billion in unfunded liabilities, due to bad investments and the tendency of lawmakers to dip into the fund to cover governmental expenses. Whoops. Guess that wasn't such a good idea after all guys.   urlLink Yingling Please Innocent  - Gerry Yingling appeared in court yesterday and plead innocent to charges he  used a government credit card to run up thousands of dollars in personal expenses.   urlLink October 13 th  Blackout  - For the third year in a row, the power went out islandwide on October 13 th .  Luckily it was back on by the time I returned Monday evening.   urlLink Jayne Flores Calls Out DOE Leaders  - Jayne Flores, local journalist and editor of Guahan Magazine, called on five DOE directors and principals to retire because of their ineffectual leadership last Thursday. I am sure none of the five will do such a crazy thing - it's not their fault the school system sucks, they only work there. Oh wait, they are the long time, entrenched leadership that guides the school system. I guess it is their fault the schools are falling apart and the children are failing so miserably.   urlLink GovGuam Gets $15 Million Settlement  - GovGuam got a $15 million settlement from the Bank of Guam last week. Guess how much is going to be dispersed to people in the form of long-awaited tax refunds? That's right - none of it. In fact, the legislature was banking on that cash to keep the government afloat.

       I spent the weekend in Tokyo, a guest at the wedding of a former Guam resident. Sumiko moved off Guam about three years ago, but we've kept in touch since. She married  urlLink Go Shimada  on Saturday, and friends converged from around the world to wish her and Go all happiness and joy in the years ahead.       The wedding was held at the  urlLink New Otani Hotel  in Tokyo, and it was beautiful. The party lasted well into the night, first at formal dinner in the New Otani's Ho-oh Ballroom and then at  urlLink Zipangu , atop the  urlLink Akasaka Excel Hotel Tokyu . Among the guests were a sizable contingent from  urlLink Thunderbird , the graduate school in Arizona where Go and Sumiko first met.       My friend Annie, also a former Guamanian, came to the wedding from San Francisco.       Guess who got the bouquet when Sumiko tossed it?       It was a good trip. I spent Sunday shopping with Annie and her friend Liz and Sandy. Or I guess I should say they went shopping in Harajuku while I went to see the Meiji Jingu Shrine and walk around Yoyogi Park. Sunday night they went down to Roppongi (Gas Panic!) while I met my friend David Neale for dinner in Ogikubo. Dave is putting on  True West  this week, so I was lucky he could spare a few hours to hook up with me.  I spent a good deal of my free time wandering around this trip. Tokyo is just about as different from Guam as any place can be. Millions of people, all in a hurry. Millions of things to do, places to go, sites to see. It is very easy to become lost in the immensity of the place. Hell I could ride around on trains all day and be happy. To escape the daily routine, and discover new places and people. I am sure that is why people come to Guam, and many see it as an exotic, idyllic place. The allure of a tropical island wears off after so many years. I find myself craving cities, culture and mobs of people. Losing myself in a crowd, melting away to nothing, it holds a nihilistic appeal to me.  A funny thing, the newlyweds honeymooned on Guam! They were at the Hilton for a few days, and I met up with them yesterday. They look quite happy together. They left today for Japan, to resume their busy lives.  I will say this. I got a taste of the big city in Tokyo, and I definitely will be visiting more often.

       Boy, the weight of history was against the Cubs this year. Up 3-1 in the NLCS and the Marlins came back to win the series and go to the World Series. I just watched the last couple innings of the game and the Wrigley Field crowd was numb. The final out left the ballpark quiet. Only the Marlins dancing around the infield showed any joy. I think the entire crowd was weeping.

       Monday's PDN had a whopper of a story: an 81 year old veteran says he knows where Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan are buried:  urlLink In an overgrown patch of jungle on Tinian .  Stories of Earhart's demise swirl around the Marianas, mostly because of one Saipanese woman's story about how she saw Japanese authorities imprisoning an American woman in the late thirties on Saipan. No one has ever confirmed this story, and historians are skeptical. This new story is similar, though the particulars take place on Tinian, the island due south of Saipan.  According to Saint John Naftel, he was approached in 1944 by a Hawaiian laborer on Tinian. The Hawaiian told him that shortly after he arrived on Tinian in 1937, the Japanese made him bury to Americans, a man and a woman, in aviator suits. The Hawaiian showed Naftel the burial sight, but Naftel never reported it because of the war.  Naftel finally told his story to local archaeologists, and Jennings Bunn agreed to help Naftel locate the long lost burial site. The veteran arrived last weekend and located the site the Hawaiian laborer identified so many decades ago.  Frankly I have my doubts. It's a big ocean, and the odds are that Earhart and Noonan are lying at the bottom of it. Saipan and Tinian were both well off Earhart's route, and if she was captured by Japanese, it's likely they took her to the military headquarters in Truk Lagoon.  Still, the story does capture my imagination. Jennings Bunn is busy securing the permits to dig on Tinian and he hopes to commence an archaeological study by the end of the year.

       From the Guardian comes a wild story; Vatican says urlLink  condoms don't stop AIDS . The Holy Mother Church says condoms cannot stop HIV, nor limit the spread of AIDS.

The Church would rather risk spreading the disease than address sexual habits openly and maturely and support a prophylactic device. The Church totters closer to irrelevance with every passing year.

       We engineered a nice little trade last week, pulled in a kicker and a running back for this weekend's games. And it worked out nicely. Bagged another win to put us in sole possession of first place in our division.  Say hello to  urlLink Trung Candidate  and  urlLink Sebastian Janikowski , the newest players on our squad.  This week is the supplemental draft, and we'll be picking up some more guys. We got a few guys that are no longer needed, and some areas of the lineup need bolstering.  It's funny, last year we were the most prolific team trading and drafting players with abandon. Our final squad bore little resemblance to our draft picks. For some reason, the other owners in the league are reticent about trades, and skittish about drafting players during the season. Perhaps they are too deeply attached to their draft picks. Hell, we traded away our #1 pick last year mid-season. Shaun Alexander was playing like a feeb, so we ditched him to another team for Jamal Lewis and a receiver. And never looked back. Lots of guys are determined to hang onto their players, probably because of pride or hubris. They don't want to look silly for drafting an underperformer. Even worse, they often don't want to trade those players away, thinking they are too valuable to their team. Dude, everybody's expendable. It's what they bring to the table that matters.

       I am heading out on vacation tonight. 10 days in New Zealand. I promise to take lots of pictures for show and tell. I might even find time to make a couple posts up here. I doubt it though.  True to form,  urlLink a storm is brewing  out east of Guam. It is expected to pass south of the island on Sunday, but the true direction of the storm is still sketchy. I hope it doesn't hit. It will certainly make me anxious the next couple nights.  Speaking of anxious, my father had another hip replacement surgery on Monday. I was rather worried about him, he's 82 now and major invasive surgery isn't exactly easy. But I talked to my mom and he is doing fine. He even walked 20 feet today with help from the nurses. She expects him home on Friday. Good luck Dad!  That's about it. I'll try and make a couple posts when I am in Auckland.  Esta Gupa!

I prefer  urlLink  The Big Sleep   though.  urlLink Mary Astor  just doesn't compare to  urlLink Lauren Bacall .  Saturday late night I watched Spike Lee's  urlLink  25 th  Hour  . Easily the best movie I've seen all month. It was a powerful film which followed a man's last day in New York City before he starts a long prison term. While he doesn't express much regret for his crimes, he certainly realizes this is it. He's fucked up and the jig is up. I really enjoyed the entire movie; while it is kind of slow-paced the ending is a gut-wrencher. And  urlLink Rosario Dawson  - Whoa Nelly! The woman gives me palpitations.

       I got a new driver's license this morning. It took almost 50 minutes to renew my license. I had to interact with 9 people at the DMV. It cost $5 for my new license.  No wonder the government has no money. It should have taken 10-15 minutes tops to get this done. Instead I had to tromp around from window to window, filling out a form, passing a form between enough people to field a baseball team, walking to another window, picking up another form, walking to another window... All those people pushing paper around, collecting a nice government paycheck and collecting my $5. Just killing time down at the DMV.   My dad had surgery on Monday. Another hip replacement - or I guess it's actually a replacement of the hip replacement. I was anxious about him getting this surgery, but it sounds like he made it through okay and is recovering nicely. That's a relief. Here's to a quick recovery!

       I briefly laid out Thursday and Friday night's activities yesterday. It was a busy weekend, with lots of interesting events.  Saturday night I popped into the  urlLink KPRG  member appreciation party at  urlLink Da 'Ranch  in Harmon. I only stayed for a half hour, mostly due to a dearth of funds in my wallet. My generosity gets the best of me at times. That was the first time I'd been inside that space since the  urlLink P.U.B.  microbrewery  urlLink shut down several years ago . Boy, I really miss that place. They made some wicked brews up there - I got shitfaced there many a night.  Anyway, that was a brief sojourn out for the weekend. Sunday I worked most of the day up in Tamuning, then spent about three hours at the Laundromat on the way home. Sunday night I went to the Hilton for  urlLink  Jazz for Wishes  , a benefit concert with  urlLink Larry Franquez  and  urlLink Sadao Watanabe , a  urlLink huge jazz star in Japan .  It was excellent  - I just wish I could have stayed for the entire concert. I had to come back home and put my nose back to the grindstone. Too much work to do before Monday.  I spend way too much time in front of a computer. I need a vacation...

       Found this interesting little tidbit about how authors and publishers are blaming libraries for  urlLink a slump in book sales . Hmm...  In a related note, I got a library card this weekend. Stopped off at the Nieves Flores library in Hag�t�a. I let my last one expire a few years ago. Why? Because the library sucks. Seriously. I should have taken some pictures. The new acquisitions section was about 12 books, all of them automobile manuals. The periodicals are all about 3 to 4 years old, there's no money for subscriptions. The air conditioning is busted so the library has this funky, musty odor; and the computers don't work. The place is wreck. But then I am not surprised. Our elected officials are more interested in fattening their own pockets than creating a stable, thriving community. One look at the plummeting test scores, crumbling infrastructure and reduced services should reveal that.  urlLink Sunday's opinion page  of the PDN lays out what is wrong and how to fix it.

       Well I had other plans for tonight, but they didn't pan out. So I came back home and popped Naqoyqatsi into the DVD player.  I watched  urlLink Koyaanisqatsi  and  urlLink Powaqqatsi  a few months ago, and my feelings were mixed. Koyaanisqatsi was just about the coolest thing I'd ever seen; powerful visuals and an engaging score by Philip Glass. Wow. Powaqqatsi left me cold though, it didn't have the visceral impact of the first film. It was a good film, but it wasn't as powerful as  urlLink Koyaanisqatsi . I really preferred the time-lapse stuff in Koyaanisqatsi; by speeding up the mundane, hidden patterns emerged.  Long, arduous scenes of people toiling in the mud irks me.  And now I've seen  urlLink Naqoyqatsi , the final installment of the trilogy. Life out balance, life in transition, and finally life as war. Life as a series of TV spots, commercials, sporting events, news clips and computer animations. Again, I am left unmoved. Maybe I am inured to the images Godfrey Reggio uses. I thought this would really hit the mark, now that we live in a never ending War on Terror. The brief appearance of Osama Bin Laden chilled me, but the never ending footage in negative, spliced with crummy computer animation really bugged me. Enough already. I've seen all this before in a plethora of other movies, and it was of better quality. And somebody sure like  urlLink Adobe After Effects .  I don't think Naqoyqatsi is a bad film, it certainly drives home the point of technology usurping nature as our primary interface with reality. As a film though, Naqoyqatsi is middle of the road. While Koyaanisqatsi was years ahead of its time, other filmmakes have caught up, and exceeded the visuals produced in that original film. Naqoyqatsi is squarely middle of the road.

       A plethora of activities here as the year winds down.    Thursday night I went to the November show at the  urlLink UOG Planetarium . It was my first time to visit the planetarium on the  urlLink UOG campus , and I enjoyed it immensely. I stayed up extra late Thursday night to catch the peak of  urlLink this year's Leonid shower  on Guam. I saw several shooting stars, but perhaps I am tainted by the extraordinary showers of the last few years. I wasn't too impressed by what I saw. Of course the cloud cover made it difficult to fully enjoy the spectacle.  On Friday night I worked late at the office and then stopped off at UOG again on my way home. This time I caught the  urlLink opening night performance  of David Auburn's  urlLink  Proof  , a play about  urlLink mathematics , genius, madness, and  urlLink the fine line  between the two. I wish the play had more mathematics in it, but I enjoyed it immensely nonetheless.  The weekend is about half over, and I still have lots to do. More on that tomorrow...

        urlLink What's New and Cool in SQL Server "Yukon" :   Big thing #1:  T-SQL has several new data types, including native handling for XML data, which is covered in the following section.  There are also three new data-related data types: Date, Time and UtcDateTime.  These new types have better accuracy and range than their existing counterparts, DateTime and SmallDateTime.  (You can say that again)  They are also special implementations of .NET user-defined data types, and thus they have several special properties and methods that allow you to get portions of the date or time and even convert it to a string using a user-specified format.  Big thing #2:  T-SQL now has the ability to pivot and unpivot data. No more dynamic T-SQL or overly complex SELECT statements � now you can use this new ability to create crosstabulated data results. These two SELECT statements will give the same results, but obviously, the second is a lot easier to write, especially if we are dealing with more than three pivoted output columns. SELECT ProductID, ProductName,       SUM(CASE TheYear WHEN 1996 THEN Extended ELSE 0 END) AS [1996],      SUM(CASE TheYear WHEN 1997 THEN Extended ELSE 0 END) AS [1997],      SUM(CASE TheYear WHEN 1998 THEN Extended ELSE 0 END) AS [1998] FROM vwOrderDetails GROUP BY ProductID, ProductName  SELECT * FROM vwOrderDetails PIVOT (SUM(Extended) FOR TheYear IN ([1996], [1997], [1998])) AS PVT  I make a lot of crosstabs, this will come in  very  handy.

        Movies     urlLink The Matrix Revolutions  -  Okay, it was better than I thought last week, but it still didn't meet my expectations. I was hoping for some sort of merging of machine and man, a new stage of evolution. Instead I got status quo and a humdrum action flick. Oh, and plenty of "Neo is Christ" references.   urlLink McCabe & Mrs. Miller  - Wish they made more like this. An adult movie with complexity and depth. Fine performances by  urlLink Warren Beatty  and  urlLink Julie Christie . And that lonely, desolate score by Leonard Cohen haunts me.   urlLink The Usual Suspects  - The first thing I remember  urlLink Kevin Spacey  in, and the last thing I remember  urlLink Stephen Baldwin ,  urlLink Gabriel Byrne  and  urlLink Chazz Palminteri  being in.   urlLink Traffic  - I never bothered to watch this before. It was powerful, in a heavy-handed Hollywood way. It seemed to say, "This is an important film - like  urlLink Gandhi  or something. You must watch it." Yeah yeah, whatever.   urlLink Get Shorty  -  You watch it and POOF! It's gone without a trace. Fluffy McFluff-Fluff. But fun. I'm sure people in the movie business thought it was great. If you listen closely you can here them smirking and sniggering behind the camera in every scene.   urlLink LA Confidential  - Film noir with a modern twist.   urlLink The Young Lions  - Hmm. Seen this before and I can't remember why I put it on my Netflix queue. Maybe to watch  urlLink Montgomery Clift  get the crap beat out him? Or possibly it is  urlLink Marlon Brando's  weird German accent and bottled blonde hair?   urlLink A Midnight Clear  - Another WWII movie. This one with a bunch of whiny Gen-X'ers taking over a chateau in the snow.    urlLink The Sand Pebbles  -  urlLink Steve McQueen  turns in probably his best performance in this one. I really enjoyed this movie. A slice of history not often portrayed in films.   urlLink Abre Los Ojos  - The Spanish version of  urlLink Vanilla Sky . Same plot, different language - same  urlLink Penelope Cruz , but a lot more naked. While Vanilla Sky had a better soundtrack, this one has Penelope Cruz naked. Need I say more?   urlLink Waking Life  -  Big Brains and lots of talk. So many ideas are bursting out of this amazing little animated movie. A real treat.   urlLink The Bridge On The River Kwai  -   urlLink William Holden  and  urlLink Alec Guinness , a classic war film.  That's about all I've seen in the past two months. All those war movies have skewed Netflix into offering me every action and war movie in their library. At least Netflix doesn't  urlLink think I'm gay , but they do think I'm some blood lust enraged war monger. Guess it's time to rent  urlLink Three Men and a Baby .

       Week 10 of fantasy football saw one team emerge in sole possession of first place in the  urlLink Guam Fantasy Football League . Yes, yours truly is sitting in cat bird seat, with four more weeks of regular season play and then the finals. One more week of inter-divisional play, then it's back into the Central Division to secure our playoff spot. It won't be a cake walk though, the Central Division is the toughest in the league, all four teams capable of breakout performances. Still, we stand a good chance of winning our division, or at least securing the wild card playoff berth. The pot for fantasy football is almost $700 this year. I could sure use that money. Especially right before Christmas.  It was a good week for  urlLink the Zulus . We traded away  urlLink Santana Moss , our 12 th  round pick for  urlLink Steve McNair , the #1 fantasy quarterback in our league. Frankly I am amazed the trade was approved. Quite a coup for us. And since last week was the supplemental draft, we picked up a number of promising players like  urlLink Rudi Johnson  and  urlLink Jim Kleinsasser . Rudi was a really choice catch and he proved it by becoming our leading scorer for the weekend, powering us past Da Bruddahs. I think the team looks pretty solid, especially now that all the bye weeks are over and we have a solid roster. No more switching in scrubs to garner a few points while the starters take the weekend off.

        urlLink  All Things Considered   ran a story on lytico-bodig today. The gist of it was nothing new; another scientist thinks lytico-bodig was caused by  urlLink eating fruit bats  in the thirties and forties.   urlLink I've heard this before . The theory runs that lytico-bodig is caused the the toxins in the seeds of cycad palms, a common plant on Guam. The Marianas fruit bat, or  fanihi  eats the seeds of the cycad and the BMAA neurotoxins accumulate in the bat. When people eat the bat, they receive a dangerous dose of the toxins. In the 1940's firearms became prevalent on Guam and bats were hunted in large numbers.  I don't know - this theory has a pretty big hole. People still eat  fanihi , yet lytico-bodig is a disappearing. Only the elderly suffer from lytico-bodig now. Add to that the fact that most incidences of lytico-bodig occur in a few southern villages and in people that lived in those villages during the 30's and 40's and it seems likely a more local environmental variable was inducing lytico-bodig in the population. Like maybe something  urlLink in the water supply , or dietary practices of a few related families.  An interesting book about this is  urlLink  The Island of the Colorblind  , by Dr. Oliver Sacks.

       I went to  urlLink Saipan  this weekend. No particular reason, I just wanted to get away from Guam for a couple days. I was last there four years ago, and I felt the need to check out Guam's close neighbor. So I went up for a day to check it out and scout around.  Saipan's about 120 miles north of Guam and a quick 28 minute flight on  urlLink Continental . I flew up after work on Friday night and still had plenty of time to catch dinner and the night life in Garapan.  I checked into the  urlLink Pacific Gardenia  for the night and slept late. It's a funky little hotel way off the main hotel row up in Garapan. I liked it. Lots of woodwork and high ceilings. And it was cheap.   urlLink Saipan's  got quite a few nice restaurants too. Ate lunch at  urlLink Coffee Care , a coffeehouse/Thai restaurant. Again, it's got a funky, offbeat appeal. It's quite the popular place with the expat crowd too.  After lunch it was time for some sight-seeing. The northern end of Saipan is  urlLink chock full of historical sights  and scenic vistas so I headed that way. It was raining cats and dogs though, so I stopped off at La Fiesta San Roque, an outdoor mall next to the Hotel Nikko Saipan.  La Fiesta is a weird place. Ten years ago it looked beautiful and desolate, and it is still beautiful and desolate. Easily 75% of the storefronts are vacant at La Fiesta, and it is a crying shame. The complex is just beautiful; exquisite gardens, fountains and plazas with all these empty stores. It's a colossal failure as a retail environment, but I understand that the Northern Marianas College is moving into one section of the mall. That is a better use of an excellent space.  Here's some photos of La Fiesta:                   The rain stopped while I was there, so I continued north to visit the war memorials. First stop, Banzai Cliff overlooking the Pacific. Hundreds of Japanese jumped into the ocean rather than surrender to GI's during the battle for Saipan. The site is now littered with memorials for the deceased and monuments to peace.       Behind this memorial is the towering presence of  urlLink Suicide Cliff , visible in the background. 800 feet above the surrounding savanna, Suicide Cliff was also the site of hundreds of Japanese soldiers and civilians plunging to their doom in the face of the oncoming Americans. Memorials stand atop the precipice, silent witness to the sorrow of that windswept place.          That was it for the sightseeing, I had to dash back down to the airport to catch my flight. I guess I need to stay longer next time. I definitely won't wait another four years before I return.

        urlLink Here's a little piece  about the shrinking sense of distance in today's world.  I remember when my sister moved from the Midwest to New York City with her husband in the mid 70's. It was like she moved to Timbuktu. I can vividly remember once when the entire family was getting together - Thanksgiving I believe. My father came home from his job at Southwestern Bell with a speakerphone because my sister was going to call long distance and talk to the family. When the call came in the entire family, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, all of us shut up and crouched around that tinny speakerphone, listening, listening. She only spoke for a few minutes, long distance was prohibitively expensive for a young couple eking out a living in the big city. I was duly amazed.  I made three long distance phone calls today, scoured computers on three continents, booked a flight, reserved a hotel room and rental car, and I barely thought about the cost to me for those calls or the technology behind them. We live in a golden age.

       I'm reading  urlLink an interview with Saturday Night Live head writer Tina Fey . It's pretty interesting look into how  urlLink SNL  operates and Fey's place in it. I don't watch much SNL these days, but the "Weekend Update" section with Fey and Jimmy Fallon is probably the most consistent thing on the show.  The obligatory biographical stuff is there too, along with this gem about the comedy stylings of a young Tina Fey:  "[her brother] remembers a drawing that Tina made when she was about seven: it showed people walking down the street holding hands with wedges of Swiss cheese, and the caption read, 'What a friend we have in cheeses!'"

       Here's an interesting essay by physicist  urlLink Michio Kaku  on the  urlLink physics of extra-terrestrial civilizations . A very lucid article and  urlLink some great comments  on Dr. Kaku's essay can be found on  urlLink this website . Some of the idea's Dr. Kaku touches upon reminded me of a novel I read last year,  urlLink  Diaspora  , by Greg Egan. This novel was 'hard' sci-fi, full of physics and mathematics, and a little like in character development. The ideas Egan puts forward, sentient cyber intelligences exploring the galaxy, basically hibernating during the millennia of interstellar travel, then unleashing a horde of nanotech robots to establish a beach head in new solar systems for exploration and industry, is remarkably similar to Kaku's discussion of Von Neumann  probes exploring the galaxy.  The best part about the comments are the  urlLink great links  to  urlLink other articles  about the  urlLink development  of  urlLink mankind  and  urlLink human civilization . Especially read  urlLink the article  about the origins of human language. It is very informative.

       Now here's something you don't hear about everyday: a documentary about  urlLink the CIA-back insurgency in Tibet  during the 50's and 60's. The CIA trained and financed a paramilitary operation by Tibetan nationalists until the early 1970's, when Nixon established relations with Communist China. And the story has a local flavor too; the CIA trained many of the counter revolutionaries on Saipan. I'd heard stories about CIA training Chinese agents on Saipan in the 60's, but I never guessed it was actually Tibetans learning how to monitor radio frequencies, master cryptography and make Molotov cocktails.

       Time for a brief spin through local news from Guam and the region:    urlLink Carl Gutierrez Indicted!!  -  Holy Crap!  It's about time... I was wondering when somebody would get around to  urlLink indicting Gutierrez . The charges against Gutierrez revolve around the misappropriation of materials and services to build his home in Uranao. Also indicted was his Department of Administration director, Cliff Guzman. Guzman's indictment centers around the illegal connection of 2400 streetlights installed on private property but paid for with government funds. KUAM has a good rundown on all the current charges, pending indictments and prior convictions surrounding Gutierrez and his term as governor of Guam.   urlLink Funeral for Slain Family  - The grandparents of the slain DePaiva family embraced forgiveness at yesterday's funeral in Palau. Ruth DePaiva, mother of slain SDA pastor Ruimar DePaiva, embraced the mother of accused murderer Justin Hirosi and prayed for her and her son. I am truly humbled at a display of God's love and human compassion expressed by some people. I don't know if I could forgive anyone if my children and grandchildren were sexually assaulted and murdered in such a wild orgy of violence. I would be screaming for blood. This 'eye for an eye' thirst for vengeance only incites further hatred and a cycle of escalating violence, eg Palestine or Kosovo. But perhaps there is hope for our species if more people embrace compassion and forgiveness instead of hatred and vengeance.   urlLink Talofofo Bay Erosion  - Talofofo Bay is getting larger at the expense of Talofofo Bay Beach Park. Wave action is chewing up large sections of the park, a process accelerated by last year's typhoons. A large chunk of the parking lot at the park collapsed a few years ago, and the latest casualty is a picnic shelter that fell into the waves last week.   urlLink Navy Hiker Dies on Boonie Stomp  - A Navy man lost his life hiking in Cetti Bay on Saturday.  urlLink A memorial service  was scheduled for today.

       Local grocers raced to  urlLink issue statements  that they do not have any of the tainted beef from that slaughterhouse in Washington state. Both major grocers, Cost-U-Less and Payless Supermarkets repeated assurances that they do not have any of the 10,000 pounds of beef that was processed with the infected Holstein cow on December 9. In addition they added that meat processed on December 9 is still in transit and has not reached the island yet.  Frankly I am little worried about this. I got to thinking about what I put in my stomach the last few days and I know I ate leftover prime rib on Thursday, a hamburger at  urlLink Jeff's Pirates Cove  on Saturday and I made hamburger helper for dinner last night. If I lived someplace on the mainland like California this wouldn't really bother me, but since I live on an island with only 150,000 people on it, my chances are greatly increased to come in contact with this stuff. Guess I'll be eating more fish for the foreseeable future. At least the  urlLink mercury poisoning  is reversible, there's no cure for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

       Television comes in odd batches to our little island. Mostly things play about a week later here with the exception of a few satellite channels: CNN, Fox News, and ESPN notably. The rest comes piecemeal. Sometimes it shows when you expect it, other times their is a certain randomness in the television programming. Maybe a Wednesday's tape was bad so they tossed in Saturday's tape instead. It makes it hard to actually plan on seeing anything out here. That's probably a good thing.  All this preamble is just to get around to my point: I sat through the  urlLink Battlestar Galactica  mini-series on the  urlLink Sci Fi Channel  tonight, apparently weeks after it  urlLink originally aired  back in the States. I remember the original  urlLink Battlestar Galactica  as mildly entertaining fluff from 1978 or so. I mostly remember how those guys crash landed on a different planet with human settlers every week. It was like they had a crash rotation schedule set up between Starbuck and Apollo. It got pretty stale. Then they made it to Earth and fried a Cylon with a microwave oven at Wolfman Jack's  urlLink Halloween party .  Anyway, back to the new  urlLink Battlestar Galactica : I enjoyed it thoroughly. The story was retooled nicely, the special effects were pretty good, and the mini-series created a nice sense of dread about the Cylon menace. The Robots-That-Look-Just-Like Humans angle was a poor decision, but at least they cast a stunningly beautiful woman in very little clothes as the female Cylon-spy. I am quite willing to accept that hackneyed plot device as long as she stays minimally clothed. The storyline was fairly engaging too. I think the main problem with the show was too much going on with too many people doing it. I felt like I needed a scorecard to follow who was who and what they were doing. On the plus side, some of the subplots were enjoyable (Baltar's guilty conscience, the love affair between the pilot girl and her crew chief) and I found they really engaged me in the story. And the battles in space were top notch. They actually looked like spaceships flying in zero gravity instead of airplanes banking around in the night sky. If anything, the space battles look like something out of that video game  urlLink Homeworld : gigantic ships launching a fusillade of missiles at each other with smaller attack ships buzzing about the periphery.  All in all I give it a thumbs up and I hope that it becomes a tv series. I wouldn't mind catching it every now then on my random island television.

       Time for more photos from the land of the Kiwis!  urlLink Last time I posted pictures  from the first few days of my trip, in and around Auckland. This time we leave the city and head south into the countryside for a little road trip.   Tuesday, November 25  Woke up with a bit of a hangover. Guess I was drinking too late into the night with David, Teresa and Tesua. They forced me, I swear!  Anyway by the time I was presentable and made it upstairs everybody else was up and getting ready for the day's adventures. Our plan was to head south from Auckland and visit  urlLink Rotorua , a geothermal area that was New Zealand's #1 tourist destination. We also had a loose plan to visit  urlLink Matamata , a small farming community north of Rotorua, and see the farm that was the location for the Shire in the  urlLink Lord of the Rings  movies.   Teresa pulled the kids out of  urlLink school  for a couple days and they were very excited about that. David finished marking his exams for the semester and we were ready to go by around 1000 that morning. We had a minivan reservation with  urlLink A2B Rentals , so we went down to the rental agency and about 45 minutes later we were on the road in a Toyota Previa.  First stop was the Newmarket area for some last minute shopping and lunch. I am sorry to report I took the longest during this stop. I bought a 256 mb memory stick on Saturday, but I couldn't figure out how to work it. I decided to stop back in at  urlLink Noel Leeming  computer store and get their advice (or a refund). Turned out my camera was too old and couldn't handle the 256 mb stick. After much deliberation on the phone, the sales kid helping me actually went across the street to a competitor and brought two 128 mb memory sticks back for me. That was excellent customer service Mr. Gregory Ramshaw. Thank you very much.  We gassed up the minivan and finally hit the road. It was after 1300 by the time we left, but everyone said the trip to Rotorua would only take about 3 � hours.      The drive south was uneventful. Pleasant, rolling countryside. Lots and lots and lots of sheep. Just like in Australia, once we got out of the city's environs the expressway reverted into a two lane blacktop. Hard to believe that two lane highway was the country's main north-south artery. Guess that's all you need when the country's population is 3 million people.  We got into Rotorua around 1600 that afternoon and drove around looking for our hotel. We finally located the  urlLink Regal Geyserland Hotel , and it truly lived up to its name. The hotel abuts the Whakarewarewa geothermal area and our room offered a great view of the Pohutu geyser and mudpools. It was an impressive view, even if the entire city smelled terrible.      After dropping our bags in the room and settling in, it was time to wander around the city. We drove to the city centre, did some sightseeing, and located a promising restaurant.  urlLink The Lone Star Cafe  was a pleasant place to stop and rest our weary bones and get some tasty food. I was a little concerned that the name of this restaurant would invite a lawsuit from a similarly named  urlLink US chain of restaurants .      After dinner we did some more sightseeing and found some really cool stuff. Rotorua is just an amazing city, everywhere we went there was evidence of geothermal activity. Hot springs, mudpots, geysers - it was incredible. I think the most disconcerting part for me was driving around and looking at somebody's lawn. Right in the middle of their yard, a smoking fumarole was belching sulfurous clouds of steam. Call me old fashioned, but I don't think I'd consider high volcanic activity a good reason to build a city.               These photos don't really do the place justice. Luckily my digital camera can record movies too. If you want to watch a 15 megabyte movie of that mudpot above, just follow  urlLink this link . Don't say I didn't warn you though, it's a big file and will take a long time to download.  By this point it was getting dark, so we retired to the Regal Geyserland and watched a Monday Night Football on  urlLink Sky TV .   Wednesday November 26  Wednesday it was dark and stormy. The weather was just awful. It looked beautiful outside with all the steam and the rainfall, but I had no desire to go tramping around in the rain. Over breakfast the adults decided to cancel our plans for fun in Rotorua that morning. We were hoping to try out the  urlLink ZORB  and then ride  urlLink the cable car  and  urlLink luge attraction . But the rain was unrelenting and after our brief t�te a t�te over breakfast we chose to leave Rotorua and hope the rain would let up as we drove north towards Matamata. The kids weren't too happy about this, they really wanted to check out these adventure activities. Well, who said life is fair?  Sure enough, the weather started clearing up as we drove north. By the time we reached Matamata, the rain was intermittent with patches of blue sky. I won't go into details but it took us some time to find the place in Matamata that sold tickets for the  urlLink Hobbiton tours . After getting lowdown on this place, and the exorbitant prices, we were on our way back to Auckland. They wanted $50 a head to visit this farm  and the Hobbiton set wasn't even there anymore . Plus the next tour wasn't until 1500 in the afternoon as we just missed the noon tour. Thanks but no thanks.  We drove back to Auckland and by the time we reached the city around 1400, the weather was clear and sunny. David felt bad about cutting our trip short, so he drove us to the top of  urlLink Mount Eden , an extinct volcano, for a look around.         We grabbed some food at a nearby pub,  urlLink Galbraith's Alehouse . The food was good, the beer was better.            That's about it for Wednesday. We went back to Parnell, chilled out for a bit then went to dinner in Mission Bay. Our restaurant was in the  urlLink old stone church  that was the original mission in Mission Bay. The food was excellent, a fine dining experience. We took a drive through the city after dinner. Our destination was an immense supermarket. Thursday was Thanksgiving after all, we had to make preparations for our feast.   Thursday November 27 - Thanksgiving  Thursday morning - and Thanksgiving to boot! My last full day in New Zealand, it was all too short.  The kids trundled off to school and the adults went to the  urlLink Auckland Museum  for a little culturabsorptionon. The first floor of the museum was chock full of Maori and Pacific Islander exhibits; canoes, paddles, weaving, carving. Wow. I was in heaven. Check out the war canoe in the last image:            We went upstairs briefly, but the second floor paled in comparison with the treasures on the first floor. I think there were dinosaurs and stuff, but it didn't interest me.  That afternoon I did some gift shopping at  urlLink Victoria Market , pulling together Christmas presents for family and friends. We ended up grabbing a bite to eat at  urlLink the Bog  on Parnell Rise, where I put away one last pint of Guinness.            We got back around 1500, just in time to catch the kids coming home from school. Jordan had a basketball game after school, and I discovered that my digital camera doesn't take sports/action shots very well. This is the best of the bunch, Jordan making a free throw late in the game.      After Jordan's victory in the final game of the season we headed back to Alberon St. and our Thanksgiving feast. Turkey proved too difficult to locate for Thanksgiving, but the local butcher did provide us with a wonderful ham. Toss in mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, cranberries, fresh salad and a loaf of hot bread, and it was a magnificent meal.               What a feast. Nobody could move after all that delicious food. Teresa really outdid herself cooking up all those dishes. I'd like to say I helped clean up, but I was pretty much comatose after eating all that food. We rounded out the night watching a couple dvd's and looking out over the Auckland skyline.   Friday November 28  That's pretty much it. I left the next morning for Australia, but not until after Teresa made the  best  damn omelet I've ever eaten. After that, I was off to the airport in the early morning sunrise.         One last thing: a couple of the  urlLink Air New Zealand  747's were decorated with Middle Earth themes. Here's one with Aragorn and Legolas painted on the side.      New Zealand was a lot of fun. I realized too late that one week was nowhere near long enough to visit such a large and fascinating country. Next time I go I will definitely plan on spending more time in Aotearoa, Land of the Long White Cloud.

       It was a nail-biter, but we emerged victorious in our  urlLink fantasy football league . We scraped by with the narrowest of margins, only 1.5 fantasy points. The prize money comes just in time for Christmas.  Our final lineup was an amazing piece of work: two sub-par running backs filling in for the injured Clinton Portis, a surprise performance from our mediocre tight end, negative points from the Tampa Bay defense and Matt Hasselbeck gets injured in what should be his biggest game of the year. Somehow our stitched together lineup put up enough points to edge out our rival. Of course the biggest help was the fact that both his star wide receivers were injured and came up with goose eggs. It was a miracle - or the infamous Zulu Curse...

       Enough dawdling around, it's time I post some pictures here and talk about my trip to New Zealand. I'll break it up into digestible portions - today's serving is from the first few days of my trip in Auckland.  The impetus for my trip was a visit to Auckland my friend David Tibbetts. He left Guam in February to pursue a PhD at the  urlLink University of Auckland  and I promised him I would visit. The best time for this trip was around Thanksgiving since I got a surfeit of paid holidays that week. So I booked my tickets and let David know I was coming at the end of November.  I left Guam on Thursday, November 20 on Continental Flight 901 and arrived shortly after midnight Friday in Cairns, Queensland Australia. I knocked off Pynchon's   The Crying of Lot 49   during the flight and totally ignored   Chicago  , the in-flight movie.  I arranged the tickets myself without a travel agent, and I think I managed it quite nicely. I had to overnight in Cairns before my flight to Auckland the next afternoon, but a couple friends that happened to be on the Continental flight were flying on to Sydney at 0600 that morning, then to Auckland that afternoon and ultimately to Christchurch, their final destination. No thanks - especially if I had to make that trip with a 2 year old child like they did.  Anyway I had to stay in Cairns for the night, so I booked a room at  the Bellview , right on the Esplanade in central Cairns. Instead of sleeping, I started another book,   Flowers for Algernon  , and read that until about 0500. When I got up a few hours later I met the owners of the Bellview. Rodney and Sheryl Meiklejohn are excellent hoteliers and made me feel most welcome during my short stay. In fact, I booked a room with them for my return through Cairns at the end of the trip - but that's for another date.  My Air New Zealand flight to Auckland left at 1300 that afternoon, so I had time to kill. I checked email and found David's post-flight instructions on locating his place in Parnell. Then it was off to the airport. This flight was rather long and crowded. But I thanks to those killer  noise-canceling headphones  I could tune out most of the flight and catch some zzz's. I got into Auckland a little after 2100 local time.  After clearing immigration and customs I got on the  SuperShuttle bus  and it took me directly to David's house in Parnell. That was damn handy. I had arrived! Many welcomes and a frosty cold beer awaited me. Almost everybody was up to greet me; David, his girlfriend Teresa and her boy Jordan. The little girl, Sasha, was already asleep since it was so late when I finally arrived. I got a quick tour of the house and the balcony with it's killer view of central Auckland and the harbor, then Teresa whipped up some food for a late meal. We drank beers until late and talked story.     The next morning was clear and sunny. Over breakfast we discussed our plans for the the day.  A tour of downtown Auckland was in order and perhaps some wanderings through Parnell, the neighborhood where they lived. We left the house and walked down the street to a rose garden that was in full bloom. The kids were quite boisterous and excited, somebody from Guam had come to visit them! I took several photos of the kids scrambling around the park and climbing a big old tree that sprawled across the northern end of the park. After a nice photo of central Auckland, we caught a bus downtown and did some sightseeing around Waitemata harbor and the Viaduct area.          The photo above shows our destination, the  urlLink Sky Tower , the tallest building in the southern hemisphere. We left Teresa and the kids next door before riding the lifts to the top of the building. The view from the observation deck was magnificent. Auckland is a sea-loving city, and from our perch high above the harbor we could see dozens of sailboats plying the waters of the Hauraki Gulf. Looking south I could spot  urlLink One Tree Hill  and  urlLink Mount Eden , two tall volcanic hills and local landmarks. David pointed out  urlLink the university campus  and the general location of  urlLink Parnell  in the middle distance.         We got back down to the street and met up with everybody else. A quick decision about our next destination and we were off for the  urlLink Lion Brewery  in Newmarket. Nothing like a brewery tour to take the edge off. Unfortunately the 1500 tour was booked solid, but we managed to reserve a tour on Monday morning at a considerable discount. Plus I got a great picture with the first man to brew beer in New Zealand, Captain James Cook.  We polished off the day at  urlLink the Bog , their local pub in Parnell. It's an Irish pub, so I treated myself to a couple tasty  urlLink Guinness . We ate dinner at the Bog, and both Jordan and I couldn't finish our bangers and mash. The boys walked home through Alberon Preserve, and we all flopped down around the television to watch a DVD.  After the kids were in bed, I finished off  Flowers for Algernon  and started another book,  urlLink  Signal to Noise  . Then Teresa told me that the final of the  urlLink Rugby World Cup  was on. I went upstairs and watched  urlLink a thrilling game .    Sunday morning we ate a delicious breakfast and decided to make a day trip outside of Auckland. David wanted to take us out to  Waiheke Island , an island in the  urlLink Hauraki Gulf . Ferries depart every hour for  urlLink Waiheke  and take about 35-45 minutes. We left at 1100 and enjoyed a tasty Waiheke microbrew,  urlLink Baroona Beer , while in transit. We got some great views of an  urlLink enormous cruise ship  that docked during the night. It was immense - hell I saw it from the balcony of their house that morning. There was even a bit on the television news about its arrival in Auckland.  The ferry arrived at Waiheke a little before noon and we shuffled off in the rain. It was pretty apparent we were tourists, everyone else rapidly dispersed into waiting cars while David negotiated with a tour operator. The deal was struck for our tour, and it would start at 1300. The guy's name was Jaime and he dropped us in town for an hour and promised to pick us up.    We ate a bit of food at a restaurant and found Jaime waiting for us when we were finished. We got on board the big yellow bus and our tour started! He drove us around town for a bit, showed us the marae of the local Maori, some small harbors with their boat people sitting around, and then we hit the  urlLink Onetangi Road Vineyard  for our first wine tasting.   Apparently wineries are the new  urlLink big thing on Waiheke , and everybody is building tasting rooms and restaurants. Our host at Onetangi Road was a bloke by the name of Sam, and he explained how Waiheke is at the perfect latitude for making Bordeaux-style red wines, merlots, cabernet sauvignons and such. While Teresa and I sampled the wines David tried a beer sampler from the nearby Baroona Brewery. The wines were pretty good. The first couple tasted very young, almost like Beaujolais, and gradually they got more complex. The final wine, a 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot, was a real prize winner and definitely the best of the lot. In fact I purchased a bottle to take back home. It's sitting in my closet right now. I am taking Sam's advice and letting it age a bit before I pull the cork and guzzle it for a special occasion.  Onetangi Road was just the first vineyard that day. We proceeded directly to the next winery,  urlLink Te Motu  and sampled their vintages. If anything, Te Motu had better wines. If I had known we would be visiting so many wineries I probably wouldn't have bought the Onetangi Road bottle. As it was, I wasn't about to shell out the cash for another bottle of wine.  And so onto another vineyard. I don't even know the name of it. I was bored with this wine tasting crap, and so were the kids. While Teresa tasted a couple whites this place had available, David chatted up Jaime our guide. Basically the gist of their conversation was 'this is the last wine stop right?' Apparently Jaime had more in mind but he was willing to cut them out of the tour. Thank God.  We left the wineries behind and continued the tour to other sites; beaches, bays, harbors, resorts and stuff like that. With a little coaxing, Jaime left us off at an Irish Pub while he unloaded the two other tourists at the ferry. Molly Malone's was a fun little joint with a rousing open mike for musicians. Not a bad place actually.  The 1700 ferry was rapidly approaching, and we had to go. Jaime arrived and dropped us at the ferry pier, right next to a horse ranch. Sasha desperately wanted to ride a pony and she got a quick ride while the ferry was pulling up to dock.         We barely caught the ferry but soon we were on our way back to Auckland. It was misting outside, but a few people stood at the stern watching Waiheke fade into the distance. Far ahead of us Auckland loomed on the horizon, and that massive cruise ship was putting out to sea.  On Monday the kids had school all day and the adults had an appointment at the  urlLink Lion Brewery  in Newmarket. Turned out we were the only ones on the tour. Most of it was pretty silly, a multimedia presentation with animatronic dummies and slide shows showing the history and meaning of beer. I really found the last portion interesting. That's when we got to see the packaging floor and all the machinery. That was cool. And of course the final stop was a good one too. That's when we all got to pour a couple beers for ourselves (and purchase souvenirs).      That afternoon I got to see the university up close. We stopped at David's office to pick up some exams and look around for a bit. Looked like a college campus.  We had a barbecue that night and David invited a friend from the university over. Tesua arrived just as we sat down to eat and helped demolish the lamb spare ribs and steak. Afterwards we spent most of the evening out on the balcony, talking story and enjoying the night air. And that bottle of Jim Beam...          Tesua left late that night, after all the beer was gone and a sizable dent in the Jim Beam. Suffice to say we all slept late the next morning. But that will have to wait for another day.   End of Part One

       I caught the opening day for  urlLink Return of the King . The wait is over, it is a great movie. A vivid realization of Tolkien's world and the climactic battle between good and evil in Middle Earth. I read a  urlLink couple reviews  of  urlLink the movie  and decided to hazard the crowds. It was great. I only had a few minor quibbles with what was dropped, most notably Saruman's demise and the Battle of Hobbiton, but I understand why it happened. After the destruction of the ring and the passing of Sauron I could palpably feel the restlessness of the theater crowd. It is a 3 � hour movie after all - I understand that not everything in Tolkien's richly detailed story will translate to the screen.  Bottom line, this is an incredible movie and it does justice to the source material. Go see it this holiday season.

       What a day! Long and tiring. Still have a ton of shit to do around the house too. It seems like the holiday season has struck with a vengeance. Too much to do, and not enough time to sit down and relax. Parties to attend, presents to ship to family and friends, turkeys to fry (yes, I got a turkey freer - and it's in hot demand right now), and tomorrow I start covering for the other system analyst while he's on vacation for four weeks. Never mind my own projects at work and stuff to do around the house.  One bit of good news came through this week: next year we get an additional holiday. Starting in 2004, the company will add Martin Luther King's birthday into our holiday schedule. And they aren't taking away one of our old holidays either! I think that gives up 10 paid holidays next year. That's almost like being a banker, except we don't close at 3:00 pm every day.  Got to get up early tomorrow and fry a couple turkeys before work. It's our company holiday luncheon and I offered up my services in making a turkey. This one hour luncheon is all we get as employees, and it's pot luck to boot. The company Christmas party went the way of the dodo about five years ago.  Not that I miss it much; in 1997 Typhoon packs hit the weekend our Christmas party was scheduled. The party was postponed until February, then senior management realized it was much cheaper to rent a hotel ballroom in February after the holiday season so for the next two years our Christmas party was about two weeks before Valentine's Day. And they still called it a Christmas party. Go figure.  Anyway 1999, well actually February 2000, was the last company party - new the new senior management killed that off with the new millennium.

       The PDN ran a  urlLink good background article  on the history of the polluted waters off Orote Point and the continuing ban on eating fish from the area.

I don't doubt those claims, the waters off Guam are not exactly abundant in fish after years of extensive harvesting.

This isn't a little drip, it was a fucking cascade coming through the tiles this morning when I arrived. We're just lucky no computers have been damaged by this continuing problem up here.

And I just arrived at 'Bring out the Gimp' and the Revels playing Comanche. Sweet Jesus, I'd forgot all about that little episode in the movie. That scene was the final straw for me: Tarantino went off the deep end with that scene. The Gimp, the wild sax music, Bruce Willis selecting the samurai sword, and Ving Rhames' timeless promise "to get medieval on yo' ass." I was laughing hysterically in the theater the first time I saw that scene, the rest of the audience probably thought I was insane or something.  Did I mention how NOISY it is in the office today?

       From Roland Piquepaille's Technology Trends weblog:  urlLink NASA's Satellites Watch World's Cities Grow . The  urlLink original article  at NASA documents the growth of urban areas over ten years.  urlLink Geographers  used  urlLink satellite imagery  to compare the size of cities after 10 year intervals. Urbanization increased at an alarming rate in every case, with some cities growing 25% in just ten years. This urban sprawl is not limited to North American cities, cities in China and India exhibited the same growth patterns of development clustered around major arteries leading out of the cities.   Speaking of sprawl, I found a couple web pages by James Howard Kunstler,  author of  urlLink  The Geography of Nowhere   and a major critic of sprawl and it's associated architecture. I found the  urlLink Eyesore of the Month  entertaining, but his scathing piece on the modern American landscape struck a chord with me.  urlLink Home From Nowhere  lays out price Americans pay for the ubitquitous automobile, a dead, sparsely populated landscape peppered with parking lots, freeways, fried food ghettos and warehouse shopping boxes without a single window in the edifice. A soulless and bankrupt urban landscape, the antithesis of our popular conception of American small town values, Main Street, public parks, apple pie and kids playing baseball in the street. Such a vision is increasingly a fantasy, replaced by Wal-Mart supercenters with five acres of parking and multi-lane freeways to move all those people  and their merchandise  around in cars.

       I just won't shut up about global warming. A recent article in Salon points out the high cost of shipping food around the world instead of eating local produce:  urlLink Global Trade = Global Warming .  Researchers at Iowa State University have found that fruits and vegetables travel an average of 1,500 miles within the U.S., a 22 percent increase since 1981... Studies show that a basic diet with imported ingredients can easily consume four times the fossil-fuel energy and emit four times the carbon dioxide compared to domestically produced ingredients.  Almost all the food on Guam is imported, with only a few vegetables, fruits and meats produced on island. I can only imagine how much is cost to transport stuff across the ocean.

       I just can't get enough of global warming lately. Bill McKibben wrought a   urlLink poignant piece  in Granta about the world's blithe disregard for global warming and the coming catastrophe of our own making. Perhaps we lack the vision or the will to address this problem, maybe we fiddle while Rome burns, I don't know. I suspect people just avoid the problem entirely and hope it will somehow sort itself out.  Global warming is a scary and difficult thing to address, and many people are markedly ignorant about it. I bought a new car earlier this year, a small, fuel-efficient compact car. People that knew me were astounded. I had probably 10 people tell me that I needed a big V-8 pickup, something like a Dodge Ram, Ford F-350 or one of those land-yacht SUV's like the Ford Expedition. No real explanation was given for why I needed such an immense vehicle. When I asked why they needed such large vehicles to drive 10 miles to work every day I got the usual answers: 'I need to drive my kids around,' 'It makes me feel safe,' 'It fits my lifestyle,' 'I got a nice tax break by buying it,' and 'Huh?' I got blank stares when I explained I wanted a small, fuel efficient vehicle. Nobody cares. I think most people are just slowly being boiled alive while the heat is turned up and they never even notice it's their hand on the thermostat.  Hat tip for the McKibben article:  urlLink How to Save the World

       The Japanese Space Exploration Agency  urlLink announced the abandonment  of the Nozumi Mars probe this week, after five years of  urlLink circuitous ramblings  through the solar system to arrive at the red planet. The unfortunate probe, originally launched in 1998, met with a series of setbacks that delayed the approach to Mars. A  urlLink solar flare  mortally wounded the craft, short-circuiting critical systems that could not be repaired remotely. Instead of orbiting red planet (or  urlLink colliding  during closest approach), the probe will be deliberately sent into deep space to avoid contaminating the Martian environment.  It's been a string of setbacks for Japan lately, including the  urlLink destruction of two spy satellites  last month when their rocket launch went awry.

       A tragedy was averted yesterday when  urlLink 5 paddlers were rescued  from tumultuous seas just outside the Hag�t�a Boat Basin.

The ocean is nothing to fuck around with. I've known too many people who drowned or were lost at sea, including a similar situation with paddlers losing their canoe in high seas. If you go out over the reef in a canoe, take PFD's for Christ's sake. Especially if you go out in the locally produced canoes; those things were designed for flat water inside the reef, not open ocean swells.

The PDN  urlLink diligently published  the  urlLink stories  of many  urlLink survivors , detailing the abuse and horrors they suffered under the Japanese.  I don't know if anything will come of these hearings, but I certainly hope so. While Guam was given a chance to claim recompensation shortly after the war, times were difficult back then and many people were not aware of their rights or lacked the chance to properly file for damages. I hope this commission holds the Japanese government accountable for the atrocities committed 60 years ago and provides compensation for those harmed by the occupation.

       The strangest thing happened today. I was having this discussion with Erwin a little before noon. Nothing uncommon in this, we are cubicle neighbors and collaborate throughout the day. Today's conversation was about how I was exposed to so much recycling when I was in New Zealand and Australia. On Guam nobody recycles; there is no waste disposal/recycling program, so all the trash goes into the Ordot Dump. It is simply to expensive to recycle glass, metal, paper and plastic on island, or at least that is the excuse given to the public. But in New Zealand, all the trash was broken down - bottles, paper, plastic, metal - everything was part of a recycling effort. A far cry from our dirty little island.  Then I mentioned that some recycling exists on Guam. The stalled incinerator project calls for a waste management policy that includes recycling, and there is that tire recycling company in Barrigada.  "You mean that one that  urlLink caught on fire a few months ago ?" Erwin asked.  "Yeah," I replied and turned to look out the window. "Fuck me! Look,  urlLink it's on fire again !"  Sure enough, thick black clouds were rising from behind the airport, towards Barrigada. I took a photo at about 13:00, after I returned from lunch. By then the fire crews were trying to contain the fire, so the huge black cloud was more gray from the dousing. Still it looks impressive.       I swear, it happened exactly like that. I guess we jinxed the place. I can't imagine they will stay open now. This is their second massive fire in under 5 months.

        urlLink Wired 11.12: The Second Coming of Philip K. Dick  is an excellent piece about the surge in popularity being enjoyed by Philip Dick, over two decades after his death. His vision of reality and the future is prevalent in Hollywood:  Blade Runner ,  Minority Report ,  The Matrix  movies,  Memento ,  The Truman Show ,  The Thirteenth Floor ,  Dark City , the list goes on and on. His ideas permeate creative thought these days. What is reality, what is perception, how do we tell the difference?   "Dick gives us a vision of the future that captures the feel of our time. He didn't really care about robots or space travel, though they sometimes turn up in his stories. He wrote about ordinary Joes caught in a web of corporate domination and ubiquitous electronic media, of memory implants and mood dispensers and counterfeit worlds." --- "Like the babbling psychics who predict future crimes in  Minority Report , Dick was a precog. Lurking within his amphetamine-fueled fictions are truths that have only to be found and decoded. In a 1978 essay he wrote: 'We live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political groups. I ask, in my writing, What is real? Because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudorealities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms. I do not distrust their motives. I distrust their power. It is an astonishing power: that of creating whole universes, universes of the mind. I ought to know. I do the same thing.'"

       Interesting. The computer that powers most space probes, including  urlLink both Mars Rovers , is the  urlLink RAD6000 . It is a variant of the old PPC 601 chips that ran in the first PowerMacs ten years ago.  The RAD6000 is a proven and capable chip, but compared to the chips in modern PC's it is positively Paleolithic. It tops out at 25 mHz, yeah I said megahertz. But a new generation chip is just becoming available, the  urlLink RAD750 . The  urlLink RAD750  is based on the  urlLink PowerPC 750 , the same chip that runs this Macintosh I am sitting at right now. Apple calls it the  urlLink G3 , and still uses the chip in some low end notebooks. While the RAD750 runs at a pokey 250 mHz, that's still a tenfold increase in processing capability of the RAD6000. And believe me, my  urlLink 300 mHz G3  is plenty fast for most everything I need. I wonder if the next NASA probe will play mp3's?

       Well one thing about living here on Guam: I am increasingly anal about filing my taxes earlier than everyone else. It's not even the end of January and  urlLink tax-filing season is already under way . I downloaded  urlLink the forms from the IRS  website yesterday, and I hope to prepare them tonight. That'll be a new record for me. I usually file in mid-February, but that doesn't even seem to get me a refund any sooner. And yes, I already changed my withholding for this year so I don't have to worry about this again.

       The PDN  urlLink broke a bombshell  this morning when they picked up  urlLink a story that aired on Dateline NBC  this weekend. An exposé on the  urlLink sordid world  of Southeast Asia's child sex market turns up a surprising number of American "tourists" engaging in pedophilia with small children. In fact they caught  urlLink one American doctor  on videotape explaining the process and places to go to an undercover reporter. And where was this doctor from? That's right - Guam. Granted he was only here for a short contract, filling in for a local radiologist, but this kind of behavior is  urlLink far from uncommon  on  urlLink the island . There is a whole subculture on the island that lives here because of the close proximity to Southeast Asia and the opportunities our location offers for sex tourism, especially with young women.  urlLink Larry Hillblom , founder and owner of DHL courier service and a longtime resident of Saipan,  urlLink was notorious  for his  urlLink sexual adventures . Frankly this latest bottom feeder Dateline NBC caught on tape seems like small potatoes compared to some of the other pederasts that inhabit Micronesia.

       Another unexpected outcome of global warming; Europe could freeze over in a matter of decades.  urlLink Global warming could plunge Britain into new ice age within decades , claims research. Seems that the heating of tropical waters by global warming could cause the Gulf Stream to collapse, ending the warm and temperate climate Europe enjoys. Once that happens, Western Europe could quickly come to resemble Labrador, a frosty, treeless tundra with long bitter winters.  It's a good thing George W. Bush told us that global warming doesn't exist. For a moment there I was almost tempted to believe trained scientists who have spent a lifetime studying this so called phenomenon. I bet they feel pretty silly now.

        urlLink Annan calls for development push  according to the BBC, and he wants to get business involved. "Business... has a powerful interest in helping to prevent the international security system from sliding back into brute competition based on the laws of the jungle," he told the Davos forum.  But he also tossed in a jab at making trade fair for most of the developing world. Part of the problem, he said, was "dwindling investment in those parts of the world where it is most needed, and trade talks which have left in place "egregious biases against developing countries".   urlLink Aljazeera echoes  that sentiment, they also stress the anxiety the UN chief feels about the current global political climate:  Annan's speech reflected continuing concern over fallout from the Iraq war and the aggressive posture adopted by the United States since the September 11, 2001 attacks.  He said the prevailing economic, security and diplomatic climate had "become far less favourable to the maintenance of a stable, equitable and rule-based global order."  If global terrorism threatens peace and can heighten communal tensions,  "the war against terrorism can sometimes aggravate those tensions, as well as raising concerns about the protection of human rights and civil liberties."  The United Nations and the system of collective security are under "severe strain," Annan said.   "In just a few short years, the prevailing atmosphere has shifted from belief in the near-inevitability of globalisation to deep uncertainty about the very survival of our tenuous global order."  Perhaps some people realize that violence only begets more violence.  I read a fascinating article last night in a back issue of  urlLink Utne Reader . Amory Lovins, co-founder of the  urlLink Rocky Mountain Institute  gave a speech two years ago about fostering  urlLink Genuine National Security . He states that a modern, open, free society cannot effectively guard itself against terrorism. There are too many vulnerable points; water supplies, wastewater treatment plants, telecommunications, power and financial infrastructures, and interdependent transportation systems. Crippling any of these widely dispersed grids could render large urban areas uninhabitable.  Instead of locking down the free society and changing it into a police state, Lovins suggests focusing instead on the 'tripolar society' that now dominates geopolitics.   The new world order consists of governments, global corporations, and civil society. Approaching national security issues based on the outmoded assumption that governments are the axis of power in the is he says, 'dangerously incomplete and obsolete.'  Prevention is the only lasting and effective defense against the hatred that fuels anti-American terrorism, Lovins adds. It's the only strategy that requires no threat of violence and; and it's the only one that actually saves taxpayer dollars.  The crux of Lovins' approach is the belief that a world without hunger and poverty is a safer world. The UN estimates that the cost providing clean water, sanitation, basic health care, nutrition and education to every person on earth is $40 billion a year. That's less than a tenth of the United States' defense budget and less than half of what has already been appropriated for Iraq reconstruction. "Such a modest investment - applied to nations equitably and without political strings attached - would go a long way toward calming social and political unrest throughout the world, and toward mending America's battered reputation."  But let's face it, this is a pipe dream. It will happen when pigs fly. Creating true, lasting, positive change in the world is a difficult and thankless business. It is a lot easier to blow shit up with billions of dollars of high explosives and technology. Not only does it take care of recalcitrant dictators, but the global corporations that promoted the attack can reap the benefit of lucrative restoration contracts in the aftermath. Plus violence has the added benefit of cowing the more restive populations in the world with the threat of fire and bombs falling from the sky. Or at least that is what Bush and Cheney and their buddies at Bechtel and Halliburton would have us believe.  So why do I hear a voice in my head saying  urlLink "Those who live by the sword, shall die by the sword."  Perhaps because the cycle of violence is so hard to break. One look at the horrible mess in Israel and Palestine should provide ample evidence of that. The creed that blood demands blood leaves everyone mortally wounded. Someone has to step back from the edge and say "No more violence."  Of course those words about living and dying by the sword came from a noted radical that was executed by the authorities for promoting his simple idea:  urlLink "Love your neighbor as you love yourself."

       I had a momentary thrill this evening. I retrieved my mail from the post office box and I discovered an envelope from the Guam Department of Revenue and Taxation. Oh my god - my 2002 tax refund, a year late! I breathlessly opend the envelope and discovered... a W-2 form from Rev & Tax stating the interest I've earned on the tax refund they have yet to disburse to me. You know, so I can put it on my 2003 tax return.  Ugh. I wish the government had money to pay out the tax refunds. It sucks that they feel the need to take my money, then refuse to give me back what is rightfully mine. And whenever some loose funds appear in the government coffers, they are promptly distributed to government retirees.

        urlLink Explosion causes outage . Power was restored in Yona when I got home last night. Seems a breaker blew up in Mongmong causing the entire island-wide grid to go down. Kudos to GPA for restoring power quickly. It's a far cry from the days of rolling blackouts because the island didn't have enough generating capacity. Power outages have become uncommon - not rare, but uncommon. Still a great deal better than the daily occurrence they used to be.

        Though I enjoy nearly 180º of ocean view from my cliffline home, I rarely see a ship at sea. The port is on the other side of the island and large vessels rarely pass along the eastern side of Guam. So I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of this vessel in the misty rain yesterday afternoon, about 3 kilometers off shore. The clouds obscured the ship and at first I wasn't sure it lay out there, but when I got my binoculars I was sure. My zoom on the digital camera wasn't sufficient to get a good photo, so I butted the binoculars next to the camera lens and used that as poor man's telephoto zoom. I think the results aren't half bad. Takes a steady hand though. Dianne mentioned that she saw a warship off the coast on Sunday, I wonder what the reason for this sudden plethora of ships off Yona means.

       Well that didn't take long did it? NASA announced  urlLink the cancellation of all future repair and maintenance missions to the Hubble Space Telescope  on Friday, dooming the telescope after 14 years in orbit. President Bush declared that all resources now be focused on a moonbase, including the space shuttle and space station. All future space shuttle missions will focus on completing construction of the space station. The space shuttles will be retired by 2010, leaving barely enough time to haul the remaining pieces of the station into orbit.  Regrettably this means that all shuttle missions not associated with the station are cancelled, including  urlLink this year's maintenance and upgrade mission  to the aging space telescope. Without replacement gyroscopes and batteries, the space telescope will probably become useless in 2007 or 2008, ending one of NASA's most spectacularly successful projects. Guess that's what happens when the president decides he wants  urlLink a moonbase to help in the conquest of Mars  but doesn't feel like increasing NASA's budget. Didn't JFK double NASA's budget when he declared the nation's goal of putting a man on the moon?

       Another local doctor has plead guilty to illegally distributing prescription pain killers. Dr. Vincent Duenas  urlLink  plead guilty  in November but the case was unsealed yesterday. Court documents state that Duenas supplied oxycodone hydrochloride - Percocet - to one individual from April 2000 to October 2002. Federal authorities did not reveal the identity of the recipient of the narcotics, but documents state that Duenas supplied him with the drug knowing that he was probably addicted to the pain killers.  Dr. Duenas isn't the only physician busted in the last year for prescribing pain medication. Dr. Davina Lujan and Dr. Vivien Batoyon Sagisi both plead guilty in last year to conspiracy to illegally distribute the pain killer.  Here are the terms of the plea agreement Duenas entered in November:   THE PLEA AGREEMENT    Dr. Vincent A. Duenas has agreed to cooperate fully with the U.S. The defendant understands and agrees that complete and truthful cooperation is a material condition of this agreement.  He agreed to take no steps directly or indirectly to "tip" or warn any subject of this investigation that the defendant, a subject, or anyone else is being investigated.  If Duenas' plea is ever rejected, withdrawn, vacated, or reversed at any time, the U.S. will be free to prosecute Duenas "for all charges of which it then has knowledge, and any charges that have been dismissed will be automatically reinstated or may be represented to a grand jury with jurisdiction over the matter," court documents state.  He agreed to voluntarily surrender his Drug Enforcement Administration registration at sentencing. The United States agrees to make known the nature and extent of defendant's cooperation to those responsible for determining any later application for reinstatement of defendant's DEA registration.  Duenas understands that he may be subject to administrative action by state and territorial agencies as a result of his guilty plea entered pursuant to this agreement.  Duenas also understands and agrees that the status of any professional license held by him is not protected by the plea agreement and is "a matter solely within the discretion" of the appropriate licensing authority.   Plea agreement, U.S. District Court of Guam    PENALTY    The maximum penalty for the offense is imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of $1 million, a term of supervised release to be determined by the court, and a special assessment in the amount of $100.   OTHER PLEA AGREEMENTS    Former Guam Memorial Hospital Administrator Dr. Davina Lujan pleaded guilty, in a Nov. 13, 2002, plea agreement, to conspiracy to illegally distribute the pain killer Percocet. She wrote prescriptions for Percocet without conducting physical exams on the person for whom she prescribed it, and knew the pain killer was to be delivered to a third party. Lujan was appointed GMH administrator by former Gov. Carl Gutierrez after he disbanded the hospital board.  Under a plea agreement, Dr. Vivien Batoyon Sagisi pleaded guilty in March last year to conspiracy to distribute the drug Percocet. On different occasions in 2002, Sagisi wrote prescriptions for Percocet without conducting physical examinations on the person for whom she prescribed it. She also knew the pain killer was to be delivered to a third party. One person for whom a prescription was written was Antonina M. Palomo, according to Sagisi's plea agreement. Palomo, also known as Toni Cross, was a special assistant to former Gov. Carl Gutierrez and was earning $70,000 a year, according to the governor's office fiscal 2002 staffing pattern. Sagisi knew Palomo was to deliver the pain killer to other people, the plea agreement said.   The identity of the recipient of the Percocet was not disclosed. It's probably the worst kept secret on Guam though. Let me just say there are plenty of rumors about a certain person's history of drug problems, both on and off island.   I was surprised to learn how prevalent the use of pain killers is on Guam. I spent a large part of this past week in discussions with pharmacists and the topic came up several times. They talked about whole families addicted to pain killers and how difficult it was to detect and stop the abuse. Perhaps the recent admission by Rush Limbaugh about his dependency on pain killers will prompt more frank and open discussion about drug policy in the nation.

       So we are going to  urlLink the moon  and then to Mars? Great, another colossal sinkhole for taxpayer money.  Don't get me wrong, I think space exploration is  urlLink a worthy and noble goal . But  urlLink unmanned probes do a great job  at far less cost than lofting human astronauts into the great beyond. Let's just face facts; outer space is a nasty place, inimical to human life. To keep our frail bodies alive in space requires massive amounts of shielding and storage for food, water and air. But robots excel at such dangerous  missions and require no food, water or air and far less radiation shielding. And if the robot probe is destroyed it is regrettable, but no human lives are lost in a foolhardy endeavors.  And perhaps we should get our own house in order before we start despoiling alien worlds with our pollution and trash. So many things are wrong with our planet right now, I'd rather focus the money and energy on resolving those  minor problems  like overpopulation, starvation, poverty, AIDS, global warming, deforestation, mass extinction of species, pollution and the threat of nuclear annihilation. These are all tough, unglamorous problems, but if we get our ducks in a row here on Earth, then lets go to the moon. Until then, let's keep tossing up these affordable robot probes to explore the far reaches of our solar system. There's no hurry, the universe isn't going anywhere soon. It will still be there when we are ready to leave our planetary confines.

        urlLink Recycling laws to go into effect next year - guampdn.com   Apparently a pair of laws signed last year will be put into effect in 2005. The first mandates a village based recycling program managed by mayors and the second establishes a disposal fee on automobiles and white goods (washers, dryers, etc.). Of course, none of the mayors discussed the new law or how to implement it, but I hope something positive comes from this. Guam needed a recycling program ten years ago.

        urlLink Shell fuel prices rise 7 cents per gallon - guampdn.com : during my morning commute, I scoped out the prices at all the gas stations between my house and home    Shell  - $2.149 for regular unleaded, $2.249 for premium   76  - $2.099 for regular unleaded, $2.149 for premium   Mobil  - $2.119 for regular unleaded, $2.239 for premium  I'll bet dollars to doughnuts that all the island's gas stations match Shell's prices by the end of the day.  It might be time to start biking to work again, or maybe riding the bus. I'm just glad I don't drive a gas-guzzling SUV.

       Found  urlLink a link  to this incredible essay published last year in the Atlantic:  urlLink A Space in Time , by  urlLink Michael Benson . It is an amazing look at the quantity and quality of astronomical information available on the internet, most of it beamed back to earth by intrepid robot explorers. I've never read a finer paean to the possibilities of both the internet and NASA's unmanned probes. Makes me wonder why we keep spending billions on the space shuttle and space station, our meager toehold claim to a manned space program. Our probes are far less expensive and capable of doing incredible science among worlds untouched by man.

       An insightful guide to  urlLink Bum Wines . Who'd have guessed Night Train and Thunderbird are the product of  urlLink Ernest and Julio Gallo ? That's a little bit of history I never heard before.   The history of Thunderbird is as interesting as the drunken effects the one experiences from the wine.  When Prohibition ended, Ernest Gallo and his brothers Julio and Joe wanted to corner the young wine market.  Earnest wanted the company to become "the Campbell Soup company of the wine industry" so he started selling Thunderbird in the ghettos around the country.  Their radio adds featured a song that sang, "What's the word? / Thunderbird / How's it sold? / Good and cold / What's the jive? / Bird's alive / What's the price? / Thirty twice."  It is said that Ernest once drove through a tough, inner city neighborhood and pulled over when he saw a bum.  When Gallo rolled down his window and called out, "What's the word?" the immediate answer from the bum was, "Thunderbird."

        Sounds like we are on the cusp of a major breakthrough in deep sea exploration. Submersible ROV's ( R emotely  O perated  V ehicle) are becoming more capable and powerful, and a new class of underwater submersibles is emerging, HROV's ( H ybrid  R emotely  O perated  V ehicle), capable of independent exploration without the use of cumbersome tethers.   urlLink BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Next-generation robots take the plunge   Perhaps a new exploration of the  urlLink Marianas Trench , just offshore of Guam is in order. The Marianas Trench is one of the most activity earthquakes zones on the planet, as the Pacific Plate slips beneath the Philippine Plate. The Challenger Deep is the deepest point in all the world's oceans. In fact, if Mt. Everest were placed in the Marianas Trench, the summit of the mountain would still be two kilometers beneath the waves. That's pretty damn deep.

       I have one final installment from my trip back in November. I'll be quick and just post up the pictures.   Friday November 28  I arrived in Cairns at noon. The sun was shining and the heat was a pleasant reminder of my tropical home. No offense, but Auckland was pretty damn chilly. All those years in the tropics have thinned my blood.  I grabbed a taxi for the 10 minute ride to the Esplanade, the center of Cairns. I checked back into the  urlLink Bellview , and I actually got the same room again, so I was familiar with all the accoutrements. The flight from Auckland was a long one, and I read a sizable portion of  urlLink  Signal to Noise  , so I just flopped in my room and started reading intently. After the hectic schedule of the last few days, it was a pleasure to sit by myself and lose myself in a good book.  I finished the novel around 20:00 that evening and went searching for something to do. I stopped for dinner at a place about a hundred meters down the Esplanade,  urlLink Rattle & Hum . I'll admit I was a little confused at first, the waitress never bothered to take my order. When I finally asked, I was schooled in how it is done. In a nod to fast food enterprises, the restaurants makes patrons order from the counter and pick up their own meals when the food is ready. I guess that cuts down on staff or something, but I was confused at the time.  After eating and several Guinness, I took a walk. Here's a shot of central Cairns from the marina where all the Great Reef tour boats depart during the day.      I was pretty tired by 22:00 (that was 01:00 in Auckland after all), so I walked back to my room and got ready for bed. I pulled out another book,  urlLink  Foucault's Pendulum  , and read for about a half hour. Then I was asleep.   Saturday, November 29  Woke up early and got a good look at Cairns in the early morning. I spent a good part of the morning by the public swimming pool just outside of the Bellview. Truth be told, I was busy transcribing the previous week's adventures so I wouldn't forget all the details.      Around 11:00 I found an internet cafe and checked my email. Then I visited the  urlLink Cairns Regional Gallery  and looked at a couple exhibits. It was a small museum, but I enjoyed myself. One exhibit was local photographers taking pictures of sumptuous meals served on beautiful hand-made ceramics. The photo of the meal and the actual plate it was served on were exhibited. Interesting idea, gave me a sense of connection with the photos of food. Unfortunately no photography was allowed in the museum.  I grabbed lunch at  urlLink Oasis Kebab , next to the Bellview. Those kebabs are damn tasty, certainly something I miss back here on Guam. They are onolicious, and really good late at night. After eating lunch, I spent some time walking through town, but ending up taking a long nap that afternoon.  When I got up at 17:00, I wrote for a bit then went to  urlLink PJ O'Brien's , an Irish pub a few blocks away. I started downing Guinness in large quantities and ordered up the bangers and mash. I washed down all that food with more Guinness and polished off dinner with a snootful (or two) of Johnny Walker.  I was pretty tight when I left that place around 21:00, but I managed to enjoy some music in another club and a free outdoor concert. But another beer put the fork in me, and I was done. I stumbled off to the Bellview and sleep.   Sunday, November 30  I woke around 3:30. It was raining. A hard and fast downpour. I listened to the rain and thought about how the locals needed rain so bad. The entire area was parched and brown. 2002 had been a drought year, and 2003 was just as bad. So I figured this rain was a welcome blessing.  It lasted about a half hour, then petered out. I lay in bed thinking about what I wanted to do. Around 4:30 I could hear a band of drunken revelers outside by the pool. Belly flops and loud laughing commenced, at least for a few minutes. Then Rod Mieklejohn came back from the front desk and yelled at the drunken idiots.  After the commotion died down, I roused myself and went to eat breakfast at McDonald's Not much else was open at 5:30 in the morning. I ate out by the swimming pool on the Esplanade, and enjoyed watching the sunrise.  It was my last day on vacation and I wanted to do something memorable. When I came back to the Bellview, Rodney was setting out a board with the day's featured activity. It was a trip to a nearby village, Kuranda. It sounded like fun, and Rodney made all the arrangements for me. I just had to show up at a nearby restaurant at 10:30 and the tour would begin. We made a couple stops enroute to pick up other people going on the tour. The last stop was at a condo unit adjacent to Cairns' oldest cemetery.       urlLink Kuranda  lies about 20 kilometers inland, along the Barron River, at the start of the Atherton Tableland. It is a popular destination for day tours from Cairns. The village is full of things to do, mostly centered on the rainforest experience. The town lies in the Barron Gorge National Park, a fantastic treasure. The main attraction of the park are the colossal Barron Falls at the head of the gorge, just outside of Kuranda. While it is possible to drive there, most people take either the historic  urlLink Kuranda Railway  or the newer SkyRail, one of Queensland's most popular attractions.  My tour began at the SkyRail terminal at the base of the coastal range, about 7 kilometers north of Cairns.  urlLink The SkyRail  was a cable car attraction that ran for over 7 kilometers to Kuranda. It was incredible. The views afforded by the cable car, looking down into the jungle canopy, were amazing. I took a ton of pictures, but I will only post a few up here.      The SkyRail included a couple stops during the cable car ride. The first was at Red Peak Station, the highest point of the journey. Red Peak Station included a nature walk through the rainforest, a fascinating look at the jungle plants and animals.            After leaving Red Peak Station the cable cars descended a bit and I caught my first views of the Barron Gorge.            The second stop was at the top of the Barron Falls. The falls were a mere shadow of their usual force because of the prolonged drought, but I was still impressed. Even in their diminished state, the falls were still ten time larger and higher than any waterfall on Guam.      Kuranda was just beyond the waterfall and I got into the village just after noon. I had three hours until the train left for Cairns, so I got busy looking around. Kuranda was a small town, full of shops and attractions. I bought a few things, then relaxed with a beer before deciding to visit  urlLink Birdworld , a large aviary that advertised a stunning collection of birds. Coming from an island were all the birds went extinct two decades ago, I have a deep longing to see and hear birds. So I went to check it out. And I really wanted to see a  urlLink cassowary , a large bird indigenous to that part of Queensland.            After my adventure at Birdworld - believe me, dodging all that bird poop is an adventure - I stopped for a burger and a couple beers at the  urlLink Rainforest View Restaurant . It was pretty good, and it offered a nice view of the SkyRail topping the ridge across the Barron River and heading into town. After eating, I felt like a walk. The people at the restaurant directed me towards a short jungle walk that lead away from the village and along  urlLink Jumrum Creek .      Time was running short, so I headed towards the train station. I made to the railroad with just a few minutes to spare. Lucky I had a seat reserved. The  urlLink Kuranda Scenic Railway  train was incredible, with original all wood cars carefully restored and the specially painted engines. The train took longer to reach Cairns, but the views were incredible. The train even stopped at Barron Falls, so I got another look at the cataracts.                  One very nice thing about the train; it ends right in the middle of Cairns. No bus rides back into town. The train arrived at a little after 17:00. I check my email at the same internet cafe, then went looking for someplace to eat. I chose the  urlLink Raw Prawn Cafe , near the Bellview. I feasted on some oysters and a tuna steak. Very good, but a little pricey.  My flight to Guam wasn't until 01:00, so I had plenty of time to kill. I packed everything up, then went down the street to Rattle & Hum to see how many Guinness I could consume before I needed to get to the airport. I think I stayed until about 11:30 and chatted up the bartender. On the way back to the Bellview, I stopped for one final kebab at Oasis Kebab.      And then I was gone off to the airport. It was a whirlwind trip, but I had a blast. I only wish it was longer.

       So the headlines for the last couple days revolved around GovGuam's  urlLink problems scheduling school bus routes . Seems the big problem here is that there aren't enough buses to effectively route all the public school kids. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that well over a dozen private schools get free public school bus service for their students.  This just burns me up and people I mention it to don't seem to understand. They always say parents with kids in private school pay taxes, so they are entitled to free bussing and textbooks supplied by GovGuam. Uh no, those funds should go to the public schools. If parents make the decision to put their children into private school, they are making the decision to fund their children's education privately.  urlLink Today's editorial  in the PDN makes a good point. Just because private school parents pay taxes doesn't give them the right to demand public service for their decisions. I don't have any kids, yet my tax dollars fund the school system. I demand that my tax dollars  not  go into education, but rather something that benefits me. But I don't get to pick and choose how my taxes are spent, and neither should these people that chose to pull their children out of the public school system.

       The road construction going on just outside my house was scheduled for completion last November. Now officials are saying  urlLink mid-February is the new target date . Yeah, and monkeys will fly out of my ass. They won't be done with this project until July is my prediction. They need to spend months and months digging holes and filling them back in on the other side of the highway. Then they'll pave the southbound lanes and we'll have this bisected highway with road construction on the old portion in the middle for another year.

       I watched  urlLink  The Seventh Seal   last night for the first time in probably ten years. I was very impressed. The DVD was digitally scrubbed to remove scratches and blemishes on the film and light levels were readjusted. I remember the first time I saw Bergman's masterpiece in college, it was dark and grainy and altogether unenjoyable. What a transformation. The film is an incredible piece of work, a somber reflection on death and the meaning of life. Each character represents some archetype of humanity; the devout mute girl, libidinous Lisa and her slow witted husband Plog, the vain actor Skat, the vile seminarian Raval, and the simple 'holy family' of Jof, Mia and Michael. The most realized characters in the movie the ascetic, searching knight Antonius Block, and his agnostic squire Jöns. The knight is deeply troubled by the horrors he saw in the Crusades, and questions the existence of God, the pain that is life, and the purpose of man. His questioning nature is paired off against his worldly, agnostic squire, who expresses belief in nothing except women, wine and song. These two comrades travel a land where Death walks amongst the people for  urlLink the Plague  is ravaging the land. Both defiantly human until the end, striving against Death and the despair that surrounds them. It's a great film, and rightly so. This cleaned up DVD really enhances the experience.

       Reading the newly submitted stories on  urlLink Kuro5hin  this morning, I came across a fascinating article about the political and cultural divides within the United States.  urlLink Beyond Red and Blue  is primarily concerned with the upcoming 2004 presidential election, but I found  urlLink the descriptions  of the 10 different regions the most interesting. It reminded me of a book I read ages ago,  urlLink  The Nine Nations of North America  , by Joel Garreau.  Both the book and this article divvy up the country into  urlLink disparate regions , The Northeast urban sector, Mexamerica, Ecotopia in the Pacific Northwest, the farmlands of the Breadbasket, the Rust Belt's aging industrial regions, the changing face of the South, and the unabashed extraction economy of the far west. He nailed it pretty good and the book has actually weather the test of time quite well. It is over 20 years old, but it still rings true.  I am certain Garreau's ideas were on the mind of Robert David Sullivan as he wrote Beyond Red & Blue, but Sullivan refined the general divisions of the earlier book. The distinct regions are actually broken down by county voting results since 1976. The final analysis is a thoughtful piece of work, indicating where both Democrats and Republicans need to focus their efforts in order to carry the 2004 election.

       Well, it is 2004 here on Guam. Last night was pretty low key, a few beers here in the neighborhood and in bed by 12:30. I was definitely inside at midnight, when the live fire zone started. Pistols, shotguns, machine guns and a neighbor with a home-made cannon kept up a racket for a couple hours after midnight. It was a shame too, because it was a clear sparkling night outside, but I was afraid I was going to catch a bullet (several people are hit by stray bullets every New Year's Eve on Guam). Best to stay inside and relax while the idiots get their rocks off.  Anyway, best wishes for a safe and happy 2004!

       While I'm at it, let's post up a couple snake pictures. Several brown tree snakes showed up several times this week, no doubt attracted by the smell of blood and puppies in the house. This one arrived on Thursday night.     This fellow was wrapped around the shower curtain pole in the bathroom where the puppies sleep. Nothing a broomstick and a scuba tank can't fix though.     A word to the wise: Don't get between these females and their pups!

       Federal officials removed two Guam species from  urlLink the endangered species list  this week. The Guam Mallard (or  Nganga ) and the Guam Broadbill (or  chiguanguan ) are now  urlLink deemed extinct .  The nganga, a duck that lived in wetlands in both Guam and the CNMI was never very numerous. Added to the endangered species list in 1977, the last mallard seen on Guam was in 1967, and the last confirmed sighting in Saipan occurred in 1979. Scientists suspect the loss of the mallard's habitat caused the nganga's extinction.  The Guam broadbill was a small flycatcher endemic to Guam. It was last seen in the wild in 1984, the same year it was listed as an endangered species. The likely cause of extinction is the brown tree snake.  When it became apparent both species were threatened in the wild, scientists unsuccessfully attempted  urlLink captive breeding programs . The only nganga's captured were three old birds that never mated, and the brown tree snake ate all the female chiguanguan by the time scientists began capturing the birds. They only caught males, which makes sense since the females sat on the nest and fell victim to predation.  A third species, the bridled white-eye is expected to join the mallard and the broadbill on the rolls of extinct species soon. It was last seen over 20 years ago.

       An interesting essay in Saturday's Guardian:  urlLink Our most dangerous export, by Amy Chua . Professor Chua presents a compelling case. Instituting universal suffrage on nations long repressed under the boot of oppressive regimes only leads to anarchy. In case after case, once the despots are removed and 'free elections' are introduced, long simmering ethnic hatred of the poor minority towards the wealthy, economically advantaged minority flares up and results in a paroxysm of violence. Indonesia 1998: with the ouster of General Suharto, native Indonesians rose up against the minority Chinese shopkeepers. Over 2000 people were dragged from their homes and murdered by vengeful crowds.  When sudden democratisation gives voice to this previously silenced majority, opportunistic demagogues can swiftly marshal animosity into powerful ethno-nationalist movements that can subvert both markets and democracy. That is what happened in Indonesia, Zimbabwe, and most recently Bolivia, where weeks of majority-supported, Amerindian-led protests resulted in the resignation of the pro-US, pro-free-market "gringo" President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. In another variation, recent confiscations by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of the assets of the "oligarchs" Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky and Mikhail Khodorkovsky - all well-known in Russia to be Jewish - were facilitated by pervasive anti-semitic resentment among the Russian majority. And Iraq is the next flashpoint. The Sunni Ba’athists repressed the Shiite majority for decades, and the Kurds in the north are extremely wary of any Arab rule. Already Shiite clerics and demagogues are calling for elections, knowing that universal elections will open the door for a Shiite government, preferably one that resembles neighboring Iran's hard line theocracy. The only thing uniting the various fronts in Iraq right now is the desire to see the American and British occupying army leave. Once they leave Iraq will slide into ethnic violence and anarchy.  Taking the concept further, Chua argues that the United States is seen as the oppressive minority on the world stage. With only a fraction of the world's population, the US wields unprecedented economic and military clout on the far poorer nations of the world. This explains while the world was so adamantly set against the US led invasion of Iraq - in spite of compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein was a tyrannical despot torturing and murdering his own people. 'This opposition to the US was closely bound up with deep feelings of resentment and fear of American power and cynicism about motives.'  So what's the answer? Were do we go from here? How does Iraq become a multi-ethnic pluralistic democracy, a beacon in the Middle East? Unfortunately Chua is rather vague about what steps need to be taken. She seems to be advocating some form of limited representation, starting with local democratic governments and gradually percolating up to the entire nation. But what government exists to keep the country from slipping into anarchy while this localized democratic tradition is built up? Some form of an American proxy government? Some jury-rigged contraption administered by the UN? Nothing seems workable at this point. Iraqis want their country back, even if anarchy ensues.  She does make a valid point that Western democracies did not adopt universal suffrage for women and minorities instantly. It took decades of work to create a system that gives everyone a seat at the table, while protecting the rights of minorities. Maybe the bloody cycle of revenge and violence is inevitable

        Some distressing news from the BBC: The population of the Pacific leatherback turtle has plummeted in the last 22 years, and  urlLink the turtles could be extinct within a decade .  urlLink Conservancy International  announced the plight of the creatures at the  urlLink 24 th  Annual Symposium on Sea Turtle Conservation and Biology . And while the Pacific leatherback is in particularly dire straits, virtually every other species of sea turtle  urlLink is threatened  and on the  urlLink endangered species list .  Guam  hosts nesting sites for several turtle species, specifically hawksbill and green sea turtles, but I've never heard of leatherbacks being seen in the waters around the island. While turtles are a protected species, they are quite uncommon on Guam since they are quite a delicacy. Green sea turtle is especially sought after. Just mention turtle to some of my friends and they will start salivating. And hawksbill turtles are sought after for their shell, to make exquisite shell jewelry.  Named for its smooth, leathery skin, the leatherback has graced ocean waters from the tropics to the Arctic since the time of the dinosaurs more than 100 million years ago. But scientists have documented a precipitous decline of the Pacific leatherback in the past two decades. Since 1982, their numbers have dropped from approximately 115,000 reproductive females to fewer than 3,000 remaining today, a decline of 97 percent.  "On land, the canary in the coal mine warns humans of impending environmental danger," said Roderic Mast, Conservation International Vice President and President of the International Sea Turtle Society. "Sea turtles act as our warning mechanism for the health of the ocean, and what they're telling us is quite alarming. Their plummeting numbers are, unfortunately, symptomatic of the ocean as a whole."  The situation is critical, but scientists hope to bring the species back from the brink of extinction. Two particular areas need focused attention:   urlLink Nesting beaches  require stronger protections and more  urlLink careful management . Uncontrolled beachfront development and the poaching of eggs are threats to their survival. Lights on land present another threat, since turtles confuse them for  urlLink the moon and walk toward them , leaving them stranded and unable to return to the ocean. Stronger protections to beaches in St. Croix and South Africa, for example, have allowed leatherback populations to begin rebounding.  The ocean needs greater levels of protection and the fishing industry needs to employ new and safer techniques. Currently, less than one-half of one percent of the ocean enjoys formal protection. Fishermen targeting fish species often unintentionally kill sea turtles as 'by-catch.' Small and inexpensive changes to fishing techniques, such as slightly larger hooks and traps from which sea turtles can escape, can dramatically cut the mortality rate. Particularly deadly to turtle populations is long-line fishing. Long-lining is a practice in which ships extend up to 145 kilometers of fishing line with as many as 8,000 hooks, many of which unintentionally capture and kill sea turtles instead of their intended targets of fish.  This is terrible. Absolutely terrible. Sea turtles are the most inoffensive creatures I've ever encountered. They are slow, graceful grazers of the open sea. The world would be diminished by the loss of these species. Perhaps the challenges of the modern are too great for such an ancient and sublime animal though. Far too often people read something like this, shrug their shoulders and promptly forget all about it. The pressures of everyday life are too great to spare much concern for turtles in a far away place.  I feel no small amount of guilt in this myself, for I have eaten sea turtle several times in my life. But somehow I think the portion of sea turtle caught and eaten by Pacific Islanders is not too blame for this catastrophe. They have fished and hunted these waters for millennia with no adverse affects on the marine ecosystem. It is the modern world, with the development of coastal areas and factory fishing that strip mines the ocean of all life in the name of profits, these are the culprits in this debacle.  But all is not lost. Scientists and conservationists at the conference highlighted several international success stories that demonstrate that well-planned conservation efforts can halt and reverse the decline of the sea turtles.  For example, four Latin American nations, the United Nations Foundation, UNESCO's World Heritage Centre and Conservation International's Global Conservation Fund are investing several million dollars over the next three years to consolidate a marine protected area that stretches from Ecuador to Costa Rica. Let's hope this can stem the losses to the Pacific leatherback and bring the species back from the brink.

        urlLink BBC NEWS | Health | Fruit reduces heart disease risk  - Yes it really is true: Eating apples and other fibrous fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of heart disease. Eating 10 grams of fiber a day (about three apples) reduces the chance of dying by heart disease by 27% and the chance of suffering a heart attack by 14%. All that fiber cleans out the cholesterol from the body.  Excuse me while I go eat an apple.

       Everyday I return home to find the road construction has changed in my neighborhood. Lanes switch and rearrange, barriers are put up, pavement is ripped out, gravel is laid out. It is all very confusing, but they really seem to be in a mad dash to finish off the upper sections of the highway construction in Yona. The lower portions of the roadwork, leading down the hill to the Ylig River Bridge are still a mess, but everyday more portions of the highway up by my house are paved. Alleluia, alleluia. I can't wait for it to be over.

       Though I wouldn't exactly call myself a practicing Catholic, some traditions die hard.  urlLink The faithful observed Ash Wednesday  yesterday, and while it has been years since I stepped foot inside a church I still found myself fasting yesterday. And I gave up candy, sweets and snacks too. I'd give up soda, but I already abandoned my Coke dependency at New Year's. I figure a little hardship is a good thing, and I can certainly cut out egg salad sandwiches and my candy grazing habits at work.

       Some bomber related news today:   urlLink B-52's Arrive On Island  - Guam received the first of a contingent of B-52 Stratofortress bombers to be permanently stationed on the island. While the planes will continue to be stationed out of North Dakota, a revolving contingent will be continuously maintained on the island. Apparently this is being done to reinforce U.S. forces in the Asia/Pacific theater as ground troops are redeployed to the Middle East. Local leaders are enthusiastic about the pre-positioning because it will mean more jobs and money injected into the island's economy.   urlLink WWII B-24 bomber located in Palau  - A downed B-24 Liberator bomber was located in the waters off Palau recently. It is assumed that the bomber still contains the remains of the servicemen that perished when the plane was shot down shortly before the U.S. invasion of Palau in September 1944. The POW/MIA Command in Hawaii was notified about the wreck and they are expected to recover the servicemen's remains.   urlLink The Last Mission  - I never knew this bit of  urlLink Guam's WWII history .  urlLink The Last Mission  was took off from Northwest Field on August 14 th  and bombed Tokyo. The heavy bombardment curtailed a planned military coup to depose Emperor Hirohito before he could surrender to the U.S. invasion. Interesting stuff, but there is not a single marker commemorating this final mission of WWII at Northwest Field. Perhaps the 60 th  anniversary of Guam's Liberation is a fitting time to dedicate a memorial to this final act of World War II.

She hasn't whelped another pup in almost four hours, so I suspect it might be over. I am taking a break from the bathroom/maternity ward and I thought I'd post some photos of the litter.               urlLink Dianne  looks a little worn out in that last photo huh? I hope she doesn't get to tired with all those puppies around the house in the coming weeks.

       Since I was such a slacker last week, I let several major news story slip right by me. I guess I should go ahead and link to the big news stories from Guam for everyone's perusal.    Politics    urlLink Gil Shinohara Indicted  - Former Gutierrez administration Chief of Staff was  urlLink indicted on over a dozen charges  by federal attorneys. The charges revolve around bilking the FEMA with fraudulent claims after typhoon Paka in 1997, and bank and wire fraud apparently with the complicity of former senator Willy Flores.   urlLink Carl Gutierrez Pleads Innocent  - Carl Gutierrez declared his innocence Friday in the Superior Court, denying that he used $64,000 of government money and labor to construct his pleasure dome along the Uranao cliffline.   urlLink Cliff Guzman Pleads Innocent  - Cliff Guzman pleaded innocent last week to charges that he ordered the government to absorb the cost of numerous private street lights; Carl Gutierrez  urlLink has yet to enter a plea  in this case.   urlLink Rosie Tainatongo Indicted  - Former Department of Administration Director Rosie Tainatongo was indicted last Friday for misuse of government funds to aid in a Liberation Day contestant's bid to be Liberation Queen.   urlLink Audit Reveals 'Enhanced' Retirement Pay For Elected Official  - Public Auditor Doris Brooks released the results of an audit of the Government of Guam Retirement Fund and the bombshell was how an unnamed executive branch official had his retirement pay doubled in a questionable arrangement with the Director of the Retirement Fund, bypassing any oversight by the board of the retirement fund.  urlLink The former director defended his actions , but it certainly raised eyebrows around the island.   urlLink Democrats Introduce Wage Hike  - In a move designed to stir public comment, Democrats introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage on Guam to $7.50 an hour. Local businesses cried  urlLink foul instantly , and Republicans accused the Democrats of pandering for votes in an election year.   Environment    urlLink Deal Reached In Ordot Dump Closure  - Well it looks like the progress is actually being made  urlLink on closing the Ordot Dump . Public Works is researching  urlLink locations for the new dump  and    urlLink Erosion Control Project Begins At Talofofo Beach Park  - For the last few years the beach has been slipping into the sea at Talofofo Beach Park. The erosion increased rapidly following typhoon Pongsona in 2002. By last month, several pavilions and restrooms were on the verge of tumbling into the waves. So the Department of Parks and Recreation finally got moving with a plan to halt the erosion.  urlLink Giant limestone boulders  are being placed along the shore to absorb the waves energy and hopefully halt the deterioration.   urlLink Scientists To Map Guam's Water Table  - The Guam EPA, USGS and  urlLink WERI  received $400,000 grant to produce a modern three-dimensional map of Guam's water table. It is hoped this study will lead to better water resource management and prevent salt water encroachment in the priceless fresh water lens that supplies Guam's fresh water supply.   urlLink Invasive Species Of Frog Found On Island  -  Two male coqui frogs were recently found on Guam. The frogs are an invasive species that probably arrived on ornamental plants shipped from Hawaii. While the frogs are not a threat to local wildlife, they do produce an earsplitting racket. In a related story, Guam is  urlLink relaxing the importation  of ornamental plants to the island. I guess we need more exotic animal species sneaking into the island.   urlLink Still No Archaeologist Working At Ylig Site  - Go figure. It's been almost a year now since ancient Chamorro remains were found at the Ylig Bay end of the Route 4 expansion project and still no archaeologists have excavated the site. The Department of Public Works is hoping some magical fairy archaeologists appear and do the work pro bono. Meanwhile, looters and wild dogs pillage the site. Somebody deserves a prize for this fuck-up.   Other News Of Interest    urlLink Explosion Disables Saipan Mobile Phone Company  - In probably the weirdest story of the past few weeks, a large explosion crippled the cellular provider iConnect on Saipan on February 7. An explosion destroyed the company's transmitter located atop Mount Tapochao, and damaged both the FBI and NOAA transmitters too.  urlLink That brought in the FBI , and they quickly rounded up  urlLink three suspects that readily confessed  when presented the evidence. Seems the owner of a rival cellular firm paid two employees to fly up from Guam to Saipan to disable iConnect and bring him some business. Too bad he picked a couple knuckleheads that got caught of videotape.   urlLink Marine Dies In Freak Accident  - A marine drowned earlier this week when his tank slipped off an amphibious assault craft during training in Apra Harbor. The tank slipped off the side of the hovercraft and sank in 90 feet of water.   urlLink Renowned Painter   urlLink Creates Mural At Airport  - Renowned ocean artist Wyland was on island for almost two weeks painting  urlLink a mural at the Guam International Airport . He met with many school and  urlLink local artists  during his stay on island.   urlLink Catholic Relic Installed At Hagatna Cathedral  - A bone fragment from St. Therese of Liseaux was installed at the Dulce Nombre de Maria Cathedral in Hagatna. The remains of the 'Little Flower' visited Guam in 2002, and the response was enormous. As a gift to the people of Guam, this bone fragment was  urlLink installed in the cathedral .  So I guess a lot happened on Guam the last couple weeks. I'll try to stay on top of the news in the future.

       Seems like ages since I posted anything about watch I've been watching and reading lately, so let's get that off the plate right now:  Movies & Television   urlLink Logan's Run  - Watched it this afternoon. A fast paced sci-fi adventure, with a dire warning of what could happen in our youth obsessed culture. After watching the entire movie I realized there's not a single black or oriental person in the cast of hundreds. Hmm. Looks like the future turns out all white.   urlLink Never Cry Wolf  - A great little film, full of beautiful photography and natural vistas. It goes out of its way to paint civilization in a bad light, and sings the praises of the frozen tundra. Watch this movie and write your congressman about protecting the  urlLink ANWR .   urlLink 28 Days Later  - It bogs down in the last act, but the opening scenes of a desolate, depopulated London are chilling.   urlLink Pirates Of The Caribbean  - Better than I expected. Fun in a cartoony way. But why is this children's movie well over two hours long? For that matter, why are so many movies so damn long these days? Is there a shortage of editors in Hollywood?   urlLink Buena Vista Social Club  - Okay, but I was pretty bored by the movie documentary. I prefer the album.   urlLink The Man From Snowy River  - This is a great adventure story, with the added pleasure of watching Kirk Douglas chew the scenery in two roles. The roundup at the end of the movie is riveting stuff.   urlLink Falling Down  - Hey, it's Kirk Douglas' son Michael going postal on Los Angeles. Pretty grim when I think about it, but I admit I laughed at the situations Michael Douglas keeps getting into - especially the bit on the golf course.   urlLink The Black Stallion  - I loved this movie when I was a kid. I couldn't get enough of it. Beautiful film, with a lovely score by Carmine Coppola. The best part is when the boy and the horse are marooned on the desert island. Absolutely gorgeous stuff. And you never even notice that nary a word is spoken for over a half hour.   urlLink Avalon  - Good. Not as good as  urlLink Diner  (which I watched about two months ago), but good. America is great, but television stole the soul of our people. I couldn't agree more. Barry Levinson's done a good thing with his Baltimore movies.   urlLink Existenz  - An interesting, squishy sci-fi, cyberpunky sort of thing.   urlLink The Last Temptation Of Christ  - It's a pale shadow of Nikos Kazantzakis novel, but I admire Martin Scorsese for tackling such a sensitive subject. I remember the furor over this film's release, as the Catholic Church condemned the film and various television evangelists launched a crusade against the defamation of the Gospels, without ever once viewing the film. Reminds me of the  urlLink current brouhaha  over  urlLink Mel Gibson's Passion , though this time it is the liberals crying foul and the religious authorities defending the film. Funny how the wheel turns isn't it?   urlLink The Great Train Robbery  - Fun crime caper adventure. It looked like Sean Connery really was running around on top of a moving train. Gutsy move by a major actor.   urlLink Children Of A Lesser God  - Powerful story. Funny, I'd never seen the movie. I watched the play a few years ago, but this was my first time watching Marlee Matlin and John Hurt together.  Books   urlLink The Third Wave  - Alvin Toffler's groundbreaking work of futurist thought. I read this in high school almost twenty years ago, and it is amazing how much he foresaw has come to pass.   urlLink Watership Down  - Richard Adam's story of dispossessed rabbits and their struggle to find a safe new home is a good one. I read this when I was a kid and couldn't resist checking it out of the library a few weeks ago.  An high adventure of small scale and great import for us humans.   urlLink The Temple Of The Golden Pavilion  - Mishima's story of beauty and impotence and the pent up rage of the powerless.   urlLink Fast Food Nation  - Makes me scared to eat at McDonald's. Eric Schlosser wrote a chilling account of our addiction to fast food, and the environmental, social, economic and health costs it entails.   urlLink Gai-Jin  - Classic work of historical fiction by James Clavell. I just started this yesterday, so not much to say about it yet.  Obviously, I've been watching a great deal of movies lately. I guess it's easier to relax in front of the television after work instead of reading a book.

       One of my favorite authors,  urlLink Ursula Le Guin , recently participated in an  urlLink online Q&A session with readers from Great Britain . The Guardian edited the transcripts and posted them online. Excellent stuff, and some good insight on Le Guin's thinking and creative process.  And if you are at all interested, check out some of her novels like  urlLink The Left Hand of Darkness ,  urlLink The Dispossessed ,  urlLink The Lathe of Heaven  or her many  urlLink Earthsea  books. I'd recommend starting with the original trilogy;  urlLink A Wizard of Earthsea ,  urlLink The Tombs of Atuan , and  urlLink The Farthest Shore . These books really moved me when I was a kid. I intend to reread them a little later this year, along with some of Le Guin's newer stuff.  The Q&A session is fascinating stuff, revealing how she thinks up the stories and what inspires her. I certainly didn't know that she translated Lao Tzu's  urlLink Tao Te Ching  and is an avowed Taoist, though I guess it makes sense reading her novels.

       My good friend and former roommate Craig Cleland was on-island last weekend for a couple days and we hooked up on Saturday night for a little R&R in Tumon Bay. We started at the Outrigger Hotel, grabbed some Vietnamese food at Hoa Mai, sampled the fine  urlLink Great Deep Brewing Company Beers at Mac & Marti's , and finished off the night at the ever smoky Tower of London.          We met up again on Sunday for a bbq at another friend's house, where I drank a great deal of beer. In fact I had a hangover the next day that lasted the entire day (and into the night). It was good to see Craig again, it seems like ages since he lived on Guam. In fact it was almost four years ago that he left island to pursue his fortunes. Funny how time flies.  Good to see you Craig, come back again soon.

       Call me a slacker; I got a little lazy last week and stopped posting. By the time I wanted to post something on Saturday, my ISP went down in a burst of flames and remains down until today. Their router died, cutting off all their customers from the internet. Bummer.  But that is a lame excuse. Connectivity wasn't lost until Saturday. I just got lazy last week and took a break. Now I am back, and raring to go. If only my ISP would fix their problems. At least I still have internet access at work.

        And now NASA releases a composite photo showing the Opportunity Rover's landing site at Meridiani Planum, taken from passing satellites in Mars orbit. The images were composited to create this graphic. The parachute is visible along the left side of the image, while the heatshield appears to have landed below the prominent crater at the right.   Perhaps most exciting is the mark Opportunity made in the soil on its first, initial bounce. The imprint is plainly visible, which is a good indicator of the looseness of the soil and its fine, dustlike nature. Matching sightings taken by Opportunity with these high detail satellite photos (and photos the rover took during its descent), NASA was able to determine the precise location of the small crater where the rover came to rest.  So now we know the neighborhood, let's go meet some of the neighbors. Like that big honking crater about a kilometer away. Maybe there's a Quickie Mart in there or something.

        Here's a hot one: Scientists at the  urlLink University of Queensland  announced  urlLink the discovery of identical magnetic crystals  in both the infamous  urlLink Martian meteorite  and samples of terrestrial bacteria.  In 1996,  urlLink NASA  stunned the world by  urlLink announcing evidence  of life found  urlLink within a meteorite  recovered in Antarctica. They found  urlLink evidence of organic chemicals , microfossils, and mineral waste products in close proximity to each other within the meteorite, leading to their conclusion that life existed in the cracks within the rock. But questions still remain: Are these materials evidence of life or some other process? And if they are by products of bacteria, could they merely be the remains of terrestrial microbes infiltrating the meteorite? All in all, questions remain before a definitive answer can be found.  But this new announcement could the valuable corroboration. The UQ team identified microscopic, magnetic crystals within the meteorite that matched crystals contained in the structures of common terrestrial bacteria collected on a golf course.  Dr Taylor, who now works for the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation in Sydney, said this research seriously challenges doubts of skeptical scientists by discovering that many bacteria match the features found in the Martian meteorite.  "Our research shows that the structures found in the NASA meteorite were more than likely made by bacteria present on Mars four billion years ago, before life even started on Earth," said Dr Taylor.  How cool is that? Did life once exist on Mars? Even more tantalizing; did life on Mars provide the seed for life on our planet billions of years ago? People wonder why we send probe after probe to Mars, looking for evidence of water and life - well here's a pretty good reason. The discovery of extra-terrestrial life ought to be a worthy subject of scientific research. And those  urlLink two rovers  putting around on the red planet right now are helping to answer these questions.

       I seem to recall mentioning a similar story long ago, but I will go ahead and give a nod to this story about the  urlLink quarantining of dissenters and protesters  from anywhere near President George W. Bush. Those with differing opinions are sequestered miles away from the media and public attention in "free speech zones," an  urlLink Orwellian  Newspeak term if there ever was one. I found particularly galling the tale about the protester who was arrested for trespassing in a public park, after police picked his sole dissenting poster out of a mass of pro-Bush banners.  The problem is not just the abuse of power and the curtailing of civil liberties that the current administration has embarked upon. It is the apathy of most Americans in the face of these assaults on civil liberties. We are like frogs, slowly boiling as the water heats up, yet too comfortable to hop out of the pot. Everyday another barrage of images on the television dulls our senses and fills our heads with propaganda. Forget religion, television is the opiate of the masses.  urlLink Media demagogues  preach ever more extreme views and seek to destroy the freedoms established by generations.  urlLink Violence is glorified ,  urlLink ignorance championed  - where will it lead? What is to become of us? Will the interminable  urlLink War on Terror  become a  urlLink New Imperial Century ?   First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out--     because I was not a communist; Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out--     because I was not a socialist; Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out--     because I was not a trade unionist; Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out--     because I was not a Jew; Then they came for me--     and there was no one left to speak out for me.   urlLink Rev.

       The best news I've heard all week: Microbrewery resurfaces at  urlLink Mac & Marti's in Tumon . The Great Deep Brewing Company guys used to work their magic out of Le Tasi Bistro in Hagatna, but differences with the restaurants owners forced them out early last year. I was bummed out, because Thursday nights at Le Tasi were becoming a habit of mine; good beer, tasty tapas menu, and my friends the Pago Bay Reefers playing a couple sets. And while two of those three ingredients still exist at Le Tasi, I must admit I really enjoyed the beer on tap.  Now I get the chance to swill their brew once again. They are tapping a keg at Mac & Marti's down in Tumon, one of Guam's new trendy bars. I guess I need to start braving Tumon's horrible traffic once again and taste that great beer.

Nosing around on the  urlLink Robpongi.com  website, I came across  urlLink this mesmerizing video  of a  urlLink shamisen   urlLink player . Good stuff.

       Found an interesting article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch about a St. Louis resident's  urlLink amazing creativity software . Stephen Thaler's software can actually write original music, create new words, and produce new marketable products, like the  urlLink Oral B CrossAction toothbrush . By introducing noise into a neural network, his Creativity Machine actually produces new ideas.  His first patent was for a Device for the Autonomous Generation of Useful Information, the official name of the Creativity Machine... His second patent was for the Self-Training Neural Network Object. Patent Number Two was invented by Patent Number One. Think about that. Patent Number Two was invented by Patent Number One!  Could this be a first step toward an actual artificial intelligence? Creativity is one of the cornerstones of human intelligence. It is certainly a fascinating development and I suggest reading the article and visiting Thaler's company website for more information on the  urlLink Creativity Machine .

       It was a helluva game;  urlLink Jake Delhomme  and the Panthers really fought tooth and nail. I was especially impressed by Carolina's old geezer receiving corps stepping up to the plate.  urlLink Ricky Proehl  and  urlLink Muhsin Muhammed  are not exactly youngsters in the league but they caught the balls that mattered and kept Carolina in the game.  And I certainly think that was the  urlLink best halftime show  I've ever seen.  urlLink Thanks Janet ! I about coughed up my lunch when that boob popped out. I wasn't surprised by the media silence about the breast exposure, but when they deliberately censor out the streaker at the beginning of the second half and how  urlLink Matt Chatham   urlLink tackled the dude  so the cops could catch him, well that bothers me. I remember this odd silence as we waited for the kickoff, and thinking it was probably a streaker since nothing usually stops the talking meatheads and their color commentary.  Oh yeah, I didn't win anything at Planet Hollywood either. For the second year in a row the winning ticket to the Pro Bowl went to a kid. I am beginning to think the whole thing is rigged. And for $40, I expect to win something - or at least keep me stocked in beer. The damn place ran out of beer at halftime. I think next year I will just watch the game at home.

       Tomorrow the GRT  urlLink is reduced from 6%  back down to 4% , and its about time. The additional gross receipts tax was a burden on people at a time when the island's economy could not handle it. Instead of facing the problems of GovGuam head on and actually reducing the bloated government payroll, legislators increased taxes by 50% and instituted a new round of fees on all sorts of government licenses. Believe me, voters will remember who was for increasing taxes this November - it was the Democrats.  Now it goes against my political grain to vote Republican, but it must be stated, those taxes didn't add any services or special protections to the government operations. They did it so they wouldn't have to lay off people on the government's payroll. They took a look at the political fallout from raising taxes and decided it was an easier pill to swallow than being the first legislature in the island's history to actually reduce, instead of increase, the island's government workforce.

       So it looks like this is really going to happen: A film crew will  urlLink start shooting   Max Havoc  in May of this year, here on Guam. They listed the stars in the movie, and the only one I recognize is Carmen Electra, that chick that I think was married to Dennis Rodman or something. Other than her, the stars named were from Germany and Taiwan. I guess this is a straight to video effort, but it might be entertaining to check this out in the coming months.

       It appears  urlLink Apple  has finally  urlLink killed off  the moribund  urlLink HyperCard .  I remember it well, it was an amazing product that really opened my eyes to how cool a software could be. It was so damn easy to make functional little software stacks, I made a stack that housed all my bibliographies during my college years, and outputted them in a suitable format for  urlLink WriteNow , my trusty old word processor. The real problem with HyperCard was simple: It was a memory hog - and slower than tar on my Macintosh SE. If I started up HyperCard, nothing else would run on my computer with its paltry 2 megabytes of RAM. And once I moved up to a color computer with more oomph, HyperCard was fossilized, stuck in the old black & white world with 9 inch screens System 6.  I guess Apple never really knew what to do with the software and stopped promoting after a couple years. But they were heady times in the late 80's, lot's of stacks swapped around on floppies. Some really amazing stuff was created with HyperCard - and the greatest was  urlLink  If Monks Had Macs  . This collection of stacks was incredible, they were a quantum leap beyond anything else I had ever seen done in HyperCard. Provocative essays and quirky explorations,  If Monks Had Macs  was probably the first successful multimedia I experienced. For those that are interested,  urlLink  If Monks Had Macs   has  urlLink been updated  and  urlLink released  for both Mac and PC, using a successor to HyperCard,  urlLink Runtime Revolution .

       Found an interesting website this week called  urlLink Red Nova ; it's focus is on space and astronomy subjects. Like this one about  urlLink The Slowest (And Fastest) Train In The Universe  - the Mobile Transporter upon the ISS space station. The top speed of the MT is 2.5 cm per second, making it one of the slowest rail lines ever created. But it is also one of the fastest because the ISS is orbiting our planet at 28,000 km per hour.

       Spent yesterday at a bbq with some friends from work. Nothing like a day at the beach, eating bbq and drinking beer. The crew from Materials always has a good time. Even though I moved on to another department ages ago, I still get invited to their department functions. This party was an early Easter celebration. The location varies from year to year, this year the site was the  urlLink United Seamen's Service  property (the old  urlLink USO ) in Piti. (The place is right next to the Cabras power plants and the port, so if anybody wonders about the industrial background in some photos, those are Guam's base load generators.) The highlight of the afternoon was the Easter Egg Hunt for the kiddies, and it was amicable chaos as usual. Lots of running and screaming and good fun for everyone.  Check out some photos:                              I was pretty tired when I got home, so I took a nice nap before heading out for another little party at a neighbor's house. Sorry no pictures of that though. It was a good day, lots of sunshine and fun.

       Boy I opened my mouth too soon. Gas prices shot up another 5¢ last week, making regular unleaded $2.25 a gallon. This is becoming ridiculous. But what is really ridiculous? The amount of money some people pour into their gas tanks. Everybody quoted in the Pacific Daily News article on  urlLink price hikes at the pumps  fill their vehicles two or three times a week. Damn. I visit the gas station about once every two weeks and I think that is bad. People are addicted to their automobiles here on Guam.

       This is pretty darn odd: Seems  urlLink Long John Silver's , purveyors of fried seafood across the States, is celebrating NASA's discovery of an  urlLink ancient ocean on Mars  with  urlLink free shrimp . I guess it's great news if you love greasy, battered pseudo-fish.  One of these restaurants opened on Guam a few months ago, and I finally tried their food last week. I never tried Long John Silver's back Stateside, and I don't think I'll try it again. If I ever have a hankering for tons of batter-fried food, I can't do better than  urlLink Kinney's  out in Pagat, Mangilao. They got four things on the menu, deep fried shrimp, deep fried chicken, deep fried mahi mahi and chop steak. Oh, and those killer onion rings -  urlLink Kinney's  got the best on Guam. Much better than Long John Silver's anyday.

       Do we owe our intelligence to mutation that reduced our species' jaw size and strength? A new  urlLink Gene study suggests early humans traded mighty bite for bigger brains . About the time our hominid ancestors started developing bigger brains a genetic mutation appeared that crippled the development of powerful jawbones and their requisite muscles girdling the skull. The theory goes that once the skull was freed of the burden of supporting massive jaw and cheek muscles, early hominid cranial size exploded.

       Took the long way home tonight. The fiery sun set into the Pacific as I tooled down Marine Drive. Instead of taking my usual route I kept heading south, all the way to Agat. The power of the sun compelled me. I watched it sink into the ocean, and as the sky turned purple and pink with sunset, I turned the Blue Torpedo eastward along Cross Island Road.  Nothing like a nice drive home to unwind after a hard day at the office. Seems like everything I am working on is due by next Monday. Oof. I need a vacation. Pretty sad, since I just got back from one two weeks ago.

       One of my favorite blogs lately is  urlLink Pharyngula , written by Paul Myers, associate professor of biology at the  urlLink University of Minnesota, Morris . Dr. Myers is a tireless advocate of evolution education, shining the spotlight on creationists, 'intelligent design' supporters, and their efforts to expunge evolution and scientific thinking from the curriculum across the country.  Monday  urlLink he posted  a link to a lucid and well written defense of evolution, a statement published by the Botanical Society of America:  urlLink Botanical Society of America's Evolution Statement . It defends the use of evolution as a scientific theory and exposes creationism as "scientific uselessness," that offers not "a single contribution to agriculture, medicine, conservation, forestry, pathology, or any other applied area of biology."

       Came across this story about  urlLink the rising cost of gasoline . This article from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch is griping about $1.64 per gallon prices. Crap. I can't remember the last time gas was a $1.64 on Guam. Honestly, in ten years of driving gas has never been below $1.72 or so on Guam. The price for regular unleaded is currently a scorching $2.20 a gallon. I am just glad I don't drive around in a big old SUV like so many mopes on this island. I think it's time to start biking to work again.

       Two things:  The power went out for a second morning in a row today. Yesterday it died in my village a little after 7:00 am and was out for a couple hours, today a long brownout (great for the appliances and computers!) at 8:10 preceded an  urlLink island-wide outage . Parts of the island-wide grid are slowly being energized. The cause? Probably a big  urlLink brown tree snake  - that was a popular excuse a few years ago.  Speaking of the  urlLink brown tree snake , I was just outside making a call on my cellular when I heard this odd noise. I turned around and saw a pidgeon. Holy crap! A bird on Guam, even a common pidgeon, is always a surprise. I was startled by what I saw, after all birds are non-existent on Guam, thanks to the  urlLink brown tree snake .

       The  urlLink Mars Rover Spirit  caught an interesting object with it's panoramic camera earlier this month. While taking images of the crepuscular sky on Mars, Spirit captured  urlLink an image with a streaking object  passing overhead.

       Guam's healthcare system appears to be coming apart at the seams. The doctors are in  urlLink revolt against the hospital , with the OB/Gyn's saying they will refuse to accept hospital house patients. House patients are people that show up at the hospital without any medical coverage or regular doctor. GMH forces the island's doctors to treat these people in exchange for hospital privileges. The problem is GMH rarely pays the doctors for these visits, which can amount to over 50% of a physician's practice for the obstetricians. The doctors are tired of this, and other problems with the high premiums for malpractice insurance on island.   urlLink The hospital is deeply in arrears , after losing over $10 million last year. Hospital administrator Bill McMillan said 40% of the hospital's $100 million in expenditures must be written off because it must provide healthcare to the island's indigent population and those with no health insurance.  And last week brought more bad news.  urlLink The island's only cancer treatment center  will be closing in less than a month. The Cancer Institute of Guam will shutter its doors on April 8, forcing all those patients receiving chemotherapy to seek off island treatment. Not good, not good at all.

       Okay, time for some more information on this  urlLink new world that NASA astronomers discovered . The new planet has been christened Sedna, after the Inuit goddess of the ocean. It is about three fourths the size of Pluto, and the second reddest object in the solar system. And it is way out there, with a wildly elliptical 10,500 year orbit. Sedna is well beyond the orbit of Pluto and currently approaching perihelion (an object's closest approach the the sun). In about 72 years Sedna will start it's long cold journey away from the sun and back towards the Oort Cloud, a region that astronomers theorize contain many of the planetoids that occassionally tumble to the sun and become comets. It boggles the mind to think that the last time this planetoid approached the sun, Earth was locked in an ice age  Here's the relative sizes of this new planet, Pluto and the Earth.    And check out the orbit of this thing. It is absolutely huge.

       Oh those crazy Californians!  urlLink Calif. Officials Nearly Fall for H2O Hoax  City officials were so concerned about the potentially dangerous properties of dihydrogen monoxide that they considered banning foam cups after they learned the chemical was used in their production.  Then they learned, to their chagrin, that dihydrogen monoxide _ H2O for short _ is the scientific term for water.  "It's embarrassing," said City Manager David J. Norman. "We had a paralegal who did bad research."  The paralegal apparently fell victim to one of the many official looking Web sites that have been put up by pranksters to describe dihydrogen monoxide as "an odorless, tasteless chemical" that can be deadly if accidentally inhaled.  As a result, the City Council of this Orange County suburb had been scheduled to vote next week on a proposed law that would have banned the use of foam containers at city-sponsored events. Among the reasons given for the ban were that they were made with a substance that could "threaten human health and safety."  The measure has been pulled from the agenda, although Norman said the city may still eventually ban foam cups.  "If you get Styrofoam into the water and it breaks apart, it's virtually impossible to clean up," Norman said.

       We had a department luncheon today, one of the underwriters is leaving the company and taking a position at  urlLink Continental Micronesia . The combined departments of Facets, Pricing and IT took him out to lunch at the  urlLink Joinus Restaurant  for teppanyaki. I am ashamed to admit it was the first time I ever stepped foot inside the  urlLink Tumon Sands Plaza , after 11 years of living on Guam. I guess I ain't the target demographic for Cartier, Rolex, Tiffany & Co. and the rest of the ritzy stores in that little mall.  Despite the tony surroundings, the Joinus Restaurant seemed a bit rundown. It was certainly dark and claustrophobic, there is not a window in the restaurant. However the restaurant packed in the patrons for one reason: a great deal on teppanyaki. People on Guam know a good deal when it involves food. The price of any one of three set teppan menus is $10.99 - the options all include sirloin steak and shrimp along with a choice of chicken, salmon or scallops. I cannot remember the last time I ate teppanyaki, easily two years or more. I like teppanyaki too, but the closure of the Kurumaya Seahorse in 2002 set me adrift. God I miss that place. I spent many an evening there, relaxing after paddling practice, enjoying Tumon's warm sands and the fading twilight over the Philippine Sea. It is a crying shame the restaurant was closed down and the building demolished, especially since the developer never built a damn thing on that lot. A vibrant business destroyed and turned into a vacant lot. Seems to happen all the time on island.

       Here's a couple good things I found trolling the internet last night:    urlLink NPR : Walter Cronkite  - Walter Cronkite's commentary about Edward R.

He suggests people need to expand their personal space beyond their four walls and start thinking about their communities, and start thinking about the ramifications of their actions and lifestyles on our descendants, and our descendant's descendants. That is all. Time to unplug for the day.

       Ever since I read  urlLink Fast Food Nation  I cringe at the thought of eating at McDonald's and the other fast food joints on Guam. The portion of the book that dealt with slaughterhouses and the meatpacking industry was particularly chilling. The fact that cattle are fed meal with ground up pets and other cows just grossed me out.  Now comes this  urlLink chilling article  on what really goes into pet food. My poor cat eats that crap every day. Ugh. Ground up lungs and bone, smothered in used restaurant grease. Cripes.

       To those that understand (Craig, Tibbetts, anybody else from Guam); read this and laugh about  urlLink Mushmouth the VC . Guess that tumor is gone. I didn't hear it, but Chris said  urlLink K-57  was having a field day with this little tidbit this afternoon.  That said, I wish Air America all the best. But since he is involved, I highly doubt it is on the up and up.

       I might write up something in greater detail later, but I really don't want to bore people with minutiae of my boring vacation. Here's the two sentence rundown. I spent the first three night in Kuta, partying with Aussies at the  urlLink Barong Hotel  and other spots in Kuta. From Sunday through Tuesday I was in Ubud, relaxing in the sedate atmosphere at  urlLink Pertiwi Resort and Spa , enjoying fine dining and doing a little sightseeing.  I visited the sight of the October 2002 bombings, it is only about 100 meters from the Barong Hotel. A large memorial is now on the location of Paddy's Pub (which relocated about 200 meters down the road). The site of the Sari Club is a somber, vacant lot. Takings pictures seemed sacrilegious.  I ate at a number of good restaurants in Ubud, some new, some retooled, and some golden oldies.  urlLink Lamak  was excellent, good food, great wine selection, though a little pricey. Very pretty girls waiting tables though.  urlLink Bebek Bengil  was very good, as always. And beautiful ambiance with the full moon hanging over the gardens. Mystical. And I know I ate at  urlLink Tutmak  the last time I was in Bali, though it wasn't called Tutmak back in 1999.  It was a relaxing little trip. Bali seems to be coming back from the disaster of 2002. There are still plenty of closed shops and a definite rise in the number of people begging on the streets. But everyone I talked to said things were getting better. There was definitely some anxiety about the  urlLink upcoming Indonesian elections . A couple guys I spoke with thought that terrorists might try to influence the election with another round of attacks on Bali. That is the last thing Bali needs right now.  Without further ado, some pictures I took on Tuesday:                                                        Oh yeah, if you need a taxi in the Kuta area, you can't go wrong with  urlLink Ketut Sukadana . He hangs out at the Barong Hotel.

       Joy. Two of the top three sites GEPA and DPW rated for a new dump are located in Yona. I live in Yona. The last location is also the most likely,  urlLink a remote location in Dandan, Inarajan . While they offer up a slew of reason why the Dandan location is the best for the new landfill, let's face it; number one consideration in this site's rating is the fact that very few people live in Inarajan, and even less up in the savannah regions  of Dandan. Out of sight, out of mind. Never mind if the location selected is one of the most pristine and untouched locations on Guam. It's a great location for a dump.

        CNN is running an AP story about  urlLink Federal officialsseizingggiantn African snails seized from schools in Wisconsin . Apparently these buggers are a dangerous and prohibited animal in the United States, capable of devouring a variety of crops and even spreading meningitis with their slimy mucus. Several schools in Wisconsin had these snails in their classrooms before the federal government swooped in and confiscated the animals.  Sheesh. Somebody ought to tell them that Guam is chock full of these things. They are everywhere. I mean everywhere. I walk in the yard and crunch on these things. The hermit crabs  (duk duk)  appropriate the shells for their mobile homes, the dogsharasss the snails at night and they do eat most everything that grows outside. But I had no idea they are disease carriers. I just assumed they were one of Guam's many plagues (snails, toads, gnats, termites, snakes...). Guess I better tread carefully from now on, I sure don't want to catch meningitis.

       I normally ignore Cal Thomas' columns in the  urlLink Pacific Daily News , his right wing demagoguery is not to my liking. But  urlLink today's column  caught my eye, primarily because I just read an interesting article on Tom Paine.com about  urlLink Al Smith and his disastrous 1928 bid for the presidency . Smith was the immensely popular Democratic governor of New York whose campaign was torpedoed because of his Catholic faith and Irish upbringing. Pundits and columnists questioned his fealty to the United States. "A prominent Episcopalian lawyer published an article in the Atlantic Monthly, questioning Smith's ability to function as president as long as he owed ultimate allegiance to the Pope. Smith dismissed the idea as silly. He declared he had 'never heard of those bulls and encyclicals and books.'" Yet Smith went down in crushing defeat to Herbert Hoover, losing even his home state of New York.  A curious inversion has taken place in the 21 st  century. Instead of Republicans questioning John Kerry's allegiance to the United States, right wing idealogues like Cal Thomas are questioning whether a man that refuses to follow Church doctrine is fit to lead the United States. Thomas states "When Kerry and other Catholic politicians say they accept church teaching but selectively deny it when it comes to abortion, they place the state above the church and man above God. They mortgage their consciences to convenience and principle to pragmatism. Should such a person lead this nation?"  Funny what a difference 76 years makes. Now Republicans are saying that Catholic Democrats are beholden to the Pope, not the Constitution. Black is White, War is Peace.  The instigation for all this furor was the Cardinal Arinze, a potential successor to Pope John Paul II, who stated on Friday  urlLink that politicians who support abortion should be denied communion . While the Cardinal refused to address whether John Kerry should be excluded from the holy sacrament, pro-choice Catholic Democrats rallied behind Kerry and incurred the usual fusillade of vitriol from the right wing attack dogs, including Cal Thomas.  More than a few things here give me pause. First, Cardinal Arinze is not the Pope, the titular head of the church and infallible authority on spiritual matters. Dude's got no authority to speak for the church on this matter. Second, there are plenty of pro-choice Republicans out there, notably Governor George Pataki and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. I don't hear the right wing idiots questioning their authority to govern because they support a woman's right to choose. Lastly, this show of support for the Catholic Church on the abortion issue is rife with hypocrisy. Sure the Church opposes abortion; the church also vehemently condemns the death penalty, something near and dear to Republican's hearts. Don't hear Cal Thomas condemning politicians who authorize state institutionalized murder do you? Funny how folks only pick out the things they want to emphasize and totally ignore other issues. Or perhaps the whole idea of the church trying to dictate temporal, earthly policy in the 21 st  century is a non-issue and we would all be better off if we took religion out of the debate?

       For the first time in a long time I am farting around with different weblogging software and systems. I got myself a  urlLink Xanga site , a  urlLink TypePad page , even a  urlLink Plone site . All this on top of the  urlLink Radio Userland  Salon blog that I never use. Hell, I even created a  urlLink blogspot blog  using blogger so I could check out the features they offered with that hosting service.  Why the flurry of signing up with all these different services? I'm evaluating options for a friend of mine and her family. They are leaving Guam next month and beginning an adventure. For the next two years they will be cruising around in a boat, working down the West Coast, through the Panama Canal and the Caribbean, up the East Coast, and finally into the Great Lakes. They really want a website to share their adventures, location, information and photos with friends and family. I agreed to help set them up with something easy to use. For what they want to do, I think going with a TypePad site is probably their best option. Of course, it is also one of the more expensive options, but hey - she's a doctor and her husband is a banker. They can afford a few bucks a month for precious memories.

       A new development for Air America, the nation's liberal radio programming. The CEO of the fledgling company is stepping down to a smaller role in the company. In his place,  urlLink Beloit College  grad  urlLink David Goodfriend , currently legal counsel for the network, will become interim CEO, according to fellow Beloit College graduate Evan Montvel-Cohen.  The other big shake-up is the departure of the programming director, Dave Logan, a long time radio professional. His duties will be assumed by the network's morning show host, Liz Winstead. I like what San Francisco DJ Rick Stuart  urlLink has to say about this affair : "Doesn't seem like a good move and might be another sign of money problems dumping Logan and not replacing his salary. Clearly there was a rift with Walsh and Logan and other staffers. Do you think high paid comics take to programming direction well? Me neither."  Stuart also posts an article taken from the Chicago Tribune about the changes at the network, and focuses in on  urlLink Evan Montvel-Cohen :  With Walsh's departure, Cohen has become the liberal network's key spokesman and public advocate. He has an unlikely past for the role: He began his career as a Republican operative in his native Guam, serving as spokesman for Guam's Republican Party and as chief of staff for Sen. Tommy Tanaka, a pro-life Republican legislator.  Tanaka pleaded guilty to corruption charges last year.  'I am a progressive,' said Cohen, adding that Guam's political climate is quite different from the mainland's. 'Republicans in Guam are to the left of [late Democratic Senator] Paul Wellstone,' he said.

       Spent the day at Ypao Beach Park in Tumon, working the drink concession stand for the Beach Boys concert that Atkins Kroll put on. It was volunteer work, 50% of our sales go to the American Cancer Society. Unfortunately the beer ran out just as the Beach Boys took the stage. For the next three hours we had to deal with surly crowds bitching about the lack of beer. Seems traffic was so bad getting down into Tumon that the second beer truck couldn't make it down to the park.  Anyway, it was a fun afternoon listening to the Beach Boys and watching people get progressively drunker and stumble around. If I hadn't been working, odds are good I would've been stumbling around with them. And Guam certainly has no shortage of beautiful women. Seemed like everywhere I looked I saw bikinis today. And that's a good thing.  I'm pretty tired now. We were supposed to work four hour shifts, but somehow I got corralled into working all day, including set up in the morning and break down after the concert. My dogs are really barking right now. I think I will actually take a nice hot bath tonight before turning in early.

However, "EPA regulations do not apply in foreign countries, so no changes are being made to reduce the harmful environmental effects of the nuclear warheads."

       Here's some stories of interest in the last few days:   urlLink Mining Issue In Northern Marianas  - Seems a plan is afoot to lease  urlLink the island  of  urlLink Pagan  to an  urlLink Arizona mining consortium  interest in extracting the ash deposits that abound on Pagan. This has raised the ire of the former residents of Pagan, many of whom wish to return to the island, but are blocked by the government of the CNMI because the island is deemed unsafe since eruptions in the 1980's.   Ex-Pagan residents want to be consulted in mining venture    By Gemma Q. Casas Variety News Staff   FORMER Pagan residents are opposing moves to grant an Arizona-based investor the permit to mine and extract pozzolan from the volcanic island unless they are consulted and an environmental impact study on the proposal is made.  "Do not approve any mining activities on Pagan for Azmar or any other firm until all options have been thoroughly explored and an environmental impact study has been conducted. We urge you to be sympathetic to the needs of our people," said the members of the United Northern Mariana Islanders Association in a letter yesterday to Marianas Public Lands Authority Chairwoman Ana Demapan-Castro.  UNIA also criticized MPLA for holding a board meeting on Tinian to discuss Azmar's mining request.  Demapan-Castro and Juan Nekai were the only board members physically present during the meeting.  Board members Manny Villagomez and Benita Manglona reportedly "joined" the meeting through teleconference.  "The MPLA board's decision to hold its meeting on Tinian...to discuss commercial mining interests on Pagan is outrageously irresponsible. Many of us are wondering why Tinian? Just how many former residents of Pagan and the other Northern Islands actually live on Tinian that you know of?" UNIA stated in its letter to Demapan-Castro.  The Arizona-based firm of Azmar International wants to mine pozzolan ash on Pagan.  Pozzolan is said to have a very strong adhesive quality ideal for creating cement. Azmar said it is willing to infuse at least $40 million in capital to begin the mining of 4.55 million metric tons of pozzolan a year.  Azmar pledged to give MPLA a royalty fee of 3 percent for every metric ton extracted in addition to business gross receipt tax and ad valorem tax. UNIA told MPLA's board that it would be an "injustice" if the permit is granted without their members being consulted.  "How would you feel if you and your people were forced from your homes by a natural disaster? How would you feel if you and your people begged to return home but were told year after year that you don't belong there anymore? How would you feel about being treated like second-class citizens by your own government officials?" UNIA members told the board.  Members of UNIA were forced to leave Pagan when the volcano there erupted in 1981.     urlLink Last Dive For WWII Veteran  - 86 year old veteran Tomimatsu Ishikawa dove the wreck of the oil tanker Iro in Palau. On March 30, 1944, Ishikawa was the chief engineer onboard the oiler when it was bombed by U.S. forces in Operation Desecrate One. Ishikawa survived the airstrike, though the rest of the engine room crew were slain. He is now the last living survivor and dove the wreck on the 60 th  anniversary of the sinking.  Eyewitness Account of Typhoon Sudal - I wanted to post this story up before it is gone from the  urlLink Marianas Variety  web site  Eyewitness: 24-hour nightmare in Yap    By Olivier Wortel For Variety   YAP - Starting as a tropical storm off Chuuk and heading toward Guam and then abruptly cutting south and down toward Palau before moving southeast, Typhoon Sudal made an unwelcome stop over Yap, pounding the island mercilessly for nearly a day and leaving the worst devastation in its wake that this FSM state has seen in recent memory.  With sustained winds at its peak of 140 knots per hour and gusts up to 170 knots, with maximum significant wave height estimated at 36 feet, Sudal destroyed 99 percent of Yap's power, water and communications infrastructure.  Hundreds of people are living in schools, shelters, community houses and other government buildings, their homes completely ripped from their foundations.  According to an eyewitness report: "Yap got blasted. Typhoon Sudal rolled right over poor little Yap, and smashed it. Ninety-five percent of all residences destroyed. People are living in schools, shelters, community houses, and other government buildings. The vegetation is severely stressed. A 24-hour nightmare."  As of Sunday afternoon, April 11, only the disaster command office had a working telephone line, but efforts were being made to re-establish phone connection to at least some phone lines. Sudal's powerful winds crushed nearly all power and phone lines.  The same witness described some of the destruction left by Sudal: "Winds up to 155 mph. Seas at 30 feet. One of those moved the  urlLink Manta Ray restaurant  to its new location, almost on top of the new Waab hardware. This place is hurtin'. The people are handling it real well, for the time being. I'm sure the shock of it will hit in a day or so. Most are lucky to be alive, and know it. I've never seen anything like it. We stayed at the house, and rode it out in relative comfort. Scared all right, but safe. The house held up real well. We are very fortunate." Reports indicate no death or serious injury as a result of the typhoon. Thankfully,  urlLink help is on the way .  urlLink Potable water  seems to be what is  urlLink needed most . It's funny though, how some people can still find time to  urlLink bitch and moan .

       Spent most of today manhandling furniture around my apartment. Dresser goes here, tv goes there, empty out this closet here, move the entertainment center there. I'm a little worn out and hungry. But I don't feel like cooking. Guess it's time for a  urlLink run to the border .  As for the home redesign, I got a couple more pieces of furniture to move around and then moving all my books from one room to another. I'm not looking forward to that - I got lots of books.

       Last week we got new long distance calling cards at work. At the time I groused about switching for no apparent reason to a different company. Turns out there was a valid reason;  urlLink MCI is exiting the Guam market  on May 31, 2004. They are retiring their voice switch on that date, and not installing a new one. Though the article does not mention it, I imagine they will remain in the data circuit business.  When I first arrived on Guam, MCI was a major player in long distance. Back then, long distance rates were astronomical, something like $3 - $4 a minute. I rarely made calls home back then, but when I did, I used MCI. MCI is still a major player in long distance on Guam, so I suspect the decision to terminate the voice business lies with MCI's global troubles and much publicized bankruptcy. This is an inconvenience for Guam customers, but the long distance business is full of competing companies right now.

Today the ultra-right wing, in both religion and politics, has abandoned that principle of Jesus Christ’s ministry.

       At least the Saipan Tribune gets the idea of permalinks.   urlLink CNMI, Guam face betel nut shortage

        I was going to give a hyperlink to this story, but the Marianas Variety doesn't understand the concept of permalinks.    urlLink Marianas Variety On-Line Edition :  Prices of betel nuts have more than doubled    By Gemma Q. Casas Variety News Staff   PRICES of betel nuts in the CNMI have more than doubled due to the ban on imports from Guam and fears of a possible shortage of betel nuts after Typhoon Sudal struck Yap.  Betel nuts now sell 25 cents a piece or $1 per package of four, said Isidro Cabrera, agricultural consultant of Northern Marianas College's Cooperative Research, Extension and Education Service.  Before the ban, a piece of betel nut cost 10 cents or lower.  Cabrera said the CNMI produces approximately 4.8 million betel nuts a year. Yet it still imports about 100,000 betel nuts from Yap every month and several thousands from Guam.  But since last week, betel nuts from Guam had been banned due to the fungal infection plaguing the island's southern betel nut farms.  The ban will last until August, unless extended or rescinded.  "If Guam continues to have a declining production because of the disease that it is experiencing nowadays, it's going to be a big problem for betel nut chewers. Another big problem right now is Yap. Yap supplements the betel nut consumption of the CNMI but as you know, it was struck by a typhoon," Cabrera told reporters.  "Unfortunately, with the big typhoon that came to Yap, I don't think we will get enough supply of betel nuts," he added. Guam's betel nuts are said to be affected with a fungal infection called phytophthora meadii that thrives in rainy weather and can be carried by the wind.  The fungus can easily wipe out an entire plantation of betel nut trees in a short period of time, said Cabrera.  Those who violate the emergency ban face $100 to $1,000 civil fine or a criminal penalty of up to $2,000 or six months in jail or both.   Inspection   Because it is the nearest CNMI island to Guam, Rota's betel nuts will be inspected, Cabrera said.  "We have to make sure that the betel nut trees there are not infected," he added. "If they (are infected) at least we could do something to prevent it from spreading to other islands."  Cabrera said the Department of Lands and Natural Resources and NMC-CREES are collaborating on this survey, which is set for the next two weeks. DLNR said should the disease spread to the CNMI, there is no method to control it other than to cut down the infected trees and burn them.  Growing betel nut trees is a thriving industry in the CNMI.  Cabrera said about 55 percent to 65 percent of the local population chew betel nuts.  "Every year, more people chew. Small kids learn it from adults. Culturally, we will never stop it," Cabrera said.  It takes about six months to harvest fruits from a betel nut tree, Cabrera said. Thus, sellers import from Guam and Yap during the lean period to keep up with local demand.  Palau also used to export betel nuts to the CNMI but it has stopped to meet the island nation's own demand.  Although growers only harvest betel nuts twice a year, it still brings in profit. Cabrera said a piece of land with 2,000 betel nut trees can bring in an income of $50,000 to $60,000 a year.  Scientific studies show chewing betel nut could lead to diseases, especially when it is mixed with lime, pepper leaf and tobacco.  (With reports by Haidee Eugenio)

        urlLink Typhoon Sudal is a massive storm now , with winds of 150 mph and gusts to 190 mph. Thankfully it is expending its fury on nothing but the waves, whirling about in Philippine Sea.  urlLink The storm track  places it well away from any further human habitation as it spins poleward over the next week. Good riddance.  For the people of Yap though, it is an unmitigated disaster. Telephone, power and water systems all took heavy damage in Kolonia, the capital city of Yap, and the roof of the hospital was severely battered too. Emergency officials from FEMA are on Yap after a Coast Guard C-130 flew down yesterday.  urlLink Relief aid arrived in Yap  yesterday too, and  urlLink more relief flights  are scheduled by the Ayuda Foundation and Continental Micronesia. At this point it is hard to assess damage in the outlying areas because the roads are impassable and communications are down. It was a nasty storm for Yap, and they are going to need lots of help to get back on their feet. I understand completely, typhoons are terrible things, and living conditions in the aftermath are difficult.   HOW TO HELP  Relief supplies and donations will be accepted at the following place:  The Ayuda Foundation in Tiyan will be open this weekend. Call Ayuda at 671-473-3003.  The Office of the Consulate General of the Federated States of Micronesia will open Monday. Call the consulate at 671-646-9154.

       Today is the last day for a special exhibit of photos taken by  urlLink Horace Bristol .  urlLink Bristol  was one of the original photographers for LIFE magazine, and is well known for  urlLink his photographs of WWII . The exhibit, sponsored by the  urlLink Guam Humanities Council , features a set of never before exhibited photos taken by  urlLink Bristol  on Guam in 1944. He took the photos just a month after the  urlLink liberation of the island  by US forces. The exhibit  urlLink ran for a couple months , first at the Infiniti Gallery in Upper Tumon and then in an available store unit at  urlLink GPO .  I waited until the exhibit moved to GPO, primarily because viewing at exhibit at a shopping mall seemed a bit more pleasant than going to a car dealership to look at pictures. The photos were excellent; prominent position was given to Bristol's  urlLink "Grapes of Wrath" photos , which  urlLink served  as the basis for  urlLink Steinbeck's classic novel . I found the Asian photos much more interesting, particularly  urlLink Japan in the post-war years . And the war pictures provided some of the best photos, like this one below.       This small reproduction doesn't really do the photo justice. The man is stark naked and surrounded by the steel, plexiglass and weaponry of a warplane. On the actual print you can see he is drenched in sweat, which is probably why he is stripped naked in the belly of the beast. A look at the caption offers some explanation, Rabaul was in New Guinea so the heat was probably intense sitting in tropical sun of the blister gun.  Tucked in a back corner of the exhibit, behind the war pictures, was the prize of the collection: Bristol's never before exhibited photos of Guam, taken in August of 1944, only a month after US forces recaptured the island from the Japanese. Bristol only spent a couple days on the island, but he managed to get photos of the ruins of Agaña shelled into oblivion by the US Navy prior to the invasion, kids playing baseball in Agat, families building emergency huts out of nipa palm fronds, and the people of Talofofo village getting their first beef since the Japanese occupation. The photos were found by Bristol's son after his death in 1997, and this is their first exhibition.

       The PDN ran a story today about  urlLink Guam's image boost  with the military. And that's no fluke. Check out the  urlLink New York Times article  (sorry, password required) about Rumsfeld's interest in developing Guam as a larger base of operations. A rotation of B-52's was recently deployed to the island, and more development is planned. "Away for more than a decade, the B-52's, the United States' largest bombers, are back in Guam, part of a wide-ranging drive by the Pentagon to make this island, an American territory, a 'power projection hub' on the edge of Asia."  Ten years ago people were clamoring for the military to get out of Guam, tourism was the wave of the future. Now the local government and businesses are pushing the case for more bombers, a fighter wing, and even a carrier group to be stationed here. Guess eight years of economic stagnation will send you mewling for the government teat.

        A new and disturbing development in Iraq. In the past week the violence escalated from ambushing and murder of four civilian security force contractors into full scale battles between US forces and Iraqi militia. And now a previously unknow group, the Mujahideen Brigade, has taken  urlLink three Japanese civilians hostage  in southern Iraq and demanded the immediate withdrawal of all Japanese Self-Defense Forces in Iraq, or the hostages will be killed.  On Al-Jazeera, an announcer read a statement he said came with the video declaring a three-day ultimatum for Japan to announce its withdrawal of troops.  "Three of your sons have fallen into our hands," the announcer read. "We offer you two choices: either pull out your forces, or we will burn them alive. We give you three days starting the day this tape is broadcast."   Let's repeat that again,  urlLink they are going to  burn them alive  .   urlLink The BBC's Jonathan Head , in Tokyo, says that in safe and orderly Japan, pictures of three terrified Japanese civilians being held hostage by a group calling itself the Mujahideen Brigades are a source of nationwide anguish.  Television networks repeatedly aired dramatic video of the two aid workers Noriaki Imai, 18, and Nahoko Takato, 34, and photojournalist Soichiro Koriyama, 32. " Armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, the kidnappers shouted "Allahu akbar" -- God is great -- in the video and held knives to the throats of the Japanese, who screamed and whimpered in terror."  In a seperate incident, two Arab residents of east Jerusalem -- one an Israeli citizen working for a U.S. aid group -- and seven South Korean Christian missionaries were also detained Thursday, though the Koreans were released.  The South Korean missionaries were stopped by armed men at a checkpoint on a highway from Amman, Jordan, to Baghdad. The eight Koreans were traveling in two cars to attend the opening of a missionary school near the northern city of Mosul, Seoul officials said.  The gunmen dragged seven of the missionaries from the vehicles and seized their passports. The eighth said she escaped when the Iraqi driver of her car drove off before she could get out.  Iraq is not on the road to demcracy,  urlLink it is slipping into chaos . Pitched battles between US forces and militias, almost daily bombings of 'soft targets' like the UN, and now aid workers being taken hostage so they can be  burned alive ; it doesn't sound like democracy to me. Sounds like the situation is rapidly escalating out of control.

       Typhoon Sudal passed well  urlLink south of Guam yesterday . In fact, the storm veered to the southwest and is not bearing down on the main islands of Yap. The typhoon will pass over Ulithi sometime this afternoon, and that is not a good thing. When I was in New Zealand last November, Typhoon Lupit followed a similar storm track and wreaked havoc on Ulithi on November 25 th . The island is still recovering from that disaster.  Guam never got much of the storm though, and the sun is shining again today. I took the shutters down last night and enjoyed the fresh breeze throughout the house overnight.

So I am planning on enjoying a bit of this momentous event that no living person has seen before. I could go to India in a couple months - or maybe China.

       I finally saw  urlLink  The Passion Of The Christ   yesterday. I figured I needed a little religion on Palm Sunday.   Well, it was bloody. Bloody bloody bloody. The scourging was particularly brutal, with bloody spraying everywhere, and gobs of flesh being torn from Christ's back. He looked like a piece of meat after that.  Anti-Semitic? Well, the Jews are certainly not portrayed in a positive manner. The priests, King Herod, the crowd of hook nosed peasants braying for Christ's blood. Not a great day for inter-faith relations. The Roman centurions are not much better, showing a sadistic glee in tormenting Jesus. However, pains are taken to portray Pontius Pilate in a positive light, showing time and again that he did not wish to condemn Jesus. And several of the centurions executing the crucifixion behave humanely, stopping torments or allowing the Virgin Mary to weep at her son's feet. I'm pretty sure the Roman that impales Jesus with his lance is weeping at the end of the movie, while the Jews are wailing and gnashing their teeth as the temple is split asunder. Not exactly a veiled subtext there.   It was also a chance for me to flex the memories of my Catholic upbringing and that oh-so-useful art history degree I graduated with. 'Look! Mel Gibson's recreated the  urlLink  pieta  !'  All told, I don't think it is a bad movie, but I don't think it's a great movie either. It is pretty one dimensional; the god-awful suffering Christ endured for mankind's sins. Mel Gibson tells a simple story of blood sacrifice, and his fetish with blood, pain and torment is disturbing. Thinking back, he has always been an actor obsessed with torment and pain.  urlLink Mad Max  is beaten to a pulp, he gets tortured numerous times in the  urlLink Lethal Weapon  movies, and William Wallace achieves his apotheosis on the rack in  urlLink Braveheart .  I prefer  urlLink  The Last Temptation of Christ  , or even  urlLink the flawed movie adaptation by Martin Scorsese . They both offered a more interesting interpretation of the Passion and suffering of Christ, his life and the nature of divinity. Is that blasphemy? It was certainly a more respectful and insightful exploration of Jesus than  urlLink Gore Vidal's  attempt. But both approach the idea that Christianity is as much the teaching of Jesus as it is the proselytizing of Paul to the Gentiles. Gibson's interpretation of the Passion unwittingly reflects that. The Gospels were written to appeal to a certain audience, specifically Roman converts. Pains were made in the Gospels to portray Romans in general, and Pontius Pilate in particular, as bystanders forced by the blood thirsty Jews into the slaughter of the Messiah.   I think Kanzantzakis'  The Last Temptation of Christ  is a marvelous book, one that prompted me to read Scripture and try to gain a deeper understanding of Christ. Gore Vidal's  Live From Golgotha  sparked my reading into early Church history. But I doubt Mel Gibson's gore-fest will evoke such a reaction in me. The first two encouraged reflection and further study, the film bludgeons with a bloody fist.

       Looks like  urlLink I spoke to soon  about Myanmar releasing Aung San Suu Kyi. Now they are saying that the National League for Democracy (NLD) will be  urlLink invited to talks about drafting a new constitution  in May, and retracted  urlLink earlier statements  made by the foreign minister that Suu Kyi was about to be released from prison. The NLD, led my Suu Kyi, won 1990 elections by a landslide but the military junta refused to give up power. The Nobel Peace prize winner spent most of the last fifteen years under house arrest.

       Here's another shill job for this movie that starts filming on May 3.  urlLink 'Havoc' brings jobs  - upwards of 300 local people will be employed by this movie production.  I don't know. Somehow I am reminded of that  urlLink Simpson's  episode where a big Hollywood movie,  urlLink 'Radioactive Man' , is filmed in Springfield. I can sense the $$$$ in our leader's eyes. Anybody for a tax on puffy directing pants?

They were all really sick for quite some time, they stopped paddling for almost a month as I recall.

       Mobil Oil Guam  urlLink dropped their price per gallon  of gasoline 5¢ effective today, April 1. This is in response to the rollback on the Gross Receipts Tax from 6% to 4%.  I am happy to be paying less for gasoline, it sure seems suspicious that all the gas stations on Guam  raised  their prices by 5¢ last Friday, only to roll it back now that they are paying less taxes. Seems like they realized people were willing to pay $2.20 a gallon for gas so why not fix their prices at that level once the tax rate is reduced? What are we going to do - stop buying gas?

       Nice little piece on outrigger canoeing in Friday's NY Times -  urlLink The New York Times > Travel > Escapes > Journeys: Adventurer | Outrigger Canoeing   I've been think about getting back on a canoe lately, it's been far too long since I dipped my paddle in the ocean. I haven't paddled since the typhoons hit in 2002. I had so many other things to worry about at the time, and the crew just never got back together. Maybe I should gather up the team and see if anyone is interested in starting out again.  Since the Times only keeps the articles up for a week or so, I am copying it below. ON a balmy Saturday morning, it's practice as usual for the New York Outrigger Club. What this group of outrigger canoe enthusiasts hears is not the crashing waves of the Pacific or the whistle of cool Hawaiian trade winds, but the shouts and calls of tourists who wave frenetically from the deck of the Intrepid at Pier 86 on the Hudson River in Manhattan. As the paddlers battle uptown against the current and pull up alongside the Intrepid for a midmorning stretch session, curious onlookers on the hulking aircraft carrier show increasingly noisy interest.  They are finally greeted with a wave and a hello from the club's president, Di Eckerle, who rides in the six-person canoe's rear steersman's seat. A cheer goes up in reply, and Ms. Eckerle smiles. "Only in New York," she says.  Though Manhattan's waterfront is an unlikely place to find a thriving outrigger canoe scene - set as it is on a river whose obstacles include bobbing baseballs and soda cans, swells from the Circle Line ferries and gusts from choppers taking off and landing at the West 30th Street heliport - the club is a sign of the sport's growing popularity outside Hawaii. It is just one of close to 30 clubs in the East Coast Outrigger Racing Association, which was formed seven years ago. Besides Manhattan, outrigger clubs are found in unlikely spots like Massachusetts and Texas, as well as several West Coast places where the mild climate and proximity to Hawaii make for a firmly established Hawaiian transplant community.  The outrigger canoe - whose hull is attached on one side to a float, or ama, for added stability in rough open water - has been used for transportation in the Pacific for centuries. Contemporary outrigger canoe racing has its roots in Hawaii; according to Kanu Culture, an Australian-based magazine devoted to the sport, canoe racing was a form of entertainment and pride for Hawaiian villages. In 1908, the Honolulu-based Outrigger Canoe Club became the first such modern-day club to be founded in Hawaii.  The nonprofit New York Outrigger Club, founded in 1996 by Roger Meyer, launches its canoes from Pier 63, at 23rd Street and the Hudson near Chelsea Piers. The season runs from April to October, and practices are held on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and on Saturday mornings, which is when beginners can receive formal instruction.  "It's wonderful to see Manhattan from another point of view," said Ilana Lobet, 53, an Upper West Side resident who owns a custom-framing business. She began paddling in 2002 as a way to train for the Eco-Challenge adventure race in Fiji. "I've lived here since 1976. Out on the water, the scene is always different."  Manhattan is not as odd a location for a Hawaiian outrigger canoe club as it might seem, Ms. Eckerle said. "What's always struck me about Manhattan is that it's surrounded by water, but for many years no one thought to paddle on it. Though I must admit that we do have challenging currents and big motorized vessels that can be off-putting at times."  Across the country in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, where the San Francisco Outrigger Canoe Club hits the beach, outrigger canoeing has also adapted to its sometimes challenging environment. "It's actually very exciting to paddle here in the Presidio," said the club's president, Phil Siaris, who founded the club in 1988. "One thing you can always count on is the wind and fog, especially during summer evenings. But that's what makes it San Francisco." The club, one of the most established in the country, trains year-round and has 60 to 150 active members; the number tends to go up as summer approaches and the official race season progresses.  In New England, despite icicles during practices early in the season, the members of the Boston Outrigger Racing Association have a constant reminder of Hawaii: they launch their canoes from a place called Waikiki Beach. "The funny thing is, we paddled there for the entire first season before we even discovered the name of the beach, which has been around forever and ever," said the club's president, Joe McDougall, who founded it in 2001 to bring a small part of his family's Big Island history back to the Boston area. "When I saw that, I thought, 'We were meant to paddle here.' " Waikiki Beach is on Salem Sound, 20 miles north of Boston, and many club members commute from the city to practice.  For Laura Marlin, a longtime water-sports enthusiast who rowed competitively for more than a decade, there is something essential about outrigger canoeing that is missing from other paddle sports. "Particularly in New England, where the climate and landscape don't resemble Hawaii at all, it's the aloha spirit that sets the sport apart," said Ms. Marlin, who is an assistant attorney general in Massachusetts. "When teams from all over get together to race, there is a certain synergy among the paddlers that to me says 'aloha,' which can mean a lot of things in native Hawaiian: affection, love, regards."  Thirty-five miles southwest of Galveston, Tex., where the bay waters are often brown, members of the Texas Outrigger Canoe Club also try to transcend their physical surroundings. "Some people who have come from paddling in the islands find it really hard to relate to Hawaii here," said the club's vice president, Paul Dunham, who works for Continental Airlines. "You're just not in paradise in the same way." But despite that, he said, the harmony of the sport and the club's dedication to the roots of Hawaiian culture make it more than worthwhile. Each October, the club gets together with local Polynesian groups for the Aloha Festival in the Clear Lake area near Houston.  The attraction to community inherent to the sport is commonly expressed among most outrigger paddlers, no matter where they are from. "As far as other places - Florida or wherever - I just think it's great that they're perpetuating the sport of Hawaiian outrigger canoeing," said Mr. Siaris of the San Francisco club, who was born and raised in Honolulu. "They may be doing it a different way, but it's all in the same spirit of the sport. What I try to teach the paddlers is to have respect for the canoe and for each other."  That spirit and a bit of humor, too, also draw Mr. Meyer, of the New York club. "Every year we have a luau — and I do admit, we probably embarrass the culture a bit," he said. "Seriously, though, I'm not a big fan of watching people emulate what they don't understand. The most important thing to us is that there's a lot of soul involved in the paddling culture. The Hawaiian energy and spirit is what makes the sport so attractive - here, the first thing is always the connection, to one another and to the elements." By Bonnie Tsui

       I thought I'd toss out another couple links to continue the global warming theme today. Seems the  urlLink Arctic is actually melting faster than global warming predicts , possibly because of a feedback loop. Ice normally reflects sunlight, but once it melts, the exposed ocean water and land absorb a great deal more sunlight, which accelerates the ice cap's melting at a greater rate. Maybe Lovelock is right...  In other news, all that melting and global warming is going to lead to  urlLink less freshwater for human consumption . The American Southwest is currently in the grip of a long running drought, leaving water levels in Lake Mead and Lake Powell extremely low. In the foreseeable future, the Southwest might not be able to sustain its population, forcing all those Snowbirds and retirees into wetter climates.

       James Lovelock, creator of the  urlLink Gaia hypothesis , says that only  urlLink nuclear power can stop global warming now . All other conventional methods of energy production produce too much CO 2 , and renewable energy like solar and wind cannot meet the world's energy consumption needs and  urlLink global warming is accelerating at an unprecedented rate . Needless to say, green groups like  urlLink Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are not pleased with his analysis . But it certainly says something about our situation when one of  urlLink the first scientists to speak out about global warming , and an ardent ecologist, comes out and endorses nuclear fission as the only hope against the collapse of civilization under the effects of global warming.  And unlike a recent  urlLink Hollywood movie , this is not just  urlLink a lot of hot air  and silly special effects. The planet is warming up; glaciers are melting, ice caps in the Arctic and Antarctic are breaking up, low islands in the Pacific are becoming uninhabitable because of rising sea levels, heat waves and droughts... A seemingly unending litany of natural disasters pointing towards our planet becoming warmer and warmer.  Maybe what we need is a good old fashioned nuclear winter. I'm sure Dubya and his boys would be more than willing to launch a few dozen warheads, kick up a few megatons of fallout and dust to cool the planet a few degrees. Yee ha, stop global warming (excuse me, climate change) and teach those ungrateful Iraqis a little respect for freedom and democracy. Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

       I just got back from the American Cancer Society's Relay For Life. My company is the major sponsor for the event every year, and we had a whole contingent out in force tonight, walking around the track at G.W. High School. I answered a fundamental question of nature tonight: how long can a man bbq at the grill with nary a beer to drink? Turns out it was about two and a half hours before I said 'screw this' and passed the tongs off on another guy. I took a couple laps around the track, then I left. They will continue walking throughout the night, but I'll be back in the morning to help cleanup.

Did I mention she's the governor's cousin?

       Looks like George Lucas is  urlLink re-releasing  his first major studio film 1971's  urlLink THX-1138  in theaters along with a new DVD edition. This new version includes computer graphics of gigantic robot factories, and enhanced robot guards.  I just don't know what's wrong with this guy. Why does he have to tinker with all his old movies, adding in useless computer graphics? I remember what he did with Star Wars. The guy is agog with technology at the expense of story-telling, any idiot forced to watch the new Star Wars movies can see that.  I fully expect he will rework  urlLink American Graffiti  to include CG roadsters and a space battle or two. Or maybe he'll patch in Fonzie  urlLink jumping the shark .

       While  urlLink Seattle just opened  a fantastic  urlLink new $165.5 million library , the government of Guam cannot afford an additional $11,000 a year to hire an actual librarian to run the Guam Public Library. The government says that the library is not a priority right now, and  urlLink must wait for the economy to improve before much needed funding can be appropriated for the library system . While a recently passed law requires the library director to be a qualified professional librarian, the current $55,000 salary is too low to entice any professionals to the island. According to the Civil Service Commission, bumping the salary to $66,000 a year would make recruitment efforts much easier. For an additional $273,000 a year, the library system could afford to reopen four branch libraries in the villages of Merizo, Yona, Barrigada and Agat that closed over four years ago due to budget cutbacks and government furlough programs.  Recent media attention on  urlLink the long mothballed "Bookmobile"  program that quit running almost eight years ago spurred several private companies to donate their services and get the bookmobile back on the road. Matson Navigation really stepped forward in this project, repairing the bookmobile, donating $25,000 to fund the bookmobile program, and pledging continued servicing for the vehicle in the years ahead. Kudos also go to South Pacific Petroleum Company, for donating free fuel for a year to the bookmobile, and Chugach Support Services for prepping the main library building for painting.  Hopefully these public/private partnerships will spur renewed interest in the library, because it is in a terrible state. I've often said it, I was aghast at the library when I first came to Guam, and it still depresses me to visit the building: it looks like they haven't bought a book since 1973, the air conditioning didn't work for years, mold and mildew where everywhere, the stairwell was unpainted. Basically the place is a mess, and indicative of the poor state of education and cultural facilities on the island.

       At yesterday's Guam Economic Development & Commerce Authority (GEDCA) meeting, the  urlLink GEDCA board denied Max Havoc a bridge financing movie loan . The executive producer of the film, John Laing, said the bridge financing is no longer needed since principal filming is wrapping up on island. More pressing for the film's long term prospects is GEDCA's commitment to guarantee a $1.3 million loan. That loan has been held up because GEDCA has yet to sign off on the loan guarantee, and is a concern of the film's producers. ******* Speaking of that whole movie deal, former Congressman Robert Underwood wrote an  urlLink intelligent editorial on fiscal responsibility  in Sunday's paper which got in a couple digs at the whole idea of enticing movies to Guam. The impetus of his article was a recent visit to Yap, which despite catastrophic damage in last month's typhoon Sudal, is reluctant to use some of the $50 million in cash reserves the state government has accumulated through prudent economic policy. Wow, $50 million in reserve, saved from a yearly budget of $16 million. It would be like Guam having $1.5 billion on hand, instead of perennially running in the red year after year.  He attributes this deliberate and steady stewardship of the island's budget to betelnut. I am serious and I think the Yapese are as well. Chewing requires time to pause and reflect. Every decision is discussed slowly and sometimes endlessly with betel nut chewing almost a ritualistic part of the process. The Yapese are a conservative people who value their resources as a collective responsibility. They are not ostentatious, nor are they swayed by materialistic display. All of the governors are credited with saying, "If you have a dollar, you can only spend a dollar."   There is no public outcry for government to do things for them. In their recovery from Typhoon Sudal, they are grateful for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance, but there have been villages that turned back Red Cross assistance because it was aimed at only a few families and not the entire community. There are no senators making speeches about spending the money in the bank at this time of dire need. Communities have spontaneously formed work teams to ensure that everyone has some shelter and that the taro is harvested so that food will be available for at least two to three weeks.  When the Asian Development Bank recommended that the government work force be cut by 35 percent, Govs. Tun and Figir did more. The government work force went from 1,000 to 600. When crazy business ventures were proposed for government funding, they ignored them. No salmon farming or movie producing for them. Max Havoc can stay in Guam. Public works projects are limited and carefully scrutinized.  And the results are good. Out-migration to places like Guam and Hawaii is limited. The population is stable, there are reliable public services and there is money in the bank for a rainy day. They are actively discussing whether the recent typhoon qualifies as a rainy day. Imagine the kind of discussion that we would have in Guam if we had $50 million in the bank right now. It's an enjoyable and erudite essay from a distinguished educator and politician. More and more, I regret that Bob Underwood lost the election in 2002. I remember at the time there was a lot of bad blood around the election because the Gutierrez wing of the Democratic party refused to endorse Underwood, which probably cost him the election. I certainly never thought Felix Camacho would be elected over Underwood. As it panned out, he has certainly been a sub-par governor, with the acrimony between him and the  urlLink Lt. Governor ,  urlLink the legislature  and the  urlLink attorney general  growing every week. I wonder what Guam would be like today if Underwood had won the election? I know several people would say "Not a thing. Nothing would be different because that is the way of life on Guam." But then I think about how the world would be a different, better place if George W. Bush hadn't usurped the presidency from Al Gore in 2000. An election can make a world of difference.

       So I asked a friend of mine last week if he had a chance to look through  urlLink the picture album  I posted here two weeks ago. Y'all remember that photo gallery from  urlLink Dianne's birthday boat cruise ? He said he looked through it, but he wondered what  urlLink Donald Rumsfeld  was doing on a dive boat off the waters of Guam. That sparked my curiosity and I looked through my photos with a keener eye.  Lo and behold, I found him lurking in the lower left hand corner of  urlLink this picture ! Wow - well actually that's Mike Siegel, a member of the  Pago Bay Reefers  (more on them tomorrow). And he normally doesn't look like Rummy, but the resemblance in this photo is uncanny:           It's a little creepy, that's for sure. Besides nobody was being led around naked on a leash on the dive boat (at least from what I remember), so I'm pretty sure Rumsfeld had nothing to do with our little party.

One more reason to fly Northwest.  urlLink NWA Guam  had a great deal on fares to the States for one week only - $770 to the West Coast, $940 to the Midwest, $990 to the East Coast. Not bad, even if I needed to overnight in Narita on the way back. Tickets had to be purchased by yesterday, and travel needed to commence by June 19.

       The  urlLink Marianas Business Journal   (sorry, registration required)  ran a very interesting story earlier this month. Apparently local auto dealer  urlLink Atkins Kroll  is quietly selling millions of dollars worth of automobiles to a person in Helsinki, Finland. These vehicles, intended for the US market, are  urlLink being sold in Russia and other former Soviet bloc states  by the Finnish exporter, Aleksander Odrischinsky, and his company,  urlLink Catamount Oy . Government officials on Guam in mid-April began investigating this extraordinary trail of millions of dollars worth of luxury SUVs and sedans. The trail goes from Atkins Kroll on Marine Corps Drive, into shipping containers at the Port of Guam, on to Helsinki, via Korea, and across the Finnish border into Russia.  The reason that vehicles bound for Russia would need to be sourced from Guam was a mystery to Customs agents; however, a Toyota official in Helsinki explained that attractive U.S. prices and demand for certain hard-to-get models were the reasons for the Guam connection.  The Journal was unable to reach Catamount or Odrischinsky, but on April 27 spoke by phone with Vesa Tikka, general manager of Toyota Motor Finland Oy, which has 60 dealer outlets and a national office in Helsinki that sold 27,000 Toyotas and 50 Lexus vehicles in 2003. Tikka described Catamount as "a company that is selling cars to Russia - a small company that is very active in this, boats as well." Tikka said he thought Odrischinsky was managing director of Catamount. Vesa said the route to Russia through Finland is not unusual. "All Lexus and Toyota vehicles would be going through Finland, even if going to Russia."  Tikka said that the Lexus LX 470, GX 470 and RX 330s that were shipped from Guam to Finland in April are SUV models that are not yet available in Finland or Russia. He said the RX 330 will be available in Finland at the end of 2004. The April shipments from Guam also contained 20 Toyota Camrys, which in Finland each sell for about 35,500 Euros, the equivalent of about $42,000, compared to about $20,000 on Guam. Tikka said the shipments of new cars into Russia must be an issue for RussiaÂ’s authorized Toyota dealer. "This must bother the dealer in Russia. I can imagine, yes," Tikka said.  "He buys cars wherever he can find them," Tikka said of Odrischinsky. The whole thing is a little off color. Because the cars are not registered on Guam, sale of the vehicles does not register on monthly reports used by the Guam Automobile Dealers Association. When questioned by the Marianas Business Journal, AK management basically said their business dealings were nobody else's business. How long this arrangement has been going on is unknown, but it has caught the attention of Guam customs officials. Shipping documents show that Odrischinsky made shipments of 17 vehicles in February, 31 in March, and 50 in April. AK wouldn't reveal the number of cars sold to Odrischinsky, or say how long the large car buys had been going on, and the Journal was only able to look at a selection of shipping documents. Export figures from the Guam Department of Labor show that automobile exports in 2003 were $3.73 million, up a remarkable 84% from the previous year... Auto industry experts said the Toyota and Lexus vehicles going from Guam to Finland could be described as gray market vehicles. A gray market is a source of supply from which scarce items are bought for quick delivery at a premium above the usual market price, usually by a speculator. Guess AK struck upon a lucrative business deal. Too bad it looks like that gravy train is drying up. Toyota officials in Japan are looking into the deal, and are concerned because vehicles bound for the US have different emissions and safety specifications than those destined for Europe. And Odrischinsky doesn't seemed particularly interested in continuing to deal with Guam anymore either.  urlLink Contacted via telephone for an interview , Odrischinsky indicated that he would cease dealings with the island due to the 'unfavorable' article published on May 3 rd . He went on to claim that the vehicles are not bound for Russia, but would not divulge their ultimate destination. In fact, his quote is taunting. "I'm buying the cars, that's true. I'm a big exporter to the ex-Soviet bloc, that's true. But that's not the destination of these cars. I do export all over the world. These cars are not going to Moscow... You're on the right track. They come to Helsinki, but, there you've lost the trail," he said.  This sort of thing is hardly unique to Guam. Forbes ran an excellent article in April about  urlLink middlemen trafficking in US goods  through foreign markets, with the goods often ending up in countries subject to U.S. embargo, like Iran and North Korea. It is an enticing business, with the middlemen charging exorbitant fees for flipping cargo through intermediate ports like Dubai to these sanctioned destinations. "Interviews with private business people and U.S. officials, along with court documents, reveal a simple scheme. Companies located around the world sell goods--from cigarettes to medical devices and PCs--to buyers in the U.A.E. Dubai traders repackage the items and send them along by air or ship to agents in, say, Tehran, Pyongyang, Damascus or Islamabad." Forbes highlights the more dangerous end of this illicit trade, with innocuous parts designed for medical equipment being repurposed for nuclear weapons development. Apparently Pakistan's  urlLink Abdul Qadeer Khan , who created that country's nuclear weapons, used this process to seed countries around the world with prohibited technology to further their nuclear ambitions.  Now, I'm not saying shipping overpriced SUV's to Finland is comparable to sowing the dragon's teeth of nuclear weaponry to rogue nations, but it is part of the same continuum. And the primary motivator is both cases is money - a desire to increase profits at the expense of someone or something else. AK can say what they want about their business dealings, but they made a decision to ship their Toyotas to a foreign market,  on a fellow Toyota dealer's territory , in order to make a quick buck. It might not be illegal, but it certainly presents an ethical challenge.

        urlLink Yap braces for storm that may become typhoon - guampdn.com  Less than six weeks after getting hit by the one of the most destructive typhoons in its history, Yap and its outer islands face the possibility of getting hit by another storm.   A tropical storm formed over the weekend and is expected to pass right between Yap and its southern outer island Ngulu -- similar to the route taken by Typhoon Sudal on April 9, said National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Middlebrooke.   As of yesterday afternoon, the tropical storm's sustained winds had reached 45 mph, and the storm, though still fairly weak, was forecast to possibly strengthen into a typhoon as it passes Yap today, Middlebrooke said. The typhoon poses no danger to Guam or other Mariana Islands. As of this morning, the storm was packing winds of 60 knots (69 mph). The  urlLink updated storm track  has the center of the storm passing directly over the main islands of Yap this afternoon. This is not good for the island, especially since so many are still homeless and living in tents.

       Well that typhoon that popped up west of Palau late last week is currently tearing up  urlLink the eastern coast of the Philippines . Supertyphoon Nida is packing sustained winds of 140 knots, with gusts to 170 knots. For the landlubbers, that is plenty nasty. That translates too sustained winds of about 161 mph with gusts to 195 mph.  Hot on the heels of Nida comes another tropical depression resolving itself into a tropical storm. Tropical Storm 6W is currently 542 miles south/southwest of Guam and tracking to the northwest. Current storm track has it passing just south of Yap in about a day, just as it strengthens into a typhoon. Winds are currently sustained at 40 knots, with gusts to 50 knots.  I hope the storm bypasses Yap, the islands are still reeling from Typhoon Sudal. So many storms so early in the year is not a good sign though. I got this feeling 2004 is going to be a bad one for typhoons.

       I guess it's time to post a few photos from recent outings. A coworker is leaving island this month, which was the impetus for series of happy hour get togethers with the office buddies. Here's a few photos from those evenings   Sam Choy's  First off, here's a few photos from a couple weeks ago at  urlLink Sam Choy's  in Tumon. We ended up with a pretty big crowd, even though it was a Tuesday night.     Here's Jesika, the woman of the hour, with her husband Rich.    A group photo, but most people are in darkness at the rear.    Here's Darryl, who took most of these photos, and Liz.    That's Christine making some point or other, with Bob smiling behind her.    Cheers! That's my Heineken just left of center.    Christine's laughing pretty hard because I just grabbed her tongue a moment before.   Well that's all the photos I'll post from Sam Choy's. It was a fun night, but it broke up early. Probably best for a work night.   Quiz Nite  Last Thursday was Quiz Nite, a fundraiser for  urlLink Habitat For Humanity . My company bought tickets for two teams and I got asked to join one team. Quiz Nite was held at the  urlLink Marriott . I brought my camera and took some photos.     Here's some of my team, the Pacificare Polymaths. Mary Kleschen, G'nette Datu and Jesika Zellner.    Another photo of our team, but with me tossed into the mix.    Marketing manager Gus Sablan gets our drink orders.    And here's our other company team. Patrick, Joe, Maricon, Flom, Joan, & Clarence.    My team again, with the late arriving Al Almira.    We ended up in fourth place, and we each took home a bottle of wine. Not bad.   Well that's enough navel-gazing for now. I got some more pictures, including a surprise dinner I ate tonight, but I'll keep that for tomorrow. Till then, goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.

        I've been meaning to talk about this story I read over on  urlLink Kuro5hin  a couple weekends ago, the  urlLink Birth of a label-sanctioned pirate radio station . I skimmed over the introductory paragraph at first, and then I realized the author was talking about  urlLink KSHE 95 !  I guess you had to grow up in St. Louis to understand the power of KSHE. It was the  urlLink quintessential rock radio station , regularly  urlLink playing rock  that the other stations in St. Louis wouldn't touch with a ten foot pool. Aphrodite's Child, Brownsville Station, Foghat, Ozzy Osbourne, the list goes on and on. KSHE wasn't afraid of playing the long songs either, like  In-a-gadda-da-vida  or  Careful with that axe, Eugene . Every Sunday night KSHE played the  urlLink Seventh Day , an entire album uncut and without commercials. It was heaven.  I feel a close connection to KSHE. I grew within spitting distance of KSHE's studios,  urlLink a crappy little house in Crestwood  butted up next to the Route 66 Drive-In on Watson Road. This was about a mile from my house and I passed it almost everyday. To me the sitcom  urlLink WKRP In Cincinnati  was inspired by the story of KSHE,  urlLink a small station  turning from an easy listening format to progressive rock overnight, with a crazy collection of DJ's and loonies running the place. That was KSHE.     KSHE's mascot was a pig wearing shades and dangling a smoke from his lips. Sweet Meat showed up on everything, bumperstickers, frisbees, hats, t-shirts. KSHE still sells Sweet Meat stuff, but somewhere along the line he lost the cigarette.  I don't listen to KSHE anymore. For a while they streamed audio over the internet, but that stopped several years ago. They moved from Crestwood ages ago too. Now they are located in Union Station in downtown St. Louis, and the Route 66 Drive-In is a Best Buy store with a mammoth parking lot. I'm not sure what they play these days, but I hope to God it's still Real Rock Radio.  Somewhere in the late 80's, the brand of rock that KSHE played became "Classic Rock." Perhaps it was a sign of the times, or maybe just the maturation of the format, I don't know. At the time it seemed like KSHE was relegated to playing nothing but Doobie Brothers and Creedence. My musical tastes were broadening, and I branched out to KDHX and the wild wooly world of community radio.  We got a rock station out here in Guam, eponymously called  urlLink The Rock . It's not bad, but it plays a too much new stuff instead of the rock I grew up listening too (a  classic  sign I am getting too old). Instead I spend most of my time listening to  urlLink KPRG , Guam's only public radio outlet, which plays a steady stream of jazz, folk, classical and alternative indie rock, along with a couple jammin' shows that remind me of KSHE in its heyday.  Still, I occasionally find myself pining for the radio of my youth, KSHE 95 Real Rock Radio and the memories it evokes. The music was good and even back then I realized how special that radio station was. The only comparable connection I have to the music of my youth is to Streetside Records, which was the epitome of a record store to me and my generation. But that great store over by  urlLink Webster University , less than a mile from my house and chock full of great music, closed down over a decade ago and moved to a generic strip mall store out in Crestwood. But I'll save that for another day I guess.

       This thing just appeared out of nowhere. Yesterday there was no storm, just a long line of disturbed weather in the Western Pacific. Today, a tropical storm  urlLink coalesced out of the disturbance  west of Palau. It poses no threat to Guam or even poor Yap, but I am amazed at how quickly this thing formed and developed into a tropical storm. People in the Philippines better watch out, it's heading directly for Luzon.  The  urlLink satellite loop  shows lots of feeder band activity in Palau. Weather reports from the Palau airport indicated steady rain, increasing in intensity over the last day. I'm sure it will dwindle off at the storm heads off to the north.  Mainly I am worried that 2004 will be another year for typhoons, and that Guam will be struck again, just like in 2002. I really don't want to go through that again, I shudder just to think of it.

        Thursday marked  urlLink another milestone  for aerospace pioneer Burt Rutan and his company  urlLink Scaled Composites . The company's privately designed and funded spacecraft, SpaceShipOne, flew it's  urlLink third power flight  on May 13 th , reaching a height of 212,000 feet. This is within striking distance of 329,000 feet, the threshold of space required to claim the  urlLink Ansari X-Prize .  To claim the prize SpaceShipOne needs to reach 329,000 feet with two paying passengers, return to Earth, and repeat the process within three weeks. Scaled Composites has issued no timetable, but they are widely expected to attempt to reach space and claim the X-Prize next month.  Sign me up, I've always wanted to visit space.

       Well not exactly. More like despoilers of the exposed road project. More than a year after uncovering an ancient Chamoru burial site on the Route 4 highway project in Yona, it is apparent that  urlLink the ancient remains at the Ylig site were destroyed by exposure to the elements . Wind, rain, landslides and feral dogs destroyed the bones that were unearthed last year, while the Department of Public Works frittered and wasted time looking for an archaeological firm that would do the work pro-bono.  There is a public meeting today at 5:00 pm in the Yona community center to discuss this mess, and the never ending road project that was stalled by the discovery of the remains. While the road is entirely paved up by my house (at last!) nothing has been done at the bottom end of the project since the backhoes dug up the burials in April 2003.

It looked totally different when I posted that bit about the space plane than last night's post about boat charter and photo album.  I'm not at all sure I like it, the old layout served me well and it had a simple, yet stylish design. This new one has a distinctly kindergarten feel to it, with the big, oversize buttons and rounded text. My first reaction is "Blah, who designed this crappy layout?" But it looks like there are some new features and whatnot, so I guess I can get used to this new infantile look.

"Begin agitation phase," the film maker announces as the poor sap enters the circle of lions. That got a chuckle out of me.  I just saw another one this morning. Two suburban dads out in the backyard trying to get rid of an enormous swarm of bees by cutting the branch and dropping the swarm into a trash can. Of course dad #1 trips off the ladder and falls right onto the swarm, sending dad #2 skittering across the yard and into the lit bbq pit. I couldn't stop laughing at that one.

       I'd like to say I didn't expect this, yet somehow I knew it was going to happen.  Evan Montvel-Cohen and Rex Sorenson resigned from  urlLink Air America Radio  this week according to a story originally  urlLink reported by the Chicago Tribune   (sorry, registration required) . The  urlLink AP picked up the story  and  urlLink several media outlets  are carrying it now. But the original Chicago Tribune article is more in depth, revealing deep troubles at the fledgling network.  Chairman, partner leave Air America   By John Cook Tribune staff reporter  Published May 7, 2004   In yet another sign of trouble for Air America Radio, the liberal talk network's co-founder and chairman, Evan Cohen, resigned Thursday along with his investment partner and vice chairman, Rex Sorensen.  The company also failed to make its scheduled payroll Wednesday, leaving its staff of roughly 100 writers and producers unpaid until Thursday.  The radio network has been on the air for only five weeks. On April 30, it was pulled off Chicago's airwaves because of a payment dispute.  "We're on a wild ride," said Jon Sinton, the network's president, acknowledging that Air America has suffered "the typical bumps and bruises faced by any start-up."  "But the bottom line," he said, "is that we are on the air to stay."  The departures of Cohen, a former Republican political operative from Guam who was among the network's initial investors, and Sorensen, an investor, mark the second executive shake-up at the fledgling network in as many weeks.  Last week, co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Walsh resigned (he remains a senior adviser), and programming chief Dave Logan was forced out.  Replacements for Walsh and Cohen have yet to be named. Asked when those positions would be filled, Sinton replied: "I wouldn't hold my breath."  Sinton said Cohen was forced to resign by investors unhappy with the way he handled a clash with Multicultural Radio Broadcasting Inc., owner of Air America's Chicago and Los Angeles stations.  After an acrimonious and public dispute, the two companies severed their relationship, leaving the network off the air in two of the nation's top three markets. (Air America remains on the air in 16 markets, including New York City.)  "I think that other shareholders were upset with the way that escalated so quickly," Sinton said. "I don't think that needed to be handled in such an argumentative fashion."  Cohen has previously said that Air America's investors include former broadcasters Thomas Embrescia and Norman Wain, TV pioneer Norman Lear, and Sheldon Drobny, the Highland Park entrepreneur who originally founded the company before selling most of it to Walsh and Cohen in November.  Sinton said he was unaware whether Cohen and Sorensen will retain their ownership stakes in the company. Cohen did not return phone calls.  Last week, according to two sources familiar with the matter, paychecks to some of the network's talent--a group that includes Al Franken, Janeane Garofalo, and Randi Rhodes--bounced, and Rhodes joked on the air about not being paid.  A scheduled payday for the staff on Wednesday came and went without checks, though the staff was paid on Thursday. Sinton chalked up both cases to "technical issues."  Copyright &copy 2004,  urlLink Chicago Tribune  I'd like to say I am surprised by this turn of events, but frankly I'm not. Hopefully Air America can survive and stay on the air.

        Stirling engines have been around for a long time. Almost two hundred years, in fact. Unlike internal combustion engines, Stirling engines are a closed cycle with no exhaust gases. The pistons are driven by gas that cycles between two cylinders as it is heated and then cools. Yet Stirling engines have never really caught on because of the power and low cost of internal combustion engines.  Now a Phoenix based firm is developing a solar power system that relies on a Stirling engine to produce electricity. Unlike photovoltaic cells which directly convert sunlight into electricity,  urlLink Stirling Energy Systems' Solar Dish Stirling  concentrates sunlight across a 37 foot dish onto a single focal point, a specially designed Stirling engine. The focused sunlight provides the heat to power the gas exchange cylinders in the Stirling engine. A single dish is capable of producing 25 kilowatts. The company estimates that an 11 square mile solar farm in the American Southwest could produce  urlLink as much electricity as Hoover Dam . A 100 square mile installation could solve the energy needs of the entire country. Wow.  This really caught my interest. The technology surrounding this system is decades old.  urlLink Originally developed by McDonnell-Douglas , the concept stagnated in the 1980's when oil prices were low. The idea languished for nearly a decade until Stirling Energy Systems started up and purchased the technology from Southern California Edison for $180,000. Stirling was founded by David Slawson in 1996 to acquire and develop the technology behind the solar generator. So far the company has raised about $15 million from private investors and has received additional funding from the U.S. Department of Energy.  The array of mirrors that covers the dish concentrates sunlight on an 8-inch opening. There, heat from the sun's rays runs a four-cycle engine that powers an electric generator. Stirling has acquired a license to manufacture the engines in the United States from Sweden's Kockums AB. Kockums initially developed the engine for use in Swedish submarines.  McDonnell Douglas Corp., Kockums and the Department of Energy developed the technology for the solar generator in the mid-1980s. McDonnell Douglas eventually sold the technology to Southern California Edison, which sold it, along with six prototype dishes, to Stirling.  Robert Liden, Stirling's chief financial and administrative officer, said the California utility lost interest in the dishes when the state limited the amount of research and development costs it could recover from ratepayers.  Liden noted that the technology was heralded in the 1980s as one of the most-efficient means to harness the sun's energy. Unlike photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity through a chemical process, the dishes do not become less efficient in hot weather.  And the Stirling units use no water, in contrast to so-called solar trough generators that use the sun's energy to produce steam to turn turbine generators.  But at a cost of $300,000 per unit, the Stirling generators are hardly cost-effective. They can produce electricity for about $1 per kilowatt, or 50 times more than power generated by the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, west of Phoenix, and 20 times more than that produced by a natural-gas generator.  But Liden notes that the first units, including the engines, are being built by hand. Stirling believes it can bring the cost down to about $25,000 per unit if they are mass-produced. That would make them competitive with conventional power plants, Liden said.  -From  urlLink  2 Phoenix firms to build generators  , The Arizona Republic, April 28 2004 I certainly hope this idea pans out. Renewable energy sources need to be developed if we ever want to cut fossil fuel emissions and stem global warming.

       Nothing major, just a nice photo of San Francisco taken yesterday by a  urlLink ESA  satellite,  urlLink Proba .  I circled my friend Annie's home, or at least the whereabouts of her house. The resolution isn't fine enough to pick out the actual house, but the circle describes her block and immediate neighborhood.    urlLink

       I got up bright and early this morning, excited to catch the lunar eclipse. Well, I could tell there was an eclipse going on but the clouds prevented me from seeing it. There was no silvery brightness to the sky, like there was when I went to bed at 1:00 a.m. but I couldn't see anything on the western horizon due to heavy clouds. Alas, it was not to be. Guam was only going to catch the very beginning of the eclipse anyway, people in South Asia, the Middle East and Africa will have a much better view of the event.

       The first Russian museum of erotica is opening in St. Petersburg, and one of the exhibits on display is  urlLink the pickled pecker of Grigory Rasputin . Apparently the evil monk was extremely well endowed ( a man called horse  indeed) and after his death the genitalia were preserved for future generations to gawk at. I was going to post the picture of this monstrous organ, but my mother reads this weblog. Go and check it out for yourself, I'll wait...  The infamous holy man to the Tsarina was assassinated in 1916. I once read how they killed Rasputin in a book called  urlLink  The Grim Reaper's Book Of Day  . They lured him out to an isolated cabin with offers of sex with a young boy on December 31 st . Once there, several nobles fed him cakes laced with cyanide, bound him in ropes, cut off the penis in question, wrapped him in a burlap sack, bound it with chains, shot the bag with a pistol several times and tossed the sack through the ice and into the frozen Neva River. When his body was recovered, his bonds were broken and his lungs filled with water, proving he wasn't dead until he was tossed into the river. Crap, that was one hard motherfucker to kill.  And he had a really big schlong too.

       Top story in today's paper: GMH officials uncover evidence of  urlLink a scam using public assistance to get health care at the hospital . A woman was admitted to the hospital's maternity ward recently, the latest of several episodes of care for her at GMH under MIP, the  m edically  i ndigent  p rogram. She presented her Social Security Card and name and was admitted.  That's when hospital lab techs noticed a problem. During her previous confinement she had O- blood, but miraculously this time her blood type was A+. On top of that, her last hospital stay was for a tubal ligation, yet she was admitted to the maternity ward and delivered a baby.  "We think we may have uncovered a scam operation," said Bill McMillian, hospital administrator. Ya think so, Sherlock? A brilliant deduction there.

         I originally wrote this almost a month ago. I marked it as a draft and forgot all about posting it until this afternoon, when I cracked open that jar of Durkee's pictured on the left.   This is the best sauce in the world. It tastes so good on sandwiches. The flavor is like mustard and mayonnaise combined with a touch of horseradish, and it goes great on a BLT. Mmm, I'm making myself hungry just thinking about it.  Unfortunately,  urlLink Durkee's  is not available on Guam. I've searched high and low, but not a single store carries this ambrosia. I brought a jar back with me from my last trip back to Missouri, but that was back in 2002. I've been jonesin' for Durkee's for quite some time.  Which made today's events oddly serendipitous. Thinking about Durkee's Famous Sauce this morning, I decided to try Googling around for a web site that might sell me some Durkee's online and ship it out to me here. Curiously, I couldn't even find a reference to this wonderful sauce on the company website. Instead I found a plethora of sites offering  urlLink recipes for a faux Durkee's  I can create at home with common ingredients. Hooray!  Obviously my thoughts were projecting out into the neighborhood, because my next door neighbor came out of his house with a jar of the delicious and coveted sauce.  urlLink Kismet  I say. He just returned from a trip to Illinois over spring break (I never really thought about it, but I apparently college professors take off for spring break too), and he remembered a discussion we had about Durkee's back in February. I was over at his house helping him out with his Gateway and I noticed the jar on a shelf in his kitchen. We started talking about how good Durkee's Famous Sauce is on sandwiches and how we both smuggled jars of it back from the Midwest. When he was in  urlLink Urbana-Champaign  last week, he picked up a jar for himself and a jar for me too! I guess I will go ahead and install that extra RAM in his computer that he ordered a couple weeks ago. The lure of Durkee's is a powerful thing.  While it is good to have a jar of Durkee's back in my kitchen, I am also excited to try that recipe for the sauce I can make in my own kitchen. Then I will never be without this tasty sauce again. In case I forget the link, here is that recipe: Try this smooth copycat with your next steak.   1/2 c cold water  4 tbsp cornstarch  1/2 c + 2 tbsp dark vinegar  2 tbsp salt  1/2 c granulated sugar  1 egg  4 tbsp prepared mustard  4 tbsp margarine, cut into tiny bits  Combine all ingredients into a blender and blend until very smooth.  Empty blender into top of double boiler and cook over gently boiling water, stirring often for 12 to 15 minutes, until thickened and smooth.  Return mixture to blender and blend at high speed for 30 seconds or until smooth.  Put sauce into a covered container and refrigerate for 24 hours before using.  Stores up to 3 months, refrigerated. Mmm-mmm good. I wonder how it tastes with steak? Sounds like a challenge, especially as I could go for a nice steak tomorrow night. Would it be as good as  urlLink finadene  on steak? That's a tough combination to beat.

        The month of May is finally here, and Guam's moment to shine in the movies has arrived. Principal shooting for  Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon  begins next week, and already the positive effects are being felt in the community. Interest in the movie has  urlLink sparked many local high school students to look into the film industry as a career . I don't know if the stars of the movie ( urlLink Carmen Electra ,  urlLink Mickey Hardt ,  urlLink Qi Shu ) have arrived yet, but I suspect it won't be long now. Photography is scheduled to begin on May 10 th .   urlLink Locally hired production staff are hard at work on the film , and more hiring is expected as shooting gets under way. Over two dozen locals were hired as extras for the filming, and almost 300 jobs will be created overall by this movie. Guam can certainly use the extra income.  One interesting bit I learned is that virtually the entire movie is going to be filmed at the Outrigger Hotel in Tumon. That seems a little odd, but I guess it helps keeps production costs down. The newly redesigned  urlLink Palm Cafe  at the Outrigger will be converted into a lounge and a other sets.  This is the first film to be made on Guam since 1962's  urlLink  No Man Is An Island  , an adaptation of  urlLink George Tweed's   urlLink odyssey on Guam during World War II .  Here's a chance to visit the set of  urlLink Max Havoc, Curse of the Dragon , and rub elbows with the cast and crew. Hurry! Contest winners will be announced on May 6 th !

       Crap.  So I was at an after-work BBQ this evening, a going away party for this guy Darryl at work. He quit the company last Friday and he's moving back to Hawaii on Friday. The boys at the warehouse threw Darryl a party at one of the pavilions along Marine (Corps) Drive tonight, right past Alupang Tower Condos. There was a gang there and we had a blast. Lots of beer, a couple trucks bumping the tunes, good food and good time for all.  As the party started to break up, a couple of the boys suggested heading out to the bars, possibly a titty bar or two. "No, no," I said, "I need to head home and do some stuff around the house." I begged off despite repeated entreaties, and jumped in my car to head home.  I was a little drunk and I really wanted to just chill out, but by the time I got to Yona the damn power was out. Again. I arrived home to sit in a dark, sweltering house for over an hour until the power came back. Damn. Talk about a buzzkill.  I suppose I shouldn't be too angry, the power came back on at 10:00 p.m. Yet I am still angry. Eleven years I've lived here and still, on any given night, the power will go out. It's so damn frustrating.

       Before I consign  urlLink tropical storm Tingting  to the dustbin of my archives, how about a picture of my doctor fearlessly crossing the floodwaters on Route 4 in Pago Bay? I saw this photo in Monday's paper and I said "That's my doctor! He must be heading to the hospital for a medical emergency." Well he was just up here at our offices and I mentioned seeing the photo in the paper. He told me his wife and kids were in the car, screaming at him to stop. He turned back when the same section of road was flooded after Pongsona, but he figured if he was ever going to cross the expanse, that was the time. There were plenty of towtrucks waiting, plus the cameras from KUAM and photographers from the PDN.       I still haven't attempted crossing that flood. It's still there three days after the torrential rains. I am afraid the Blue Torpedo won't make it through the water since it is so low to the ground. I've been driving through Pulantat, bouncing along a gravel road up to Leo Palace, and then coming out in Ordot by Agueda Johnston middle school. The large portion of the road to Leo Palace is washed out and only one lane is passable in that part, but crews are working hard to repair the damage.

       Yesterday a man died from injuries he sustained during Tropical Storm Tingting on Sunday. He was in his car in Ylig Bay, just below where I live, when a  urlLink storm surge swamped his car .  A man was also swept over the reef in Tumon and has not been recovered.  urlLink Five kayakers were lost over the reef in Piti  yesterday as well. The surf is still wild from Tingting on the western side of the island. While search & rescue spotted three empty kayaks yesterday, no one has been recovered yet.

       Wow. That was worse than anybody expected. For a tropical storm,  urlLink Tingting  delivered a hell of a punch. My power went out last night around 1:30 a.m. and it just returned about 20 minutes ago.  urlLink Mudslides, flash floods, and almost 20 inches of rain  rattled the island yesterday. This is now the  urlLink wettest June ever recorded on island .  I was up all night mopping up wind driven rain that was pouring in through my front door - just like during Typhoon Pongsona 18 months ago. I really need to get storm shutters on my front door.  Anyway, the storm was upgraded to Typhoon Tingting this morning, and it is currently wreaking havoc on Saipan. The rains slacked off around 7:00 this morning on Guam and I was finally able to get some shut eye.  The roads into my village are impassable, with Pago Bay Bridge closed because of flooding, and Ylig Bay Bridge closed due to mudslides. It is possible to make it out through Pulantat and past Leo Palace, but the road in Ordot is flooded and impassable to everything but 4x4's. So I am sitting tight today, cleaning up my house and yard. At least the power came back on.  All told I feel lucky. Some people got  urlLink flooded out of their homes , and others found their homes  urlLink half-buried in mud and muck .  Here's the latest colorized satellite photo from NOAA:   urlLink     Tingting is the one on the right, just above Saipan. That other one with the well-developed eye is  urlLink Typhoon Mindulle , which was the source of last Monday's torrential rains.  And here's a photo I took yesterday afternoon of the wind and rain.      It was pretty wild and hairy yesterday. Ylig Bay is littered with downed trees washed onto the reef, and the silt washed down from Manenggon Hills stretches miles out into the Pacific.   urlLink

All flights have been diverted and emergency shelters are open in the schools for refugees.  urlLink Flash flooding  and  urlLink mudslides  are reported all over the island. In fact, the Route 4 just below me is closed because of a mudslide in the construction zone.   Between midnight and 7:00 p.m. over 13 inches of rain were recorded at the Guam International Airport.

       Okay, the power is still on, but I am getting some flooding in my house. Not from the windows - those are shuttered - but from my front door. It's got a 1/4 inch gap at the bottom and it is taking the brunt of the wind and rain right now.

       It's almost noon, and the weather is getting worse and worse. Constant rain, and the winds are easily 30-35 mph right now, with gusts closer to 40 mph. I closed the typhoon shutters around 9:30 this morning. I wasn't afraid of flying debris, just rain water leaking through the windows because of this sustained wind. Normally this kind of weather wouldn't affect the power grid, but  urlLink GPA struggled to keep the island electrified  this past week. I am worried the power will go out soon given  urlLink the system's instability . And that would suck, especially since I am doing laundry today.

       A quick linkfest to a couple NASA missions:   urlLink Cassini beams back new image of Titan  - Cassini sent back another amazingly detailed image of cloudy Titan this week, one of the best images of the planet-sized moon yet. Cassini is nearing a critical burn to enter orbit around Saturnian system later this week. If anything goes wrong, the probe will continue past Saturn and be lost in deep space. Let's hope seven years of space travel hasn't affected the rocket motor adversely. I am really excited about what new wonders Cassini will unveil at Saturn. It is an eerily beautiful world.   urlLink Mars rovers continue to impress  - The  urlLink Opportunity  rover continues a delicate traverse into Endurance Crater, uncovering new geologic layers in exposed rock, while  urlLink Spirit  explores the Columbia Hills. NASA really put together a couple amazing rovers. They both continue functioning, well after their 3-month expected lifespan, with only a few systems succumbing to the intense cold of the Martian winter. I never thought Spirit would make it to those distant Columbia Hills, but I was happily proved wrong. This extended mission helped paint a fuller picture of a wet, water soaked Mars that existed eons ago.

       Tropical Depression 11W intensified into a Tropical Storm yesterday, and  urlLink Tropical Storm Tingting is bearing down on the Marianas .  urlLink Current storm track  places it to the northeast of Saipan in about a day. Current position: 13.0&deg N 150.0&deg E, or about 350 miles east of Guam and moving to the northwest at 8 knots (~9 mph). Maximum sustained winds are 45 knots (52 mph), with gusts to 55 knots (63.25 mph).  It doesn't look like Guam is going to get hit at this point, but feeder band activity is pretty intense this morning. Saipan is going to get much worse as this thing intensifies. Time to go secure stuff in the yard, flip over the lawn tables, bring in the chairs and stuff before they go flying.

        urlLink Manenggon concentration camp survivor recounts war tragedy . One of the painful memories of WWII on Guam is the concentration camp that Japanese Army forced Chamorus into in 1944.  On July 10, 1944, Japanese Lt. Gen. Takeshi Takashina, who assumed command of the island in March 1944, ordered all Chamorros throughout the island -- men, women, children, the sick and the elderly -- evacuated from their villages and marched to concentration camps in the south. Many of the Chamorros were kept in a concentration camp in the Manenggon valley in Yona. A commemorative walk up the Ylig River valley to Manenggon will be held on July 10 th , culminating at the site of the former camp. The tribute kicks off a drive to construct  urlLink a memorial at the Manenggon site .

       One last post on the Enola Gay crewmembers visiting Saipan for the Liberation festivities. I think it is important to get this stuff down so others can read it. This article was the headline for Tuesday, June 15 in the  urlLink Marianas Variety .   Enola Gay trio visit after 60 yrs  by Ulysses Torres Sabuco  Variety News Staff   PAUL Warfield Tibbets came back to CNMI with just one wish: to "face" the people he helped liberate and "correct" whatever "bad impression" he may left from bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.  On Aug. 6 at exactly 9:15 a.m., Tibbets and his 11-man crew flew out of Tinian's Northwest Field to drop the world's first atomic bomb. It brought the quicker surrender of the Japanese government and the reduction in losses for the allied forces.  Tibbets will be part of today's commemoration of Northern Marianas's role in reshaping history.  Exactly 60 years ago today, the Battles of Saipan & Tinian took place, making these among the fiercest battles in the Pacific.  "I came here with (other Enola Gay crew and veterans). I wanted the people out here to see me and who I was because they have been here all of these years," Tibbets told Variety yesterday morning.  "And I hope if they have a bad impression of me, I could change it...," the retired brigadier general added.  Tibbets will keynote today's formal commemoration of the Battles of Saipan and Tinian, and was among the returning WWII veterans, including some of the Enola Gay crew, who will also be feted by the CNMI government today.  Among the returning WWII vets are Morris R. Jeppson, a crew member of Enola Gay, and Ray "Hap" Halloran, the American soldier who became a prisoner of war when his plane was shot down in Tokyo on Jan. 27, 1945.  In his address yesterday morning during the dedication of the Saipan time capsule, Gov. Juan N. Babauta hailed the contribution of the Enola Gay crew and other WWII veterans.   First plane ride  A decorated war veteran, Tibbets was only 12 years old when he had his first airplane ride. 10 years later, he enlisted as a flying cadet in the Army Air Corps at Fort Thomas Kentucky. A year later he got his pilot wings at Kelly Field, Texas and was commissioned as 2nd lieutenant.  At age 29, soon after flying over 25 missions, including the first American Flying Fortress raid against occupied Europe and the first bombardment missions in support of the North African invasion in Algeria, Tibbets was briefed on the "Manhattan Project" - the code name for the development of the atom bomb.  It was his responsibility to organize and train a unit to deliver these weapons in combat operations.  On Aug. 5, 1945, President Harry Truman gave his approval to use the atomic weapons against Japan.  Tibbets is back to a grateful commonwealth, proud by the reception he has received.  "I have been really (happy). I did not know what to expect... the reception was beyond my understanding," said the 89-year old former pilot.  He admitted that the "recognition is overdue" but is proud of what he accomplished.  "I am just happy to see this done for the people here and for the rest of the world... (the) recognition is overdue," he said.   Honored to be here  Morris R. Jeppson, assistant weaponeer of the Enola Gay is honored to be back in Saipan.  "We are honored to be here," Jeppson told Variety yesterday.  He said Saipan transformed into a "beautiful island" from what it was six decades ago.  "Saipan is a beautiful island now and we are delighted to be here," he said. "We are delighted to see what beautiful things are happening here in Saipan."  Meanwhile, Ray "Hap" Halloran said this might be his last time to visit Saipan, a place he "loves so much."  Halloran became a prisoner of war by the Japanese Imperial Army after his plane was shot down over Tokyo while eastbound at 32,000 ft. passing Mt. Fuji.  "I was here the last time (in) 2002. I was here seven times before that. but now in 2004, I came back at age 82... It may be my last trip," he said.  Halloran led an 11-man crew called the "Rover Boys Express" that flew the B-29 Super Fortress bomber on a combat mission to "bomb and destroy" Japanese mainland targets.  He was assigned to Saipan where the 73rd Wing Base was located. Halloran and the Rover Boys Express flew missions to Iwo Jima, Nagoya and Kobe in Japan in Dec. 1944 and Jan. 1945 before they were shot down on their fourth mission. They were supposed to bomb the No. 357 Nakajima Aircraft Factory in Tokyo.  Halloran said it was unforgettable for him when Japanese soldiers seized him from the custody of civilians who tried to save him.  He was beaten "severely" and brought to the Kempei Tai main prison in Tokyo, adjacent to the Imperial Palace grounds.  He spent 67 days in a "cold, dark room." Beatings and brutal interrogations followed. He lived through the March 10, 1945 fire raid in Tokyo that killed over 100,000 by the B-29 bombings.  Halloran was then moved to Ueno Zoo in Tokyo were he was placed in a "lion cage" and tied to the front bars so civilians could march by and see him.  He was naked and black from being unwashed with his hair unkempt.  He recalled how he lost 90 pounds and was "covered with open running sores" from bed bug bites.  Fellow American forces freed him when Tokyo was liberated on Aug. 29, 1945.  Now that he's back in Saipan, he wants to stay long.  "I hope (to stay longer) as I am enjoying it very, very much. I love this island," he said.   A grateful islands  In a speech yesterday morning at the American Memorial Park, Gov. Babauta hailed the contributions of the Enola Gay crew and other returning WWII veterans.  "To the Enola Gay crew and to all the veterans thank you and God bless you," he said.  Babauta said the CNMI commemorates the loss of lives and the sacrifices made by the U.S. soldiers during WWII.  The war gave birth to a new age of American presence and freedom to these islands.  "To Gen. Tibbets and your crew, thank you for putting a quick end to the war," Babauta said.  At 3:30 p.m. today, the parade honoring veterans of the Battles of Saipan and Tinian, as well as other Pacific campaigns, starts at Kristo Rai Church and ends at the American Memorial Park.  The Governor declared a half-day holiday for all government employees today.  At 5:15 p.m. today, formal ceremonies to honor the veterans begins.  Tomorrow, a similar ceremony will be held at Tinian's North Field.

       And here is the second article about Paul Tibbets that ran in the June 16 th  edition of  urlLink the Marianas Variety . Since their website lacks an archive, I thought I would reproduce it here for posterity:  NMC students grill Enola Gay crew  by Anges E. Donato  Variety News Staff   WHAT reaction do you get from Japanese people when you meet them and they find out who you are? Do you believe in killing innocent civilians if the need is great enough?  These were two of the toughest questions from Northern Marianas College students that retired Brig. Gen. Paul Tibbets, Morris Jeppson and Dutch Van Kirk had to answer during and open forum at NMC yesterday morning.  But the returning Enola Gay crew members were unfazed and even seemed to enjoy being grilled by the students.  "I've been used to tough questions. I've been answering tough questions all my life. (The students') questions were intelligent and I enjoyed answering them all. They are a good bunch of students and I like them," Van Kirk told Variety in an interview.  To the first question, Tibbets replied that he generally had no trouble dealing with the Japanese. The Enola Gay - which dropped atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 - is actually quite popular in Japan, he added.  He said one Japanese businessman once told him, "We look up to you the way the American Negroes look up to (former President) Abraham Lincoln. You granted us emancipation. You freed us."  Van Kirk earned the applause of the NMC faculty and students with his witty reply to the second question.  "Yes, I do believe the killing of civilians is justified if the need is great enough. Mussolini was a civilian, Adolf Hitler was a civilian. In fact, I have certain people on my list that I'd like to see killed," Van Kirk said.   Advice  He and Jeppson then gave the students some words of advice.  "Always have an inquisitive mind. Don't believe all the baloney you read in your books, although not all of them are baloney. Get your own thoughts. I've always had a happy life because although Paul (Tibbets) gave me a lot of orders, I didn't follow all of them," Van Kirk said, partly in jest.  Jeppson added, "Just have a good life and do a good job."  Tibbets declined to comment.  For their part, the students said they were very honored to have met the Enola Gay crew.  "It's heartwarming. I never expected to meet anyone from history, especially from World War II. It's an honor," Liberal Arts student Francine Manibusan said.  Accounting student Tatiana Babauta said she was very impressed by the Enola Gay crew, especially by their wit.   Signing autographs   The three Enola Gay crew members also signed autographs at the Dai Ichi Hotel lobby yesterday afternoon.  Between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., the signed copies of Tibbets' book "Enola Gay," as well as photos of the plane and a poster on the mission.  Hideyuki Suzuki, a tourist from Tokyo who happened to passed by the lobby, could not believe his luck when he saw Tibbets, Jeppson and Van Kirk signing autographs.  Suzuki, however, was unsure at first if he could buy a copy of the book.  "I am Japanese. Can I buy a copy?" he asked one of the veterans' assistants.  After paying for his copy, Suzuki lined up to have the three men sign it. He also posed for a photograph with them.  "The story of the Enola Gay is well known and I am interested in (Gen. Tibbets) book about it," Suzuki told Variety.  He added, "Frankly speaking, I'm very sorry that the atomic bombing had to happen, but that's part of war. And war is miserable. That's why we should try to avoid it."  Autographed copies of Tibbets' Enola Gay book are sold at $60 each while photographs of the plane are available at $34 each. Those who want both the book and the photograph may buy them at $80.  The posters, which bear the signatures of three crew members and the 60 th  anniversary commemoration cancellation stamp, are sold at $100 each. I think the Marianas Variety needs a good editor. Besides the clunky language and misspellings (the leader of Nazi Germany was  Adolph  Hitler), I know the Enola Gay dropped  urlLink Little Boy  on Hiroshima on August 6 th , 1945 and a different plane, B-29 #77 - rechristened Bockscar after the bombing, dropped  urlLink Fat Man  on Nagasaki on August 9 th . Enola Gay did not drop both  urlLink bombs , and nowhere does Tibbets make that claim. It's just a half-assed assumption by a lazy reporter. I'm surprised nobody even bothered to  urlLink fact check  some of the stuff written in this article.  Other media in the region covered the visit by the Enola Gay crew, most notably the  urlLink Saipan Tribune . Since they archive their stories, let me just link to them in reverse chronological order.   urlLink Enola Gay Crew Bids Farewell    urlLink Tibbets - No Regrets Over Hiroshima    urlLink NMC Students Meet With Enola Gay Crew    urlLink 60 Years Of Freedom Remembered    urlLink Enola Gay To Return To Tinian    urlLink An Island Revisited And A Time Remembered

       The Wednesday, June 16 th  edition of the Marianas Variety has a couple interesting articles about Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the Enola Gay. I thought I would reproduce them here.  Tibbets says he didn't want to return to CNMI  by Gemma Q. Casas  Variety News Staff   RETIRED U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Tibbets endured almost two days of flying hours to reach the CNMI, 60 years after he first set foot on the islands. But he says he doesn't regret the long flight at all.  "It turned out to be somewhat like a homecoming," he said in an interview yesterday at the Penthouse of the Dai-Ichi Hotel where he is billeted.  Locals and foreigners alike treated Tibbets like a celebrity the past two days on occasion of the 60 th  commemoration of the Battles of Saipan and Tinian. The 89-year-old former pilot was bombarded with request for autographs and photo opportunities.  But Tibbets admitted he hesitated at first returning to the islands which made him famous and which he made famous as well when he dropped atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945, from Tinian, the second largest island in the CNMI.  The bombing claimed the lives of thousands of innocent Japanese civilians but also led to the surrender of the Japanese government which ended World War II.  "I have read things about the Marianas chain, particularly Guam, Saipan and Tinian... I really didn't know what was expected of me so I said, 'I don't really want to go to the Marianas, this trip' But then I thought, that's the wrong attitude. I owe those people something. They helped secure the land that we could use to have their place fly to Japan and so forth and so I said 'I'm going to go out there,'" said Tibbets.  "I want all the native people to see who I am and what I am. In that way, they could make their opinion of whether (what) they have been given credit to is a myth or not," he added.  With so many books written about WWII, Tibbets said the flying hours is nothing compared to his mission: "To set the record straight" of what really happened during the bombing missions.  "I wanted to come here and set the record straight, because when I die there's no way I could make that record straight," Tibbets said.  The former pilot and his manager arrived on Saipan, the capital of the now U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, on Monday from Ohio via Hawaii.  Their total flight hours could sum up to about two days including the brief stopover in Hawaii.  Tibbets said in his younger years, he could fly straight to a destination in fewer hours.  "It took us two days to get here. We stopped in Hawaii. Of course, when I had my own airplanes I could fly from Utah out here in an average of 35 to 36 hours which I did... I made one trip with four pilots on the airplane. Three besides myself. We did it in 72 hours, round-trip. I mean you got to depend on the speed of the airplane," Tibbets said.  "In those days too, we didn't have the comfort that you got in the airline today. The B-29 was the first one to be pressurized and to have heat. It was extremely well," he added.  Former U.S. president George Bush Sr. also fought in the Pacific during WWII for the U.S. Air Force.  On his 80 th  birthday, the former president went skydiving.  When Tibbets learned about it, he said, "Good for him. But I couldn't do that (anymore)."

        Before I consign it to the dustbin of my memory, one final post on  urlLink Ulysses  and  urlLink Bloomsday . Well actually a  urlLink few links  to  urlLink various thoughts  on  urlLink James Joyce's   urlLink immortal classic . And yes, I have read it - twice now - and I  urlLink enjoyed  it immensely.  I was happy to hear about Ulysses being available as  urlLink a page a day via RSS , that's very cool. And the Guardian's Bloomsday Blog was funny. But I found the NY Times article particularly interesting, especially John Banvilles' reminisces about Jorge Luis Borges and the centenary celebration in 1982:  Among the many notable artists who came was -- yes -- Borges, who by then was in his 80's and totally blind. He was collected from the airport by a couple of volunteer meeters-and-greeters, who deposited him in his suite at the Shelbourne Hotel and went off to do more meeting and greeting. When they returned, late in the day, Borges was still in his room, and in fact had not left during the intervening hours. What was he to have done, Borges asked, since he did not know the city or anyone in it? Ever since, when I hear talk of Bloomsday celebrations, that, I am afraid, is the image that springs immediately to mind: an old, blind writer, one of the greatest of his age, sitting alone in a hotel room overlooking an unseen St. Stephen's Green.

        I'd hate to be wandering the halls of a hospital and come across a   urlLink bear wandering the hallways . The bear walked in front of the sliding doors to the ER and when they opened, he set off on his grand adventure. He wandered the halls of the hospital, freaking out patients and employees, until he ended up in an office. He was probably looking for drugs,  urlLink hillbilly heroin  probably. The cops decided to prove their machismo by shooting the animal dead instead of drugging the bear and hauling him off to a shelter or something. I guess they thought that would be a lesson for other bears or something.  Apparently some people at the hospital thought this was a gag of some sort, and refused to believe it was really a bear. Reminds me of a great  urlLink Chuck Jones cartoon  based on a  urlLink children's story  with the great quote: "You're not a bear. You're a silly man who needs a shave and wears a fur coat."  The Bear That Wasn't   Once upon a time, in fact it was on a Tuesday, the Bear saw that it was time to go into a cave and hibernate. And that was just what he did. Not long afterward, in fact it was on a Wednesday, lots of workers arrived near that cave. While the Bear slept, they built a great, huge factory.  As winter turned to spring, the Bear awoke and stepped out of his cave. His eyes popped.  Where was the forest?  Where was the grass?  Where were the trees?  Where were the flowers?  WHAT HAD HAPPENED?  "I must be dreaming," he said. "Of course, I'm dreaming." But it wasn't a dream. It was real. Just then the Foreman came out of the factory.   "Hey, you get back to work," he said.  The Bear replied, "I don't work here. I'm a Bear."  The Foreman laughed, "That's a fine excuse for a man to keep from doing any work. Saying he's a Bear."  The Bear said, "But, I am a Bear."  The Foreman stopped laughing. He was very mad. "Don't try to fool me," he said. "You're not a Bear. You're a silly man who needs a shave and wears a fur coat. I'm going to take you to the General Manager."  The General Manager also insisted the Bear was a silly man who needs a shave and wears a fur coat.  The Bear said, "No, you're mistaken. I am a Bear."  The General Manager was very mad, too.  The Bear said, "I'm sorry to hear you say that. You see, I am a Bear."  The Third Vice President was even madder. The Second Vice President was more than mad or madder. He was furious. The First Vice President yelled in rage. He said, "You're not a Bear. You're a silly man who needs a shave and wears a fur coat. I'm going to take you to the President."  The Bear pleaded, "This is a dreadful error, you know, because ever since I can remember, I've always been a Bear."  And that is exactly what the Bear told the President. "Thank you for telling me," the President said. "You can't be a Bear. Bears are only in a zoo or a circus. They're never inside a factory and that's where you are; inside a factory. So how can you be a Bear?"  The Bear said, "But I am a Bear."  The President said, "Not only are you a silly man who needs a shave and wears a fur coat, but you are also very stubborn. So I'm going to prove it to you, once and for all, that you are not a Bear."  The Bear said, "But I am a Bear."  The President packed his vice presidents and the Bear into a car and drove to the zoo. The Bears in the zoo said the Bear was not a Bear, because if he were a Bear, he would be inside a cage.  The Bear said, "But I am a Bear."  So they all left the zoo and drove to the nearest circus. "Is he a Bear?" the President asked the circus Bears.  The Bears said no. If he were a Bear he would be wearing a little hat with a striped ribbon holding onto a balloon and riding a bicycle.  The Bear said, "But I am a Bear."  When the President and his vice presidents returned to the factory, they put the Bear to work on a big machine with a lot of other men. The Bear worked on the big machine for many, many months.     After a long, long time, the factory closed and all the workers went away. The Bear was the last one left. As he left the shut-down factory, he saw geese flying south and the leaves falling from the trees. Winter was coming, he thought. It was time to hibernate.  He found a cave and was about to enter when he stopped. "I can't go in a cave. I'm NOT a Bear. I'm a silly man who needs a shave and wears a fur coat."  As the days grew colder and the snow fell, the Bear sat shivering with cold. "I wish I were a Bear," he thought.  Then suddenly he got up and walked through the deep snow toward the cave. Inside it was cozy and snug. The icy wind and cold, cold snow couldn't reach him here. He felt warm all over. He sank down on a bed of pine boughs and soon he was happily asleep and dreaming sweet dreams, just like all bears do, when they hibernate. So even though the FOREMAN and the GENERAL MANAGER and the THIRD VICE PRESIDENT and the SECOND VICE PRESIDENT and the FIRST VICE PRESIDENT and the PRESIDENT and the ZOO BEARS and the CIRCUS BEARS had said, he was a silly man who needed a shave and wore a fur coat, I don't think he really believed it. Do you? No indeed, he knew he wasn't a silly man, and he wasn't a silly Bear either.

       It finally came to Guam this weekend.  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  is playing at the Hafa Adai II theater this weekend, months after it opened Stateside. It figures, since Hafa Adai II is Guam's second run theater. It was happenstance that I noticed the movie listings just before I left work this evening. I wanted to catch this movie for months and I was pretty well resigned to waiting for it to come out on video, so I jumped at the chance to catch it in the theaters.  It was  urlLink easily the best film I've seen all year . Love, loss,  regret , the movie is a whirlwind of poignancy about relationships and the loss of love. Believe me, I am no fan of Jim Carrey, but his romance with Kate Winslet is wrenchingly beautiful to watch, their tortured break-up, the dappled moments of joy and achingly poignant happiness. I guess I will have to re-evaluate my impression of him.  And the movie is damn funny in spots. I was laughing pretty hard at some of the antics of the chorus of supporting characters, from Elijah Wood's creepy lovesick machinations to Kirsten Dunst (and her glorious boobs) smoking a joint and bouncing around on Jim Carrey's bed - with him knocked out and tucked under the covers. Their various sub-plots were an enjoyable diversion from the increasing chaos and wrenching desperation of Jim Carrey's memories. And they finally wove into the theme of the story well, an effective counterpoint to the central love story.  I'm glad I saw  urlLink Eternal Sunshine  tonight, but I was surprised at the reaction I got at work. I told G'nette I was going to the movie tonight, mainly to point out that it was finally here. We had a conversation back in March about how we both wanted to see it and how it would never come to Guam. When I showed her that it was playing this weekend, she was ambivalent. Turned out a friend told her it 'confused' her, and that it was hard to understand. I thought it was an enticing movie, not confusing at all, and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.

       It's been raining since Sunday on Guam, and I am getting a little sick of it. I guess this means rainy season has arrived for the year. The weather this week reminds me of August though, with the non-stop drizzle interspersed with occasional downpours. I could really use some sunshine for the weekend.  To chase away the blues I stopped off for a drinkie-winkie at the Mermaid Tavern last night. Located in the GCIC Building in Agana, the Mermaid Tavern is Guam's latest experiment in marketing microbrewed beers. The Great Deep Brewing Company was originally in Le Tasi Bistro back in 2002, but Typhoon Pongsona blew them out into the street. Their beers have been featured at Mac & Marti's in Tumon since February or so, but that's a little out of my way. This place is more convenient for me.  There are five microbrewed beers on tap, a pilsener, a pale ale, Irish red ale, Scottish ale and a stout. Real, fresh tasting beer instead of that pale, fizzy, watery crap peddled by Budweiser and Miller. The menu includes a wide selection of burgers and po' boy sandwiches, and there are plenty of specials available too. I just ate some pupus but I plan to head back tomorrow night or Saturday and try the food.  Mmm, beer...

       I finally gave in and  urlLink drank the Kool-Aid  this weekend. After looking at the best seller lists for over a year, I finally sat down and read Dan Brown's magnum opus,  urlLink  The Da Vinci Code  . In fact, I went whole hog and read his earlier work,  urlLink  Angels & Demons   this weekend too.  Let me save the trouble. If this sort of stuff interests you, read one or the other. Basically they were the exact same mediocre book. Seriously - the plot of both books contained many of the exact same elements:   An elderly scholar murdered with evidence pointing towards a secret society  The hero, Robert Langdon, awakened in the dead of night to spend the next day or so uncovering this secret society  The murdered scholar's distraught yet intelligent (and oh so sexy) daughter/grand daughter  The obtuse authority figures blundering around making life difficult for the hero  A couple decoy bad guys set up and later exonerated  The supposed ally who turns out to be the archvillian  A menacing, murderous, but misguided, button man duped by the archvillian  A malevolent secret society revealed to be smoke and mirrors  A series of blindingly obvious leads, unveiled as thunderous revelations  Plenty of second rate religious tomfoolery, featuring the Catholic Church  Lots of running around to medieval churches at night So basically it's a bunch of nonsense, but what amusing nonsense it is. For what it is worth,  Angels & Demons  was the better novel. Perhaps because I read it first, but it seemed more original and it was definitely more exciting that  The Da Vinci Code .  Angels & Demons  revolves around the rumored  urlLink Illuminati  striking out at the Catholic Church during a particularly vulnerable moment for the church; the Pope has passed away, and the College of Cardinals is locked away in deliberations  urlLink to elect a new Pope . The  urlLink Illuminati , a secret society of scientists suppressed by the Church since the Renaissance, have secreted a high tech antimatter bomb somewhere in the Vatican during this crucial point. Robert Langdon must uncover a centuries old trail left by original Illuminati  urlLink Galileo  and  urlLink Bernini  across Rome to find the bomb before the Vatican, the Cardinals, and the vast treasures of the Catholic Church are annihilated in the antimatter explosion. It's basically a fast paced scavenger hunt, with Langdon and his female sidekick dashing around Rome hoping to stop the mayhem. Brown tosses history, art, science, religion and conspiracy theories into a fun melange of thrilling action.   urlLink  The Da Vinci Code   was also a lot of fun to read, but it seemed more formulaic. Besides the plot similarities I mentioned above, the story lacked the zing that  Angels & Demons  had. The mass destruction of Christendom's holiest city is a powerful device to propel the plot.  The Da Vinci Code's  main threat is Langdon being falsely accused of murder and dashing around to prove his innocence and the presence of a conspiracy against him, all the while being chased by the French Police Judiciare and its implacable chief inspector. Shades of  urlLink Inspector Javert , which was probably intentional (Victor Hugo is mentioned several times as a former grandmaster of the book's secret society). Brown sprinkles in just enough art, history and science to give the story depth without boring casual readers out of their skull. The plot whirls along at a brisk clip, from the Louvre to a Swiss bank, a country chateau, several medieval churches and Westminster Abbey, with a denouement in windswept church in Scotland. But it never seemed to generate the sense of urgency that  Angels & Demons  did, and it limps along to an unsatisfying the climax.  The main concept this time around is that the Catholic Church is murdering the members of a secret society preserving a secret at the root of Christianity; that Jesus lived as a mortal man, with a wife and child. I don't think I'm spoiling any plot twists here, I've seen several 'documentaries' on the Discovery Channel and Michael Baigent's book  urlLink  Holy Blood, Holy Grail   that cover the same territory. The wife of Jesus is none other than Mary Magdalene, and their progeny somehow or other founded  urlLink the royal line of the French monarchy , a secret longsuppressedd by the church. Brown does a good job of laying out the history behind this theory, from the  urlLink ,  urlLink the First Council of Nicaea , the  urlLink Merovingians , and religious iconography. The best part of the book is when he takes Da Vinci's fresco,  urlLink  The Last Supper  , and picks it apart. Everything in this religious masterpiece is  urlLink evidence of Mary Magdalene's  role as the  urlLink chalice of Christ ,  urlLink the Holy Grail .  I had higher expectations though. First, Dan Brown seems to backpedal furiously at the end of the book. The church really isn't out murdering people, they were duped by a madman. Whatever. Take the bull by the horns buddy and just make the Catholic Church the bad guy. Perhaps he was afraid of alienating religious readers, but I doubt the kind of people that  urlLink frothed at the mouth  over  urlLink  The Last Temptation of Christ   will bother to read a book like this. So why spend the first half of the book setting up a malevolent, conservative Catholic order as the heavy, only to switch tracks and make them poor deluded souls duped by schemers and disingenuous scholars? It is a  nonsequiturr , and the book suffers because of it.  Secondly, Brown is skimming across the top of a  urlLink vast trove of material , dumbing it down and removing a great deal of the  urlLink allegorical richness  that other works dealing with this subject matter evoke. Umberto Eco is the master of this genre of thriller fiction.  urlLink  The Name of the Rose   mines the Catholic symbolism and kinky murders with far more finesse than either of Brown's works, and  urlLink  Foucault's Pendulum   is the benchmark that any other novel exploring the  urlLink Illuminati ,  urlLink Rosicrucians , and  urlLink Knight Templars  should be compared against. The incredible web of history and conspiracy Eco's weaves in  Foucault's Pendulum  made me paranoid for a week the first time I read it. I was seeing conspiracies and connections in everything, and it freaked me out. And the crushing conclusion of Eco's novel, it's damning revelation about man's tendency to construct vast conspiracies and alternate histories from a simple shopping list, is a telling evocation of human susceptibility, the many paths to madness and nihilism. And let's face it, Dan Brown doesn't compare dig that deep.  Lastly, it takes skill and sleight of hand toreallyy make a vast, hidden conspiracy come to life in the pages of a book. This is the worst flaw in  The Da Vinci Code . Dan Brown reveals all his secrets too early in the novel and it struggles after that. A writer needs to keep the conspiracy off camera, out of reach, out of touch, mysterious, slowly revealing more and more information as the novel unfolds.  Pynchon's  urlLink  The Crying of Lot 49   offers up a perfect example. The story starts with nary a mention of conspiracies. Only slowly are they unveiled through a seemingly innocuous collection of stamps and a collection of coincidences. What is  urlLink W.A.S.T.E.  and who are  urlLink Tristero ? What is their the connection to Yoyodyne? How deep does the conspiracy go? Many of the facts surrounding Pynchon's conspiracies are vague and undefined. They lurk in the shadows, mysterious, powerful. Oedipa Maas' growing paranoia becomes the reader's. He leaves the reader hanging in suspense as deeper layers are unveiled further into the book. In contrast, Brown offers up his secret society, and all their meager secrets, in the first half of the book. The book sputters from location to location after that until it collapses into a showdown at Westminster Abbey.  I stayed up Saturday night reading  Angels & Demons , then pulled another all-nighter Sunday night with  The Da Vinci Code . And after reading both of them, I was left with a guilty, icky feeling: "I stayed up all night to read this nonsense?" Kind of like when I read a Stephen King novel. It's enjoyable at the time, but I know I'll regret it in the morning.  The Da Vinci Code  troubles me a bit more than Stephen King's pablum, probably because so many people seem ready to accept the fanciful history Brown spins in the novel without digging deeper into the source material. I guess people want to see  urlLink vast conspiracies controlling events  from the shadows, like Eco illustrates. Look at the furor over the  urlLink Kennedy assassination  and the crackpots that say  urlLink NASA never landed  a  urlLink man on the moon . People  urlLink want to believe . My concern is that readers will take Brown's pseudo-history as fact instead of fiction and that may lead them to the wrong conclusions about the Christianity and church history. I hope the ideas related in the book will propel curious readers to research the early church, art history, or the Renaissance.

And so Ted Williams remains in an icebox, until science can reanimate him to play ball again. The world sure is full of some weird shit.

       I am so ashamed of myself. Should I reveal my dirty little secret? I guess I must...  I just finished reading James Clavell's  urlLink Gai-Jin , and it is not something I am proud of. It was schlock, complete schlock. I knew it was crappy in the first 50 pages, shortly after the languorous rape of the main female protagonist I knew it was utter crap. I actually put the book down and avoided it for over two months. But I have a stubborn streak in me that hates to abandon a book,  any book , once I start reading it. So two weekends ago I picked up that weighty tome of baloney and started reading it in earnest.  And once I got past it's faults it wasn't all that bad. Of course it was terrible, with wooden characters, confusing dialogue and a steady string of natural disasters to push the plot along, but I enjoyed the setting and some of the Japanese characters. I found myself rooting for them and eager to get past the wearisome blunderings of the gai-jin in Yokohama.  One major fault: I think over half the book was written in the  urlLink pluperfect tense , which does not make for good story telling. 'He had eaten after he had talked to the ship captain.' Seriously, every other page some character or another drifted off into reverie and I was treated to an expository flashback. Even worse, I reckon at least three different times when one character started a flashback, then another character  in the flashback  had a deeper flashback. Huh? Who's point of view is that? It certainly befuddled me. What do you call that? Superduperpluperfect tense?  In spite of all this confusion with tenses and point of view, I enjoyed it. Can't really go wrong with all those samurai chopping their way through scores of people. Will I read another Clavell novel? No freaking way. I read Shogun ages ago when I was in grade school (seriously), but Gai-Jin was nowhere near as good. I guess I will just chalk this one up as a mistake, a guilty pleasure, and move on.

This is the case surrounding illegally installed streetlights that Gutierrez administration officials peppered throughout residential neighborhoods.   urlLink Haim Habib Deemed Competent To Stand Trial  - Local attorney Haim Habib, accused of multiple charges stemming from having sex with 13 and 14 year old girls, was deemed competent to stand trial this week. Habib had been confined to the Department of Mental Health since March when court psychologists testified that he was a delusional paranoid.   urlLink Cockfighting Flip Flop  - A day after announcing that  urlLink cock fighting  would be a nightly event at the Liberation carnival this year, the Liberation committee announced that all gambling, including cockfighting, was being dropped from the carnival. Seems the governor did not like the idea, so it was dropped.   urlLink Snakes!  - Locals are grumbling about possible cost increases if measures in the CNMI and Hawaii are approved. The measures would require all cargo leaving Guam to be thoroughly inspected for brown tree snakes in an effort to contain the animal's spread across the Pacific. This could result in higher costs for shipping goods off the island.   urlLink FEMA Aid For Yap Hits $6 Million  - Relief efforts are continuing on Yap, two months after the devastation of typhoon Sudal. 99% of the island's power and water systems are restored, and the only homes left to repair are the ones totally destroyed by the typhoon. Unfortunately, that is over 700 homes. Donations are still being accepted.   urlLink New Airport Manager  - The A.B.

       Two Saturdays ago I ran some errands in Agana, and I ate lunch at Quizno's. Monday I drove down to Agana at lunch to check my mail, and decided to check out Quizno's for lunch again. Alas,  urlLink Quizno's closed their doors  sometime in the last two weeks. I heard their was difficulty with the business, but I also understood it would stay open until a new investor was found. I guess the debts got too large or something. It's a shame, they made a good sandwich (though they were a little pricey).  There was an article in the  urlLink Marianas Business Journal  on Quizno's troubles, but unfortunately that online journal is no longer free. I wouldn't mind subscribing, they have some good articles, but $10 a month is far too steep. That's $120 a year for a subscription that comes out bi-weekly. That's $4.62 per issue. Hell, I subscribe to  urlLink Salon , it's $35 a year  and  published daily. I understand that economies of scale are in play here, Marianas Business Journal will never be as large as Salon, or other major online magazines so they need to charge a little more to make a profit on their niche product, but sorry Charlie, that's just too much for too little.

       It is  urlLink termite swarming season on Guam , that time of the year when hordes of horny termites take to the air just after sunset, looking for love in all the wrong places. Like the back of my neck, the hood of my car, in my socks and generally anywhere they feel like falling to earth.  Guam has a cycle of plagues and infestations, and this is only the most current. Other plagues include these little black gnats, those  urlLink giant African   urlLink snails , the infamous  urlLink brown tree snake , and  urlLink  bufo marinus  , the cane toad. Those damn toads have been out in force lately too, and their flattened corpses line the highways. And all these species are introduced, invasive species. I wonder if these periodic plagues, when thousands come out of hiding and roam the landscape, are related in any way to their exotic nature?

       Of interest to a few:  I played host to my nephew's two dimensional doppelganger for the past few days.  urlLink Flat Nicholas  and I went to a few events over the weekend, and ended up doing a tour around the island. I took plenty of pictures, so check out the  urlLink web album  I just put up, there's a few good pictures of Guam and the sights.

       A day after controversial appointee LizaMarie Camacho  urlLink stepped down from her position as deputy director at DYA  more questionable appointments at the agency appeared.  urlLink Three federally funded positions  slated for recruitment as youth service worker assistants were apparently filled by relatives of staffers working in the lt. governor's Guam State Clearinghouse office, an office devoted to consolidating and verifying all federally funded grants and positions in the Government of Guam. The three positions were filled by relatives of these high ranking staffers without undergoing the usual screening process, after the hiring documents were altered by the director of the office. Surprise, surprise. According to documents obtained by KUAM News, former Guam State Clearinghouse director Bertha Duenas made alterations to the documents, including changes from recruitment-limited term appointment to temporary appointments. While he hasn't spoken to anyone at the Lieutenant Governor's Office, Sanchez forwarded the concerns to the director of the Department of Administration, the Public Auditor, and the Governor's legal counsel. The governor's chief of staff says he doesn't understand why the merit system was bypassed.  It appears the alterations are not the Administration's only concern, as KUAM News looked into the names of the individuals who were hired for the DYA positions. According to the documents, Paul Quenga, Carlene Mendiola and Maria Blas were appointed as youth service worker assistants.  Duenas today confirmed that Quenga is her son, and Carlene's mother, Josie Mendiola, is the executive assistant in the Guam State Clearinghouse. Recently fired Lieutenant Governor's staff assistant Raymond Blas is the father of Maria Blas. The Governor's Office is also investigating the link between the individual's hired and the changes made to the recruitments. The Guam State Clearinghouse is at the center of the schism between the governor and lt. governor. Governor Camacho disbanded the office and laid off the staff several months ago, after the Clearinghouse altered some documents relating to off island travel the governor approved. Some sort of low-level office war has been going on between Camacho and Lt. Governor Moylan ever since. The two are not on speaking terms, and a lawsuit is brewing over the closure of the office and the dismissal of the employees. This latest development adds to the imbroglio.  I've said it before; politics on Guam is a tempest in a teapot. I am sure things here are no different than anywhere else, it's just the close proximity of the island intensifies all these dramas into a whirlwind of rumor and innuendo.

       One nice thing about all this traveling is the chance to sample all the great beers. I already mentioned  urlLink St. Arnold's  in Houston and their great brewery "tour." Now let me throw in a plug for  urlLink Karl Strauss  brewpubs out here in Southern California. Damn tasty beer, and the patrons at the bar are quite passionate about it. I stopped in for happy hour a couple days ago and enjoyed myself so much I am thinking about paying them another visit today after class. Fresh beer does taste better, just not that nasty crap Budweiser markets as beer.  This is my last day in California, I fly out tonight for St. Louis and a few days with my family. It's been a good week, I've learned a great deal and I've really enjoyed the cool California weather. Last night I paid a visit to some former co-workers. They left Guam late last year and settled in Orange County. They seem to be doing well and I was glad to get a chance to visit.

        So  urlLink Ricky Williams , one of the best and  urlLink oddest running backs  in the NFL these last few years, retired on Sunday. He said he was tired of the game and lost his desire to go through another grueling season. Sounds fair to me, I've played football and I know the older you get, the worse you feel after a game. I can only imagine what it feels like to get pounded by professional players, and I grimace just thinking about it. If he wants to bow out of the league and  urlLink wander the earth  like Caine in  urlLink Kung Fu , so be it.     Today comes a story about how  urlLink Williams failed his third drug test  in as many years, and was facing suspension by the league before he decided to retire. He readily admitted he smokes marijuana, and while he knows the league bans drug use, he refused to stop smoking it. Call it  urlLink reefer madness , but it looks like Williams knew the gig was up and decided to exit stage right before facing censure and fines by the NFL.  I'm sure a front page story in  urlLink High Times  will be out soon.

       James van Allen, noted space scientist and discover of the radiation belts that cocoon the planet Earth, spoke out  urlLink against human space flight  in a  urlLink recent essay .  Writing in the journal  urlLink  Issues in Science and Technology  , van Allen calls for a rational examination of the costs versus the benefits of manned space flight. The costs are high, both in human lives and finances, and the scientific data returned is paltry compared to unmanned satellites and interplanetary probes. In his book Race to the Stratosphere: Manned Scientific Ballooning in America (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1989), David H. De Vorkin describes the glowing expectations for high-altitude piloted balloon flights in the 1930's. But it soon became clear that such endeavors had little scientific merit. At the present time, unmanned high-altitude balloons continue to provide valuable service to science. But piloted ballooning has survived only as an adventurous sport. There is a striking resemblance here to the history of human spaceflight.  "Almost all of the space programs important advances in scientific knowledge have been accomplished by hundreds of robotic spacecraft in orbit about Earth and on missions to the distant planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune," van Allen writes. Similarly, robotic exploration of comets and asteroids "has truly revolutionized our knowledge of the solar system," he adds.  Four decades of human space flight have proven one thing: Space is inimical to human life. It is a harsh place, full of radiation and debilitating zero gravity, to say nothing of the launch and re-entry hazards. To ensure the safety of astronauts, astronomical costs are incurred designing safety measures and backups; money that could be better spent on unmanned robotic missions to the frontiers of the solar system. A perfect example is NASA's decision to  urlLink abandon  the  urlLink Hubble Space Telescope  in favor of completing  urlLink the orbiting boondoggle  also known as the International Space Station.

       Still here boys & girls, I've just been wandering about the country in airplanes for the last few days. I left Seattle late last week, spent the weekend in a steamy Houston, and I am now in sunny southern California. This excursion to Orange County was unplanned, but I am here now and it is a good thing.    I spent the weekend in Houston, mostly because my tickets were non-refundable, and it was more expensive to change the ticket to a new destination than just buying a new ticket. Crazy. Houston was a good time though, because my good friend Craig lives there and we had the weekend to kick back and relax. Here's a couple highlights:   urlLink The Ginger Man  - I only put it together later, but I'd actually been to one of these in Dallas a few years ago. I didn't know it was a chain of bars. Lots of beers on tap, some okay pupus and excellent jukebox loaded with Grateful Dead and Phish. And the bathroom reminded me of the  urlLink Coughy Haus  back at the old alma mater.   urlLink Saint Arnold Brewing Company  - I thought it was going to be a mildly amusing brewery tour, but it soon became obvious it was a party. Every Saturday at 13:00, the Saint Arnold Brewing Company holds a "tour." It was certainly the most euphemistic of brewery tours I've ever been on. It lasted maybe five minutes and then the crowd of 300 people got down to drinking the free beer and enjoying the music and whatever snacks they brought along. Definitely a must do stop in Houston. The beer was damn good and the cheery ambiance of the regulars and staff is quite welcoming.   urlLink El Buen Bife Argentina Grill  - Friday night was really jonesin' for a steak and Craig suggested this place. At first I thought we were going to  urlLink Fogo de Ch&atilde;o , the place where they serve meat on swords. I was mistaken, but I was not disappointed. It was the best damn steak I've eaten in a long time. Tender, juicy and bursting with flavor, that filet mignon was like everything a steak should be. How about a few pictures from this sojourn in Houston? I got a few to share:                           Not a bad weekend, even if my plans went awry. And now that I'm in sunny (and chilly) California, I got a chance to meet up with some co-workers based here in Orange County. We're meeting up tomorrow night for beers and some dinner at  urlLink the Yardhouse . I may even take some pictures.

       I forgot to mention this story last weekend.

The march from Ylig Bay to the site of the concentration camp in the Manenggon hills concluded with the unveiling of the entrance memorial to  urlLink a Manenggon memorial park  slated for construction on the site. During a somber ceremony at the Manenggon site, concentration camp survivor, historian and former Sen. Tony Palomo spoke of survivors' experiences. Despite the suffering inflicted upon the Chamorro people, Palomo... stressed forgiveness.  Father Eric Forbes also spoke of forgiveness in his homily. Speaking both in Chamorro and English, he told the audience not to hate.  "This is not what God wants," Forbes said.  Also during the ceremony, Japan Consul General Kennosuke Iriyama joined survivors and board members Rita Franquez, Marian Johnston Taitano and former first lady Geri Gutierrez. They placed a floral wreath on the entrance monument that was unveiled yesterday.   The PDN ran a series of pictures covering  urlLink  Hasso Manenggon   and the memorial park. Here is a photo of the memorial fountain:

       Found this obituary in today's  urlLink  Seattle Times  :  Charles Sweeney, pilot of plane that dropped A-bomb on Nagasaki  MILTON, Mass. - Charles Sweeney, 84, a retired Air Force general who piloted the plane that dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki in the final days of World War II, has died.  Mr. Sweeney died Thursday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, hospital spokeswoman Christine Johanson said. She did not disclose the cause of death.  Mr. Sweeney was 25 when he piloted the B-29 bomber that attacked Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima and six days before Japan surrendered.  About 70,000 people were killed in the explosion of the bomb, dubbed "Fat Man." It was the first bomb Mr. Sweeney ever dropped on an enemy target.  He was an outspoken defender of the bombings, appearing on CNN and speaking at colleges and universities.  Mr. Sweeney also wrote a book, "War's End: An Eyewitness Account of America's Last Atomic Mission," to counter what he considered "cockamamie theories" that the bombings were unnecessary.  "I looked upon it as a duty. I just wanted the war to be over, so we could get back home to our loved ones," he told The Patriot Ledger of Quincy in 1995. "I hope my missions were the last ones of their kind that will ever be flown."  Mr. Sweeney also played a role in the bombing at Hiroshima, where he flew an instrument plane that accompanied the Enola Gay during the attack.  The Nagasaki bombing run, in Mr. Sweeney's B-29, the Bock's Car, was harrowing for the crew. The flight had fuel problems from the start, and clouds and smoke were covering the mission's primary target, the city of Kokura.  After making several dangerous passes over the city, he abandoned the primary target and flew to Nagasaki. Only a break in the clouds allowed the bomb to be dropped, Mr. Sweeney said.  Mr. Sweeney was a graduate of North Quincy High School who traced his passion for flying to a local airfield. He became a brigadier general in 1956, and at the time was the youngest man in the Air Force to reach that rank. He retired in 1976.  Strange how both Sweeney and Paul Tibbets wrote books to explain how necessary it was for them to bomb two cities into oblivion and to set the record straight against disparagement. They will forever known to history as the men that obliterated Japanese cities with nuclear bombs. All justifications aside, it is a terrible thing to live with the deaths of 70,000 people on your head.

        Did I mention my hotel is across the street from that amazing  urlLink new Seattle Public Library ? How serendipitous. I plan on checking it out tomorrow - I don't have anything to do until 3:00 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.  I spent the afternoon in conference sessions, by 5:00 p.m. I was so tired. I didn't mean to fall asleep, but after I got off the phone around 6:00, I fell asleep until 9:30. I headed looking for dinner after I woke up, but I was extremely disappointed. I took a walk this morning around downtown and I located three Thai restaurants that looked very appealing. I set out tonight with intentions to eat at one of those three places, but every one of them was closed by the time I arrived. It struck me as extremely odd. Maybe I am just used to Guam, but I really don't think restaurants should close at 9:00 p.m. on a Saturday night.  I wandered around for a long time and eventually found  urlLink The Islander , a tiki bar and restaurant. Funny how the island boy gravitates for the island bar. Actually I picked it because it looked low key. It was, but with a well stocked bar. While the main kitchen was closed, I could order pupus. Good enough. Mix in some sushi with tasty Pacific Northwest hefeweizen and you got a good dinner. I settled in at the bar and drank my fill for a few hours. I was comfortable and felt like a bit of home. The music on the P.A. was your typical fiesta mix of cha cha and island dub. But the crowd at the bar was definitely Seattle twentysomething's. It was a good, relaxing, low key place. And the pupus weren't half bad either.

       I arrived in Seattle at 8:00 a.m. this morning. Got to the hotel in  downtown and promptly fell asleep. I am convinced airline seats are  designed to be as uncomfortable as possible. I couldn't sleep a minute  on the plane and one in-flight movie was  urlLink    urlLink  Welcome to Mooseport  , possibly the worst movie I have ever endured. The other movie was  urlLink  50 First Dates  ,  which was innocent enough and made me laugh a few times. The flight was  completely full, not an empty seat on the plane. Crammed into a flying  tin can with 450+ other people is not my favorite travelling conditions.    Oh well all this kvetching will get me no where. The conference starts  tomorrow, and I actually think I am ready to go back to bed and sleep  some more. I was absolutely exhausted this morning. I didn't sleep the  night before the flight, who can get up at 4:00 a.m. to check in for a  6:00 a.m. flight - I stayed up all night. The only rest I got in  transit was about an hour in the Narita traveller's lounge. They have  these great recliners in a quiet corner of the bottom floor lounge that  are perfect for catching some sleep. I can't begin to describe how  comfortable they were to an exhausted traveller, it was just what I  needed.

I'll spend a week in Seattle at a conference, then head east for a week of training and a quick visit with my parents in St. Louis. I'm looking forward to the trip, I've never been to Seattle before. Now if only I didn't have to sit in coach for 9 hours to get there...

       Dr. Gary Heathcote, professor of anthropology at  urlLink UOG , is concerned.

       While Scaled Composites'  urlLink SpaceShipOne made history  as the first privately financed spacecraft, a Canadian project designed to snare the $10 million  urlLink X Prize  is also nearing completion. And while SpaceShipOne cost $20 million, the  urlLink da Vinci Project  is trying to  urlLink get into space on a shoestring budget .  Their entry in the competition is called Wild Fire, and it takes a different approach than Scaled's space plane. Wild Fire is a rocket/capsule contraption, lofted to 70,000 feet by a gigantic helium balloon. Once at altitude, the rocket will fire, blasting the capsule to 60 miles above the Saskatchewan prairie. Instead of gliding to a runway landing like SpaceShipOne, Wild Fire will parachute back to earth.  The real kicker here is that the da Vinci Project is almost entirely a volunteer effort. They've built this contraption for a measly $1 million Canadian, plus about $3 million Canadian in donated services. That's peanuts, chump change compared to Scaled Composites and the  urlLink other teams .

         The  urlLink Missouri Botanical Garden  will host  urlLink a Buckminster Fuller stamp dedication ceremony  on July 14 th  on the steps of the  urlLink Climatron , the first geodesic dome used as a conservatory. The  urlLink US Post Office  will issue a Buckminster Fuller commemorative stamp starting on July 12 th , and I wish I were in St. Louis to participate. Shaw's Garden is one of my favorite places on this green earth, and  urlLink Buckminster Fuller  deserves to honored not only for the geodesic dome, but for  urlLink design science  and pointing the way for humanity's future. Design science can best be defined as inventions that provide for the betterment of humanity in a sustainable, environmentally sound manner. Think renewable energy sources, bioremediation of polluted soil and water, hybrid cars, bio-degradable plastics or hydrogen fuel cells.  The function of what I call  urlLink design science  is to solve problems by introducing into the environment new artifacts, the availability of which will induce their spontaneous employment by humans and thus, coincidentally, cause humans to abandon their previous problem-producing behaviors and devices. For example, when humans have a vital need to cross the roaring rapids of a river, as a design scientist I would design them a bridge, causing them, I am sure, to abandon spontaneously and forever the risking of their lives by trying to swim to the other shore. -  urlLink R. Buckminster Fuller , 1895-1983  Fuller was a visionary, who saw the problems of the world as opportunities to change old fashioned harmful practices into newer, positive inventions. I've read a couple of his books, and they were real eye openers. All too often it seems like people are more than willing to protest against something, but they offer no real alternatives. Fuller said that fighting the existing reality never changes anything. "To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."

       Illinois republicans are scrambling for a candidate to run against  urlLink Barack Obama  in the senate race this year, after  urlLink Jack Ryan's   urlLink campaign   urlLink implosion  last month. Since state senator  urlLink Steve Rauschenberger refused to run for office , some pundits are calling for a Schwarzenegger-esque candidate, someone to rally the masses in Illinois, a person able to run on his popularity and not a platform, a person of wealth and god-like status in Illinois, somebody like  urlLink Mike Ditka . I'm not kidding, the idea is buzzing around the internet, with a web site devoted to  urlLink drafting Ditka  into the senate race. Stranger things have happened. So far this is just a fanciful pipe dream, but a  urlLink similar drive  did get  urlLink Wesley Clark  to throw his hat into the ring of democratic candidates for president.

       A tip of the hat to my friend Terry for noting this story in the July 8 th  NY Times:  urlLink When Life Is a Roll of the Dice . The piece is all about one of my favorite sites,  urlLink It's Your Turn . It Your Turn offers turn based online backgammon, chess, checkers, go, reversi (a.k.a.  urlLink Othello ), generic versions of  urlLink Stratego ,  urlLink Scrabble ,  urlLink Battleship , and Connect 4, and dozens of variations (Chinese checkers, pente, nackgammon, Polish checkers,  dark chess ).  I started playing  urlLink back in 1999  at the urging of another friend. Five years later I am still hooked. It is the first site I check when I go online, and the last one I reload before logging off for the night. I ain't hardcore like the people interviewed by the NY Times, but I do play several games at a time with friends and family. Maybe I should start playing in those backgammon tournaments with fellow players around the globe. There's always somebody ready to play at It's Your Turn.

       A  urlLink bizarre little town  in Wisconsin can now  urlLink lay claim to the world's largest bratwurst . 48 feet of girthy goodness.  Girthy...  Okay, enough with my sausage fixation. Time to write about other things.  Girthy...

       It's been over a week since tropical storm Tingting dumped torrential rains on Guam. The effects of that storm are still being felt.  Large parts of southern Guam are still  urlLink without water . A water main broke in Santa Rita when the ground collapsed beneath it during the storm. In addition, the Ugum River water treatment plant is still closed because of clogged pumps, and a boil-water notice remains in effect for residents of Agat and Santa Rita. My water pressure in Yona is low because the booster pumps in Pago Bay are malfunctioning.  Speaking of Pago Bay, the  urlLink flooded section of Route 4  is still flooded nine days later. It was over 2 feet deep last week during the storm, but it is still four to six inches deep. I don't understand why they can't dig a trench alongside the road to divert that water into the Pago River.  The worst effect of the storm is the casualties it left behind. A total of six people were lost at sea last week during the rough surf generated by Tingting, one reefwalker and five kayakers. Searchers recovered a body last week which was originally  urlLink identified as the reefwalker . Medical examiner Dr. Aurelio Espinola identified the body as  urlLink one of the kayakers yesterday , along with another body pulled from the water  urlLink by divers on Monday . Six people lost is a terrible price to pay. I've known several people taken by the waters around Guam and my heart goes out to the families of those lost.

       Watched  urlLink  Dodgeball   yesterday. It was pretty stupid but I laughed at parts of it. I felt like checking out some more Ben Stiller, so I rented  urlLink  Zoolander   last night. Again, it was pretty stupid, but I laughed at parts of it. Upon further reflection, the target demographic for these movies is probably the same as that  urlLink 'girthy' hot dog commercial .  I needed something more substantial after all this idiocy, so I picked up  urlLink  Lost In Translation   at the same time as  Zoolander . I've been wanting to watch it, but the movie never came to Guam last year, and my local video store only has one copy on hand. I jumped at the chance to rent it yesterday.  I watched it tonight when I got home from the office. What a poignant film, two people adrift in an alien landscape. Bill Murray delivers a hell of a performance as a world-weary fading actor, and Scarlett Johansson is just luminous playing a confused young woman feeling trapped in her marriage. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I need to check out more of Sofia Coppola's work, namely  urlLink  The Virgin Suicides  .

       It looks like  urlLink John Kerry picked John Edwards  to be his vice president in the presidential election. I'm a little disappointed. It matters little to me who he picks, I'd rather vote for a blind chihuahua than George W. Bush, but I was hoping Kerry would pick the governor of Iowa. I never heard of the guy until this morning when I was listening to NPR at work. As the story unfolded about the possible running mates all I heard was something about Kerry meeting with the  urlLink Iowa governor, Tom Ballsack .  Huh??  The guy's name is Ballsack? What the hell?  Turns out his name is really Vilsack, but to the casual NPR listener on a Tuesday morning it sure sounded like that dude's name was Ballsack. For a minute I thought Kerry was targeting the same demographic as that  urlLink 'girthy' hot dog commercial . It's not such a bad idea either, since I don't think average Joe six-packs 18 to 34 in America's suburbs are a Democratic stronghold.

       I saw this really weird commercial on TV about a week ago;  urlLink a girthy hot dog commercial  from  urlLink Ball Park Franks . This fat schmuck's standing around in his back yard over the bbq grill and he's going on about how he needs a big, girthy hot dog to put into his mouth. He keeps saying 'girthy' over  and  over  and  over. There's a peculiar homoerotic thing going on here, since girthy is usually used in to refer to penises. I can't fathom how Ball Park thought making this schlub give oral pleasure to a hot dog would move the product. Jesus.  urlLink Apparently  I'm  urlLink not  the  urlLink only one  that  urlLink connotates 'girthy' with penis size ,  urlLink NPR  and  urlLink Slate  commentator Seth Stevenson agrees. The  urlLink ad is just disturbing . Maybe it was made that way to provoke a response in the target male 18-34 demographic, but I certainly don't think it puts hot dogs in a positive light.  The spot:  An obese man is tending a barbecue grill. He's cooking some Ball Park Franks. He says he likes his hot dogs "girthy." He keeps repeating that word - claiming he likes "the way it rolls off my tongue" - as he holds the frank up to his mouth; issues a guttural moan; and wraps his lips around the big, swinging dog. In all, he says "girthy" a full seven times. The commercial made me think of this babbling idiot I knew a few years ago named J.P. He was a small and insecure little human being, prone to drinking in excess and shackled with a crippling predilection for prescription narcotics. Whenever he got a little drunk, he was forever going on about how his penis was small but 'girthy,' just the thing to satisfy a woman. Frankly I didn't need that particular image and that disturbing hot dog commercial conjured up his goofball visage saying 'girthy' and staggering about in a drunken stupor with his pants down. I don't eat  urlLink tube steaks  very often but if anything, I will now avoid Ball Park Franks with a passion.

       Well lookee lookee! A brand new design for East of the Sun, West of the Moon! The idea's been in my head ever since  urlLink Blogger  tossed up a new batch of templates a couple months ago, and I finally took the plunge today. Enjoy!

       Watched two movies tonight. They both sucked.    urlLink Reign of Fire .  urlLink The Core .  Boy did they suck. I wasn't expecting much, but they were worse than I anticipated.  Reign of Fire was well nigh incomprehensible; something about dragons erupting forth from the bowels of London to reduce the world to ash and rubble. I never did quite grasp how this happened, and the movie never bothered to explain it. The dragons looked really lame too, and what the hell is Matthew McConaughey doing playing an action/adventure hero? He looked ridiculous as the mighty redneck dragonslayer, somehow transplanted from Texas to England. And stone faced Christian Bale wasn't much better, muttering lines and looking sulky throughout the movie.  The Core was a bit better, but it then had that cheesy Hollywood disaster flick thing going. Somehow watching cities leveled is not what I call great entertainment anymore, and the scene where the space shuttle crash lands shook me to  my  core. The guy from  urlLink Possession  was the hero in this movie, along with Hilary Swank as the spunky shuttle pilot (which somehow qualifies her to fly the subterranean vessel). The usual cast of expendables tags along, each meeting a uniquely gruesome death about every fifteen minutes, while the government heavies up on the surface plan some nefarious "Plan B" that will doom us all. Whatever.  Bottom line, don't bother with either of these movies. They're a waste of time.

        urlLink One of four instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope has failed .  The STIS, or Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, was installed during the second Hubble servicing mission in 1997 and was designed to work for five years.  It was used to investigate black holes, to discover dim stars that reveal clues to the age of the Universe and study the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet.  And thus begins the decline and fall of the most spectacular success of NASA's space program. It makes me all warm and fuzzy to think about the billions being poured into a worthless space station while worthwhile science founders.

        Check out this amazing discovery: Geologists have located a  urlLink gigantic geode cave in an abandoned Spanish mine . How cool is that? Geode's rarely get as large as a softball, and this one is a cave big enough to hold 10 people. Amazing. Javier Garcia-Guinea, the geologist from the Spanish Council for Scientific Research in Madrid who found the cave, can find no other reference anywhere in the world to a geode of such enormous size. The cave measures 1.8 metres wide, 1.7 metres high and spreads 8 metres long. The abundant hydrous calcium sulphate deposits, better-known as gypsum crystals, are about a half-metre in length.

       Returned to Guam yesterday morning and discovered that  urlLink regular unleaded  is now  urlLink $2.39 a gallon . Lovely. And still people are buying those gigantic SUV's that guzzle the gas. Gas prices continue to climb because demand is increasing across the planet for  urlLink a dwindling resource .  In a related story, I spent a week in Southern California recently and I was shocked by the traffic and congestion, especially the number of gigantic SUV's roaming the streets. Turns out the big SUV's are actually  urlLink banned from residential streets across the state  because they exceed 3 tons in weight, but the regulation is not enforced. Seems to me they ought to be rigidly enforcing that law, California could use the extra money the tickets would generate, and it would help curb people's appetite for enormous vehicles.

       I arrived home a little after 2:00 a.m. this morning. It's good to be back, even if my house is a mess. I'm tired, but I am happy to be back. Three weeks away was a little too long.  I spent the last few days in St. Louis visiting with my family. It was a good time, even if I forgot how beastly hot St. Louis gets in August. I need to remember, visit in the spring or fall. Summers are unbearable and winters are dismal.
