      Musicians as such are potently expressive with their music, their lyrics - instrumentation, et al. The visual side of things is almost wholly an outlet of ego, and the distinct lack of visual sophistication is especially evident in contrived band and artist photographs.   There is a palpable difference between a shot of soulful involvement in performance and just standing with the band or hamming with an instrument.  I enjoy the melodramatic exaggerated poses, the vast sweeping validity claim of standing with the gang, but does anyone else? The photograph represents such raw ego that it is almost funny. I say this first about myself, eh?  So chill out.  Now for those of you that like the written word, fear not. This is not going to be ONLY a PHOTOBLOG with brief captions. I am going to drag out all of my old publicity writing, press releases, band bios, music reviews, and all the detritus of a career failed not once, but several times.   I just didn't get it soon enough. It's a waste of time pursuing a primarily western artform in a populous asian nation. They want group gyrations and tree-hugging, not guitar soloes. DUH!  Well, it's photos for the first month at least. I'm gonna have to buy a scanner and ocr the other shyte. Enjoy, and don't laugh TOO hard. Blood sweat and tears went into all of this, and SOME of the people depicted herein are actually among the world's finest musicians.  PS: Hello is hanging so it'll only be next week. Sorry. Sigh.

       urlLink    The Lovely Ladies Club  Seminars and Programmes - 1997  These programmes will focus on many issues - in depth and with detail.  We feel that women are the most accurate barometer of a society's directions and growth on an interpersonal level.  They are the nurturers and educators of our children and the bulwark of the family unit.  While  different organisations are seeking to improve our lives and change many negative aspects and inequalities plaguing society, sexuality is forever swept under the carpet. The prevailing attitude in Indian society is that the woman should remain ignorant or perhaps just feign ignorance of one of the most fundamental parts of human relationships.  Not only is this illogical but as a result society is in for a shocking series of long-term pitfalls.  Hopefully, our eminent panelists and professionals will be able to come up with solutions that the  rest of the community can beneit from.  An expert panel of Doctors, Family Therapists, Psychologists, Sex Therapists and related health professionals will see each issue thoroughly.   Information and knowledge are power.  The power to speak freely and make necessary changes in one's own and in others lives.  This balancing of the social equation must be placed back in the hands of those who can make a difference, wives and mothers.   The topics covered in our forum will be dealt with in detail.  Lectures, bibliographies, handouts and presentations will try and illuminate the details of these isues and hopefully together we will be able to come up with some solutions.  This is above all an open forum for discussion, the sharing of views on issues which are crucial to family life and happiness but keep getting 'hidden away'   Erotic Potentials:  An informative and tasteful exploration of a woman's vast capacity for physical and emotional fulfilment in her marital life.   Tradition and cultural perspectives on womens issues.  Many aspects of personal fulfilment can be learned and taught to others.  The time of silence is over.    Contraception - modern methods and means.:  One of the integral issues, the long term emotional and physiological impact of BCP's and hormonal methods.  The pill for men?  Why is the femidom not widely available.   What every woman should know:  A no-nonsense look at the facts, an exploration of popular myths and misconceptions surrounding the sexuality of women, and what can be done on an individual and social level to create a safer, saner and more balanced society.   What makes men tick?  A look into at male sexuality and behavior.   Opening and enhancing lines of communication with the men in your life.  An exploration of the hidden male sexuality.   Psychosocial aspects of schooling:  Gender segregation and it's impact on later life.  Does gender separation during adolesence lead to the objectification of the opposite sex?  Prostitution in India:    It exists, it can't be denied.  It is one of those strange things which everybody feels has nothing to do with them.  Women all over the country are testing HIV positive, and sometimes their children as well.  AIDS takes years to manifest signs and symptoms and one drunken night can rise up years later and claim the lives of a family.  What can be done?  &nbsp; urlLink

      		INDIAN BANDSTAND          Concepts, scripting, and outline by Adam Chadmon.              Indian Bandstand ---------------- "I.B. B-cuz I. A.M."   Indian bandstand is a unique implementation of the principle of 'global thought - local action'  It is a televised program which highlights the best in local artists playing western music. It will allow for a great amount of viewer feedback, and will thus reflect the attitudes of society about music and youth culture. It's unique combination of a talk show, a critical review and a live performance serves to bring out the true character of these minstrels, maestros and madcaps who entertain us.  	As the satellite channels dig their trenches in their battle for the viewer share, they are realising the deep value of local action programming.  The pursuit of the public eye is a guerrilla war, and fought in neighborhoods and communities first.  Public opinion is a tide that swells from person to person, and high-quality, well focussed musical programming may be just the software that they are looking for.   	Much like that piece of musical history which sparked off a restless generation 'American Bandstand' I.B. features a lively mix of local music, news, 'Bangalore buzzes', and thought provoking interviews with the artists who play for you.  Our goal is to put together broadcast software with a local flavour, but with international quality and panache.  	Indian Bandstand is, quite literally, a platform from which musicians communicate.  Music is the world's common language and those who speak it should be heard.  IB also incorporates entertaining snippets, short films, and promotional spots.  Several prominent local artists have agreed to assist in set design, the short spots will feature models, actors and dancers performing short skits or routines.  Also in the pipeline is a dose of comedy.  The spotlight is definitely the bands themselves, and they haven't exactly had a fair shake:  Everybody loves the extra adrenaline and electricity of live performances, they want a band for a birthday, a wedding, New Years Eve etc...  They recognize the need that a good live act satisfies in themselves but this recognition has never filtered down to the bands themselves.  Too often it seems that the band is treated like just another piece of equipment rented for an occasion. They are inevitable the first casualty of budget cuts.  All of this, in combination with prohibitive legislation can be difficult and discouraging to an artist who loves the field enough to dedicate his life and time to playing for others.  One thing is clear, and that is that the immediate rewards are never financial.  	One of the main reasons we have come into being is to let the public know just who 'the music in their midst' is, and also to let bands know that they can become recognized for their years of hard work.  To that effect, we will also be presenting a yearly achievement award to those whom our viewers consistently selected as Bangalore's best.  We also hope to put together a collection cassette of our best performances, thereby enabling indigent artists to enter the market.  	(We are in no way discouraging the flourishing classical, light classical and 'filmi' musical subcultures.  The producers of Indian Bandstand are also supporting and generating interest in all other types of music.)  	We exist to give a voice to the many talented struggling bands in Bangalore, and across the country who haven't had their say...till now.   ------  Monthly show - 2 bands a month.  Screening criteria:   o You have to be good enough to get past the judges.   o For copyright and permission reasons, you have to play original songs. o You sign a release form allowing USN to use the material in any way that they see fit.   --------  A ROUGH OUTLINE OF A SAMPLE SHOW  General Format:  Indian Bandstand logo, title song. Short Voiceover: "You must be in the right place at the right time, because you're tuned in to Indian Bandstand, where the music never stops getting better." (change please - the  sarcasm should be obvious)  (Everything is short and sweet. Cut-cut-cut and one liners.)  Pan to the host, whom for the spoken portion is seated, but informally.   He greets the viewing audience and talks a little bit about the bands to be featured on the program.  His special guests, come in and are introduced.  They're invited to talk a little bit about themselves and what they're doing musically. Then THEY introduce the featured band.  Once every few shows you have a short segment with clips of all the bands featured to date and a dial in (fax in) vote for the IB music awards which should happen in September (so winners can be nominated elsewhere.)    SET DESIGN  Interview Set: Designed like a practice room or backstage area, amps in background, concert posters on the wall, guitars and keyboard leaning on the wall, a couple of chairs et al.  Lighting is more than a sungun, but not heavy.  Concert Set: Stage regular, audience seated and given applause cues like a proper studio audience...cue cards can be varied for effect.  Concert effects should include one smoke machine and lights.  IB NEWS Set:  Standard broadcast journalism set.  Desk, backdrop of musical staff, files on desk, cuts to clips.  Special sets: Interviews can be conducted on a theme basis too, everything should try to be as thematic as possible but not corny.  Pop music - jukebox drawing.  Heavy metal - axe and skull.    We need one plain wall and slide projector to try out 'simulated bluescreen'  -----------  SHOW TO SHOW ITEMS  The special items will come in-between the segments of the show and any commercial break.  When we cut from song to song in the performance band cuts may be needed also because it creates a very professional, polished, MTV type appeal.  When program content spans a wide range of interesting things that are under 30 seconds, everybody loves it.   Special Items:    IB Music News - a minute or two of news and new music reviews supported with clips.  Sophisticated and snazzy, no bad reviews. Suggest female journalist - Jackie Kelly?  Recorded filler segments - 30 seconds or less, I'll arrange for models and theatre actors/actresses to conduct strange little skits and visual jokes to play in-between.  Several months can be shot in days.  IB Jam clips - short segments of the 'special guest' and featured artist just jamming a few chords etc...for example if it's Jayesh from Indus Creed he could be teaching Gangamma's Pleasure 'Trapped' or 'Pretty Child'- short pieces, not whole songs, just to show that musicians support each other because they share a common language.  'USN asks you' - Quick Interviews with the public asking about local music, how they feel about the music scene, which was their best rock show, etc...  Ideally shot once a month with permission at some major Pub who is a USN subscriber.  Viewers Polls on various issues (30 seconds)- Human rights, Environmental Pollution, Traffic Jams and overpopulation, AIDS, World Affairs etc... (to show that music has a valid voice and a deep concern about people and society.  It will also really tie in regular USN viewers.)  IB UNPLUGGED - Get each band to sit and do at least one song acoustically for a variety mix later on.  IB MUSIC AWARDS - For best local performance artist.  A yearly contest decided by USN Viewers.  Winners will be nominated for a minor category in some bigger music award ceremony like the MTV or Onida.   THE PERFORMANCES  The important part of this whole project, the performances, will be 90 % of the show.  o They will take place at a regular venue with a large, but controllable 'studio audience' The audience knows that they're a studio audience and will be dressed and behave themselves for the occasion.  o Applause cues will be given to the audience and reaction shots taken.  Specialised cue cards like 'Whistle' and 'Yeah' can really make it look like your audience is awesome and involved.  o The backdrop behind the band should not have any logos or sponsors banners or international restrictions will prevent satellite channels from airing it. But the 'event' can be draped.  o Staff and manpower to handle things for the event can also be assisted by the band's appointees.  Responsibilities can be delegated and shared.  o The special guests will be seated in VIP style in the front row so 'reaction shots' can be taken.  o The total time for a band should not be more than 45 minutes on tape. As the show is live, they can doodle a bit and do a cover tune or two that won't be shot.  o The print advertisements should be for the event at first.  A per person cost of 35 bucks should be charged to defray venue cost chair rental etc.  A bag of popcorn and a pepsi can go a long way.  o Let the record companies know about it and give them a table to set up any promotional material they want known.  o Let's offer radio rights to Mid-Day or Times FM, they both have offices set up and ready to roll - give or take a few years  of paperwork.  SAMPLE ADVERTISEMENT:  "INDIAN BANDSTAND PRESENTS 'JELLY SLIME' and 'PEANUT BUTTER JAM'  Indian Bandstand is holding a televised rock show on the 18th of February.

Mar 2nd Editing suite Mar 3d Edited episode is ready. ----------------------------  SOME IDEAS FOR CONJUNCTION SCRIPTS:  A:  'The classroom series' (5)  A stern, angry old headmaster is in front of a blackboard with a pointer.  He never speaks but his lesson is always clearly written and he points to it.  A whiny student's voice shot from behind a boy's arm held in the air asks questions about life, music and the universe.  The answer should always be a meaningful cliche or vaguely nebulous.  example:   Boy : "Sir! Sir! Can you explain to me the difference between the Ego and the Collective Unconscious?" Headmaster: (with a deep and knowing smile points to the blackboard.  Camera pans to "THE MAP IS NOT THE TERRITORY." back to HM who nods sagely.)  [Where do babies come from?  I want to be just like Michael Jackson  Do you ever wonder what god looks like?]   B:  'You're under arrest' (5) Borrow a couple of police uniforms and have them arresting people from various walks of life for silly things.  example:  Cop #1: "Don't move! You're under arrest." Cop #2: "Take his arms." A musician: "What have I done, was I playing too loud?" Cop #1: : "Worse than that.  Playing more than 3 Beatle songs with an out of tune guitar is a serious offense!"  Cop #2 : "They will lock you up and throw away the key!"    (too involved?)  [drunken derelict (Do we really need a reason?) , lawyer (But I uphold the law - we know. , someone's mother (Because Babu has been a very naughty boy)]  C: 'Battle of the Sexes:'(8) Strange costumes, odd makeup and two lines, one spoken by a woman, one spoken by a man.  It should vary, have really strange background music or sound effects and basically be a trip.  examples:  She: "You are the pale shadow of some noble ideal long forgotten." He: "You are but a lime-green afterbirth dancing your way to shame." They were staring into space but they look at each other suddenly after the last line and jerk their heads back in shock.   She: (they speak simultaneously) "But I wanted sexuality with safety, security, warmth, intimacy, affection, tenderness..." He: "But I wanted tenderness, affection, intimacy, warmth, security, safety, sexuality..." They look at each other with wonder as their jaws drop open.   D: 'Mummy says' (4) A fat smiling matronly woman in a very homely environment gives her advice on Love and Marriage.  examples:  Mummy: (grinning in extreme close-up, pulls back fixes hair.) "Oh Bettah, you are late for dinner again...your friends are such awful fellows keeping you from your food.  You have become so thin. (shows a pudgy finger)  You're not eating - here let me feed you (picks up a giant spoon of dhal-chawal)  Just take one bite...come on, (approaches camera).  Train coming chuk-chuk choo-choo open the tunnel yum yum  (fade)  Mummy : (Close-up again, she is wringing her hands.) "If two people are in love, if they are like-minded, if it is late at night and if they are alone, I think they should go for it! They should play all night. It doesn't matter if you're black or white.  What two people do when they are alone together is their own business but  Mummy always says playing chess and checkers builds character. "  E: Goof Clips (5) foul ups, bleeps, and blunders from the recording of the others.  F: Dance segments (5) Short, choreographed, stylised dance routines with several dancers shot against a plain wall with a slide projector on them and the Bandstand theme playing.

       urlLink    Interactive Artist Management (MUSIC)   A rose by any other name...  Adam Chadmon, IAM's architect and CEO has been working in entertainment and the arts for almost a decade now, and feels that the growth rate of the entertainment industry (apart from Cine and television) is exaggerated in the media, it's financial returns to investment ratio is bad, and it is currently unhealthy.  Interactive Artist Management is a new concept designed not to strip-mine, but to revitalise and renovate the way that people perceive art and artists of all types.  Our goal is the expansion of the narrow boundaries imposed upon art by society and by the associated industries themselves. Interactive management implies total self empowerment of the artists, whose creative self expression is channeled into organisational and practical capacities as well.  This gives each band that IAM works with a separate and distinct corporate, as well as artistic identity.  IAM's goal is empowerment, and each of our clients has completed a gamut of legal documents creating the band, group, orchestra, artist as an entity capable of legal action, lawsuits, and basically able to get tough if someone tries to take advantage of them.  IAM policy is to create a separate music company for each client, in whose name all copyrights, music, lyrics and intellectual property is registered.  IAM's lawyers and agents are not hired by a single client, but by the firm itself pursuing the needs of the few and the goals of the whole. Representation is the best available.  IAM allows work with as many other managers/agencies that the artist is willing to support.  We only ask that no signed artist can accept a contract from any other company for more than nine months.  This is a defensive measure, because this is exactly the time-frame in which one can evaluate the future potential of a commercial relationship.  Goals and promises have to come true within a realistic time limit.  IAM's contracts will have the same time limit, and the company reserves the right to terminate based on grounds of non-payment, contract infraction, poor discipline, and band dissolution.  Creative consultation, legal advice, chartered accountancy, publicity, photography , promotion and creative strategy are all benefits of working with IAM.  Our promotional strategies, materials, and methodologies have been controversial but seemingly the most effective available.  Talent is the sole responsibility of the client.  IAM's fees are directly proportional to it's involvement.  This fee should logically be a percentage of received performance fees, endorsement amounts and sales profits, but in the event of a long 'dry' period, is subject to band decision. All financial decisions are arrived on by band leader and member/shareholder consensus. IAM is not greedy or manipulative, it's aim is to let the creative force which brings a band alive run the band, and decide it's own policy.  IAM provides ideas, organisation, and marketing/promotion.  IAM is not here to be paid for nothing at all, and if prominent shows, albums, etc... hinge upon a contract with another management company, the client is free to try the option.  IAM will still be present.   IAM may be a new concept, and a new company, but the creative impetus behind it is Adam Chadmon.  Adam, at the ripe old age of twenty-six, is already a potent force in the industry.  Having a sizeable web of contacts, informants, and liaison agents in most major firms in show biz  he simply gets results.  His innovative marketing approaches have been called the most controversial in Asia, but he seems to get pretty decent attention.  IAM is modular, project specific, innovative, and provided it's tenets are maintained, may even be purchased by another company, if the benefits to our clients outweigh the disadvantages.   IAM makes it possible for clients to concentrate on perfecting and performing their art, rather than worrying about the day to day business routines involved in the promotion and marketing or their product.  IAM uses temporary project architecture to maximize results and minimize expenditure.  All necessary forms and contracts are pre-prepared for everything from incorporation, event contracts, sponsorship applications to intinerary planning and of course: four pages in the IAOM monthly newsletter sent to the four corners of the industry highlighting our clients.  It's all handled for you, and IAM doesn't hesitate to put things in the proper perspective: the industry is a nouveauphilic machine. If presentation is direct and simple within the conduits and guidelines of industry insiders, there is not that much to be done.  A good product sells itself.  It is only when dealing with mediocrity that the struggle sets in.  IAM doesn't believe mediocre performance artists help the industry at all.  Self-financed musicians, companies that release demo cassettes as finals, artists who work on a company shoestring to flop away the taxman...these are cancer to the business.  We prefer our clients to be the best at what they do.Tat Tvam Asi  	The TTA division of IAM (music) is exclusively concerned with the marketing and promotion of musicians within the domestic and foreign markets for Indian Classical music.  In the course of our experience over the past few years we have dealt with many musicians in the booming cine recording industry.  It's a lucrative field, it attracts the most skilled and ambitious performers and of course is a very competitive arena. IAM is concerned with the gamut: vocalists, instrumentalists, percussionists, technical wizards with vast arsenals of high-tech equipment and even experienced engineers whose deft touches and sensitive ears can work with these subtle sounds.  We want to make our large library of talent available to:  Record companies looking for new sounds and creative projects in the "New Age" "Living Masters" and "Relaxation" categories. Artists and Musical groups needing a knowledgable classical performer to perform, arrange or just overdub.  Companies creating CD-Roms for international use.  Major Labels needing to add a touch of classical to their projects.  Cine Music Directors in the United States, Europe, Australia and South America who want to utilise an Indian Classical repertoire.   TTA will handle individual publicity, catalog distribution, project and contract negotiations, troubleshooting, and project specific organisation.  TTA will also provide chartered accountancy and legal counsel as and when needed.  We will keep the schedules and fees of our artists current and help clients pinpoint their needs.  Our major concern is the efficient and accurate connection of performer and client.     Quick Creativity Quis Custodies  - Ipso Custodiet?  	The QC division of IAM is the special projects arm.  As the IAM (music) creative agency it serves to coordinate and organise several types of project for people and organisations wanting to present their ideas in audiovisual format.  QC projects include :  	Hypnosis, self-help, and psycho-acoustic programmes 	Audio books 	Dramatised audio programmes 	Devotional music  	Educational and A/V presentations 	The production music videos 	Short films and visual sketches for directorial debuts 	Finding the right voice for clients 	 	Apart from IAM's in-house projects, QC will also provide a creative engine to breathe life into a clients idea.  We can organise and administrate any of the above projects.  With copywriting, audio-production, original music, design and duplication taken care of, the client can sit back, relax and concentrate on enhancing the creative aspects of their ideas.     International Association Of Musicians  IAM is organising and sponsoring a discussion group and A&R forum open to all musicians everywhere.  A non-profit division of IAM the IAOM is to be a loosely structured, purposely informal 'pow-wow.' The IAOM will meet at regular intervals in a casual setting and discuss issues and happenings, concerts and music, artistic exchanges etc... It will serve as an open forum for musicians to present opinions and perhaps try to solve the manifold problems in the field. The IAOM will network with other similar associations through the Internet and attempt to put creative minds in touch across borders. The structure of processes within the IAOM will remain free-form with participation and presentation left entirely to individual discretion.  It will provide an easy way for people in music to meet people in music, whether performer, industry professional, or amateur artist.  Registration of members will provide a comprehensive mailing list and database of people who care about the future of music.  IAOM will also put together a volunteer committee to provide gratis administration for collaborative social awareness and charity projects. Putting a little music into society can only benefit us all.  THE JOURNAL  A trade journal, BUZZ, will launch in 1998.  It will be provided free of charge to registered IAOM members, the print media, satellite channels, and record labels.  Bangalore Underground ZZ  Those musicians who write will be asked to provide articles on their opinions, pet peeves, gossip, little known facts about the business of being a working musician, news, reviews and original songs/lyrics.  BUZZ will also ask knowledgeable journalists to contribute their writings in the field, as well as paraphrase and reprint relevant articles (with permission) from the popular media.  The journal will interview leading figures in the industry, experienced performers, and those artists just visiting India.  There will even be a section for fan mail.  Of course, in keeping with modern technocracy, BUZZ will circulate across the globe on the Internet.  The BUZZ homepage will invite contribution from other countries as well as exchanging ideas, helping our homegrown music play it's part in the global orchestra.   WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE USE OF ANY MATERIAL IN THIS JOURNAL. WE DO HUMBLY REQUEST THAT YOU MENTION BUZZ IF YOU DO, CUZ THAT'LL HELP US KEEP PROVIDING YOU MORE TOTALLY HIP, EMINENTLY USABLE LOW COST COPY.     	HEY YOU!  DO YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MUSIC?

Ten Simple Reasons why your band should sign with IAM now:  o IAM's contracts are not long tight hassles, they are short, clear MOU format mutually dissolvable agreements.  o IAM's percentage of payment is less than half of any Management, Marketing and Promotion package in the world.  o With a management company behind you, you become a professional band which is sometimes a necessary shift in perspective.  With someone looking to get you shows there is actually money to be made.  o You probably need a photo session done.  o You probably don't have an international level press kit.  o As part of IAM you will have brother and sister bands to communicate and work with in an otherwise hostile industry. Deals only happen under the same umbrella.   o IAM will be co-ordinating photo-sessions and demo recordings for bands under our umbrella. Studio bookings, cassette duplications and printing all become cheaper when you club your jobs together. Save some money.  o IAM's trip is not telling you what to do, IAM's trip is giving you all the resources and information to effectively manage yourself.  o IAM is not just taking care of bands, it is handling visual artists, poets, actors, writers, sculptors, literally any type of artist who wants to make their presence felt.  Who knows what will happen when so many creative minds hook up?   o Being signed with IAM not only keeps the sharks away if you strike gold, it makes your price to another Management company much higher. If they're interested and you're interested, then IAM will negotiate a killer deal for you.  Apart from these ten points which I hope you read carefully, the other thing is that as part of IAM, you don't actually have to do anything.  For example, almost any management company will try to contractually oblige you to work in Hindi.  The worst IAM will do is call you and bug you if you're not practising enough. What IAM wants to do is help you find the niche that's yours and let you explode into existence.  Every time you explode, so do we. Cool huh?BUZZ will be coming out on the second week of every month, so that we are not too far behind the times on current events, shows etc...This is an outline of the contents.  We're going to run at cost level.  Our print runs will be small, but BUZZ's synchronistic hum and feline tongue will ensure francophilic kisses in exactly the right spots.    BUZZ CLASSIFIEDS  Everyone charges too much for classified ads.  Ours are cheap. In fact, they're free.  Pay us only if your ad works.  Can't beat that deal. We may not have the circulation of the Deccan Herald, but BUZZ likes to think that what we lack in numbers we compensate for in efficiency. Your messages will build up a nice head of synchronistic steam and through delicate currents in the temporo-spatial web they are guaranteed to reach the right person or we'll refund your money. Oops. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  BUZZ PERSONALS  Personal ads have a stigma attached to them, and most of the glossies that solely run them seem a little on the sleazy side. BUZZ just wants to put you in touch with like minded individuals with shared interests.  We'll print the romantic ones, we'll print the sleazy ones, we'll even print sheer desperation.  Just be cool and the attractive mechanics of the universe will do everything.  Remember, BUZZ is not just a journal, it's a vibration. We've decided to charge a twenty buck flat rate for personals just so our editorial office can afford coffee.  Include a contact phone, we won't print it, but we'll need it to notify you.    Examples:  Looking for a fellow grunge-puppy to spend some time with.  Love Alice, Nirv, Pearl, Stone, SoundG.  Herb friendly. You're a girl?  Even better. - Weasel  I saw you at Pecos on the 1st.  Red shirt, flowing raven hair. Help me to forget your eyes... - Keats  Wild and crazy girl is looking for a big brother to be her chauffeur.  Drive me around, spend money on me, I'd love it.  No sex, no attachments.  - Amaryllis  Female bodyguard, 5' 10" 180 lbs. NiDan Karate.  I'll watch over my cunning linguist against all odds. - Felice   ---------------------  The Vision Angelic   BUZZ's exlusive cartoonist, Angelo will make his point on this, his page.  In fact he's so good that his uncle Abu Abraham said that young Angelo is better than he was. Careful what you say or he might draw you too.   ----------------------  IAOM update.  These are the pages donated to the International Association Of Musicians.  They will present highlights from IAOM meetings, review members and bands that are part of IAOM, schedule jam-sessions and meetings, and serve as the voice of the Association.  GIGS will share the page.  ----------------------  VISUAL BUZZ  This is the page where our in-house video guru, Venky, cheers and jeers the latest visual offerings on our sainted music channels. You've seen lots of album reviews right?  Videos sell the albums and it's about time someone put a knowledgeable foot down in the midst of all the hype. (Use tall grass to get it out of the treads.) Venky loves MTV but he's promised us he won't be biased.  ---------------------  RANTS  Here are two pages of reader-generated funk which we hope will get down and dirty.  Is there something you dont like? Has someone done something to piss you off?  No names please, graphic descriptions should suffice. This is your anonymous shot back.  Be a coward. Hide behind a pen name and take cheap shots at your enemies.  "The pass said ACCESS ALL AREAS, I didn't know they meant mine..." BUZZ will protect your identity at all costs...until we're offered some beer.  In keeping with BUZZ tradition, only the best submissions will be printed.  (Unless we only get one) Humor, biliousness, eloquence, and rationale are the areas to beef up.  ---------------------  RAVES  Two more magic pages proving that BUZZ readers are the literati of the Garden City.  This is where you extol the virtues of anything which you'd like to.  Heard a local band that pressed some nice buttons?  Got a new 'Presidents' album that no one else has?  Think that she has a perfect geometry of mind and body?  Want to rave about Kumble's earrings? Let us all know. Humour, clarity, eloquence and rationale are how we will let our pencils do the walking.  ---------------------  A TOUCH OF CLASS  BUZZ is not Rolling Stone, we think that Hindustani and Carnatic Classical offer some of the best buzzes to be found in music. Our classical reviewer will profile one classical master per issue and suggest what he feels are their best recorded performances for listening.  ----------------------  BUZZ MUSIC  The inevitable music reviews.  We will select classic and contemporary albums and tell you why we think they're excellent.  What we dont like we're not going to bother and mention.  This is strictly hip, no hype. This is not a new music review page with BUY NOW after every review, that's the next one.  -------------------------  NEW RELEASES  This is how all of us at Buzz are going to get free tapes from major record companies.  If they're good, we'll tell you. If they're not, we'll put sticky tape over the slots and record stuff that deserves the space.  Our policy is not to slam anything unless it really really really really asks for it. Your job, dear reader is to slam what you don't like.  We're all ears.  ---------------------------  Head Shrinker  This is our pop psychology department.  No sales are final. Believe it or not, BUZZ has an expert consultant from the Jung Institute of Swiss fame.  We think we know everything but we may even ask her advice at times.  Would you like to know why your father picks his nose and wipes it on the wall by the toilet? Ask away and we will struggle for an answer.  Anything redundant will be redirected to our Rock and Roll doctor.    --------------------------   Rock The Vote   Readers views on sociopolitical issues, legislative follies, and other controversy.  We, the people define society if I'm not mistaken. We have found the enemy, and he is us.  Suggest some solutions to indiscriminate power cuts, early curfews, prohibitive legislation etc...  -------------------------  Lyrics  Three pages of your original songs, poems, and chord progressions.  New music and new poetry are the best sign that we're not dead yet.  Keep writing and maybe the millennium will recede.   Rock and Roll Doctor.  This is a column where you get to ask experienced pros about  your lifestyle and it's impact on your health. A simplification of the forum would be: Sex, drugs, and Rock and Roll Doctor. Get the picture? Buzz will research, interview and fabricate - going to any lengths to answer your question.  Samples:   Dear Rock and Roll Doctor,  I have heard that some women like to sit on top of a man when making love.  Does this mean she has sadistic feelings, and what can I do about them?  -  Anand J.   R&RD: You seem a bit imprecise in your transition between 'some women' and 'she has.'  We think you've been a bad boy. There hasn't been that much practice here at BUZZ HQ in quite some time, so our advice is not to look a gift horse in the mouth. We do hear that the Female Dominant position has been known to reduce the risk of pregnancy, prolong orgasm in the male, and allow easy manual access to all pleasure buttons.  As long as you're not too sore the next day, we wouldn't call it S&M.  Consensual Adults meetings are being held at the Jockey Club on fridays -ed.  Hi Rock and Roll Doctor, What is LSD and why do people act like it's a mystery if you haven't had it?  LSD is a chemical discovered by Albert Hoffman for Sandoz.  He discovered it accidentally during one of his explorations in the artifical synthesis of psilocybin, a psychedelic fungus. It's full name is dextro-lysergic acid di-ethylamide tartrate 25. The pharmaceutical classification into which these fall are 'hallucinogens' , literally: chemicals which make you see things, or 'psychotomimetics:' a substance which causes symptoms of psychosis.  Hallucinogens are banned all over the world, with the exception of marijuana which is medically used and socially accepted in many countries. LSD can be mass-produced in millions of doses by any graduate chemistry student worth his sodium, which is why the procedure has been obfuscated and kept secret. Dosages are measured in millionths of a gram, it is odourless, colourless, and tasteless. The medical community generally views LSD and all hallucinogens as indirect health hazards.  LSD works in a strange way, softening psychological imprints, conditioned behaviour, and stereotypes and allowing the person 'tripping' to engage in selective re-imprinting. (See programming and meta-programming the human biocomputer, John Lilly) One pan-effect of the substance is the perception of society and interpersonal relations as a series of games, most of which are unnecessary and vestigial.  Doctors Timothy Leary and John Lilly both found LSD clinically safe and tremendously useful in their avant garde psychological studies before it was banned by international government initiatives.  The rule is that 'dosage, set, and setting' all have a deep effect on the type of experience induced.  Expectation colours the whole experience deeply and in all of the studies conducted at Harvard Medical School under Professor Leary, strict controls were observed.  No ill effects resulted other than high blood pressure among administrative faculty.  Very much like a bird hatching from it's shell and imprinting the external world, LSD causes extremely deep bonds between those who 'travel' together.  Many of the inner experiences it causes are inexplicable within the confines of language, thus knowing looks and smiles are often the only way to share the depths to which one has plumbed the subconscious.  The enhancement of socio-psychological perspectives caused by repetitious self-administration of LSD has been said to be profound.  With this depth of perspective comes new responsibilities to oneself and others.  Together with incredibly stiff legal penalties and vigilant, disproportionate attention in this area given by law-enforcement, this may explain the cliquishness.  LSD is too strong a medicine for a stable obedient consumer society so the powers that be have largely replaced it with the more visceral, less insightful 'Ecstasy' or MDMA.  MDMA is the most commonly abused synthetic hallucinogen in the world and is said to cause childlike behaviour, feelings of awe, and strong emotions.  A typical evening on MDMA has the person 'tripping' drinking and dancing until they're exhausted, thus it tends to lack the insights and intellectual dimension of LSD.  Excerpted from "Garbage In, Garbage Out:" Drugs, Mind & Society. by Adam Chadmon, Bootleg Press 1996    Dear Rock and Roll Doctor, What is this mysterious drug Ibogan? I heard about it a few years ago on television.  - Maya M.  Ibogaine is a drug derived from a rare African tree, Tabarnanthe Iboga. It was discovered by anthropologists who observed that tribal hunters who took the drug were able to stay absolutely immobile and conscious for up to 8 hours when stalking prey.  It has only recently been discovered by medicine and was banned by the United States within weeks of its synthesis. The revolutionary thing about Ibogaine is that its therapeutic potential has stood out from its first day of clinical studies.  In the experiments which took place in The Netherlands in the 80's there was a 75% cure rate in trials with alcoholics and an even higher rate with heroin addicts.  Many took the drug only once.  The remarkable thing is that follow up studies after the drug was banned by the EEC show a less than 10% rate of recidivismsm. It seems to fundamentally interfere with psychological addiction patterns.  The typical 'trip' on ibogaine involves a little of the classic psychedelic experience: colour changes, perception of geometric visual patterns etc... but the similarity ends there.  While no psychedelic experience can ever be uniform, the test subjects who took it experienced detailed hallucinations similar to dreams, in which they relived (in reverse) all of their most significant moments in life.  They re-lived situations in which they had made life impacting decisions, and were allowed to make the 'other choices' and see how their lives would have changed correspondingly.  After 6 to 8 hours of this reversal of time, most had achieved profound insights into who they were and how they had evolved through life. Many wept. Few would volunteer to try the drug again.   Excerpted from "Garbage In, Garbage Out:" Drugs, Mind & Society. by Adam Chadmon, Bootleg Press 1996    Dear Rock and Roll Doctor, What are 'Smart Drugs' and are they safe? - C.N.S.  Smart drugs are long term theraputic chemicals which increase the brain's efficiency in information absorption, retention, and recall.  The most commonly used 'smart drugs' are Hydergine (co-dergocrine mesylates), Piracetam, Vasopressin and Gingko Biloba Extract.  They are prescribed singly or in combination to patients who suffer from Alzheimers or other memory-affective diseases, people who have sustained severe head injuries, and people who have poor cerebral vasodilation.  What the literature neglects to mention is that while they can help a person with a problem function normally, they can work as cerebroenergetic enhancers, helping the normal person achieve 'enhanced CPU speed and better information processing.'  The main problem with 'smart drugs' is not physiological.  There are no dependencies no contra-indications and the worst noted side effects of two have been nausea and dizziness. They have been studied for decades and no health hazards have become evident.  They are just prohibitively expensive and sometimes in short supply.  The abuse potential exists simply because a doctor will not prescribe them to an ambitious student or professional or even a person simply seeking to maximize his own potential.  Smart drug users are often self-educated on the topic and self medicating.  New research and progressively enlightened social attitudes will perhaps one day help us all achieve our full potential. Ayurveda and Naturopathic researches are revealing a host of new 'smart drugs' which occur naturally.  While these have not been researched as thoroughly, they seem to have great potential in making smart drugs cheaper and legal, much like multi-vitamin supplements early in this century.

      I spent time last night doing something I don't usually do.  Not since I was younger and more frivolous.  Let me recommend it to all of you. At&nbsp;least once a month. Learn something about your neighbor, and you might learn something about yourself...&nbsp; &nbsp;  I looked at porn.  Not the overproduced, needs oriented, seven foot Amazons with steroid jaws and rubber tits and big hair stuff, but fringe, almost clean stuff.  &nbsp;  Not the whole night either, but a segment of it.  I enjoyed it, but hardly in a 'get off' kind of way.  I am as desperate for intimacy, as are we all - no denial of that. Although I like pictures on a screen for many reasons - I cannot confuse them for the real thing. &nbsp; That is the difference between myself and Senator X from Minnetonka.  For him even the mention of the thing is the thing. Poor guy, even the thought of the thing must be the thing. Wouldn't want to be him. Who exactly is voting for these creeps?   There was content both savoury and unsavoury. I remember something about collegesucks, and polaroids, but one stuck in my head - a site called http://my bodypart.com/ where people put photos of their body part of choice and strangers rate them. It's pornography at times, tasteful self-portraits occasionally, pictures of hands and necks and noses - one chap was enthralled with a giant nose, must have been an eskimo in a past life...   These are mostly amateurs, people who want to post themselves on the web. It is semi-commercial, fueled by ads and gimmicks - as is Star TV and Hollywood for that matter. I realized what it was doing for me. It was re-connecting me with a sense of myself as a sexual being. My living and working environment doesn't allow that. Everybody pretends. All the time. Even with their loved ones. It is so bizarre - the contrast between "look at my pretty butt" and "seventeen layers of clothing and still i'll walk stiffly away from you."  Especially when you realize that nature has very little to do with the latter attitude.  &nbsp;  So this energy is stifled en masse, and produces huge populations, epidemics, mass hysteria and hosts of other symptoms. It is common coin that repressed sexuality becomes violence. It is then, by my terribly twisted way of thinking - rather dangerous to deny the largest mobs in the world both egress of instinct and self-knowledge that enables that. Perhaps somebody vain wants uniforms on all of them, a solutions which is only temporary. It at the very least results in the mistreatment of children and small animals, which in my opinion is a poor trade off for "No Hustler."  America is equally hypocritical. Aussies are non-committal, slightly on the permissive side. Canadians are liberal socially and sexually conservative - which strikes a balance. Why are Europeans the only ones allowed freedom of thought? The thing about American hypocrisy is that it has become true hypocrisy. People hide from each other, but have somewhere to turn - even the dumb ones.   Asian repression is deep enough that some people, maybe even most people, the mean, the masses, the not-too-bright, think it's real. They torture themselves thinking "I'm the only one with this mad obsession for feet, what on earth shall I do? - I know, I'll start a movement against sex. Socks for the poor I'll call it."   They spend their whole lives actually believing that their naked bodies are something filthy and disgusting. Struggling with feelings we all have and not only pretending they don't exist - finding the honest and punishing them for expressing their opinions. Or exposing their titties. They cannot know what it is like to be a teenager in Sweden.   Who's asking anyone to change? Just be your soul. If your trip involves interfering with mine however, prepare to get gory. There is a reason our wise wise forefathers invented this whole concept of freedom of speech. I don't mind repeating myself when I say, the roots of fascism lie in the very suppression of the sexual instincts. The first books in the bonfire are the naughty books and everyone stands around feeling holy for ten seconds. Then they look around for something else. Not while I breathe. &nbsp;  &nbsp; We all know the quote&nbsp;from Voltaire, but education, nutrition, and the sharing of ideas in an information society have led more than just one man to follow him. I amy be an eloquent fool, but I am not alone. You stand against the forces of nature, the very thing that gave you birth. It is you who are filthy and twisted and perverse, not the libertine, not the tart, not the whore. &nbsp; This mass denial is literally at war with the information age. For every anti-sex crusader of any kind I can set up a forum and put them face to face with a dozen of their personal satans. Their solutions range from pulling the plug on all media (taliban tactics) or only allowing you cola, American style: "Look you're free! You can choose Coke or Pepsi!"   Anyway, it's another same ol' rant so I'll do something different.  For myself.  &nbsp;  I refuse to post my nekkid form amidst the skanks and spam, but blogger is a fine way to go "au naturale"  If you are faint of heart close your eyes now.  &nbsp;  Heh. The threat is enough. Imagine I did the unspeakable. There we go.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Perhaps if I use this head of my blog-ness for scans of my paintings and digital visuals et al - it wont create that interference pattern. This perhaps true of reception as well as the send. Pictures of my beautiful donkey next to pictures of my beautiful wife with "Old McDonald" playing in the background and all the baby Aschcrofts will be getting angry little soft-ons. Lose ya? Ne'er mind - you'll get it.
