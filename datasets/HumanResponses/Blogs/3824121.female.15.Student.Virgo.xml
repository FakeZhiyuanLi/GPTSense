      Have you noticed that the only way an animated movie will do super good and be extermely loveable is if something tragic and sad happens?  Lets take that movie by dreamworks, Spirit.  Now that just had tragedy all over the place. 1st he gets captured then he escapes. After he escapes he gets REcaptured and falls in love with that pretty little horse Rain. Then Rain  falls over the side of a waterfall AND DIES!  After that, he's taken (he got captured AGAIN!!!) to pull a train over a mountain so they can run a railroad into his old home. Luckliy he survives  and discovers Rain has survived as well. Now, they run off into the sunset back to his homeland. That scene gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside the entire time I watch it. Did I mention that soundtrack ROCKS.  Next, we have Mulan. (I'm planning on making this my layout once I get a chance to)That soundtrack also rocks, I still love refelection to this day!!! Now, that was sad when she realized that her father would die if she went to war. So she cuts off most of her hair, dawns his armor and runs off for the armor. After she does that her father runs after her in the rain and falls. It was SAD!!!  Then there was Nemo. If you haven't seen Nemo yet, go!!! Go see it!!! The poor fish got fishnapped!!! NNNEEEMMMOOOO!!!  And, the all time SADDEST and BEST animated movie, the Lion King. I still can't believe they killed Mufasa. I cried the first time I saw that.  He was such a cool lion. And the way he died suck. Screw you Scar, SCREW you!!!!!  I loved Mufasa!  Now that I think about it....animated movies seemed to be much to sad for children. Just, to damn sad for the poor little picknees

My goodness! I loved it! and its not even done yet. *cries* It leaves off in the worst possible place. Stupid purgatory arc! >

      Being a woman sucks, times a million. Why wasn't I borne a boy, huh? I can't get over the fact that&nbsp;for a woman, a filmsy little shirt that looks like a scrap of fabric cost like $100 and some heavy material that would take decades to make cost like $20. Its not fair!!!!  If you add up the price of makeup, pads, tampons,&nbsp;headache tablets, cramp tablets, CHOCOLATE, and fluffy pillows,&nbsp; women are doomed to live in depth (And thats just what women buy in ONE month, FOR ONE WEEK! Its not worth it!)  I can't wait for menopause. Oh let me stop there before I start going on and on about child birth. I swear during the ordeal I would kill my husband, I would kill him and he would never touch my again.&nbsp;  Men, I just wanna say, you better watch out XD

      I have some very good, yet bad news, The so so: My aunt got in an accident last night and had to be air lifted to the hospital. Luckly she is very much alive.&nbsp; Things are kind of the same over here. Oh! last night I was gonna die cause I heard a tapping on the glass. I did the absolutely natural thing and ran like hell.&nbsp; My sister doesn't believe me though.&nbsp;   On second note, this house is starting to get to me. I close my eyes at night and wonder if when I wake up if things will be this bad?&nbsp; Also, I finally updated my fic, Angels and Demons. :-) I'm gonna start my next couple of chapters soon. I have this cool idea for a dieing scene that I am going to post right here, right about now....:  &nbsp;*He stood as soon as the dust cleared. He was hurting all over. But he had to see her. He had to&nbsp;know she was okay. He braced himself and made his way to&nbsp;her body. She was turned on her side, skin coated in blood. What little skin he cold see was pale and lifeless.&nbsp;He touched her just a bit and lifted her into her arms in one swoop. He turned around and made his way to the city. The sun was setting in the distance.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lite green eyes opens and stared into his own dark ones. "Hey there lover." She whispered &nbsp;&nbsp; "Shush, don't say a word, everything gonna be alright." &nbsp;&nbsp; "It beautiful isn't it?" &nbsp;&nbsp; "What is?" &nbsp;&nbsp; "The song, I can hear people singing" He looked down at her. She was smiling. A small beautiful smile.&nbsp;It was the first time he had seen her smile like that. "Mama's coming baby, mama's coming." She whispered before closing her eyes.&nbsp; He held her, for just one minute, before falling and letting himself die.*  &nbsp; Not so good, I know, it happens sometimes XP

      Right now my creativeness is going kabooom? Its sizziling up and i'm so afraid i won't be able to make a portfolio when the time comes. *cries* But besides that I'm bored. I've almost been down to the point where I am about to write a couple of fanfics. I haven't written a fanfic in YEARS. Maybe it'll do me some real good.

      I just found out where I can download some lovely, lovely anime. Sadly,&nbsp;I have to wait till I get that thing in my room that allows two computers to be on a network. Till then all downloads are at a halt. Could you believe that at this VERY moment I could be&nbsp;preparing to watch the 2nd Inuyasha movie??? or the 152 episode? or i could be watching bomberman. I'm gonna go look for my song, iris to put it on this thingy.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  days till school: 27 days till birthday: 42

      I need&nbsp; some seriously new anime and manga. Screw Sim 2. I'm gonna go ask for money so I can run to the store to buy some seriously good manga. Or I'll borrow some from the libray. I was SO shocked when I realized that I could rent manga from the libray.&nbsp; Sadly out of order. Or maybe in order, I havent searched hard enough. I think i'll go back later. Maybe, somewhere, someway, I can download some lovely anime, like Naruto or the actual Inuyasha. (Mental yay dance) &nbsp; On a second note look at this. Isn't it adorable: &nbsp;   &nbsp; hehehehehe!! &nbsp; Days till school: 28 Days till birthday: 43

      Hello!!! I'm getting ready to watch Def Poetry thingy in a minute. I just saw the 4400. IT WAS GOOOD! I love 4400. The days was a disappointment cause it was boring. Hopefully, desperate housewives and lost shall not follow in its footsteps.  &nbsp;  As accordance&nbsp;with the laws of teenagers (I swear I shall draw this&nbsp;up by tomarrow)&nbsp;I begin my countdowns starting now:  &nbsp;  Days till school: 29  Days till birthday: 44

      Its starting to take my blog FOREVER to update. I guess its just getting bigger and bigger. Damn, yo, sometimes I wish I could draw. I have such great ideas and no where to put them. Do you know how fustrating that is? I also wanna do a webcomic. ^^(), sometimes I can be very, very creative. I'm thinking of adding another blog to my account and you know, post stories there and stuff. I wonder if anyone would read it, they'd probably think my junk was terrible! Hehehehehe. Anyway, i'm gonna go set it up and make it pretty, and, um stuff. :D, I found this Lilo and Stitch icon that I wanna post up, but I deleted hello and the image server I use blogger doesn't accept the address. >< do you know how fustrating that can be to a person? UH! My goodness. I'm gonna go write some stories now, and post them. Maybe i'll get some reviews =D, maybe my ego will boost. Who knows?

      I was surfing around the web and I found this really nice quote:   "We call that person who has lost his father, an orphan; and a widower that man who has lost his wife. But that man who has known the immense unhappiness of losing a friend, by what name do we call him? Here every language is silent and holds its peace in impotence."  - Joseph Roux   I don't know, the quote actually took me by surprise, cause its actually very true. I'm thinking that its very true and it got me thinking. What DO you call someone who has lost a friend. This gives me a wonderful story idea, a fanfic even. I'm fully prepared for a horrible, horrible day. I'm also preparing for a move to my room. i/e, the internet shall soon be in my room and I can play all the mmorpgs I want. *cheers happily* :D. I'm thinking of heading to Full Sail in orlando. Maybe I might finally be able to go to a con and stuff. I might even get a roommate who likes anime.   We might become good friends!!! :) Ahhhh, the blissful melancoly of dreams. I love the 90s is tonight at like 9. I also have a new sunday addiction, 4400 from 9 to 11 at night  I'm also waiting for Lost and Desperate Housewives. I really can't wait for fall. Its going to be off the hook 4 sure!!  edit: Another quote!!!   "Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real." - Tupac Shakur      (did I mention not only do I love kanye but tupac as well? *grins* :D)

      my god, this woman pisses me off sometimes. Its not a night unless i am pissed beyond repair with my fucking family. Screw them is all I have to say. X-( I've also come to a realization, I won't survive this damn summer. I'm likely to bang my head into a wall or suffer a mental breakdown. I'm pissed to the point of tears, she never gives me a break.  She sometimes gets me thinking if i'm loaning this body from her and if i don't follow her rules I will damage her goods. She never treated my sisters this way, and their hair looked worse than mines does today. She's just being hard on me cause i'm the youngest and the one most likely to leave home after college with absolutely no money. (And its exactly what I plan to do)  Peace and not so much love <3

      You know, the only reason I post basically once a day is cause its summer, and I'm bored. So bored that I am writing everyday in my blog. When school starts come mid-august, I guarndamntee that I shall not be posting as much. I will end up tired and stressed and hating teachers all over again with my "undoubtly" luck, I'll get the worse. Currently I'm watching 1 life 2 live. Its hillarious. Gotta love when the blonds get into a cat fight. and then this HUGE, HUGE mob story.

      Goood news! I finally get the end of the kayne west video (jesus walks, church version) The three of them give up their sins that got them into so much trouble. The drunkplaced his bottle on the floor of the church, symbolizing that he gives up drinking, the criminal places his bandana down symbolizing that he gives up crime and the prostitue throws herself on the floor, symbolizing that she's gonna stop, well prostituning. Yay I'm so proud! I use to be so curios as to why the chick kept falling on the floor. and yes, Kayne West is my favorite rapper XD

Sheesh, calm your nerves. and my GOD these people. I need to get out of this house before I am tempted to commit suicide just so they can leave me alone! Its fustrating and heartbreaking. I just need a vaction from them. Especially from my nephew. He gets everything he wants and ignores everything I say as if I'm their fucking maid and I'm below him! Damn house, damn people!!! What did I do in my past life worthy of this hell? HUH? Someone tell me please!! (Not really that was a retorical question) I'm gonna go watch one life to live and all my children.

      (Just so you know, charley completely avoided us, and we were all prepared too. My heart goes out to the families who weren't prepared and who lost their hopes, dreams, and families to Charley. 8 people all together were killed. And now on to the regualarly scheduled rant:)  *Bangs her head against a wall*  I need to leave this house, I need to leave hell hole for bigger, better and probably brighter (or crappier) days. You know its bad when I'm anticiapating being out of this house on a daily bases, FOR SCHOOL!!! That's just...just... wow. My mom is all in a hiffy mad and completely obnoxious because I am a teenager. Yes, I have commited the all to horrible sin of having an OPINION. I am embrassed and angry. She always, always has to put her two cents in. This is what I get for leaving my room on days she's off. It my own fault for having an individual mind.  I still think i'm loaning this body from her cause she always has to tell me something about it. I feel like a little kid who can't take care of herself and needs her mother to hold her hand every step of the bloody way. She wants a kid to baby and choose shit for, well, ma, my nephews right there waiting to be babied and waiting to leave me the hell alone.  I wanna get out of here, just go someplace calm, quiet and serene. I know orlando ain't the perfect place to do that but hey, I want tranquility dammit. *Closes eyes and repeats mantra* I am going to go insane, I am going to go insane, I am GOING to go insane...Peace, Calm, Tranquil insanity...

      The last Friday of the summer. How sad. I'm gonna CRY!!! Oh, I'm sure by now you have all heard about charley. My family has a joke that its really Irene from a few years back coming back to woop our asses. But, this time Miami will roughly get the backlash of it. Or probably a tail.  Or if its really supernatural, it'll change course and run us over. Then it'll stop curve around Florida and hit us ALL over again.  I fell sorry, for the people on the west coast. Charley was upgraded to a four from a three. I believe Andrew from when I was five was a four.... Or was it a six? I don't know all I know is that it was scary as FUUUUDDDGGGGEEE, afterwards of course! I remember it. We were hiding in the closet and I slept completely through it. Only when the eye came I had to piss so my dad lead me to the bathroom. But it was all quiet and scary and dark. Really really dark.  Afterwards there was debris all over the place. And it just looked like something from a scary movie. The only cool thing to come out of it was that I got my first pet bird, which was a crow that had a broken wing. We named him...Come to think of it...His name was Furgee....  I was heartbroken when we let him go back out into the wild.  I loved Furgee so much. I think sometimes when I'm doing dishes, Furgee sits on the fence and watches me.... how sweet. Of course, all those damn crows look the same *shrugs*  That gives me an idea for a very interesting story. (Heheheehehe)   edit: Charley IS begining to woop our asses with backlashes from its tail. I'm guessing its gonna be raining all night tonight =D

      I had a really freaky nightmare last night. I dreamt that, well I went back to school. I got lost and the teacher was annoying and...and...UH!!! I don't wanna go back to school. I DONT wanna  go back to those damn crowds. My god. Day in day out crowds, crowd after crowd. And people are so incon fucking ceterate.  They stand in the MIDDLE THE FUCKING MIDDLE of the damn hallways and chatter. Chatter chatter chatter! And its usually a huge group too.  Then if its a small group, its always in front of the staircase of the doorways. Its SOOO annoying. And when the late bell rings, everybody then rushes to get to class. Do you know what its like to be short in a stampede of people who still chatter on the way to class?  In othernews, my nephew is getting more annoying each day. I'm actually starting to look forward to the crowds. AND going around the entire school to find the least crowded area. Usually that means going outside, and sadly, outside is hot. Always hot. Like I was saying, my nephew keeps acting so annoying. >  You don't know how good I feel when he finally goes down for a nap. ;D

       I haven't posted in a while... That's really not like me. I'm used to posting everyday, but stress has reared its ugly head. School is starting soon, so I need to make up my back to school lists and stuff and sign away my free days. I don't get it. I don't wanna go back to school, but I don't wanna stay here. I wanna go! GO! You know? And get out of here. Out of this god damned hell hole.  In other news, my nephews birthday party was yesterday. I didn't have that much fun. It was sort of boring to me. And my nephew pissed me off before the party, so that was also kind of bad to me. And my head hurt. I had so many excuses and so little time. I need to go read some yaoi and calm my haggard nerves.
