      home now,  away from the war  away from the violence,  away from the gore   back to your home town,  out of Hell  there is a church  ringing its bell   people all around,  asking what it was like  they couldn't under stand  any of this fight   they sit at home  watching their set  while others fighting for freedom  get shot in the chest   i walk to my home now,  a boy tugs at my shirt  then he asks me,  "did you ever get hurt   i said it's hard to understand  the pain that i feel  i bend over,  then come to a kneel   i ask for his name,  he says, "Jonny White"  then it hits me,  his dad died in this fight   we fought together,  across the sea  i know that bullet  was intended for me   i say to the boy  "your father was a good man"  then we walk away,  hand in hand

      Here I am at my bedside  Having visions, of suicide  I am sick of this contemplation  All my thoughts just lead to frustration  &nbsp;  All the hate is getting bigger  I know now that I will pull the trigger  With this death no one will suffer  This epidemic is getting tougher  &nbsp;  I have been accused of rape  This is the only way I can escape  This is the ultimate price to pay  But I’m glad not to see another day  &nbsp;  It wasn’t even and accident  Because I am innocent  They think they are after the right guy  And for that I have to die

      The pain is getting stronger  Darkness now o’re my eyes  They do not see my struggle  They do not hear my cries  &nbsp;  I have lost all control and  I have a new addiction  I don’t know if I can take it  With all this self infliction  &nbsp;  I feel the hatred raising  I’m getting madder now  You think you know what its like  Blood dripping from your brow  &nbsp;  It hurts so very badly  Oh shit I cut too deep  I am here all alone and  Life’s hill is getting steep  &nbsp;  There are no people by me  No lights flashing around  I’m going to die lonely  I think as I hit the ground
