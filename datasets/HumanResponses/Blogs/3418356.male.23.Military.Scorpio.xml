      Well, it's late. I should be getting to bed soon. Got a little studying to do before work tomorrow. Should have done more this weekend, but as usual... Got distracted. Got too much stuff here. Can't realy get any work done. Keep bouncing between things. Got a big test comming up pretty soon. I know I'll pass, but since is the second time I've taken it, everyone is pressuring me to do exceptionally well. Like ace it or something. I don't care about that. I just wanna pass and get it out of the way. It doesn't count against me if I pass by 1 point or ace it. In a few weeks, they'll forget all about it. Stupid test anyway. I know how to do my job. I'm a damn good worker. I put a lot of hard work into what I do. I suffer, and bleed for them. And get no recognition. Then they ask me to prove that I know what I'm doing, by giving me a test over material I don't even use. What the hell! Yeah, some of it is basic material I should know, but I don't use. And some of it is material that I don't need to know, and don't use, and won't be using in the near future. Bunch of bull shit. Give me a wrench, and let me get back to work. Everything fine and dandy as long as I do my job, and the planes fly (I fix planes). But when I can't pass a stupid test, they're ready to string me up and kick me out. Yes, I'm a little angry. I'm upset. But lets move on...  Saw Matrix: Revolutions tonight, yeah I know. I'm a little behind everyone. Got it on widescreen DVD a while back, and just now got around to viewing it. I know theres some complaints that it isn't a good movie, but I enjoyed it. Over all I enjoyed the Matix trilogy. Each one is a good movie. And I really like Sci-Fi, so I liked them. Yes, they present deep, philosophical debates in each one, and I enjoyed that too. Yeah, I think the third one was lacking something... but it was still a good movie. Good special effects. I mean, the guys set out to do live action anime, and in that I think they succeded. Eh, what do you think? Love it, hate it?

      Wow, what a title. I guess most people would start their post off with a description of themselves... maybe a little background or something. I don't think I'll do that. If I keep this up, you'll learn all about me eventually.  Well, It's late. I'm bored, and sitting at my computer. I just cooked dinner, which is a rare thing for me. It's not that I can't cook (given directions I can do anything), I just don't have occasion to cook much. But I was chatting with a friend, and she said she was making hamburger helper, so I decided to make something. After rootin' through my empty cupboards, I settled on chicken flavored Rica-A-Roni, bisquets (sp?), and a bottle of White Zinfandel. I put a little cheese on the rice. Very good. The bis... rolls have bee in my fridge for a while.. and the White Zinfandel is about the only wine that doesn't make me gag. Ironic really... my family owns a vineyard, and I don't like the taste of wine. :-)  Well, we'll see how this thing goes. And if anybody's interested in hearing my thought.

      Well, here I am in Germany. A nice three-month vacation really. I got sent here a few weeks ago, thats why I haven't posted in a while. I've been off-base once, and saw some nice country side. But I went to another base, so I didn't see much of the local culture. Still, I'm planning to. Maybe after payday. I hear theres a winefest comming up soon. Gotta look into that. I'm trying to learn german. Picking up a little bit everyday. But I don't really have anybody to practice with. Thinking I should get a pen pal or something. Anyway. I'm on my lunch break, so I gotta get going. Hopefully I'll post more. We'll see. TTFN.

      Well, my big test is tomorrow... tuesday. It's almost 2am and I'm still up. The test isn't till 1pm so I've got some time. Haven't looked at my book in a week. Hope I remember most of it. Just enough to pass really. I don't really care about getting a hundred. Just wanna pass, so I can move onto the next volume and get all these people at work off my back. Oh, well. We'll see how it goes.  Been spending a lot of time playing Neverwinter Nights (NWN). Been scripting a lot too. I enjoy computer games, especially games that I can get into and make new things for. Right now I'm working on a casino for a friends server. He's on leave right now, but the guy he left in charge requested some games. So I'm putting something together. It's turning out so well, that I might release it as it's own mod. Or maybe just host it myself. Dunno. We'll see. I gotta get a web page for my NWN projects... haven't done a webpage in a while. Haf'ta try that some time when I get done with my CDC's.  My brother should be in town tomorrow. Or maybe the day after. Dunno when he's gonna show. He's bringing his truck up, and I'm gonna buy it. Runs well, gets good gas milage, and it has a descent CD player. Thinking about getting one of those spray-in liners put in. Gotta get my own insurance though. And I should probably get my license renewed. Still got the same one I had when I turned 16. Oh well. Well, I'm outta things to say. TTFN.
