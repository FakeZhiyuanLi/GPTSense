      I had a fun day today. Hung out with my bro, burned off 3 new CD's (Yeah Yeah Yeah's-EP, Yeah Yeah Yeah's-Fever to Tell, Blink 182-self-titled), so it wasn't all that bad. Then I went with Joel to the rec, out to eat, and to Secret Window, one frickin awesome movie. I love it! The only bad thing about my day...my mom got a new car. I should be excited and all, but she got a new car, and had to trade in our old one. So now we are back to having one car. I'm without. And since she got this new one, there's like no way I will be able to get one now. My 16th summer, where I will have a job, and yet I won't have a car. I guess I will have to save up and get a POS. Wonderful.

      I have barely moved at all today. After I got home from my perm (and getting my application filled out and everything for Cody Park concessions!), I got on my computer. I got up to pick up some pop from my grandma. And then I got back on my computer. I live such an amazing life, I don't know how I keep up with everything.  I was supposed to go with Joel today out to the interstate lake, but then something came up so we couldn't. I'm disappointed, but oh well, life goes on. I just wish I hadn't basically bribed my mom into letting me go, and cleaned my entire room just so I could go, if I ended up not being able to.   So, today sorta sucked. I don't like my hair much. She said the curl should relax, and it better, or heads are going to roll.

      On the first day I get to sleep in in a LONG time, my mom walks into my room and yells in my ear, "Do I have all of your laundry!?!?!??!?!" Jeeze louise! This just sucks ass now, I have an hour till my mom gets home to take me to my appointment, so I'm just hanging out until the hell comes. I won't stop moving today.   It wasn't really a fight, but Joel and I sorta got upset with each other last night. I'm just totally running out of patience. THAT'S why I needed to sleep in. But no, now I have to give my friends a whole week more of Jordan's Bitch Syrup. It's GRRRRRRReat!

      Just got home from musical practice and Beach wants us to go in tomorrow at 12 for rehearsal...12!!! No way dude! On our day with NO SCHOOL and he's going to make us come in for 3 frickin' hours! DAMN YOU BEACH, DAMN YOU! Just messin, he's a cool guy, just he is twisted in some ways.  Now I am home alone. Mom is taking Jared to Dad's right now, so I'm at home, just chillin' like a villian. Talkin on the 'puter. Fun, fun.   My weekend plans...          1)Friday:                a)10:00 ---> Hair cut               b)12:00 ---> Rehearsal               c)3:30ish ---> Movie, possibly          2)Saturday:               a)All Day ---> Hangin at home               b)Night time ---> Hangin with Joel          3)Sunday:               a)4:45 ---> Feeding the homeless (I'm not kidding, I really am)  Now that everyone knows, well, yeah.

      Wow, well, I'm at school right now. Big whoop! Just got done delivering papers, and now, I'm bored stiff. We went over to Madison and it actually looks newer than Adams. Huebby yelled at me once again! It's starting to upset me! He keeps getting in the way of my social aspects! I'm not grounded anymore...or so I think. It all depends on the way my closet looks (mom speaking).  Whatever that's supposed to mean. Because of all those squats I did on Tuesday, when I walked into Confirmation last night, it looked like I was drunk. Funny stuff. I'll tell ya more when I get home. Chao!

      Another fun-filled day of school in the life of Jordan. Whoop, whoop! P.S., if you didn't notice, I like to space things out. I hope you don't mind.  43 days...the countdown commences...  What fun, I have a fitness test tomorrow. Great, great.   Huebby actually told everyone to settle down today...twice! Holy cow, I hope he doesn't strain himself. Took a standard test. One question was something like: If you have an aquarium that is 32.4 feet in diameter, and 12 feet tall, how many gallons of water could fill it? I wanted to answer it by saying, "just stick in a hose and turn it off when full." I didn't think that would go over well, so I stopped being a smartass and wrote down 8 potatoes instead. And only after I turned it in, did I realize it was going to be graded.  And what do you know, Beach didn't even notice I wasn't at practice last night. Yahoo! Another plus; the corn is done! Today I got my very own rad hammer to help put together a fence. Awesome.   The Bulldogger comes out on Thursday and that will be my last issue for the year. Tear, tear. I truly love that thing. So much fun. I will never forget that class! And I hopefully will be made editor when I'm a senior. I hope.  Now I get to go head out to a frosh/jv choir and band concert, I cannot wait. I get to sit in the back w/Joel and make fun of all the freshies banging their heads and playing air guitar. AWESOME!   Tomorrow is St. Pattys day, and the only shirt I have that is green, I wore last Friday. I'm screwed. I do have green chonies, and green socks, but that doesn't count. I guess I'll have to wear some green pants or something. What a queer am I? I don't have a green shirt, but I do have green pants. Go figure. Enough of my wardrobe.  Well, now I'm just sitting here, jamming out to some NIN. Ya know, one really good book is Hard Love by Ellen Wittlinger. It sounds stupid, but it rocks. Its about this dude who falls in love with a lesbian.   I think I'm going to start writing a zine. I'll let ya'll know when I'm done.  And I'm spent!

       Note: These times are NOT correct, date is, time isn't. It's gay and I can't figure out how to make it work!   Well, now that I have a blog, I don't know what to write about. Isn't that peachy? Today was alright I guess...I'm not depressed anymore, so that's a plus. I got told by Huebby today to pay attention! Wow, I'm proud of that guy, he finally found his balls.   Lunch was hilarious today, Sarah had Kent say "scrotum" just so that she would vote for him. It was great. Tomorrow we will be having "penis" yelling contests, and you could be a winner! Or should I say, weiner? Mwahahahaha!   Alright, enough of my perversion. Beach is going to freak tomorrow because I've skipped practice twice. Oh well, I didn't audition for the musical just to make freaky-deaky "corn" (in reality, its wheat with bright green tissue paper taked to it with electrical tape. What a budget we have.)  We had pizza for dinner. Two slices of supreme pizza and some Dominos dots. Yummy scrumbos.  I also just went over to my grandma's house to see my uncle before he leaves back for Tex-ass. He gave me a cool pocket knife to protect myself from the flocking males. Yeah, right. But I did get to see an entire episode of Fear Factor. Interesting...I will never eat a snail. Poor little guys.  And now I'm just sitting here, waiting until school tomorrow so I can start this boring cycle  allllllllll  over again. How much fun is that? Man, I need to take up a hobbie.

      If you haven't guessed it already, the titles of my entries are all the last lyrics I have heard. Cool huh? I know, I'm a queer. :D  Welllllllll I'm bored. Waiting for 6:30 to roll around...hum diddly dum. I'm goin to go chill w/Joely for awhile. La la la la la! Oh yeah, yesterday Joel got me a new belly ring! Yay! It's so purdy! It's a moon with a little diamond star, it's really cute.   Today it is raining.

      Hey, sorry that I've neglected this for the past few days. It's not like I haven't had time...I just haven't written. Nice of me, huh? Well, anyhoo, on Monday I took Joely out for pie since it was his bday. We had fun, and now he can drive and it's awesome! On Tuesday I had a concert, and it was so much fun! Not, but what the hey. Then today I went to school and came home. GeeGee gave me a chocolate easter egg. It was yummy. And that was the highlight of my day. Tomorrow Joel is taking me somewhere after school to buy me something and I don't know what it is...

      Well, I just got back from a drive in our new Bonneville. It's nice. Heated seats. CD Player. Sunroof. And I guess it's not too bad. Mom said she's going to find a rust bucket for me to drive, Uncle Jon said one of his friends has a $600 caddy he's trying to sell, so we are looking at that right now. Things could be worse. At 4:45 I get to go feed the homeless for 3 hours. Big whoop. It's not bad, I need to do some community service, I'm just too lazy to do it. GRR! Tomorrow is Joely's birthday! Yay! We get to go cruise around and eat pie! Yum! And we can go make a mess for Hergie to clean up. God, I hate that kid.

      The following is a letter I wrote to my Joely!:   Hey Joely, sorry I wasn't online sooner, my mom made me take a nap, and lemme tell ya, it sounded quite nice. So I just thought I'd write you back to say "Hello!"   And I have to go to confirmation....boooooooooo. It sucks so bad. He acts like the St. Pats kids are so much better than the public school kids, it pisses me off. They know more about the bible, sure, but how about music! Boo-yah, bihatch! Just messin, had to get that out before I went. So now I will write you an e-mail until I leave.   I am very nervous for tryouts. I think I will get the routine down soon, I know the first part, I just need to piece it all together. I don't think I will make it, but I will try my hardest anyway! I just have a request though, if I don't make it, please don't say your sorry or anything. Just pat me on the shoulder or something. I just don't want to be told that people are feeling sorry for me.     I just thought i'd put that in my weblog so ya'll know what I've been doin. Not like anyone reads this, but what the hey! Go to www.geocities.com/queen_orda06 to tell me if you are reading this! Well, that's my life! Gotta go to confirmation...peace out homies. HA!

      Sorry I haven't written for a long time. I've been busy with all of this musical and cheerleading try-outs. Well, the musical is over now, and I didn't make cheerleading, so now I'm back to ol' borin' Jordan! Yippee!   I'm not mad about not making cheerleading or anything...I'm actually relieved. I didn't want to make it, truthfully.     And now it is Good Friday and I'm at home on my computer, not eating meat. Fun, fun.  Morp was last night. I had fun. The dj blew, but it's okay.  Guess what...I GOT A CAR!!! An '87 Dodge Shadow, GG's old one. Doesn't that truly kick some major booty???   Well yeah, I don't have much else to write about. I'm going to go work on my zine. Lata!  P.S. I finished Hard Love, and now I'm moving onto Born Blue. I've read them both before, but they rock.

      Hello, I'm bored. Yes I am. Watching Room Raiders, and just hangin out. Wow, I really am bored. I just realized how much I am bored. In a row, I've watched WildBoyz, Jackass, i Want A Famous Face, Room Raiders, and Room Raiders. Now I'm probably going to watch another episode of Room Raiders. Wow.  But yeah, I'm bored. Not that I haven't told you already. I have only changed out of my pajamas once in the past three days. Sick, huh? Oh well, I'm comfy.  Oh it's not Room Raiders, it's Advance Warning. Whatever the fuck that is.

      Wow, today was districts. And I am pooped. I didn't think a bus ride could make you so tired, but hey, it sure did. I think this is one of the first times I've slept on the bus ride both there and back. I have no life or something. We got a II at districts. Oh well, we could've done worse. Now I just want to go to bed.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! WHEN WILL THIS COME!?!?!?!?!? Please God, please, please, please, come soon. I need it more than ever. Please.

      Wow, I'm bored. Another three day weekend, and Jordan's at home. On Saturday it's music districts in Kearney, yay! Except we'll be there with the frickin' Bearcats....what the hell is a Bearcat anyway? Some sort of an animal rape gone wrong without emergency contraception?  At lunch today, I stole Kyle's Reeses. I thought he saw me do it, but I tell ya what, that boy can be blind sometimes. Or maybe it's with all males. They seem to only hear what they want to hear. You can say something extremely important, and they won't hear you unless whatever you say contains the words "boobs," "football," or "he was so big." Then again, when you're screaming it helps too. Now, I'm not saying this goes for the entire male species, I'm just saying...some are pretty dense.  As well as females too though. They listen TOO much! It's like you say "I want a fishing tank" and they are like "Did you just call me a dirty skank???" My Lord! But whatever, I don't care much for either species.  I'm not saying that I'm A-sexual or anything, I mean, my god, I do have a boyfriend. But it just amazes me how blonde the human race can be. I'll check in later when I'm bored again...

      I must say, my birthday rocked yesterday. I got like 85 bucks, and bought my seat covers. Mom got me a stereo for my birthday and it rocks too. Then she took me and GG to Golden Dragon for lunch, and then that night we went to Whiskey Creek to eat some BBQ. It was a great birthday. Sarah came over and I took her for a spin in my new "pimp-mobile." Well, bell is gonna ring, so I gotta boogie, I'll try to check in later.

      Huebby really gets on my nerves. Today, I accidentally smacked Sarah's desk with my shoes, and Sarah starts to laugh.  Huebby then askes Sarah the answer to whatever question he just asked, and she said that she didn't hear the question, and if he'd repeat it. He just looks at her and says "I don't repeat questions."  Yet, just a few minutes before that, Cody falls asleep on his desk, and Huebby askes him a question, he doesn't answer of course, duh, he's catching ZZZ's, so Huebby wakes him up, and what do you know, he's a nice guy...AND REPEATS THE QUESTION.  One of the many mysteries about Mr. Huebner and his freaky-deaky Geometry class.  We started Sex Ed in Healthy Lifestyles yesterday. Quite interesting. Especially when you are put in a group of perverted guys, and have to come up with a list of physical things someone does to express their sexuality. Answers ranged from "tap that all night long" to "wet fingers."  Sometimes I really think that I was put in the wrong grade or something. I honestly can't stand half of the sophomore class, and next year it's going to be murder having my grade in Varsity choir with me. I just might go on a rage and smack some people around in there. *Not a threat, just a joke*   TB didn't wear a bra today. Wow. At lunch we were all saying, "Brrr, it's cold in here.  What color of bra are you wearing?  Wouldn't it feel weird not to wear one? "  She's either deaf, or blind, or as smart as a brick wall.  I'm leaning towards the last one though.

      I'm back in CA2, and thought I'd check in.  These past few weeks have been sort of odd. I've been happy I guess, down in the dumps a little bit, and etc.  But yeah, I'm going to write in later, I promise. Gotta go now, I don't feel comfortable writing in this while I'm in a classroom with about 30 other people.

      Guess what. I got a job. Yes-sirry-Bob, Jordan is now a working girl. 12-25 hours a week at Herberger's as a Juniors Sales Associate. Rock on.   I went to Alex's graduation on Saturday, and for Wellfleet being such a hick town, I actually had fun. We went on this wagon ride up to Wellfleet Community Lake and it was so pretty up there. But it reminded me of Wrong Turn and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so now it kinda creeps me out. Still pretty though.  I got to drive GG's Infinity back home, and that was just plain awesome. April Morgan drove with me, and we had the sunroof open, windows down, and Murphy Lee cranked all the way to the top. Tell you what, that car has got an awesome stereo system. Geegers doesn't know what she's missing.

      Hey there. I'm at my fa-sha's house right now. And for those of you that haven't seen Goldmember, I'm at my dad's house. See, my parents are divorced, and I rarely visit my dad's house because my step mom lives there, and, well, I don't like her much. But I'm sure by now everyone knows that. Well, I'm hungry, and there's a plate full of hot dogs waiting upstairs for me, but why am I not up there choking them down? Because there are two people up there that I have know idea who they are. And I'm not about to go shove grub in my face with two strangers staring at me. Leave people, leave!  Alice, Rob, and Emma are gone right now because they went to go visit Grandma and Grandpa somewhere south of McChef*. I didn't even know they were in Nebraska. Dad says they've been here a month already. I think they are probably outcasting us as well since they aren't liking my dad much at the moment.  I miss SQ* already!

      Why hello. I had to work again last night, and it wasn't too bad. I got help from this one chick, Kayla, who was really nice. I think I'll get the hang of it, I just need some time.   Only one full day left of school...yay! The last day I will have to eat at school, not saying that I won't anymore, because I most likely will, but I'm just saying, now I won't get in trouble for skipping! Yahoo! Not like I have gotten in trouble for it, I'm just sneaky. Sneaky, sneaky, sir.  I picked up my medal today from Awards Ceremony that I couldn't go to.  I'm glad they spelled my name right since they didn't on the sign. I was wondering...  I hope I have all A's this term. I should. This is as follows:  Bus Comp 2: 99% Geometry: 97% Orch/Vocal: ??? Health: 99%  I really hope I have an A in Orch/Vocal. That would just plain suck if I didn't have an A in that class and it ruined my 4.0, and my chance to be a Valedictorian.  Especially since that class is a total Mickey.   Get this...yesterday Dad called Mom, and talked to her for awhile, and guess what he actually told her. "Tell Jordan that she needs to start looking at colleges." WTF!!! Does he think that I'm a complete idiot or something? If he tells me that, I'm going to look him square in the eye and say "Okay Dad, because I'm not on about 10 college mailing lists, I don't subscribe to College and University Magazine, and I haven't taken a Pre-ACT and Pre-SAT tests this year. I so need your guidance on this."  Jeeze Louise.   I'm going to Dad's house this weekend. Alice and Rob are going to be here before they go to Iraq.  I hope they stay safe over there.  Cheesy* and Coca-Cola* are back. I'm glad. Its ridiculous they  suspended them from school for showing the tape of the guy getting his head cut off from Iraqis.  Cheesy gave the choice to watch it or not, and Coca-Cola hadn't planned to show it to the class anyway. It's a total ludicrous. If you didn't feel you were "emotionally or psychologically" ready to watch it, don't watch. Step out of the room. You were given the choice.  Stupid, stupid. I'm glad they're back though. I signed a petition to get them back.  Well, I'm done with my complaining for the day.

      Well, here I am again, at the wonderful torture zone, I like to call "School." Only 1 1/2 more days left, thank the Lord. I starte work last night and I am soooooo confused. All of these buttons and scanners and beeping, and argh. Too much for my poor little brain to handle. Oh well. I should learn fast. I hope.  Callie made me a shirt that says "Forker" on the back. Can you say wow?

      We went to the lake on Friday.  On Friday night, after my mom got off work, she picked us up with all of our stuff and we headed on the road for "the lake." We first stopped at Burger King so that we didn't starve though of course. I got a grilled chicken sandwich, and I must say, yummy. It sure did hit the spot. So, after about an hour of a drive, we end up at the lake.   Since we now have our Bonneville, it can't handle the sand, so we had to park on top of a hill and wait for Kerry to come get us in the truck.  After getting down to the camper, and unloading all of our stuff into the tent (kids get the tent, adults get the camper. Go figure.), we go on a boat ride. You have to wade out waist deep to get to the boat, and when the water temp. has to be about 55 degrees, it doesn't make you a happy camper. Especially when you are wearing denim shorts.  Anyhoo, we go for a short ride, then decide to head back. We get back, and put on our pants and sweatshirts.   There was this HUGE swarm of mosquitos outside of the camper, and you could hear them buzzing from the boat, that's how big of a swarm it was.  After throwing sand at them, which by the way didn't work, we get desperate and start taking out lighters. Now that was just fun. I can't tell you the joy I go just from hearing the little "BBZZZT" as the flame hit those little blood-suckers.  Then Brook & Jenna showed up, which was awesome, gotta hang with them for a little while.   Then I decided to hit the sack, and Joel and Jared decide to at the exact same time. I can't get to sleep because Joel is finding it hilarious to flicker the lights and sing the Twilight Zone theme song.  But sleep finally finds me. And with that, I then wake up in the middle of the night feeling pressure on my feet. Come to find out, Jared has totally flipped and has his head on my feet. I make him come get back in the right position, and he's whining because it's cold.  Well, I wonder why, when you have totally unzipped your sleeping bag, and you're laying on the cold sand!!! But I fix his sleeping bag, and the wind picks up. He's sitting there saying "I wanna go in the camper, I wanna go in the camper, I wanna go in the camper." So, as the good big sister, I respond "Do you want me to take you in the camper?" and he says "No." Well, can't say I didn't try. He finally falls asleep after I have to pat his back for about the past hour.  Sleep finds me once again.  Next morning, I wake up at the butt crack of dawn, look over at Jared and realize that I zipped his sleeping bag up inside out. He didn't seem to mind though.  I then go into the camper to find my mom cleaning the kitchen. Don't ask me why, my mother has OCD, it's a passtime for her. I'm not kidding, she really does have it, and it really is a passtime.  Anyway, I choke down a cake donut fast, and then we head up to the Lodge to fill the water bottles and get some sunflower seeds.  We go back down to the camper and find Kerry starting to cook breakfast. Breakfast burritos are oohhhhhhhhhhh so good.   Then we just to the normal routine of the lake. Eat breakfast, get cleaned up, sit outside catching some sun, listening to my mp3 player, do a couple word searches, and just wait for B&J to get up. After a little while, (it's now 2 pm), we go for a boat ride. We cruise around, and drift for awhile, increasing my sunburn. We then go pick up my other cousins that show up, and again cruise around and drift.  '  At about 4, it's starting to get really dark in the west, and the wind starts blowing, etc. We head back, and I go into Brook & Jenna's camper, and April (other cuz) goes with me. It's just us girls in there, when the wind starts to blow really hard and then it starts to rain and hail. We wait for awhile then just go back from camper to camper, playing poker. It's about 6:30, my other cousins have left since they live in the town right outside of the lake.  They invited us back to their house since the storm is so bad and hasn't let up, and doesn't look like its going to. Joel goes to inspect the tent, and finds it soaked, along with our clothes, covered in sand. We decide to haul all of our stuff into the camper, so we can take it up to the car, because we figure if the tent is soaked, it's best we just go home. So we take all the stuff out, and then guess what happens next.  Our tent starts blowing away.  Kerry sits there and says, "well, you better go catch it." That did not put him on my good side. So, it'd raining, and windy as all hell, and we are outside, chasing down our tent and taking it down at the same time. We throw it in the back of the truck, and throw all of our crap on it to keep it from blowing away.  Kerry takes us up to the Bonneville, where we load up our stuff and head in to Lisa's (my aunt, the one that lives nearby).    We get there and she's making us some food, so I head downstairs to hang with my cousin's, who have just started a movie, which I must say, was very very good (and the movie was Honey, I know it bombed, but I liked it!) .  We get to eat then, and that stuff was so good. I can't remember what it was called, let alone how to pronounce it, but it was sooo good. It was these curly noodles in marinara sause, with peperoni and sausage, and covered in cheese. Soooo yummy. With garlic bread and Coke. So, so good. And then we had brownies and ice cream for dessert. I was in heaven.  Gotta watch the rest of the movie, and part of an episode of The Inferno.  We played a few games, before we had to leave. We left at about 10:15 or so, and then Joel starts feeling sick. But he didn't ralph, which was a good thing.  We get home, and clean up all the crap from the car, take a shower, and I'm in bed by 12:30.   And now I'm just hanging out at home, cleaned out my car already today, and now I'm tired of typing. This has got to be my biggest entry ever. It's not like anyone even reads this, but if someone does, this will keep them busy.

      I just got up and decided to surf the web for awhile. I came across this girl I know's weblog. I had no idea she was so depressed. I feel bad. I like her, I think she's cool and all, a little on the odd side, but in a good way. Maybe I should talk to her . . .? Or would I sound like a douche?

      I cannot believe she said that. I just can't. My grandma is so sick. I'm scared for her. I love my grandma so much, and I couldn't imagine life without her. How could she say that to her? How? I no longer have respect for my aunt. I can't believe she could say something so hurtful. I want to cry because of it. If something happens to my grandma, I will never forgive her. How could she? Really.     How could she???

      Dude, I kinda like Maria Mena. I like her style. Is that weird? Yeah but so am I. Well, summer has been treating me descent, been hanging out with Joel and Sarah and Kyle a lot, which is cool. Been working as well, makin' some moolah, of which I have spent all of my last pay check on Saturday. Yeah, I'm embarrassed. But oh well, I'm going to start saving up for college money, more ear piercings, and XM radio. Not in that order though.  I took a test today and it said that I'm 52% bitch. What do you think?

        Apathy, well I can say your lucky, in some ways. You see Apathy is no emotion, basically you don't care. But that does not make you a bad person. Some of my friends are apathetic and I love them, but it wouldn't hurt to care a little more. Trust me life hurts, most people who are apathetic do it cause they were hurt. But don't worry, life is pain, its also pleasure. Good luck. (please vote)    urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      In 48 hours I will be hangin' out with Jess and Nikki in Denver. Sweeeeeet.  In 120 hours, I will be screaming my guts out along with Thursday. And Taking Back Sunday. And Story of the Year. And Alkaline Trio. And Coheed and Cambria. And the Vandals. And Yellowcard. And Flogging Molly.   And also in 120 hours, I will be suffering through New Found Glory. And Bowling for Soup.  All-in-all...it's so totally worth it.

      At Warped, the most awesome concert was definitly Story of the Year. When they played Anthem of Our Dying Day, it was amazing. Every person in the crowd was singing at the top of their lungs with their eyes shut, just listening to the music. It was amazing. I'm going to remember that for the rest of my life.

      Oh my Gaw. Warped tour rocked. It was utterly amazing. I'll have to go into detail on it later.  But right now. You know what. When I grow up, I'm going to own a money tree in my backyard.

      Yes, I know I'm a dork, but I also like classical. I bought 2 new cd's while I was depressed last week, and they are "Quiet Moods" and "Piano Classics." There is this one song on this CD that gets me depressed every time I put it in. It's Kyrie Eleision from Mass in E Minor by Anton Bruckner. So, so sad.  On Monday I started jobshadowing. It was pretty awesome. I loved Dermatology. Anesthesiology was alright, pretty gory though. And Human Resources was....well....not fun. Boring. Very boring. Tomorrow I do pharmacy! YAY!!!!!!!

      I'm really starting to get frustrated. Sometimes I just wish Bob would realize that I'm not happy.
