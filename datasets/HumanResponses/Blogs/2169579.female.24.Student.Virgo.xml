      there is so much that i am guilty of.  i am hypocritical when it comes to my believes verses my action, i have a hard time getting close to people, i am a perfectionist to the point of being neurotic, and i may be slightly obsessive compulsive.  but there's also alot that i am that's good.  i am open minded, i truely care about my friends, i really want to make a difference in a good way.  it would be nice to be judged by my sins rather than other people's, for a change.  but i guess that's another fault of mine, i always expect the best of others.  that's okay.  'cause those who stay my friends for a long time are those that are 'real'.  they say what they mean for better or worse, they are willing to be there through the good and the bad.  those are the only people that i want around.  i have some really good friends right now, and to all them i say 'thank you'.  u make each day a little easier.  luv u all lots...

           you ask me to love you, or at least to claim to love you but i know you love me not, unless foolishly       i ask for friendship, to feel you near - alas, all i have is an imaginary friend i don't know what you want for tomorrow or how you feel when you       lay your head down you can not tell me what makes me cry silent tears or what makes me      laugh endlessly...       it's sad, but you're not alone. so few have seen my heart, have seen my trueness. i can't let people in, because of the one's that are untrue! it is too frightening to risk my soul, only to cry alone at night...       you may as well walk away now, after all of those words with no meaning      behind them, i've mixed the morter for the wall that will hold you back.       once i cried tears for you in moments of frustration, i cursed your name and      your empty words.       now you will live in my memory more fully then you ever lived in my life! there you can hold my hand and hear my words, as my friend... there you shall stay, never again being allowed into my life...

      ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....i'm so sick of screwing up...screwing up school..screwing up relationships...screwing up my own damn head...i can't go down this same road of self distruction anymore.  i know i keep saying that.  i keep saying that while i make the same mistakes over and over and over...  i don't mean to overlook that which means the most.  i don't mean to hurt others who have done nothing wrong but try to get close to me...then again, u look at some of the things that others do to me and it makes me wonder why i keep trying at all.  i think some people have a very loose definition of the word "friend".  to me a friend doesn't blow things way out of porportion and lie about what happened just to martyr themselves as a 'bigger person'.  that's what a 6th grader does.  friends don't say one thing and do the other.  they also don't use u for their amusement and leave u outside in the cold, crying by urself.  i wonder if i shouldn't give up on people as a whole and make it my goal to live a solitary life.  it would be hard at first, but at least the only one i could be hurt by would be myself.  and i can numb that w/ alcohol and other things.  k, that's all i got for now...lots of luv

      u know how these days go.  ur cold, a little tired and unexplainably sad.  what u really want is for someone to wrap their arms around u and tell u that they love u.  u want their warmth, their touch and their heart.  so u curl up in a warm bed with a romance story that makes u happy and unbearably sad.  and wait for these feelings of longing to pass and let u get back to ur life...

      what is a women to do when she has an addiction so strong that it knaws at her every moment, sleeping and awake?  when this women understands that an addiction is nothing more than obsessions driving her to compulsions, but she can't complete her compulsion... it's not something she can smoke, drink or do.  she can touch it, but never feel it, she can hold it, but not contain it...  she is forced to write her feelings and deepest secrets in code so that no figures it out, most of what she writes is so ambigious that two different people reading about her would not draw the same conclusion.  what is this women to do?  should she throw all caution to the wind and play double or nothing?  or should she hold what little manifestations of her compulsions that she can get so close that they keep her warm at night?  it's like seeing the most beautiful sunrise, on a post card and knowing that u'll never get to see it in person, or like hearing someone talk with unbridled joy, knowing u'll never have that feeling again 'cause u know ur compulsion is slipping further and further away...  knowing that what u want with every drop of blood in ur body is too far away.  being forced to cry at night, just wishing and hoping that the earth would stop spinning and the sky would fall, for then, and only then, will this women get what she longs so desprately for.  of course when her obsession is with her, there and touchable, she is moved to tears, for having it there and knowing it won't last is almost as painful as never reaching the compulsion at all...

      sometimes i don't post anything for a while 'cause i don't know how to say what i'm feeling, or i'm not sure if i should write it where anyone can read it.  it can be scary to bare my soul and worry about who has seen it and how they feel about it...  i'm just confused, if i continue to feel how i'm feeling i may go crazy, but i can't help it.  i won't say it 'cause what if it fucks everything up?  i won't ask for what i really want, 'cause i doubt i'll get it...  i don't think people understand how hard this is for me, or how new it is to me.  i also don't think i should have to try so hard all of the time.  that's why i'm adopting the policy of acting 'as if'.  i'm gonna take what i can get and be glad that i have that.  i wish i could explain all of this as it is, but i don't know how well recieved it would be.  if i don't get it, how can i expect anyone else to get it?

      is it thy will thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night? dost thou desire my slumbers be broken while shadows like to thee do mock my sight? is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry, to find out shames and idle hours in me, the scope and tenure of thy jealousy? O no, thy love that keeps mine eye awake, mine own true love that doth my rest defeat, to play the watchman ever for thy sake.     - for thee which watch I, whilst thou dost wake  elsewhere,      -from me far off, with others all to near.

      When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies, That she might think me some untutored youth Unlearned in the world's false subtleties. Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, Although she knows my days are past the best, Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue; On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed. But wherefore says she not she is unjust, And wherefore say not I that I am old? O, love's best habit is in seeming trust, And age in love loves not to have years told. Therefore I lie with her, and she with me, And in our faults by lies we flattered be.   shakespeare sonnet 138

      i finally see what sort of balance i need in my life to be happy.  i don't want someone taking over my life.  i want my friends to be people that i know will be there when we both have time to enjoy each other's company.  i want my boyfriend to be someone who wants to spend some of his free time with me and someone that wants to know how my day was and will tell me about his.  i need my time to do my thang.  i need time to consentrate on skool, take care of my shit, and just chill and enjoy things.  i'm no one's mother and don't care to babysit anyone, i don't want to be someone's all.  i just wanna be me.  so who wants to party this weekend?  u game?

      No more be grieved at that which thou hast done: Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud, Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. All men make faults, and even I in this, Authorizing thy trespass with compare, Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss, Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are; For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--- Thy adverse party is thy advocate--- And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence. Such civil war is in my love and hate      That I an accessory needs must be      To that sweet thief which sourly robsf rom me.                 ---Shankespeare sonnet 35

      well my presentation for tomorrow is done, thats good.  i never knew what stress was till i came to college.  not only is school demanding, but so are people.  of course the more u put in the more u get out.  i can honestly say that everyday i get a little closer to being the person i wanna be...  i see now that that is why certain people have left my life.  those who are afraid to change themselves don't want to see other people change, those that are constantly changing don't mind seeing other's change.  they understand that while certain bits of ur personality or certain habits may change, u are still the same person, just a little bit better now.  :)  don't get me wrong, this entry isn't about dissing anyone, it's just an idea i have right now.  i also wanna say thanx to my friends...u all kick ass!!!  oh yeah baby, u know who u are....  good luck to everyone during this new week, may it be just a little better than last week (though my last week went so well....)hehehe

      i feel so disposable. am i one of those people that can be written off that easily?  well this must be take out the trash year...this year i've lost vinnie and lucy who couldn't be bothered w/me 'cause i live far away...i don't know what came between greg and i, but maybe that is for the better, even so it still stings... i have no idea what happened b/w jen and me, one day we're friends, the next i'm self-centered, whatever...and now walter...who knows.  of all those friends i've lost walter should hurt the least 'cause i knew him only briefly and we never knew that much about each other, but it still hurts...am i so un-important?  i guess so, so get out the hefty bag and toss me into the dumpster... of course the ironic thing is that i have gained alot more new friends then i've lost friends...but what is supposed to make me think these one's will last?  i doubt they will...fine so be it!  someday i'm gonna meet someone w/the same values and beliefs as me, and then i know they will stay. just like megan, robin, jan and mark have stayed.  those are true friends...they don't play these dumb games, life's not a joke to them...they are here for me thru the good and the bad, as i am there for them.  i guess i'm lucky.  who else has had friends for 17+ years?  not many people.  i'm glad i wrote this, 'cause i feel much better now.  not great, but better.  so all u fakers can just kiss my pink ass, 'cause i don't need u!!!

      what the fuck?  i just don't understand why it is that i continue to think the best of people.  i'm always let down.  is it that hard to dial a phone?  how much longer will i care.  the last two to do this were easy to move on from.  surprisingly so.  u'll be harder, but i gotta do what i gotta do.  so fuck u.  someday someone else will make me feel the way u do, i hope.  i don't think i even ever told u that.  that no one else has ever made me feel like that.  i've never blushed over a man before, i've never cared this much...and see what it gets me!  NOTHING!!!  what the fuck!?

      i'd be a liar if i said it didn't hurt my feelings.  but i've learned that feeling this way isn't horrible, i don't have to try to make it go away.  i can use it to motivate me to be a better person myself.  i won't make someone else feel this way.  but that's okay, i'm glad u had a good night, i really am happy for u.  i also sleep better knowing that u miss me too.  i know u do.  whether for the right or wrong reasons, but that's okay too.  once u had alot of importance in my life, now ur just one cog in a thousand that turn continuously.  i don't understand when things changed or why, but i do feel so much better.  it's a sort of relief.  i guess that says something doesn't it?  that it's better to let go, 'cause then u move onto the ones who really matter.  i matter first.  no jumping when someone else yells.  i don't know why i'm rambling on like this, i think i'm exhausted and still a little fucked up...yes halloween was that awsome that i'm still fucked up the next night.  well i'll wrap this up, good night and sweet dreams...

      wow, that was some friday and halloween.  on one hand, i am disappointed w/some of what i did.  but on the other, i am happy...it's 2003 and it's about time that i move beyond what is 'expected' of me by people who don't know me.  but if i'm gonna keep this up i have to do it better.  make sure there no misunderstandings.  well, i'll work on that one.  anyways, over all it was a great halloween.  i had alot of fun w/my friends.  i will always remember halloween senior year!!!!  and i won't be the only one w/fond memories of it!!!!  hehehehehe

      that last post seems so appropriate for how i'm feeling right now.  now that i have had it all i'm having problems settling for less.  i want all of those feelings back.  the warmth that would spread through me everytime i looked into his eyes.  the feel of his hands on my skin... all that and more.  will i ever have those feelings for anyone again?  if so then when?  i feel so empty right now.  so abandoned.  i keep hoping for a phone call, an email...  i understand that he wasn't right for me, so how did i fall so hard?  what happened to my kool detachment that i usually have for people?  and what now?  will someone please tell me how to make these feelings go away?  how to numb myself?  please...

      all of a sudden i feel very overwhelmed.  i have so much resting on my shoulders that i just dont' know what to do.  i know it's now that i need to suck it up and ask for help, but i want most to run untill i fall and then lay there for a while.  i'm so close.  in a matter of months i'll have my bachelors degree.  then i'm off to my masters.  all this when i never pictured getting out of this city, let alone finding success.  so now it's christmas eve and i have to pretend to care bout it.  i'll go make my familial rounds and say the right things and smile at their holiday cheer...  but my heart won't be into it and my mind wont be observing it...

      why is it that i have no say in who i fall into luv w/?  and i have no say in who it is that fills my thoughts and dreams?  when u know that the person that u are missing is bad for you, that they would cause more pain then happiness, yet they are always on your mind.  how long before i can forget?  or at least stop remembering on a regular basis...

'cause were just jokin 'bout that, u don't really got the HIV do u? (hmmm...how did that one get started).  anyways, my point is that ur secrets r safe w/me.  i won't shout u out @ sensitive things like ur sexuality or std status.  so let's chill and enjoy our last days here b/f xmas...lata girl

      i'm done.  really done w/it all.  i think i really will be selfish now.  i'm not gonna give to people who only take.  i will not become my mother.  i will not try to make things right all of the time, sometimes everythings wrong and u gotta toss out the garbage and start anew.  if ur one of those people who only wants to take from me, and give me nothing, then u the garbage i'm throwin out.  i'm not gonna pretend something didn't happen so u can save face.  listen, u blew up about a simple yes or no question. and u, i have no idea what happened w/u.  and finally, u want a convienence girlfriend.  u want someone to be there when u want her to be.  and for her to not bother u any other time.  well guess what!? i got needs too.  i need to know that i'm respected.  i have to know that u'd do for me what i'd do for u.  i need u to tell me what's on ur mind, i'm not psychic.  throw me a god-damned bone, and not the one between ur legs.  this has been a difficult semester.  i've lost one of the best friends i've ever had.  that hurt, 'specially since he can't be a man and own up to his part of things.  then i lost a friend who was relatively new.  that hurt, 'cause she obviously didn't know me at all.  then i lost the one that hurts the most.  i have the most trouble talkin 'bout this one.  i just don't get it.  but obviously he didn't know me very well either, and he never let me get to know him.  now it's time for me to move on.  i got some new friends too.  with their support and my own stregnth i'll get past all of this and end up better than all of u.

      y must life be this hard?  i'm not a complicated person, i don't play confusing games.  i want to be respected.  is that so difficult.  i'm not using fancy grammatics.  i'm asking for what i need.  and u think i'm joking?  that goes to show u how little u know me.  sometimes it's hard for me to say out loud how i feel, but my writing is always true.  once a week isn't that much.  a fucking phone call isn't brain surgery.  after u left last time i felt so empty.  that is when i realized that having just bits of u was hurting me worse than having none of u.   i don't want u to leave my life, but i can't go on like this.  i forget sometimes how disposable i am.  u won't be the first to chose to forget about me.  and u prolly won't be the last.  that doesn't make me feel any better tho.  it sorta makes it hurt worse.  'cause i thought u were different.  i remember every word u ever said to me.  and i remember all of the things u never said.  i have never lied to u.  i have never used u.  i always thought the best of u.  and look what i got in return...

      I haven't asked for the sun, the moon or the stars.  I need not diamonds and gold.  All i want is u.  ur voice, ur smile and ur affection.  Yet i stand here alone.  Alone in the morning.  Alone in the in the day.  Alone in the night.  ur are not so important as to have nothing left for me,  I know there are many minutes u could spare, if u so chose.  but i am alone.  Not by my choice, but by urs.   I ask not for power and dominance, I ask for equality.  (and u won't give me ten minutes of talk.)  Maybe by not asking for it all, i am committing myself to nothing, but i can't concern myself w/ur side anymore.  now is ur time to stand up and make a choice.  u r a man, not a boy.  u can do most anything that would please u. now u must decide which satisfies ur needs more.  me in ur life or me gone for ever.  no in betweens, no partimes, no maybes.

      i just realized that five relationships that i've had that weren't doomed from the beginning were doomed by me....  i know the men involved were equall as guilty also, but i see that where my share of the blame is.  i need to open my big mouth.  i seem to be able to open it when it's not necessary, but when it is most important-i seem to clam up.  well i know that seeing where i go wrong is the first step to trying to change...step, step, step...

      i finally found that moment.  that moment in life that i wish i could go back and do again.  actually there is three of them.  but they would all change the same outcome.  why didn't i open my mouth on the phone?  why didn't i say something when he got there?  why didn't i speak up after the incident?  it was me, the whole time, not him.  i can see the look in his eyes that meant everything changed.  but i can not go back, i can not do it again.  all that i can do is wait for a similar moment and try to do things right this time and hope that is tips the scales of karmic energy back to neutral....

      welcome 2004.  should i make those empty resolutions now?  should i vow to lose weight, make more money and quit smoking?  or maybe something simpler is in order.  how about just resoluting to be happy.  to enjoy all of my good friends and family.  to make the best of that which i can not change (will i get into grad school and will i get an ra position?).  is it the end of the world if i don't get everything i want?  if i find love, so be it!  if not, kool, i got lots to do w/o someone getting in the way.   so here is my official new years resolution:  to enjoy that which i have, while i strive for more!

      i'm looking for some inspiration right about now.  i may not get into grad school, so why am i bothering to apply for an ra position?  and how nice, i'm in collections 'cause i can't pay for my emergency room visit.  sorry, but i gotta give the school $600/month till i pay them off.  and don't forget trying to get my readings done.  gotta get those good grades.  i'm sitting here alone, feeling very alone.  isn't there anyone out there who wants to give me a hug?  must i always ask for one?  isn't the look on my face enough to let ppl know somethings wrong?  if this all works out i'll be set.  i'll finally get medical insurance, get into grad school, have some $ and be on the road to success, if not then i'm bound for a life of white-trash.  now do i read?  do i curl up and hide from this big and frightening world?  hmmm...

      yeah, i was dumb.  i gotta stop expectin good things from ppl.  alls that ends up happenin is i'm disappointed and they think that sayin 'i'm sorry' is enuf to make thangs all better.  those words mean as little as 'i love you'.  ppl say them to get what they want and not much more.  i want sumone to prove me wrong...just one person.  is that askin too much?  yeah, i know i'm melodramatic.  it's 'cuz i'm also idealistic.  one day my ideals will not be in vain.  one day i'll meet sumone who shares them and strives for them just as i do... untill then i'll fake it and hope that that day is the one that i will find tomorrow...  ps. on a side note.  keep in mind that all of this is comin from the person who is supposidly a cold-hearted bitch.  that just shows how little ppl know 'bout me.  i feel thangs just like everyone else, probably more.  but go ahead and keep judgin me, ur just assumin i'm like u, but i couldn't be more the opposite!

      The clock is ticking. Stop watching it or your blood will boil  long before the water for your coffee. You seem to have scheduled  yourself into a dead end. Whether through spite or accident, the person  that keeps you waiting will probably never be ready. Expectations trail  off into the nebulous world of dreaming. You have better things to do  with your time. Move ahead on your own. Send back news of your progress.  The further you get from this point, the more obvious it will be that  you made the right decision. Never doubt that  the stars are looking out for you.  -this is what my horoscope told me this morning.  it is the reason that i didn't walk thru best buy today.  no matter how much i'd like to prance past him w/my hair done and tight jeans on, it just wouldn't be right.  while sum part of me may be wishing that he's make sum sort of grandeos effort to try to get me back, i know it won't happen.  it's over.  in time i'm sure it will sting less, but for now i'm gonna fake it.  i'm sure 300 miles will help this summer.  it's not like he'll call or anything. -on a more happy note, i'm graduating tomorrow.  sumday is finally here!  they will call my name and i will walk across the stage and suddenly things will be different.  my ged won't mean i'm a failure, it will be stage one in my success story.  i will have a bachelors degree.  it means that a piece of paper will mean i haven't been wastin my time.  i've known these things all along, but now i will have the proof.  i did it.  no cheating, no shortcuts.  i earned my ba!  i am a college graduate.   -yea! to cheyenne- there is no one else like u! -yea! to sylvia - ur kool ppls and it's bout time that chicks learn how to not be a man's toy! -yea! to jenn-ur weird, but that's why we keep u round.  but u gotta watch the flakiness!! -yea! to greg- holla to w.w. and fatness and ciggies!!!  i can't wait to c how u rock this world! -yea! to farhan - ur a good friend and will go far!!!  i'm so glad that our deathly habits made us talk!!

      graduation is gettin closer an closer!  so much has happened in the last two years and i've learned so much 'bout myself and other ppl.  now i'm learnin that change kicks ass!!!  i got my hair all done up, nails done and eyebrows done.  talk 'bout a make over!!  it feels good to be so versitile.  it also feels good to stick to my guns.  it's not always easy, but i gotta look out for #1.  it is my most important job.  there r ppl i wished would be around for a while, but they choose to exclude themselves.  it's all kool.  i'm good and that's what's important.  so i'm off to paint my toenails now, as if i wasn't hot already!  hehehe...

      i'm not sure y i'm so aggravated.  part of it has been me bein hyper an my friends bein lazy.  how many times have i walked w/them to get food.  isn't that what friends do?  but when i wanna do sumthang that doesn't involve food, no way.  good forbid sumone get off their lazy ass for me.  that's not all of it tho.  i'm not sure what the rest is.  but drivin 'round by myself ain't helpin.  i just feel so disconnected rite now so isolation is the worst thang for me.  whateva.  i know that they got tv shows an movies to watch.  and oh yeah, it's hot out.  i'm not mad at anyone, just irritated w/the whole situation.  if ppl would shut up for 2 min i would try to tell them this.  oh well...sooner or later...

      ~~Focus, focus, focus. Today you excel at putting things into little boxes, and the satisfaction of creating neat packages has you hopping up and down with glee. Categorizing and classifying are important parts of analysis. Your curiosity takes you deeper and deeper into the channels of some great mystery, and you are enjoying the hunt. Your innate curiosity leaves you fascinated with others. Keep you finger on the pulse of the underground.~~  this was my horoscope today.  not even funny after an 8 hour day of putting toothpaste into boxes!!!  sum1 has a sick sense of humor!!!

      who woulda guessed it?  buffalo isn't that bad afta all.  i mean, it is still a pretty crappy city, but it's not all bad.  now that i'm out there and meetin ppl, i'm realizin that there are kewl ppl everywhere.  i'm not sayin that everyone i've met is stellar, but they are all worth knowin.  all of a sudden i got game.  who woulda thunk it.  maybe it was partly my attitude that pushed ppl away.  but it's all good.  alot of those ppl deserved to be pushed away.  anyone who wants my time will hafta give me sum of their time also.  i need ppl who will meet me half way.  i'm not into policing, psychoanalyzing of babysitting anyone.  i'm glad that i've finally met ppl who don't expect all of that from me.  they are forth coming and honest.  they are willing to give sum to get sum.  live is good.  this city isn't evil.  but i still miss albany.  i'll be home soon tho, in the mean time i'll keep busy w/my wny ppls...

      You could be my silver spring, Blue green colors flashing.  I would be your only dream, You're shining autumn Ocean crashing  And did you say she was pretty? And did you say that she loves you? Baby I don't want to know.  I'll begin not to love you, Turn around, See me running.  I said I loved you years ago, I tell myself, You never loved me, no.  And did you say she was pretty? And did you say that she loves you? Baby I don't want to know.  Oh, no.  And can you tell me was it worth it? Really I don't want to know.  Time casts a spell on you, But you won't forget me.  I know I could have loved you, But you would not let me.  Time casts a spell on you, But you won't forget me.  I know I could have loved you, But you would have not let me.  I'll follow you down, 'Til the sound of my voice, Will haunt you.  You'll never get away, From the sound, Of the woman that loves you.  I'll follow you down, 'Till the sound of my voice, Will haunt you.  You'll never get away, From the sound, Of the woman that loves you.  I'll follow you down, 'Till the sound of my voice, Will haunt you.  You'll never get away, From the sound, Of the woman that loves you.

      ~~your personal radiance inspires the people around you. You exude positive energy in such a way that others can't help but feel infused. Success or romance feels like a foregone conclusion. The two can be combined for a powerful duo. Filled as you are with questions, you have nothing to hide in your pursuit of the answers. The pursuit will actually be the most fun. You are likely to end up with answers you had never considered due to the experiences that you encounter along the way. ~~ my personal horoscope for 7/27  *yeah fuckin right!!! the answers i wanna hear i won't!!! but it doesn't matter cuz i'm toasted on cheap ass wine!!!&nbsp; nothin like cheap ass wine to cheer up a rainy buffalo nite!!! cheers to getting the hell outta town!!!!  hell yeah baby!!!

      "This ain't a song for the broken-hearted  No silent prayer for the faith-departed  I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd  You're gonna hear my voice When I shout it out loud  &nbsp; [Chorus:] It's my life It's now or never  I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said I did it my way  I just wanna live while I'm alive It's my life  &nbsp; This is for the ones who stood their ground  For Tommy and Gina who never backed down  Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake  Luck ain't even lucky  Got to make your own breaks  &nbsp; [Chorus:] It's my life And it's now or never  I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive  'Cause it's my life  Better stand tall when they're calling you out  Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down  &nbsp; [Chorus:] It's my life And it's now or never  'Cause I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said I did it my way I just want to live while I'm alive  &nbsp; [Chorus:] It's my life And it's now or never ' Cause I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said I did it my way I just want to live while I'm alive' Cause it's my life!  &nbsp;&nbsp; ~Bon Jovi&nbsp; It's my life!

      Late at night I close my eyes And think of how things could have been And when I look back I remember some words you had said to me  It’s better to have lost at loveThen never to have loved at all  I won’t forget you baby Even though I should I won’t forget you baby Even though I should, yeah  Sometimes in my head I can still see pictures of you And I laugh to myself When I think of all those crazy things that we used to do  Although miles come between us Just between you and me  I won’t forget you baby Even though I should I won’t forget you baby Even though I should, yeah  I should let you fade away But that just wouldn’t be me Oh, baby  Although miles come between us Just between you and me  I won’t forget you baby Memories slowly fade I won’t forget you baby And all the plans we made  I won’t forget you baby  ~~Poison - I Won't Forget You~~

      life is funny.  what i think i want is never as good as i thought it would be.  i've been to numerous weddings this summer and there is two things i know for sure.  first, if i ever get married-i will elope.  screw all that drama.  and second, i don't want to get married.  i may change my mind sum day.  but right now, i like have a man (or men) in my life to spend time with and make sure my needs r met.  but that's all i want.  i don't even want the sort of boyfriend that i hafta call 4x a day.  i want men that i talk to regularily and enjoy goin out w/an spendin time with.  fuck this marriage crap.  i don't believe in forever, so y would i ask for it or offer it up?  maybe later.  but not now.  till i change my mind i will enjoy my solitude and treasure every quiet morning....

      ugh, i'm so annoyed right now.  i hafta keep believin that thangs will get better.   but even that doesn't stop things from suckin rite now.  i hate being broke as shit.  i don't know how i'm makin my car payment(s), my cell phone bill is massively overdue, and i'm depressed.  i'm not happy w/the way things are now.  i feel like shit.  mentally and physically.  i'm dreading goin to mrs. foster and askin for a loan.  but i don't know what else to do.  i wanna go back camping.  i don't wanna deal w/all of this.  i don't wanna care 'bout my future, today or yesterday.  i wouldn't mind stayin drunk for a few more weeks 'cuz then i wouldn't give a shit...  but i can't... so back to the real world and back to stress and headaches...
