      there, i hope you are all real happy cause i updated my mother fucking blog.  i'm not happy but how is that different from any other day.  great great now my fuckin music won't play. this has to be the shittiest day of all time.  go to the curling rink cause amanda says that we are supposed to curl tonight and we aren't and she doesn't show up.  i have shit loads of home work, like it will ever get done.  the guys lost at pictonary in bio i have 2 tests tomorrow, and i think i should be working this weekend.  i really hate this.  although the pictonary was so rigged, the girls had the damn teacher, how could they lose.  especially when one of the carogories is biological or chemicle structures.  i hate school, i think i should quit, but then i can't even get a job a mcdicks.

      in 1776 thomas jefferson signed his name on a leaf of marijuna.  betcha didn't now that, and that leaf gave birth to the stupidest country in the world. a place where people can carry guns where ever they want but if they use it they get arrested.  if you can't use it what is the point of having it.  there isn't one.  kurt says that he wasn't dying yestarday but i really think he was, or maybe on crack, but he says hes not that either, not like that big crack head lance.

      old king cole was a marry old soul a marry old soul was he, he called for his pipe and he called for his bolw...i wonder what they were talking about.  why can't everyone be like old king cole, happy.  everyones mad at everyone, cause hats and cds and kelseys and screaming and its not fun. kurt and kayla and sarah and why cant you be fucking friends.  mary had a little gram, but all grams are little, i can't spell, maybe i should get hooked on phonics, it worked for all the other idiots, even some in the states and they are the stupidest kind of idiots.why don't the states use the metric system it makes so much sense.  its so easy.  you can get 240 hectares on a single tank of carosene, which is the same as getting 40 rods to the hogs head.  Oh and the plant is fine...don't be chilly cause chilly ain't never been cool.

      Ladies and gentlemen i Scott "Satan" Mitchell have a new out look on life. I have realized that its not the simalarities between my friends and i that make me like them, i like them for there difference, and who they are. Kurt and his crazy phsycotic unexplanable behaviour, kelsey cause she is ever so screwed up, its funny, laney cause well hes laney, he always nows what i'm thinkin, not like the fat free yogurt thing (only kurt and i will understand that). Vance is one crazy ass son bitch, and i am glad that he is there, b-rock is the most super passive smart person i know. he knows everything. it like " hey b-rock whats the capital of nevada?" and hes all like "its carson city you dumb shit" although i have never heard him say shit, its kinda wierd. And if i went on i would never ever get to sleep. but there is one more that i need to mention, Tara. I was reading her blog and i realized that for years i have been so wrong. so in closing i say this, to any one i have ever hurt in any way, i'm sorry.   and i don't often apoligize for anything so this is a big step for me:)   oh and this entire being mad thing has to stop, its really quite stupid. and if there be any way i can help at any time, i'll probably be home, i lead a very boring life.

      BBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  now that thats over with, this was a fucky day, laney wasn't there in the morning but he was at noon, i felt like death first peiod then by second i didn't, armestead screwed my dodge ball team over, that short bastard, he pushes the end ball, the only one we ever get off the start, lets his team cheat.  And then bucyk told me that if i bought a cookie she wouldn't give us home work, but she wasn't going to any ways.  She screwed me.  Long and hard.  how come you never see pictures of hell. and all angles are tall and blond...where is everybody else?  It doesn't make sense.  And now George Carlin is coming, so if i have money i will so be going cause he rules.  all my news is bull plop, BULL PLOP

      damn computers. everytime i get something done they find a way to fuck me over.  i had just finished updating and when i told it to "post & publish", it decided to have an error. and it wouldn't let me reload the damn page, and now i don't remember what i was talking about...except (dream sequence)  something about chuchs getting hit by tornados and race car drivers punching them selves in the head...oh and of coarse the part about tara being wrong and kurts story being right.  and it makes sense cause it has midgets, midgets.  and flying fire breathing monkies.  and bishnu.    kpasa...k watcha call your pasa.  I have the only weather forcast you will ever need... tonight DARK, and continuing dark through the morning,  but thats not all oh no, the weather will keep on changing on and off for a long time.  i have a plan for kurts birthday, we all go to his family liqour store, also known as the pantry, and take it all to the basement, what a night that would be.

      Ok well kelsey said just about everything i wanted to but her starting wasn't what min was going to be so... START  FUCK OFF YOU BITCH.  what is up you ass, or is it what do you want up your ass that you can't have.  Sure at one point i was mad, but lets face it people i have anger problems, and up until just recently i was always mad, but now i except things (thanks to my number roughly 7 hero Tara).  You are so jelous, face it you want him but you aren't going to be getting him, EVER.  Oh and as for her spelling, atleast its better than you slbo like grammar, "IS THAT REALLY THAT HARD TO SPELL 'HYENA'".  it should read is IT that hard to spell hyena. and up until tonight i couldn't spell it either, by tomorrow i won't be able to, and i don't give a flying fuck.  Kurt is not going to get hurt, and if he does, there are many people that he could go to for help.  he knows that.  But it won't happen.  In the wise words of the great british band The Who "who the fuck are you".  What kind of friend are you if you can't even be happy for your friends when there happy.  Kelsey is a good person, and she knows that hell you know what Kelsey you are a great person, better than melisa as a matter of fact.  Kelsey does have the right to get mad at you, because YOU ARE BEING A BITCH. you want kurt she got hime.  be happy for him, he's happy now.  And that makes me happy.  Kurt you better stay fuckin happy to cause i need someone to make me happy.  Sure she may not be able to stop you from "representing your feelings", and what the fuck does that mean anyway, but maybe if you stopped being a stupid naggy jelous bitch she wouldn't have to stop you, you would do it yourself.  sure kurt is a mutual friend, but face it melisa there are certain people that you like better than others and kelsey is that person (hopefully i'm still high on that list) and you will never be there.    And the part that pissed me off even more "CALGARY STAMPEADERS KICK ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! " FUCK YOU BITCH Eskies all the way, the cup comes home, to Edmonton not calgaary, oh wait Calgary doesn't even have a chance. Hopefully tomorrow i will be in a good enough mode to post the good news i had.  I was going to do it tonight but because of you now i'm pissed.  I NEED BOOZE OR DRUGS.  Or something that will give me that same feeling. END  thats it g'night

      Like a dog with out a bone.  The doors totally rule, although there is speculation that jim morrison was gay, but i don't think he was.  95 hours until the hockey game, thats 5700 minutes, or 342000 seconds. That really doesn't seem like much, but i am really excited.  Some times ya feel like a nut.  I don't know why i said that. its odd how when your typing things just come out.  oh and i found out that jesus' brothers name was Bob, which makes sense cause the song is called jesus' brother bob.  its really cold, i don't like it.  why isn't it summer, then it could be my birthday, and warm.    Keep on rockin in the free world people.  it can only help

      No one knows what its like to be the bad man...to be the sad man, behind blue eyes what a great song, it totally expreces how people can see one a person as one thing when the person is the exact oppisite.  i think i have finally compiled my list of heros 1. Steve Austin - meanest sob that ever lived 2. Steve Erwin - dumbest man a live but intilled of love of reptiles in me 3. Kurt - CRAZY 4. laney and vance - no real reason but they have to be there   thats as far as i've gotten for now, but eventualy i will complete it. Damn you, Damn you all i dunno why but your all damned.  DONT YOU WANNA RAIN DANCE  if vance tells you something is good always beleive him, he's never wrong, like with the coral, he also says the doors rule.  Vance is no chumpsain not like that damn cole, what a rekazoid. i think thats it for now, but i'm not sure so it will be  bye all

      oh life is good for once. i am in the absolute best mood of my life. i have never been happpier.  My entire day was good.  especially the end.  Kelsey and Kurt know what the hell i'm talking about, but thats it, no one else.  All my troubles have seemed to melt away it the last little while, i am completly relaxed (finally no risk of a heart attack).  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

      ok melissa we all know that it was you that was concerned.  And now you are trying to cover it up.  Well guess what its not working.  If you didn't give a shit YOU wouldn't have posted it in YOUR blog.  And i don't care if the football thing, football is all this city has, look at the hockey team, they suck.  so you chose to hangout with other people, no one cares.  and being a stuck up bitch isn't a good thing, it makes people dis like you, i would even go as far as to say hate you.  You do like kurt, you told me and i qoute "I am jelous", this being your response to the question why don't you like kelsey.  alright thats it bye

Life is acually going my way for once.  things are great, and i know that i'm not dreaming it all.  although it felt like  i was for a while, but tara told me that it was real.  According to driver training guy i have a speeding problem, but who doesn't go 20 over.  and residential areas, who cares.  its more fun in there.  thats about it, just had to say i had another great day, thats a new record, 4 in a row.

      november 27th, that was a hell of a long time ago, so, lets play hardball. what the hell is wrong with you people.  its like you want to go throught this "lets pick sides" thing again.  Its fuckin stupid.  if you don't want to be near somebody, don't.  If you don't want to talk to them, don't.  its not that hard of a thing to figure out.  lance is the only one acually doing it the right way.  maybe people should take some fucking lessons.  but this can't all be blammed on us.  Kurt, its not that like people are trying to lose you as a friend, thats the last thing I would want, but you spend all your time with her, you follow her every where, you do everything she tells you to do.  its not that people don't want you as a friend, people just don't want the two of you to come as a package, your friend but not hers.  and thats how it is.  lance is the onl smart one out of all of us, and brock.  cause brock is like, super smart.

      warning to all: if you are easily offended don't keep reading, or do and don't start bitching about how i offended you, not so much in this post, cause i don't think i'm gonna write too much offensive stuff. i think.  and also, there is nothing anybody can do about anything i say on here because it is a personal oppinion page.  just like everyone elses.  personal thought o' the day: Iraq? Where the hell's Iraq?  where to start? the begining, ha not funny  all right i'm rieady, lets play hardball kurt, how did you do the cool dotty do by the names, i just dont get it.  i recently got some more great wisdom from my sister.  your not always going to like who your friends go out with, so deal with it.  its good advice.  almost as good as doctor phil. he wants top be miss america.  but i have to say a few things.  talking shit behind peoples back is human nature.  i do , you do, kayla, sarah, melissa, and yes even kelsey do it.  i haven't started lashing yet.  when i do, it will be much more worse, if i do.  Erveryone else (including kelsey's mom if she wants to read it, its really her choice as it is evryones): after reading the all the posts on tara's blog, i see no threats made against anyone, not even underlying threats.  just because tara thinks something about kelsey doesn't mean that its the same for her parents.  There is nothing the school can do about any of this.  not on;y because its personal oppinion, but because no one forced kelsey to listen, or her mom to read for that matter.  Could somebody please explain how kelsey is a victim, how come she can say things about us, but we can't about her.  maybe before you make an oppinion on something, you should hear the entire story.  i am happy for kurt, hurra, yey kurt.  but there are certain things  and people that i don't like.  When did vance get involved?  he doesn't care (this after discussing with him the fact that 1. he doesn't care. 2. he doesn't want to lead us).  Why would we need a leader anyway, it just don't make sense, like chubaca, he just don't make sense.  Damn i missed a part. "you WILL lose Kurt as your friend".  that is being just a bit heisty.  there are resolutions for everything.  i have already come up with a few, problem is they all suck.  As i was told by a wise man once, "when you assume things, you make an ass out of Scott", Scott being me.  and helpful hint for poor typers like myself: "y" is above and slightly to the left of "h".  Thats it i'm done, until people do more stupid things, and that likely to be soon.

      ok so my prognosis... my this thing hurts (pointing to thing that hurts) and i blam it all on kurt.  but it was damn fun.  vance is so smart.  his blog is funny.  he like totalyy understands y people are happy.  he got it so right.  noel needs to update.  i'm not done talking about vance's rightnesss yet, but i guess i am as i have changed the subject.  i am now theorizing that we shalt be going to war.  this is good for people like me, if they feel i'm sobber/sane enough to shoot a gun.  but they probably wont cause they're like...stupid and stuff.  but then i can like run screaming into a hail of bullets, its always been a dream of mine.  y does it feel like the room is on a slant.  i think thats a bad thing.  all this and andy rooney tonight on six-ty minutes.  i'm tired, and RAW is starting. i  leave now

London you renownce your BELIEFE in god not you believe.   Dr.phils words of wisdom:  call your wife a bitch i'm gonna beat you up i don't know what i'm doing i want to be miss america i am offering you sex.  eventually there will be more, but thats all i can remember.  thats it.....for now

I'm not trying to make things change, i'm just being polite.  Maybe your not used to that, but (according to the dictionary) its: showing good manners toward others, as in SPEECH.  I talk to you because you talk to me.  thats all  Its going to be the Hissal from Shisal

      london, sorry if i gave you the wrong impression, i don't absolutly "hate" you, if i did i would be plotting your untimly dimise, which i'm not.  Its more like, at times, you can be horrifically annoying, forcing me into a minor version of hate, still not plotting.  Last week was just one of those weeks.  But, you weren't the only reason that i wasn't going to go, as a matter of fact, you were less than 1/8 the reason.  Next week, i probably won't hate you again.  its like on of those things, ya know, on the wall, does the, flicking...a light switch thats the one.  It goes on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off and on and off.  although it only does that if you stand there and flick it for a while.

      "Now everybody has got the choice Between hotdogs and hamburgers Every one of us has got to choose Between right and wrong And givin' up or holdin' on" John Mellencamp- hotdogs and hamburgers  for once my quote acually ment something to me.  I had it all planned out, it was all going to work, then, like an idiot, i thought about it.  Thinking ruins everything.  I realized that killing London would only solve things temporarily, cause soon i'd end up in prison which, occording to t.v, is not a good experience.  So then i thought well why London, why not...me?  Then there was good old mellencamp, i have to choose between givin' up or holdin' on.  But then it also came to me that i haven't been this mad in along time, and it made me happy, happy to be mad.  I think im going crazy.  So i'm gonna hold on.  I'll live life the way it should be lived, looking forward to the better things, not dwelling on the unpleasantries.  Like hoop it up, looking forward to that, and summer, and grad, and well thats all i can think of, i used all my thinking power earlier, now i'm all out.

      so ok, i finished reading most everyones blog.  and fisrt, god dammit noel update, second, kelsey, you say i should "treat other people the way i want to be treated" but then you go bitch at everyone for anything, mainly kurt, does that mean you want people to bitch at you, or did you not think that through before you typed it out?  i think thats it for that.  on to important things, i learnt something to day, but not in school, i learnt not to hit your head really hard on towel racks, cause it really friggin hurts.  its a good lesson to learn, you only need to be taught once.

      "i would call him a retard, but that would be insulting to them" another lubo classic  how come theres bold, italics, but no underline.  what the hell is this.  the only one i ever use is the one thats not there.  work is hard, i think i'd rather be in school, but i'm not to sure yet.  oh before i forget, sarah you need to go on maury, or jenny jones, it could be like "my parents are overbearing, and its making me rebel, plus i have a secret and I dont know who my babys father is" (the secret is something else).  that would be an awsome eppisode, it would be like one of those two parters.

      "DUH which bush is for the boys?" a direct quote from lubo insulint shawn drule-chin  Sarah Woo i'm home and instead of calling you, i'm blogging you cause the phone is way over there *points to phone*.  sure it was only four days and i only worked on 2 and a half of them, but i got 32 hours out of it.  32 hours out of the 60 in 2 and a half days.  shawn drule-chin was the best part, we made fun of him for about 4 solid hours one day, while i was getting my ass beat at crib, man i suck at that game.  and the manager of the motel didn't understand english (cause he was chinese), which made me remember that i was supposed to call sarah when i got home (cause she also is chinese), thats not the reason i was supposed to call her but yeah.  i have a few days off now, i dont know what i'n gonna do, with out work i'm bored, which is sad cause work is exhausting but i love it.  i think thats all for now.  oh no, NOEL UPDATE...FUCK.  my head hurts, my feet stink, and i dont love jesus.   i could really go for some jimmy right now.

      209 days, 1 hour, 59 minutes, 15 seconds  The countdown is on  so whats new, well i got a job, i cant seem to find my mouth with a fork, i'm seeing a lot more of lance and brock, which is a good thing.  i'm going to calgary on saturday, it's gonna be really fun, i think i'll be back sunday but i dont know when.  other than that theres not much.  but i got my hair cut.  i was extremely sad, but i had to do it.  i've managed to spend $1500 on my self in the last 2 weeks, so now i have to start buying other people things, maybe i'll buy everybody stuff for christmas, thats a good way to spend my money.  ninja scroll is awesome, as is donnie darko, and bowling for colombine.  i should be studying, but i figure tomorrow morning, and at lunch to refresh my memory. I get to teach for like a week in Special Projects, so i'm gonna tape up the meter stick Gurny style, ans write "Smitten' Stick" on the side of it, then i'll smite people.  i seem to be getting smarter now that i talk to lance like everyday, well not like everyday, it is everyday.  to day he asked our sub chem teacher what delta H was, and he went on for 30 minutes.  30 FUCKING MINUTES, all because of one question.  i think thats it, oh the countdown is until my death by monkeys.

      192 days, 1 hour, 57 minutes, 35 seconds the countdown continues  interesting last few weeks, a lots of work, needs to be boycoted, i'm passing chem, lance is the best cheat helper ever, i can hide things in my mouth (not sexul) it was paper.  oxygen is fun, t&t smells funny, vance hits hard.  movies with large numbers of people are better than movies with small numbers of people.  spending money on things and not remembering is very easy, i want pie.  is it just me or is this turning in to a bob dylan song?  i'm stil alive although sometimes i wonder by how much, lance made me sick, DDR is hilarius, but i can some what keep a beat now, better than a month ago.  I think thats it, no brocks glowy pen is the best thing since indoor plumbing.  thats it.

      i'll do the countdown soon.  so i have been told by a source, one of many, that sarah and kayla have made a poor choice, so indeed i will have to be having a chat with step commrad woo woo, and kayla.  on to a lighter topic, vance laney has an idea, instead of backwards being yarr, it should be hence forth.  i think its a great idea, then there is no repetition of sounds in the words.  and people wont get confused.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY NOEL, time for a feild trip.  Also DDR is great, especially the music, its very adictive, i'm downloading some now.  so i think thats it.  oh wait, laney thursday.  184 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes, 54 seconds

      "grow some balls grelli, even if it is just for one day." me to the obvious  ok...friday was awesome, but, vance only played for like 30 seconds, which sucked.  the other bands did well, especially james' band, very well done.  saturday went and saw scary movie 3 with b-rock, not a bad movie.  Sunday, well, was like everyother sunday.  next weekend i work, but i still might go get my tatoo touched up, that way it's done and out of the way.  other than that i have no plans.  i need to take time to sit and ponder, but i dont want to today, and i dont know when else i will get a chance to, so it really sucks.  From now on i try to make only me happy, no one else, well maybe some people.    157 days, 8 hours, 1 minute, 15 seconds

My question is this, what the fuck needs 4-8 D size batteries?  its now official my dog is insane, shes excited because she got a new ball, that looks just like all her other ones.  and has been sitting here for 6 months.

      "i'll beat the shit out of a drunk customer, bash his head into the door and almost throw him over the belcane, but i wont fight with her in my studio." James the tatoo guy  ok so in response to kylas latest blog (jan 27 i think):  Care bears are still on?  holly shit.  i love that show.  it was awesome-tasti-fabulous when i was a kid, so it could only be better now.  ha bet you thought i was gonna talk about her ranting.  well i am.  you are right insulting people for say their sexuallity or how they dress is completly wrong.  They are still people.  but when you do what you do just for attention its completly different.  you do something because that what you like to do.  not to say that its not what london likes, but missing enough classes to get expled well, that is kinda dumb.  how ever, i am also not condoning lances post.  although it does seem that he is headed no where, and you may hate him with a passion, and you are only speaking your mind, that was kind of harsh.  making fun of people for who they are is wrong though, you certainly are right kayla kudos to you.  ashley, and otheres, may be a little light in her lophers, but who really cares, it shouldn't effect how they are treated.   now on to sarahs:  8 hole days with out updating, must be rough, i know how much you love to blog.  and being locked up like a prisoner isn't too much fun, but your free, go out and have fun.  i'll put this on both blogs so there is no hard times finding which one i am updating.

It makes me sad to see that 6 years has gone by so fast.  after doing some math, it works out to be over 18 continuous days on the mat, thats with out coming off, all wrestling.  thats nuts.  my social class is all idiots.  I left class for 20 minutes today and my teacher didn't mind.  these idiots in the class just make it shitty.  usually i dont mind social but these few people are making it into a class from hell.  other than that all my classes are great.  math is insanly stupid, and mechanics is well mechanics.  i'm gonna throw links on my blog tonight, it seems like it will kill time well.

      "Any gaurd wil do." tiffany  so two in two days,  new record.  go me.    so i really hate to have to do this,  but i think it needs to be done.  now i hate doing it on here, but it looked like fun.  i think we all need to grow up.  quite obviously, this has escelated to a thing that basically rotates around 2 ppl.  not to say that there aren't more involved, but mainly it focuses around kayla and sarah, and their falling out.  and its not to be blamed on anybody, because that wont fix shit.  there were misunderstandings, this led to things being said that shouldnt have been said, from there it was a downward spiral.  and now it has led into a wide spread disagreement.  it now incompases most of the group.  ppl are mad at ppl, and the ppl in the middle, saying they dont care.  well, its kinda obvious u do.  really there is no need for all of this.  its completly pointless.  its just gonna be a repeat of last year.  really the only one i feel bad for is melissa.  she is stuck right in the middle, seeing as she is friends with both, as am i, and all the others, but not to the extent of melissa.  now i realize this makes it seem like i dont care.  but for some stupid reason that i have yet to figure out, i do.  i would like this to end, so it can all go back to normal.  so if there is anyone, that feels that they need the help of me, i'm around.  i already talk to many ppl about it, so for future referance i suppose.    i'm srry if i offended anyone, or if anything i wrote is taken the wrong way, but i felt that it needed to be said that this is FUCKING STUPID. good night, sleep well, dont die, and remember my great rule...RELAX.

      " I'm not an alcoholic, I'm a drunk! Alcoholics go to meetings!" our good friends at www.dumbbumpers.com  and one for them smart kids (brocky) "Alcohol and calculus don't mix. Never drink and derive." again www.dumbbumpers.com  ok so it looks like i've found a new favorite website.  so dont be suprised if random quotes start poping up in posts.  so hows life for those who aren't me.  i'm sure its great, or not, depending on who u are.  anywho, its been one of those weekends that blows, but still rules.  i was going to go to the rodeo saturday, but the rides were all closed, so we didnt.  then on the way home i ended up helping some lady with her car.  turns out her alternator is shot.  sunday i was going to go to a car show, but it was all shitty out and what not.  friday i hung out with some of my peeps, watched jaberwocky.  i think te only one who will even know what the hell that is is melissa.  speaking of melissa, disappointed, me?, never.  u have your reasons and i'm sure they're good ones, and eventually we'll prolly talk about them.  seeing as thats what we do.    "Hell yes I'm drunk! what do you think I am, a stunt driver?"  So friday night i had some awesome fun.   i was up at merial martin hangin with peeps, and this hot chick walked by, and her not so hot friend screamed "my friend thinks your hot." so being the person i am i screamed back a few things, but i ended with a real me one "NICE ASS".  cause truely it was a nice ass.  she giggled a bit and walked off, then i ate more freezes.    "That's not a beer belly! It's the fuel tank for my sex machine!"  so i think thats it.  seems like i have said all that i feel like saying.  i'm sure that there is more that i could say, but i wont, not  yet at least.  so in closing, dont worry about the little things, the bees the trees, the whales the snails.  dont worry about the big things either, pollution, war, death, famine.  there is really no reason to worry about anything.  relax.  dont worry about getting hurt.  take the risks, thats what life is all about.  and if u really wanna learn dont regret anyhing you do.  that defeats the entire purpose.    " I rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy."  "Ossifer, I swear to drunk I'm not God!"  " Uh-oh, the doctor found traces of blood in my alcohol stream."  so i have no idea where any of that last part came from.  but it seems to me that it is an important lesson for some of you.  there seem to be a lot of ppl who are to up tight.  RELAX, dont take your self so seriously.

      "i dunno, i'd think a humpless camel is more of a short necked gerrafe" "it's be closest to a lama or elpaca" me talking to brocky.  i know, i cant spell, wanna fight about it?  so you ppl all officially suck.  UPDATE DAMMIT.  i'm so upset with all of you.  but now on to matters that matter.  so i might have a jib, thats right mw back in the work force.  lube-x called me today sos i have to call them tomorrow sometime.  so awesome.  i seemingly have a lot on my mind right now.  things that i would talk about, but i dont know how.  to onvey my ythoughts and emossions is far past my intellecual ability, hence i work on cars.  then i go on to write sentences like that.  but one day i'm sure all my mental delemmas will be resolved.  wow, i got my sisters key board hooked up to my computer and its so amazing.  i'm typing a million times faster and with fewer mistakes than ever before.  i've decided that i really enjoy iron maiden.  i decided that along time ago, but i'm only really seeing it now.  there songs all have a lot to them.  TOTAL ROCKAGE.  well i'm done

      "yeah, the alcohol can take the place of yor blood, rather than having to work its way in." me  well, i dunno what to say.  school is done.  toast day is over, and was great might i add.  teachers were impressed with the idea, students marveled at the fact that we were so smart, or maybe stupid, i dont know for sure, and we all had a good time.  will i ever see any of u again?  yeah, grad, after that.  some, i'm sure the ones that i really want to see i will, those of u i never see again, well its been great.  now we look on to the future.  i'm looking forward to the 10 year reunion, where we can all be back together, discussing who got fat, whos a bitch, and the that days generation and how they're music is just screaming.  then we'll bust out the macho man, that'll be cool.  its now time to leave all the high school shit behid us, still remembering the good times of coarse.  thats me, being sentemental, i'm gone.

      "i wonder what fox tastes like" me "hmm lets move to australia and ask one of the rabbits" tiffany  oh the ppl you meet on the internet.  so i saw that jeremy today, hes coming to after grad, now i have to talk to adam again tomorrow (turns out there are only 2 lepaks in the st.albert phone book, his mom and his dad) and tell him we have another car.  after work friday i have to go to melissas, PARTAY.  I'll get to see all the peeps from school.  then comes grad.    It seems like just yestarday i was having my first kiss (in kindergaden) (well daycare after class if you wanna get technical) i wont reveal whom as its totally not worth confessing, so i will say...nigel it was nigel.  or that i first met devon on the bus to school in grade 2, thats right a decade.  the decade of destruction, if we were the undertaker.    i've done so much in the last 13 years, it kinda makes me sad to see it all go.  then i realize, that right now is better than any other time in my life.  so really, the future can only be better, i hope.  also i like cake, so we need cake at after grad, i'll put that on the list.  well that seemingly is the end of this memory setion, back to the real world, where i dont know if i work or not tomorrow so i have to get up at 8 to call and find out.

      "what days i got off this week?" "i dunno u tell me" me talking to devon, apperently sleep deprived  well, i told melissa i would update so here it is.  life is good.  days go by slow at work sometimes, but other than that its pretty sweet.  altho i'm gonna have to work with out billy for a few weeks, and thats gonna kill.  man, moisturizor is yucky, it makes your hands feel all funny, but its so necessary.  otherwise your hands get all yucky.  so i've been up to so much lately, however a lot of it i dont want to put up here because is ppl read it the may not like it.  so if anyone really wants to know, you can always ask.  not much is really new.  i lead a rather dull life in that way.  i did see the bourne supremecy...word of advice...DONT SEE IT.  its absolutely atrosious.  the first one was good, and then this one was crap. and the village, well, not to bad, not what i expected, but not bad.  so, i really have nothing to say, when i do, i'll update again.
