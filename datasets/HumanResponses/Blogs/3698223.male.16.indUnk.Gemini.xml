      Well, youth conference just ended yesterday but I am still on an emotional high. I had so much fun getting to know people better! I got to start new friendships and strengthen old ones. How cool is that? Well, anyways, it was a great experience overall, even better than last year amazingly enough. Well, today I got ordained as a priest (in my church that's when you turn 16 for my non-mormon buddies). It was so cool. I was asked to bear my testimony and, true to form, I got all emotional and cried like a little girl, as stated in my previous testimony at youth conference. I was just overcome by the spirit and I cried, right there in front of all these 16-18 year old guys. Way to make a good first impression on the priest quorum, huh? Well, then I got to take the sacrament out to these 2 little old ladies in a nursing home with Alden. (Oh, by the way, Alden, you are a savage, bro. Thanks for being such a good example to me). It was amazing because it was the first time I had blessed the sacrament (I had only been a priest for about 30 minutes)and also because I sort-of got to bear like a mini-testimony to the 2nd old lady about how I knew she would get help with understanding the Bible if she just tried her best and asked God to make up the difference and help her get the rest of the way there. She was so happy when I told her this and it made me feel great! I still feel great! What a GREAT day! Well, I guess that's it. Happy Father's Day everybody, do something nice for your dads.

      Forgive me friends, for I have blown it. It has been two and a half weeks since my last entry. :)  Well, it has been hecka days since I last wrote because I have been so freakin' busy all the time. Listen to this: Monday-Friday:  8-10 tennis lessons ($10/hr) Wed & Fri: 10:15-11:15 different tennis lessons ($10/hr) Monday-Friday: Work at my dad's office for as long as possible after tennis (11/1- 4 or 5) ($10/hr) For about a week I did yardwork from about 6-8 after that for $10/hr. Also, I just got hired at Dairy Queen, which will start soon. It's all about the Hamiltons and Jacksons, baby!  Okay, so at least i was making a lot of money, but I have NO LIFE! So, if you read this and you are cool, give me a call so we can go do something because my schedule just freed up big-time. I really want to start hanging out with my friends because this doesn't even feel like summer, I'm busier than I was during school except I don't have homework. Oh, and by the way Lauren, I like the idea of a party over at your house. That would be a blast! I'm sure we could make things work a lot better so you wouldn't have to call people during the whole party. So, PLEASE, save me from myself somebody!
