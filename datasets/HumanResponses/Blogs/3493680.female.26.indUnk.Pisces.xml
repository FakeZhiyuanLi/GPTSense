      the comment was made that it would be a waste for me to abandon this blog.&nbsp; that's true, it is.&nbsp; it's been a good source for defending myself.&nbsp; but apparently it is taken so seriously by some people that they chose to get in their car, drive to lowe's, and interrupt dan while he's working to find out if he's okay.&nbsp; guys, dan chooses not to get involved with this blog nonsense for a reason.&nbsp; &nbsp;he can take care of himself.&nbsp; that's the reason that, if i do choose to post, they will be either impersonal or few and far between.  today is also my last day in my apartment.&nbsp; the reason makes me sad, but i won't discuss it here out of respect (and yes, i do respect you in that aspect) for the other person involved.  there are a few things i want to say before i sign off for awhile.....  danielle smith--i know you got back from france today.&nbsp; i hope you had a good time and that you and ray were able to work some things out.&nbsp; i'm happy right now and i honestly hope that you are too.&nbsp; i have chosen to create this blog in order to make sure both sides of the 'break-up story' were told.&nbsp; it was not created to lash out at anyone, including you.&nbsp; i've learned a very valuable lesson in the last couple of weeks....sometimes you have to let things go.&nbsp; i understand that you might have an opinion as to what is happening on these blogs.&nbsp; you know my email address and eric's if you have a comment.&nbsp; you and i have had our share of fights this year.&nbsp; we both know that i have never made a comment on your blog or ray's....or said anything spiteful or hateful about you on a blog anywhere else.&nbsp; we also both know that i have never responded on the blogs to anything that you have said about me.&nbsp; i'm politely asking you to do the same for me now.&nbsp; we've all been through enough.  dani darling--i just wanted you to know that i never once discouraged eric from being your friend.&nbsp; he will tell you that himself.&nbsp; he showed me the blogs that you wrote and the emails that you sent him and i asked him for months to tell you that he had a serious girlfriend.&nbsp; his reasoning was that you were not ready.&nbsp; i know you don't like me and yes, i have gotten mad when i read blogs that you wrote and it seemed like you were heaping alot of blame on eric, because he was telling me that you were always just a friend and that he hadn't even seen you in almost four years.&nbsp; i do understand that eric didn't speak to you for a long time while he and i were together.&nbsp; his refusal to tell you (and another girl that claimed to be in love with him) about our relationship made me insecure with our relationship.&nbsp; but i think that he may have thought that i was insecure with you.&nbsp; even though that wasn't the case, that might have been the misunderstanding.&nbsp; i know you just emailed eric recently telling him how you had felt about him.&nbsp; i hope that you will continue to be his friend and support him, because he really needs that right now.&nbsp; i've tried for three months to be his friend and encourage him....but i'm beginning to realize that my presence, whether in person or written, hurts him more, and i don't want that for him.&nbsp; this blog had not been intended to persuade people to choose sides.&nbsp; i was simply tired of my name and dan's being dragged through the mud and one side of the story being told.&nbsp; like eric said, quite fairly, this is my right, and i'm glad that he chose to link the spot to his so everyone could see it.&nbsp; but i am sorry that you had to hurt.&nbsp;   melanie--what can i say?&nbsp; God must have had a sense of humor when he made us sisters.&nbsp; thank you for your support for me, and dan, and eric.&nbsp; take care of scotti.&nbsp; we would be lost without him, too.  dan--you already know.&nbsp; much love.  eric--i'm sorry that i've made choices that hurt you.&nbsp; as far as my relationship with dan goes, the only thing i can apologize for is replacing you as soon as i did.&nbsp; you say that i should be sorry for ever beginning a relationship with him in the first place.&nbsp; you will never hear an apology for that one.&nbsp; you ask me not to lie to you.&nbsp; i did once, i'm not going to do it again.&nbsp; i will not apologize for something i am not sorry for.&nbsp; but i am sorry that you're making the choices that you are.&nbsp; you claim to love me and then tell me that you're going to kill yourself so that the blame will rest on my shoulders.&nbsp; i don't understand how that is love, and you're only making things worse for yourself.&nbsp; for the last three months you have had countless friends and family be there any time you need them and do their best to help you.&nbsp; you've chosen to ignore them.&nbsp; you claim to be open to other's opinions, but your retaliation to scotti's comments prove otherwise.&nbsp; you blame me for destroying your life, and then claim to be a christian and that you trust God.&nbsp; i just don't understand.&nbsp; but when i ask you these questions and you can't defend yourself with a good excuse, you try to turn things back around and point fingers at me.&nbsp; you keep telling me to destroy you....to say whatever i can to hurt you.&nbsp; i&nbsp;can't do that.&nbsp; there is enough hurt.&nbsp; i do love you and miss you as a friend.&nbsp; i wish things hadn't ended like this.&nbsp; but you can never say that i haven't been here whenever&nbsp;you needed me for the last three months, even though it&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;someone&nbsp;else that loves me, too.&nbsp; but i guess that means nothing.&nbsp; my one regret right now is that i've hurt dan for nothing.&nbsp; i've hurt him, hurt you, and hurt myself.&nbsp; so what&nbsp;was the point?  well, it's time to go now.&nbsp; i have to get my little sister/therapist/stylist off to work....even though she was up very late talking to eric (who once again&nbsp;showed zero tolerance to a different opinion).&nbsp; it's been a long night, and i have to start packing.  c'est la vie.&nbsp; praying for all that were mentioned, whether they believe it or not.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      i just read the current posts on eric's blog....   eric--although there have been many fights in the last three months, and i think you are wrong about a number of things, i can't disagree with you on your views about waiting for marriage.&nbsp; i believe that a number of things you said were both right and wrong.&nbsp; yes, the relationship did begin with alot of outside tension and some of that tension still remains.&nbsp; i just wanted you to know that your opinion will be read and discussed by both me and dan.&nbsp; i will not guarantee any outcomes or make any promises, but your opinion certainly has not been disguarded.&nbsp;   as far as the 'puppy love' comment, i choose to not make any replies.&nbsp; it wouldn't do any good anyway.&nbsp;   have to get ready for work....love

      i replied to a comment on eric's blog from a few days ago, but i would just like to add to it.  jenn-i understand that you are eric's friend and it comes naturally to defend him.&nbsp; i do the same thing with my friends, so i have no right to get upset.&nbsp; but you haven't been here for the last three months.&nbsp; eric's actions in the last three months have been a big deal.&nbsp; if you wanted to see a picture of us, that's fine.&nbsp; it could have easily been emailed to you.&nbsp; or it could have been posted long enough for you to see it and then taken down, which is what i have asked eric repeatedly to do.&nbsp; he still refuses to do that, and refers to me as a 'consolation prize.'&nbsp; this was hurtful to me and to my fiancee and his parents.&nbsp; after some yelling and a spiteful PUBLIC post on his part, along with refusal to take down the picture, i emailed the blogger hosts and asked them to take down the picture and the post....NOT his entire blog like he said.&nbsp; i believe i clarified that in a comment on one of his posts.&nbsp; trust me, if you had been here for the last three months and had seen everything that's happened (and i do mean everything...not just what he's posted or told you) it would be a big deal to you, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; on the other hand, eric did send me a copy of the email that you sent to him, and i'm very glad that you wrote what you did.&nbsp; i'm glad that eric has the friends that he does to support him.&nbsp; his friends here have told him the exact same thing that you did.&nbsp; i pray that one day he will start listening.

      yeah....soo....made $47 at work tonight.&nbsp; slow night.  good advice was given tonight.&nbsp; i do listen to you, eric, and i do respect your opinion.&nbsp; i might choose not to take the advice, but the advice does not go unheeded.  it has been a long day.&nbsp; i'm tired of fighting a losing battle.&nbsp; i'm sure eric feels the same way.&nbsp; i never wanted us to fight or call each other names.&nbsp;&nbsp; hopefully things will only go uphill from here.  i'm going to bed.&nbsp; still sick.&nbsp; and i have to go to tyler tomorrow to watch my mom get married.&nbsp; again.&nbsp; sigh.

      i haven't posted in a long time.&nbsp; truthfully, i tend to find alot of blogs are mainly used for lashing out at people and creating a haven for sympathy.&nbsp; i'm not going to do that.&nbsp; both sides of the story will be told here.&nbsp; i've lost one of my best friends anyway.&nbsp; so, as he puts it, "i don't care anymore."  for eric's friends that read this.....yes, promises that i made to him were broken.&nbsp; i promised him that i would always welcome him back and that i would not replace him anytime soon.&nbsp; i could tell that the break-up hurt him (and for clarification, yes, he did break up with me) and i wanted to make things as easy on him as possible.&nbsp; i didn't know those efforts would be used against me later.&nbsp; yes, he was replaced alot sooner than i anticipated, and i can sympathize with his hurt.&nbsp; believe it or not, it happened to me after a five-year relationship.&nbsp; except it wasn't the next week.&nbsp; it was the next day.&nbsp; yes, eric, other people (including myself) have hurt as much as you.&nbsp; however, i did make other promises, which included never turning my back on eric and always being there for him, which i never had or never will have any intention of breaking, even though eric has pushed me to so that there will be something else to blame on me.&nbsp; and yes, the im conversation is saved in my documents.  today i was treated as though all the efforts towards friendship in the last three months mean nothing.&nbsp; appareantly, i'm a spiteful bitch anyway.&nbsp; and according to eric's blog, dan is backstabbing and cocky.&nbsp; the fact that dan went to him first to ask permission to ask me out and the fact that he was ignored and the fact that he waited another three weeks for an answer was convienently left out.&nbsp; on today's blog, dan's parents were bashed for allegedly asking me to do their 'dirty work.'&nbsp; just for clarification, they didn't ask me to do anything.&nbsp; their concern is with me and with their son.&nbsp; i'm the one who asked eric to remove the pictures from the blog.&nbsp; appearantly, the "love" and "respect" that eric claims to have for me is gone.&nbsp; the picture was taken because a picture of dan and i was taken first, and i didn't want eric to feel like he wasn't just as important to me.&nbsp; obviously this is how my gesture was rewarded.&nbsp; i'm still a spiteful bitch.&nbsp; eric also claimed in his blog that he never called dan's parents asking them to make their SON leave me alone.&nbsp; he's right.&nbsp; he threatened to kill dan instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; and for some reason, blame is still placed on dan.&nbsp; yes, he was a factor to events that have happened in the last three months, but i have chosen not to go back to eric because of his continous reactions to these events.&nbsp; we choose our own reactions.&nbsp; dan did not steal anyone away from eric.&nbsp; eric left me all on his own.&nbsp; he claims that he didn't break up with me, he just 'stepped aside,' but for some reason that was never clarified during or after the break-up to me.&nbsp; it was only clarified when he learned that someone else was interested in me.&nbsp; but yes, i do accept blame for breaking some promises that i made, and for lying about my relationship with dan.&nbsp; considering eric had already threatened dan's life and his own, i chose to hide the truth instead of telling the truth and trusting God to take care of eric.&nbsp; and for that i'm sorry.  i would also like to make a public apology to dan.&nbsp; i know that for the last three months you have watched me hurt (and yes, eric, i am capable of being hurt) and that it's hurt you to watch.&nbsp; i also know that my continued persistance to be eric's friend and to keep him in my life has hurt you to.&nbsp; i realize that for the last three months i have put him ahead of you (even though most of the time it was subconsiously) and for that i am sorry.&nbsp; you don't deserve that.&nbsp; you've even made yourself sick over all of this.&nbsp; i know that you know how badly i wanted eric in my life and how much i miss him, and i'm sorry that you have to see me hurt like this.&nbsp; we have five months until our wedding.&nbsp; i'm going to do whatever i can to make better choices and to be a better girlfriend.&nbsp; i wanted to be a better friend to him, but as he put it today, i'm only thinking about what i want.&nbsp; i'm so sorry.  i made the comment to dan about four or five months ago that these two men were the two most important people in my life, and that i was so scared that i would lose them.&nbsp; one is gone, by his choice.&nbsp; and i'll have to respect that.&nbsp; but he made the remark the other day that i didn't look happy.&nbsp; now he knows why.
