       Its a wonder why people act the way they do. I dont understand where they figure they have the right. Okay where im going with this is, last night my father throw a huge fit on me about me not going to school. It wouldnt have been so bad if he hadnt threatend to take my child away from me, i mean come on, just for the fact that im not going to school every single day! I mena i get my hourse in like im suppossed to ( uselly) its not like i absoultly do not go i do. I just hate going there couse im not a crackhead and im not stupid witch is what my schools for im just a teen parent. I figure though this summer i WILL get a job and will move either movewith my special someone or back to portland but i will not stand by and listen to my parents threaten to take my child way. Oh by the way another thing they said was they thought i didnt love my daughter, now who in there right mind could tell me i dont love my child ( i will say again my child) dont you think if ididnt love her i would have choose to give her up when my mother gave me the chance. Even when i was pregnant i had the chance to give her up ( the morning after pill) and i wouldnt it was my choice to keep her and i wouldnt have kept her if i didnt want her and its not like i kept her to just have a baby. By the way the person who suggested that i give my baby up and who suppiled the morning after pill was my mother so i dont think she has any room to talk. Well thats my drama for yesterday hope you enjoy it more than i did. Be back another day!

        Its a Monday of course and I'm so bored I didn't go to school because I'm just so tired and I don't have the energy to go. But anyways on to a better subject, next weekend were (by means my whole family) going out to the lot (campground) well I wasn't going to go because I knew Jon wouldn't be able to go, or well thought. Well it came about that my mother asked my father if Jon could go with us and he actually said yes. The reason why I was so worried is because my dad is one of those people that is against older people dating younger people well so much younger I should say. Jon and I are eight years difference in age but that doesn't matter because I'm so mature for me being as young as I am. I had to grow up so fast I never got a childhood so I do feel as if I'm out of place if I hang out with other 16 years olds. For gods sake I had a child at the age of fifteen you cant really still tell me I'm a child. It hurts me that my dad is like that too because I love Jon so much I don't want to have to hide our relationship from him I want my father to know how happy I am and how good Jon is for me and my daughter. Also I have to hide that Jon and I have decided that he would like to take the role as being Justices father. That means so much to me because I know how hard it had to have been for him to do that knowing that she's not his biological child. Anyways I would love to tell my father that we've decided that he would be her father and I cant for another two years till I'm eight-teen. It scares me I'm afraid that Jon will get tired of hiding it and hell want out of this relationship.

        So yesterday i was with my man right everything was all fine you know and we were over at a friends house (the same one who lets her man control her) well my daughter had a wet diaper so i came home to change her. Well i was smoking and i set my cigerrette outside (no smoking in my house) and i told my boyfriend not to touch it just playing with him, well i went inside figuring he would put it out for me. So later i asked him if he put it out and he yelled at me! It made me rethink our whole relationship. It wouldnt have been such a big deal if he was like most guys but hes not he doesnt yell, shit ive never heard him yell in the two years ive known him, ive never even heard him raise his voice even when he was mad so that got me thinking. I was thinking that if i could get him to yell and we've only been together for two weeks something must be really wrong. So like i said i was thinking about just going back to us being friends but hen i talked to my sister and she was right. She told me that i expect him to be perfect witch is the truth i do. Only because in my eyes he is perfect ive never had a guy that was so  nice and careing, so gentle and loving, yet he knows what he wants. So when he does that (yells) it makes me mad becouse it shows hes not perfect and that hes only human. I dont know im so afraid im going to lose him that maybe im just pushing him away as a defense. One thing i do know is how much i love and care for him. I only hope he feels the same.

        My friend and I werent talking for a little while becouse of the fact that she allows her boyfriend to downgrade her and control her life and i myself do not think its right. Okay heres a story for all of you, May 18th I went over to her house w/ my daughter and my boyfriend, we were having a fine time till her boyfriend got home. He gets home and i knew he be mad about whatever it was jamie did wrong again ( i cant even member it was so pathetic) so he comes upstairs to her room and hes all quite, so i dont think anything of it i figured he would wiat till we left before he started bitching at her. WRONG! Jamie (my friend) Told me she would watch the baby so me and my man could go have a smoke. So we go downstairs and out side and like five min. later i hear them yelling. While my daughter was in the same room. So i went up got my daughter and left. I think thats purely disrespectfull i couldnt belive they did that right in front of my child.

       No we are not miles apart, But i cannot heal my withered heart.  These pains i feel, Not yet realizing that this is so real.  These pains in my heart,  As we fell so far apart.  The roses i gave so little and few, But every rose there has been  has said I love you.  You made me feel like a peice of gold, A peice of gold everyone wanted to hold.  My feelings for you will always be, But always knowing we will never see.  When you left me that day I died within, Not knowing that you could never love me again.  The things i said might have never been clear, Witch would release my worst fear.  For moving on is going to be hard, But ounce again my life will go on.

        Well yesterday was a very shitty day, I had to brake it off with my significant other (well tried to) but I couldn't do it because I love him more then anything and I don't want to loose him. I don't know how my life would be without him in it, but I know I don't even want to picture it. Anyways the reason why I was going to was the fact that in the begging og out relationship I had told him I will not lie about my age and yesterday I found out he told his mother I was 19 when I'm not. So I figured if he's that afraid to tell people maybe we should just wait till I'm 18 before we get serious that's it for now thought id let you know about it post more later.

        I have finlly completed the last step in makeing my relationship so perfect. You know it feels so perfect like we were made for wach other, i know your thinking about the age diffrence, well hate to burst everyones bubble but I had to grow up so fast a become an adult so fast that you cant really tell im so much younger then him. Besides age is just a number right. Anyways on with what ive got to say, Do you ever get the feeling when your with your special someone that even when your around them you cant seem to get close enough to them. Thats how i feel around him like i just cant breath in enough of his air.Its weird becouse when he leaves my house i can still smell the lingering of the last of his cologne, or im thinkinf about some nice he said that made me blush. Its amazing becouse ive been inlove before but never like this. I cant even descibe how i feel but i know i dont ever want to loose this feeling.   Okay now onto a whole other subject This summer Im thinking about going to stay with my best friend and my first love(her brother) but i dont know if it would be good for my relationship with my signifacent other, just in the fact that i dont want him to think im cheating on him then when i come back hes all rude to me. Witch i know he wouldnt be rude but you know what i mean in the back of his mind he would probly be wondering. Plus i dont want to do anything thats going to jepordize our relationship. I dont know how I would handle lossing him.
