						    My old man doesn't know me very well... he doesn't know what makes me cry, what makes me laugh; he doesn't know what I dream about, what or whom I long for in the blue shadows of the night.  My old man doesn't know where love has taken me... whom I've loved and lost, whom I've used and been used by; he doesn't know who has broken my heart, nor any of those whose hearts I've broken in my ongoing journey to myself.  My old man doesn't know me very well... but he loves me anyway... and perhaps, just perhaps, none of the rest matters much when all is said and done.  ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd.

						   We didn't fall asleep during John Kerry's acceptance speech at the end of the Democratic Convention last night.&nbsp; With the purposely lowered expectations that qualified as a homerun for the candidate.&nbsp; (Maybe it was just my imagination, but it seemed like both his wife and his running mate looked bored and disconnected at times while watching the speech...)   And so back to the campaign trail for Kerry-Edwards...with both "hope" and "help" apparently being on the way for us all...until the GOP puts on their own carefully micro-managed pageant next month.&nbsp; And then we will slog through September and October with, despite Kerry's somewhat disingenuous call to take the campaign to the "higher ground" (dude, that trick   never   works :-), increasingly negative back and forth.&nbsp; (In this I am glad that California is not really "in play" which will, hopefully, leave the candidates to spend their ad dollars elsewhere.)   And so it goes.   &nbsp;

						   I hope that John Kerry will indeed be the last Presidential candidate who needs to...or can...use the Vietnam War as a recurring theme in his or her campaign (or as a bludgeon to use against his opponent.)&nbsp; I don't want to forget it...it is an informing scar on our collective history that should forever teach us lessons about the way we deal with the world...but I'm tired of it being used as a litmus test for the Presidency.&nbsp;   I was 17 when the war ended (I remember this well because as I neared my majority my mother and I disagreed on what role I might take if it were still going on when I was eligible for the draft...I was, however naively,&nbsp;leaning towards serving because that's what the country might ask me to do; &nbsp;she was adamantly opposed to that path for what she saw as a pointless war)...31 years later it is still informing our political discourse with disproportionate emphasis.&nbsp;   John Kerry's service in the war was brave and worthwhile (as was, in my opinion, his willingness to protest the war after returning home) but I'm more interested in hearing his ideas for the future than reliving his exploits from decades in the past.&nbsp; Constantly using his former shipmates and other Vietnam veterans as props for his campaign comes off as exploitive and cynical. (Yeah I know...imagine that, &nbsp;cynical exploitation in a political campaign...that   never   happens :-)   Presidents Bush and Clinton and Vice President Cheney used the options available to some people to avoid having to slog through the jungles of Southeast Asia and that's, when you get right down to it, a choice they made in their own best interests...the same choices that many, many others in a position to do so freely exercised.&nbsp; Not being able to walk in any of their shoes, I'm willing to accept that their reasons were...for them and at the time (which was, of course, very different from this time)...reasonable enough and let it go.   Remembering the war is important...wallowing in it for political gain is tedious and myopic...and yes, again, cynical and exploitive.   *******   "Hope is on the way"....thanks, John, I feel so much better now.   *******   I'm not Al Sharpton's biggest fan but I have to give him credit for going off-script (apparently he gave Kerry's "vetters" one speech and then proceeded to give another, much more passionate...and, apparently, 18 minutes longer than its allotted time... oratory.)&nbsp; The dull convention needed to slapped out of its collective, stage managed stupor with &nbsp;a little purely partisan, firebrand preaching and Reverend Al delivered just that.   *******   John Edwards' story of rags to riches is inspiring and all that.&nbsp; BUT millionaire lawyers who made their fortunes by getting large fees from malpractice suits really should spend less time trying to convince&nbsp; us poorer people that they're still one of us.&nbsp; However hardscrabble your youth, John, you...like Bill Clinton...are no longer "one of us" (anniversary dinners at Wendy's notwithstanding)...deal with it.

						   From time to time, ideas come to me...lines, snippets of dialogue, even whole scenes...that have nothing to do with whatever I'm working on at the time. Sometimes these random writings are incorporated into full-blown pieces...and sometimes they remain as orphans, tantalizing teasers from the fickle muse that have no home. This then is one of the orphans which has been languishing in a file since it was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;This one is the opening scene of a novel...the second of a proposed trilogy that came to me as I was deep into working on the first (that first one, after many fits and starts,&nbsp;minor catastrophes and major fits of procrastination, is FINALLY reaching completion.)   ******   Moonlight danced golden off the soft aura surrounding her as she stepped onto the beach.&nbsp; She smiled, her body swaying in concert with the symphony of the surf, and looked back over the expanse of the dark Pacific...a part of her was already missing the embrace of the sea.   But then everybody had to come out into the light every once in a while...even her.&nbsp;   She didn't really feel the first impact.&nbsp; She had been reaching for her waterproof backpack and then, suddenly, she was sprawled in the sand.&nbsp; She found that she was curiously lightheaded and only then did she notice that there was blood oozing languidly from a hole in her abdomen.&nbsp; And, she found, she couldn't move.&nbsp; Through the front to the spine...a good shot.&nbsp; But she didn't panic...it would be okay, everything would be okay.   Above the din of the ocean, a clap of thundered pealed and another hole appeared in her shoulder.&nbsp; She still didn't panic...it was no problem, it would be okay.   He appeared out of the shadows.&nbsp; His face a mask without expression or nuance.&nbsp; He would be fairly good-looking if only he would smile.&nbsp; If only he would smile.&nbsp; He bent down and filled a small vial with her blood.&nbsp; He looked at the vial, holding it up to the golden moon, and then put it a pocket of his jacket.   She didn't panic when he leveled his weapon at her head.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked inward and made her peace with that which she found there.&nbsp; It was no problem...she was welcome.&nbsp; She was always welcome.&nbsp; She wished that she had had time to say goodbye to Tamara in person...but she would understand, her baby sister was far wiser than she herself was.   He paused and looked into her eyes.&nbsp; Something akin to regret was in his eyes fleetingly but he quickly banished it.&nbsp; "Nothing personal," he said.   He reacquired his target and, without ceremony, he pulled the trigger.&nbsp;   Lyla met the clap of thunder without blinking.&nbsp;  The Balance is  ever, she thought, her mind a placid lake, her body glowing ever so golden in the quiet moonlight,  the Balance is all.     ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd.&nbsp; All rights reserved.

						   The quadrennial political conventions used to be fun.&nbsp; They used to have an edge to them that kept political junkies (like me...from a relatively early age) engaged and alert.&nbsp; Even if the Presidential candidate needed only a rubberstamp (and, of course, most often he did) there was still intrigue enough to make the four days of long-winded speeches worthwhile viewing.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Passion came in the form of heated battles over planks in the so-called platform...tensions sometimes rising to the level that you expected a riot to break out at any moment (and in Chicago in '68 one actually did for the hapless Democrats.)&nbsp; Mystery came with the rumors about who would be the running mate (in '80 the hot GOP buzz about a proposed Reagan-Ford "co-Presidency" kept the reporters scrambling for days.)&nbsp;   There would fiery rhetoric castigating the opposing party and whipping the party faithful into a partisan frenzy and raucous demonstrations for candidates who had fallen by the wayside during the primaries but still resonated with those who believed in them.&nbsp; Politican conventions used to be controlled chaos and delightfully pompous pronouncements ("Mr. Chairman, the great state of Wisconsin, home of the best cheese, the prettiest girls, &nbsp;and the hardest working&nbsp; folks&nbsp;on God's green earth, proudly casts its 49 votes for the next President of the United States of America...")   But now the conventions have been completely sanitized for our protection.&nbsp; Micro-managed, scripted,&nbsp;and blanderized to within an inch of their lives leaving all of the spontaneity of a vapid stage show at Disneyland.&nbsp; Anything even remotely resembling controversy or real passion has been carefully excised from the proceedings leaving a dull, pointless spectacle designed to show party "unity" at all costs ("hey, there ain't no dissenting opinions here, pal, we're just one big happy family...")   The Democrats opened their get together with their old school all-stars unleashing rabble-rousing, but carefully vetted, broadsides at the Bush administration.&nbsp; Al Gore...the man who would be President, who is probably still cursing Ralph Nader, the Supreme Court, and the state of Florida for "stealing" his one and only chance at being in the Oval Office; Jimmy Carter, wrapped in the saintly glow of his post-Presidential good deeds; Hillary Clinton, the woman who would be President trying out the stage for size; and Bill Clinton, the affable rock star looking fit and &nbsp;reminding us that even though the "boy from Hope" was now a member in good standing of the richest 2% of Americans he was still on our side.   Every body in the hall cheered in all the right places and dutifully waved their carefully placed banners for the TV cameras but it was soulless and rote.&nbsp; Not any fun at all.   Next month, the Republicans will put on their own carefully choreographed pageant and it will be just as meaningless and hollow (though there is always the chance that the Vice President will go off script into full on, no prisoners taken&nbsp;attack mode...now that would be fun.)

						   Miami Dolphins running back Ricky Williams has decided that, at 27, he's had enough of being a professional football player...he's had enough of sacrificing his personal life to the glaring spotlight that being a celebrity in America shines on you.&nbsp; He's thrown up his hands and, leaving the $3.6 million (which could have&nbsp;ballooned to $6 million with incentive bonuses)&nbsp;he would have made this season on the table, he's flown off to spend a few months traveling the world&nbsp;in relative anonymity.   Good for him.   It's not good for the NFL.&nbsp; It's not good for the Miami Dolphins (who will desperately need a running back to fill the enormous void in their roster Williams' retirement creates.)&nbsp; But, if it's what he wants and needs to make himself content and happy, it certainly is good for Ricky Williams.   A lot of celebrities...athletes and actors and pop stars and the like...like to complain (and even whine) about the hardships of being rich and famous and sought after.&nbsp;&nbsp; The attention they would (and often did) sell their souls for on their way up the ladder becomes a horrible, intrusive&nbsp;burden once they achieve the levels of fame and fortune they lusted after so unabashedly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they&nbsp;feel put upon and trapped by the monster they themselves eagerly created (and yes, Madonna...or "Esther" or whoever the hell you're posing as this week...I'm talking about you among many, many others) and don't hesitate to share their "hardships" with us whenever there's a camera or a microphone around to document their pitiable torment.   Willaims says that he feels as if a burden has been lifted off his life...and I believe him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's probably got enough money to live comfortably for the rest of his life...especially if he's invested wisely...and the spotlight no longer holds any appeal to him.&nbsp; Perhaps he will go off and live a happy life offstage without looking back (like Barry Sanders before him)...perhaps he will miss the action and try to make a comeback in the next year or so (like, say, Michael Jordan once or twice)...but for now he's doing what is right for him and his peace of mind.&nbsp; We should all have such clarity in our lives.

						   There is a certain primal poetry in the way majestic horses run...an explosive, expressive ballet in the way they race egged on by the small athletes perched precariously on their powerful backs.&nbsp; I felt that poetry and experienced that ballet this afternoon during a day at the racetrack.&nbsp;   Del Mar..."where the turf meets the surf"...opened its season last Wednesday and we (my friend Miguel, a handicapper who peruses the racing forms studiously, and I, who chooses horses to bet on based on their names or their jockeys) enjoyed a cool summer's Sunday enjoying the "sport of kings".&nbsp; A pastime shared...in decades long gone...by Bing Crosby and Jimmy Durante and J. Edgar Hoover and countless others counted amongst the rich, the famous, the infamous.   The July 3rd installment of Bread and Roses recounted by last visit to this facility...the fairgrounds then a-bustle with activity during the annual Fair.&nbsp; This time the midway and fast food stands were gone, replaced by vendors hawking racing forms, beverages, peanuts, and popcorn.&nbsp; The transformation is both complete and barely noticeable at once...the grounds are ever welcoming whatever diversion we've come to enjoy.   I placed bets on 7 races...2 wins, 1 place, 1 show, an overall profit of $33.60.&nbsp; There are worse ways to wile away a few hours.   The racetrack is a wonderful place to watch people.&nbsp; Most people go just to have fun...to chat and try to guess which horse will run fastest...to enjoy the shared electricity of the races, shouting and cheering during the few dozen scant seconds that the mighty creatures speed around the grand old track.&nbsp; A few seem almost haunted...as if the results of the third race will determine whether or not they'll be able to pay the rent this month.&nbsp; And when the horses are dashing for the finish line, we're all one...sharing the thrill of the spectacle and happily getting lost in that unabashed sharing.   It's a lovely thing.

						   Walter Williams can fly.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; Not in a shiny airplane or even with majestic wings all this own.&nbsp; When he has a mind to Walter Williams can simply defy the arrogant tyranny of gravity and soar as high as courage and breath will allow.&nbsp; Walter Williams can fly.&nbsp; Like Apollo.&nbsp; Like Superman.&nbsp; Like every kid with the imagination to dream and the desire to be as free as the clouds and as unencumbered as the birds in the midday sky.&nbsp;   Walter has no idea why he can fly.&nbsp; He discovered this unusual fact when he was a boy but he never dared shared it with anyone.&nbsp; He was sitting on the roof of the apartment building he and mother lived in when he first realized that he had the ability to fly.&nbsp; Though he was always afraid of heights, Walter often dared the roof because it was the only place where he could be alone with his thoughts and his books and his festering envy of all of the kids to whom laughter and acceptance came so easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; The roof was cool and quiet and, most importantly, most often deserted.&nbsp;   Walter would sometimes venture as close to the edge as his phobia would allow and look down at the city some twelve stories below.&nbsp; But more often he just sat near the access door and looked up into the sky.&nbsp; And there Walter dreamed his dreams of merciless revenge on those in the most popular cliques who wasted only enough time noticing Walter and his friends when they needed to have cheap laugh.&nbsp; Walter dreams of dancing high in the sky...high above the petty, loud, foolish world...and leaving his cares as far behind as the wind the sky would allow.&nbsp;   On the day in question Walter was ten years old.&nbsp; He was up on the roof alone.&nbsp; His mother was at work and Walter had to taste for the company of anyone else so he had taken his diary up to the roof.&nbsp; The wind that day was blustery but not so strong that it gave Walter any pause.&nbsp; Walter had looked around, making sure that was indeed alone, and then looked up at the gray but only vaguely foreboding clouds.&nbsp; And then, satisfied that it was not going to rain anytime soon, he sat down and began to write in his diary.&nbsp;   Exactly what Walter was writing was lost in the crush of uncanny events that happened not long after his arrival on the roof.&nbsp; While he was lying back for a moment gathering his next thought, an impish gust of wind stole around the roof and seized the page of his diary that he had just been writing on.&nbsp; The wind snatched the page and tore it free from the book.&nbsp; The page went tumbling gracelessly across the roof.&nbsp; Walter's eyes with wide with panic, the thought of someone else finding and reading his darkest, most private word filling him with an unspeakable dread, and he leapt up to recapture the page.&nbsp;   The wind kept the page dancing just inches from Walter's grasping fingers until, quite suddenly, it just stopped.&nbsp; The page hovered as thought waiting for Walter to reclaim it.&nbsp; With a relieved sigh, Walter lunged forth and retrieved his prize.&nbsp; And then he fell.&nbsp; In his haste to save the page Walter had forgotten the edge of the roof.&nbsp;   The world stopped.&nbsp; Walter's eyes grew wide as he looked down at the city rushing up towards him.&nbsp; His hand went slack and the errant diary page fluttered away never to be seen by him again.&nbsp; Walter's heart slammed against his chest as if it were trying to get out and escape the fate the rest of his body was about to meet.&nbsp; Walter closed his eyes tight and waited for the end.&nbsp; He thought about his mother, praying that she wouldn't be the one to find his crushed body on the sidewalk and hoping that she knew that he loved her&nbsp;more than anybody even if he hadn't actually told her so since he was four years old.  He thought about the dreams that would never have a chance to come true...dreams of love and fame and courage, dreams of revenge and friendship and rebellion and glory.&nbsp; And as he thought about dreams, regret and sadness filled every fiber of his being and, for an instant, he was glad that things would be over soon.&nbsp;   And then the wind stopped rushing around him.&nbsp; Everything was still and utterly peaceful.&nbsp; Walter was astonished.&nbsp; Was that it?&nbsp; No pain, no sudden wrenching free of life, just sudden stillness and peace?&nbsp; He was, fleetingly, strangely disappointed.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Slowly, Walter opened his eyes expecting to find some kind of Heaven...or hell.&nbsp; Instead he found the city.&nbsp; And, to his amazement, Walter found that he was five stories above the street and seemingly just floating in place.&nbsp; Perhaps this was the first stage of death, he thought.&nbsp; Be he felt alive.&nbsp; His heart was pounding and his eyes were stinging and his throat was filled with bile and fear.&nbsp; The silence lifted and the sounds of the wind and the cars in the distance came crashing in on him.&nbsp; The chatter of television sets and people taking, arguing, and laughing came from everywhere and nowhere.&nbsp; Walter realized that he was alive and, more incredible, he realized that he was floating...or flying...or something....high above the city street.&nbsp;   Walter glanced upwards, at the great expanse of the cloudy sky, and he thought about soaring up to dance with them.&nbsp; The idle thought became action as Walter felt himself moving upwards, retracing his fall from the roof with awkward grace.&nbsp; He was flying.&nbsp; Like Apollo.&nbsp; Like Superman.&nbsp;   And for a moment, he gloried in it, his hands reaching up to touch the sky, to feel the clouds and the wind.&nbsp; And then, that sweet moment was gone.&nbsp; Old fears asserted themselves as he neared the edge of the roof and, despite his dreams and desires, all he wanted to feel was something solid underneath his feet again.&nbsp;   His heart pounding harder than ever, Walter reached for the edge of the roof and he literally threw himself onto it.&nbsp; Walter landed hard but he welcomed the pain because it proved that he was still alive.&nbsp; He scrambled back away from the edge of the roof, his breath coming in thick, heavy sighs and he looked back in disbelief.&nbsp; It was all a dream, he told himself.&nbsp; Walter scooted backwards towards the roof access door, not willing to stand up yet, and found his diary.&nbsp; The page was still torn out and gone.&nbsp; It was more than just a dream, he realized, but, in that terrifying instant, Walter simply didn't care.&nbsp; He shoved the diary in his pocket and crawled to the door and slipped down the stairs.&nbsp;   Outside the wing sang to him but Walter would have none of it.&nbsp; He never went out on that roof again.&nbsp;   &nbsp;In the days and weeks that followed, Walter tried to forget that he could fly.&nbsp; But every once in a great while he would take a step and find himself lingering in mid-air.&nbsp; It would make him smile, fleetingly, but then he would willingly surrender to gravity's rule once more.&nbsp; He never told anyone about his wonderful, terrifying, mystifying secret.&nbsp; Not even his mother.&nbsp; He was a boy who could fly...but he was afraid to do so.   Walter stopped dreaming around that time.&nbsp; Perhaps dreams were lost to anyone who had a wonderful dream come true only to refuse to accept it.&nbsp; Walter resigned himself to life on the ground...life in a gray world far below the blue majesty of the heavens...and accepted that reaching for the stars was those with bolder hearts than his own.   Years passed and Walter Williams tried to forget that he could fly.&nbsp; And, for the most part, he did.&nbsp; Every once in a great while, Walter would remember and he would indulge himself in a short flight, but never flying very far and never flying very high.&nbsp; He wandered through his school years leaving no lingering impression on anyone.&nbsp; After college, Walter found a job, married a woman of whom he was quite fond, and settled into a life of peaceful conformity.&nbsp;   On some soft nights, Walter would sit alone in the backyard of his cozy suburban house thinking of nothing more than his cozy suburban life until the kiss of the breeze or the sparkle of an especially bright star would make him look upwards.&nbsp; And for a moment he would remember that he could fly and, for an instant, he would contemplate doing so.&nbsp; But it rarely came to anything.&nbsp; Walter would sigh, more with disappointment with himself than out of any real sadness, and leave thoughts of the sky for yet another day.&nbsp;   Besides his wife, of whom he remained quite fond from the day her met her until the day he died, the brightest part of Walter's life was his Jessica.&nbsp; Gray as he often felt, his daughter could make him smile anytime he thought of her.&nbsp; She was vibrant and full of life and she loved him without reservation even though he was neither of those things.   In the blissful years before Jessica discovered boys, Walter was the only man in her life and he treasured that time forever.&nbsp; One night when Jessica was six years old, she came out as he sat in the backyard and climbed unbidden onto his lap.&nbsp; She rested back against her father and looked up into the sky.&nbsp; They spoke of the nearness of the moon and the vast distances separating the stars.&nbsp; They spoke of winged horses and comic book heroes and other beings who could ride rainbows, for these things were of enormous interest to well read, imaginative little girls like Jessica.&nbsp; Jessica sighed and told her father that she wanted to dance in the sky.&nbsp; Like Pegasus.&nbsp; Like Supergirl.&nbsp; She wanted to dance so high that the world would look small and far, far away.&nbsp; Walter hugged his precious child gently but he said nothing.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Jessica chattered away until sleep took her.&nbsp; Walter looked down on his daughter, so bright and full of life and dreams and brave imagination, and then he looked up into the sky.&nbsp; He could fly and yet he didn't.&nbsp; Perhaps Jessica could fly, too...perhaps she would one day.&nbsp; Or maybe, she would discover that she could but decide not to out of fear...fear of falling, fear of flying too high, fear of embracing all the vibrant dreams in her heart because she was afraid that they would let her down in the end.   Walter felt even more gray and afraid.&nbsp; But that was nothing new.&nbsp; He stood up, cradling his sleeping child in his arms, and listened to the sky.&nbsp; The night breeze was calling him as was the moon, warm and golden against the cool blackness of the night.&nbsp; Holding tight to Jessica, took a step up and he began to fly.&nbsp;   He didn't fly high that night, his passenger was too precious and his fears were not yet in full retreat, but he flew above the rooftops...flew to the edge of the welcoming sky. &nbsp;And when Jessica stirred and asked him if he was really flying, Walter told her&nbsp;yes.&nbsp; And he was.&nbsp; He was flying.&nbsp; Like Apollo.&nbsp; Like Superman.   Jessica smiled and sighed contentedly and she slipped back into her dreams, secure in the arms of her father.&nbsp; Walter surrendered, somewhat reluctantly, to the tyranny of gravity once more, and he glided down gently to this yard.&nbsp;&nbsp; He carried his daughter into the house and into her bedroom basking briefly in the light of his wife's fond smile as they passed her.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he tucked her into her bed, Jessica roused just enough to ask if they could go flying again sometime.&nbsp; Walter kissed her forehead and promised her that they would indeed.&nbsp; Jessica smiled again and she went back to sleep.   Later, as he lay in bed alongside his wife, Walter listened to the song of the breeze dancing through the trees outside...he felt the call of the sky and the clouds and the golden moon.&nbsp; Walter Williams snuggled closer to his wife and he went to sleep dreaming of flying.&nbsp; Like Apollo.&nbsp; Like Superman.     ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd.&nbsp; All rights reserved.

						   Wandering the humid hall of the San Diego Convention Center (one wouldn't expect that such an expansive space would be humid when the air conditioning was on but the crush of bodies and electronic doo-dads conspired to make it just so) during the annual Comic Con today I was reminded about how much I enjoy the quirky habit of reading comic books.   The exhibit hall...the size of at least three city blocks...was filled to overflowing with comics and computer games and movie memorabilia and people...lots and lots of people.&nbsp; People buying and selling...people seeing and being seen...people, paid actors and ardent fans both, dressed in elaborate costumes wandering the hall and posing for photos.&nbsp; There were three people (including one woman) dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp's character from  Pirates of the Caribbean )...and lots and lots of people in  Star Wars  costumes.   At the DC comics booth, Wonder Woman and The Flash posed with fans (and reminded us once again that super-hero comics rarely look as impressive in real life as they do in the pages of a comic book.)&nbsp; And one actress was covered head to toe in white paint to portray the character "Lady Death" (a very pale woman who wears little more than a bikini and a cape.)&nbsp; And one intrepid band of fans made themselves over as Spider-Man, his enemies Dr. Octopus and the Green Goblin, and his curvaceous ally The Black Cat.   At my advanced age, I still love comics...and, bless 'em, I love the people who love comics enough to dress up in wondrously geeky costumes and strut their stuff on the floor of the biggest comic book convention in America.

						   Ah nature...such a compelling part of the great tapestry of the world.&nbsp;   Take the lilting music of the birds, for example.&nbsp; The carefree songs of birds conversing and celebrating the day in the expansive skies and &nbsp;from the rooftops and treetops (including the plum tree just outside my bedroom window) of the city...it's a wondrous, joyous celebration of life and a delightful soundtrack to our earthbound, workaday existence.   Unless...   Unless it's 5:30 in the morning and you're trying to steal another hour or so of precious sleep before shambling into a new day (and, not being a "morning person", it takes a strong cup of tea, a shower, and a hour or so to make the transition from grumpy bear to almost&nbsp;amenable human being)...then those chipper, pre-dawn bird songs are just an annoying cacophony that seems to cut through the thickest pillow and make a beeline to one's nerves.   Or maybe it's just me.

						   The priorities of local news producers are often...puzzling.&nbsp; Yesterday much airtime was given to the rumor...THE RUMOR...that Michael Jackson ("affectionately" nicknamed "Freakboy" by this writer) had "fathered" quadruplets with an actress without portfolio (she's supposedly registered with the Screen Actors Guild but has no reported credits.)   That any such children, if they did exist, would probably be the same kind of fair skinned, fair haired, blue eyed&nbsp;offspring as his other three children....the kind of offspring someone with Jackson's genes (unaffected by the late blooming skin bleaching/hair straightening/nose and lip thinning&nbsp;disease that he swears has done of most of the altering of his own appearance over the years) would be extremely unlikely to co-produce on such a regular basis...is really neither here nor there.&nbsp; If he wants to pretend these children (past, present, or&nbsp; future)&nbsp;are fruit of his loins...and if the mothers are okay with pretending likewise...there's not really much we can do about it.   (It does bring up the question of the color of the sky in Michael Jackson's world but that will undoubtedly remain one of life's unsolved mysteries so I shan't dwell on it.)   No, the real question is why is this RUMOR...since denied by MJ's camp (though, of course, they have&nbsp;a history of mendacity so that really doesn't mean as much as it might otherwise)...is worth so time and attention on newscasts.&nbsp; I guess it's because  Us Magazine  and the  National Enquirer  are such legitimate news sources and thus any story originating there cannot be ignored.&nbsp; Or perhaps they're just reflecting our celebrity obsessions back at us in an effort to garner every ratings point they can.&nbsp; Or maybe they're just lazy.

						   I don't think that Governor Schwarzenegger calling the state legislature "girly men" is really sexist or homophobic (some especially thin-skinned and/or opportunistically partisan Democrat even compared his use of the phrase to using the "n word" which is so far over the top that it isn't funny.) &nbsp;  &nbsp;  That said, it was moronic and counterproductive&nbsp;though...the Governor continues to try to govern by "clever" soundbite (and, of course, all of those soundbites come from either from his movies or from other things...like, in this case,&nbsp;the old&nbsp;Hans and Franz "Saturday Night Live" bits...related to his celebrity) as if getting an adoring audience to chuckle was an effective measure of leadership.  &nbsp;  It is not a surprise that, despite Arnold's naive promises to the contrary, the state budget is weeks overdue and both sides of the political divide are digging in their heels for a lingering, increasingly bitter struggle.&nbsp; That's business as usual.&nbsp; It's also not a surprise that the Governor instead of hunkering down in Sacramento and doing some serious negotiating has instead taken his act back out on the road.&nbsp; Arnold loves the roar and laughter of adoring crowds...the never-ending campaign where he gets to shake hands and bask in the glory and let the applause of the audience wash over him over and over again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The state is in the same unproductive, heavily mortgaged &nbsp;morass we would have been in had Gray Davis kept the job but, thanks to a&nbsp; multi-million dollar recall election,&nbsp;at least we've got an honest-to-goodness &nbsp;movie star in the state house.&nbsp; So I guess we got what we really wanted.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But...are we having fun yet?

						   When I was&nbsp;a boy, a friend of my mother's brought over a big box of super-hero comic books for my brother and I.&nbsp; My brother, two years younger than I, was casually interested (most kids couldn't resist the bright primary colors and the action of comics back then) but I was hooked.&nbsp; I still remember going through the slightly musty cardboard box (my mother's friend had found the comics in a used book store in, I believe, San Francisco) and being enthralled.  &nbsp;  I took an immediate liking to the glorious "80 Page Giants"...squarebound and full of wondrous tales from days gone by...though, of course, they were all new to me...that were published by DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications...not that that's really important here but just go with it...)&nbsp; Batman and Robin, Green Lantern, The Flash, the Justice League of America, the Legion of Super-Heroes (how cool was that? 25 kids...kids not much older than me at the time...with super-powers saving the universe on a regular basis), and, of course, Superman and his family of characters (you don't have to be a comic book fan to know Lois Lane, Supergirl, or Jimmy Olsen.)  &nbsp;  I was hooked and that particular addiction lingers...unabashedly...even to this day.&nbsp; I've always loved to read and comic books were just part of a ongoing series of things that caught my reader's eye, heart, and mind.&nbsp; Comics opened the door to exploring science fiction and Greek mythology (I still remember a big book of myths filled with wild and wonderful stories and drawings of the gods looking very much like...yes...super-heroes) and on to the myriad subjects and genre which vied for my reading time then and vie for it now (as the burgeoning stack of books on my nightstand surely attests to.) &nbsp;  Once a month my local UPS guys delivers a box full of new comics and I get lost...if not quite a child again something as close to that initial feeling of wonderment as I can manage in my cynical dotage.  &nbsp;  Come Friday I'll be returning to the San Diego Comic-Con, one of the largest of these affairs in the world (made moreso perhaps by the success of big budget movies...the studio folks up the road in L.A. come down to hawk their wares and be seen more and more), and mingling with others who understand the feeling, to one extent or another,&nbsp;of finding a little magic in a flimsy brightly colored pamphlets.&nbsp; I haven't been to the Con in years (not since I ended my nearly decade long adventure in comic book retailing...a story for another day) and I'm looking forward to the sheer manic, gaudy, senses shattering (thanks, Stan :-) energy of the place.&nbsp; It will be cool...for a day anyway&nbsp;(one gets to a point, or&nbsp;more precisely an age,&nbsp;where you only take so many fanatics, salesmen, too-cool-for-the-room artists, and funky costumes on grownups who should have known better.)  &nbsp;  Excelsior, true believers :-)

						   From time to time, ideas come to me...lines, snippets of dialogue, even whole scenes...that have nothing to do with whatever I'm working on at the time. Sometimes these random writings are incorporated into full-blown pieces...and sometimes they remain as orphans, tantalizing teasers from the fickle muse that have no home.This then is one of the orphans which has been languishing in a file since it was born.&nbsp;&nbsp; This one was an early draft of the beginning of a story that would, in another form, come to be called "The Blue Room".  &nbsp;  ******  &nbsp;  "Good night, Mr. Worthington," they chorused with varying degrees of sincerity&nbsp;as their employer strode down the hall towards the executive elevator.  &nbsp;  John Worthington, his gray hair neatly combed, his expensive three-piece suit still meticulous despite a long, productive day holding court in the law firm that bore his name, felt no need to respond with more than the vaguest of nods. They were, after all, less than sheep, they were just his employees and the fear they felt in his presence pleased him no end. For all of his 55 years, he's made the world bend to his will and he accepted their trepidation as a sign that this state of affairs continued as indeed&nbsp;it should.   Within a few moments, he was behind the wheel of his Mercedes and roaring down the road. With nothing a big empty house waiting him, he felt no need to rush home. He turned towards downtown and all the posh, expensive, comfortable places&nbsp;he liked so much to unwind in after a long day's work.  &nbsp;  Worthington cruised down the boulevard for a while but there was nothing&nbsp; that caught his fancy enough to stop. He made a turn down an unfamiliar side street and found himself passing a dark, quiet bar..."The Blue Room", as its discreet azure neon sign identified it...he had never noticed before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something about the nondescript building&nbsp; intrigued him.  &nbsp;  He circled the block and pulled into the driveway next to the bar and back to the parking lot behind it.  As he stepped out of his car, a tall muscular blond, his movements fluid and graceful underneath his tuxedo, appeared in the back entrance.  &nbsp;  Worthington strode over the door. "Is this a public establishment?" he asked coolly.  &nbsp;  "Yes, sir," the doorman replied, his gaze lingering only briefly on Worthington's impassive face before he opened wide the door and stood aside. "Welcome to the Blue Room, sir."  &nbsp;  ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd. All rights reserved.

						   Last night my ever flowing dreams included an episode set on the starship Enterprise.&nbsp; I'm not really sure what that was about but as a general rule I try not to overthink my dreams (those which linger&nbsp;vividly into my waking hours...I'm sure much goes on in my dreaming that I am consciously unaware of and, given the sometimes offbeat state of my psyche, that's probably, as dear Miss Martha...style maven, convicted felon, and future jailbird...&nbsp;would say, a good thing.)  &nbsp;  The Enterprise of my dreaming state was, of course, the Enterprise of  Star Trek: The Next Generation ...the best of the various&nbsp; Star Trek  series (this coming from someone who loved the original series when it was first broadcast and who still holds a undiminished fondness for Kirk, Spock, Uhura, and the rest of that gang...still opinions will differ on which series was best...you mileage may vary but this is my blog so here  ST:NG  rules :-)&nbsp; I'm not sure what I was doing but I seemed to be in some kind of life or death struggle (which, of course, is the only kind of struggle they have on Star Trek) and Geordi and Riker and my main man Worf and the ever delightful Counselor Troi were all there (one wonders where Captain Picard had gotten off to but I'm sure he was off doing something suitably heroic.)  &nbsp;  I'm sure that having a dream about being part of something...whatever it was...that is probably saving the Universe (or the Federation or some obscure faraway planet where everyone speaks English and breathes Earth-like air or whatever the heck it was) has some kind of deep psychological meaning...but, as I said before, I try not to overthink these things so I won't be pondering them.  &nbsp;  I'll just contentedly live with the feeling&nbsp;of how cool it was to be on the Enterprise going boldly where no one has gone before and doing the heroic things that people on the Enterprise always do.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's good enough for me on a lazy Sunday morning.

						   The Vice President is not a fool.&nbsp; That said, one has to wonder why his behavior has become increasingly polarizing and&nbsp; downright belligerent as the campaign grinds on.&nbsp; Granted, the role of the Vice President (or Vice Presidential candidate) is said to be that of the "attack dog"...to say things the guy at the top of the ticket can't...or more often, won't...say to keep the partisan base fired up and happy...but Mr. Cheney seems to relish this role more than most.  &nbsp;  Perhaps he feels free because he's got nothing to lose.&nbsp; Win or lose this fall, he is extremely unlikely to vie for the Oval Office in the future (someone with his health history who have a hard time convincing even staunch supporters that he would be up for the stresses of the top job...the Presidency visibly ages healthy men, people with multiple heart episodes who any sense of self-preservation probably should not apply.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Freed from having to be elected to anything perhaps the Vice President feels free to be "himself".&nbsp; And that would be fine...except the real Dick seems to be smug,&nbsp;crotchety, foul-mouthed, thin-skinned,&nbsp; and arrogantly intransigent (any lack of evidence notwithstanding, for example, he keeps hammering at a close relationship between Hussein and bin Laden as if we're just supposed to accept it as gospel just because he says it's true)...just the kind of fine fellow we want a heartbeat away from the most powerful political job in the world.  &nbsp;  The Vice President is not a fool.&nbsp; And so maybe this whole super partisan thing is part of a carefully orchestrated strategy...Cheney secures the hard core believers while the President reaches out to the middle with his brand of "compassionate conservatism"...and maybe it will work in the long run.&nbsp; But it certainly isn't a pleasant thing to watch in the meantime.

						   So I'm watching the C-list celebrity talking heads on VH1 snark their way through 1994 ( Forrest Gump , O.J.'s "slow speed chase",  Melrose Place , Ace of Base, etc.) on "I Love the 90's" and suddenly I'm feeling very old and a little disoriented (though maybe the latter state is a function of the first...) Perhaps it's a function of our collective attention span becoming shorter and shorter but doesn't it feel like our history is being put through the trivia mill at an alarmingly rapid pace?   Once upon a time, it took decades for history...even pop culture history...to settle comfortably into the realm of regurgitate-able nostalgia. But now we're fondly remembering...with misty eyes, nods of affirmation, and knowing chuckles...things that happened just a few years ago. This trend is mocked...mostly by the same aforementioned talking heads...on VH1 (a channel which used to have something to do with music at one point but mostly seems to have gotten over that phase of its broadcasting existence) on "Best Week Ever", a sometimes clever weekly half-hour that celebrates the pop culture "highlights" of the week just passed.   Ah maybe I'm just a humorless curmudgeon (you don't have to nod so enthusiastically at that, pal)...but I'd really be more comfortable if we start waxing nostalgic by things that happened at least...AT LEAST...before my granddaughter...rounding the corner towards 4...was born. And even more comfortable if we pushed that timeline back to when my kids were kids.   It's just a thought...

						   Last fall's firestorm...the rampaging wildfires that charred thousands of acres and leveled dozens of homes...flirted with the area of town that I live in but never really posed a serious threat. And still, the ominous expanse of black and brown smoke...intertwined with clouds in an languid, awful dance high above our heads for such a long time last autumn...lingers in my memory as if the threat had been aimed at me.   In short, I took it personally.   Yesterday, someone tried to recreate the experience by setting part of eastern San Diego ablaze with fireworks (deliberately set) and, one presumes, sitting back...from a distance, with play by play provided by Marty Levin and Michael Tuck and the other local TV news people...and watching their baby consume a few thousand more acres...watching their creation put to peril the lives of those tasked with fighting such monsters...watching their creature put to panic people caught in its marauding path.   Despite the hot dry July winds, the brave souls who stand between us and infernos have beaten down this blaze...it will not, it seems, go unchecked for days upon days this time...and those who set off their bottle rockets and then zoomed off laughing giddily as the dry brush flared into bright tongues of fire are doubtlessly disappointed that what they've done will be contained and controlled as quickly as it will be.   All praise to the firefighters for their bravery and willingness to put themselves on the line for all of us.   I take that personally as well.

						   I'm not a lifelong football fan.  But I've loved the game for a long, long time. I didn't really get into the game until late in high school.  A couple of seasons working in the Los Angeles Coliseum as an usher (and having access to unoccupied box seats when we weren't working) was the foundation of my appreciation of the brutal, undeniably masculine grace of the game.  Watching the Los Angeles Rams, USC Trojans, and UCLA Bruins (all of whom played their home games in the venerable old stadium) play while my cousin Vernon patiently answered my incessant questions about the nuances of the game started something that has stayed with me, to one extent or another, ever since.  Understanding the coltish, intoxicating energy of the college game (the games that generated the most energy while I was working were the grand College rivalry games...USC vs. UCLA, Notre Dame vs. USC), I still ended up giving my first affection to the professional game.  Loyalty given to the Rams, my hometown team at the time, and, then as now, to the Oakland Raiders.  The Rams forfeited my loyalty by moving back to the Midwest...and, to be honest, by being heartbreakers who faltered (too often at the hands of the hated Dallas Cowboys) when they should have soared...but, through thick and thin, my gruff affection (it's really love but one avoids using such a "soft" word in this he-man context...it's a guy thing, just go with it) for the Raiders never waned.  Even when I moved here...to San Diego...to a city where, among football fans, hating the Raiders is almost a religion.  I've lived in San Diego for more than 20 years now...I love this town...but I have never really taken the San Diego Chargers to my heart.  It's not because they lose more often than they win...that has been true of my Raiders for the past 20+ years as well and my loyalty to them hasn't faded...it's just because they have never done anything to touch off any kind of spark in my fan's heart.     The past few years haven't done anything to make me regret my loyalty to Oakland's Silver and Black marauders.  Besides fielding mediocre teams, the Chargers have been soaking the citizens of our fair city with a cleverly-negotiated contract that guaranteed them sellouts by forcing the city to buy enough tickets to lift any potential television blackouts of home games.  Given the quality of the game they played, sellouts were few and far between (and more often than not, those sellouts involved the Raiders whose rabid fans filled the "Q"...Qualcomm Stadium...with so many black and silver jerseys that it looked like Oakland home games had been relocated south) and the city...and by extension, the city's taxpayers...paid hundreds of thousands of dollars buying unsold seats to bad football games.  And then, they decided that they wanted to take their shabby show on the road to a new city, a better deal (Los Angeles...pro football deficient major media market that it is...seemed enticing)...IF we didn't build them a brand new "football only" stadium (having watched the San Diego Padres get a taxpayer supported ballpark, I guess they felt left out.) Accusations (city government vs. Chargers ownership) flew...lawsuits flew just behind them...and we, the good citizens of "America's finest city", were caught in the middle of a silly struggle.  But now, a new deal has apparently been struck. Everybody (by which I mean the mayor, the Chargers management, most of the City Council) says it's a "win-win" situation though their words ring hollow and their manner suggests that it may be more akin to a "lose-lose" situation.  The ticket guarantee is gone.  The Chargers are here to stay for at least a few more years (the city's voters get to decide on a new stadium; the Chargers get to vote with their feet in a few years if the voters say no.)    And television blackouts of home games will again be a regular fixture of the San Diego football season.    Except when the Raiders come to town.

Sometimes these random writings are incorporated into full-blown pieces...and sometimes they remain as orphans, tantalizing teasers from the fickle muse that have no home.  This then is one of the orphans which has been languishing in a file since it was born.  This one is the opening of a story that was going to be(or perhaps still will be) called  Opaque .  *****  My name is Harrison Browne.  I am almost 50 years old and almost 25 years married.  I am the father of four and the grandfather of three.  My parents are still alive but my only sister is not.  I have a number of acquaintances and a small handful of people I consider friends.  I have a job I don’t like but am very good at nevertheless and I have dreams that I have long since learned to completely ignore.  My name is Harrison Browne.  And I am an opaque man.  I say this without rancor…well, at least without much rancor…or recrimination.  It is, quite simply, a proven fact.  I am here…fat, black, and occasionally happy…in the world and yet the world, and almost all of those residing (in times gone and times to be) in it, seems completely oblivious to who I really am.  This is, obviously, a happenstance of my own doing.  Though, for the life of me, I don’t completely understand why or how.  I see people around me with relative clarity…at least so they tell me…and find it strange that they cannot…or will not…see me with anything even remotely close to the same measure of clarity.  It is a paradox I find most passing strange…and disheartening.  People project, as is our habit, their images onto my reality and imagine that what they’ve chosen to see is what there is.  Inevitably they react…with disappointment, puzzlement, even sadness and anger…when their image and my reality come into conflict (as they are inevitably destined to do.)  I seem to leave rage and recrimination, heartbreak and heartache, disappointment and disillusionment in my wake when all I thought I was doing was living my life as well as I could.  ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd.

						   I'm not the kind of guy who falls in love with famous people (my longstanding infatuation with Linda Ronstadt notwithstanding)...I'm just not that guy.    But if I were that guy...if I were...I would be in love with Cassandra Wilson.  I wouldn't be in love with Cassandra because she's beautiful (though indeed she is that) and not even because she's a smart and daring artist (though she is that as well)...no, I would be in love with Cassandra Wilson because everytime she opens her honeyed, soft brown lips to sing, light and magic and wonder fill every fiber of my jaded being.  Jazz? Pop? R&B?  Yeah, she embodies all of that...and, in the same instant, she will not be hamstrung by any of it.  My Cassandra (if I were in love with her, she would be "my" Cassandra) would never allow herself to be hemmed in by arbitrary boundaries.  Just call what she does music...sweet, sensual, soul-arousing, bittersweet, Heaven-sent magic given form, nuance, rhythm, and melody...and you'll be in the neighborhood you need to be in to find her...to embrace and appreciate her.  Her husky, knowing, amazingly supple and wondrous voice finds wisdom, knowledge, and a world of experience, good and bad and in-between, in the hidden recesses of lyrics...her own and those of a who's who of songcraft (Dylan, Miles, Billie, Joni, U2, Hank Williams, Van Morrison)...and brings them to new, startling, utterly satisfying light for all to see and luxuriate in.  I'm not the kind of guy who falls in love with famous people.  I'm not that guy.  And so, of course, I'm not in love with Cassandra Wilson.  And I plan to...not...be in love with Cassandra for many, many years to come.  *****  recommended listening:   Blue Light 'til Dawn  (1993) featuring a stately, revelatory version of Van Morrison's "Tupelo Honey" (with a dash of Jimi Hendrix's "Angel" thrown in for good measure) and a stark, haunting take on Robert Johnson's "Hellhound on my Trail" along with the sultry, self-penned title song.   New Moon Daughter  (1995) finding common ground and new nuance between diverse sources such as U2 ("Love is Blindness"), Hank Williams ("I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"), Neil Young ("Harvest Moon"), Hoagy Carmichael ("Skylark") and even The Monkees (a jaunty, soulful "Last Train to Clarksville") along with originals (the slyly sensual "A Little Warm Death" and the wistful "Solomon Sang").   Traveling Miles  (1999) the spirit of Miles Davis revisited, reinterpreted, and joyfully celebrated with originals, songs once covered by Miles (Cyndi Lauper's "True Colors"), and Miles classics with new lyrics by Cassandra   Belly of the Sun  (2002) more compelling originals interwoven with smart, sometimes unexpected covers (Dylan's stately "Shelter from the Storm", Robbie Robertson's "The Weight", James Taylor's "Only a Dream in Rio", and even Jimmy Webb's "Wichita Lineman")   Glamoured  (2003) another compelling, surprising collection features her songwriting collabrations mixed to wonderful effect with tunes like Sting's "Fragile", Dylan's "Lay Lady Lay", Muddy Waters' "Honey Bee", and Willie Nelson's immortal "Crazy"

						   It has been suggested to me (hi, Pamela! :-) that calling Ralph Nader's Presidential campaign "pointless" wasn't exactly fair.  And, upon reflection, I agree that indeed it wasn't.  The guy KNOWS he isn't going to win but he's exercising his right (and duty?) to use the campaign to passionately advocate causes he believes in...causes neither of the mostly interchangeable "major" parties care even a whit about...and that is, when you think about it, probably the most patriotic thing that ANY of the candidates (with all of their blathering about their war histories and religious beliefs and whatnot) will ever do.    If the stranglehold on American politics that the Democrats and Republicans have is ever going to be broken it has to start somewhere.    Ross Perot was too egocentric to continue what he started with the Reform Party so Ralph Nader has stepped into the thankless breach as a Don Quixote for what's left of the political aspect of the American dream.  Godspeed, soldier, give 'em hell.

The old man’s courtly manner, masculine and awkward, touched Kathy in ways that she was at a loss to even try to explain in the limited universe of spoken words.  Joshua was a graceful bear of man, tall and burly, hirsute and stoic, who was comfortable with the years that he spent on Earth.  Sixty-two summers ain’t that many, he would say with soft conviction.  Coyness not being a companion of his, he meant that totally without irony.  He had made more than his share of mistakes…what man who was truly living could say that he had not?…but he learned from the ones he could and made his peace with the ones he could not and lived his life as the best man he could be.    Kathy was enormously charmed and the gulf of years between her age and his faded into meaninglessness without her consciously realizing it.  ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd.

						   Have you ever had that dream where you're standing in line in a busy supermarket waiting to buy milk and you're naked and nobody else is but nobody seems to notice?  And then when you get to the front of the line it turns out you don't have enough money for a gallon of milk so the cashier takes what money you have and then opens the milk and pours some into your hands?  And then you rush home cupping the milk in your hands and running as fast as you can because the milk is freezing cold but you don't want to spill it because if you do then you'll have to eat your Cap'n Crunch dry and dry Cap'n Crunch is just about the worst thing to eat ever?  And then you get home and get into the house but then you trip over your pet armadillo and spill the freezing cold milk all over the floor and then the armadillo licks up all of the milk and then thanks you for the refreshing drink?  And then you slink into the kitchen where naked people who look just like James Earl Jones and Dolly Parton are waiting to force feed you dry Cap'n Crunch until you burst?  Have you ever had that dream?  No?  Yeah...um...me neither...

						   It is mildly surprising that John Kerry chose John Edwards to be his running mate.  It seemed a slightly more likely (and indeed safer) choice would have been Washington "insider" Dick Gephardt (for his "gravitas" and familiarity with the ins and outs of DC politics as well as his ties to big Labor, a fading but still potent part of the Democratic equation.)    But, that said, the colorless Kerry probably chose the energetic Edwards as a way of giving the ticket some "zing", hoping that Edwards will stir up the kind of enthusiastic passion that Democrats are always hungering after (and that they had in a certain current bestselling author....whatever else you can say about Bill Clinton you can never call him colorless...or, for better or for worse, passionless.)  Edwards, though, seems more like Dan Quayle than Bill Clinton, enthusiastic but wet behind the ears and just one gaffe away from becoming a perpetual punchline on late night talk shows (one can easily imagine that Jon Stewart and David Letterman are already poised to pounce often and hard.)  Bush and his pompously pugnacious attack dog Cheney.   Kerry and his giddy "young" protege Edwards.   Nader and that guy he picked to run his pointless race with him.    These are our choices and I feel like Richard Pryor in "Brewster's Millions" wanting desperately to vote for "None of the Above".  But I won't.  I will hold my nose and pick one (not voting would only make me part of the problem...and, just as importantly, being an active voter is my ticket to being able to rant as much as I wish :-)

She asked the question in a soft, dispassionate voice that made it clear that the answer was of no real consequence to her.  "Every other man around here has."  	"I'm afraid of you," I responded truthfully.  	Her eyebrow shifted upward and she looked at me directly for the first time since I sat down.  "Afraid of me?" she said, vaguely intrigued.  	"Afraid of your sadness," I said correcting myself.  "You live in a deep well of sadness," I said, consciously purging any traces of pity from my voice, "and you don't make any effort to climb out it."  	She nodded slowly with neither sadness nor irony.  "How presumptuous of you," she responded, though she was neither offended nor angered.  	"Perhaps," I agreed, though my footing was solid.  "But not incorrect."  	She almost smiled.  "No," she said with no regret, "not incorrect."  	She shook a cigarette from the pack on the table and lit it with the blue plastic lighter she had tucked into the pack's cellophane outer wrapper.  Deftly lighting the cigarette, she looked up and away from me and allowed a thick, acrid mist to sigh from her lips.  	I ate my sandwich and waited.  Though the conversation seemed over I knew that it was not.  	"So why aren't you trying to save me?" she asked, luxuriating in the wispy texture of the cloud of smoke in her mouth before allowing it to escape and join with the rest floating just above our heads.  	"Excuse me?" I said though I had clearly heard and understood what she had said.  	She snorted a half-sigh through her nose, clearly recognizing the feint, and repeated the question.  "Why aren't you trying to save me?" she said, a bit of an edge gleaming along the outline of her words.  "You say see me down this well...this well of sadness as you call it...and yet you're not trying to save me.  Why not?"  	I looked at her face but she did not look back at me.  "I'm not a hero."  	That caught her off guard and she turned her full attention towards me.  "Excuse me?" She said though I knew that she had clearly heard and understood what I had said.  	"I'm not a hero," I repeated evenly, putting my sandwich down on the waxed paper that had once covered it.  "I'm doing all that I can to keep myself upright and I very much doubt that I would have the strength to dive into your well and pull us both out."  	She put her cigarette back up to her lips and took a long drag, her eyes boring into mine.  She tilted her head up and away from me and blew the smoke out with enough force to scatter the cloud that gathered above.  "Hmph," she said, "an honest man.  How...unexpected."  	It was neither a compliment nor a condemnation.  I picked up my sandwich and resumed eating.   ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd.  All rights reserved.

						   After living in San Diego for almost 22 years, I finally found my way to the annual San Diego County Fair this past Saturday.  Interesting experience.  The fair was filled with people wandering in every direction at once (no matter how large the space, people will find creative ways to get into each other's ways) and the pungent aroma of foods of all kinds (one stand proudly proclaiming itself "the home of the deep-fried Snickers bar", a dubious distinction insofar as I'm concerned.)  And stuff...clothes and candy and gemstones: gadgets, widgets, and doo-dads...filling barn-sized buildings.  And, again, the people...Moms and dads and kids of all ages, salesmen and schoolgirls, bikers and businessmen, and lesbians by twos and threes and fours come to see Melissa Etheridge play an afternoon concert in a space that will give way to thoroughbred horse racing later this month.  People eating the aforementioned food and buying the aforementioned merchandise; people enjoying rides on the midway and getting vicarious thrills watching the bungee jumpers hanging underneath a crane topped with a ragged American flag.  A warm (but not too warm) July day in Del Mar ("where the turf meets the surf") taking in the Fair.  A good way to pass a few summer's hours.  Quote of the day (seen on a t-shirt in a vendor's window at the Fair): "Any man can be a Grandfather but it takes a special guy to be a PAPA".  I like that (he says, smiling wistfully at a photo of his granddaughter.)

						   Try watching the diving and, most especially, the gymnastic events with the sound muted. Your enjoyment of the pure physical artistry of these events will be GREATLY improved when you're not subjected to the constant blathering of the "expert" commentators (who either are being paid by the word...or, more likely, just don't know when to shut the hell up and let the athletes' performances speak for themselves.)

						   I wasn't feeling the opening ceremonies of the Olympics ("wasn't feeling"...man, I'm so hip sometimes :-) so I spent the time watching some of the counter programming. The American Film Institute counted down the 100 best songs from the movies. The list was, of course, flawed and highly debatable...but that was kind of the point. Take any 100 people and ask them to come up with such a list and you would get 100 completely different countdowns.   (And being the AMERICAN Film Institute, they only counted American made movies...which left great movie songs like  "A Hard Day's Night ",  "Help!",  and  "Alfie"  out in the cold.)  AFI's top 3 were:    "Over the Rainbow " from   The Wizard of Oz   " As Time Goes By " from   Casablanca   and " Singin' in the Rain " from the movie of the same name.   Not bad choices. Watching the clips from the various movies was fun and while I was not in agreement with much of it..." Theme from Shaft " (#38)was ranked too low,  "Stayin' Alive " (#9) and the insipid  "My Heart Will Go On " (#14) were ranked too high, and  "Flashdance...What a Feeling " (#55) probably shouldn't have been ranked at all.   Interesting that so many songs on the list were sung by Fred Astaire and Liza Minnelli. And cool that Public Enemy (the incendiary and amazing  "Fight the Power"  at #40) and Eminem (the Oscar-winning  "Lose Yourself"  at #93) made the cut among so many former Broadway showtunes and movie love ballads.   Any list eclectic enough to feature performances by Barbra Streisand, Paul Robeson, Bob Hope, Kermit the Frog, Bob Seger, Steppenwolf, Judy Garland, and Marlon Brando (crooning  "Luck Be a Lady " from   Guys and Dolls  ) is alright with a fan of all kinds of music like myself.   (Still would it have killed them to give a little love to something from   Purple Rain  ?)

						   To the surprise of, I would hope, almost no one, the California Supreme Court has voided the nearly 4,000 same sex marriages that were sanctioned by the mayor of San Francisco back in February and March of this year. The wedding certificates that Rosie O'Donnell and her spouse and all of the other couples got are now interesting and provocative historical souvenirs but they hold absolutely no legal standing.  It was a noble gesture on the part of Mayor Gavin Newsom (not sure if he's savvy politician playing to the progressive hometown crowd or a true son of Don Quixote tilting against windmills despite the odds, but I guess it really doesn't matter)...but it was a gesture that was, of course, fated to come to this conclusion given the laws of the state...and the prevailing mood of much of the country.  I'm still failing to see how allowing same sex couples to marry will do irrevocable harm to the "institution of marriage"...we should be celebrating committed love between consenting adults not putting arbitrary roadblocks in its path...but this is an issue that reaches into the sanctimonious hearts of so many clutching their Bibles to their (sometimes truly pious and well-meaning, sometimes just plain intolerant) breasts and as such it will touch off vehement protest whenever it's even broached.  In the words of one of my heroines, Linda Ellerbee, and so it goes.

						   When I was a boy I wanted to be a Temptation. Back then the Temptations were, to my young mind, the coolest, most stylish, sexiest cats on the planet. They danced like they were floating on smooth gossamer wings and they sang like you hoped the angels in the heavens could sing.  As Nanci Griffith wrote, "I was a child of the 60's; when dreams could be had through T.V. With Disney and Cronkite and Martin Luther; and I believed...I believed...I believed..."  And I believed.  I believed in Bobby Kennedy and the Beatles; in Superman and  Star Trek  and Adam West as Batman; in giving peace a chance and that all you needed was love. I believed in my mother and my cousin Vernon and that my brother Guy wouldn't always be such a pain in my butt. I believed in the power of ideas and the power of music; I believed that your soul could be lifted and your life made brighter with the magic pouring through the speakers of a phonograph or an AM radio station.  When I was a boy, sometimes I wanted to be a Rolling Stone...or another Jackson brother...or a member of the Family Stone...or even a Monkee...but most times, in my child's heart of hearts, I wanted to belong on the streets of Motown, the breathing soul of young America...most times, I wanted to be a Temptation.  Most of the real Temptations have passed on now...but that sweet fire they stoked in me has never completely gone away. And I pray it never does.  I close my eyes as the bass line slides in, sweet and silky, and the music sweeps me in..." I've got sunshine on a cloudy day "...and, three glorious minutes at a time, everything is right with the world.  ***** recommended listening:  " My Girl: The Very Best of The Temptations " (2 magical discs of pure uptown, life affirming soul music)

						   I had a dream about love and justice last night. Quite literally about love and justice…or at least as literal as the dreaming mind deigns to be. There was a judge…a red-haired woman, I believe (details so sharp in the dreaming become hazy and impressionistic here in the waking)…who making crisp, firm decisions and brooking no complaints.  One by one, a long line of people stood before her bench. The judge scrutinized them and then, banging her gavel with a confident flourish, she sentenced them.  “I sentence you to love,” she told some sending them off to the right where they were met by smiling people…wives, husbands, lovers, children, parents, friends, it varied from person to person. Some of those sentenced to love seemed incredibly happy, others more dubious but resigned to their fates.  “I sentence you to justice,” she told others sending them off to the left where some were handcuffed and taken into custody by burly guards in crisp khaki uniforms and others were given money and car keys and allowed to leave, alone, through a door that opened onto a bustling city street. Some of those sentenced to justice seemed relieved, others apprehensive but resigned to their fates.  I’m not sure if my dreaming self was in line or just watching from the gallery (and, of course, I don’t waste time over-thinking these things…the dreaming mind is ever enigmatic and any meaning in dreams will make itself known if and when it chooses to.)

						   From time to time, ideas come to me...lines, snippets of dialogue, even whole scenes...that have nothing to do with whatever I'm working on at the time. Sometimes these random writings are incorporated into full-blown pieces...and sometimes they remain as orphans, tantalizing teasers from the fickle muse that have no home. This then is one of the orphans which has been languishing in a file since it was born. The following was once the prologue to a semi-autobiographical novel...with the working title of  Soul Deep ... I've started several times. It is not in the current draft but may be restored before all is said and done.  ******  My childhood was a series of shadows . . . shadows eluded, and shadows climbed into and embraced with all the strength one lonely little black boy could muster. Sometimes I thought the whole world was lost in shadows.  I used to imagine, in the way that only children can imagine, that the whole world revolved around me. Of course, I know all too well that it didn't . . . but that didn't stop me from wondering if (and indeed how) people moved and did things when I wasn't around to see them. Imagination was one thing I had in abundance.  Imagination . . . and memories.  One of my earliest memories is, almost as a matter of course, a painful one. It was a cold autumn morning; storm clouds were gathering ominously overhead. But I didn't care. My daddy was coming to spend the whole day with me. Only me. I was three.  I waited, bundled head to toe, at the gate in front of my mother's little house straining to catch a glimpse of his car coming up the quiet street. The icy breeze cut through me despite the coat and the scarf and the button-down cap Mama made me put on . . . but I didn't care.  Behind me in the doorway, my mother stood fuming silently. Her eyes were filled with hot, stinging tears that threatened to spill out every time I craned my neck at the sound of a car engine only to slump down dejectedly when it wasn't my daddy's car engine.  "Bastard," she hissed as she spun on her heels and stormed toward the telephone. She stopped herself and took a deep breath. She lit a cigarette and made a conscious effort to calm herself before she picked up the phone. My little sister Amanda was sleeping in her room, blissfully unaware of the drama playing out around her.  Mama drew the pungent smoke into her lungs and exhaled it slowly. She dialed the number she wanted and waited. It rang once . . . twice . . . thrice . . . twelve times in all. She dropped the receiver back onto its cradle. He wasn't home. And he wasn't, she was sure, on his way to pick up his son.  I stood at that gate for nearly an hour, crestfallen but hopeful just the same. I waited until the clouds finally opened and the rain began to fall. I turned, my face wet with both raindrops and my own quiet tears, walked back up the walk and up the stairs into the house.  Mama took my coat and scarf and cap and hugged me for what seemed like a million years. She said something about daddy . . . but I don't remember what it was. Amanda started to cry and Mama went to see to her. I went into my bedroom and flopped down onto the bed.  Daddy showed up two days later. He had forgotten. "Sorry 'bout that, boy," he said in that happy-go-lucky way of his.  He chucked my chin and smiled. "Think you can forgive the old man?" he said flashing his most disarming grin.  I nodded. I forgave him. But I never forgot the lesson he taught me on that cold, autumn morning.   ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd. All rights reserved.

						   I've been a big fan of Bruce Springsteen since 1977...the year the amazing  "Darkness on the Edge of Town"  album came out (the hype of '75...when  "Born to Run"  came out and Bruce was declared "the future of rock and roll"...hit right at the heart of my skeptical cynicism over the media trying to define what is cool for the rest of us and I shied away.) I haven't looked back (and yes, I came to embrace "Born to Run" and the albums that came before it.)  From then to now, I have been (and will remain) firmly in Bruce's army of loyal fans. That said, I wouldn't go cast my Presidential vote just because he told me to.  I will, of course, cast my vote because I think it's the price we should willingly and happily pay for our democracy...and the price we should willingly and eagerly pay for our right to bitch about the state of things. My one vote may not mean much in the grand scheme of things but it means a whole lot to me and I have cast it in nearly every election I've been eligible to participate in (in Presidential elections my personal record for voting on the winning side is 4-3 since my first vote in '76.)  Bruce Springsteen and a host of other pop stars...including John Fogerty, REM, Bonnie Raitt, John Mellencamp, The Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam, and the Dixie Chicks...are going to "battleground states" (Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and, of course, Florida) to do multiple concerts on what's being called the "Vote for Change" tour.  The tour...sponsored by MoveOn.org...is supposed to encourage apathetic voters who might otherwise sit on their hands to get out on Election Day and vote. They don't seem to be FOR Senator Kerry as much as they are AGAINST President Bush but more power to them for putting their time and energy towards what they believe in...more power to them for trying to make a difference.  Will it work? I don't know. Most fans who go to shows will be there because they want to rock not because they're fired up to become a participating part of the political process. But if it gets even just a few more non-voters...of whatever age...to step up to the plate on November 2nd then it's all good (and if Toby Keith, Kid Rock, and Jessica Simpson want to organize a similar pro-Bush tour more power to them as well...it's a free country and the more voices being heard the stronger our democracy becomes and remains.)  ****** Recommended listening:  Bruce Springsteen:  Born to Run   Darkness on the Edge of Town   The River   Nebraska   Born in the U.S.A.   Live/1975-1985   Tunnel of Love   Tracks   The Rising

						   The good people of the state of Missouri (or at least a plurality of the people who chose to vote in Tuesday's election) have decided to put an amendment in their state constitution to "protect marriage" by defining it as a union between a man and a woman.  At the same time, a judge in Seattle ruled that Washington's ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional.  Both of the major Presidential candidates are against gay marriage (though Kerry, somewhat reluctantly, endorses the concept of gay civil unions.)  And the possibility of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution defining marriage as a union between a man and woman continues to be bandied about.  And I have to wonder why so many people are so threatened by the possibility of gay couples getting married. Why would what other people do in their lives and relationships have any impact on their own lives and relationships?  "The sanctity of marriage"? A good number of heterosexual marriages are undermined by abuse and infidelity and half of them end in divorce. Marriage has thrived in the face of these challenges and one has to believe that it will continue to do so even if same sex couples are allowed the right to legally walk down the aisle.  "Stability for the children"? Again, half of marriages dissolve in divorce (sometimes acrimoniously, sometimes not) and a large percentage of children grow up in "broken" homes or blended families (myself, I grew up in a single parent home...hi, Mom!...and I turned out reasonably well...if I do say so myself.)  "The Bible says..."? The Bible also says that death (by stoning no less) is the penalty for adultery...it's easy to tapdance through the scriptures and make a case for anything you want. Using God to justify your own prejudices is, at best, disingenuous...and, at worst, baldly hypocritical and cynically manipulative.  Civilization won't grind to a halt if Martin and George...or Joanna and Karen...are allowed to legally wed and live happily ever after (or at least as happily ever after as any of us can.) If people of sound mind and caring heart want to share their lives with all of the benefits and sanctions of the law more power to them (this old world of ours could use more celebrations of love and life.)  We really should let that whole argument go so that we can once again turn our collective attention back to things which are  really  important to our society.  Like being outraged and/or...ahem...titillated by Janet Jackson's naked nipple.

						   Tom Ridge, the head of the Department of Homeland Security (who apparently will be leaving his job after the election because he can't afford to send his kids to college on his $175,000 salary), said today that a lot of the information that raised the terror alert levels on east coast buildings, led officials all over the country to ramp up security even at sites not mentioned in the information, and kept the media from sea to shining sea abuzz with feverish speculation dates back to the years 2000 and 2001. But, he continues to insist, "it was essential" to release it to the public and raise the alert level to "orange" for specific sites.  Okey-doke.  That these kinds of terror plans are long-term affairs is a given and only the most cynical amongst us would question the timing of portentous pronouncements from the White House's stalwart Homeland Security guy (who says that he and his department are apolitical when it comes to the job they have to do. And that is, of course, good to know.)  Only the most cynical amongst us would accuse Mr. Ridge and the administration of covering their asses so that when and if (more likely "when" than "if" given our open society and our busy, complicated lives which leaves us little time or interest to be look around every corner for terrorists) something happens they can...and indeed will... say that they warned us all along  ("see...we told you that SOMETHING would happen in SOME WAY on SOMEDAY at SOME PLACE...we really called that one, didn't we? Maybe next time you'll listen to us!")   Indeed, only the most cynical amongst us would point out that the administration speaks of the terrorists as having being dealt major, debilitating, demoralizing setbacks when they want to show how they're winning the "war on terror" but, at the same time, that they also say that the network(s) of terrorists are apparently still organized, disciplined, and funded well enough to pose major threats to the homeland (a fact which often, coincidentally I'm sure, goes onto the front burner when the administration might want to change the story being spotlighted by the news media...say, just for example, the story of the Democratic challengers hitting the road after their mostly harmonious convention.)  *****  It is, changing the subject somewhat, good to hear that the Statue of Liberty, refitted with new safety features and restrictions, is reopened to the public for the first time since 2001. The great lady is too important a symbol of this country to be forever closed to the people out of fear.

						    The rhythm of the rain on my truck’s windshield is too insistent to completely ignore. But I try to do so anyway. It’s going to be a long night and I can’t be bothered to think about anything other than the end of my journey. I’ve just enough coffee and cigars to keep me awake. I’ve got Garth and Willie and Loretta on the stereo to keep me company. I’m on the road to California, praying that that woman will still be longing for me after all of the time I’ve willfully let pass.  The road is glistening with moonlight and autumn rain and the reflections of other amber headlights zooming by at 75 miles an hour. My road is clear, paved with hope and regret and rediscovered love and passion; my road leads to an altar of love I’m willing and able to prostrate myself upon unabashedly. I’m on the road to California, praying that that woman’s eyes…bright and beautiful and easy to drown in…will still shine the way they only used to shine for me.  The night is dark and shrouded with uncaring clouds dancing their part in a fierce song cycle of life. My heart is gray and shrouded with the realization that most probably I’m far, far too late. But I don’t care. I’ve got to try anyway. I’ve got just enough hot coffee and pungent cigars to keep me focused. I’ve got Hank and Patsy and Emmylou to sing the words my inarticulate heart could never give voice to. I’m on the road to California, praying that that woman’s heart…big and bountiful and almost too tender to hold…hasn’t closed itself to me forever.  The shout of the thunder and the whip crack of the lightning are not enough to give me the slightest instant of pause. I’m on my way to salvation…on my way to forgiveness…on my way to the only arms that can give me welcoming shelter from the ongoing storms of life and love and bittersweet lust. I’m on the road to California…driving hard through the driving rain…praying that that woman will be waiting for me after all the time I’ve foolishly thrown away.                                        ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd.

						   From time to time, ideas come to me...lines, snippets of dialogue, even whole scenes...that have nothing to do with whatever I'm working on at the time. Sometimes these random writings are incorporated into full-blown pieces...and sometimes they remain as orphans, tantalizing teasers from the fickle muse that have no home. This then is one of the orphans which has been languishing in a file since it was born. This was the first draft of the opening scene of a story that eventually came to be called "First Day". The story was completed but the opening scene was completely rewritten for its final draft. This, the original opening, has languished in limbo ever since.  ******  She shut off the engine of her car and sat looking, with both trepidation and unabashed joy, at the house . . . at his house. His directions had been perfect and she knew that this was indeed the place where her journey ended. She swallowed hard and glanced at the clock on the dashboard . . . she was on time . . . a few minutes early in fact . . . and she lingered, trying to allow her heart time to slow its beating to a calmer pace.  She laughed nervously at herself, realizing that that was not going to happen. She took hold of her purse and opened the door and stepped out.  They had talked about this day for weeks . . . planned for it . . . made time for it . . . found its nuances haunting their dreams and coloring their workaday worlds...and now it was here and she felt as nervous as a new bride.  She chuckled again, realizing that the analogy wasn't too far off the mark.  The area was quiet and still...the stately houses set close enough to give the feel of a neighborhood, far enough to keep everyone's boundaries inviolate; vague whispers of coffee and chlorine and roses and wood smoke giving weight to the clear morning air; the idle song of a satisfied bird soothing from somewhere near. She locked the car door and went and opened the trunk. She struggled to get her suitcase out and slammed it shut, the sound echoing lazily through the stillness.  She put her keys into her purse and shut it tight and put it over her shoulder. She walked the suitcase up the walkway to the front door. The house was sturdy and solid, all of its drapes drawn giving it a vaguely forbidding aspect. The lawn was neatly trimmed and a well-tended bed of rosebushes stretched from the front off to the right all the way to the fence line. Masculine...strong but not ostentatiously so... forbidding and welcoming in the same instant...much like the man himself, she thought with pride and love bubbling freely through her.  She put the suitcase down and fussed with her clothes. Then she rang the bell and picked up the suitcase and waited.  He took a deep breath and opened wide the great wooden door. She was waiting, her eyes bright with anxiety and anticipation, her lips dry, a suitcase clutched with both hands in front of her ample, womanly body and a large black pocketbook slung under her right arm. She was wearing a simple but elegant black skirt that clung to the sweet curve of her hips and a cool white blouse that fell in haphazard and alluring folds around her breasts and her belly.   ©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd.
