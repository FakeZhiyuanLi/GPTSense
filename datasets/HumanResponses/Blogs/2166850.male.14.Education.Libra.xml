         somehow after exams are over i don't feel good about bein' too relaxed...i think i need to be occupied with something all the time... bleh... maybe cuz my parents are SO bossy about everything...making me do something especially when i'm jus resting... maybe cuz i did so badly...???? i have no idea why i'm feeling this way... so highly-strung...gosh... i still have some exams and music classes to attend and study for...plus im not allowed to go out with my friends and stuff...my parents think its a total waste of my damn time...gosh...my life stinks yeah? oh well...i'll continue net-surfing...i cant be bothered to think of anything else...like exam scores....(ARGGHH!!!!)....it drives me mad...!@)0(@! well...til' next time...

      whew! i haven't been writing in for ages...but hey! im hapi 2dae....  i got admitted into acs(I)  which is in the top 10 schools in Singapore....actually i sat for another exam at dunman high, but i bet i didn't get in there cos i havent received any reply from them so far...anyway i dunt lyk DHS...so hu the heck cares? im hapi! thats all that matters! i never liked AHS in my whole sec 2 year...bleah...so i guess acs is the right place, except...im worried that i wont fit in like ahs, but i think i will leave that up to God, cos He solves my problems....GOD RULEZ! JESUS SAVES!  im gonna be joining the band and the swimming team...tough huh? and i will also have to stay at the boarding house for 1 year!! sounds tough...gosh! i wonder how i will be able to go for the tan kah kee interviews next year!!! i need God to help me again... anyway...hope i enjoy acs next year....and be able to cope with the studies... i also just finished attending my youth conference at my church group that i meet with a week ago. honestly, i felt that it was 1 of the most boring camps ever, but it was a last minute kind of thing so it was kind of rushed and stuff, so our serving ones were like, hectic....poor guys...but it was great fun.... so, hope to write back really soon....esp b4 going to the states fot the  winter training ...hey! thats fun!! cya...

The  nba  match was in this arena called  the pyramid ... and it was good...the  memphis grizzlies  against the  atlanta hawks ...at first the hawks were winning, but in the second-half there was a surprising turnaround of events...and the grizzlies won by  12  points!! amazing huh? my favs in grizzlies are  pau gasol  and shane *something*...b4 tt we ate at  spaghetti warehouse  which was excellent...i had  lasagne  and  angel hair pasta ...mmmm we also went to  graceland ...home of  elvis presley ... it was amazing, especially his jungle room...i hated elvis' hair in his later years though...uggh...but he's just such an amazing man... we also went to  stax museum of soul music ...which was in this run down neighbourhood...not bad i should say, but its a pity it closed down.... all that in  memphis  huh? believe it? i wanted to look for  justin timberlake 's house in memphis too, but i guess nobody was interested in it... we went to  ripley's beleive it or not  in  new orleans, louisiana , and my brothers and cousin esther freaked out!!! so i went in with titus instead...it was amazing....but a lot of gross stuff too... anyway, we're gg to a mall now and i need to print some boarding passes for our flight tml, so ciao! hope to c u b4 nx year...

      hi to everybody reading this blog!!! my fave song now is  alicia keys -- if i aint got you ...here are the lyrics:   Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power yeah Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things Define what's within I've been there before But that life's a bore So full of the superficial  Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you  Some people search for a fountain Promises forever young Some people need three dozen roses And that's the only way to prove you love them  And in a world on a silver platter And wondering what it means No one to share, no one who truly cares for me  Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you  Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you  If I ain't got you with me baby Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing If I ain't got you with me baby   if my blog is still playing  craig david 's song, then its not updated yet.... school is ok, for the first week of term 2....im juz feeling a bit out of knack for the moment, with a bad cough and a running nose....*sniffle* and caron, if u are reading this, i would like to know the details of your 'kaa holl etcetc.' youth outreach thing on april 9th coz my frenz arent sure if they can make it....email me k? and i need the name too.... any way, i'll be back with a new entry the next time....arrivederci....

       You Don't Miss Your Water (Til' The Well Runs Dry) --by  Craig David ... my favorite song for now...lyrics:   As I sail with you across the finest oceans On our way to find the key to our emotions Together we will move the clouds to brighter days Some people question what I say Try to break up you and me But I know this love between us is growing stronger You can call me whenever from wherever Just remember that I'll be there Through all the stormy weather Us break up never No we'll be together Forever  Chorus: You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry But I believe so strongly in you and I Can't somebody answer me the question why You don't miss your water til the well runs dry  As I close my eyes Sit back while reminiscing Of when we used to fuss and fight but end up kissing There may be sad and pain for time along the way But in my heart you'll always be everything and more to me For I know this love between us is growing stronger You can call me whenever from wherever Just remember that I'll be there Through all the stormy weather Us break up never No we'll be together Forever  Chorus  For you are always on my mind You are always on my mind Girl you know that you You are always  You are always on my mind You are always forever  Chorus  You don't miss your water girl no But I believe so strongly in you and I yeah Can somebody answer me the question why Cause you don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry yeah listen If you ever get the feeling You wanna play around starting cheating, remember You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry    for those of u who managed to figure out my nickname on msn messenger, then u should be able to get here...and congrats to you guys who have succeeded... everytime i post a message, my first line will be about my favourite song for then... so anyway...a big hi to all my pals in ahs...i heard u miss me lotzz...sori i cant visit u guyz just yet...ive been so busy recently...hope u understand...but now the hols are here so i guess its better now...but any way... email me if there's anything ok? im going to watch disney on ice--beauty and the besat on friday nite...hope it'll be good....anyway...gotta catchup on homework ...c u soon!

      the appropriate song for now would be  happy holiday  by  cheeky girls , but i think i'll stick to this song by  lene marlin -- unforgivable sinner  here are the lyrics:   Kinda lose your sense of time 'Cause the days don't matter no more All the feelings that you hide Gonna tear you up inside You hope she knows you tried  Follows you around all day And you wake up soaking wet 'Cause between this world and eternity There is a face you hope to see  You know where you've sent her You should know where you are You're trying to ease off But you know you won't get far And now she's up there Sings like an angel But you can't hear those words And now she's up there Sings like an angel Unforgivable Sinner  You've been walking around in tears No answers are there to get You won't ever be the same Someone cries and you're to blame  Struggling with a fight inside Sorrow you'll defeat The picture you see it won't disappear Not unpleasant dreams or her voice you hear  You know where you've sent her You should know where you are You're trying to ease off But you know you won't get far And now she's up there Sings like an angel But you can't hear those words And now she's up there Sings like an angel Unforgivable Sinner  Maybe one time lost But now you're found Stand right up before You hit the ground Maybe one time lost But now you're found Stand right up before You hit the ground - hit the ground  You know where you've sent her You should know where you are You're trying to ease off But you know you won't get far And now she's up there Sings like an angel But you can't hear those words And now she's up there Sings like an angel Unforgivable Sinner    i know the english is a bit funny, but her songs are all like that...but pay attention to the music...its one of those feel good guitar tracks...worth a listen! yes, and from the title, u would have guessed that the  starbucks  coupon i'm holding from the  8 days magazine is valid until 13 june...so i'm really happy abt it i swam 20 laps just now, so i hope to catch a good sleep for tomorrow's social studies remedial with  mr. sham ... noticed that all my posts have titles now? i spent a hell lot of time putting on the titles, so u better appreciate it! haha just joking... i went to parkway just now and checked out mph...saw a really funny looking guy at the food court cause he looked younger than me from behind, but he had a visible mustache when he turned around, and he had armpit hair! u may not know what i mean, but u have to see him first...it was a weird sight, but the guy looked pretty ok otherwise, clad in a singlet, and he was caucasian, so, ya... pls pray for isaac, he's been so grouchy today, and he has been in the worst of moods today, even though he has been spoilt so much, but i guess i need to pray for him...u guys can help too i will edit some posts now and add song lyrics to them, so check'em out!!  until neggz tym!

      its raining now, and caleb's having tuition, and we all just came back from  paragon , the shopping mall we ate chinese food for lunch at this famous  xiao long bao  restaurant, whose name i can't recall..anyway it was pretty okay, and my dad chose the place for us, but i wasn't too happy coz my dad chose the place on the spot without consulting us and asking us if we wanted to go. i didn't wanna go, for one thing, but i didn't,like, object to his decision coz i didn't think anyone would agree with me if i wanted to go elsewhere that my parents didn't fancy (of course not to spite them, just that they had a very different style of cuisine from what i liked) anyway, i wanted to have a dessert at  starbucks  or even  delifrance , but my parents wanted to shop for groceries at  marketplace , so i went to read magazines, and scouted around the mall basement...and i had to say that there was too much food around and one could be spoilt for choice there...they had stuff like  new zealand's natural  selling smoothies and ice cream, plus  mrs fields' ,  breadtalk ,  nooch noodle bar ,  orange julius  and  bravissimo  italian ice cream...and that was wasn't the end yet! i also went to a cd shop called  gramophone  which is the coolest cd shop i've been to so far...and its cheaper than  sembawang  cd shop, and more user friendly than  that cd shop ...i wish i had bought the  piano songs  cd...but it's too late to do that now...so i'll just wait till the time comes... favourite song for today...did u recognise the title...it's a phrase in the song that hit me today...it's  extraordinary  by  liz phair  here are the lyrics:   You think that I go home at night Take off my clothes, turn out the lights But I burn letters that I write To you, to make you love me  Yeah, I drive naked through the park And run the stop sign in the dark Stand in the street, yell out my heart To make, to make you love me  I am extraordinary, if you'd ever get to know me I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho  You may not believe in me But I believe in you So I still take the trash out Does that make me too normal for you?  So dig a little deeper, cause You still don't get it yet See me lickin' my lips, need a primitive fix And I'll make, I'll make you love me  I am extraordinary, if you'd ever get to know me I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess  See me jump through hoops for you You stand there watching me performing What exactly do you do? Have you ever thought it's you that's boring? Who the hell are you?  I am extraordinary, if you'd ever get to know me I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho  Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho  Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho  Average every day sane psycho    i'm gonna nap now, so keep visiting till next time!

      guys i bet some of u noticed a big error in one of the entries, regarding  k-ci and jojo ...who are  fantasia barrino 's cousins... i thought that the  jojo  who sang  leave (get out)  was from  k-ci and jojo , only to realize that  k-ci and jojo  are male and  jojo  is female, so both are completely different...  jojo  is 13 years old...the youngest i guess out of so many super young teenage pop queens like  hilary duff, avril lavigne, ashlee simpson  ( jessica simpson 's younger sis),  amy studt  and  joss stone , so i think that's remarkable and i respect her...plus she has an amazing voice! hope u got the message guys...gonna do homework, catch up soon!

      hi guyz, its been a long week lately and i'm more than hapi to b able to post this on the blog... i watched AMI until 12 laz nite and today i face the music, feeling like a completely worn out duffel bag because i am so shacked and i have nearly no energy to do anything, and to think that i actually survived through my choir practice (standing up, using diaphragm support, keeping focused) really seems quite a feat when i think about it now. i saw heath chan in school today during my PE lesson, which i skipped (post exam period PE lessons amount to nothing) and we were really surprised, coz i was with bernard and miguel, and we found out he was sick and his dad was around to pick him up so that he could go home...well i believe him...explains why he didnt go for choir 2 weeks straight, although he did  ponteng  hmm... my favourite song for today is  on the horizon  by  melanie c  (out of spice girls) so here are the lyrics:   People see different things When they look on the horizon Do you see dark clouds rolling in fast Cos baby they ain't gonna last  And I can't see anybody else I can't stop looking at you Take this dream and make it true  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin  This world could be so hard to take Before I found you, I almost stopped trying To see the good instead of the bad But your hearts so true, that baby I'm cryin  And every single time we meet I learn what love is for It's taking less and giving more  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin  And baby I don't wanna see pain in your eyes Cos you're the one that sets me free There's nothing in this world that can hurt us If it's you and me, hey-yeah-yeah  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah (All i see is love on the horizon) Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin  I-I'm, flyin baby (All I see is love on the horizon) I-I'm, flyin baby  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin    there'll be a concert to watch acs choir, guitar ensemble and chamber orchestra, titled  kaleidoscope  anyway i hope my ahs pals will help me to buy tix ok? i will definitely go and support u guys at your combined concert so i hope u will support me...and btw i really hope to see u guys at the syf choral festival soon... i might not go to malaysia at all this holiday, coz my dad's busy and all my siblings have stuff on each week, like tutorials and ccas, and youth camp, so we cant really compromise with everybody. tomorrow there's the parent teacher meeting going on while i attend my choir practice at 9 am...yawn...my mum will go alone, to see my hcl, english, e math, and ss teachers, initially the physics teacher too but i couldnt find him after school to fit in a time slot... tonite is the results show for AMI, and i want to watch it really bad...i know who the winner is already but i cant give out the secret yet coz everyone's gonna get mad with me, right? oops its dinnertime, gotta go, i'll post the next one tomorrow, cyazz!

      today i get to use the com coz choir is cancelled for today, and i decided to use the com instead of going for my own prep...anyway today we started our swimming for PE lessons, and im delighted to be in group a!! group a is for the best swimmers...so thats quite amazing for myself...  tonight im going to ditch night prep and go for my former school's concert at victoria concert hall...the title of the concert is ladatur voce II...wth does that mean? sounds like latin...i'll be going with om tonight. initially i was going with heath as well, but couldnt get enough tix, so only om is going...  yesterday was cool coz most of the holiday assignments werent, like, due yet or the teacher didnt ask for them, so i got extra time, except that i slept at 2 am on sunday and 1 am last nite, doing my unfinished stuff, and that really didnt do me good...i woke up feelin so groggy...  yesterday during dinner the principal, Dr. Ong, aka drong, offered me some fries...coz my hall has so many peeps i sat at the end of the table near him (he always sits at the hall 3 table),so i thought it was nice of him...he really reminds me of my dad, coz both of them like to say "huh..." and sometimes they say it for no reason at all...*rolls eyes* which really gets on my nerves sometimes, just like girls always saying "like, ya...." i mean, bleaughxz, really.  might wanna go see spiderman 2 next monday with bernard and miguel, but my parents hate me watching movies, so i wont know the outcome, maybe i'll bluff my parents just this once...hehe!  today my physics teacher, mr patrick soo, wasnt around, coz he went to the states to study for further degree, so we had a new teacher. i only know her email was ckwek@acs_edu_[something] and she was pencil-thin, plus she was so  bochup , like slack you know?  by the way, i've joined friendster! remember to add me to your network if you have one! also please use this email to add me: danieltingkh@earthdome.com  thats all i have for now. when i have the time, i'll write again!

      this post will be the last one before school starts tomorrow. at 10 pm i will be back at my room in boarding school, packing out my stuff and probably rushing through the very last bit of my holiday assignments...  i dont like boarding school that much but i have no choice, coz im a new student at acs...and btw i might stay again next year for my o levels...so good luck to me!  today my bro titus had his frenz over for a party, and they are still here as i type this out...i wonder when they will leave...  had my hair cut just now at parkway by sri nada or sth lidat...it wasnt too bad...considering it cost less than 10 bucks...anyway usually my mum cuts my hair...and the first time she experimented her hair-cutting skils on me it was a disaster! so im kinda afraid of her doing it now, but she still cuts all my siblings' hair...actually cozmy hair is so thick and it curls, it's really challenging for anybody to cut my hair well...so i guess cutting my hair is considered a handsome feat to perform!  wonderin' if i should go for training tomorrow morning...dono how tired i'll be after so long...anyway i think mebe not, might go for afternoon training instead, hope to be more active in swimming this term!  need to go now...hope to be able to post something this week...and o yes!...bottom line: this holiday sucked a lot! didnt go out...so much homework...yuck man!...gotta go...cya!

      today was fine and stuff, had my flute lesson, had youth meetin, my usual boring morning...etcetcetc...just gonna speak a bit about how different it was today...  since my cousins stayed over last night, it was fun to see them again in the morning, since two nights ago they stayed around too, after goin to carrefour when it was nearly closing and stuff...then going to the suspension bridge at kallang indoor stadium...  anyway, despite staying up until 2 am last night, i woke up at 8 something...coz my room was too cold! i finished the book on  anne boleyn ,  king henry viii 's 2nd wife...so u see, i have quite a big interest in english history...believe me, king henry viii had 6 wives! they are named: 1. Catherine of Aragon 2. Anne Boleyn 3. Jane Seymour 4. Anne of Cleves 5. Catherine Howard 6. Catherine Parre thats really a shameless man, and plus he had many mistresses to have fun with! some kind of king...  i hope u enjoyed yesterday's poem....dont have one now...too lazy to type it out and my parents hate me sleeping out late...yeah...  saw enoch, alison and zhen qing in the youth meeting today after some time...teck yuke hitched a ride in my dad's car as well...and almost everyone shared a bit in the meeting, except for me, chatting up with enoch and daniel goh outside...and them lor...yong kwang came late with samuel...that was really funny...  had dinner with aunt nancy, cousins and family at food village at east coast....it was so packed we took ages to find a parking lot... but we had good food...initially we wanted to go to visit the sand sculpture contest...but when we finished dinner, there were crushed structures made by mischievious kids...aw man...wind then was cool and really nice...loved the sea all over again...wanted to sit by the stone cliff and contemplate on life, but had to go home...haha  i need to sleep now...ive decided to join friendster whenever the time permits me...so see ya soon!

      I woke up so late today coz i went out with ashden last nite and i had a late one...anyway i just came from the library loaded with books and with my cousins and bubble tea...so im just chillin  lots of my friends havent really touched their holiday homework...i've started but im stuck somewhere in each one... the only piece of work i've done and completed is biology...for chemistry i have the section a on mole concept to do...damn i hate the mole concept...a maths ive not started...e maths ive done like 3 questions...chinese, ive not finished the yellow book and the xu ci only 5 questions...jian bao hvnt done...feng shen bang read only 4 chapters...geog i havent attempted, so difficult man...and lit im stuck on chapter 7...still have 5 chapters to complete!! see so much work...and there are worse cases...  yesterday my parents were kinda worried that i went out until so late...initially i told them it was just lunch, but eventually i got home after 10 pm...so that was about 8 hours...yikes!! 2 hours on transport, so 6 hours of hanging out...i dont know, man, but my parents are really worried about me now and i think i need to be sensitive to them sometimes...but i guess ive become so cant-be-bothered-with-life-coz-it-sucks until i truly cant give 2 hoots about nothing anymore...  after a long time, here's my song for the day:  hilary duff - why not    Why Not  You act like you don't know me When you see me on the street You're makin' like I turn you off When you know you think I'm sweet  It don't have to be like that I guess you're insecure If you say what's on your mind I might answer "sure"  So I walk a little slower And try to catch your eye Sometimes, it's so hard to see The good things passin' by  There might never be a sign No flashing neon light Telling you to make your move Or when the time is right, so....  (CHORUS) Why not Take a crazy chance Why not (Why not) Do a crazy dance If you lose a moment You may lose a lot So why not Why not  You always dress in yellow When you wanna dress in gold Instead of listening to your heart You do just what you're told  You keep waiting where you are For what you'll never know Let's just get into your car And go baby go  (CHORUS)  Oh...oh I could be the one for you Oh, yeah Maybe yes,  maybe no Oh...oh It could be the thing to do What I'm sayin' is You gotta let me know  You'll never get to heaven or even to L.A. If you don't believe there's a way Why not Take a star from the sky Why not Spread your wings and fly Oh-It might take a little And it might take a lot But...why not Why not  (CHORUS)

      yesterday was really eventful. we had our church meeting, then i went to  tung lok restaurant  at  liang court  to have lunch with uncle john chow and my grandma and cousins, and aunt nancy and diana. after that we went to malaysia with some church brothers, to  labis  in  johor . we got to the durian farm (my dad's) and ate some durian. my dad tried to dig a termite nest to look for a queen but failed.  and i didn't eat that much durian coz i was building a bonfire with my family. we didnt get that big a fire, though. later we went to a hot spring and soaked a bit. it was hotter than usual. the nice thing was, my dad 'bribed' the guy in charge to open the spring for us coz it was about to close when we got there. anyway i think i was the only 'brave' one to swim in the spring. most people couldnt have stuck their head in even. i did a handstand underwater-the only one. i was quite proud of that.  the shower afterwards was really good. sarah, my sis, found a nest near one of the fluorescent lights, and i thought that would be good, there were baby birds opening their mouths coz they were hungry. got joseph kor to take a picture for us there. thanks joseph!  the stars were really visible there coz it was faraway from light pollution. (didnt know that such pollution existed huh?) later we had dinner. it was really good, except for the spilt tea that kept dripping on my pants. we had deer meat and wild boar and frog leg. there was also the ultra-peppery pig intestine soup.  my dad calls delta goodrem  noise . like, what? u can call linkin park or simple plan, which are good to me, noise, but delta goodrem? noise? sheesh. sometimes i think he cant appreciate good stuff, you know? delta  good rem okay? have a really busy schedule ahead. tomorrow i have my church camp, and i have my syf choral festival today, tmr and thursday and some other days...and i have piano recital at allianse francaise on the day my camp ends...and i have my sph journalist camp on mon and tues next week. thats gonna be a waste of time. and plus, i still have SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much homework!! i will never finish all of it. damn. sorry about sounding like a comatose patient on my last entry. that was unintended for. i was just angry.  anyway, i need to go do some freaking homework now before my syf thing. God bless all of you. see you after my camp, or tomorrow.

      i have decided to write only when i have stuff to write. no point forcing myself to do things 'coz it's routine. i went to  parkway  again and saw  shayne , but she didn't see me. so i was sick that time and i felt bad. and i bought a smoothie from  new zealand all natural , to make matters worse. yesterday was a trip to  bugis . it was packed. went to  edge  and bought a wire keychain for a few bucks. it really wasnt worth it, later i thought. was late for piano later on. i guess i will never go shopping with them anymore. mum's the word. she's hopping mad and i guess she wont let me stay home anymore. i get eaten up by the com. no song for today. my song of remorse is all i can offer. pray for me. tell Him to reveal Himself in me and all of you.  need to get some work done now. see u agn when i have the time.

What's Your Flava? 2. Hidden Agenda 3. Rise and Fall 4. Spanish 5. World Filled With Love 6.

      yup, had a haircut last night by my mum, which i always think is less than satisfactory, but last night's one was ok, and i guess that u cannot really blame her for always cutting my hair wrong coz that curly tuft of hair on my crown is any amateur barber's nightmare, so it is quite a commendable effort, problem is my parents dont wana spend too much for me to go to barbershops for a haircut, but well, yeah i have 4 siblings, so i can understand, but i shall wait until i am old enuf to get the barbers to do a good job, but thanks anyway mum... i finally started my damn homework today, but i realise that i have so much to do, so i really need to buck up, anyway i might post another message later, so stay tuned...

      kaleidoscope has ended...yay! i thought we did pretty well...actually it was on friday and saturday, but den and my sibz all went last nite...we sang an encore last nite... the lion sleeps tonight ...and although it was bad, the audience liked it and the sang along to it even...  i didnt get to hear the chamber orchestra, but i heard the guitar and the sec4 chamber..liked the spanish pieces by guitar, but the pachebel was too cliche la...it was cold up there, my hands were freezing...we had a pep talk during the intermission after our performance, and we all thought we were complacent and were without energy...but after that everyone said they enjoyed everything...so i guess a little hard work and stress pays off!  after that when i got picked up by and parents and talking to joseph kor, we drove over to newton circus food court where i had dinner--hokkien prawn mee--and bought satay for my aunt nancy's family--consisting of her, uncle ben and her two oh-so-cute girls, my cousins charis and cassia--and we hung around, took some pix...for over an hour and then we went home...  today i woke up and i wasnt game for going to the church meeting coz i was so damn tired--slept at 1 pm--but i had to go anyway...dropped by the petrol staion b4 picking up aunt nanx...we got to the meeting hall abt 10 :30 am...after that we ate at coca steamboat in novena square...last moments of fun with my cousins...my aunt bought a yam cake for my grandma from han's coz its her [coincidentally] birthday...then we sent them to the airport and said long farewells to them...then we went home...  took a 2 hour nap at home and read a bit of  watership down  because i've finished the  anita shreve--the pilot's wife  already...then woke up had dinner...then i sit at the com...friendster...chat...blog...normalcy of internet life...  then tomorrow i have syf stuff after school lor...so bz man...i found this poem on christian rocha's site about starbucks: Starbucks   The ubiquity   of the ashen maiden   with her star crown and compliantly wavy tresses   is a metaphor of everything that is contemporary America:    &nbsp;  neocolonialism   commercialization   mindless consumerism   pop cultural dehydration.    &nbsp;  She has constructed   a whole new diagramof universal necessity.   With food, clothing and shelter   a new prerequisite is bornfor 'civilized' living:   a venti mocha frappuccino.    &nbsp;  Drink or die.     &nbsp; - Kathy Balilo   like it? i do...hehe...starbucks is good, but i think coffee bean is better...  i should have done this earlier, but i will summarize my thoughts of each of my roommates in boarding school, in room 348...  kaung set zaw:  he hails from yangon, myanmar, plays the guitar well and likes to sing and is a pretty cool, nice friendly guy who happens to be in my class too...he's my fav roommate and i talk to him lots...he usually helps me with my maths and i help him in english...hehe    &nbsp; lim zhiyang:  this guy is from china and is tall, in cross-country, has a real stern look on his face and has a deep voice...sings jay chou songs well...only talked to him once...    &nbsp; liu yijiang:  he's from china too and is quite petite for a sec4 guy...he's quite irresponsible because he doesnt leave a space for me in the bathroom towel rack and when im back on weekends he leaves some of his rubbish in my bin and plus he is messy, shoes and stuff strewn all over the place...but when i first knew him he was nice...and he even woke me up for dinner...    &nbsp; i need to go now...see all u guys soon! might visit ahs choir soon too!   &nbsp;

      i'm so depressed. partly coz i've got nothing to post.   stupid friendster! my testimonials--all approved, but none appear on the page! wtf is happenin'? i hope my frenz don't have to re-type another testimonial for me!   can't chat in peace or use friendster or blogger when my parents are home or when i dont know the time they will come home. that really sucks. they never seem to pick on my younger bro that much when he uses the com. and plus i hardly get the dumb com at home. i wish i could live away from my family now. that would be the best day of my life. though i need to learn to spend properly.   tomorrow i have school!! shucks. still have homework.  i'm sure my parents wont let me got to the botanic garden with my friend and stuff. they're so horrid to me nowadays. thats the good thing about boarding school. but my hall sucks too. the best hall would be hall 4. hall 3 has that terrible yvonne lim and grace kwee. i only like mr tan. and now i need to attend hcl remedial with wang fang hong. and my roommates wanna be with the china peeps. whatever.  gotta go research now. see ya soon!

      this blog was written in school. sorry for stopping halfway and not continuing after...but anyway, here i am now...  went to bintan on saturday nite and i really enjoyed myself! went snorkelling and got a nice deep tan...although it hurt quite a lot when i first got back to school on monday night! watched the euro '04 finals in the hotel the night before until about halftime...i surrendered to my sleepiness! surprising huh? greece won afterwards. when i watched it, portugal seemed like the team to nab it. by the way, my favourite player in portugal is cristiano ronaldo. his footwork is so damn cool, but i wish he had less shiny ear studs...  heard a couple of new songs this week and here's what i liked: Ashlee Simpson - Pieces of Me Janet Jackson - All Nite (Don't Stop) Counting Crows - Accidentally in Love Avril Lavigne - My Happy Ending Linkin Park - Breaking the Habit Kim-Lian - Teenage Superstar  btw, my chinese listening compre last saturday was fine, but it was harder than my practice papers of the previous years so it was kinda tricky at first...and oral comes later this month!  so its been a great week overall...going for braces' tightening on saturday! yikes its gonna be painful! and yup i have friendster now, after so many of my friends have been pestering me to join it! so add me at  danieltingkh@earthdome.com ...hey i think i posted this before! but anyway i gotta go! see you guys around!

      today was when joshua tian, a youth serving one in my church group, got married to sis. zoe, who also serves the youth group. i was kind of happy for them, especially since i've not seen bro joshua look so happy before.  i fixed the computer so that the sound works again! yay! i heard  autobiography  by  ashlee simpson . it's really good. the track i'm playing is  pieces of me  by her too, my favourite song for the time being.  please pray for my piano exam on tuesday, coz its gonna be a tough one. my scales are so darn bad. and my flute is kinda screwed up too. my tone is so down in the dumps and my scales basically suck too.  syf was last wednesday. after the performance, i went for haagen daz with ivan cheng, chee jun, kevin ho and jefferson. i bought the cheapest thing there. and it cost me $8.90...well. i have a sore throat now from eating mooncake. yeuuggh.  two more days to resume boarding school residence and im having mixed feelings about it. i go there, and i lose weight, have morning swimming trainings before school and morning revivals with my church pals, but i stay at home and have time to practise my music, have more internet time and get to see my family. so there's pros and cons.  i also managed to get ac idol tix from kenneth khing. yay! btw his blog's name is bigbloodybloggyblog or something like that. yeah.  yeah well thats about it. i guess i shall say more tomorrow. possibly. byez!  -ting-
