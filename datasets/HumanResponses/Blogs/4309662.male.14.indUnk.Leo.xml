        Toilet Paper   A blonde, a brunette and a redhead were walking along the beach. A seagull flies over and craps all over the blonde.  The brunette says in a disgusted voice, "Hang on the bathroom is just up the hill, I'll go get some toilet paper."  After she leaves the blonde begins to laugh.  The redhead says, "What's so funny?"  The blonde says, "Well, blondes are supposed to be so dumb and look at her. By the time she gets back with that toilet paper that seagull will be miles away!"      Head Phones     A blonde walks into a barber shop wearing a set of headphones.  She sits down in the chair and says I need my hair cut.  The barber starts to cut the right side then stops. He says, "You need to take off your headphones."  Blonde: "I can't, I'll just die!"  The barber cuts the right side and goes to the left side. He starts cutting then stops. He says, "You really have to take off your headphones."  Blonde:  "I can't, I'll just die!"  The barber cuts the left side and starts on the back. He starts cutting then stops again. He says, "Now, you REALLY have to take off your headphones!"  Blonde: "I can't, I'll just die!"  The barber starts cutting, but then stops. He leans over and grabs the blonde's headphones and pulls them off. She chokes, then falls to the ground dead.  The barber picks up the headphones and listens.  "Breathe In...  Breathe Out...  Breathe In...  Breathe Out..."
