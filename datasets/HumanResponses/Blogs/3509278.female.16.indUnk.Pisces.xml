      You used to be one of those people who knew when something was wrong even when I said nothing was.  I was comforted by you.  You let me cry, you patted my back an told me everything would be okay.  What about now? Is everything going to be okay now?  I need your comforting words now more than ever.  I need you back.

      It's funny how good it makes you feel when people notice things about you that you thought were just little quirks you had.  It's pretty awesome when someone tells you that they noticed something about you before they had ever even talked to you.  It's really really cool, and I'm glad someone besides me likes those little things about me.

      I just had the most interesting dinner I've had in awhile.  Today was my brother's eighth grade graduation.  Seeing him all dressed up made me remember how much fun I had at the end of my eighth grade year.  Then I went to high school and everything started off alright.  Excellent, even.  But things went downhill.  I thought i hated high school.  But I was thinking about it, and I realize now that I've gained more through these past two years than I had in my entire pre-high school life.  I went through so much--being separated from my friends, my mom getting sick, making new friends, adjusting to a new school, leaving another group of friends, adjusting to another new school, making more new friends.  Its been a hard couple of years, and while I would never choose to repeat them, it certainly has been a learning experience.  Thanks to everyone who has made them a little bit easier.  Now I know that I don't really hate high school...

It will be a good one, I can feel it!!  Manda, I'm here for you.  Anything you need, I'll do it.  *twiddle*

      I'm scared for my mom.  She says she hasn't been feeling well lately and she's been really tired.  What if she has a relapse? I doubt she'll be willing to put herself through the torture of chemotherapy again.  There's a real possibility that I could lose my mom if she has a relapse.  I don't want those responsibilities anymore.  I just want to be a kid.

      I love being silly.  It just lets me let go and not think about anything.  I don't care if people think I'm weird, they probably already do anyway.  I absolutely love just laughing out loud or burping and seeing someone smile and shake they're head.  "There she goes again!" they probably all think.  And I don't care.  I walked into a wall today.  Hard.  And I thought it was hilarious.  I wasn't embarrassed despite the multitudes of kids walking behind me.  I didn't even care.  I just laughed.

      It's funny how you can not see someone for so long, yet they still love you just as much, if not more, than the last time you saw them.  I always hear stories about how my little cousins talk about me and want to be like me.  No matter how long I go without seeing them, they always come to me for the first hugs.  I'm the fun one, the one who does what they want to do.  The babysitter who lets them stay up for that extra half hour and helps them build "tents" in the living room.  The one who pushes them on the swing and picks them up when they fall off.  They look up to me, and that feels good.

      I was looking at my pictures today.  They're not that great, but it was fun for awhile.  They reminded me of eighth grade, my trip to London, my trip to Spain.  But the more I looked at them, the bigger the pit in my stomach grew.  I finally gave up and put them down before I started crying over this, I do that too much.  I miss you, but I'll make it just fine on my own.

      I cried today.  I went up to my room, turned up my music, and just cried.  It's good for me sometimes.  It reminds me of when my sister broke her finger and they had to pop the blood blister to relieve pressure.  But there's only so much pressure I can relieve before I start to wonder when this will be over.  When my life will drift back into my existence.  When I can be me again, I mean really be me.  When I can stop acting and actually enjoy myself.  You make me smile.  The way you joke with me and make a serious effort to get to know me better.  Thanks for caring.

      You wonder when I lost respect for you.  I remember exactly.  It was the day you told me I wasn't smart enough to form my own opinions.  The day you let me know you don't value my thoughts as valid.  The day you told me that age does matter, you told me you couldn't trust the opinion of a sixteen year old.  Why is all my respect gone?  If you don't think my thoughts count, I think the same way of yours.  You're the one that needs to tell me that I am smart, to push me to form my own opinions.  I don't get that from you and i'm not letting you into my life until you realize it.

      I saw you crying and I felt the same way.  I hate crying in front of people.  But I love you! I'm here for you  Good friends are like antiques; they are more precious with time.                                           -Anonymous

      Remember when we were little?  How we were practically inseperable?  How we always promised to be best friends forever?  Well I just wanted to let you know that you're still number one to me because I'm pretty sure I don't tell you enough.  Thanks for making me feel a little bit better, you put a smile on my face.  I don't know anyone who can say they've been best friends with someone for as long as we have, and I'm pretty sure no one else has as good a best friend as I do.  So thanks for caring.

      How could I be so cold-hearted?  After all you've been through.  You told me I saved you.  I was the one who got you through.  Why do I do things like that?  I love you.

      I didn't really want to admit it to myself.&nbsp; Not until I heard someone else say exactly what I was thinking did i really let it sink in.&nbsp; It tears me up inside to know that I feel this way and you have no idea, but it's better to know that I'm not the only one.&nbsp; That I have someone to turn to, someone who knows exactly how I feel.&nbsp;   Not only that, I'm leaving you out of one of the most important things in my life.&nbsp; That's something I should feel guilty about, right?&nbsp; But I don't.&nbsp; That someone knows, they knew all along.&nbsp; They know me, and I'm not so sure you do anymore.  *mine...yup...k*

      We didn't really do anything special, just hung out, but it was awesome.&nbsp; We got to talk about a lot of things I've been needing to talk about.&nbsp; I feel so much better about everything now.&nbsp; Thanks.

      I want you to know how much I care about you. I want you to know&nbsp;how happy you make me.&nbsp; Sometimes I have a hard time making the words come out.&nbsp; You bring out my shy side and i don't know why because I am most comfortable when I'm with you.&nbsp; So just know that I love you even if I can't always say it the way I want to.  *Happy doesn't even begin to describe it*

      Music is funny.&nbsp; It can remind you of people or times.&nbsp; It can make you feel every different emotion possible in the course of three minutes.&nbsp; It can bring people together.&nbsp; It can teach people about things they never knew before.&nbsp; There are a few songs that remind me of when I was little.&nbsp; A few that remind me of summer.&nbsp; A few that give me this indescribable feeling when&nbsp;I hear the beginnings.&nbsp; Some that I just want to scream the words to.&nbsp;&nbsp;I love all the old stuff, and the stuff that's all new to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Music is amazing.&nbsp;

      Someone made me happier than ever today just by being totally honest.&nbsp; It made me want to smile and cry at the same time.&nbsp; And I'm glad that person had the courage to say to me what I wish i had the courage to say to them because I felt the same way. &nbsp; Amanda--I missed you soo much! I love you.

      I just realized how much I miss them.  The awesome, giddy feeling I get inside when I'm with them. The way I want to cry when I'm hugging them goodbye because I can't handle not knowing when I'll see them next.  I truly love them, and I hope they know that.

      It finally felt like summer.  Spending time with people who enjoy your company as much as you enjoy theirs.  Laughing at embarrassing moments :) Driving around with no real plans or places to go.  Running around barefoot on the moon.  Giggling at things that aren't really funny.  Not caring what people think :)  Being kids with no worries.  I loved every second of it and would do it again in a heartbeat.  *You make me just as happy as I make you!*

      I feel like we've just met.  Like we're becoming friends and we love each other but neither knows much of the inner workings of the other.  Because that's how it goes.  You love me and I love you more than words can say, but rather than knowing more about each other over all these years I feel like we know less.  I don't like it.  I'm here for you to talk to.  I won't laugh at you and I'll help you when I can I promise.  You can talk to me, I want you to.  I just want to know how you feel.

      When we were younger we were the best of friends.  We knew each other better than we knew ourselves.  Despite months of not seeing each other because of the distance between us, we could always pick up where we had left off the last time.  We came to treasure our sleepovers more than life itself.  There are pictures of us at family gatherings and we're holding onto each others hands as though they were glued together.  We could laugh about everything, including getting in trouble because it never happened to one of us without the other when we were together.  We still go months without seeing each other, and recent pictures don't show us holding hands.  Somehow getting in trouble just isn't as funny as it used to be.  But we still treasure time together, and we still know each other better than ever.  And we're still the best of friends.

      I love you baby more than anything in the world.  Everything is going to be okay.   The tough times are coming I know.   For you they've already started.  But we can do it because we love each other and because we have our friends behind us all the way.   Thanks to all of my amazing friends.   I know you can do it and I will do my best to try also.  And I will never give up.  I love you.

      I had a pretty awesome night.   Great friends, awesome food, laughs.  The realization that this title doesn't belong to you.   A surprisingly cool mom.   It definitely felt like summer with a few good surprises from people I've missed.  Sadly, you weren't one of those people. I may end up losing you, but everything will be for the better in the end.
