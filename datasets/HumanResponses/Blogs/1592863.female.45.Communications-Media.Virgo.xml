      Darn it! I'm still trying to figure this thing out.   At any rate... there's an EBay conference in town this weekend and I'm signing up as the PRESS. I AM the press, well, not ALL of the press, but I am a part of that megolithic multinational meandering piece of crap known as the press but it doesn't make me proud, especially in light of how recent events in this country were covered. But that's another blog...  So, can you do tables and all sorts of nifty html tricks inside this thing?       A Table       I guess you can. Oh yay.

      I'm still learning how to move around on this (in?) thing. I just figured out how to add another post. Whee! We're rockin' now!  I also learned how to do pictures... let's see if this works:

      Oh man! A blank box. I hate blank boxes. This thing should ask you questions such as "what's your favorite color" or "do you like macaroni and cheese?" Better yet, how about those a/s/l questions chatters throw at you all the time that nobody ever answers honestly. Or do they? I have no idea what this thing will be about. I've never done this before. I'm not even good at keeping a diary or journal. I even tried that Artist's Way program and couldn't keep up with the "morning pages." The only thing I can think about in the morning is "coffee" and getting the cat off the top of my head (where he likes to sleep) and taking the dog out for a pee.   Maybe this BLOG will become a sort of "morning page" except I'll be writing in it at all hours of the day and night whenever my brain has been fueled on caffeine and I feel the need to ruminate on whatever.  So... has anyone seen the new Escher-style Google logo? It rocks, huh?

      I hate it when I get ideas and I don't act on them right away. I get these thoughts in my head that remain for hours -- almost to the point where the entire thought has a beginning, middle, and an end and I can do amazing things with them. But I don't write them down or do anything to hold on to those thoughts so they disappear and are gone into the ether forever.  I meant to write an entire spiel about how many numbers you had to press to get someone at Earthlink to talk to you. It brought up an entire issue about customer service and how it's all just gone downhill in this country. You can eventually get someone on the phone to talk to you, and they seem nice (or drugged... based on how many irate customers they already had to deal with... wouldn't want THAT job), but the length of time it took to get to that one voice is just astounding. I know there are more people in the world, but is this the shape of things to come? If so... I will volunteer to be the first settler on the moon, Mars, wherever...

      Wah! I forgot I had this blog... I completely forgot. Please forgive me! Really! I pray to the Blog Gods to have mercy on my unblogging heart. I've been distracted, terribly, but I'm back.
