              I was six years old When my parents ran away I was stuck inside a broken life I couldn't wish away She was beautiful She had everything and more And my escape was hiding out and running for the door Somebody listen please It used to be so hard being me Living in the shadow Of someone else's dream Trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me Living in a nightmare A never-ending sleep But now that I am wide awake My chains are finally free Don't feel sorry for me All the days collided One less perfect than the next I was stuck inside someone else's life and always second best Oh, I love you now 'cause now I realize That it's safe outside to come alive in my identity So if you're listening There's so much more to me you haven't seen Living in the shadow Of someone else's dream Trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me Living in a nightmare A never-ending sleep But now that I am wide awake Then I can finally be Don't feel sorry- Mother, sister, father, sister, mother Everything's cool now Mother, sister, father, sister, mother Everything's cool now Oh, my life is good I've got more than anyone should Oh, my life is good And the past in the past I was living in the shadow Of someone else's dream Trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me I'm living in a new day I'm living it for me And now that I am wide awake Then I can finally be Don't feel sorry for me Don't feel sorry, don't feel sorry for me Living in, living in, living in the shadow Living in, living in, living in a new day

         I've been waiting all day for ya babe So won't cha come and sit and talk to me And tell me how we're gonna be together always Hope you know that when it's late at night I Hold on to my pillow tight And think of how you promised me forever (I never thought that anyone) Could make me feel this way (Now that you're here boy all I want) Is just a chance to say  [Chorus] Get Out, (leave) right now, It's the end of you and me It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone 'Cause I know about her (who) and I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right but you was just a waste of time (waste of time)  Tell me why you're looking so confused When I'm the one who didn't know the truth How could you ever be so cold To go behind my back and call my friend Boy you must have gone and bumped your head Because you left her number on your phone (So now after all is said and done) Maybe I'm the one to blame but (To think that you could be the one) Well it didn't work out that way  [Chorus]  I wanted you right here with me but I have no choice you've gotta leave Because my heart is breakin' With every word I'm sayin' I gave up everything I had On something that just wouldn't last But I refuse to cry No tears will fall from these Eyeee-eeee-eeees Ooooh, ooooh Get out  [Chorus X3]

         On a Monday, I am waiting Tuesday, I am fading And by Wednesday, I can't sleep Then the phone rings, I hear you And the darkness is a clear view Cuz you've come to rescue me  Fall... With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  I am moody, messy I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care When I'm angry, you listen When youre happy, it's a mission And you wont stop 'til I'm there  Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast Well, I hit that bottom Crash, you're all I have  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say? Am I that obvious? And if it's written on my face... I hope it never goes away... yeah  On a Monday, I am waiting And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms... So I can breathe  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I love the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...
