      S o like I said before, Wednesdays suck. I, instead, went running yesterday & am feeling Thursday like no other. I did the 30 minutes at the 11 minute pace with a few small bursts of 9 &amp; 10 minute pace. But like I said before, this faster pace is a little harder. I am not complaining at all though. I love that I was a little more sore than I have felt before. I also managed to run 3.06 miles which is showing a little progress. Maybe that means I am actually getting a little better. Happy to say the least.       I haven't gone running yet today, as I am feeling a little ill & was worried if I ran today I might invite the flu which has been running rampant.       A few women at work are starting the LA Road Runners tomorrow and I am considering joining them. I think it might not be a bad idea. I have kind of thought of my running as sacred since I have been doing it alone. I am a little concerned about sharing my running experience so soon. On the otherhand, this group is incredibly supportive of its runners, with trainers, water &amp; gatorade booths, bananas and shoe experts all on hand to assist you in your training. I am thinking I might join up with them in a week or two & see how that goes. Maybe after I have a little more confidence in my abilities. That's the other thing...I am nervous of looking like an idiot in front of all these experienced runners. Geez, these are people trying to finish the marathon in 3 hours or less...well not all of them, but damn that would be amazing!      Anyhow, I am really enjoying this running thing and will promise to keep you all updated. There are so many bonuses to running; I have tons more energy, I have a "happy" feeling, and today I put on my Bj's belt which I normally wear on the 3rd hole & it went easily to the 4th hole. Very exciting, I must say. Maybe by the end of the month I'll need to buy a new belt. Woohoo. Ok have a great weekend &amp; thanks again for the support.      much love &amp; many thanks,   t

      Okay so I don't have much to report today. Didn't get to the gym b/c I was so exhausted. Wednesdays are not the best day for me to fit in my workouts, so I am making some adjustments. Since Thursdays work way better for me, I am going to change up the schedule and workout on Thursday instead. So the new plan is Monday, Wednesday, Saturday off &amp; pick it up Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday!  I also got stood up from my 3x a week buddy today. Kind of bummed me out! But I am sure we will work on making up for it.  I am planning on swimming tomorrow after the run. So I have something exciting to look forward to manana!  Keeping you posted...

       Okay so today marks the first day of running for week 2! Look out kids it's getting crazy. Actually not really. This morning I tried to increase my pace to about an 11 minute mile. It was a little harder than I expected, so I probably only did 25 minutes at that pace with 5 minutes increasing from 12 minute mile to 10 minute mile pace. I almost covered 3 miles in 30 minutes (2.99). Which is farther than I had been able to go before for 30 minutes so I guess I can't be too disappointed. I am going to try to do the whole thing tomorrow at the 11 minute pace. We'll see how that goes.      After this week I think I am going to try & incorporate some strength training into my running. But not too heavy on the legs, probably more arms, back &amp; core. I am also starting to swim on my days off from running. That should be nice. Anyhow glad to be back in LA, but I do miss seeing my family more.       On non-running note, I got to go home & visit with family &amp; friends this weekend. Danelle & Nick had their "Cali" reception and it was good to see folks again. It's too bad we couldn't get together more often. And you already know that I got to see Gino score his first big time soccer goal. To top it off my Aunt Nicole, Kyle &amp; Nick came out to Manteca and we had dinner & went bowling. Couldn't have asked for a better weekend...unless of course I could have gone to the river &amp; maybe did some time behind a boat. But maybe next month!       Thanks again for sticking around &amp; reading this... don't be shy if you got something to say, please do so in the comment section or email me anytime--   urlLink  pblcenmy1@aol.com       lots of love to you all!

       Okay just wanted to keep this updated...Finished week one! Its   very exciting. Today I increased my time to 40 minutes, but kept the same pace and completed 3.47 miles. According to the guide I am following, Sunday is the day you do a "long" run. I am pretty sure 40 minutes isn't "long," but it was longer than I had run before.  Total weekly mileage is at 12.02 miles.  Slow & steady baby!  I tried some of the form tips and found that my back feels much better and today actually seemed pretty easy. I also tried running uphill more which I have been told will alleviate any pain I might experience with the stress fracture. Anyhow, had great workout and can't wait for Tuesday! I think I am going to try to increase the pace next week to an 11 minute mile, but we'll see.  thanks for being here &amp; have a great sunday! (3 more weeks &amp; you can be watching football right now...oh yeah  Raiders  took out the  9  ers  yesterday! woohoo)

       Okay, as promised I will be keeping y'all posted on the progress & Friday I had a minor setback. Actually I just kept pushing running back until it was 11 p.m. &amp; finally canned it. Soooo...I had to make up for it today & I did. I did a 30 minute one today covering 2.86 miles. Kept the same minute pace but did 3 minutes at a 10 minute mile just because Christina Aguilera makes me want to run faster...I am such a dork.       But I will be running tomorrow for sure. I just couldn't resist a little family time &amp; going to see my little brother's soccer game. I got to be there to see him score his first goal. That was worth missing running for sure. Besides I ran into an ex-marathon runner today who gave me some good form tips (which I am going to need to work on) and some great inspiration. I suppose the universe made it work out that way! Crazy how that works!      Okay thanks again for checkin' out this blog!       peace &amp; love,   t

        A long time ago in a land far, far away a young girl watched her mom go from a vibrant young woman to a person that could no longer get out of bed to do the most mundane things on her own. There are not words that can describe how hard it is to watch someone you love deteriorate. I was only 14 years old when my mother lost her battle with cancer. Since that time I have been loosely involved with events to raise cancer (specifically breast cancer) awareness. But I have failed in my efforts to make my voice heard and really make progress towards defeating this disease.       I always thought I was cursed to die young from cancer as well. But I promised myself if I lived to be 30, I would run a marathon. I don't know why I chose to run a marathon, but I knew 2 things to be true; 1) my mom didn't make it to 30 & if I did then I needed to do something to celebrate, 2) My mom never got to run a marathon. Not that she ever would have, but why not do it for her? I turned 26 this past year. This was around the age my mom first found cancer invading her body.       In the past year I have been thinking about the goals in life I was hoping to accomplish. Because I'll be damned if that disease is going to take me out before I do what I have set out to do in this world. I always thought I would be married with kids, be a partner in some high powered contracts firm, driving a Lexus by now. Alas, I am still slowly but surely working on getting out of UCLA alive, no kids &amp; no real prospects at a husband (if you know anyone...heehee), my transpo includes a big blue bus & occasionally a green or red one, and I am so far from the firm...and I don't just mean my thighs!       Anyhow, I realized that life is too short to wait for some bench mark year to accomplish your goals. Then things started falling into place.  Runner's World Complete Book of Women's Running  practically jumped off the library shelf into my arms. I open the book &amp; it opens to "Beginning Marathon Training Schedule." It was like the bright lights of the McDonald's beaconing drivers off the highway, but better. Then a UCLA Oncology department Bj's regular gives me a  LIVESTRONG  bracelet. I realized I couldn't wait 3 more years. This was the year I was going to do this, for me & for my mom &amp; all moms, grandmas, sisters, aunts, cousins & friends.       So I have set out on this journey &amp; hope to share the ups & downs with you, my family &amp; friends. Your comments are not only welcomed but encouraged. I look forward to the next 6 months or so with excitement and anticipation. Thank you for taking the time to be there & read this. Keep your eye on your mailbox, as I am hoping to use this event to raise money for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and will need all the support I can get to raise money for marathon expenses as well as donations in my mom's name, Connie Coleman Campiotti, to the Foundation.       In choosing the LA marathon I get to do an event that is local to my current hometown. It also enables me to train with some of the local Native students through the Students Run LA program (hopefully), and 2005 marks the 20th anniversary of the City of Los Angeles Marathon. What an exciting time!       So that's the why of it...now I guess you want to know how? Especially since most of you know I am not anywhere near marathon shape. This week had the countdown to the marathon (MARCH 6, 2005) at 30 weeks. The training schedule is set for 19 weeks. I wanted to start now so that I could play some catch up with my body.   By the time we are 19 weeks out, things should be looking pretty good.       Schedule has me running 4 times a week with Monday, Thursday &amp; Saturdays off.       This week I walked for 30 minutes on Monday, ran 30 minutes Tuesday (2.82 miles), missed Wednesday due to circumstances beyond my control, ran 30 minutes Thursday (2.87 miles) & when I am done here I am off for another 30 minute run and bump up to 40 minutes on Sunday.       My pace right now is around a 12 minute mile. It is hard to not start off fast trying to get back to a 8 minute mile from when I could kind of run. But I am trying to go at a pace that I might be able to keep during the marathon.       I will be keeping you all posted on all the developments including speed increases, distances, etc. Any training suggestions, comments, concerns are welcome so please post on the comment section or email me:     pblcenmy1@aol.com     .        Thanks for the love &amp; support.      If you are interested check out the marathon website at:   urlLink http://www.lamarathon.com    and the Susan G.
