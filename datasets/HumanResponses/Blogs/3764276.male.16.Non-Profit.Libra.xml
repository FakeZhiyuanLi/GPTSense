      Well for the past week or so, I have essentially been nocturnal- the earliest I woke up was 3, and the earliest I went to bed was last night- at about 4.  But for some reason, I am off of it, with an incredible waking time of 10 AM this morning.  Oh well, I guess all good things come to an end sometime.

      So my little fantasy world, these little ideas I have been entertaining might actually become something- how crazy is that?  Ahh, this summer is actually turning out pretty decent- of course, that doesn't include dipshit greg failing his fucking math regents.  AHHHH, oh well, maybe you'll see me again New York, maybe not.  But anyways- other than that- this could be a good summer.

      These last few days have been interesting, I almost feel like I am living a movie or something.  First, summer school ends and I am pissed about not saying anything.  So to rectify that, I of course decide to get the number some other way, and do.  Then she is on vacation, which really didn't make anything better.  But coming upon her blog was very interesting.  That part of this whole little journey would have never happened in my wildest dreams.  Can you imagine that?  Here I am, not even knowing if the girl realizes that I really exist, and she devotes a whole entry to me.  Ha, isn't life funny.  So now I wait, and who knows what's going to happen.  Hopefully something better than normal.  Because of course, I have a knack at screwing good possibilities up, I guess we will wait and see.

      I decided, after much thought I may add, that it was a good time to create one of these.  I have always been interested, and since you created yours Matt, what the hell.

      Tomorrow should be interesting.  First we have the possible beginning of something very great.  Then my father gets back from China- and apparently he bought me some cool instrument or something. It sounds cool at least, and if there is one good thing about having a father that travels at least 90% of the time, it is getting cool stuff.  But back to my main source of excitement about tomorrow, what I have waited for weeks for is going to be here, she's coming home.  But I won't say much on that, I don't want to jinx myself just yet- because with my past record, I will eventually.

      Amongst the many wonderful things that have been happening in my life, or that are soon to, there lies one area of this- my existence- that needs some help.  I really don't know what to do with my hair- shave it nearly off?  like I tend to each year, or let it grow?  You guys decide- leave a comment stating your opinion and if at all possible why.

      It's an interesting experience, holding a lit bottle rocket in your hand until just before it takes off, until the fuse is non existent, and then gently lobbing it into the air for it to fly wherever it wants. Of course it gets a little more interesting when that same thing comes straight back at you, and you and the other five people around have to run like hell.  And i decided, fireworks are no fun anymore, at least not when they are done correctly.  I get no amusement from buying nearly $40 worth of stuff and then just lighting it- i would have much rather kept the money my mom gave me for myself, just to keep it (I'm sorta cheap).  But oh well, it's gone now. Now there is one thing that didn't go well yesterday, and that was me not finishing my god damn movie.  While many people might overlook it, I personally believe that was the most important part of the day, my movie.  So now I have to go to Hollywood Video or Blockbuster and rent it.  And of course then, they are going to think i am fruity or something, renting an english romantic comedy.  So can I really go and do that?  I will of course, so the rest of Love Actually better be worth it.    I guess the only thing left to say is Happy Birthday America, let's try to squeeze out just a few more, like make it to 250 before you keel over.  Personally, I don't know how we are going to do it though.

      the past 24 hours were very interesting, some of the most interesting I have had in quite a while.  First there is my phone conversation that somehow survived not only into the night, but through it till the break of day.  Then of course, in the middle of my sleep that I desperately needed, my mother decides that she needs my help with the dogs and their vet appointment.  So at 8:30 (remember, I didn't get to sleep until 6) I had to wake up and go to the appointment.  So then I get back around 11, and of course my dad starts bitching because I want to sleep- DUH! haha, so I go to bed, wake up at 6:30. Eat.  And then went to Starbucks where I was actually able to meet her, for the first time really.  So Starbucks went well of course, after the first few minutes.  Then I left, and now we come to the interesting part of the whole day (not really, but it isn't bad).  I had a blowout, well my mom was driving at the time, and we pulled into a gas station parking lot so I could change the tire.  I did but while we were there, this little kitten was sitting right next to the road.  So obviously, we couldn't just let it get hit by a car and we brought it back to the house.  Very nice day, that I will say.

        What an array of emotion,&nbsp;hope, dismay, happiness, bitterness.&nbsp; The list goes on and on and then on again some more.&nbsp; When I flew up there, I felt as if I were leaving a prison, this god damned place that stifles your spirit, your soul, not to mention your body in its 100 degree heat and the humidity to match.&nbsp; So there I was on a Continental Boeing 737-700 rising swiftly through the smog, my lungs finally getting a chance to breathe clean air as we cruised at 30 thousand feet.&nbsp; As I let the world I live in slowly slip through my fingers and reached for this fantasy that I would be living for the week. My arrival to Syracuse was equalled in enthusiasm from my old friends by nothing else that I have ever seen.&nbsp; The unconditional love on their faces, the purity of their souls, their clear outlook on life.&nbsp; It is something that is impossible to find here, these people were just good, and genuine in their happiness to see me again.&nbsp; If you have never had people who truly cared for you, it is amazing, something unequalled by anything.&nbsp; but alas, I made myself realize that my stay there was a short one, that staying was not a possibility.&nbsp; So with reluctance I became who I was, I was Gordon once again.&nbsp; Gordon from Texas, the friendly, sociable guy who everyone loves.&nbsp; The witty, honest me who I find so hard to express here, I was myself once again.&nbsp; Myself, something that only on rare occasions had&nbsp;I been able to be in the past year.&nbsp; Myself, and only that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shortlived, but nothing equals that splendor, the magnitude of such a realization.&nbsp;   Now of course, I am no longer Gordon from Texas, I am Gordon, I am the kid who although has no lack of friends, has not fully accepted his position.&nbsp; I am the kid who had ringworm, the kid who was nipping in class.&nbsp; Bug boy for those of you who have had the pleasure of spending your actual childhood with me.&nbsp; Not a life that I would ever consider bad (maybe emotionally scarring and full of repressed memories) but altogether not bad.&nbsp; The funniest part of my whole experience is that it wasn't bad to come back.&nbsp; I dreaded it my whole flight, I hated the idea, but when I saw Houston, felt the wheels bounce along the ground, and finally come to rest.&nbsp; I had a sense of finality to everything.&nbsp; I know now, and accept unconditionally that for the moment there is no other place I can be.&nbsp; This is my life.  So now I am home.&nbsp; Back of course to the pursuit of apathy and one Ms. Holmes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun times I hope.

       found these in a friend's profile- and all I have to say is how true.  Q: What is the worst thing invented by humans thus far?  A: Religion.   Q: Who is/was the liberal who has caused the most worldly damage?  A: Neville Chamberlain.  (for those of you who don't know much about history- Neville Chamberlain was the prime minister of Great Britain before the official start of World War II.&nbsp; He is the one who allowed the Germans to invade surrounding countries in Hitler's attempt to regain the "Fatherland"&nbsp; Luckily the British people saw him unfit for service and Winston Churchill was elected.)

      I sit now staring at my computer, unable to believe what I&nbsp;have decided, what I decided long ago really.&nbsp; I will march this year, and next, and for however long that the opportunity presents itself to me.&nbsp; For it is such a large part of my life, such an important piece of my being that I fear an existence without it.&nbsp; And really- it isn't that bad, the practices can be a bit monotonous and boring, but that feeling when you step on the field, when you are in competition is just amazing.&nbsp; since of course I am too lazy to do a real competitive activity like&nbsp;track which I really have a great deal of skill in- this marching business is just an easy way to get that rush without the real work or commitment.&nbsp; So for another year I am drawn to this hell of marching, should be fun.

      I decided today that my days of hippiedom were over.  It's too late now of course to go back, the hair is gone.  It was a little scary walking into Supercuts, I saw the woman behind the counter, and the various razers and clippers and scissors sitting behind her, and I could see in my mind what they would do to my head.  But still, I walked forth and after giving my name, sat in that seat with my little cape thing tied around my neck. I was ready.  Expecting nothing more than me wanting a trim, she asked- "What would you like done today sir?" My response of "A #1 on the sides and about finger width on top"  startled her, as she stared at me for a good five minutes.  Then the fateful clippers were raised to my head, motor inside whirring, and quickly she brought them in an arc upwards across the back of my head, removing any remnance of the past year.  So now I sit, a good 9 inches shorter of hair, and wonder- should I have done it.  But such questions really serve no purpose, have no reason- for nothing can bring it back now.  I feel different though, like a new person.  For those of you who I bitch to, or seem to make false promises as to my actions in this coming year- take me seriously, because this is a year of change, a year of success in my life.  You will all see what I have to offer this year.  No absences, no forgotten projects, no apathy.  You will see me this year, not this sham that has existed for too long now, you will see my true might and ability.  One last thing- the organization of the band this year, the directors and their practices are really getting to me.  Today when I saw a good saxophone player make the decision to quit what he enjoys, because of the program and its inequities- I was pissed.  I pray that I am not put in the same situation, that I am seeing things a little exagerated right now, but I don't think so.  We'll see I guess.  Ha- Of course there is the fact that next Wednesday I will be kicked out most likely.  We'll see.

      It's been some time since I've taken the time to write here.  I can't legitimately say it's because of the workload of my 4 AP classes and the other responsibilities that come with school, but come on people, it's me.  I guess, for lack of a better excuse I'll use that one though, or maybe I could say the truth- that I've been taking many naps and watching a lot of TV.  You pick which one you think sounds better.   But realistically, I am looking forward to this year a lot, I really am going to plan on not being as I was last year.  I can't say what will happen yet, but it doesn't look too bad so far- I've only missed a few things.  We'll see, that's all I can say.
