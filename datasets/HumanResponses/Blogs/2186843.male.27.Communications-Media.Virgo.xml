        You know, on a normal day, I wouldn't think too much about seeing a guy walking down the streets of Lowell wearing a full Superman outfit.  But since it's Halloween, I'm hoping he was in costume.  Or else Superman really let himself go.  He looked like he'd put on a few pounds, and hadn't showered or shaved for a few days.  What would Lois Lane say?  Maybe she left him for another superhero.

        Gotta give a shout out to the listener who brought me the 6 pack of Sam Adams Octoberfest yesterday, even if he did drink one of them on the way to the studio.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: No beer tastes quite as good as free beer.  My sidekick can have all the candy and baked goods he wants.  Just bring me the liquid refreshment.  So it's Halloween.  Hopefully there's no kids in my building who'll be knocking on my door today, 'cause I didn't buy any candy to give out.  They'd have to choose between a bottle of the Octoberfest, a leftover slice of pizza or a half-eaten jar of peanut butter.  Which one would  you  take?  And before you ask, no, I'm not dressing up for Halloween.  I stopped doing that when I was 13.  I may, however, go check out a few of the haunts around town tonight.  You know what the worst job to have on Halloween might be.  Teacher.  Remember when you were in grade school and it was Halloween.  Everyone wears their costume to school.  Everyone's all hopped up on candy that day.  Plus there's the promise of getting a ton of candy after school.  Who in the world could concentrate?  They seriously should just give schools the day off.  At least elementary and middle schools.  The high school kids are like that every day.  I can't imagine anything gets done today.  Hopefully teachers know this, and don't pick today as the day to teach the really important stuff kids need to know, like who was King of England in 1563, and how to figure out where Train A and Train B will meet if they leave Los Angeles and New York at the same time, heading at different speeds.  By the way, I'm not an expert on the rail system in America, but isn't it possible for those trains to take different routes, and thus they never cross paths?  Bring that one up to your math teacher and see where that gets you.  I have no idea how this relates to anything, so let's move on.  Quick note to the Sawks... normally teams wait until  after  they win the World Series before they dismantle the whole team.  In the space of a week, they've told their successful manager he's no longer welcome in this town.  And now yesterday, they take their cleanup hitter and offer him to any team that wants him FOR FREE.  This, on the same day they once again raised ticket prices.  Are you kidding me?  I know Manny's pretty selfish and his teammates probably hate him, but maybe you should have thought of that when you signed him for $20M a year.  They'd better be real careful, because people around here are going to be really pissed if that team finishes 4th in the division next year, just behind the Baltimore Orioles, managed by... wait for it... Grady Little.

        As I'm getting ready to leave the house this morning, I'm watching this HBO documentary about rich kids.  Not just rich kids, but FILTHY rich kids.  Publishing familys, the Trumps, people like that, who have hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars in the family.  It centers around the kids who stand to inherit all this money.  They're all late teens or early 20's.  Not to sound jealous, but most of these kids are basically nerds who haven't had much of a social life, probably because they're so rich.  They're involved in the Fencing Club at school, and when they talk, they sound like ultra-rich people.  Anyway, the whole thing is basically these rich kids whining about how rich they are, and "maybe my life would have been better without all this."  Meanwhile they're going to clubs in the Hamptons that seat you according to how rich and famous you are, and charge each table a two bottle minimum at 250 bucks a bottle (900 for a magnum of Cristal) while P. Diddy is sitting at the next table.  I'm here to tell you, your life wouldn't be better without the money, jackass.  You want to find out?  Give me your 700 mill and you can live in my apartment and struggle to pay the rent and not be able to afford health insurance.  Then tell me what you think.  Money is always better than no money.  They say money can't buy happiness.  Well, no money can't afford to buy anything.  Not that I'm bitter or anything.

        Well, I decided to post, just so I would go a whole day without putting something up.  Today was a pretty uneventful one, and I just don't have anything interesting to say.  So instead, here's a joke one of our listeners emailed me earlier:  Guido and Giuseppe were applying for their work visas in America. The agent asks Guido, "What kind of work are you trained to do?" "In da old country, Ima work in da garment factory.  Ima stitch-a together 500 pair of woman's panties a day!" "And what about you?, the agent asks Giuseppe. "I'm a deisel fitter." "You mean you're a mechanic?" "No ima worka with Guido.  After he stitch-a da panties, Ima pull 'em over my head.  If they no rip, I say "deisel fitter", and put 'em in da box.   Seemed appropriate with all the talk of underwear (or lack thereof) on the show the last couple days.  Thanks to Dolly for passing that one along.  Off to bed.

        Well, not much to do tonight, so I veg-ed out in front of the tube.  And there was some cool stuff.  The season premiere of 24: They lost me part way through last season, it just got too contrived.  So far, I'm on the fence about this one.  Jack's hooked on smack now?  Kim's working at CTU?  Seems a bit far-fetched.  We'll see if they can hold my interest.  The problem with the series is it's just too tough to come up with 24 hours of just one storyline.  It was good the first year because it was new, but now it's been done before.    Now, how about "The Joe Schmo Show"... if you haven't seen this one, you missed out.  For those who don't know, it's on SpikeTV, formerly TNN.  The premise of the show is, it's a reality show, where people get voted out of the house each week.  Only, everybody on the show is an actor, except for one guy, Matt.  So they contrive the whole thing just to F with his head.  Quality programming.  It came to an end tonight, as they finally let him in on the fact that the whole thing was a big joke on him.  He took it rather well, I thought.  Honestly, I think they found the perfect guy for this show.  He was just a really nice dude who's reactions were perfect all through the show.  Finally, I don't think there's a better show for someone my age than "I Love the 80's" on VH1.  Each episode focuses on one year, and it's all about the stupid TV shows, movies, fads, etc. from that year.  Great nostalgia about stuff that a lot of people wish never happened.  For me, it's all about my childhood.  Like "Miami Vice" fashion.  I'm ashamed to say I had a white suit with hot pink shirt, and the suit coat sleeves rolled up.  Good lord.  Although, at least I didn't really live through the disco era and all that ugliness.  My parents wouldn't let me watch MTV or "You Can't Do That on Television."  Amazing how tame that stuff was compared to what's on TV today.  I am a "child of the 80's."  If you've never read that piece, check out the link below.  It's really interesting what our generation is all about.  We're stuck between the Baby Boomers and Generation X.  We had great cheesy music, the girls had big hair, and we wore "friendship bracelets."  It was an pretty awful time, and I love it.

        It's not even 8:30 and I've already been on the phone 3 times.  I should still be sleeping, dammit.  First, someone calls me at 7:30 for no particular reason other than to bother me.  Obviously they haven't been explained my 10am rule.  "No non-emergency phone calls before 10am, unless there's an adequate reason to believe I'm already awake, i.e. you're picking me up to go golfing in 5 minutes."  Violators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  So I roll over and try to get back to sleep.  Then the station has a quick breakdown at 8, so more phone calls.  I've come to realize there's a mass conspiracy to prevent me from getting 8 hours of sleep in any one night.  I'd type more, but it's tough when you can only get your eyes half-open.

        Not much to report today.  'Bout time I had a slow day.  Had a big crowd at the season premiere of the Lock Monsters Monday night talk show.  We'll see how long that lasts.  Other than that, I didn't get much accomplished.  Held a much-needed laundry session this morning.  Kicked a little butt on the Playstation.  Stopped by the station for a few minutes somewhere in there too.  Back to the regular grind tomorrow, hockey practice in the morning, then station, then the afternoon show.  Yippee.

        Shocker of the Day: Grady Little is no longer the Red Sox manager.  And it had nothing to do with leaving Pedro in too long.  Right.  There is no truth to the rumor that I will be named the new manager of the Red Sox.  Theo didn't offer enough money.  Flipping around the tv today, I came across "Crossfire" on CNN.  The guy on there was wearing a bow tie.  Now, I know that's his thing, but come on.  Ties are uncomfortable enough.  Who decided that to dress up, a guy should tie a noose around his neck?  Great idea.  But better still is the bow tie.  It works with a tux because it belongs.  Not with a real suit or sportcoat.  At least a real tie looks nice.  Nobody ever wore a bow tie and sportcoat and didn't look like a total dork.  Apply for a new job:  urlLink Boston Red Sox   Look like a dork:  urlLink The Bowtie Club

        I just realized, I should probably include some info about me, just for those of you who happen to stumble onto this page for no particular reason.  I'm a moderately successful radio broadcaster in Lowell, Massachusetts.  I work as the play-by-play announcer for the Lowell Lock Monsters of the American Hockey League, and for Lowell Spinners baseball in the New York-Penn League.  Both of these teams, as well as an afternoon show I'm a part of air on WCAP 980AM in Lowell.  Tune in sometime if you're in the area.  Other personal stuff: I'm 27 years old, single, and a graduate of Syracuse University.  That's enough for now.

        I've been thinking about doing this for a while, so here it is.  My own personal BLOG.  Those of you who really know me know this will probably wear off after a few days and I'll quit posting to it, and it will just sit here with 2 posts and never be thought of again.  But I'm hoping that won't happen.  Anyway, I decided to do this because lots of people are doing it, and my thoughts can't be any more boring that most of those people.  I've always loved sharing what my buddy JT calls "War Stories."  Well, this could turn out to be the start of my book that I keep joking I'll write someday.  I'll be posting some interesting stories, and probably some not so interesting ones about my day to day life.  I'll probably also get off on some rants about random dumb stuff too.  I'm not promising any of this will be good reading, but it might be worth checking on now and then.  If you want to drop some feedback, the address is ryanwcap@aol.com.

        Nothing like quoting Skynyrd.  Well, it’s been a while since I’ve posted anything, so I figured I’d take some time while on the bus on the way home from a game in Springfield to get something down.  Today was probably the most boring game we’ll see this year, but that’s what happens when both teams are playing their 4th game in 5 days.    Anyway, let’s go back about a week and get you updated.  This may take a while, so get comfortable.  You’ll remember I was sick for about a week, with little to no voice for most of that.  We went to Philly last Thursday, stayed until Saturday and the team played there Friday night.  Protecting my frail voice, I really didn’t even get to leave the hotel for most of the trip.  I called the game Friday night, and was pretty much out of gas before the third period even started.  Saturday I went to lunch with my mom and dad who were in town.  Then we all went to Hershey for a hockey game.  The voice was getting stronger, but at the same time, I was getting a nasty cold.    Meanwhile, at the game, my parents were getting to experience the minor celebrity that comes with my job.  They were hanging out near the Lock Monsters Booster Club, which had come down to see the game.  Wearing their LM gear drew the attention of the Boosters, who soon found out who they were.  They really seemed to get a kick out of it.  After the game, mom and dad took me down to my aunt Dana’s house so we could go to the Eagles game in Philly on Sunday.  We had a great time, I got to see the new stadium, which is really cool, and I yelled a bit more than I probably should have, but what do you expect?  Flew home on Sunday night, and met a girl on the plane who works in Boston at this swanky hotel I’ve never heard of.  She offerred to get me a discount sometime.  So that was last weekend.  This week, I started to lose the cold, my voice came almost all the way back, and I abused my body some more with drinking and travel.  Wednesday night, I drove myself to Worcester for a game, then left right after to head to Jersey for Thanksgiving.  I got to my “Weird Aunt” Kay’s house a little after 2am.  She was happy to hear that she’s know on the radio show as my “weird Aunt.”  That tells you something about her right there.  So she and I and my cousin and his wife stayed up until close to 6am sitting around the fire pit in her back yard.  We even toasted marshmallows and hot dogs by the fire.  Needless to say, I was a zombie for most of Thanksgiving day.  I woke up at 10am, thanks to my cousin’s 1 year old son coming in to check out my room.  (By the way, what do I call my cousin’s son?  It’s not my nephew, maybe second cousin?  I’ll have to check on that.)  Anywho, great dinner with the family – my parents, aunt, cousins and wives, etc.  I took 3 naps during the day and after dinner, and was still dead tired.  Felt better in the morning though, and it was a good thing.    Friday I drove about 45 minutes into PA for my friend John’s wedding.  I had to skip out on a hockey game to be there, which felt really weird.  It’s the first time I’ve ever missed any game for any reason since I started calling games in high school.  I confess, I did call the arena to get an update on the score one time.  John being the first of our college buddies to get married, I figured it would be a pretty good party.  The wedding was great.  The priest who performed the ceremony was very casual, cracked a few jokes, kept it entertaining.  Good thing, since it clocked in at over an hour.  Then we went to the reception.  Now, the transportation was provided for everyone.  We had 2 shuttles from the hotel to the church, then the church to the reception, and then back to the hotel.  Great idea.  Problem was, the drivers were incompetant.  They had no idea where they were going.  From the church to the reception we got lost, and our driver had to stop at a gas station and ask directions.  Took twice as long to get there as it should have.  The people on the shuttle were just viscious making jokes about the guy, which I enjoyed immensely.  Reception was jumping… good band with a 3 piece horn section, great food, all very well planned.  All my buddies together again, kicking back with an open bar.  Unfortunately, no beer pong was played, but several of us did try to figure out how we could pull it off with round tables and nothing but coffee cups and wine glasses.  If you don’t know what beer pong is, ask a college student.  We all went back to the hotel bar afterward until they kicked us out.  It was close to 3am when I got to bed.  I had to get up at 8:30 Saturday and drive home for a game that night.  You can guess how good I felt.  I got through the game last night, and another one today, though, and that gets us back to here.  Sitting on a bus on the Mass Pike moving about 5 miles per hour, thanks to traffic. I’m finally almost back to 100 percent, except for the nagging cough which won’t go away.    All in all, two pretty darn good weekends though.  And I was able to work it around my job, which is cool.  That’s the one drawback to what I do, zero free time on the weekends.  I’ve had to skip out on weddings, funerals, family reunions, holidays, you name it.  Finally taking a day off for an important event felt good.  But I still probably won’t do it much.  It’s the price you pay for having a cool job.  Most of the time your job has to come before everything else.  It’s not a good character trait, but it’s necessary if this is what you want to do in life.  It’s one of the things I always tell college kids when they call me for advice on how to get into the business.  I tell them “don’t expect to have a life, but that’s fine, because chances are you won’t be able to afford one.”  I’m going to stop whining now, cause I do have the coolest job of anyone I know, and I try to keep reminding myself of that any time I feel like I don’t want to go to a game.  Ok, that’s enough for now.  Traffic’s still backed up.  We’re never getting home.  I hate the bus.

        Day Four: Ryan's voice held hostage.  I'm actually improving, but still not up to par.  I still have about 54 hours before I need to be on the air.    Anyway, I'm sitting here not talking, watching some West Wing reruns on Bravo, when I came across a fascinating commercial.  "Everyone loves donuts, but no one likes cooking with all that fat."  Excuse me?  Who's cooking their own donuts?  Apparently lots of people are, because there's now a device that looks remarkably like a cupcake pan, where you can bake your own donuts.  And they're fabulous.  It even comes with a jelly injector, if that's your thing.  Again, I ask, who's taking the time to make their own donuts.  Is there anywhere in America you can live without being able to pick up a donut within about five minutes of your house?  Hey, wanna go get some donuts?  Nah, let's play Krispy Kreme: The Home Game.

        So, many of you will remember the car accident I was involved in early this year.  I was found to be at fault, since the other driver that caused the accident was never found.  I appealed that decision, and it was overturned.  So now I'm not at fault.  Done deal.  Uh huh.  I get my car insurance bill in the mail, and it reflects a nice healthy increase in my premium.  So I call them a couple weeks ago, and the guy says, "Well it's because of that accident you were in."  I told him it was overturned, and I'm not at fault.  "Well, according to the info we have, you are."  So I fax him the judgment order and wait.  Never hear back.  Now my money is due pretty soon, so I call them again last Friday and the woman looks into my file and says, "Yeah, you sent us something."  I ask if my cost has been adjusted, and she says, "No.  There's a problem.  The notice you sent us has the wrong date."  And there it is.    They've got an accident that happened in January 2003 listed as July 3, 2002.  Never underestimate the stupidity of the government.  So my insurance company can't do anything until this is fixed.  Never mind that my insurance company knows that I've never been in an accident before January.  I've got to talk to the Registry and Board of Appeals and get them to fix this.  Except now, I have little to no voice this week.  So I'm on the phone with these people trying to stay calm and avoid yelling at them, which I can't do anyway.  All so some bureaucrat can tell me, I need my supervisor to deal with this, and she's out of the office today.  Great.  Maybe tomorrow.  Maybe my voice will be back so I can tear you a new one tomorrow.  Why does everything have to be so difficult?

        You know, when I lived in Woburn, we had digital cable, and it came with the TV Guide listings built in, so you could find out what was on, and you didn't have to flip around.  Come to think of it, because of the digital signal and number of channels, it took way too long to flip around.  I didn't really miss it.  Now, I'm back to regular ol' cable.  And there's no TV Guide and flipping doesn't take that long.  And so I've re-discovered the joy of flipping.  You stumble on some pretty entertaining things you would never see otherwise.  For instance, tonight.  I'm digging around for something to watch, and I see fishing on ESPN.  Quality counter-programming.  Glad to see ESPN is trying to steal the audience from their friends at Monday Night Football.  I flipped right on by, but had to stop and go back just to check and see if I saw what I thought I saw.  And there it was.  Henry Winkler fly-fishing.  Standing in a river in his hip boots and a fisherman's hat.  Turns out this fishing show is hosted by Deion Sanders, although he's not on this particular trip.  Just narrating.  Well Fonzie is going on and on about the joys of fly-fishing.  How it's analogous to life, and it's a zen thing.  Apparently, he's discovered the secret of life by standing waist deep in water and flinging a lure around trying to catch a trout.  And to think, I go fishing, drink some beer and maybe bring home dinner.  Although, I guess fishing could be an analogy for a man's life.  You go spend your free time getting drunk and trying to get your worm nibbled on, and most of the time you come home empty-handed.

        Well, those who heard the afternoon show today already know, but I'll share.  I woke up yesterday with very little voice left.  Not good when you work in the radio business.  I don't feel that bad, and my throat's not really sore, I just can't talk very well.  So I've been hanging out in the apartment the last 2 days not talking to people.  Fun.  I even had to watch the Eagles-Giants game yesterday in silence.  That was tough.  I'll admit I lost control once and let out whatever kind of yell I could muster when Philly stopped them on 4th and goal.  Anyway, I did have a decent weekend up through Sunday morning.  I had home games on Friday and Saturday, with some post-game activity at the Brewery both nights.  The question of the night among the staff who went out on Saturday was "why do we keep going to the Brewery when nobody particularly likes it there?"  I'd much rather go hang at the Dub or the Old Court.  Even the Shamrock.

        Now I'm not a political person.  But I'm sitting here at midnight, watching C-Span2.  Why?  Because there's a filibuster going on in the Senate.  I took civics and government classes in high school.  I minored in Political Science in college.  And I don't understand this whole thing.  If you haven't followed this, the Democrats don't want to confirm 4 of the President's Federal Judge nominees.  So they talk all night long.  Totally legal, but all it does, I think, is delay the inevitable vote.  What's the point?  Eventually they get around to voting, and these judges get in.  Now, I think there used to be something noble about these things.  It used to be that you had to talk and talk and talk.  (Remember "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"?)Some quick research shows that Strom Thurmond holds the record for just over 24 hours of filibustering (if that's a word).  Now, they set up cots in the hall, and they show up for a half-hour at a time, do their speech, trade off with someone else and go home.  I say, we're paying these idiots... everyone has to be there for the whole thing.  First one to give up and leave loses.  You can break to give everyone 5 minutes to go to the bathroom every couple hours.  Or not.  Then it gets really interesting.  This is a full-service blog, so if you want to learn about filibusters, visit your local library, or check out the filibuster page from the  urlLink Senate website .  But as I'm watching this, one of the arguments is that one of these judges is bad for women, and is apparently in favor of breast cancer.  Now, I came in late, but, in favor of breast cancer?  This judge hates women, doesn't support women's rights and hopes they all get cancer.  One problem... the judge is a WOMAN.  Um, doesn't that hinder your argument a bit?  You're telling me this woman thinks she shouldn't have any rights?  This all boils down to one thing.  Politicians like to hear themselves talk.  It's all about spewing the bullshit.  There's nothing useful getting done for 30 hours.  And we're paying for this.

        Ever wonder how great it is to be famous?  Yeah, there's drawbacks like living in expensive houses and finding the right butler.  But if there was ever a reason to be famous, I saw it tonight.  I'm flipping around on TV, and I stumbled onto "Celebrities UNcensored" on E!.  They showed a clip of Emmanuel Lewis outside some place where he was signing autographs and posing for pictures.  You remember Emmanuel... he was "Webster" on TV, and hasn't done anything famous since 1987.  According to  urlLink imdb.com  he's 3-foot-4, and he's 32 years old, but still looks like he's 6.  Except he's put on a few pounds recently.  So he's posing for a picture with this nice looking girl, and he whips out the cell phone and gets her number!  FREAKIN' WEBSTER!  Now I try to put myself in her position.  You've got the chance to hook up with a celebrity.  But how do you tell anybody without them thinking of you as a total ho?  From his point of view... GO WEBSTER!  Cash in on that fame from 15 years ago!  I've got to get famous.  If Webster's getting action, anyone can.

        From our friends at  urlLink www.spam.com :  "We do not object to use of this slang term to describe UCE, although we do object to the use of the word "spam" as a trademark and to the use of our product image in association with that term. Also, if the term is to be used, it should be used in all lower-case letters to distinguish it from our trademark SPAM, which should be used with all uppercase letters."  So I apologize to them for not capitalizing it in my previous posts.  It's not Spam, it's SPAM!  As if I'm shouting it from the rooftop.  SPAM!  Like it's Emeril kicking it up a notch.  Notice Mom got it right though.  And if memory serves, SPAM was not allowed in her house when she was a kid.  A bit more info, what the hell is this stuff anyway?

        My mom wanted me to know this, so I figured I share it with the rest of the class:  "By the way, regarding your blogspot comments, SPAM (the canned meat kind) is big in Hawaii. They actually serve it in the finer restaurants, prepared lots of different ways, at least on Maui, for lunch. Probably has something to do with shelf life, shipping, etc."  Yum.  Excuse me, I've got to head to the grocery store.  I'm making Spam and Pineapple Casserole for dinner.

        I was beginning to wonder if anybody reads this thing, or whether it was just here to entertain myself (and my mom).  I got my first feedback Tuesday.  (See the comment below the Spam rant)  Quick note back... I gave thought to Veterans' Day today, but how long was I supposed to concentrate on it?  Is it wrong to think about anything else on Veterans' Day?  I'm not sure my hockey audience would have appreciated me ignoring the game and discussing World War II all afternoon.  But now, JC - this one's for you... let's raise a glass to all the Vets out there, thanks for everything.   Also, Happy Birthday to my Dad.  Sorry I didn't get to talk to you today, but I hope you took the day off and enjoyed it.

        Getting ready for the game today, I just saw a commercial that made me stop everything and make sure I got this on here before I forgot.  Spam is advertising on TV.  No, not the crappy e-mails you get about making your penis bigger while giving you better mortgage rates.  I'm talking the canned ham-like substance.  SPAM!  It was an intentionally campy commercial, but even so.  I thought it was some kind of joke, all the way up until the end.  Waiting for the Energizer bunny or the Geico "I just saved 15 percent on my car insurance" line to pop up.  Didn't happen.  It was a real commercial.  All I could think for the next 4 minutes was "You've gotta be F-ing kidding me."  Hell of a way to start the day.

        Gotta give a shout to my buddy JT.  He did some serious investigative reporting this week.  Quick backstory.  There was this guy at SU who worked on Orangewomen basketball games after we graduated.  Rumors were, he had hooked up with a then-member of the team.  We had no confirmation on this.  Well, she turned up recently at JT's school as a coach.  That got us wondering again.  Now, neither one of us knows her, so he couldn't exactly go introduce himself and start quizzing her about her past.  So JT went straight to the horse's mouth, or at least to his Instant Messenger.  Turns out, not only did they hook up, but she dumped him, and (according to him) she's no longer a fan of guys, if you get my drift.  Bombshell.  Mike Wallace couldn't have dug up the story any better.  Great work, JT.  Outstanding.  Kept me entertained all day Tuesday.

        I've spent a fair amount to time recently playing my first season as the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles on Madden 2004.  Owner mode is sweet.  You set ticket prices, parking prices, merchandising, you can build a new stadium, fire coaches, sign free agents, draft, etc.  You can do this for up to 20 seasons.  Then of course you play the games with your team.  Big fan of the game, and I'm hoping to make the Eagles a dynasty with Donovan McNabb at the helm.    But they still have one problem with these games, and it's one that's existed ever since they started making video games.  Once in a while, the computer decides it needs to win.  And so it does.  And it totally rips you off in the process.  Suddenly, the computer will intercept 4 straight passes, or your running back will fumble twice in a row, when he hasn't fumbled twice all year.  I was playing the other day, and the computer scored 28 points in the last 2:15 of the game for a miracle comeback victory.  When's the last time that happened in real football?  I think they do it to keep you from getting bored winning every game, but it just pisses me off and I don't play for three days after.  I think I may be taking this way too seriously.  When my neighbors start complaining because they hear me swearing at the Playstation, I'll seek help.

        I'm relaxing this morning, catching some more of one of the greatest series ever,  urlLink I Love The 80's (Strikes Back) .  They were showing that show Doogie Howser, M.D.  I liked that show when I was a kid, but then I never really thought about how ridiculous it was that there was a 15 year old doctor working at the hospital.  Anywho, at the end of the show, Doogie always used to sit at his computer and type out his thoughts.  Bing!  The Blog is born.  We can all be thankful to Doogie.  Neil Patrick Harris never really did escape the Doogie type-casting, did he?  Sad.

        Quick summary of my week... Lock Monsters Live(!) Monday night, Tuesday was "Election Day 2003" which meant not only Afternoon Live but a few hours that night working on election coverage, then the normal post-election coverage trip to the Blue Shamrock for a few beers.  Wednesday brought the Booster Club Pot Luck Supper, and the annual post-pot luck supper trip to the Lo Kai for some Scorpion Bowls.  That didn't bode well considering I had to get up at 5am on Thursday for the Salvation Army Breakfast broadcast.  Sometimes you've got to give till it hurts.  It did.  A nice long nap after that and right back to work.  All this leading into the weekend, where the Lock Monsters were playing 4 games in 5 days.  We're half way through that stretch, which was celebrated at the Brewery last night after the game.  I don't understand why I'm so exhausted.  Can't be the beer.

        Sorry for the lack of updates this week.  It was a combination of a very busy week, total non-motivation and a complete lack of things to say.  When someone asked me yesterday if I'd quit the blog, I realized I should probably put something up here.  As an apology to you, my loyal readers, I'm going on a posting binge this morning.  And I've installed a new feature.  You'll notice at the end of each post a comment link.  You can now post feedback to a public board so we can have discussions.  Doesn't that sound like fun?  Feel free to request topics for me to cover, and I'll be happy to give you my take.

        How entertaining was that video from outside the courthouse where the guy is trying to shoot the lawyer, then walks away and gets tackled by an off-duty cop?  The lawyer is ducking and bobbing and weaving behind the tree while the guy just keeps shooting.  The lawyer wouldn't go down, even though he was shot several times.  But the best part for me is that the shooter empties the gun, then just calmly strolls away.  So does the lawyer.  But the shooter doesn't run, he doesn't try to hit the guy, he doesn't hide.  He just starts walking.  And there happens to be an off-duty cop who runs up from behind and grabs the guy in a chokehold and tackles him.  And all of this just happens to take place outside the Robert Blake trial, so there's TV cameras there to capture the whole thing.  God Bless America.

        I was reading a pretty interesting study this morning.  The doctors have been spending some time in the bar.  The medical community says if you drink out of a short glass, you'll drink more than if you drink out of a tall glass.  It has something to do with the optical illusion that the short glass doesn't hold as much, so people, including bartenders, tend to put more alcohol into the short glass.  I always thought the short drinks were stronger because there was less mixer in them, but apparently, it's because there's just more booze in them.  So from now on, I'd like my rum & cokes in a shot glass, please.   urlLink Here's the story   Other stuff... There's a guy in Maryland who got released from prison after 27 years when his conviction for killing a convenience store clerk was overturned.  Turns out he really didn't do it.  The Governor apologized and said he should probably get some compensation for all the hassle.  You think???  27 years gone?  This guy ought to own half the state by the time he's done.  His attorney obviously didn't care or was a total moron.  The cops were looking for a 5-foot-8 light skinned black man.  This guy is 6-foot-5 and dark skinned.  And to top it off, the guy was at work when the murder happened, which they could have found out just by looking at his time card!  Not exactly Perry Mason here.  That lawyer has died in the years since the trial.  You could probably put him in a courtroom now, and he'd be just as good.  So it got me thinking... how much money would it take to get me to spend the next 27 years in jail?  I'd ask for $270,272,727.27.  Ten million a year ought to do it, thank you, drive through.  Somehow, I don't think this guy will get that.

        Well, seeing as how I’m on the road a few days, and just by the way this trip has started, I’ve decided to keep a running diary of my Christmas trip to New Jersey.  Ah, the joys of travelling during the holiday season.  Flying at Christmas time is like drinking on St. Patrick’s Day – it’s amateur hour.  People who never fly anywhere are suddenly mixed in with the commuters of the world, and chaos ensues.  DEC. 23 6:00am – Alarm goes off.  Snooze button is hit.  6:10am – Alarm goes off again.  Got to get up now.  Shower, finish packing and get ready to go.  6:45am – Headed to Logan Airport, Boston.  I’m leaving ridiculously early because I’m not sure what the traffic will be like in Boston, with the new tunnel just opened and everything.  It could turn out everyone’s taking the day off and I’ll get there fast.    7:25am – Sure enough, traffic pretty much zipped right through.  The new tunnel makes it pretty easy to get to the Airport.  Not sure if it was worth $15 billion though.  7:30am – Trying to locate the Economy Parking lot, which apparently is in Rhode Island.  7:32am – Economy Parking is “full” even though I see a few open spaces as I drive by.    7:36am – In Central Parking, I get a space that’s about 50 feet from the terminal.  Sweet.  If I’m paying full price, at least I don’t have to walk far.  7:40am – Have you tried the automated Check-in kiosks?  First rate.  Swipe a credit card, tell it how many bags you want to check, pick your own seat, everything.  They take your bags and send them off to be lost.  Big fan.  I’m able to score an exit row seat for some extra leg room.  Sweet.  7:43am – I’m already through security.  For December 23rd, the airport is really not busy.  Security doesn’t seem that much tighter either.  I grab a breakfast sandwich and a paper, and hang out.  9:10am – Time to board.  The girl right in front of me hands the gate agent her whole ticket jacket instead of just the boarding pass.  So the agent has to dig into the envelope and find the boarding pass.  Amateurs.  I was behind about 30 people in line, and she’s the only one who didn’t have her boarding pass out and ready to go.  9:15am – Oh, great.  Guess who I’m sitting next to?  That’s right, Ticket Girl.  She’s got the middle between me and some other guy who’s already half asleep.  I’ve done that, it’s a beautiful thing.  Fall asleep before the plane gets moving, wake up when you land.  The only way to fly.  Helps to be hungover or still up from the night before.  9:20am – Well apparently, Ticket Girl not only doesn’t take her boarding pass out, she doesn’t know how to read it either.  She’s in the wrong row.   	Woman: “Excuse me, miss.  You’re in my seat.” 	TG: “I have 8E.” 	Me: “This is row 9.” 	TG: “Oh.” I question how tough it is to find your seat on an airplane.  9:21am – Apparently it’s tougher than I thought.  A guy comes up to me. Guy: “I have 8D.”   Me: “Cool.  That’s right there.” Guy: Puzzled look. Me: “This is row 9.” Guy: “Oh, yeah.”  9:25am – A late arriving passenger is looking for a place to stow his rolling carry-on bag.  He asks a woman across the aisle if he can move her coat so he can put his bag up there.  “Yes,” she says.  “Just make sure your dirty wheels don’t touch it.”  Ugh.  God forbid you might get a little dirt on your coat.  9:31am – As we start to taxi, I notice the man across the aisle is wearing a surgical mask.  Maybe he’s expecting a SARS outbreak on the plane.  It appears he’s also married to the coat lady.  No wonder she didn’t want the dirty bag touching her coat.  Germs.  9:50am – Wheels up on time, no waiting on the runway or anything.  I just realized SARS Man has side burns that would make Elvis proud.  Except his are gray.  I also notice SARS Man’s wife, Coat Lady is coughing up a storm over there.  Maybe he knew what he was doing.  10:35am – Touch down in Philly, way early.  We were at cruising altitude for about 30 seconds.  Landing was a bit rough, felt awfully windy, and at one point I think we were a bit short, because the pilot gunned the engine and had us pointing up instead of down.  The woman next to me, who replaced Ticket Girl, is a pretty nervous flier.  Now, I am too, but I think I hold it together pretty well.  But this woman was making me nervous just because she looked so nervous.  Meanwhile, I check a row ahead, and Ticket Girl is asleep.  Maybe she wouldn’t have been so bad after all.  10:41am – We arrive at the gate 20 minutes early.  Which, the pilot informs us, means no one is there to direct us into our parking spot.    10:45am – We successfully navigate the 10 remaining feet.  The flight attendant announces that there’s now no one there to drive the jetway to the door.    10:51am – I offer to jump the gap and give it a shot.  I sit and listen to Coat Lady and SARS Man.  Or actually, just to Coat Lady, as SARS Man doesn’t really say anything.  She busts out the cell phone and calls whoever is waiting to pick her up.  They don’t answer and she leaves a nagging message.  “I toolllld you to make sure your phone was on.”  Not once, but twice in the space of a minute she does this.  I secretly hope they overslept and she has to take a cab wherever she’s going.  Although that would probably kill SARS Man.  I’m starting to feel really bad for him now, having to live with this woman.  She seems to be one of these people who has to explain everything.  She tells him about how good her carry-on bag is, because it fits right under the seat.  “So when we go back, we can just put it right under the seat like that.”  SARS Man has removed the mask now that we’re on the ground.  But we’ve been stuck on the plane for 10 minutes since then, but he’s confident the health crisis has been averted.  10:53am – Finally they let us off the plane.  11:05am – Waiting at the baggage claim, my prayers go unanswered, as Coat Lady’s dad shows up to pick her up.  He’s wandering around the airport looking for her, she’s calling him, he seems to be deaf.  My bag arrives, which if you know me, is a bonafide Christmas miracle.  Dad picks me up and we head out.  11:10am – Mom and Aunt Kay are out doing some shopping, so we’re going to get some cheesesteaks.  As we drive past the Eagles practice facility, we notice they’re practicing, so we stop to see if we can get in.  But they don’t let the public in to watch.  So we pull up next to the fence to peep in.  They have these bushes to keep people from watching.  Seriously, they don’t guard our nuclear secrets as well as the Eagles practices.  11:45am – Pat’s Steaks, in South Philly.  As we drive there, Dad and I marvel at the number of cheesesteak and hoagie places we pass.  There’s at least one on every block.  No wonder Philly always ranks up there with the fattest cities in America.  12:35pm – We have made our way into NJ, and visit the discount liquor warehouse.  We spend way too much on booze.  Our family may have a problem.  3:00pm – Nap time.  Zzzzzz.  It was at this point I decided to stop the time-keeping, so the rest will just be thrown together.  That night we went back to South Philly for dinner at a restaurant that would make the Sopranos proud.  It’s right in the middle of this neighborhood full of row houses, a nice little Italian restaurant.  It’s the kind of place you’d expect to have a room in the back where the owners are having a “meeting” with someone who owes them money.  Unbelieveable food.  They even served these roasted carrots with oil and balsamic vinegar as an appetizer instead of just the bread with dipping sauce.  Top notch all the way.  I ate way too much.  Even though we were all stuffed, we then roamed the neighborhood looking for a bakery so we could get canolis.  Hung out for a while with the family when we got back, and the canolis were excellent.  DEC. 24 Not a whole lot to report.  Kind of a boring day around the house.  My parents dog decided to wake me up this morning, shortly after coming in from the rain.  So I had a wet dog push through the closed door and jump up on the bed to make sure I didn’t sleep through any fun.  The family decorated the tree in late afternoon, and we had the yearly viewing of “Christmas Vacation.”  We had our annual crab legs dinner with hors d’oervres following.  I ate way too much of course.  Several kinds of shrimp, jalepeno poppers, bourbon hot dogs, swedish meatballs, etc.  My cousin Rick the Pyro started a fire in the back yard fire-pit.  We huddled around it and finished off a lot of the beer and champagne.  I went to bed around 2, as Santa was coming and we had a 9am wakeup call for presents.   DEC. 25 Shortly after waking up, Dad and I started on the Whiskey Sours.  Dad apparently messed up the recipe this year, as they were fairly drinkable.  He added too much OJ.  By the way, for posterity, here’s the recipe: 3 parts whiskey, 2 parts OJ, 1 part lemon juice.  Use with caution.  Presents were opened, I got everything I asked for, so it was a good Christmas.  Then the family started showing up around 11-12.  12 of us for Christmas brunch, which is my favorite meal of the year.  Filet mignon on the grill, with egg casserole and english muffins.  It’s another Johnston family tradition.  Again, I ate way too much.  Sensing a pattern here?  Some of the family headed out for other events, some of us took a nap in the afternoon.  A prime rib for dinner with roasted potatoes.   Think I ate too much?  You bet.  Mom and Dad, Aunt Kay and I hung out after dinner drinking a bottle of Bailey’s.  Everyone exhausted, the party broke up before midnight.  That’s an early night in comparison to a normal night at Kay’s.  I go in and pack my bag full of clothes and as many of my presents as will fit (my parents are shipping me the rest).  DEC. 26 Up early for the flight back.  Get to the airport very quickly, as no one is working today, so there’s no traffic.  I check in at the automatic kiosk, snag another exit row seat, and head up for the security checkpoint.  I get up there, and go to get on line, only to be told, “The end of the line is back there.”  Approximately in Harrisburg.  It was just like the scene in “A Christmas Story” where the kids are going to see Santa.  So as I’m walking across the skywalk toward the end of the line, I look across to the other skywalk and see nobody in there.  Now, knowing the Philly airport, I know there’s another checkpoint over there and all the terminals connect anyway, so I decide to hustle over and see what the wait is like.  5 minutes later, I’m already through security.  Sometimes it pays to fly on Amateur Day.  When people don’t know what they’re doing, you can outsmart them.  I grab a breakfast sandwich and sit down at the gate to type up all this stuff.    Unfortunately, the flight back does not feature nearly as many characters as the first one.  There’s only one that really stands out.  Too Big Carry-on Guy.  In this case, his wife is an accomplice, because both have bags too big to wedge into the overhead.  Plus, this guy jumped the gun on the boarding process, so me and about 40 people who are sitting behind him have to wait while he tries and tries to get his bag up there.  Then his wife hands him another one.  Honestly, we need the death penalty for things like this.  On the way off the flight, once again, the entire plane has to wait for him to try to somehow get his oversized bags out of the overhead.  If there’s no death penalty, they ought to at least make the guy wait right outside the door of the plane so everyone can slap him.  At the baggage claim, not only does my bag show up, it’s the first one out.  I only wish that would happen when playing carousel roulette.  If you’re not familiar, everyone throws money into the pot, and the first person whose bag comes out wins the money.  Nice way to liven up the wait.  So there you have it, my holidays.  Now back to the grind, with 7 games in the next 9 days.  Happy Freakin’ New Year.

        I've been reading about a planned event, most likely on pay-per-view coming in 2004.  "Battle of the Hockey Gladiators."  The idea is to get 64 hockey goons of various skill levels to compete in an on-ice fight tournament for $50,000.  They've got two former NHL players involved, but they're expecting most of the fighters to be juniors, amateurs and low level minor leaguers.  Now, as our fans know, I love a good hockey fight, but even I'm trying to figure out how this can work.  First, the beauty of a hockey fight is that it can happen at any time.  Very rarely do you see it coming.  Guys get angry, they drop the gloves, it's over in about 30 seconds and the crowd's immediately into the game.  They're putting a 2 minute limit on these fights.  And they'll have judges there to determine the winners.  No way these guys can fight hard for 2 minutes, and then have to fight again and again and again.  They're going to be totally wiped out after the second fight.  You ever see two players after a good go-round?  They're useless for the next 10 minutes at least.  Plus, remember, this is basically bare-knuckled boxing we're talking about.  How many of those fights can you get into in one night before you're drooling and slurring your words?  Does fighting in hockey have its place?  Yes.  It's got a nobility to it most times.  A guy standing up for his teammate when the opponent is taking liberties.  A guy trying to fire up his team, or the crowd.  It's not some glorified toughman contest on skates.  Shame on Tony Twist for getting involved in this thing.

        Is there any celebrity whose attractiveness varies as much as Uma Thurman?  I'm watching her on Leno tonight, and she looks really good.  It seems like half the time I see her she looks pretty hot, and the other half she looks absolutely terrible.  Never in between.  Check out some pictures of her some time.  It's mind-boggling.  At least to me.

        The latest dumb thing being sold on tv today... the "Smart Scissors."  If you haven't seen it, it's not that bad an idea.  It's this machine that cuts through fabric like butter.  Would probably be pretty handy for people who sew.  But the commercial is so stupid.  First, it shows how easy it is to cut a piece of paper.  Now, I don't do a lot of arts and crafts, but I'm pretty sure paper cuts fairly easily.  Then, they act like you might kill yourself if you use a pair of real scissors.  It shows this woman reacting like she just cut her hand, and then shows a pair of scissors POPPING A BALLOON!  My god, somebody better call the government.  How can they be allowed to sell such a dangerous product?  Why do these commercials always have to be made to insult or intelligence?  And why is it if you order now, you always get 2 of whatever you ordered?  Do you really need 2 sets of these things?  Maybe if you're running a tailoring shop.

        Well, since John McD wanted to see this in print somewhere... I'm going to violate my rule of taking care of show related business on this site, and talk about a show topic.  In the last half-hour Tuesday, we discussed whether it's appropriate for a listener to call a host at home during their off time.  I think it's ridiculous that anyone would even think of looking up someone's home phone number and calling them off the air to chat about whatever.  Again, as I did on the show, let me stress, this has not happened to me, nor do I think it will.  There's a reason why I don't have a listed phone number.  But it has happened to several people I work with.    Let's look at it with this hypothetical.  You've been going to a dry cleaner for a few years.  When you go in there, you always make polite conversation with the dry cleaner.  You talk about current events, the weather, what have you.  So then, you're sitting at home one night, and you decide, "You know, that dry cleaner's an awfully nice guy.  I should give him a call."  Now, the dry cleaner talks to you at work, but he doesn't really know you.  You're not his friend, you're a customer.  If you look up his number in the phone book and call him out of the blue, chances are he's going to be more than a little creeped out.  Well, it's the same thing with radio people.  At least, most of us.    I feel comfortable in saying the majority of us don't want to be called at home to discuss issues that we normally talk about during the show.  Some people may not want to publicly admit it, but it's true.  Now, obviously, it depends on the person.  There are people I know who listen to the show, and I'm completely comfortable talking with them outside of a work environment.  (And, for example, if Alyssa Milano happens to be listening, please feel free to call me any time.)  Anyway, the same as that dry cleaner, there's a difference between work time and private time.  As I said during the show, I think it's incredibly inappropriate to call a radio host at home.  And from what I hear, not only do some people do it, but they do it at fairly late times.  You need to control yourselves, people.  If you want to talk to George or Regina, you have from 6 to 9 am to do it.  If you want to talk to Gary, John or me, you have from 4 to 7 pm to do it.  I don't call the dry cleaner at home.  You shouldn't call us at home.  I don't think that's an unfair request.

        First off, the Eagles won tonight, so I'm pretty fired up.  But, I have a few things to gripe about.  First, another friggin' snow storm.  On the day of a road game no less.  It took the team bus an hour and 15 minutes to get to Providence yesterday, and more than twice that to get back.  And you know how I feel about traveling on the bus in the snow.  If you don't, look down the page a bit.  I didn't feel like typing out a blog entry, so I listened to music and played some computer solitaire to keep my mind busy.  And this storm was worse, because it wasn't just snow.  Snow, sleet, rain, wind, everything.  It put a nice solid sheet of ice on everything.  And to top it all off, I got back to my apartment after the trip and there were no parking spaces left.  And of course, during a snow storm, there's no parking on the streets.  So I had to hang out for about 10 minutes while this dude dug his car out to go somewhere.  Heck of a night.  The other thing is my cell phone.  I got it this past spring, and it's been great so far.  No problems, no concerns.  I even dumped my real phone and just use the cell for everything now.  However, tonight there was a problem.  I called my buddy JT and he couldn't hear me.  I figured it was just a bad connection.  I called him back.  Still couldn't hear me.  I thought maybe his cell phone sucked.  Tried again, still no dice.  So I gave up.  I then tried to call and order chinese food and they could hear me either.  I looked through the User Guide for my phone and couldn't find anything to help me.  It doesn't even have a troubleshooting section.  I tried a bunch of things and then just shut the phone off.  Let it reboot, just like my computer.  Turned it back on and everything was good for a while.  Then I was talking to Mom and in the middle of the conversation, she suddenly couldn't hear me either.  So I shut the phone down again, and eventually tried it again, and now it works.  Lord knows for how long.  Hopefully it's nothing serious, or at least is covered by warranty.  I really don't want to buy a new phone.

        In case you haven't seen, we caught Saddam this morning.  By the look of him, I think he's going to audition to join the Grateful Dead.  And I say "we caught him" even though I wasn't there when it happened.  In fact, I'll admit I didn't really contribute anything to the search, except to say I was pretty sure he wasn't hiding out in my apartment.  But then, nobody asked me if he was either.

        When I decided to put the counter in on this page to see how many people were looking at it, I had no idea what fun I'd have.  You see, the counter I chose not only counts how many hits my page gets, but it also breaks them down by how they came to the site (bookmark, afternoonlive.com, google, etc.) as well as where they're from and who their internet provider is.  I didn't know about any of this before I put the counter on.  But I've spent the last 2 days analyzing the results.  Some people seem to be listeners, lots of Boston area, 1 in New Hampshire.  Some of you people should use your work time a bit more productively.  A few people were just random heads who stumbled in via google or my blog service.  I had three visitors from overseas... 1 from Italy, 1 from Singapore and 1 from Beirut, Lebanon.  Hope they enjoyed the page and come back soon.  Noticed some friends and family if I'm not mistaken.   And I can also play little games to see what I can do to the numbers.  For instance, I didn't update for the last two days in part so I could see how long it would take for my hits to go down (didn't take long).  And I also wanted to see how many times people would check the page during the day to see if it had been updated yet.  Some of you are awfully persistent.  I'll keep that in mind, and to quench your thirst for knowledge of all things Ryan, I'll try to update a little more often if I can.

        On Fox News Channel this morning, they were talking about NJ starting up bear season.  I learned a few things from the report that I thought I'd share.  There have been more than 50 bears that have broken into houses in New Jersey this year.  Now, maybe I'm underestimating a bear's intelligence, but how exactly does this happen?  Can't you pretty much keep a bear out of your house by keeping the doors shut?  And even if the bear could open the door... if you lock it, I'm pretty sure he doesn't have a key.  I lived 13 years in New Jersey, and I never remember hearing problems about bears running rampant.  So anyway, there's some bear overpopulation problems in Jersey, and they decided the best way to deal with that was allowing hunters to kill some.  Makes sense to me.  Of course the animal lovers are out protesting it.  But the most surprising thing of all came when they were discussing other ways to deal with this problem.  Apparently, there's no FDA-approved contraceptive for bears!  Does the FDA really do testing on bear birth control?  And are they turning these things down?  If so, why?  It's not like it's for cows and you have to worry about people eating the cow and getting poisoned by the drug.  Although, now since they're letting the bears get hunted, I'm assuming some of them are getting eaten.  So maybe the FDA was onto something.  Those darn bears will just have to go on wearing condoms, I guess, until someone gives them the pill.

        I can't tell you how much I don't like snow.  People from the south, or who used to live up north, then moved away always talk about how much they love snow.  "I miss it so much."  Bull.  Move back up here and deal with a foot and a half and tell me again how much you love it.  It's a pain in the ass.  Bet you'd really like it to be 15 degrees with a wind chill below zero too.  And why do people forget how to drive once a few flakes hit the ground?  Not that people in Massachusetts aren't awful drivers anyway.  And I'm not talking about skidding on ice or anything like that.  They just forget simple things, like don't stop for no reason.  Last night, heavy traffic moving through Lowell, but moving along well.  The guy two cars in front of me decides to stop and let a car turn left in front of him.  Slippery roads nearly caused a 37 car pileup because of him.  A little advice.  Just go.  So anyway, back to this weekend.  We ended up having to camp out in Hartford all weekend.  And since it was snowing and blowing, I was pretty much confined to the hotel the whole time.  As someone in Manchester put it, "I spent a week in Hartford one night."  I didn't need insurance, so the trip was kind of a bust.  The worst thing was there's a mall attached to the hotel and the arena, and all the stores decided to be closed all weekend due to the storm.  So I couldn't even burn time shopping.  Fortunately, the roads weren't all that bad on Sunday, so the bus didn't have a tough time getting to Providence or home after the game.  Digging the car out was fun too, since it was buried under all that snow, and the parking lot at the arena hadn't been plowed yet.  Enough griping.  Let's move on to other things.

        So I'm getting ready for bed, but not quite tired enough yet, when I got it in my head to try to add a new feature to this thing.  I've now got a counter, which can be seen by clicking the icon all the way down the bottom of the page.  This could work 2 ways.  It could be a huge ego boost to see lots of people are checking this page out on a regular basis.  Or, I could find out it's just me and my mom who look at this thing.  Oh, by the way, I made it back safely through the blizzard.  More on that tomorrow.

        I’m on the bus on the way to Hartford as I type this time.  It’s just after 11:30. We’re playing there tomorrow, and we decided to drive down tonight after the game in Manchester with hopes of beating the worst of the snow storm that’s headed up the coast.  To tell you something about me, I’ve always been pretty nervous about riding on the bus.  It’s pretty much like flying.  Or, come to think of it, just riding in a car as a passenger.  I’m not in control.  I don’t like trusting other people to get me places.  That’s part of the reason I’ve never slept well on the bus.  Instinctively, every time we swerve a little, or hit a bump, my subconscious thinks we’re going over a cliff or something.  That’s part of the reason I decided to start typing.  I figured that maybe it would distract me from the trip and keep my nerves calm for a while.  So this will probably end up being a long, rambling posting.  As far as flying goes, I’ve always thought that if I learned to fly, I’d handle flying a little better.  Just knowing what is going on the cockpit would help soothe me a little.  I used to like flying on little puddle jumpers back when they could keep the cockpit door open.  I’d try to sit in the first row, so I could check out what was going on.  That really helped to see that the pilots weren’t panicking when we hit turbulence.  Now, of course, they have to lock those doors and the pilots are armed, so I have to suffer.  Damn terrorists.    So anyway, we’re driving down through some snow tonight.  I really hate riding on the bus in bad weather.  You don’t have to deal with it during baseball season.  Maybe a little rain once in while, that’s all.  But a few times a year during hockey season we have to travel in the type of conditions that the people on the news talk about and remind people, “If you don’t need to travel tonight, don’t.”  I always love to hear that before we hop on the bus for a few hours.  We seem to be making good time, so hopefully this won’t be too rough a trip.  All I know is that it was snowing in Hartford at 4:15 today when I checked the radar,  and I’m assuming it’s been snowing since then.  Worse case scenario is we’ll get down there and the game will get cancelled because they’ve got too much snow and the city is shutting down.  That almost happened when we went to Hartford a year or two ago.  There was a pretty good snow storm hitting the Northeast, and they went back and forth all afternoon trying to decide whether we’d get to play.  Finally, by the time they were ready to postpone the game, we were already on our way there.  So we ended up going down there and playing in front of an empty arena.  I doubt they’d cancel the game with us already in town, but you never know.  The Governor might declare a state of emergency or something.  I don’t care if they cancel the game, just so long as we don’t have to make it up on Super Bowl Sunday.  That happened a few years ago.  Try getting fans to a hockey game at 1pm on that day.  No chance.  On the plus side, it’s an extra day away from home, which because of the schedule, we don’t have too many of this year.  Now, don’t get me wrong, I love playing at home.  I can get to the arena as early as I want, give myself plenty of time to get things done, etc.  But my game preparation is always much better when we get to stay in a hotel the day of the game.  There’s a lot less distractions.  The TV’s usually got about 8 channels, so there’s not much to watch there.  I don’t have to deal with station stuff from the road, so I can just concentrate on the game.  I don’t know many people at the arena, so I don’t get to talking to them too long, like at home.  Plus, there’s no chance of the bus getting stuck in traffic and getting to the arena late, forcing me to rush everything leading up to the broadcast.  That happens at least a few times each season.  I’m also sitting here trying to come up with some sort of Christmas list for my parents.  I’m having a real hard time this year.  Problem is, when I need something or really want something, I go buy it.  Whether I can afford it or not.  So I’ve been looking around my apartment, trying to come up with stuff that would be cool to have, but I haven’t gotten yet.  I’ve even checked out a few stores, and saw a couple things that would be cool, but then I thought, “I’ll never use that.”  It used to be a lot easier when I was a kid, and I’d see a commercial, and go, “I want that.”  End of story.  Don’t care how much it costs, or if I’ll use it twice and then it goes in the basement.  The one thing I really do need is a CD burner for my computer.  I’ve got so much audio from games and interviews and stuff on my computer, it’s eating up all my space.  So that went on the list right away.  And I’ve got some Playstation2 games on there.  (Yes, I AM 27 years old, why do you ask?)  Some DVD’s and such.  But that’s about it.  Of course, I’ll get some clothes, which is always good.  Mom and Dad are usually pretty good at picking out nice-looking golf shirts for me.  If anyone has any suggestions on what else I want for Christmas, be sure to drop me a line, or post a comment.    We’re passing through Worcester now, by the way, and it’s now just after midnight.  I’m interested to see who gets to Hartford first, us or the Wolf Pack.  They were playing in Portland, Maine tonight, which is a longer drive, but their game began a half-hour before ours.  We may end up seeing them on I-84 somewhere.  I’ve got to tell you, one of my greatest purchases ever is my MP3 player.  It’s got a 20 Gig hard drive on it.  If you don’t know what that means, it’s BIG.  More storage space on there than my whole laptop.  I’ve got about 2000 songs on there, hours worth of comedy stuff, plus some files from my computer, and the thing’s only about half full.  It’s great for these trips when nobody remembered to bring a movie, or it’s too late for a movie because most of the team is sleeping.  In tonight’s case, it’s the former.  But I can put on my headphones and listen to pretty much any song I’ve ever liked.  It’s great for long drives too.  The battery tends to last about 8 hours per charging.  Last weekend when I went down to NJ/PA for Thanksgiving and the wedding, I hooked it up in my car and just let it play.  The songs are broken down by type too.  So for a while, I listened to some Beatles, then some Sinatra, then just a random mix of 90’s and current stuff, then all 80’s.  It’s pretty sweet.  If you travel a lot and have some time to invest in getting the music onto it, I highly recommend getting one.  That was the biggest pain, was getting the music on it to begin with.  I had lots of downloaded music on the computer already, and it’s easy to move that stuff over.  But the CD’s took time.  I’ve got about 150-200 CD’s, and I had to take time with each one, to burn on to the computer the songs I wanted, then move them into the player.  It was quite a project.  But once that’s done, you’ve got everything you want at your fingertips.  Well, this has done a nice job of taking my mind off the trip.  We’re on the Mass Pike now, and things don’t look very bad at all.  I’m going to attempt to take a nap now, and fail.  Thanks for keeping me company.          -- RJ

        I'm checking out the "Celebrity Poker Showdown" on Bravo tonight, and I've got to say, I'd love to get a bankroll and get these people together for a game.  Five actors, and none of them are any good.  The guy who won (who barely qualifies as a celeb, but more on that in a second) was the luckiest person I've ever seen.  He just kept calling with nothing, and he'd draw ridiculous cards.  I swear, he's never played poker before.    The other thing about this show, in the intro, they're telling you who's playing tonight, and something strikes me.  I always feel bad for "celebrities" who have to have a credit before their name so people know who they are.  The announcer says, "David Schwimmer, Ben Affleck, from 'CSI Miami' Emily Proctor."  It's got to be a little humiliating to be on a show with "celebrity" in the title, and have Ben Affleck sitting at the same table, and they have to explain to people who you are.  I feel bad for them, then I remember that even though people don't really know who they are, they make 20 times what I do, and suddenly I'm glad they get humiliated.  They should do it to all of them.  "He won an Oscar for Good Will Hunting and has done nothing but crap ever since... Ben Affleck!"  I'm not bitter though.

        Sometimes sleeping in leads to surprises.  I woke up around 9:15 this morning, and I'm going about my normal AM activities.  Check the AOL Weather Box, and it's got 27 degrees (ugh) but the little sunshine symbol is there.  After about 20 minutes, I called the station to take care of a little business and our office manager says, "I'm going crazy with these phones."  Now, that leads me to think there's something wrong with the phones.  But no, she says, "have you been outside yet?"  "No."  I look out my window, and it's a stinkin' BLIZZARD!  Grass is pretty much totally covered, as are the streets apparently.  Winter is here people.

        I just got back from the bank.  Not my bank, mind you, but a bank nonetheless.  I had to get quarters for laundry, so I stopped by a bank that was a few minutes closer than mine.  I go to the drive up window, and ask to buy a roll of quarters.  "Do you have an account with us?" the girl asks.  "Yep," I say.  This is a lie.  But it's one of those lies that doesn't really hurt anyone.  I've done this before.  At this bank in fact.  My question is, what difference does it make whether I have an account there.  I'm not withdrawing money.  I've been denied by banks before.  One time, I told the teller I had an account, and she asked me what the number was.  When I told her I didn't remember, she asked me for my social security number so she could look it up.  It was at this point I admitted I didn't really have an account, I just wanted the quarters.  I didn't want to give her my SS#, because I figured her computer might be hooked into the IRS or something, and it would set off alarms when they found out I was lying.  She wouldn't give me the quarters.  I even offered her an extra dollar.  I give her 11, she gives me 10.  Either she or the bank gets an extra buck at the end of the day.  Who'd refuse that?  Well, she would, apparently.  I had to go to another bank.  Life would probably be easier if I didn't have to pay to do my laundry.

        Ok, so can they just play the game already?  This is the problem with the week off between the championship games and the SB.  I just want to get the game over so everyone will stop talking about it.  Of course, I live in New England, so people here are going bonkers, and I'm not.  And if I see one more TV feature with news people showing me how to make snacks for SB Sunday, I'm getting rid of my TV.  Is there anyone who's incompetent enough to not know how to make nachos?  Put some cheese on some chips, add more stuff if you want.  Heat until cheese melts, and remove from oven before chips become black and start to smoke.  Voila!  Food of the gods.

        It's been a while, sorry about that.  I'd like to thank those of you who've been checking in on a regular basis to see if I'd gotten off my lazy butt to type something.  Those who listen to the radio show know it's been quite hectic for the last week or so.  And this week I've been dealing with a cold.  God bless the makers of Ny-Quil.  You can read about that further down the page.  So I was at the supermarket tonight after work.  And there's a woman who's shopping at pretty much the same speed as me, except going the other way, so we pass each other in every aisle.  And it's one of those things where we both act like we're not looking at each other every time we pass, but of course, we are.  After a while, you might even give a little half-nod of recognition.  So, toward the end, I go down an aisle and I don't see her.  You've had this happen to you I'm sure.  When it does, do you wonder what happened to the other person?  What made them stop?  Most likely she's just comparing the ingredients of two different kinds of spaghetti sauce, but who knows?  It's kind of like breaking up with someone.   I wondered if she noticed that I wasn't there.  Then I realized I didn't even know this person, and I was being ridiculous.  Aren't you glad I told you about this?

        Remember what I said last week about the Eagles game saving my Sunday?  Well, this week I feel like I was punched in the stomach repeatedly for about 3 hours.  Depression is setting in.  It really is a sickness to be this upset over a football team.  At least I don't live in Philly anymore.  The whole city will be depressed for quite a while.  I should be able to bounce back faster than them.  Although here in Mass, there's celebrating another Super Bowl trip, so it will be in my face for 2 weeks.  If the Super Bowl was tomorrow, I wouldn't watch.  Maybe I'll recover by the time the game rolls around.

        The one (and there's only one) nice thing about the sub-zero weather is the day after.  I went out this morning when it was 20 degrees and it felt like Spring had sprung.  No problems starting the car, don't need the ski hat (or touque, as the Canadians call it).  Knock on wood, my computer hasn't given me any problems for the last 2 days.  And the scheduling gods allow me to watch the Eagles game tomorrow night.

Not good times.  Meantime, my computer problems are compounding.  It just never ends.  Think warm thoughts.

        Checking out the latest hits on my blog today, and there are two from "Dod Network Information Center" in Washington, DC.  Now, if it were "Dod Network Information Center" in say, Seattle, I probably wouldn't have even noticed.  But according to me, Dod in DC means D.O.D., as in Department of Defense.  So let me welcome the federal government to the site.  I promise you I'm not writing anything that's a threat to national security.  U-S-A! U-S-A!

        So those of you who listen to the show have already heard this story, but it bears repeating.  My cell phone problems have already been documented on the site.  I finally decided to do something about it.  So I called Samsung this morning after waiting two weeks for a response to my email to them.  The best they could do was to tell me, "Send us the phone, and we'll try to fix it, and you'll have it back in 2-4 weeks."  Well, like a lot of people, I no longer have a regular phone, just a cell.  So basically, they're telling me to live without a phone for a month.  I was not happy.  After arguing with the Samsung people for close to an hour today, (including telling them they'd be ripped on the air today) I called the Verizon Wireless people.  They replaced the phone in a half-hour, no problem.  Again, I ask, why do things have to be so complicated?  So, to recap, I highly recommend Verizon Wireless, but don't get a Samsung phone from them.

        Almost forgot, Happy New Year.  I had a game last night (an OT win), and then went out celebrating with the team.  I shouldn't be awake yet, but my body won't let me sleep past 9:00 anymore.  If I stayed up all night and went to bed at 8:45am, I'd wake up at 9.  No joke.  I'm going to move in slow motion all day.  Good thing there's nothing to do but watch football.  I'm going to cook up some pork butt in the crock pot today too.

        I was driving yesterday and I saw a student driver car.  Am I the only one who gets the urge to screw with them?  I always feel like doing something really dumb to freak out the driver.  The way I look at it, I'd be helping them get ready for driving in the real world.  Especially in Massachusetts.

        So for those wondering where I've been for 2 weeks, here's the rundown of my busiest stretch of the year.    Wed. Feb. 4 -- Home game vs. Worcester Thu. Feb. 5 -- The team hits the road for Bridgeport.  We actually stayed in Stamford instead at the Westin, which is one of the nicest hotels I've ever been in.  You know a hotel is too nice when you can't get lunch for under 15 bucks in the hotel restaurant. Fri. Feb. 6 -- Game in Bridgeport, post-game bus to Wilkes-Barre, PA. Sat. Feb. 7 -- Talk about going from the penthouse to the outhouse... we stay in the WB Holiday Inn.  While it's nice to have a T.G.I. Friday's attached to the lobby, it's basically a motel. Sun. Feb. 8 -- Quite possibly the longest night/day/night of my life.  The post-game bus from PA arrived at the arena at 3am.  I left for the airport at 4:15am.  Two flights to get to Grand Rapids, MI, lunch, a quick nap, a welcome reception from 4-6pm, the All-Star Skills competition, a post-game party from 9-1, party hopping around the hotels after that.  Let's just say the sun was up when I got back to my hotel.  If it's possible to cram a week's worth of activities into one day, I did it.   Mon. Feb. 9 -- This became one of the shortest days on record.  Slept well into the afternoon.  Great dinner at the local steakhouse, then the All-Star Game.  Ziggy got the MVP, which necessitated some more partying.  Not nearly as late (early) on this night, but still pretty late. Tue. Feb. 10 -- Fly home.  Get bumped off our flight semi-voluntarily in Grand Rapids, which earns me a free ticket the next time I fly.  Cool, cause I didn't pay for this trip anyway.  I get home about 5pm, have dinner and go right to bed.  Because... Wed. Feb. 11 -- Alarm goes off at 3:15am.  Unpack and re-pack.  The bus leaves the arena for Manchester Airport at 4:30am.  Fly Southwest (ugh) to Norfolk.  Land at 10.  We head to the arena for the team to skate.  Nap time that afternoon, and a game that night.  For some reason, I don't feel like going out after the game. Thu. Feb. 12 -- Not much happening.  Head over to hockey practice, then to the mall for lunch.  Stop at the movies to see "Miracle."  Highest recommendation.  Dinner and a couple beers has me ready for an early bed.  (And by the way... it's a tossup to determine who has the better beds.  The Westin "Heavenly Bed" in Stamford was unreal.  But the Norfolk Sheraton's beds are right up there.) Fri. Feb. 13 -- A second game in Norfolk and then out on the town with an old friend.  It was really nice to see her.  Good times at the dueling piano bar.  I'm there until they kick everyone out.   Sat. Feb. 14 -- Homeward bound.  Finally.  I think this whole thing is really catching up to me.  On our last flight, Southwest has booked every seat, and being in the last boarding group, I'm expecting to have to squeeze into a middle... BUT, fate intervenes.  I stroll all the way back, no seats.  I come back toward the front.  And being the last person without a seat, the flight attendant points out to me... A WINDOW SEAT IN AISLE 3.  CHA-CHIIIING!  Thanks to the husband and wife and their toddler for blocking this off from everyone else.  We get home, and again, it's dinner and bed time. Sun. Feb. 15 -- Home game. Mon. Feb. 16 -- Road game in Portland, ME.   Tue. Feb. 17 -- I make my first appearance in the office in 2 weeks. Wed. Feb. 18 -- Home game.  Which brings us all the way to today, which is a light day.  I've got the radio show this afternoon, then tomorrow opens up another three games in three days.  I need a nap just thinking about it.

        You know when you call a business or utility and get the automated system, then you press 3, then 2, then 7 to finally talk to a person?  Are they ever NOT experiencing "heavy call volume?"  I get the feeling there's one guy answering phones while 5 others are on break.  And it doesn't matter if it's 11pm.  Their phones apparently just never stop ringing.  You'd think since it's like this all the time, they'd hire a few extra people, so I wouldn't have to sit on hold for 25 minutes.  The other thing... you ever get faked out while you're waiting?  You know, you've got the awful hold music going, and suddenly it stops, and you're all ready to talk.  And the voice says, "Please continue to hold, and your call will be answered in the order in which it was received."  And then it's back to the awful music.  Damn.

        So the Pats win the Super Bowl, and now I'm stuck listening to all these Mass-heads bragging until baseball season starts.  Then they'll all be tied up with the Sox-Yankees again.  For the record, I thought the commercials were hit-and-miss this year.  Among the commercials that stand out in my memory... Willie Nelson shilling for H&R Block tax services, the donkey who wanted to be a clydesdale, and the NFL Network promo where everyone who didn't make the Super Bowl was singing the "Tomorrow" song from Annie.  But you can't go wrong with lighting horse farts on fire.  Thank god for beer commercials.  And how bout that halftime show?  Does the NFL know their prime audience or what?  P. Diddy, Nelly, Kid Rock, Janet, Justin Timberlake.  Not putting down their music, but rap is tough to lip sync to, obviously.  And what the hell happened at the end there?  After Justin and Janet stopped with the heavy petting, did he expose her boob?  That's perfect family entertainment.  AOL should be proud to sponsor that.  Next up, when will these networks stop scheduling shows to run after the Super Bowl.  I mean, "Survivor All-Stars" starts at about 11pm.  So much for that audience on the east coast.  I'm watching it though, just to see who they consider an "all star."  I've watched several of the previous Survivors, and I hate most of the people they chose.  I can't believe how many of the previous winners they've got back.  A million bucks must not last that long these days.

        So I'm flipping around during a commercial break in the Bruins-Hurricanes game tonight and I happen by "American Idol."  And who's guest-judging tonight?  Ashford and Simpson.  What, were the  urlLink Captain & Tennille  already booked?  If you've never heard of Ashford and Simpson, you're younger than me, but maybe not by much.  As a full-service blog, I now provide you with a link to their  urlLink bio .  Do these A.I. people know their target audience or what?  I can't imagine Ashford & Simpson's fanbase are watching Idol.  Then again, I can't imagine Ashford & Simpson having a fanbase.  And Ryan Seacrest apparently had just come from an audition for Miami Vice: The Movie.  The white suit was top notch.  All he needed was to roll up the sleeves.  He even had the five o'clock shadow going.  Crockett and Tubbs would be proud.  I couldn't tell if he had loafers with no socks though.

        Not sure how, but I picked up a stomach bug at some point this weekend.  Hit me hard on Sunday night and kept me up half the night.  I didn't feel too bad today, but couldn't risk going to work.  Had to stay close to my home base, if you know what I mean.  Last thing I needed was to be running out of the studio in the middle of the show today.  Even better, it's quite possible this was my own fault.  I cooked up a nice dinner on Saturday, and may have poisoned myself.  This after I was able to fight off a cold over the weekend too.  Sorry there haven't been too many updates lately.  I've been pretty busy, and I've also been suffering from a bit of writer's block.  Just haven't had much to say.  If you've got any ideas of things I can rant on, let me know.

        Why is it people on TV always eat their chinese take-out food with chopsticks?  Does this really happen anywhere?  I order lots of chinese food, and neither have, nor have ever been provided with, chopsticks.

        Thoughts that occurred to me while wondering why people from other countries always sound American when they sing.  We're nearing the 1000th visitor.  Could be today.  Stay tuned.  They're doing work on my building somewhere that entails power saws and hammering, so I didn't get to sleep very late this morning.  In case you haven't noticed (and that's why I'm here), the  urlLink Game Show Network , always a solid choice when there's nothing on, has changed its name to GSN-The Network For Games.  Apparently the reason for this is they're going to start showing non-game show programs.  The first up is "World Series of Blackjack."  Now, I understand that poker has gotten over huge on other networks, but blackjack?  What's the attraction to watch that?  Poker games are interesting in that the players are bluffing each other and you know it.  In blackjack the biggest cliffhanger you can have is whether Ed will hit on 16.  The other thing that irks me about this is, are we supposed to forget what GSN stands for?  It's Game Show Network.  You can't just ignore what the letters stand for.  Just go the whole way and change the name if you want to do something different.  It's like when KFC suddenly became KFC.  Is there anyone who doesn't remember what KFC used to mean?  There was a circus at the arena this weekend.  Not only did it stink the place up, of course, but it got me wondering.  What kind of insurance costs do you think they have to pay to be able to let kids get elephant rides.  I mean, every once in a while you hear about one of these elephants snapping and running amok wreaking havoc.  Now imagine one doing that with 6 kids sitting on its back barely harnessed in.  Flipping around the dial, I wonder why they put rap groups on as the musical guests on "Live with Regis & Kelly."  Is that their target audience?  I'd love it if just one time they'd show the audience so I could see the horrified looks on the faces of all the old ladies.  Finally, how about those Orangemen?  The defending champs move into the Sweet 16, and a date with 8 seed Alabama Thursday night.  Go CUSE!

        Just got back in from post-game festivities, and wanted to bang out a quick update.  It's been a wild week in radio-land, with St. Patrick's Day plus lots of games.  We're coming down to the wire with only 11 games left, including one in about 14 and a half hours in Worcester.  A quick thanks to the listeners who came out to J.J. Boomers for our live broadcast, especially to those of you who bought us beers and shots during the show.  You are my favorites.  You may notice I've added a new feature to the site.  If you look out the right side of the aircraft, you'll find a guestbook.  Click on it and leave a message.  Also... as of this posting, we've had 970 visitors to this site since I got the counter in mid-December.  Number 1000 should happen sometime in the next few days.  I'd like to come up with a prize for the person who hits the magic number.  If you have any suggestions, let me know.  Also, you may notice some of the old postings have disappeared from the bottom of the page.  They still exist.  If you want to read stuff from the early days of the site, just click on the archive link of your choice on the right side of the page.

        Have you seen this crawl across the screen on MTV, SpikeTV, CBS, Comedy Central, etc.?  They've been telling people to call Dish Network, because they've been thinking about taking those channels off their service.  So we should call them and complain that we can't live without South Park.  The thing they don't tell you is why Dish Network is doing this.  And it's because Viacom, who owns all of these channels has jacked up their rates big time for Dish Network to carry them.  And Dish Network surprisingly didn't agree with that because they'd have to charge their customers for it.  So today, they pulled the channels off their system.  Good for them!  Finally someone stands up for the people.  I guarantee most cable and dish providers would easily pay the money and just pass the cost on to the viewers, whether they wanted to pay it or not.  That's why cable costs so much.  Except for me.  My cable is included in my rent.  Otherwise, I'd be putting in a Dish Network system.  Although I'd probably wait until they get those channels back on.  Otherwise I wouldn't be able to watch "Most Extreme Elimination Challenge."  My support has limits.

        We are liiiiiive, from my NEW laptop.  That's right.  After more than three years, I've upgraded to a new one.  Watching my old one fall apart at the seams for the last few months, having it stop when it got tired or cranky, and generally sucking... I finally had enough.  Several computer experts decided it wasn't worth trying to fix the old one.  So I spent my off day shopping in New Hampshire then moving stuff from one computer to the other.  The only thing I can say is, this thing rocks!  Wireless internet capability, bigger screen, Windows XP.  I will say though, I'll miss my old laptop.  We had some good times together including travels all over North America.  I won't know what to do if this one doesn't freeze up at least once an hour.

        ESPN is doing reports all week on Sex & Sports.  Today's topic... college football recruiting and strippers.  Coaches and schools are SHOCKED, SHOCKED I SAY! to hear that recruits are being entertained by strippers and given alcohol while on recruiting visits to their schools.  Honestly, like this isn't happening at every big time school there is.  Except maybe BYU.  This can't be true!  Next thing they'll tell us is that college players are getting paid under the table and are getting free cars and stuff.  Please.  Is this worthy of a special report?  What do you think these guys do to try to get these players to come to their school?  Take them to dinner in the dining hall and play Playstation all night?

        Again it's been forever since I've put anything up here.  No excuses this time, I just haven't felt like it, and/or I haven't had anything worth posting.  I've been peeking in on the Oscars tonight, and just wanted to share a few observations.    What's the deal with Sean Penn?  Every time the camera panned by him tonight, his face was kind of scrunched up, like someone next to him just farted.  And he's Best Actor?  How bout acting like you want to be there?  This guy was Spicoli, for crying out loud.    How hip is Billy Crystal making Janet Jackson boob jokes?  He made up for it later with a good crack about the "Best Documentary" guy getting audited after ripping on the government.  Why is it these documentary people have to pull this stuff every year?  But to show you where the country is going, this guy (who was wearing sneakers with his tux, by the way) actually got laughs and some nervous applause, instead of boos like Michael Moore.  And Sean Penn dropped a WMD's joke in his speech too.  Does anyone really care what these people think politically?  They should institute a rule where any winner who uses their speech as a pulpit to push an agenda has their Oscar taken away.    You know when they do the "In memoriam" thing, where they show all the people who died in the last year?  I always feel bad for the ones that don't get much applause.  They go nuts for Buddy Ebsen, but the next guy gets nada.    Hottest looking actress of the night?  Tough call.  Charlize Theron is a personal favorite, and she looked really good.  Plus, she won, and everyone loves a winner.  But how about the dark horse?  39 year old Diane Lane.  Unreal.  I might have to see a replay to determine a winner.  Like a photo finish.   I want to be Steven Spielberg for a day, just so they'll play the Indiana Jones theme when I walk across a stage.    Are these "Lord of the Rings" movies really good, or is the Academy full of Dungeons and Dragons geeks?    One of these years, I'm actually going to have seen one of the Best Picture nominees before the awards.    Ok, enough of the Oscars... a couple a quick tv suggestions.  If you like stupid, sophomoric comedy, check out "Most Extreme Elimination Challenge" on SpikeTV.  It's a cheesy Japanese game show that takes place outdoors, where people do stunts, most of which end up with the contestant taking a rather nasty looking fall and bouncing into pools of water.  It's all dubbed in English and they give everyone pun-filled names and fake occupations, and turn the whole thing into sex metaphors.  I got hooked on this during a marathon of the show this week.  I'm not just asking for them to put this on DVD, I'm demanding it.  Also, I've gotten into "The Apprentice."  Yes, the Donald Trump reality show.  I just can't stand most of the contestants, but I need to watch them try to backstab each other and eventually cheer when one of them gets fired.  The only problem is that one of these idiots eventually has to win and will get a quarter million dollar a year job.  Maybe they'll pull a twist at the end, keep the most annoying person as the winner.  Then the next day, Trump will fire them and take the money back.

      These friars were behind in their belfry payments, so they decided to open a small flower shop to raise money. Since everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of God, a rival florist across town thought the competition was unfair. He asked the good fathers to close the shop, but they refused. So the rival florist hired Hugh MacTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to "persuade" them to close. Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store, saying they'd better close or he'd be back. And so the friars closed the flower shop, thereby proving that Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.

        Those of you who check this thing on a regular basis have probably been wondering what happened to me.  Talking with someone last night, they reminded me I need to update at some point just to keep people's attention.  So here goes.  Where have I been?  Quite simply, I've just been being a lazy bum.  The hockey season ended, with the Monsters missing the playoffs for the second year in a row.  And once that happened, I pretty much lost all motivation to do anything for a while.  I went through my annual post-season haze.  I don't shave until my face gets so itchy I can't stand it anymore.  (That took about a week.)  I wear nothing but t-shirts and jeans.  Basically I look and act like I'm unemployed, even though I still show up at work.  It's become an annual tradition to wind down after hockey season ends.  It's now mostly passed.  And since I haven't really been doing much except working and watching the NHL playoffs, there hasn't been much to write about.  I'm going to rectify that though.  Time to get re-focused.  Regular updates should be resuming.

        Ever notice that when a celebrity gets hot, they get totally overexposed?  I was watching the Indy 500 Sunday, only to see Jessica Simpson singing the national anthem, and husband Nick just hanging out there for no particular reason.  Is anyone else just sick of them?  There's not a televised event that goes by without the two of them.  She's really hot, but I can't take it anymore.  It's like their agent is trying to cash in as much as possible because he knows they're not going to be around a year from now.  Good news... I saw a promo for a new season of "The Joe Schmoe Show" tonight.  I'm not sure if there's any way it could be as good as last year, but I'm hoping.  For those not familiar, the premise is that it's a reality show, but with all actors except for one real person.  The guy they had on last year was great, and never had a clue what was going on.  This year they're going to try it with a couple, as part of a dating-type reality show.  Should be interesting.  Check your local listings.  Had a great time on vacation down at the lake, and I'll get some pictures up online for you to see soon.  We really went all out on the "Poker Run" and won "Best Appearing Crew", even landing on the front page of the local newspaper.  You can check out a picture on their website  urlLink by clicking here.   I'm not sure how long it will be there, but give it a shot.

        Now that's a weekend.  This past weekend was the annual pilgrimage to Mighty Taco in Buffalo.  Many people have been asking whether it's worth the drive to get these tacos.  The short answer is no.  But, it's not the tacos that make the trip.  It's just one of those things you have to do now and then to make life interesting.  So here's the story.  My buddy JT and I have been frequenting Mighty Taco (a Buffalo-area chain) from afar since college.  Last year on a whim, we decided to meet in Syracuse for the weekend and head to Buffalo for a "Mighty Pack" (more on that in a sec).  We had a great time last year... enough so to make this an annual event.  Friday after work, we head for Syracuse, about a five hour drive from here.  Arrive around midnight, check into the Motel 6 (cheapest in town) and go for a few beers before last call.  Then Saturday morning we head out for Buffalo (about 2 hours and 15 minutes if all goes well).  Lunch at the Mighty Taco always consists of a "Mighty Pack" and possibly more.  A "Mighty Pack" is six tacos.  They come with a  slice  of cheese rather than shredded, which is the only place I've ever seen that, plus lettuce and tomatoes and taco sauce (hot, medium or mild).  Hard shell or soft, your choice, all for $5.29.  And yes, six tacos is a lot of food, thanks for asking.  We spend all of 20 minutes at the MT, then head across the street to the mall to walk it off for a bit, then stop at Krispy Kreme to stock up on donuts for everyone back home, then it's back to Syracuse.  All in all, we spent under 2 hours in Greater Buffalo.  Got back to 'Cuse in time to catch a nap before heading out to the S.U. campus.  Small bite to eat at the Acropolis for pizza at 9, then onto Faegan's, the upperclassman bar.  Lots of beer is consumed, as are a couple shots, one of which was on the house courtesy of a friendly bartender.  The only thing that would have been better was if there were more students left on campus, since graduation was last weekend.  Post-drinking, we stop off at the "Pita Pit" for a gyro to take back to the hotel, and catch a cab.  For some reason, my stomach was not feeling that great when I got up Sunday.  JT and I went our separate ways, and I headed down the NY State Thruway, stopping off at the casino on my way home for the second year in a row.  And for the second year in a row my trip got a lot more expensive.  I guess it's just tradition now.  Got home last night and hit the sack early.  Just one of those weekends.

        Someone sent me a list of 97 questions that tell you absolutely nothing about yourself. Here's the list:   1. Are you an innie or an outie?    I'm an innie.  2. Have you ever worn bell-bottoms?    Lord No.  3. Have you ever written a song?    No.  4. Can you make change for a dollar right now?    Sorry, no change in my pocket right now.  5. Have you ever been in the opposite sex's public toilet?   Yes, and no I won't explain the circumstances.  6. Have you ever smelled your own feet?   Yes, I believe everyone should from time to time.  7. Do you like catsup on or beside your fries?   If I use it at all, on the side.  8. Can you touch your tongue to your nose?    Unfortunately, no.  9. Have you ever been a boy/girl scout?   No, but I have eaten girl scout cookies.  10. Have you ever broken a mirror?    Not that I recall.  11. Have you ever put your tongue on a frozen pole?   No, but I have tried to get others to do it.  12. What is your biggest pet peeve?   People who are incompetent at their job.  13. Do you slurp your drink after it's gone?    No, because I never use a straw.  14. Have you ever blown bubbles in your milk?

What the hell does that mean?  45. Would you rather have an ant farm with no ants or a box of crayons with broken points?

Which of these do you think is more dangerous: an angry bear or a hungry white shark?    I've never encountered either one, but I'm guessing I'd have a better chance of out-running the bear than out-swimming the shark.  54. Would you climb a very high tree to save a kitten?    No, I'm allergic to cats.  55. Can you tell the difference between a crocodile and an alligator?    Crikey. No.  56. Do you drink Pepsi or Coke?    Neither of much, but definitely Coke.  57.

If I'm alone, sure.  61. Have you ever slipped in the bathtub?    Yes, but I've never fallen.  62. Do you use regular or deodorant soap?    I had to go check... deodorant.

Simpsons, of course. "D'OH!"  65. If you could invite any movie star to your home for dinner, who would it be?    I don't know, but I hope they'd be cooking.

Which would you rather live with: a huge nose or crossed eyes?    The nose I guess. Depends on how well I could see with the crossed eyes.  68. Would you hang out with someone your best friend didn't like?    If my best friend wasn't around, yeah, who cares?  69. Would you hang out with someone your best friend liked, but you didn't like?    Probably. I hang out with people I don't like all the time.  70. Have you ever returned a gift?    Only if it didn't fit.  71. Would you give someone else a gift that had been given to you?    What do you think I am? A re-gifter?  71. If you could attend an Olympic Event, what would it be?    No way I'm going to Athens. What a zoo that'll be. I'd go see the Olympic Hockey Finals.  72. How many pairs of shoes do you own?    3 pairs -- one pair sneakers, one pair black shoes, one pair brown shoes. And one pair of sandals if you want to count those. Oh, and my golf shoes.

If you had to choose, what branch of the military would you be in?    I'd like to be on the Armed Forces Radio Network.  86. Would you ever parachute out of a plane?    I've thought about it. I don't like flying in planes much, so I'd probably like to jump out of one.  87. What do you think is your best feature ?   I've been told I have great eyes.  88. If you were to win a grammy, what kind of music would it be for?     Extremely bad music: Cheesy 80's variety.  89. What is your favorite season?

How many years will/did you end up going to college?  Made it in 4. Amazing.  94. Have you ever had surgery?  Yes, twice.  95. Would you rather be a professional figure skater or professional football player?  Football player, since I'm not gay.  96. What do you like to collect?  Great stories, anecdotes, war stories, etc.  97. How many collectibles do you have?  I have 7 bobbleheads.

        You know what I hate about grocery shopping?  It's the feeling you get when you get home, and you're putting the stuff away, and you realize you forgot to buy something.  For me this time it was paper plates.  Being a single guy, I don't use regular plates unless a paper plate would be impossible.  Well I ran out of paper plates 2 days ago, and totally forgot.  It took me about 15 seconds after I got home to remember.  That sucks.  Also, can we as a society institute a penalty for people who forget to put something in their cart, only to remember while at the checkout counter?  A couple in front of me forgot the whipped cream (insert your own jokes here) so the guy goes wandering all over the store looking for it.  So I, and the woman waiting behind me, have to wait, while their food is all bagged and ready, for him to return with it.  Brutal.

        So I spent Friday night at the arena watching my first "Mixed Martial Arts" show.  For those not familiar, two guys in bare feet and wearing very small gloves (which I think are designed to protect their knuckles more than their opponent) try to beat the heck out of each other in a boxing ring.  You can punch, kick, knee, whatever.  And it's not like boxing, if a guy goes down, you dive on top and keep slugging.  It's actually kind of a cross between boxing, amateur wrestling, and karate.  It was pretty interesting.  One guy got "knocked the F out", a few guys had to submit to what looked like pretty painful holds.  I was surprised at the main event, though, as the headliner was fighting a guy who appeared to be roughly 1/3 of his size.  He demolished this poor guy, who never had a chance.  Overall, not a bad way to spend a Friday night, as the show lasted more than 3 hours, and we had pretty good seats for only 20 bucks.  They've got to do something about the ring announcer, though.  The guy was making me dizzy the way he kept moving around the ring.  Just stand still and talk, dude.  Anyway, if the promoters read this, I might be available for the next show... call my agent.

        Well, another season of the Sopranos wrapped up last night, and it was one of the few good episodes of this run.  Actually, the last 2 of this season were sweet, because they got back to the good stuff.  People getting whacked for various reasons, problems within the family, a potential war with the NY crew.  I really thought they were trying to kill Tony when he looked into the field and saw those guys coming with shotguns.  Speaking of shotguns, how about Tony shooting his cousin in the face with one?  That's old school mob justice right there.  I just hope they're not going to get rid of Johnny Sack with this whole arrest thing.  He's the one guy who's been stirring things up this season.  But here's the thing that really gets me with this show.  They've got some good momentum built up, people are excited about the show again, and I hear that they're not even going to start shooting new episodes until sometime in 2005, maybe not even ready for air until 2006!  And to top that, I've heard it's going to be an abbreviated season.  Abbreviated?  They're regular seasons seem like they're only about 6 weeks long.  What are they going to do 2 episodes and call it a day?  Overall a decent weekend.  Ran some errands on Saturday, including buying a new bed, then headed to a Stanley Cup party hoping to see Calgary win the Cup, but it didn't happen.  One more chance with Game 7 tonight.  Hopefully they'll let at least one of the Lock Monster guys play.  Either way at least Commodore's name will go on the Cup.  Yesterday's weather was pretty nasty, so I didn't get a whole lot accomplished.  Just hung around the apartment and tried to motivate myself to get stuff ready for the impending move.  By the way, as far as the bed goes, I can't believe the prices on some of these things.  One of the first beds they tried to sell my was 16-hundred bills.  And damn was it comfy.  I thought about it for a few seconds, and then moved on to something a little closer to my price range.  Ended up getting a decent price for it, and I can't wait to break it in.

        Quick update... the kid who passed out during the spelling bee finished second.  He went on to spell 8 more words after "the incident."  Impressive.

        Quick update. The kid who passed out in the Spelling Bee (see below) just came out for the next round. The brought him a stool onto the stage so he wouldn't have as far to fall this time. He is clearly shaken, yet manages to correctly spell "lyophilize." This is better than Willis Reed limping onto the court in 1970 to lead the Knicks to the championship. If this kid wins, he goes down as the best pressure speller in history. If he doesn't though, you know his friends are going to bring out that tape at parties. "Hey, wanna watch that tape of you in the spelling bee again?"

        Once again this year, I find myself watching the National Spelling Bee coverage on ESPN. Yes, it's true. I need to find better ways to spend my free time. And once again I ask, "Why is ESPN covering this thing? Is spelling really a sport?" Well, they're trying to make it more sport-like. This year they have added a shot clock. The kids now are under strict timing rules, so you can't stand there for ten minutes like someone did last year.  Honestly, I don't know what I find so fascinating about middle school geniuses suffering through the intense pressures of competition. OH MY GOD! This kid just fainted! I swear to god! And he gets back up and spells it right! A-L-O-P-E-C-O-I-D.  That's right up there with Michael Jordan scoring 38 points in the NBA Finals with the flu in a game where they pretty much had to carry him off the court. Of course, this kid's name is Akshay Buddiga, so he's had some practice with spelling. You know, suddenly I don't feel so bad about watching this. If it's so intense the competitors are passing out, that's great TV. The only other thing that can happen after that is a 12 year old freaking out and running of the stage screaming. I wonder if there's ever been a spelling-related injury. Do they have a doctor standing by just in case? When he comes back for the next round, they may want to give him a break and just let him spell "CAT" or something.  By the way, alopecoid means "fox-like."   I'm also loving the play-by-play and color analysts. I can't imagine broadcasting an event like this. The color person is dropping in hints, such as, "since it's a Greek root, that told her that the 'ih' sound in the middle was a Y instead of an I." Well, obviously. They need to get John Madden in on this. "Watch this right here! BOOM! He pulls that -IGH ending out of nowhere!" Then he starts using the telestrator on the kid who passed out. "You can see the blood rush to his head RIGHT THERE!" Why don't they let me run ESPN?

        ESPN as part of their 25th anniversary is putting out a bunch of lists of the top 25 this and thats of the past 25 years.  And of course they're making shows about all the lists complete with comments from various people a la VH1's endless supply of "I Love the 80's", etc.  Last night I saw their list of the 25 Greatest Sports Movies of the Last 25 Years, and I felt the need to comment.  Here's a look at the ESPN list.  25. Searching for Bobby Fischer - We start with a CHESS MOVIE??? Ok, it's a really good movie, but it's CHESS! If you've never seen it, it's worth catching some time. 24. Rudy - How is this not higher on the list?  I'll grant you it's a little cheesy, but it's a true story and if you don't get a little choked up at the end, you're a heartless bastard.  I probably saw this movie about 50 times on cable while I was in college.  It's the ultimate underdog tale.  I'd have to get this into the top 10. 23. Cobb - Have only seen parts of this movie.  Tommy Lee Jones as Ty Cobb, with Robert Wuhl following him around.  Points off for Robert Wuhl being involved in a high-profile role.  Although Jimmy Buffett has a small role in this, so extra credit for that. 22. Bend it Like Beckham - Never saw it. Never wanted to see it. Let's move on. 21. Ali - How they managed to make a boring movie out of Muhammed Ali's life is beyond me.  Will Smith was pretty dead on in his impersonation though. 20. The Rookie - Another amazing true story that deserves to be higher on the list. 37 year old high school coach Jim Morris is convinced to try out for the big leagues as a pitcher, and gets signed.  He struggles throught the minors while dealing with being away from his family and eventually gets called up to the majors. His little boy gets to see his dad pitch in the big leagues. His dad, with whom he's had a rocky relationship comes to the game, and he gives dad the game ball. It's getting a little dusty in here just thinking about it. 19. Finding Forrester - Never saw it. Didn't even know it was a sports movie, but apparently there's some basketball involved or something. 18. The Color of Money - Again, I question whether pool is a sport. A good movie though, with a young Tom Cruise as the brash young know-it-all, and Paul Newman as the aging "Fast Eddie" from "The Hustler" trying to teach the kid about life and pool. And who hasn't danced around a pool table like Vince, swinging the stick and acting like an idiot? 17. The Hurricane - Just because it's about a boxer, doesn't necessarily make it a sports movie. The true story of Ruben "Hurricane" Carter, the boxer who spent 30 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. It got Denzel a Best Actor nomination. But from what I remember, the movie doesn't feature that much boxing. But I guess if you took all the non-sports sports movies off this list, you'd have to include "Happy Gilmore" and crap like that. 16. 61* - This was an HBO movie.  Billy Crystal's ode to Maris and Mantle's chase of the Babe in 1961. Another good true story, as Maris gets the home run record, and an asterisk, and people hate him for being better than Mickey, for not being a more exciting personality and for beating Babe Ruth.  Very interesting look at two legendary ball players. 15. Tin Cup - A great movie up until the last 5 minutes. I'll watch it any time it's on. Lots of pro golfer cameos, Costner is able to pull off the golf swing and the down-and-out character, Don Johnson as the bad guy. Superb. Then the ending comes. I understand why Tin Cup couldn't win the U.S. Open, but the 240 yard shot that goes in the hole to score a 14 and send the crowd into a frenzy was just dumb.  Bonus points for using actual golf announcers throughout the movie, and allowing them to sound realistic. Most of the time, movie sportscasters annoy me because whoever writes the script doesn't know what they're supposed to say. 14. Major League - Speaking of sportscasters... Bob Uecker steals the show as Harry Doyle, the whiskey-drinking Cleveland Indians announcer. We learn during the Top 25 show that most of Uecker's stuff in the movie was ad-libbed. Makes it even better. A genuinely funny movie, with the super-underdog Indians beating the hated Yankees in a one game playoff. Now if only they'd stopped before they came up with Major League 2 and 3. 13. White Men Can't Jump - Wesley and Woody as playground basketball hustlers, and two hours of pure trash-talking genius. Unfortunately they had to include the sub-plot with Rosey Perez as the nagging girlfriend. I don't know how they could have come up with a more annoying character or actress to play her. It was almost like the writers thought the movie was too good and they needed to bring it back down closer to earth.  12. Eight Men Out - Have never seen this all the way through. It's the story of the 1919 Chicago "Black Sox" who threw the World Series. Don't remember enough to comment. 11. A League of Their Own - The WW2-era women's pro baseball league. Not a bad movie, although not one I can watch over and over. Mostly because I didn't like the women they chose. And while some of them look like they can actually play, others throw like, well, girls. And here's the other sportscasters pet peeve of mine. Why is it that most sports movies seem to have the play-by-play guy broadcasting to the crowd in the ballpark? Have you ever been any place where that happens? I will give credit that one of the announcers is "Squiggy" from "Laverne & Shirley."  Tom Hanks is excellent as the drunk manager who doesn't want any part of coaching women. 10. Remember the Titans - A minor league bus trip favorite. Great music, which always helps, and a great story about overcoming racism in late-60's Virginia. Denzel is solid as the head coach, as are most of the players. But the assistant coach's daughter is was gets me here. It's cute at the beginning, as she knows lots about football, and she's really into the games. But they just beat that joke into the ground for the rest of the movie. It's a good movie, but I think I'd have to drop it out of my top 10 to move Rudy, Major League and The Rookie up the ladder. 9.  Seabiscuit - Just saw this for the first time on a road trip the other night, although we got home before it ended. A genuinely good movie. I can't rate it though, because I didn't get to see the ending. 8.  Jerry Maguire - A chick flick posing as a sports movie. It revolves around football, and agents, and has lots of sports cameos. But as soon as they released that Springsteen song with the sound clips about "You had me at hello," they blew the sports theme away. Also, if anyone has any information on the whereabouts of Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career, please call the FBI hotline. This guy won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this movie. What's he done since? Rat Race. Snowdogs. Boat Trip. Radio. Stop me if you've heard of any of these. The guy probably thought his career was about to take off. 7.  Chariots of Fire - Never seen it, but the theme song "Dah dah dah dah dahhhhhh dahhhhh" is classic. 6.  The Natural - Now we're getting into tough territory here. The top 6 are really hard to rank. The Natural is an amazing movie. Redford is great as the too-old rookie. Wilford Brimley is perfect as the tough manager. The scheming Judge trying to get the great Roy Hobbs to take a dive. Little know fact, in the book, Hobbs doesn't homer at the end of the game. But for movie purposes, he had to come through. 5.  Caddyshack - Probably the most quoteable movie of all time. "You'll get nothing and like it." "I feel like a hundred dollars." "Hey everybody! We're all gonna get laid." "Did somebody step on a duck?" "It's in the hole!" As they said on the show, you've got Rodney, Chevy, Ted Knight and Bill Murray all in their primes. Yes it's a silly movie, and yes I watch it every time it's on TV, and yes I know most of the lines by heart. 4.  Bull Durham - I think this one may be my all-time favorite, even before I got involved in minor league baseball. This could be criticized as being too much of a romantic movie, but I think it centers enough around baseball and life to be a great sports movie as well. The scene where they sneak into the park and turn the sprinklers on to get a rainout for the next day is a classic. And there are times during the baseball season that everyone wishes they'd really do that so you can get a day off. Costner's great in this one too, just as he is in... 3.  Field of Dreams - If you build it, maybe Kevin Costner could just make sports movies for the rest of his career. Another great movie, which is all about baseball fantasy until the end, when you realized what you've just seen is really about fathers and sons. Again, when he gets to see his dad as a young man and asks him if he wants to have a catch... wow, talk about misty. Is there anything that will choke a guy up faster than a tender moment between father and son at the end of a sports movie?  2.  Raging Bull - I can't believe I've never seen this movie. You're talking about the Big Three from one of my favorite movies, "Goodfellas" in DeNiro, Pesci and Scorsese. That puts it in the top ten even without seeing it. I may have to go rent this one just out of general principle.  1.  Hoosiers - A fine choice for number one, as Gene Hackman turns a group of farm boys into the Indiana State High School Champions. Another great underdog story. When Hackman takes them into the huge gym and has them measure the height of the rim to show them that the court's the same size as their gym back in Hickory, it's quite possibly the best movie coaching moment ever. I still get chills at the end, even though I've seen this movie a million times. That's a great movie, when your reaction at the end the 50th time you see it is the same as the first time.  So there's ESPN's list. My Top 10 probably looks something like this...  Bull Durham, Caddyshack, Field Of Dreams, Hoosiers, The Natural, Major League, Tin Cup, The Rookie, Rudy, and Raging Bull. Honorable mention goes to Slap Shot, which is one of my all-time favorite movies, although it doesn't fit into the last 25 years, which was the criteria. Goes right up there with Bull Durham and Caddyshack.

        Yes, I'm still alive.  Yes, I haven't updated this thing in a month.  What can I say, I've been a little busy.  We're almost three weeks into the baseball season, and as usual, it's been both fun and tiring.  We haven't even had a long roadtrip yet.  I've also moved into my new place, out of the city and into the peaceful tax-free countryside of New Hampshire.  So those are the two things that have taken up most of my time.  By the way, if you ever have to move, just burn everything you own and replace it when you get to the new place.  Take it from someone who moves way too often... It's gotta be better than actually moving everything.  I didn't even bring most of my furniture and it still was a pain in the ass.
