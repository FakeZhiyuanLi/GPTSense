      My laptop isn't feeling too well.&nbsp; I spilled hot wax all over the keyboard and the LCD the other day.&nbsp; I did a pretty good job of getting it off the screen, but the keyboard is a mess.&nbsp; So I went on eBay and ordered myself a replacement keyboard for 30 bucks.&nbsp; I was going to go through Dell, but I figured why pay like well over 100 bucks for something I can do in minutes.&nbsp; When I get the keyboard in, I will take pics of me replacing it.&nbsp; This is the first time I am actually opening up my laptop to work on it.&nbsp; Yipes!&nbsp; I have always been more comfortable with desktop pc's, but I think it's about time I get more involved with my pride and joy.&nbsp; That's it for now.&nbsp; I need to go shower and pack.&nbsp; I am staying over  Julie's  house tonight because the Linkin Park concert is tomorrow.&nbsp; Yay!

      So I spent 70 bucks on albums when I was on iTunes.&nbsp; I have been turned on to some great music as of late.&nbsp; It all started with Postal Service.&nbsp; Postal Service's CD "Give Up" is a must own for anyone.&nbsp; I mean it is one of the few CDs where I love every single song.&nbsp; Truly amazing shit.&nbsp; Postal Service was formed when the lead singer of another great band Death Cab for Cutie got together with Jimmy Tamborello of Dntel.&nbsp; The called the band Postal Service because they recorded everything through the mail.&nbsp; Everyone should buy this album now!!!&nbsp; Another great Indie band is Architechture in Helsinki.&nbsp; They mix brass with great vocals and percussion.&nbsp; Very mellow and chill.&nbsp; Finally there is Belle & Sebastian.&nbsp; Same mellow kind of tones.&nbsp; Leave comments of bands you think deserve a download and I'll check them out!&nbsp; :-)

      Did you ever sit around and wonder about something?&nbsp; Like the universe.&nbsp; I get all freaked out when I think about it.&nbsp; I mean what  is  the universe?&nbsp; Are we inside something else?&nbsp; Where does it end?&nbsp; Where does it begin?&nbsp; I seriously fuck myself up thinking about it. &nbsp;&nbsp; Try it.&nbsp; See.&nbsp; Told ya so.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp;when I take my vacation next week, I plan on making some observations about some things.&nbsp; Like how I live my life.&nbsp; What I'm doing that is&nbsp;right.&nbsp; What I am doing that is wrong.&nbsp; I want to come away with something that will be helpful.&nbsp; I need to change the way I am doing things around here.&nbsp; This is the first time in like almost 2 years I am getting an entire week off.&nbsp; It should prove to be interesting....&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Yea.&nbsp; I said I was going to be typing a lot.&nbsp; I inadvertently lied.&nbsp; Work has been so hectic and crazy these past two days this is the first moment I have gotten to sit and actually gather my thoughts.&nbsp; I am sick still.&nbsp; I am such an idiot.&nbsp; I stop taking the antibiotics once I feel better.&nbsp; I need to finish out the entire course of them.&nbsp; I will begin that tomorrow.&nbsp; I have a mystery rash on my chest.&nbsp; I don't know where it came from, but it's weird.&nbsp; I thought it might be and allergic reaction to my meds, but alas, it's still there.&nbsp; If that doesn't clear up, off to the doctor I go for more prodding.&nbsp; I swear.&nbsp; I need to take better care of myself.&nbsp; So how have all of you been?&nbsp; Good I hope.&nbsp; I have been downloading shitloads of music off of iTunes.&nbsp; It is really amazing and for any of you who don't own an iPod, go get one.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; I will give you $20 towards one if you take that money and actually go and get it.&nbsp; I am serious.&nbsp; I think everyone on this planet should have one.&nbsp; I have over 900 songs on mine and still have ten gigs left.&nbsp; That's a lot!&nbsp; Well I am off to go download some more music, so leave your comments and suggestions as always.&nbsp; Which is never lately so get posting!&nbsp; I will type more later when I am not so bajang.&nbsp;

      Can we start over? Meet each other again? I once was close to you. Told you everything in my head. Unwanted. Scared. Nervous. Sad. Hated. Unworthy. You just don't understand do you!?!?! Take a fucking step back! See what this is doing to me! Stop being so right And help me fix what is wrong. You're my friend. Or so I thought you were. May be you were right. It's time to grow up. But if growing up means being like you, Let me be young forever!

      My visit went well today.&nbsp; I had a pretty good rapport going with the RM and ZVP.&nbsp;  Joe  was being a jerk.&nbsp; I know what I have to fix.&nbsp; Just let me do it.&nbsp; I took a three hour nap before.&nbsp;&nbsp;It felt good to just relax.&nbsp; Now on to my topic today.&nbsp; People.&nbsp; It's funny&nbsp;how when someone gets called out on their shit, someone who is exposed for their true intentions, acts so differently like nothing ever happened.&nbsp; You know what I mean.&nbsp; It's like night and day.&nbsp;&nbsp;First they live in their fantasy world.&nbsp; Then it's back to fucking reality like their little&nbsp;"fantasy" never existed.&nbsp; You know it's there.&nbsp; It's like an old saying my therapist once told me.&nbsp; There's an elephant in the room and nobody wants to talk about it.&nbsp; I learned a lesson&nbsp;yet again from all of this.&nbsp; Don't give yourself to somebody when&nbsp; you don't even know&nbsp;what they are going to do with&nbsp;you.&nbsp; I miss  Danielle . &nbsp;&nbsp; She is in the Poconos right now.&nbsp; Lucky her.&nbsp; My vacation is&nbsp;the first week in August.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no idea what I am going to do.&nbsp; I know&nbsp;one thing.&nbsp; I am not going into work at all!&nbsp; I am going to wrap this one up for tonight.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;I am going to play some&nbsp;video games to get my mind off shit.&nbsp; Comment or something!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The big day is today...&nbsp; The day when the Zone VP comes to my store.&nbsp; I plan on getting in my store by 7 am to do my final touches.&nbsp; I am only still awake because I took a four hour nap when I got home from work.&nbsp; Wish me luck and I will post from work when they leave to tell you how things went.&nbsp; I am their first stop of the day.&nbsp; Yipes!

      There’s a letter on the desktop That I dug out of a drawer The last truce we ever came to In our adolescent war And I start to feel the fever From the warm air through the screen You come regular like seasons Shadowing my dreams  And the mississippi’s mighty But it starts in minnesota At a place that you could walk across With five steps down And I guess that’s how you started Like a pinprick to my heart But at this point you rush right through me And I start to drown  And there’s not enough room In this world for my pain Signals cross and love gets lost And time passed makes it plain Of all my demon spirits I need you the most I’m in love with your ghost I’m in love with your ghost  Dark and dangerous like a secret That gets whispered in a hush (don’t tell a soul) When I wake the things I dreamt about you Last night make me blush (don’t tell a soul) And you kiss me like a lover Then you sting me like a viper I go follow to the river Play your memory like a piper  And I feel it like a sickness How this love is killing me I’d walk into the fingers Of your fire willingly And dance the edge of sanity I’ve never been this close I’m in love with your ghost  Unknowing captor You never know how much you Pierce my spirit But I can’t touch you Can you hear it A cry to be free Oh I’m forever under lock and key As you pass through me  Now I see your face before me I would launch a thousand ships To bring your heart back to my island As the sand beneath me slips As I burn up in your presence And I know now how it feels To be weakened like achilles With you always at my heels  This bitter pill I swallow Is the silence that I keep It poisons me I can’t swim free The river is too deep Though I’m baptized by your touch I am no worse than most In love with your ghost  You are shadowing my dreams (in love with your ghost)

      I have all three.  I am NOT a happy camper.  And on top of it I have three visible cavities.  I am so blah.  Things are better on everything else.  I saw  Danielle  this weekend.  It was good, but I didn't feel good.  We just chilled all weekend.  Work is so hectic.   Joe  and his boss are coming on Thursday or Friday.  Of all weeks for me to get sick.  The store really isn't in bad shape.  I just need to fix some parts of my NR wall and deal with PV overstock.  Sorry this entry is so short, but I am sickly and am going to play a game of Literati with  Danielle  and chill for the rest of the night.  If I feel compelled, I might write something else.

      Yea.  That was number four on my search strings for my webstats.  What the hell??         See what I mean??  Very odd.  Today is the first day of my three day weekend and I am sickly again.  I was supposed to go to cemetary today, but that is out of the question.  My eye was glued shut when I woke up.  I hope it's not pink eye because that would royally suck.  I am hungry.  I don't think there is any food in the house though.  I hate that.  Sorry I am being so random ADD like.  I have a lot on my mind.  Well I am going to get going.  I want to do something.  Something other than type.

      It happened.  I freaked out last night.  Thank satan for  Julie .  I am not going to get into what happened because it is nobody's business, but now it's done.  I am back to my old self again.  For those of you who know me, you know what that means.  I am going away this weekend to see  Danielle .  I miss her dearly.  I haven't really been paying attention to her and for that I am sorry.  I have a sinus headache right now.  And I am at work.  Blech.  I took a random pic of myself being sickly looking.  Here it is for your enjoyment:         Bye for now.

      Here's a nifty little recipe I cooked up:  2 lesbians currently in a relationship 1 that has little self-control 1 that claims to be a good girlfriend 1/2 cup of lust 3/4 teaspoon of attraction 1/2 teaspoon of drama 1 quart of cheating  Stir vigorously until mixed. Bake at 375 degrees until fully aggravated. Serve.  Now you can have your cake and eat it too.

       So I am home from work right now.  I did the new release wall and my schedule and put out a lot of overstock.  Here are the before and after pics:            I rock!

      I don't know.  It sounded like a good title.  I am so retardedly confused about so many things.  Well, not confused because I know what I want, but frustrated might be a better word.  Life is always so difficult for me.  I suppose it's because I make it that way, but still.  I have to be at work at four.  Yea.  I am still in bed and it's three.  LOL.  And Mondays suck.  There is the schedule to do and then the new release wall.  I just have to make room for Butterfly Effect, but I need a whole bay to do so.  Sorry.  Video store talk.  I will take a pic of my handiwork tonight and put it here.  It is so amazing how I can get eight empty rows out of a full wall of movies.  I finally beat  Tiara  at Literati, but then later on in the night she kicked my ass again.  What's going on?!?!?!?!  Well, lemme go because I don't want to be late for work.  And come on people.  Comment on my entries!

      I LOST the Literati best of three against  Tiara .  It was sooooo close.  Now I also lost a bet so now I have to do something for her.  She hasn't decided yet.  I can just imagine!!

      That explains my first customer of my shift today. I usually don't get annoyed by mentally retarded or challenged people, but this one took the cake.  Oh my holy hell.  This is an actual sentence she said over and over again:  "Canyoulookupamovieforme? Iaminarushandtimeistickingticktockticktock."  She like didn't breathe when she talked and mushed everything together and had a lisp.  It was baddddd.  And  Andre  and  Jim  totally abandoned me at the front, so I had no choice but to help her.  She bought Brady Bunch in the White House.  Go figure.  Anyway, I had a cruddy day.  I slept til 2:45 and then showered and went right to work.  My back has been hurting so bad lately.  I routinely take 3 Advil at a time.  That can't be good.  When I get paid, I am going to go to the doctor.  Yay!   Madonna's  song "Frozen" is on.  I love love love that song.  I always wanted to make love to it.  Heh.  Speaking of making love, I need to do that soon.

      I am truly addicted to this little gem of a game on Yahoo.  Me and  Julie  play it like it's going out of style and now I got  Tiara  playing too.  It's so simple yet so challenging.  You should all try it.  My Yahoo username is geekdykegrrl if you ever wanna challenge me.  Heh.  So anyway, it's funny how you are all bajangady with someone one minute and the next it's all good in the hood.  I guess that is how you can tell that person is a true friend.  With all my weird mannerisms and quirks, she still manages to put up with me.  Thanks.  You know who you are.  And if it's not you who is reading this pretend that it's you.  Feel special.

      Work sucks.  I feel as though I am just going through the motions.  Everything is so overwhelming.  I have literally hundreds of previously viewed movies staring me in the face with no place to put them.       See what I mean!   Joe  and his boss are coming on the 12th.  I better get this store in shape.  I am sitting here right now playing Literati with  Julie .  I could be organizing the library.  Nahhhhhhh.  Some other time.

      I have really bad timing.  Like when to oversleep.  I was supposed to be at work an hour ago, but didn't wake up until 12:45.   Joe  is there right now.  I feel like shit because I was up all night working on this new blog.  I still have to get in the shower and leave for work.  I wish I was the cat.   Spencer  is just relaxing now.  Screw him.

      September 11th happens. The country is in turmoil. George W. is reading "My Pet Goat" with a bunch of school children as 3000 people lose their lives. This is the same man who, in his first year in office, was on vacation 42% of the time. He as well as all of us were blindsided by 09.11.01. Two days later on the 13th, Osama's family is allowed to leave the country when all other flights were grounded. Days, weeks, months pass. Osama goes without detection. You think we would have had the prescence of mind to interview his family members before we let them knowingly leave the country? We decide to look for "Weapons of Mass Destruction" in Iraq. We order Iraq to disarm or we will go to war. They don't comply because they have no WMD. We declare war on Iraq to help them "rebuild their government". As much as Saddam was doing bad things to his people, what gives us the authority to deem what is a "proper government"? I don't know if any of you have been paying attention, but our government is n't running very well right now. Exorbinant health care costs, taxes through the roof, and we are fighting a war we shouldn't have even started in the first place.   We've lost more soldiers after the war ended then while the war was going on. Saddam has been captured. No "Weapons of Mass Destruction" have been found. We basically made a fool of ourselves, of our country for a pissing contest. Nobody cares if we are the richest, most powerful country on the world. In my opinion, we are rich with ignorance and power hungry. Why can't we be like Iceland? They don't even have an army. They don't need one. We recently turned over Saddam to his country so they can prosecute him. I feel bad for the man kinda. We pinned the 09.11.01 attacks on him indirectly. The american people were happy to have something, some shread of "revenge" on the Middle East. Our real war should have been with Afghanistan for harboring a terrorist. Osama bin Laden. Who we have yet to find.

      I recently updated my site. I decided to go with this format. I hope all of you like it. It's a lot brighter. So, what's new with all of you guys? I am doing ok. I have been working a lot lately. Me and  Danielle  really haven't seen each other a lot because of her car situation and my work situation. I feel bad for that. I will have to admit that  Tiara  has been mentally distracting me. I need to stop that. I have a girlfriend who loves me very much and I need to remember that. I don't know. I am all bajang. I took next weekend off to get away from things. I don't know what I am going to do yet, but I will figure it out. I am at work right now typing this, so sorry for the choppiness and shortness of this entry.  Well, that is it for now. Visit the forums and post something. TTFN......

      The concert was fucking amazing! I enjoyed all of the craziness that was going on. Every performance was great, but Linkin Park was the best by far. When they played "Breaking the Habit", I acutually started to cry at the beginning. I am so glad that I have my LP tattoo. I am going to post some pics from the concert. The first one is of me just having fun and it came out really good so I didn't want you guys to miss out on it. The second one was of me and  Julie  being silly. Then it's me again in the bathroom being all blee. Finally is a pic of  Chester  from LP I took when he was on the huge screen above us. Enjoy!
