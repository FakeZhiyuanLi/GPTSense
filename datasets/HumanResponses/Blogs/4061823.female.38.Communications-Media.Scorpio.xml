      The Movie:   Casablanca , 1942 (Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch, screenwriters; Michael Curtiz, dir.) Who says it:  Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, head of the local police The context:  Renault has just seen Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) shoot Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), the head of the Third Reich’s occupying force in Casablanca. How to use it:  When you know perfectly well who's responsible for a mistake, but you have no plans to seek retribution.  This line has become so overused that it's lost its true meaning, although its use as a movie title ( The Usual Suspects ) was exactly right.    Almost all of  Casablanca  has passed into everyday conversation.  Renault has the movie's other best line, though: "I am shocked,  shocked  to find that gambling is going on in here!" right before someone hands him his winnings.    Preparing for the move requires small things as well as large.  Yesterday I touched up my hair color -- yes, everyone is shocked,  shocked  to learn I'm not a natural blonde.  My friend Joanne suggested, when I saw her in Washington last month, that I might want to be a little less blonde in Maine... and then, earlier this week, my friend Adrienne's nine-year-old son said bluntly: "Your hair funny."  He's still learning English, so I'd like to believe what he really meant was "pretty," or "striking," but I try to deceive myself only about big things.    So I'm a little less blonde today than I was yesterday.  It's one more step in abandoning southern California.

      What's great about moving is that it forces me to get in touch with friends and family members I've neglected, especially those who are going to be near my new home or along my travel route.  Last night I spent an hour on the phone with my old friend, client and partner-in-crime Tom Ehrenfeld, author of  The Startup Garden .  Tom and his family live in Cambridge, MA, and I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more of them once I'm in Maine.  Tom and I have been talking for a while about putting together a novelty book called  You Talking to Me?   This would be an overview of the best movie quotations of all time, with suggestions for appropriate ways to use them in conversations.  Neither of us has had time to pursue this, but Tom came up with a great idea: I could put one a day on this blog, and at the end of a year (or even before that), the book would be written.    The title, of course, is self-explanatory.

      My beloved former housemates, Ashton and Joseph, are coming to Los Angeles on August 7 to help me pack.  I am so grateful to them I could wash their feet with my salty tears.    Tears are alarmingly close a good deal of the time these days.  Sleep deprivation doesn't help, either.

       Thank God July has 31 days.&nbsp; Unfortunately, only three of these days are left in the month... and only another 15 until my self-imposed departure date.&nbsp;    I'll use this blog as a travel journal for the trip cross-country to Maine.&nbsp; Over time, I'd like it to evolve into a site for me to post answers to questions that come up in my work, research I find especially interesting, and grammar rules I'd like to see enforced more stringently.&nbsp; It will feed my illusion that anyone is paying attention.  I've yet to do any packing.&nbsp; My goal for the weekend is to sort through my belongings and pull out everything that needs to be given away or thrown away.&nbsp; I have suits I haven't worn since I left Washington, and there are women who could use them.&nbsp;   There isn't really a direct route from Los Angeles to Central Maine, so I'm planning the trip to let me see as many friends as possible along the way.&nbsp; The planned route is:  August 15: Los Angeles to Flagstaff, AZ August 16: Flagstaff to Pagosa Springs, CO August 17: Pagosa Springs to Denver, CO August 18: Denver to Lincoln, NE August 19: Lincoln to St. Louis, MO August 20: St. Louis to Chicago, IL August 21: Chicago to Pittsburgh, PA August 22: Pittsburgh to Newport, RI August 23: Newport to China, ME  The longest single day of driving will be Pittsburgh to Newport; if I'm too tired, I may stop off in Dutchess County, NY and throw myself on the mercy of the McLaughlins there.  (Westchester Lambs: I'm sorry I won't see you on this trip, but I'll be in New York in October, and hope to see you then.)     My pointer-lab mix, Dizzy, has never made a trip like this before.&nbsp; I'll be staying with friends and relatives on most of these stops, but suggestions for dog-friendly motels along the way are welcome.&nbsp;

      The Movie:   Caddyshack , 1980 (Brian Doyle-Murray, Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney, screenwriters; Harold Ramis, dir.) Who says it:  Bill Murray as groundskeeper Carl Spackler The context:  This is the end of a long story Carl tells about the time he caddied for the Dalai Lama.  The Dalai Lama didn’t give him a tip, but promised him total consciousness on his deathbed. How to use it:  To count your blessings, or acknowledge the bright side of an otherwise disappointing situation.  Murray plays Carl with a strong lateral lisp, something I’ve spent most of my life trying to get rid of.  Things I have going for me: plenty of work, a remarkably tolerant landlady, a family that's actually functional, endlessly patient friends, and a faithful dog.    I don't think I could handle total consciousness, I'm too anxious already.

      The Movie:   American Beauty , 1999 (Alan Ball, screenwriter; Sam Mendes, dir.) Who says it:  Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, a man whose midlife crisis turns out to be an end-of-life crisis. The context:  Burnham says this in voiceover at the end of the film, which has just shown us the circumstances of his death. How to use it:  Whenever you need to remind yourself it’s a world of wonders.  If I keep saying this, it'll eventually sink in.    The latest on my car is that it won't be ready until  September 7 .  I'm officially homeless after August 31.  The car sat unattended for a week before the insurance adjuster even got around to looking at it.  So I keep saying "This  cannot be ," which has no effect on anyone or anything.    Living without a car in Los Angeles is a novelty at first, and then it's just tedious.  I spent most of yesterday morning taking a variety of buses to and from Westwood.  I don't really mind the bus, because it's good reading time -- yesterday I got through most of KJ Erickson's latest novel, which is excellent, and a screenplay that was so bad I couldn't believe anyone had paid money for it.    In his monologue  Monster in a Box , Spalding Gray talked about trying to mount a project called "L.A.: The Other," about the people in Los Angeles who weren't part of the entertainment industry.  He decided he would find these people riding the buses.  The punchline of the story was that even people on the buses had screenplays to pitch (although what they really wanted to do was direct).  Mom's doing okay, at least.

      The Movie:   Barton Fink , 1991 (Joel and Ethan Coen, screenwriters; Joel Coen, dir.) Who says it:  John Goodman as Charlie “Madman” Mundt, a traveling salesman The context:  Charlie rooms next door to Barton Fink (John Turturro), a playwright struggling to write a screenplay.  Barton patronizes Charlie with rants about art and the life of the mind, not knowing that Charlie keeps his own terrible secret.  Charlie says this line as he strides through a burning hotel hallway, shotgun over his arm.   How to use it:	With a wild look in your eye, to deflate anyone who’s spouting pseudo-intellectual garbage.  People should say it to me more often.  Throughout all this car nonsense, friends have said to me, "Things could be worse."  I know they mean that it's better that the car got disemboweled here, rather than somewhere in the Rocky Mountains.  But "things could be worse" has always sounded more like a threat to me than a consolation -- I  know  that things could be worse, I know  exactly  how things could be worse, and I pray constantly that these things I imagine don't come to pass.    So now things are worse.  My mom went back into the hospital yesterday for what they think is pneumonia.  This seems to be treatable and everyone is talking about when she'll be home, so it's true that this is not as bad as it might be.  But please, please, please do not tempt fate by telling me that things could be worse.  My car can spontaneously combust and all my possessions can get buried in an earthquake, as long as Mom's okay.

      The Movie:   Sunset Blvd ., 1950 (Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, screenwriters; Billy Wilder, dir.) Who says it:  Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a silent movie star The context:  Desmond’s lover, hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden), has just been found dead in Desmond’s swimming pool; Desmond mistakes the newsreel cameras for a movie set. How to use it:  To admit that you’re probably deceiving yourself about your central role in any given situation.  The big danger of having a blog is thinking that anyone is paying attention.  I didn't stop to think, when I set this up, that it would make me part of an emerging subculture, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.  I guess it's flattering to be getting comments from total strangers who happen upon the blog, but I feel the same way I'd feel if someone came up to me in a store and made an off-color remark, or started swearing without checking to make sure I wouldn't mind.  So hey: if I don't know you, please don't make suggestive comments, and less of the f-word, please.  My mom reads this.  Yesterday I read an angry column by an author I admire, in which he postulated that only losers need websites, and the bigger the website, the bigger the loser (I'm paraphrasing).  Of course I immediately felt that I should send this man an e-mail to apologize and justify my own  urlLink website  (early training dies hard).  I didn't, because I don't know him and he doesn't know me.  But I still feel anxious about it.

      The Movie:   The Manchurian Candidate , 1962 (George Axelrod, screenwriter; John Frankenheimer, dir.) Who says it:  Frank Sinatra as Major Bennett Marco; James Edwards as Corporal Alvin Melvin The context:  Marco and the other unit members can’t help saying this every time Shaw’s name comes up, even though they remember Shaw being a jerk. How to use it:  To acknowledge that you’re being brainwashed.  This line comes up less frequently in Jonathan Demme's remake, which I saw yesterday.  The remake is a good movie, completely different from the original in tone and maybe even in message.  In the original movie, this line becomes funny -- funny in a dark, mean way -- but the remake has very little humor in it.  It feels strange to be in Los Angeles this week, when I'd planned to be gone.  Good, but strange.

      The Movie:   Monty Python and the Holy Grail , 1975 (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones & Michael Palin, screenwriters; Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, dir.) Who says it:  John Cleese as The Black Knight The context:  He’s just had his arm cut off, and blood is spurting from the wound. How to use it:  To express lunatic courage and gallantry.  Today's quotation is in honor of my friend Randy White and all of the other survivors of Hurricane Charley.  The devastation is mind-boggling and heart-breaking.  Randy, through some combination of bravery and insanity, rode the storm out in his 1920s-era Cracker stilt house, built on an old Calusa mound on Pine Island.  Amazingly, his DSL never went down, so you can read his account of the storm on his website,  urlLink www.docford.com .  If you don't already read his books, go buy a couple just to encourage him.  You can also make a donation to the disaster relief fund  urlLink here .  Several friends have been sending me Python lines for this blog, so this won't be the last one I post.  In fact, the guys in my  urlLink college theater group   proved on more than one occasion that it's possible to talk for hours and never say anything that  isn't  a Python quotation.

      The Movie:  Animal House , 1978 (Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney & Chris Miller, screenwriters; John Landis, dir.) Who says it:  John Vernon as Dean Vernon Wormer The context:  Wormer is threatening Delta House pledge Kent “Flounder” Dorfman (Stephen Furst) with expulsion. How to use it: Good advice for everyone, although I do okay on two out of the three.    I had a different quotation ready for today, but this line popped into my head yesterday afternoon, when I was waiting to buy a movie ticket behind an incredibly obnoxious guy who seemed to be channeling Andrew Dice Clay.  (Actually, this is Hollywood; maybe he  was  Andrew Dice Clay.)  Tempted as I was, I didn't say this line out loud.    Now that I am stuck here for another two weeks, I have time for things like movies again.  I'm about 70% packed, I'm pretty well caught up on my work projects, and not having a car gives me an excuse to avoid any errand I don't feel like running.  It's like being given a couple of weeks of vacation.  My cousin Sheila and her husband Greg had everyone over last night for Greek  mezze  and the Olympic opening ceremonies.  God forbid I ever stop feeling impressed about the Olympics, but why were the American athletes dressed like 1980s breakdancers?    Julia Child's family has asked that people around the world lift a glass to her tonight at 8:00 p.m. local time.  I don't know what else I'll be doing tonight, but that's definitely on my list.

      Okay, so my car won't be ready until the end of the month.  This is absurdly frustrating, but it'll work out fine, because now I can go to my cousin Jean's wedding along the way.    The revised itinerary -- subject to further change, of course -- will look like this:  September 1: Los Angeles to Flagstaff, AZ September 2: Flagstaff to Pagosa Springs, CO September 3: Pagosa Springs to Vail, CO September 4: Jean's wedding September 5: Recovering from Jean's wedding and hanging out with the Lambs September 6: Vail to Lincoln, NE September 7: Lincoln to St. Louis, MO September 8: St. Louis to Chicago, IL September 9: Chicago to Pittsburgh, PA September 10: Pittsburgh to Newport, RI September 11: Newport to China, ME  I think it's a good omen that I'll get to Maine on September 11.

      The Movie:   The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension , 1984 (Earl Mac Rauch, screenwriter; W.D. Richter, dir.) Who says it:  Peter Weller as Dr. Buckaroo Banzai, neurosurgeon, physicist, martial-arts expert and rock musician The context:  Banzai is chiding his band’s audience for booing a young woman whose unhappiness has interrupted the show.   How to use it:  This is a Buddhist koan as well as a movie quotation, so it’s pretty much all-purpose.  When I moved to Los Angeles five years ago, I had a fancier version of this line scrawled across my Day-Timer, a line from Horace: “ Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt ,” which means, “Crossing the sea changes the sky, not the soul.”  And that’s true, but I do think that making radical changes allows people a better view of their souls.  Unless you’re a sociopath, your life is very much shaped by other people’s expectations.  This isn’t a bad thing -- the world doesn’t need any more sociopaths -- but radical changes are a chance to figure out what really matters to you, rather than what other people say should matter.    Last night at Barney's was a great time.  I was so glad to see everyone, and I just wish I'd had more time to talk to people individually.  Of course, since I still don't have any idea of when my car will be fixed, perhaps I will be talking to  everyone  individually very soon, begging for temporary shelter.  That's a joke, Mom.  I think.

      The Movie:   Beyond the Valley of the Dolls , 1970 (Roger Ebert, screenwriter; Russ Meyer, dir.)  Who says it:  John LaZar as Ronnie “Z-Man” Barzell, a Phil Spector-esque impresario/producer The context:  Barzell walks into his own wild, swinging party, which is full of beautiful people and freaks. How to use it:  To take credit for a situation that could turn out to be a great time.   Beyond the Valley of the Dolls  may be the most influential bad movie ever made.  Among other things, it’s the source of the immortal line “Don’t bogart the joint!”  Not that I know what that means.  References to  BVD  pop up all over the place, from Austin Powers to Kevin Smith’s movies.  This line is also used in a song by one of my favorite bands (now broken up), Too Much Joy.    The kids’ cartoon “Scooby Doo” started right around the time  BVD  was being filmed, and while “Scooby Doo” is supposedly based on a series of Enid Blyton novels, I defy anyone to watch the opening scenes of  BVD  and not think of The Mystery Machine.  In fact, the original name of Daphne’s character was Kelly, which is also the lead character’s name in  BVD .  Coincidence?

      The Movie:   Chinatown , 1974 (Roman Polanski, dir.) Who says it:  Joe Mantell as LAPD Detective Lawrence Walsh The context:  It’s the last line of the movie, said to private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson).  Gittes has just witnessed the murder of the woman he loves, and seen the man responsible drive away unpunished with his next victim.   How to use it:	In acknowledgement that some things don't change, despite your best efforts.      Due to a series of miscommunications and snafus, it looks as if my car will not be fixed until sometime early next week -- which pushes my departure date back from Sunday.  I'll know more later in the day.  This means that in all likelihood I won't get to Maine in time to see my friends the Schulzes, who'll be visiting from Munich.  Overlapping with their visit was the whole point of my scheduling the move for mid-August, so it's especially frustrating.  I'll just have to do another of my bad-weather visits to Europe this winter... at least getting to Germany from Maine is much easier than from California.    A few people out here have said to me, "Well, this is what you get for trying to schedule a move when Mercury's retrograde."  I had never even heard of Mercury retrograde until I moved to California, and it cracks me up to hear people talking about it as if it's a genuine meteorological phenomenon.  I even say it myself, because it's become synonymous in my mind with Murphy's Law.  But if astrology had any legitimacy at all, wouldn't my twin sister and I be much more alike?  And wouldn't my brother Ed, born on our sisters Peggy & Susan's first birthday, be just like them?    I know I will hear from a couple of people about this... watch this space for rational explanations, if I get any.

      The Movie:   This is Spinal Tap , 1984 (Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Rob Reiner, screenwriters; Rob Reiner, dir.) Who says it:  Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel, rock legend The context:  Tufnel is showing documentarian Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) his customized amplifier, with dials that go to eleven instead of ten.  This is Tufnel’s response when DiBergi asks why they didn’t just make the “10” setting louder. How to use it:  When other people don’t understand how cool something is.  Or maybe just when the music’s very loud.  Few things could be louder or cooler than The Who at the Hollywood Bowl, which I saw last night.  I'm a little deaf and a little hoarse this morning.  I'd like to believe that gives me something in common with Pete Townshend.  The ticket was a present from Gary -- my gratitude toward him, for this and everything, will never end.    The Hollywood Bowl is as close as Los Angeles gets to a small town.  We got there and almost immediately saw my high school boyfriend, Steve, who is also Gary's cousin and oldest friend.  Steve was there with his fiancee, Sherril.  Twenty-some years ago Gary and Steve and I were driving around downtown Norfolk in somebody's father's car, and the fact that we were all together at the Hollywood Bowl last night seemed almost miraculous.    Townshend and Daltrey are close to my parents' age, but they too seem almost miraculous.  Roger can still hit that high shrieking note in "Won't Get Fooled Again," and Pete can still jump high in the air without missing a chord.  The lyrics have a different meaning coming from the lungs of 60-year-old men, and I find that profoundly moving.    Seeing them on a stage together reminds me that the great compensation of getting older is being able to measure friendships in decades.  I can't pack my friends in boxes, but I'm taking them along anyway.

      The Movie:   Young Frankenstein , 1974 (Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, screenwriters; Mel Brooks, dir.) Who says it:  Marty Feldman as Igor (Eye-gor), Frankenstein’s assistant The context:  Igor and Dr. Frankenstein are robbing a grave, and Frankenstein says it’s a filthy job.  Immediately after Igor says this, it starts raining. How to use it:  In acceptance of the fact that whatever you’re doing is about to get worse.  It's most effective in a Cockney accent, but don't try it if you can't really do one.  An inexplicable cheerfulness takes over once you realize there's no way out of a miserable situation.  And it's hardly likely to rain here today.

      The Movie:   The Wizard of Oz , 1939 (Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf, screenwriters; Victor Fleming, dir.) Who says it:  Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, revealing the secret of the ruby slippers; Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale, trying to get home from Oz The context:  After Dorothy has made her way to Oz, met the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, and defeated the Wicked Witch of the West, she learns that she had the power to get home to Kansas all along, if only she'd known the magic words. How to use it:  To remind yourself that you probably have everything you need, if you take the time to figure it out.  Instead of ruby slippers, I have car insurance.  What an amazing invention.  And thanks to Kathleen & Mark, Gary, my mom, my sister Kathy and Greg at Santa Monica Volkswagen for pointing out that this sort of thing IS usually covered by comprehensive policies.  Sheesh.  All that drama for nothing -- although without the drama, where's the movie?  Home is where the people you love best love you too.  I am very, very glad to have Ashton & Joseph here this weekend to bring a little bit of my Washington home with them.

      The Movie:   Blade Runner , 1982 (Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples, screenwriters; Ridley Scott, dir.) Who says it:  Brion James as Leon, a replicant The context:  Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a “blade runner” hunting down five renegade replicants who are trying to extend their lifespans.  Since the replicants want to live, they start hunting him.   How to use it: 	Whenever violence isn’t an option, even against oneself.  The more cheerful your delivery, the more effective it is.  My friend Gary uses it all the time to express rage and frustration in a deceptively humorous way.  Use common sense, though – don’t say this line in post offices, high schools or anywhere else it might be taken seriously.    Yesterday I was driving down Wilshire Boulevard, taking my dog and my cousin Kathleen to Kathleen's house so that Dizzy could play with Kathleen's son (my godson) Owen, and we hit a pothole.  It was a bad jolt, but no worse than other potholes I've hit; I drive a VW Beetle, they're low enough to the ground that you feel every bump.  But an hour or so later, when Dizzy and I got ready to go home, I could not make the car move.  The engine started, and sounded fine; the car would not go forward or backward in any gear.  Of course I had gone out without my AAA card, or even my driver's license -- careless, careless -- but Kathleen had the number for AAA and they agreed to send someone out.  Kathleen's husband Mark noticed a pool of fluid underneath the car, and tried adding oil.  No use.    Two tow trucks came and went, saying that they could not tow a Beetle with a regular truck, but needed a flatbed.  Two hours later AAA told me they couldn't find a flatbed to send over, but could schedule a pickup for 8:00 the next morning (today).  My friend Maeve came by and gave Dizzy and me a ride home, which was all the nicer since she doesn't like to have Dizzy in her car.    So this morning I was back at my car before 8:00 a.m., and AAA called to say that they still couldn't find a flatbed but that there really wasn't any reason a regular tow truck couldn't take the car.  In fact, when the regular tow truck showed up, he had no problem hooking up the car.    And all this would have been bad enough, but the punch line of the story is the repair bill, a matter of some $2,100.  Twenty-one hundred dollars.  Two thousand, one hundred dollars.  From a pothole.  "Time to die!"  Update 3:36 p.m. ... did I say $2100?  HA!  Greg at Santa Monica Volkswagen just called to say so sorry, but the transmission needs to be replaced.  Bringing our grand total to $4,495... plus tax.  Selling every drop of blood in my body wouldn't earn me $4,495.  My broken car is worth more money than I am.

      The Movie:   L.A. Story , 1991 (screenwriter: Steve Martin; Mick Jackson, director) Who says it:  Victoria Tennant as Sara McDowel, a British journalist visiting Los Angeles; Steve Martin as Harris K. Telemacher, a local TV weatherman; an electronic highway billboard.   The context:	Sara says it first, repeating something a rollerskater told her; the highway billboard says it just before Harris kisses Sara for the first time. How to use it:  Any time you’re overthinking the situation.  For me, this is most of the time.   L. A. Story  is my favorite movie about Los Angeles, and probably my favorite Steve Martin movie as well.  (Top five movies about L.A.:  Chinatown ,  Grand Canyon ,  L.A. Story ,  Singing in the Rain , and  Sunset Boulevard .  Do not harass me with pleas for  Swingers ,  L.A. Confidential , or  The Player ; all good movies, but not in my top five.)  Anyway, I love  L. A. Story  because it captures the process of falling in love – with a person, with a city – better than any movie I can think of.  It’s all about that moment of surprise, when you look at the person or the place and think, “You are not what I expected at all.”  Suddenly all kinds of possibilities present themselves, and you can’t think of anything you’d rather do than spend the rest of your life exploring them.    My own belief is that almost any person or place is capable of surprising you like that.  It’s probably why I’m not married.  It’s certainly part of why I’m moving, to look for new surprises.

      The Movie:   Hannah and Her Sisters , 1986 (Woody Allen, screenwriter and director) Who says it:  Woody Allen as Mickey Sachs, a hypochondriac TV producer who makes it through a health crisis to fall in love with his ex-wife’s sister.  This is the movie’s last line, and the moral of the story. How to use it:	Whenever all the drama seems too much to bear, and to remind yourself that while sorrow is inevitable, heartbreak isn't permanent.    It’s remarkable how people –- I, specifically –- chase down new opportunities for heartache, as if everyday life didn’t throw enough at us.  I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, and it seems to me that all this emotional recklessness is a modern evolutionary compensation for the fact that we’re not physically running away from tigers anymore.  If I had to duck mammoth stampedes on a regular basis, I would not need to make myself sad – or happy, or excited, or fearful, or anything – by leaving one group of friends and family, wreaking havoc with my possessions, and hurling myself from one side of the country to the other.   For better or worse, mammoths are extinct.

      The Movie:   Moonstruck , 1987 (John Patrick Shanley, screenwriter; Norman Jewison, dir.) Who says it:  Cher as Loretta Castorini, a widow disillusioned with love The context:  Loretta smacks Ronny Cammareri (Nicolas Cage), her brother’s fiancé, when Ronny tells Loretta he loves her.   How to use it:	To shock someone out of a fantasy, or put a stop to embarrassing sentimentality.  Don't actually slap anyone, though.   I  need to snap out of it.  The other day I stood paralyzed in front of the dairy case, thinking that if I bought the half-gallon of skim milk (instead of the quart), it would be the last jug of milk I’d buy in Los Angeles.  Had I not been surrounded by people, I’d have smacked myself and shouted this.  Since my health insurance doesn’t cover mental illness, I let the opportunity pass.  Bye-bye, Alta Dena Dairy.

      The Movie:   The Empire Strikes Back (Star Wars: Episode V) , 1980 (Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, screenwriters; George Lucas, dir.) Who says it:  Frank Oz as Yoda, the Jedi master  The context:  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has traveled to Dagobah to complete his training as a Jedi knight, where Yoda teaches him the nuances of the Force.   How to use it:  Whenever facing an apparently impossible task.  All-purpose inspiration and encouragement.  Today's quotation is honor of my nephew George, who turns 17 today.  Happy birthday, George.  I won't waste your time with advice, but I'll wish you the things I treasure most in all my friends -- curiosity, generosity and courage -- and I send you prayers for a long and useful life.  Oh, and a real present's in the mail.  See you soon.

      The Movie:  A Fish Called Wanda , 1988 (John Cleese, screenwriter; Charles Crichton, dir.) Who says it:  John Cleese as Archie Leach, a barrister-turned-fugitive The context:  Leach is trying to get Ken (Michael Palin), a stutterer, to reveal the location of the safety deposit box that holds a cache of diamonds.  He knows never to rush a stutterer, but he’s frantic. How to use it:	To manage your own anxiety about running out of time, or to hurry other people along without being too obnoxious.  You have to say it in a musical tone of voice, and "plenty" has three syllables.  My friend Sue says this at least once a day, I think, when she's in an English-speaking environment.    Since I woke up a little after 4:00 this morning, at some primal level I obviously don't feel I have plenty of time.  With luck, I have  enough  time.  Time to murder and create, as T.S. Eliot says, and time yet for a hundred visions and revisions before the taking of a toast and tea.    I like toast, but I'm not as passionate about it as my brother Ed -- who nearly wept when he clicked the "toast" page on Jasper Fforde's website (www.thursdaynext.com) and discovered it was a joke.  Am I a little scattered today?  Welcome to my world.

      The Movie:   Airplane , 1980 (Zucker, Zucker and Abrahams, screenwriters and directors) Who says it:  Lloyd Bridges as Steve McCroskey, an air traffic controller The context:  McCroskey is trying to bring down a jetliner whose crew has succumbed to food poisoning.  The only passenger who can fly the plane is Ted Striker (Robert Hays), a veteran pilot paralyzed by his wartime memories.  In earlier scenes, McCroskey says it’s the wrong week to quit smoking, drinking and amphetamines. How to use it:	Under extreme stress.  This line does not constitute permission to resume sniffing glue.  This blog cannot be responsible for your bad life decisions.  Quitting anything is just about impossible for me, so I often feel grateful that I never really wanted to smoke or do drugs.    But now that it's August 1 -- two weeks away from my move date -- I'm quitting things whether I want to or not.  This morning was probably my last Sunday Mass at St. Ambrose (I can't see dragging Ashton & Joseph there next week).  The readings were a little too appropriate -- "Vanity, vanity, all is vanity," and the parable about the man who built an extra storehouse for his grain and then died that night.  No one ever thinks of themselves as acquisitive until it's time to pack it all up, which forces the question, "How the hell did I get all this stuff?"  By the end of this week, I will  wish  I sniffed glue.
