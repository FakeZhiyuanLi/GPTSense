      Summer is tiring. REALLY tiring. There's so much to do and I can't do it all! Man. I don't even want to type this entry, but I feel so out of it when I don't.  This will have to suffice for now.

      Well, Sunday's show was so fun! Even though I kept getting mad at the drums (I could barely hear them and I kept messing up and getting angry!) we all played pretty well, Patrick's voice sounded good, Jamie's solos were awesome. Everlasting Glow came first place, Ten Dollar Thompson came second, and Solemn Fist (RICHMOND REPRESENT!!) came third. We had a good time on stage and got to meet the other bands and give each other advice. It was pretty awesome. Except that in the band room upstairs there was a bed...WHY WAS THERE A BED UP THERE I ASK YOU!!  Anyway, takin a bit of a break this week to just relax and enjoy the sun. Tonight Stef and I will be going to see Shamble play at Tynnehead Hall (I think) in Surrey, so that'll be interesting. Salmon Festival tomorrow! Canada Day woo!! That's always fun. Too bad the Garry Point fireworks aren't happening this year...or so I hear. Narcis, Karmacanix, Second, Ether's Void (with their new bassist!) and Rally Car are all playing in the Steveston field tomorrow, so everyone come check it out, it's free! And play some games and eat some salmon while you're at it. I'm not a fan of salmon...  Next Friday, Free Parking is playing at the Stardust Battle Of The Bands Finals, and it's $7.50 with a discount card from one of the bands. Otherwise I think it's $10...but it'll be a good show. You should all go. GO!  I still have to talk to that guy about buying his double kick. SO CLOSE to getting a double kick, SO CLOSE.  That is all for now! Stay tuned!

      This part of the summer is truly when the confusion kicks in to summer. How so? Well, I was told that we might be going to the beach on Wed. It is that day today and I have no clue what's going on, and people want me to play hockey. What to do? I really don't know. The summer definitely has it's times like these, and it confuses the crap out of me, because I easily get confused. Another thing is I never have a good tow course meal. My parents leave no food in the house so I pretty much starve. Being hungry really sucks too! Especially when your waiting to find out if were going to the beach.   I guess it comes back to me being out of the loop in a way. I think. It always seems I'm the last person to know about things and I'm pretty much doing nothing all day so anyone can call me or anything. Sure, it does have to do with me being lazy and not calling people but I truly dislike phoning people. It's really weird, a Robson gene I'm guessing, because I hate calling people. I love getting phone calls,  but calling no. Yes, another weird characteristic of me.   One thing that kind of made me a little disappointed was the camp cabins. When Matt, Nick and Dyllan wrote down who they wanted in their cabin, none of them put my name in. I mean, I am the rookie, it's not like I'm going to know everyone there.   Once again, I blame my absence in Richmond. I'm not in the neighborhood so no one comes to me house and says lets go out. I'm not in Richmond so the thought of involving me sometimes slips their mind, not because they don't like me, but because I'm too far away or they just simply forget. I'm not blaming my friends, I would never do that, it's just I sit hear bored in my house with nothing else to do but talk about my boredom.   So yeah I was bored last night and I couldn't get to sleep so I thought I would practice my golf swing. I ended up breaking the ceiling fan! Ha! Oh it was funny but I think I just broke the light bulb cause I replaced it and it works again. Oh well, that's what happens when your bored...

      Guys I hate to be lame and post on a blog about my other blog...but you guys will dig this: urlLink  A post about Andy!  I promise you, no more lame posts like this.   Have you guys also checked out the MSN group for RPC Youth?  urlLink  It is here  and has some cool stuff, like pictures, and the latest "Slamball: Vincent Edition" updates. Intense reading guys.  Sometimes I get the feeling that that MSN group has a lot of potential fun, but it's just not given the proper publicity it needs... people need to know the URL and it needs to be flashy and have random pictures in places. But I guess they don't allow you to edit the source much, crazy MSNers.

      Well, I'm not sure what to think about my report card. I've never seen an F on one  of my report cards. I saw it coming, it shoul;dn't be a surprise, but somehow it still hurts. So yeah, I passed Math and French, which is a huge victory. I went to go tell my conselor about droping a course next year to take eart science (the easiest science) when I came across a problem. Turns out eart science is full,so I gotta take BIO now!!! Noooooooo!!!! Just as I thought everthing was going as planned, it some how jumps the tracks. Well, i guess its not that bad. But wasn't planning on taking Bio.   So how on earth did the Liberals win again? That's insane! Notice how the conservatives won almost all the western provinces yet they still lost? Shows how much the east dominates the west.

      What's up with players I like? Poor Lalime was traded and now Geoff is gone! So disapointing. Anywho...  Sunday was fun, we went to Timmy Ho's and Dyllan came, it was good times. Of course Nick and Dyllan had some good coments on Anne being at my place Sunday by herself, and no one else. We all had a good laugh, except I turned all red. Then Dyllan and I took a walk and we had a good chat and I really enjoyed that.   Today was watetmania and that was pretty cool. I got to chill with Nellisa and we really don't talk much so that was pretty cool. Yep Yep  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looking forward to Canada Day. It's gonna be AWSOME!

      All-Nighter 2004: officially complete. It was a success, with a few minor set-backs, but we're alright.  After I got home, I showered, slept from 8:30 AM 'till 11 AM, and then I got up. Everyone else slept 'till afternoon (at least) or like, 4 PM or something. But yeah, I got up and ran the rest of the day on two and a half hours of sleep. Not bad, if I may say so. But yes, I woke up, had lunch with Sam at the mall, and then postered stuff with Mikey.  All in all, a rad day.    Message to MATT: I would LOVE to go to your house to make lunch tomorrow. I'll have to check with the 'rents though, since I'm already out in Vancouver tomorrow evening. (Mesa Luna thing.) Speaking of which, Dyllan's apparently not going.

      So the best part of the all nighter was after are conversation we met with the girls and Steph came up and said "We Talked About Sex" in like the funniest way. I can't remember how but it was soooooooo funny!  Anywho, when your tired, everything seems extra long. While walking to No 3 I thought I was there, I wasn't even half way!!! Everything seemed to crawl!!! I was like, oh well, 7:30 in the morning on a Saturday, I'll have the B Line to myself!. YEAH RITE! It was full!!! Where are people going at this time? It's a Saturday!! Sleep in! The walk from 70th to my house was even worse, because I just wanted to be home, NOW!  I got home and I closed all the blinds and curtains in my house and turned my living room into my bed room. I couldn't really sleep so I brouth the PS2 up, yes I wasn't sick of it yet, and played a game of hockey. Sure enough, it worked! I went right to sleep and woke up at 4! It was a great sleep!  So now I sit at home with nothing to do because I don't want to call others yet because they might still be sleeping. Anywho, if your bored, call me, or message me, anything!  Attention JC and fellow Bloggers! I propose lunch at my house Sunday after church! It would be fun! My nice cozy house all to ourselves and I could cook! Haha! yeah right. But if interested, let me know!

      Matt, your question reminds me much of a question I asked myself as I moved out of home; "When is a good time to call home?" The answer that I gave myself was "Never". I hated home. Going to college was the out. I didn't have to deal with anyone! It was truly great. I went almost a month and a half without calling.   The question you need to ask yourself is "Am I (enter stop mom's name here)'s child, or is (enter step mom's name here) my Dad's wife?" What this means is...from HER point of view. Is her priority to her children, or to her husband, or is it balanced? Are her nagging endeavours motivated by mischief or by nature to protect, nurture?   These questions are easy to answer while emotioned... "She's just a lame bitch that wants to ride my ass all day. She's no good anywhere." I know what that feels like. But don't be disceved. This may not be your step-mom.  I don't know what it's like to lose family. I can imagine that you must feel something akin to how invasive her presence is, that she doesn't belong there. Just know that no one can ever replace your Mom, no one will ever be the same that she was. Your step-mom is a completely different person.   "You don't know someone till you walk a mile in their shoes". Tell me you all know where that comes from...  Put yourself in her shoes. You are your step-mom. Are you a mom, or are you a wife?

      I really do dislike my Step Mom. I've seen her probably less then an hour since she has got back from her trip (which was Sunday) and I try not to think about it, but it's so hard when she keeps on bugging me!! I just don't know what to do. The worst part is it reminds me just how much I miss my mom and I go to bed crying. Is it really that bad? Well, depends from your point of view, some stuff just really annoys me. It has to be her way. It can't be done a diferent way because it has to be done her way, because she is so smart and her way is the best. It's so frustrating, it really is. I just want to do something to really make her... I dunno, show her how I feel. I know, I'm a christian, I shouldn't hate her, but its hard, it really is. Now I have a question, for anybody to answer. Say I've just started my life career and my dad passes away. Do i stay in contact with her? Do I really want to. I mean, she has done many nice things, but it's what the average mom should do. Just all the bad times come back. Do I call her once a month? Or like Christman and Thanksgiving? Fred himself doesn't even talk to her, just my dad. I think the Fire of hate for her still burns. And as for Sarah, I never think they will bee on even terms. I really hope none of you guys have to, or ever have to go through what I have had to go through. I mean, at 8 years old until now is pretty hard to deal with, the older it gets the easier it is.   Anywho, enough with the depresion, I just like to get feelings outta my head. Nobody really is posting much. People busy with summer and exams I guess. Today kinda sucked. Work was a repeat of yesterday, and then I just played hockey and have sat home here. But anywho, going to the beach tomorrow, YAY!   Don't forget to Answer the question! It really is one I've asked myself...for along time, input would kinda be nice, espesialy with the great wisdom from  ANDREW .(Hope You Caught That). Yay beach!!!!!!!

      So Tuesdat night is killing me at work. My boss has made me do some stupid thing I've never done, and It was soooooo bad! I was feeling like crap! I needed a boost from anyone. Sure enough, I saw Vincent. The guy who sometimes drives me nuts was there to make me feel better. I came up to him and said hey hows the game going? He was like oh it good man in his usual hows it going voice. We talked a bit and just as I left he said "Good Job With The Sales Man!". Oh man, I was sooooo happy, just that small boost helped me carry on through the pointless night. It's amazing what a little bit of  a boost can do.

      I DID MY CHEM AND MATH EXAMS TODAY! HURRAH! Obviously, I don't know what I'm got on them just yet, but I don't care, I DON'T NEED TO EVER DO ANOTHER ONE OF THESE CLASSES AGAIN!! FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!!  MY WHOLE LIFE!!  That DOES feel good.  I made two mix CDs. One yesterday and one today. It made me happy. I designed a rad cover for both of them, with the track listing on it and a super awesome title for each CD. And then I finished burning the CDs and write the title on the CD with a  Sharpie marker , in neat little  B L O C K  letters. It's simple things like making a mix CD that make my  heart  smile.  I drove a lot today and yesterday. Remember how I said I talked a lot about driving the other day, with my parents? Well, I said something like, "I'm never allowed to ask to drive, and you never offer to let me drive, so I never get any practice!", so I guess my mom agreed, because she handed the keys to me many, MANY times today. She even let me start up the car and bring it around to the front of the building, while she went to the washroom! My brother sat in the backseat because he was afraid of sitting in the front. It was amusing. And I couldn't stop smiling. Because it was the first time I'd driven anyone ANYWHERE before (that is, without an adult in the car).  Sam, how about you and I go have some Teen Burgers on Wednesday before we meet with Chels for Lit study session? I have coupons that are going to expire soon and I don't want them to be discarded without having fulfilled their life's purpose.  2-for-1 TEEN BURGERS !!  Matt, I'm not angry about the cups being thrown. It just bugs me. Imagine how I feel. If you guys trash the place on a regular basis with slurpee cups, my caretaker will get mad and have to talk to me about it. Plus, are you guys coming to visit me or drop off garbage before church? That's just my take on it. I'm your friend, not your maid. I don't come to your house and throw slurpee cups around! (But then again, I've never been to your place. But when I come over this summer, I'm not going to be throwing slurpee cups around!) So I accept your apology and no biggie, but think about it first. Litter is BAD. Don't make me get all hippie on you! :D

      Steph, sorry that Dyllan threw our slurpee cups, we didn't think it was a big deal. But We are sorry.   So it was the girls choir drama thing tonight, and i was bored!! Other then the breath taking performances by Tom and Anne, I wanted to shoot myself. As Norman said, this thing is an hour and 30 minutes too long. It was funny. I was incedibly angry that i wasn't asked to be in it. I'm MAINSTAGE MATT! But I was quick to be thankful i wasn't in it. As my drama teachers have said, we are profesionals. The actors they had were like robots, with no character. I don't want to insult them, I mean, not many people have the courage to do that, and in such short amount of time, but it was far from good. Did it need to be good? No, but Mainstage has given me a bad character where I have to point out all the flaws of acting. I don't mean to be a jerk, but I'm blaiming mainstage. But yeah, Anne was funny, she was like soooo stuck up self absorbed girl. You could totaly buy that. Tom was funny at times, but you could tell he had memorized the lines and he was saying them by memory. He wasn't saying them naturally. But yeah, good times.

      As you may all know, McRoberts is not completely out of school (as most of you have nicely pointed out). I'm all good and prepared for math tomorrow (35 questions! All ROIGHT!) but Literature provincial is Thursday.  HELP!  Ippany-Steph and I must combine our superpower efforts to pass the Lit provincial! Hey, now that isn't such a bad idea...    IPPANYSPAM: The Industrial-Teen Revolution! Coming to comic book stores near you. Or near me. Hopefully near me so I don't have to bus.   Anyway, back on topic. Well, not the same topic. The Wicked Orange had quite the incredible band practice yesterday, and we started a new song (it's metal and it's either going to be about emo and fire, or killer robots [that invade the Whitehouse...ahaha! Jamie will kill me]). But anyway, I'm looking forward to my first time playing a show since last summer! It's gonna be awesome! Hey, might as well take the time to advertise.   The Wicked Orange! And 17 other awesome bands! Going all out, head to head, LAST BAND STANDING! Sunday! Sunday, SUNDAY, SUNDAY!! (funday?) June 27th at the Mesa Luna on West Broadway 5:00 pm - 12:30 am! Tickets are $10 online or from ME, or $15 at the door. Info and list of bands at  urlLink Supernova.com .      Whew. That was some hardcore advertising. Enjoy. I expect to see you all there.   By the way, I was looking at all of your  lovely  profiles when I found THIS on randomandrew's:  "You're going to the moon! What did you forget to pack?  stupid thing tells me i can only have 150 chars. how jewish. "    I'M  Jewish, nitwit. Does that mean I can only have 150 characters, as well, Mister Bond? Whatever  do   you mean, ANDREW? That's all I have to say.

        It's the time of the season  When the love runs high     Ok, I think we all know this song, but I'm not using it as a how it was originaly used. I'm using this song to talk about how Summer really brings the better sides of us out. How so? Well, my head is overloading with love for everyone I know, especialy the JC. Why? Because summer is making me go good crazy! How? Because there's no exams to worry about, no stress, no jerks to deal with at school. It's good times, and it makes me wanna hug all of you until your eyes pop out and shake my head to a rock song! The only bad thing, 1 person rule. But maybe Steph will be able to drive and we can have a convoy! YES! I can see it now. The JC presents it's wheels...  Speedy Reidy! Can go from 0 to 60 in 60 seconds and is older then all of us! Backup will be Car Killer, which by the way has an Awsome stereo system.  The Iponator! Just a work in proces, but we can't really name Steph's car until she has one. But a thought.  Oh man! let the good times roll! For example...  Tonight, I pick up Dyllan at his place. What you wanna do I ask? How much money you got he replies. Enough. Were going go karting. After an intense 10 minutes of hard core racing, we made our way to 7-11. On our journey Dyllan comes up with this Awsome plan. Lets go visit PJ! With our stomachs full, we went to his house with a surprise, and it turned out to be a night of watching   The Last Sumurai  . I probably spelt it wrong, but what an AWSOME movie. Dyllan and I cruised back home and here I am, inspired by the warm hot summer air to write this blog. Let's Rock With Love!    It's the time of the season for loving

       As we go on, we remember All the times we've had together And as our lives change from whatever We will still be friends forever...  Graduation - Vitamin C  In a way, I almost don't want Grade 11 to end. As much as I complain and talk about school being boring and such, I'm really scared for next year. I'm even scared for this summer. This'll be the last summer where I know that in September, I'll still be here. With my friends and everything that's been familiar to me for the last seven years. Come summer 2005, I'll be packing. Possibly moving to another province. I'm excited for this new chapter in life, but it scares the DAYLIGHTS out of me. New school, new people, new surroundings, new home (possibly). I'll be 18. I'll be legal. I gotta do my own LAUNDRY. (Not that I don't right now, but it's nice to have Mom help out a lot.)  There's so many people that I love and that I could never leave behind and yet, I will have to do just that when I go off to school next year. I can't explain this sense of mixed dread and anticipation that lies within my heart. It's frightening. Sometimes, I'll sit in my room, listen to music (specifically songs like The Verve's  Bittersweet Symphony  or David Usher's cover of  Fast Car ), and I cry. Not because I'm sad, but because I'm so excited and so scared at the same time. I know God has a plan for me and that things will work out in the end, but not knowing what that plan is makes me feel so blind. I understand that whatever lies in my future may take a lot of strength to complete, but... oh, my heart is so heavy with thoughts.  I'm excited for the all-nighter. It's things like these that create memories for me. Years from now, I'll still remember Matt's love of locomotives. Anne's uncanny ability to make people happy. Andrew's constant battles of logic. Ben's unwavering love of music and Jesus. Sam's strength and determination. Dyllan. (Just Dyllan because everything about him is fantastic.) Lauren and our hilariously aimless car rides to Tim Horton's and back. I love everyone one of you and I thank you for the impression you have left on my heart.

      I'm waiting for my CD to finish burning in the afternoon, and this may take a while. What do I do? Watch TV? Nah, nothing good on day time TV. Video games? No, not enough time to really get intoo it. But then an Idea comes to mind!! My trains! I hadn't played with them for almost two months! I had lost respect for my beloved trains! So, I sat down, and reconnected with my hobby. I even took my annual train notes  On CPR mainline, A CP Rail freight has just left the Port Coquitlam yards. It's a small mixed freight consisting of 34 cars. It's lead units are CPR SD40-2 5415 and 6027.   On CNR mainline, A small transfer freight has just left the New Westminster Yards heading towards CN's main yard, where hey will transfer the freight to a bigger one, which is heading to Kamloops. This train, also a mixed freigh, consists of 18 cars and the lead units are GP40 9306 and GP39 4103.  Wow, i still got it. Yeah, just like the good old days. Funny how Fred used to do this with me, now he gets payed to do this on the real thing. How amazing how dreams can become reality. My brother is living proof.   Ahhh trains, you gotta love them. Why not? Did they do anything to you? That's right, they didn't, there your friend...  And you gotta love your friends...

      Matt's a real dork who thinks I don't post anymore. WE'LL SHOW HIM.  I had my Socials exam today. It was alright, but kinda shaky. I got all the stuff in the politics and geography sections, but the WW1 and WW2 sections pretty much kicked my ass. Oh well. I think I've done well enough in class during the year, that I won't completely bomb my final Socials mark. I have French and Biology tomorrow, which'll be a hoot and a half.  When my mom drove me to school this afternoon for my Socials exam, I passed the Westminster and Garden City intersection and I saw Dyllan and a bunch of other kids walking to the church. Made me wish all my exams were done. Like now. Boooo.  I kinda feel like swimming, but I can't 'cause I gotta study more after this post. And I found two t-shirts in my closet the other day. I wore them when I was a little kid, but hey, they still fit, so I wore one of them today and I felt so rad.

      Well, no exams today, but get this! I got 75% on my english final!!! That's a B!! And another reason why i love english more then French.  So here I am, and it seems nobody realy posts anything anymore. Steph was going strong and then she died out. Just about the time I started puting lengthly posts on, such as this one. Sam hasn't posted anything ever since she joined, Andrew just leaves comments, and so on and so on. Really, i don't care, but it does get boring if i have to comment on my own stuff. Anywho...  So today I woke up at 1 in the afternoon, not good since I have a physics exam tomorrow, and i was planning on finishing my overdue CAPP projects that were due in like March or something. My counselor kinda hinted i wasn't going to graduate if i didn't hand that in soon.   Wow, summer is already upon us. Dyllan and them all at Palmer are already out of school, i mean, what's up with that? Stupid Richmond having to finish first. Well, I'm only a couple days behind, unlike poor McRoberts (who i feel very sorry for).   Work starts next week, and I really don't think much will change from this week. I only have a little bit of time before I have to go to work so summer for me might not even start until the All Nighter, which i still haven't beenable to book off yet. But yeah! Swimming on the 24th, thats gonna be fun. Anywho, duty calls...I'm probably gonna fail physics, why do i bother...

      I just finished the last Math class of my LIFE. I just finished the last Chem class of my LIFE. Man, that feels good.  Matt came to visit McRoberts today (as you already know). That was the only cool part of my day, besides falling on the floor and Anne helping me up. That was hard because we were laughing too much. Oh well.

      Well, today i learned many things, like how i hate stupid questions on Socials exams, but the one thing that really stuck out was the fear of McRoberts. Why? I dunno, It was like oh man, I'm an outsider! No one likes me!   Indeed that wasn't true, i mean, they don't even know me and i was there to see my friends, but whatever, a Robson thing i guess. It was really fun actually! I saw sooooo many new things! I saw all my friends and went into a diferent high school for my first time ever!!! Wow, that really was fun...The best part was going to Bio. Oh yes, you gotta love Bio, even though i've never taken it. I must say, Magee is still more cooler, not to start a controversy, but it's just so new and it's in da creme du la creme area! Anywho, if I wasn't so tired I probably would have had a much better time. My 2 disapointments, being extremly tired,and not seeing Brendan!!! Where was he!!!?!??!?!?!?! oh man, that was a disapointment indeed.  Ahhh McRoberts, what a nice school. You gotta love it, except for that freaky french vibe! And they fact there were video cameras...Ah yes, freaky video cameras and weird french vibes makes McRoberts my personal favourite school! No wounder, t's got some of my best and closests friends that I've ever had. Ahhhhhhh, that's what makes it so good...

      Alright! Socials didn't go too bad. I bombed one part, probably got like 2 outa 10, but otherwise, I'm ok, i hope...  Anywho, i was suposed to go visit the crew at McRoberts but because of studying and other things, cumincations got mixed up so here I am at home. If only I had my car...  Yay! Anne is in, now, we need to get Dyllan...yes Dyllan...So my damn Drama teachers weren't there so i didn't get my Bye Bye Birdie video. What robbery...Technology does suck too!!! Whatever, 2 more exams!!!! And what's up with da price of batteries??? Geez Loiuzze. Oh wait, I can't say that now that Anne's in, umm Geez Cheez. The is messed up...

So yeah, did my english final today, saw no major problems, probably not perfect but i see no need to fail...good times. I'm gonna go for lunch soon, and just to let you know Steph, i haven't eaten much yet and my stomach has recovered. Man, i must have gained 20 pounds over this weekend.   I'm getting my Bye Bye Birdie Video Tomorrow!!!! We HAVE to watch it!! Hey! Maybe at the all nighter!! Wow...the posibilities are endless. HAHAHA!! Man, Rick Mercer kills me...

      Yesterday night I could not attend youth group, due to the fact that my church was having a surprise party for my dad. On account of it being the 25th anniversary of his ordination as a minister. He was so fooled, lol, it was great. It was so amazing to see how many people really love my dad. I guess I take for granted how amazing he is, so much appreciation. I'm so glad it happened, my dad really has been needing some encouragement lately. But it just really reminded me how cool my dad is, and how much I love him.

      I'm really angry right now. Partly because of a deal I had working with a friend. He's paying me to print off 500 copies of his band's CD, because I have a connection with a CD printing press. I called his house to update him and he wasn't home, but his mom wanted to speak with me, so she did. She made me feel like total crap. I hate that. When adults talk down to you. But whatever. I'm over it, sort've. I'll get the job done, he'll pay me and he'll get the CDs and I doubt I'll ever be working with them again. It's unfortunate because I really enjoy their music. But I don't need someone's mom telling me about the job I'm doing.  Bowling was fun tonight, don't you guys agree? Only, I was majorly disappointed with the lack of disco going on. And the fact that I got two strikes in a row at the END OF A GAME. They should've happened earlier on. Bummer. However, my spirits were uplifted during the sing and shout par-tay on the bus back to the church. Another thing that annoyed me though, is the new guys that were at the youth group. I'm all down for welcoming new people in the group and making new friends, but I thought it was so rude that they were abusing everything. Languages, attitudes, the church building... I'm trying not to make a big deal, but it bugs/hurts me so much to see someone yell something like, "Praise the Lord!" knowing that they don't care anything for the three words they just said. It really, really hurts.  I think I'm mistreating this website. I'm ranting too much. I'm sorry, continue.

      What the hec?!?!? Ten Bucks!!! To Go Bowling!????!!? Usualy i wouldn't be so mad, but a month ago, i asked if we could get the youth to come watch my play. I was told that 8 dollars was too much money to come see me. Were paying $10 to go bowling!!!!! That's $2 more to go bowling!!! What the hell? Seriuosly!!!! I mean, sure, 8 bucks is a rip off to go see a play, but I was in it!!! None of my friends from youth or Richmond came to see me!!! I felt really bad!! And the youth could have gone to see me but $8 was too much money!!! Whats more important? Suport from friends? or Bowling in the 70's? What ever happened to good old Lowis Lanes for 5 bucks or something? (That's right, Steph knows)But really, what a way to put me down. 8 bucks is too much to see me, but it's ok to pay $10 to go bowling. Wheres The Love...Where Is The Love....

      I had a cookie during the 15 minute break just now. And I had three cookies last night. That's four cookies within 24 hours! Intense...  Am I the only one who think it's a bummer that bowling this Friday costs $10? Did it use to be $4.75 or something? But then again, that was Lois Lanes. And apparently, we're going to the Zone this time. So I guess it'll work out eventually. Also noted in the Youth update/e-mail, there is, IN FACT, an all-nighter being planned for the 25th. My last exam is the day before. So I will have lots to celebrate. Who votes we play Cops & Robbers in the dark again, like last time? Dude, that was so rad.  My throat hurts. I really hope it's not sickness coming to steal me away right before exams. Let's hope I don't fall ill. That would suck a lot.

      I got a "service medallion" at the Awards Ceremony tonight. I tied for it with Krystyna Adams. Let's analyze this a bit: you've got your All-Canadian, straight-A, sports-lovin', ultimate robo-student and on then, on the flip side, you've got your slacker extradonaire. SERIOUSLY.   What's up with that?   P.S. Matt made me Admin (nah-nah) and so I changed the layout. This is just easier to read. I think. If you hate this, tell me.

      Guys, seriously, are you being serious?  It's ok to be semi-serious, but all of what you do must pertain to some level of seriousness. Seriously, if you don't get seriously serious, I will seriously kick the serious into your unserious asses!  But on a totally unserious note, I have this totally paradoxialseriosity blogsite called  urlLink  ranDOMinion . If you're clever, you'll find a seriously PHun gimick in the name. Go to  urlLink  ranDOMinion , leave comments, make fun of things or serious people, then come back and do it again (when there new posts, seriously sillies!).  I just wanted to seriously show Matt how dubiously unserious the matter of adding people to the blogger is. I will come back and write here at serious random intervals, as I am quite random at best when it comes to serious matters.   Peace! <>  BTW: Sunday night at youth...I have a suprise for some people! Some people could be anyone, because there is no one in particular that is picked ahead, IT COULD BE YOU!  BTW2: Have serious PHun by using html code in your blog post! Simply use the tags, and none of the "overall" codes (ie: html, head, etc). See, how I hyperlinked the url to my blogsite? Moy phun-o!

      School, my worst enemy, yet my best friend, how i loathe it.  If only school was like church, and people prayed for each other afterwards. People fall asleep during sermons, and english class. Jesus is at school too, but it's not always as evident, gotta look a little harder.   But luckily there is only 8 full days of classes remaining. That my friends is stinkin exciting. Hope everybody has things to do this summer. But if you don't, fear not, for something is bound to happen, and if it doesn't, then make something happen!!!

      So it finaly ends. That was an Awsome playoffs! Besides Vancouver's early exit, but they were sucking so they didn't desrve to go on. Poor flames though. You can't even imagine how hard that must have been for them...watching another team so happy, celebrating, and your going home empty handed. That must really hurt, like nothing ever before. CBC put on there annual playoff music video again and it was sooooooooooooo good! It was 100 Years by Five For Fighting and it was really good. Really brought out the emotions in hockey. I'm gonna have to show you guys...hockey fan or not, it was great!   The Great Thing About Sport Is That Theres A Winner.

      I'm having a very strange day. I didn't get enough sleep and the sleep that I did get was riddled with interruptions. But I came to school anyway. Yes, I am dressed cheerily in a yellow polo shirt, jeans, and flip flops, but my demeanor is no different from a day where I would otherwise be dressed in sweatpants and a grey hoodie.  However, my day is slightly brightened, knowing that tonight, I should be receiving Coalition's 500 EP order back from the duplication house. Which is fabulous, because I hate waiting. My mood is also relieved because I uploaded a new playlist onto my mp3 player last night (which I did get new  batteries for) and now, I can walk with a bounce in my step, while Jimmy Eat World and  The Middle  play in the background.  Dear Fellow Bloggers, I propose we all go swimming on the 24th, after Sam and I complete our final exam: Literature 12. Spread the word. Sincerely, Stephanie Ip

      Why do we have exams? We have learned all the stuff, been tested on all of the stuff, and no it aaalllllllllllllllllllllllllll comes back to give us the most stress we have ever had in our teenage life!! Why??? No one ever will know, but as long as they keep coming, let's not freak out. I'm not as worried as before, but yes I'm freaking out! I mean, it is a test, we've done them all before. Now we just have more then usual and longer then usual. The point I'm trying to make is don't go on a panic attack. There's more stuff then usual, but after like a couple days, your partying hard! So show those exams whose boss! And Jesus is always there too! Remember... Love that's STRONGER, Love that COVERS SIN, and TAKES the WEIGHT of the WORLD . Yeah, the weight of the world, are the exams. Jesus will take that weight so don't worry! Be Happy! ok, that was Bob Marly

Quite spectacular, I must say. Anyway, This is Stephanie Ip (who else?) and this blog is radtastical.  I have studied nothing all weekend, and considering exams are in a week and a half, I'm pretty much... screwed. Never fear. Steph works best under extreme pressure!  Apparently, there's going to be a guest appearance by the former bassist of the RPCYouth worship band... one by the name of... Alan MacGregor? But that's just the word on the street. Don't hold me to it.

I HATE It! It bugs me sooooo much! Is it because I lose confidence? Is it because I get tired? How will i ever make it to the next level when I'm going backwards! ARGH!

      Sam here, and let me tell you what happened today! Well, today is, for me, the 12th annual Whiteside Spring Fair (only because I've been to it every year since kindergarten), so this is the 12th time I've been. I brought my brother considering he goes there, and it was great. My grade seven teacher says to me (in french, of course): "Oh Samantha, nice hair colour! It seems to change every time I see you." Pfft...figures...I come back to Whiteside all the time, and I dye my hair at least once a month or so. I expect I'll be seeing bald patches soon.  So other than that, I've had an overall great week. Lots of acting--our one acts were Wednesday and there's another showing tomorrow night...McRoberts...7 pm...entrance by donation...be there or be circular. CIRCULAR, MAN!  Anyway, Matt is cool. And in the words of the famous Martha Stewart: Rock the Casbah. Wait, that wasn't Martha Stewart, was it? Heh. Good old Martha Stewart...

      Being grounded really sucks. I don't really see how it's supposed to motivate me to do better in school. I can see how it works out as punishment, but my mom says she wants me to take this time to re-evaluate my goals in life and to clean my up act. Uh... whose goals? Your goals or my goals? For goodness' sake. My dad says I'm grounded 'till the Hawaii trip. My mom says I'm grounded for a week. For the first time in my life, I actually want to side with my mom. But then my dad's catch is, I'm grounded 'till Hawaii OR until I learn how to play  Stairway To Heaven  by Led Zeppelin&nbsp;on guitar. Uh... right. I hope I don't butcher this thing.  Anyway, I'm actually really excited for this High Society thing. I got my skirt, I got my "accessories", I got my shirt and shoes. Flip flops, really, but hey, I match and that's what matters.&nbsp;That's not completely true. But that's okay. BAHA! I'm such a kick.  &nbsp;

       It's good to be back. I missed everyone so much while I was at camp. I kept seeing Anne and Matt there because there was a girl who looked like Anne and guys who kept sounding like Matt or walking like Matt. Plus, they had a Canada Day on the Wednesday, and Matt, you would've loved it.    &nbsp;  Camp was absolutely amazing. I've never spent such a fantastic week with God. Every service spoke to me and worship always ended in tears. I thank God every morning for the life he's given to me and the people he's blessed me with. Even though life will get difficult and you'll get hurt sometimes, it's okay because God will help you work things out. God loves me and it's still hard for me to grasp that. But I know he's there waiting for the day where I will fully comprehend that fact.    &nbsp;  Isn't it beautiful?

      Well, crazy week is more then half over, and it definitly is getting better. The weird fealing though that this is a weird week is still there. Anywho, I gotta tell you about day 4...  Day 4 has had to been my best day, by FAR! I organized my songs and burned some CD's and that was kind of fun. Then I went out to Hon's with Julian for dinner! We had a chat about my grade 12 year because apperently he and some other people were woried about my education. I talked to him and explained what courses I was takling and we both had a great time! It's good to know that people really do care for me too! Then it was off to PJ's with Anne, and it was soooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun! We played this Awesome game and Anne and I kept on blocking his one place and, well, you had to have been there. It was great though! Really was!  Day 5 was a noon game at the stadium. So it was fine, I was top hawker. Then it was chill time with Nelly and Joyce at White Spot! That was fun! Although the food was a little disapointing, but thats ok. I then brought Nelly to my place where we got some hockey sticks and ran into Sarah! That was fun too! Then we taught Nelly how to play hockey, then some 1 on 1, Garry and me. I lost 4-2 but it was pretty intense. Then we did some more random things and now I sit at home! I can't wait for this week to end though, it's just sooo weird.

      This day was just weird, I hate this day!! I had a horrable sleep and I couldn't go to work, I had no energy. This day was a day where I organized my music too. I downloaded songs I wanted and deleted songs I don't need.&nbsp; I found out Andrew was moving away which was sad. Andrew is such a cool guy.  &nbsp; I wish you luck Andrew &nbsp; I then went and got my haircut, had lunch with my grandma, and watched MXC!! I love that show. It was then off to work, which was ok.&nbsp; I only made $1 in tips! Whats up with that? I then got a call from Dyllan, and all the toughts I got out of my head have come back. Sounded like he was having so much fun! I want to be there! But what you gonna do...

Truth is, I will be coming back for every youth event. So you guys are sorta bringin' me back.   Just a short note, really. I must get going, laundry and packing to do. See you all soon! :)

      Day 2 came today, and I didn't feel as bad. There were times I was like "I Wounder What There Doing Now?" &nbsp; I went to work with Dave, and talk about hard core work!! Holy crap!! I was worked! It was kind of like working on my train set, but way more effort. As originaly though, time crawled and I couldn't wait until I was done! Now it's back to work at the Stadium. It wasn't too bad. I was still so tired from work with Dave though.&nbsp; Anywho, today was really a Monday, it really didn't feel like Sunday! Oh Yeah, I'm not traumatized Nelly!!! I just can't believe I'm missing out on this "life changing week". Anywho... &nbsp; Day 2: Complete Status: Hard!! Physicaly demanding!!

      Starting on this Saturday, and ending next Saturday, I have deemed Crazy Week. I don't know what this week has in store for me, and It's freakin me out! So I've decided to write about each and every day so I can figure out why it's so crazy.  &nbsp; This morning was hard, it really was. I said good bye to my best friends, and I wouldn't see them for a week. There was something bugging me too. Yes, I wasn't going to see my friends for a while, but I soon realized that it was because I wasn't going. I wasn't going to camp. I wasn't going to camp. I actualy wasn't going to camp. Any major even in the youth group i usualy come, but I wasn't going to camp. It was so hard to just deal with the fact, especialy when everyone was excited. All today I was going "I waunder what there doing now?" I really wished I went to camp, but then again, I really like having Speedy Reidy. You can't have them all, but I wish i could. Then the weirdest most weirdest thing of all was coming back to the church with Bill. It was an empty bus, no youth. It was fun, but no youth. Wow. &nbsp; I played hockey today and it wasn't the greatest. I had a poor record (1-2-0) but it was nice to do something to get my mind of camp. I got hit in the shoulder so that kind of hurt. Then a guy took a shot at me with his stick in the arm. When I get home, theres a message saying hey Matt, you got to be at work at 5 instead of 6. No biggie for me. As I'm about to go, Dave Philips calls me and asks if I want to go to work with him tomorrow. Yes! I signed myself up so I'm going to work tomorrow at 8:30 in the morning! When I get home, i go back to work!! Haha! Oh man, crazy week. &nbsp; Work was ok. I was&nbsp; really tired so I slacked. I made $265 in sales so that was nice! I got home earlier then expected and now bed is in my mind.  &nbsp; Day 1: Complete. Status: Hard, the emotions really got to me.

      Serving Christ is no laughing, easy, good times matter. In fact, everyday can be a struggle.   Jesus said to a very rich man "Sell all your belongings and give everything you own to the poor, then you can follow me". The cost of following Jesus to this man was very great. But it is great to everyone, you have to CHOOSE Jesus in everything you do.   What I mean is that you shouldn't feel too discouraged. Find strength in the Lord and remember that He has a great plan. Just remember to put Him first in everything.   To go to Bible college, I sacrificed having a car, my friendships here at home, life living that was normal. Insuring a car is very expensive. Going to Bible college is also very expensive. There is financial aid for one of the two...  Do you remember Annick's words? Embrace them; they were not from her, but from God.

      After a crappy morning I decided to call my dad and tell him about me getting car insurance. Turns out that the price he gave me was for the smallest amount possible. That means I can't go to school, work, or anything. And my step mom was already a $%$#@% this morning! This is honestly too much for me now. I have lost all confidence in everything I do. I can't get  job, I can't afford to insure Speedy Reidy, I can't do barely anything. Why does this hapen now? Why during the time where you should be happy? I hate this a lot. It's so hard to go anywhere with a smile now and just put everything behind. I've already hanled so much crap, i don't want to go through anymore.

      Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday were the four raddest days all summer. AND ALL IN A ROW, TOO! Talk about a winning streak.  Yesterday was awesome 'cause Nick, Matt M, Dyllan and I went downtown for the Switchfoot concert. It was REALLY good. Totally amazing. Switchfoot ended the set without playing  Dare You To Move  and I was so upset because that's my favourite song by them and I couldn't believe they didn't play it. But then everyone started chanting for an encore, so of course, they come back on stage and THEY PLAYED  DARE YOU TO MOVE . How wonderful! It inspired me to actually learn something on an instrument so that Matt, Nick, Kevin and I could actually play something at our next "jam session". Radtastic.  And this morning, I met Alex, Andy's little brother and he is SO COOL! I tried to convince Mrs. Gabruch not to leave until after Wednesday so Alex could join us at Youth. Everyone, if you meet Mrs. Gabruch, tell her not to leave till Thursday! And Alex really is really cool. :)  Anyway, I went to the library today and got a bunch of movies, so I think I'll watch those now.

      After seven seasons with the San Jose Sharks, Mike Ricci will be leaving the Sharks for the phoenix Coyotes. Mark Recchi will be going back to his original team, Pittsburgh, and after a lot of thought, and lots of input, Goalie Matthew Robson has decided that he will not be joining RPC Youth in the Nanoose Bay Teen Camp.   There are many superlatives that you can use to describe Mike Ricci, but the most widely held is that of competitor," general manager Michael Barnett said. "He lays it on the line, every shift, every night." He said he looks forward to joining his new club. "The Coyotes have a great nucleus of young, talented players," Ricci said.  Recchi's agent, Rick Curran, wouldn't provide details on the contract, but said the right wing is "absolutely delighted" to be in Pittsburgh, where he has kept a home for several years.  After everything seemed to be a go, Matthew Robson has pulled out of Nanoose Bay teen camp. "It's a tough decision for me" Robson said. "I really wanted to go, but there were just certain details I had to work out." Robson is expected to be working during the week he was going to be at camp and with the extra cash he has decided to insure his car.

      Camp now has turned into a large debate with myself. After getting my first pay cheque, I realized how close I was to getting car insurance, and how close I could come to getting both car insurance and an editing system! However, to be able to purchase these 2 products, I would have to give up my camp money and not go to Nanoose Bay Teen Camp. It all comes down to priorities now.   First priority, an editing system. For many, many, many, many, many years, I have   NEEDED   and editing system. Once I get one, I can start to edit my train movies and start to sell them! Yay!!! This has been something I've needed for a long time.   Second priority, car insurance. I've needed money for car insurance ever since I received my 'N' in February. Now that Speedy Reidy has official become vacant, it could be all mine! Once again, I've never had the money for this, so finally getting the chance to get car insurance is exciting.   Don't get me wrong, Camp seems Awesome!!! I mean really Awesome!!! But it all comes down to my priorities. The thought of camp came into my head in late June, not many years ago, or in February. Plus, when I'm at camp, I'm missing six days of work, which adds up to about $200 bucks! The only thing that keeps me from not staying behind is the disappointment I leave with friends. I really don't know what to do... I'm praying to see what I should do, but honestly, the possibilities of me staying home the week of the 17th to the 24th are very likely.

      Well, today is the day I finally drop of my resume to Canadian Tire. I'm really hoping that I get this job, like really hoping. I'm up so early for me!! Oh well, got a noon game today. Hope I do well.  Notice how my life is full of hope? I find that cool!  So after I got home from work I went to my room and worked on some trains before I went to bed. I really wanted to enjoy some awesome worship at youth, but I was at work, so it wasn't happening. So everyone was in bed and the lights turned off, I decided to listen to my Hillsong CD. It was like worship, my headphones blocked any other noise and you could hear the crowd in the background. It was actually awesome! I worshiped Jesus by myself in my room with just a CD. I really enjoyed it and it made me reflect on past good times.  Anywho, some closing comments. Yes Marey Kate is addicted to cocaine and she's in some rehab centre. And now with this post, I believe that 50% of the last 10 posts have been mine. UH OH STEPHANIE! hahaha! Good times, I wonder why are other members don't post?

      So what the hec is up with this stupid sky train? Not only is it a poser train, it lies!!   ATTENTION EVERYONE!!   Don't listen to the sky train! It's evil!!! It's a train in the sky!!!! That's wrong!!! So anywho, the reason why I hate this is because I got confused and didn't get of at the right station. Well...I did, but I wanted to get off at a different station, it's a complicated story.  So I was in Burnaby today, cutting the grass at my dad's work area and I decided to think. First thing that popped into my head is how different I am from my family! It's so true!!! I mean, look at it, my entire family needs glasses! I, on the other hand, don't. I'm really artistic when it comes to things. For example, our model train set. My new train set I'm working on I'm more dedicated to detail. Same with photography and filming, I love to get the art side of things.   Second thing I thought of was envy...  The movie   Envy   is about two good friends.   Ben Stiller  , who plays one of the friends, is a hard working guy dedicated to his work. The other friend,   Jack Black   plays some easy going slacker. All of the sudden, he thinks of this wack idea and Stiller decides not to join in and Black become rich. This scenario is almost like my life. I know I shouldn't be envy or anything, and I'm really not, but I am. Why? Dyllan has this great job and now he's going to get a great car. I can't get a decent job and I have no money for a car! I know I know it's stupid, but it does make me a little jealous. But I'm happy for the guy. I'm trying to put it behind me and just ignore it, but I saw poor Speedy Reidy just sitting there. Made me wish I had money.  Third thing I thought about was camp. Can I really afford to take a week of from life? In times like these where I need money for car insurance? When I need to find a good paying job? When I need to start saving for post secondary? Can I afford it? Literally, can I afford that much money? The answer is no! I can't afford to take a week of from life! I can't afford the $290 dollars! I haven't realized but the real world is coming soon, and I'm not going to be prepared to face it. It's hard to believe that I have so much going on inside that my friends don't even know, and that I don't even know. Luckily, I have Jesus on my side. He's cheering me on from the sidelines. Couldn't ask for a better fan. So what to do? Skip camp? Maybe, I'll pray. If God wants me to go, then I'll go.  On my trip home, I think I was given a sign. My dad gave me a company cheque for cutting the grass. I'm expecting a small number such as $20. I look at it, and I see a cheque for $100!! Just my luck too! I need $133 more to go to camp! So who knows! Maybe I should go to camp!   Oh yeah! I hate East Side Vancouver!!! To Big and confusing! Oh yeah, Steph. In the last 10 posts, I've posted the most! Who posts more now!?! I think I'm addicted to Subway cookies too! Just like Marey Kate and cocaine

      I feel like I'm the only one left here who posts on a regular basis anymore. That's okay. Once I post this, someone'll come and post something just to proove me wrong. Like how I did when Matt posted about this very topic.  Yesterday was amusing. Anne, Dyllan, Matt, my bro and I went swimming and it was so fun! Matt and I started a competition/game where someone threw a quarter and then we had to race to get it back from the bottom of the deep, dark, dangerous pool. It was rad until I scraped my elbow on the bottom of the pool. Actually, I think that wasn't from the game, but that's okay. Then we sat in the sauna for a long time and it was gross. Dyllan's gross. And then we got locked in for awhile. But that's okay 'cause we were broiling. :)  And yeah, Andrew, what's going on this Wednesday? I'm too lazy to e-mail you, so I'm hoping you check this regularly.   Steph's Official Countdowns:   1 DAY 'TILL SUPERFUN  SLEEPOVER  2 DAYS 'TILL THE  FINDING EMO  TOUR KICK-OFF 4 DAYS 'TILL SWITCHFOOT AT THE COMMODORE BALLROOM 7 DAYS 'TILL WARPED TOUR 2004 AT TBIRD STADIUM 11 DAYS 'TILL NANOOSE BAY TEEN CAMP

      I just made cookies today. That got me really excited. They're pretty good too.  I've done nothing all day 'cept make stencils, actually paint a stencil, make more stencils, bake cookies, talk on the phone, and yeah... that was by far, my least interesting day since school let out. And it's a bit grey/rainy, so I assume Ultimate Frisbee is out for tonight. Which gets me wondering... what ARE we doing for Youth tonight? But that's all part of the mystery and excitement.  I got Spongebob Squarepants pyjamas and just thought everyone should know.  I also found out that Dashboard Confessional will be visiting Vancouver in October (was it October), but unfortunately, will be playing a 19+ venue, which is a bit unsettling. I always thought Dashboard was for the kids. The kids who are stuck in a world of continuous heart break and rejection. Not a world of urban, trendy working young adults who drink on the weekends to forget their busy work lives. Oh well. I tried.  I am disgruntled. The jeans I was hoping to wear for tomorrow are not in the wash, but alas, still in the hamper. That's okay. I think I'll do some laundry tonight. It's sad to think that the only time I ever do laundry is when I need something to wear. It's not so bad though.

      Wednesday my step mom left to go to Galiano early, just be herself, leaving my dad and me. While eating diner at my granny's, my dad calls and says "You want to go train exploring?". Whoa, a question I haven't been asked for so long. Why? Well, maybe due to the absence of Fred, me spending more time with my friends, or because of my Step mom. As I recall, the last time I went train exploring it was with my step mom. It really sucked. You can Never NEVER bring someone who isn't as into trains as you. The time before was almost a year ago, without Charlene. Once again, she was not in the city. It was time to take advantage of the situation.  "Sure! Lets do it!" I said and we went into Richmond to explore tracks I always wanted to explore. It was my favorite childhood trains other line that we went on, and all these times I've never really seen these tracks from the rails point of view. We started on No 2 road, out by the bridge over to Steveston, and I had Susan (my camera)with me ready to take interesting shots of the old line. It was really really weird. I never knew any of these things were hear. But what broke my heart was how businesses have treated the railroad. We found 12 customers the railroad serviced, or used to. Out of those 12, only one received railroad cars. ONE! 1!!! It was so surprising to see that. It's so interesting how people really dislike the business of the railroad. Broke my heart.  On a closing note, as we made are way back to the car, and came close to the end of the line, I saw a 'W' sign. This sign obviously stands for Whistle. But there was no need to whistle, there was no road it was crossing. Ahhhh, but many years ago, the railway did cross the road, and went into Steveston. MANY years ago. And now all that stands in remembrance of the history of the old line to Steveston is a whistle sign. How sad. We Don't Want You Anymore trains, and once your gone, no one will remember you. That's probably true, and sad for a railroader like me...

      Let me ask you all a question. If your friend was doing something very important, would you be there to witness it? If your friend was in a championship hockey game, or any game, would you watch it? If your friend was about to put on the biggest show of their life, would you be their to cheer them on?  For me, the answer is yes, and I have proved my word. A couple of springs ago, I went to watch one of Matt and Nick's hockey games. They continuously invited me and I decided, yea, there my friends, lets go out and support them. Just a couple months back I went to go watch Stephanie's one act with Dyllan, which I think really made her feel great.  I bring this up because before I went to bed I found an old  Bye Bye Birdie  poster, my first ever major musical I was ever in, a professional student show. The thing that bugged me the most that not one friend from church came to see me. Not one. Pastor Andy came to see me, and it was still only his first week as being a youth pastor. Pastor Jade came to see me, and he barely sees me. But it made my day when I saw them, with Amrit and Sarah too. But I just wished that at least one friend could have come. There was not even proof of an effort from many (except for Steph, who wasn't allowed to go). But still, I was telling everyone months before, and there were six shows! It still bugs me... Could they not sacrifice one night and $7 for a friend? My two hockey buddy hates musicals, yet they came. And not once has anyone, besides me, watched my movie. I have attempted to, but no one wants to watch me for free now, let alone the $7.  I may be sounding selfish, but there really was no possible excuse for missing it. The excuses that would work if you were out of town, not allowed to go, or sick or something. Stephanie qualifies for that. But people like Dyllan, Matt, and Nick just didn't want to go. Coming from an actor, and a goalie, it really makes your day when a friend comes to give you a hug or high five after the show. Yet all I got was a high five from people I barely knew, or hockey buddies. I definitely would have preferred friends but when the tables turn, they just can't take the bullet for me.

      As many people at the Tsawwassen ferry terminal waundered why the Queen of Naniamo was late, nothing could be for sure. Was it because the cafeteria ran out of letuce? Was it because the captain had to go to the washroom for an extra long time? As I said, nothing could be for sure. The only thing the was for sure was that Matthew Robson and Dyllan Morgan were back on the mainland after a intense four day vacation.  Yes, I am back, and it is nice to sleep on a bed, since we didn't have foamies for our tent. Nevertheless, it was fun. We did mny things and I really did enjoy myself. Dyllan wanted to go back, but I was happy to be home!  Anywho, problems are already boiling up just as I  get home, GREAT! Ok, Thursday something happened to my alarm. I don't know what, but bottom line, it didn't go off. I rushed my way to work but I was still 20 minutes late, which made my boss very unhappy. aI had no excuse, I didn't want to put the blame on an alarm clock, so we continued on the day. I then finished up and I was payed. Things seemed to be ok, right? WRONG! His wife, who is my step moms sister was talikng to her and aperintly he was still mad, and the "way he said it" I was late every single day. What? I was late Thursday! I didn't mean to! Why would I want to be late. So I got in trouble, had a talking to, and was relieved that I didn't have to work tomorrow. I was dead tired and I figured I could use a long sleep in. I clearly remember him saying "I'll Call You If I Need You In Monday". It was Sunday night, 10pm, sweet! I don't have to work! A day off would be nice. I wake up this morning, theres a message. He wants me to come in! I would have to have been there at 9 and he calls me at 8:10. Thats a little unfair wouldn't you say? But he sounded doughtful that I would come in and he said if your going to come, then come. Since I needed this day off, I decided I won't come in, and if he's mad, so be it, you don't call someone the morning you want them to come in and expect them to be there. I'll have an excuse this time.  Isn't it great to be back home?

      Anyone know what's up with this Friday night? I kind of doubt that we'll be going to  THE  Splashdown since it's listed as 7 PM and you'd usually go earlier in the day for a trip like that... right? Anyway, get back to me on that one.  I like sitting in parking lots with friends, blasting music at a reasonable level. Then, you turn around and pick up an imitation Oreo off the ground of the car and throw it into the next car where the occupants are surely swapping spit. It's amusing to make fun of them. But of course, we all know people who make fun of PDA'ers are just lonely. Yes, I am lonely. Actually, not really. I have friends to keep me amused. Which makes me wonder. What's up with teenage relationships? Why so much effort? I mean, there's a huge number of married couples who can't make things work, why should teenagers start jumping the bandwagon? This is one of the reasons why I have yet to have a boyfriend. It doesn't bug me though. Enjoy being young. It doesn't last too long. (This isn't to say I wouldn't mind a special someone. I'm just lazy...ish.)  Forget everything you just read. It's late and I don't make sense. Oh yah, LAUREN COMES BACK FROM EUROPE TOMORROW!! Someone enlighten me. Is there a way to write letters to Ben Appenheimer while he is at camp? Or e-mail? Or something?!
