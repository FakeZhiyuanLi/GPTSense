"I'm here without you baby ... but your still on my lonely mind"    I'm going to leave everyone with this song .. it gets me through the day and hopefully it will help you with yours ...

       ? I wonder where your heart is 'Cause it sure don't feel like it's here Sometimes I think you wish That I would just disappear Have I got it all wrong Have you felt this way long Are you already gone  Do you feel lonely When you're here by my side Does the sound of freedom Echo in your mind Do you wish you were by yourself Or that I was someone else Anyone else  Where would you be If you weren't here with me Where would you go If you were single and free Who would you love Would it be me Where would you be  I don't wanna hold you back No I don't wanna slow you down I don't wanna make you feel Like you are tied up and bound 'Cause that's not what love's about If there's no chance we can work it out Tell me now Oh, tell me tell me now  Have I become the enemy Is it hard to be yourself In my company ?   This used to be dedicated ... but i guess i kno where you would be eh?   o lord im retarded .. lol martina is just so depressin lol

       There's a boat, I could sail away There's the sky, I could catch a plane There's a train, there's the tracks I could leave and I could choose to not come back Oh never come back  There you are, giving up the fight Here I am begging you to try Talk to me, let me in But you just put your wall back up again Oh when's it gonna end  (Chorus:) How far do I have to go to make you understand I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far  There's a chance I could change my mind But I won't, not till you decide What you want, what you need Do you even care if I stay or leave Oh, what's it gonna be  (Chorus)  Out of this chair, or just across the room Halfway down the block or halfway to the moon  How far do I have to go to make you understand I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say Yeah I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far    I know how far you would go now .. it's time to walk away

      Some author wrote this by looking at film and then by doubling up the lines .. kinda hard to explain .. but go head and try and follow the directions i left ya and if you dont get it leave me a comment or two. Directions: Read the bold text first, then the plain, and then all of it normally.   Hey that's me caughty wolly unaware  recalling a "cloud" was once a "rock" or "hill",  I'm lookin out the window Standing there,  the clouds are framed and stationary still,  Seeing myself in this, I'm struck to find  they turn to erratic phantoms, and they float  Across the living room, in the back of my mind,  like empty cartoon bubbles, though you'll note  How little I have changed. It's the same old view  darkening now beyong the blue moraine  In the same old window I keep turning to.  a ling of thunderstorms and sheets of rain.       Here is my friend jesse from prom! he is an awsome guy lol i'm trying to get other pics on here but this is the only one its let me download so ill get back with u on some more!!

      Curiousty may have killed the cat; more likely the cat was just unlucky, or else curious to see what death was like, having no cause to go on licking paws, or fathering litter on litter of kittens, predicatbly  Nevertheless, to be curious is dangerous enough. To distrust what is always said, what seems,  to ask old questions, interfere in dreams,  leave home, smell rats, have hunches do not endear cats to those doggy circles where well-smelt baskets, suitable wives, good lunches are the order of things, and where prevails much wagging of incrurious heads and tails.   Face it. Curiosity will not cause us to die- only lack of it will. Never want to see  the other side of the hill or that improbably country where living is an idyll (although a probably hell) would kill us all. Only the curious  have, if they live, a tale worth telling at all.   Dogs say cats love too much, are irresponsible, are changeable, marry too many wives, desert their children, chill all dinner tables with tales of their nine lives. Well, they are lucky. Let them be nin-lived and contradictory, curious enough to chance, prepared to pay the cat price,  which is to die  and die again and again ,  each time with no less pain. A cat minority of one is all that can be counted on to tell the truth. And what cats have to tell on each return from hell is this:  that dying is what the living do, that dying is what the loving do, and that deads dogs are those who do not know that dying is what, to live, each has to do.      we read this in english class .. and for some odd reason .. it just took me and i loved it!! ENJOY!!

Let's see .. what did i do this weekend  on friday i had bball practice at like 6 to 730 .. it felt so good i actually run again and play with them all .. then afterwards we had a sureshot party cuz we won the state championship .. we had fun .. stayed there until like 10 i guess .. people were tooooo funny ... amanda .. being her nasty ass self .. burped and chunked food at me and cars .. omg things that make u go blahhhh .. then she chunked watermelon on my feet .. AGAIN! lol tami and sam tried throwing alex in the pool with all her clothes on lol and she chased me down the street cuz i threw water on her hahah lol toooo funny .. i love all my sure shot girls even tho we dont hang out all that much ... cant wait till nationals!!! oh by the way .. alex mundy drives like an old grandma! lol   then after the sure shot gatherin .. lol .. i went to jesse's house with dar and ed .. we had fun i guess but then chris got mad at me when i was talking to tj on the phone .. so yeah .. w/e   ..   then sat. me and dar went to jesse's again .. we drank and played super mario brothers 3 lol omg we are loosers!! haha but it was fun .. then we went to kelly's house to pick up shane but he wasnt there so we went there for no reason ... then we went back to jesse's and kristy and them were there in toga's lol so then me and linz left and took buige's car and went to mcD's and i bought people stuff off the dollar menu lol and they only gave us 2 pies INSTEAD OF 4!! lol then we went to kelly's house for a while ... that was fun lol buige wanted me to go skinny dippin .. but it was freezin and if it was a lil hotter i just might have lol then on sunday me tj dar and ed hung out .. i thought tj was cool untill u hang out with him for like the whole day ... i dont think he is the guy im lookin for ... not at all ... who knows maybe the guy for me is right in front of my face and i just dont see him ..  then last night i started to get really upset cuz paul had dropped off my cd player and my bball sweatshirt and he smelled like him and me being my dumb self had to smell it ... i miss that smell ... and i started to miss him and just start to think of things .. it wasnt good at all .. ed was talking to me .. i threw it in the hamper so i wouldnt have to smell it ne more .. buige told me to take it out cuz she wasnt going to stop liking craig so why should i stop liking paul .. but the truth is .. if i dont stop liking him then ill never move on and ill miss some great guy out there for me ... paul moved on ( even tho it seems like he is still holding on to me ) so why shouldnt i?  imma leave u with some lyrics .. yellowcard to be exact    Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Be strong. Believe.  Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Be strong. Believe.  Think about the love inside the strength of heart Think about the heroes saving life in the dark Think about the chance I never had to say Thank you for giving up your life that day    This is my favorite!!    Sew this up with threads of reason and regret So I will not forget. I will not forget How this felt one year six months ago I know I cannot forget. I cannot forget  I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do Follow me there A beautiful somewhere A place that I can share with you  I can tell that you don't know me anymore It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget And being on this road is anything but sure Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget  I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do Follow me there A beautiful somewhere A place that I can share with you  So many nights, legs tangled tight Wrap me up in a dream with you Close up these eyes, try not to cry All that I've got to pull me through is memories of you Memories of you Memories of you Memories of you    off to cip 2 i go .. presentations to see
