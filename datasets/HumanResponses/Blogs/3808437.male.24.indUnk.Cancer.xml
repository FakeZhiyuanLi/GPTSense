      So, today was the last day of the month.  Went pretty much like a big ball of crap!  But that is the exact same way it went last month, and the month before that, and so on and so on.  This is my first posting in my blog so im really trying not to keep it too long at first.    But on the flip side of this shitty day, I do get to go and smoke a nice cigar of my choosing.  This is a deal I made with myself to quit smoking the multiple swisher sweets that I do love but ultimately made me really stink....  And takes a little bit off of the occassional smokes I bum off of my bosses.  I find myself being somewhat guarded on this blog cause I almost treat it as a journal of thoughts and such....so you won't get anything good out of me yet.

      Today is just really blah.  Not much happening; glad my week is over halfway done.  I had this headache for most of the day.  Wonder if its my job?  Yeah probably is....  Speaking of which, im really debating on what my next move will be.  I don't know if I really want to committ to here or if Im going to move on to something else.  Im still trying to figure out some other stuff too.  I really don't mind this job; I could hang around cause my next step up I think I could be really good at, that's a bonus.  It really just comes down to the other stuff that will make or break me.  Most likely break, but hey, you live and learn.

      So its been a while since I submitted a posting.  Well, Friday the 2nd was my 24th birthday.  My kick ass team decorated my desk and even made me a cake.  Food day for josh!!!  Awesome team.  I ate like a frickin' pig, had a little ice cream with a friend too, that was really nice.  I also saw Spiderman 2.  It was really good, better than the first and Kirsten Dunst is just hot.  Wow, that Bubbleboy guy has it going pretty well for him.    I always have like the Fourth of July because it was always one big party for me since it was close to my birthday.  Well, put it this way, due to someone elses circumstances, I didn't even get to see fireworks.  No party for Josh.  Pretty much didn't go to two of my closests friends shin-digs for marital reasons.    So pretty much my entire weekend was kinda a wash.  I really wish that "The Reason" by Hoobstank would die a miserable death.  That song is just vile.    I went to the park today with the same friend that I had ice cream with while here at my cube.  She is really adorable and sweet, she got me a paddle with the ball that is attached to the elastic deallymabob. She always worries about me, since I act like im five, putting my eye out with it or swallowing my gum.    My mom is on vacation in Colorado, so I have been entrusted with the caretaking of her dog.  This is mainly cause I am her favorite child and, despite acting like im five sometimes, am pretty responsible, well most of the time.  Gotta jet and say goodbye to my job at least until 9am.
