       Am I your lonely desire, your most passionate dream?  That you beseech each night before you close your eyes to embrace the lovely world of dreams…  It stays with you every moment that you breath…  Every brisk step that you take makes you feel you are drawing closer. The next moment it dances around you like a beautiful fragrance on the wings of wind and flows past your fingers compelling you to follow it wherever it goes…   Am I your need or am I your leisure?  The only one whose touch can bring the world to life and descend upon you as the brightness of the sunrise and freshness of the morning dew…  The only one whose warm company brushes off comatose humor and disperses the weighing melancholy from the evening breeze…  The one that you seek when you feel worn out of the ways of the world and nothing seems right…  The one whom you can turn to and expose all your wounds and be cared for and pampered…  Am I the one? Tell me am I your need?   Am I your strength?  Who fills your heart with new vigor each time you feel weak…  Who revitalizes the fervor and gives you a new lease of life…  Who is the driving ardor that assures you will find your destiny despite all the perils…  The constant zeal that enables you to survive the ever so undulating surge of time…  The reassurance that everything would be fine…  Am I the core of such incessant and pure vigor?  Tell me am I the reason that you live for?   Or am I your love, your ultimate destiny?  The one whose thoughts fill you with a strange delight…  The warmth of whose presence you feel even if you are miles apart…  Whose sweet laughter tinkles in your ears and brings an innocent smile on your face each time you are lost…  The one whose tears you cannot endure for anything in the world…  The one whom you wish to accompany in the walk of life…  Tell me am I that treasured possession?  Am I the destiny that you seek?   Tell me what am I to you?

       Why does the Poet need a voice for his expression? Why does the Poet clamor for attention during his expression? Why does the Poet fixate on one point of view or one perspective and make the world aware of it or urge/force the world to look at it through that perspective alone through his expression? Why does the Poet try to change, through all the means and ways he can, the ways of the world using his expression? Why cannot the Poet, even after realising the fact that words can only, in the best case, be triggers, to bring about a consciousness, but can never be catalyst in affecting a complete social change, still fight for his ideals by means of his expression? Would the Poet at some time or another turn his back to the world, after realizing at the some point in his journey, that all he did was receive the torch from his predecessors before, who shouted and appealed on the top of their voices of the things that are amiss around them just like him, get disillusioned and leave his expression? Would the Poet make sure that torch would still be lit and glow bright by the time he hands it over to his successor, while shedding light on topics and issues, that he found worth shouting for using his expression? Why does the Poet need to be an idealist? Why cannot the Poet's pragmatism (practicality), cynicism and pessimism branch away from his idealism and join the mainstream talking about the regular beauty of the nature around and the regular everyday aspects of life? What makes the Poet continue on and on inspite of an impossible task ahead of him, inspite of an impossible audience that refuse to join him and inspite of the daunting opposing forces inside of him, that make his every step a hard and a heavy one, that make his every idea completely out of sync with the careless world around him, that finally make his very existence a conflicting one?     &nbsp;  The tone (and tune) of Struggle resonates through the empty halls of inaction whenever the Poet raises his voice and appeals to the world. His inability to adjust to the situations around him and his discomfiture in letting things as they are, unquestioned, unheeded and un-cared for, furthers his inner fire to billow out and lend the lone voice of resistance against the status quo. Apathy disturbs him, inaction concerns him, lethargy irks him, ignorance infuriates him. The inner struggle gets to the point that the Poet starts doubting himself, whether the problem lies within him in getting in tune with the world, leading a seemingly normal life, ignoring the issues and side-stepping the problems or whether the world is really on the road to self-destruction and he is the only one cursed to foresee the future, but still unable to stem the self-bleeding. On the path of the declaration of the war against the world, the Poet first tries to identify the problem, make the world aware of it, offer his version of the solution and continue chipping away towards the end, until one of the things happen - he gets completely dejected and joins the rest of the herd or time and energy catch up with him and silences his voice. While bracing up for the war, the Poet summons all the weaponry at his disposal - irony, satire, sarcasm, motivation, derision, belittlement, encouragement to spur the world and set the chain of events that would finally set it in motion towards his version of the same. The Poet blindly believes that given the right set of tools, creating the right set of conditions, and showing the right kind of solutions, the world would dance to his tunes and enthusiastically follow his lead leaving its past and present behind while marching towards its future as dictated and laid out by the Poet.     &nbsp;  In his blind and optimistic enthusiasm, he conveniently forgets that world he is fighting for was never behind his back in the battlefield, while he gets mauled in the field. The conditions dampen his spirits, the forces cut his enthusiasm at the knees, the issues make a laughing stock of his bravery. Alone, wounded and bleeding, resignation sets in and disillusionment follows. The world, whose situation and plight moved him in the first place, waits conveniently on the sidelines watching the ghastly scene without even raising a finger and coming for his neither his aid nor his support. Deserted by his followers and butchered by the forces, the Poet develops a deep sense of resentment against the weak world that refused to take his side, in order that it not be disturbed from its current position, however wretched it might be. Reality sinks in at this stage and the Poet comes to realize that it has always been the same, before him, with him and even goes to the extent that it would remain the same after him. The purpose that he was passionate about till then mocks him in his face, nullifying all the serious efforts that he has put in till date, proving that in the grand scheme of things that it is not change that is constant but it is the inability to change that is constant. The dawn of this realization upon the Poet takes him to the other end of the spectrum - the one where cynicism and pessimism lurk around, waiting to embrace yet another voice with open arms. The Poet would there find himself in the august company of the past and the present voices that have tried equally, if not more, to impart their vision and their version of the world on the existing conditions. The Poet would still struggle in (t)his new position, and continues to make noise even at this new forum.     &nbsp;  After the struggle has come full circle - war cry, bitter defeat and ground reality, the Poet starts to pick up the pieces analyzing the causes for his defeat. The goals were more ideal than they were practical, the plan was more outlandish that it was implementable, the dream was more a dream than it was real. Once the Poet comes to an understanding with himself that it was his modus operandi that has to be faulted rather than the goals and the dreams, he changes his voice to reflect more of hope and optimism than of bravado and brashness. He realizes that society could be changed but only in a brick by brick fashion, than confront the entire system head on, and try to tear down the entire structure without exactly revealing the blue print for his vision of the world. When he breaks down the task in steps, building solutions for each step, suddenly the success or failure of his solution does not faze him, for he is well aware that change is never a variable of time. The Poet lets go of his ego at this stage and is merely contended to keep the torch bright so that he could pass it on and see his dreams realized much much later after his time. The Poet comes to terms that followers or not, listeners or not, he owes it to himself to welcome the signs of the change and become the harbinger of the eventual shift.     &nbsp;  There comes a point in every Poet's career, when he chooses either to ignore his inner calling, just because he is defeated and dejected, or dust up and get back right on the horse to wage his battle all over again, again and again. Should he choose to remain with the latter, the churning of his inner self (antar madhanam) and whirlpool of his ideas and ideals (antaranga madhanam), would never let him to get off the course, guiding him (and the ones who choose to follow him) to that brave new world, where ideals become implementable and dreams turn into reality.

       It's 10:30 pm. Time for bed. But somehow I can't sleep. I have to leave for college at 6:30 tomorrow morning. Stress has become so inherent in our lives that if it's not there then it seems as if something's amiss. Oh, no its not another droning stress diagnostic.      I had been going through a few blogs, surfing through the random expressions. So many thoughts, so many emotions. Musing over why people need to put down their thoughts on a web page. Has it become the easiest medium to do so? Maybe. Or is it that it's a place to escape from the monotonous jostle of daily life.       A buzzing world where one can take a plunge in the depths of fantasy. The enigmatic charisma of this boisterous space cannot be undermined. This place seems like heaven. Sharing thoughts and emotions is good. But does it matter? Being content is what matters more. As time wafts maturity dawns, it's no longer a necessity that others read you and be impressed or opinionate your musings. I still ask myself, why write it down? To look back at it after moving ahead in time? Does it really matter if someone reads my thoughts? There must be someone who can understand without me having to say a single word. And that someone is what matters most.      However this doesn't subdue the importance of writing and expressing oneself. Everyone needs a space, a personal space, where he or she can escape to, to unwind. A solitary space that is so hard to find in this vivacious world. Besides, cramming the words on a web page is better than cramming the numerous thoughts inside those microscopic brain cells. If those miniature elements wish to be free and blown up on a larger canvas, then they should be.    Why tie yourself up? Speaking out one's mind often disperses the heaviness and glum hanging about the heart. It's integral to all beings. The very soul is restless, twitching under obligations and itching for freedom. Freedom cannot be defined precisely, though. Here, it maybe this trance that engulfs us but terminates as soon as we're out of it.      Even though, in this medium, one can't be sure of being read or being understood and pointed out in the crowd, it's a fab place to be in. These musings express individuality and somewhere or the other reflects the essence of each and every one of us. Veracity and spontaneity are the two bare bones that captured my attention. These impeccable thoughts, they do edifice the mind. No it's not about pure entertainment, it's more about contemplation. A felicitous spot for all those who are not punctilious about writing instead they do it coz it comes straight from the heart.      In all, it's a consummate affair.

      I just removed the article named 'PREREQUISITE FOR POETRY- STRUGGLE' from my posts. People are thinking i'm a poet of some sort and an extremely emotional person; well i'm not and would never like to be. I don't beleive that life is just a poetry and that we humans sway to the tunes of the rhymes. Well i think life is a battle to be won; That probably explains my ambitions to become the 'DICTATOR OF THE WORLD'. Human race should read and talk about me until it becomes extinct. My great great great great grandson should study history from books which have my photograph on the cover page. I'm starting to learn to shut my emotions, because you have to develop a HEART OF LEAD in order to win in the battle of life. Of what use is the life which passes-by unnoticed by the world in which your death is only mourned by your family and which is just 'another death' in the wide world?. That's why I want my death to be something which is discussed for generations to come and is mourned by every sane person in the world as the death of THE GREAT INDIAN WHO RULED THE WORLD.

      I’m really looking forward for my engineering college to start; it means new campus, new professors, new friends, new hostel, new subjects and a new life. Last night I was thinking it would be better if I can manage to write down a note of every thing that happened in my life as far as I can remember, so that I can have no trouble in reminiscensing things for writing my autobiography at a latter age.  The following text was written by me some two years ago. Just thought I'd put it up here.  ||||||||||| |||||||||||| Mrs.Kusuma was my first nursery teacher at Happy Model School to which I usually went on a rickshaw. I still remember the school so well even though I did not once go there after I left it; The morning prayer and VandeMataram done in the backyard; myself sitting in the corner of the class room being scared of talking to anyone or gaining the teachers attention. Then began my actual schooling at St.Ann’s Eng. Med. School, which was by far the best school in the town.  I went to the school on the school bus crying all the way. My first friend at school was Sushma who sat beside me on the first day of my school and continued with me until I left St.Ann’s; she was always the best student in our class and was the class leader. Mrs.Transfield was my LKG teacher to whose house I frequently went with my parents for many years until I left St.Ann’s. Mrs.Jennyfer was my class teacher when I was in UKG; I don’t remember much of her though except for her huge Christmas tree and the small glass of wine she offered us when we went to her house.  Ms.Hema was the teacher of my 1st std., I remember her to be really beautiful; there was a time when she scolded me for my bad handwriting and she herself praised me for improving my writing latter.  Mr.Clinton was my class teacher in 2nd std.; I wasn’t having a good impression of him at that time because he used to conduct daily tests and punish everyone who didn’t fare well in the tests, but I was a really good student anyway.  I remember Mrs. Sujata Suresh, who was our class teacher in 3rd std.; she was such a crank pot and a really scary looking woman with whom I had to go to school in the auto until I left St.Ann’s. Sr. Virgin Mary was my mathematics teacher that year; she came to my house along with Sujatha teacher and had dinner with my family after praying for us. Mr. O.V.Ramana taught us Science and Ms.Girija continued to teach telugu this year also after 1st and 2nd stds.  Mrs. Narsamma was my 4th std. class teacher who taught us Mathematics. Mrs.Saradha taught us Social Studies. Mrs. Suguna taught us Science; everyone in the class of 60 students was scared of her. Mrs.Sujatha continued to teach English. Mr Mallikarjuna Rao taught Telugu that year; he was such a sport but strict teacher. This year the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of our school took place in such a grand scale with atleast 6000 people who came to watch it besides being telecasted live on TV.  Mr. Ojha was our class teacher in 5th std.; he taught us Hindi and used to punish students mercilessly. Mr.Thompson taught us mathematics, Sr. Deepa taught us English; she was such a good teacher and I was her favourite student in the class of around 70. Mrs.jansi taught us telugu; she was very particular on hand writing and made us copy write daily. Sr. Josmy taught us Social Studies; she is my all-time favourite teacher who had a style of her own; she conducted regular quizzes and all. Mr.R.V. Prasad taught us Science. I usually sat in the first bench and the first two benches were like a group; we studied together and played together.  Sr.Josmy happened to be my class teacher in 6th std.; she was a really young nun who had a cool glow on her face. Unfortunately she was transferred somewhere else at the end of the year. Mrs. Don taught us Mathematics that year; and I was her fav. Student in the class. Mrs. Mahalakshmi taught us telugu; she was famous all round the school for the vigour with which she punished students. I was lucky enough to escape her fury as the doctor warned her not to get excited after a small accident.  Mr. Nagendra Prasad was my class teacher in 7th std. Mr. Nageswara Rao who was known to be a brilliant teacher taught us Mathematics. Mrs Subbalakshmi taught us English. Mr Mallikarjuna rao taught us Telugu. Ms.Brazitta taught us hindi that year. Sr.Deepthi taught us Geography. There was this girl by the name Harsha dambika in our class who usually topped the class. You can understand how it feels when a girl who competes with you academically in the class comes to you and says I LOVE U. I wasn’t finding any words on my tongue. She had a very pleasant face. She latter understood that I was reluctant and did not talk to me ever since; but she came to tie a rakhi on Raksha Bandhan for the next 3 years I studied with her.  Mrs Girija who came from Singapore the previous year taught us English in 8th std.; she was a really good teacher. Sr.deepti taught us History. Miss.Suzikutti taught us Geography. Mrs.Nirmala taught us Biology and Chemistry while Mr.V.V.Ramana thought us Physics; he was a very good teacher but the worst critic I have ever seen, he finds a fault with everything literally. Mr.Nageshwar Rao continued to teach Mathematics this year also. This was a pretty messy year in which I started noticing girls. However this was my last year at Sr.Ann’s school. I remember the glorious building, which taught me for 10 years and laid foundation for my whole life as strong as its own foundations. The huge school is worth its weight in gold. I can never forget the classrooms in which I studied and the grounds on which I played for 10 years. I’m waiting for the day when the grand school can proudly teach its students about its old student (me) who is the most respected and known person in the world.  The next two years 9th and 10th stds. I studied in NNT School, which was established by old St.Ann’s teachers. It was a small school and it was like a family. All the teachers were young and were such a sport to be with. I remember Mrs.Hafeeza who taught English, Miss.Yamini who taught us Physics, Mr.Muralidhar who taught us Biology, Mrs. Vasudha who taught us Geography and economics, Mrs. Sarvani who taught us history and civics, Ms. Sireesha who taught us Biology, Mrs. Maheswari who taught us Physics, Mrs. Vishala who taught us English, Mr.Bhaskar who taught us Physics and the directors Mr.Nageshwara Rao, Mr Nagendra Prasad and Mr. Thompson Eliot. I can remember the farewell party we gave to our seniors in 9th std., the party given to us by our juniors and the one we gave to our teachers in 10th std., the Teacher’s day celebration in which I staged a play along with my friends. And how can i even dream of forgetting the excursion in 9th std. which covered Simhachalam, Annavaram where we took a bath in a small canal, Borra caves full of enchanting rock formations and stalagmites, Visakhapatnam which was a beautiful city ; the view from atop the Kailasagiri and the beach. And the best of all Araku valley with spellbinding scenes donned in natural beauty and chill, to bear which i had to wear two sweaters and a monkey cap. The journey from Visakhapatnam to Borra caves on the train was the best as the train passes through 28 tunnels; the water falls on the left and the deep green valley on the right holds your mind glued to the scene. The enjoyment in bus with all my friends and teachers for nearly four sleepless days was once-in-a-lifetime experience.  No one wishes to forget the days of his childhood; as a Telugu poet prays: "Vundo ledo Swargam; naa punyam naaku echhaye. Naa sarwaswam neeku istha; naa 'baalyam' naaku echhaye." meaning: "I don't know whether there is a heaven or not; give me back my merit. I will give you everything you ask for; Give me back my childhood in return"  (Wow, and do I preach, this halo round my head is getting to be very uncomfortable though, I would gladly replace it with the devil's horns to feel at ease ;)  Current Music - Krishna - Colonial Cousins

      Life's back to normal again; after Sweety, Chitti and kutti went back to where they came from. The last three weeks were like the best time in my life apart from the two years at hostel. Not another thought came to my mind except spending my time with my darling cousins. Although the family reunion takes place every two years, this time was the best as we are all older than we were the last time and that led to better understanding among us. We four raided all the icecream parlours in the town and put them into business. The soft ice cream machine at Home Needs must be missing us cause we all used to have atleast two rounds of icecream every evening. We ransacked the Bangalore bakery out of its puff supply and Anand sweets out of their sweet supply each day. I'm not forgetting Priyanka restaurant for the wonderful Butter chicken and Chilli chicken. However Chinna could not be with us most of the time as he had his examinations to cope up with. Every one of us enjoyed the trip to Godavari river which was in its full flow even though we could not go boating in it.  I'm going to have a hearty laugh every time i pass by the tiny island in the middle of Godavari about which Chitti was very excited and wanted to buy it for herself. I will neither forget the animated chats we had nor the the usual teasing each other.  But i'm not at all dissapointed that i'm all alone again because of the optimist in me who looks forward for better days in the next reunion.  Current music : Gurtukostunnayee.......

        Garfield and I live very ordinary lives, like any other fifth cat and human (resp.) would. We do have our differences in opinion, he smacks spiders, I shudder at the very thought; he chases Odie, whereas for me, dogs are OK. He proudly admits that the only thing active about him is his imagination. !!Bingo!! and that's where we hit it off! (The only reason he doesn't blog is because he prefers jabbing away on the remote than on a keyboard)

But lo and behold, the moment your hands reach the neck, he wriggles his way out and transforms himself into a pigeon.   Some days, irony stares at you in the face, so close, you need not even stretch your hands to gouge its eyes out.  Current Music - The instrumental theme from Lakshya

      Oh no! I have been putting up too many posts on love. I just can't get to understand it though. The case with me is 'An idle man's blog is the devil's work shop'. I'm just sitting in front of the internet having nothing else to do literally the whole day; it's goin' to be this way until my college starts, and that's not before a whole month passes by. The last month and the forth coming one are the two extremes; it's like this: U spend a whole month (which seemed to have passed away in a second) with ur favourite people and the fuckin' next month(which seems to be going on for ever....) with no one to look at. I'm grabbing my chances to while away my time though; the whole afternoon yesterday I was enjoying with my friends speeding away on the roads of Raj. That's all for now...

      Love is a global phenomena.. Love could happen anywhere anytime... Love has happened to you...love has happened to me.. Love could happen at wierdest of all times...its always a surprise... at times when you are just sitting over a boring lecture.. I have felt that happening...and it hurts! I still don't know what is the purpose of love...may be i'll never know it.. may be love makes us stronger...may be love helps us fight the odds in life.. may be love is a learning...may be love is knowing you are right or may be that you are wrong.... When ever i am in a love situation.. i always look at the opposite sex. do they feel the same...? do they know that its mutual...do they know that they are going through the same "love" as i am??...and i have always found the answer to be yes..! But surprisingly...!! After i am done with love...and i think about others, say, when i ask anyone (not necessarily the opposite sex) how does it feel to be loved ?.. the answer is always in a same template "Got Scr**ed.... or not !"  I don't know if that is the intention of love is to scr***.. but that seems to be the end result of it.. I hate that.... i hate it like i never hated anything before.. to me love has to be harmless, effortless and undemanding.. to be free from any obligation... love can't be graded... love is love.. but whatever love i see here...its not what i like... So from the deepest of my heart i hate love.. yes I hate love...! But needless to say......love happens..again and again..!!! though not regular thesedays...but it still happens..  All these inferences takes me to an obvious conclusion.. Love is like anything i hate...a global phenomena Unstoppable...all you can do is enjoy it.. for eg, re-read the whole passage with "quiz" instead of "love" it should make sense... :-))  I just don't understand love.

            "Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we will redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance .... We end today a period of ill fortune, and India discovers herself again." - Jawaharlal Nehru (Speech on Indian Independence Day, 1947)    The day when India woke up to freedom back  in  1947 was a day of great celebration. A country got rid of her foreign yoke and became a sovereign nation, she celebrated her sovereignty on this day - the triumph of numerous martyred souls. It was a day of fulfillment, it was the day of a new beginning, a birth of a nation. On the stroke of midnight, a country came into life again as the British handed over the governance of India to the Indian leaders. The long and difficult struggle had borne fruit at last, though the happiness was marred by the fact that the country was divided into India and Pakistan and the violent communal riots had left the countries permanently scarred. That was the price that India paid for her dearly bought freedom. The British government declared the country independent and left for their own shores. On the 15th of August, 1947, India became completely independent. It was on this historic date that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime Minister of India, unfurled the Indian tricolor on the ramparts the magnificent Red Fort, symbolically marking the end of the fucking British colonial rule.   HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY  - Jai hind

      Just yesterday when i was sitting on the same old couch of mine, not barely but clearly i remembered the gone by time...  although the daily hassles never let us remember our past, but the silent surroundings do spell the nostalgic cast...  those were the sunny days untouched by the ponderance over sanctity of life, we were so bounded by love which made us ignore that natural strife..  no matter what, i remember my foolish feats, i still feel the pounding of age old beats...  thinking about those days bring tears to my eye, i want them back what if the rivers run dry....  just then a sound from outside makes me come back to reality, i don't care if people do call it superficiality...  there is no sense in things i speculated, the good old days are out and amputated...  i know time won't roll back nor it would stop, past is untouchable now and i just can't hop...  with these immaculate thoughts in my mind i still am baffled, desire of mine is like a distant star which just cannot be grappled.........................

      Oh God! Yes, Chitti and Kutti were right after all in predicting my boredom before they went away. I'll have to wait until the evening when I can drop a visit to any of my friends house. I got up at 9 'o' clock and have been online since with nothing else to do apart from watching the Olympics where India hasn't been faring well. I have been chatting with Sweety for atleast half an hour before lunch and a meagre 10 mins. after lunch. I think she's as fed up with boredom as me, and to make matters worse she can't walk properly due to the minor operation on her foot. Any way her college begins the day after tommorrow and she will engage herself in no time with new friends and stuff. I haven't any such luck as can't dream of my college opening before atleast a month passes. Chitti and Kutti will be starting today for London; it will be another two years atleast before they come back. This fucking boredom.....      Never does she leave me, notwithstanding my frantic attempts to keep her in a safe distance. She is all over me, heedless to the utter disgust, that I have developed in immense.  Though I despise her to the core, I have had this live in relationship, for more than a decade now. Every night in my room, before I catch up with forty winks, hmm, to elaborate my etiquettes don’t allow.  I might be her only Love, but that’s no reason for me to be caught in her trap. I cannot be married to her, for the rest of my life, fine if you brand me, a stone hearted chap.  Persistent, I can’t let her get, or allow her conquest of my life, ‘coz I don’t see it as a positive sign. I desperately need to find a way, to beat her to death, this damn '  boredom  ' of mine.

      R.S.Rathore broke India's olympic medal jinx creating history when he bagged Silver. The ace shooter ranking 3rd in the world gave India its first silver medal at Athens 2004. The 34-year-old former army Major who fought insurgency in Kashmir during his tenure with the Indian army, is only the fourth Indian to win an individual medal and the first shooter ever. Well I believe this is just the beginning... Wait until Anju Bobby George comes out with the Gold and Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupati duo strike gold in Tennis. Three cheers to Rathore.... Three cheers to India...  For further information follow the hyperlinks below:  urlLink Report by Sify   urlLink Report by Rediff   Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore Born: January 29, 1970.  Major achievements: Commonwealth Games champion, 2002; Bronze at the World Championships, Nicosia, 2003; Gold in World Cup Sydney 2004; Gold in Asian clay shooting championship, Bangkok, 2004. Current ranking: 3    Current mood: happy Current music: Sare jahan se achaa...
