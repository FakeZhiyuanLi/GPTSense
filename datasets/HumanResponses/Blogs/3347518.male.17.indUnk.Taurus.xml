      it was pretty fun. lemonsoul was dec as always. i had my heart restarted when a tent blew on top of me and about killed me. freakin' scary. most everyone left though except hilary and liz who were high but pretty chill, kinda psycho though. by fire played there, this hardcore band from bellefonte. i liked their music, but not the singer, she was a little freaky. one of the bands where i can't tell what the hell they are saying but it sounds crazy. im pretty sure the lyrics are actually 'love thy neighbor' or 'always share' or something like that.

      -this is one of my oldest theories- we have, according to the bible, been wearing clothes since the time of adam and eve when they learned vanity. from that time period until the early 20th century, we have kept the same amount of covering we have had, and even slowly added covering. those who did not wear ample covering were presumed to be prostitutes, tramps, or maniacs. in the early 20th century, we saw a revolutionary change in the basics of fashion. as men left to fight in world wars I and II, the women replaced them in the workplace, and with this new found sense of responsibility came a want or even a necessity to break out of the shell. womens clothing became more and more skimpy until the present day. mens fashion was soon to follow. today, clothes are still even skimpier than the year before. this leads me as well as my colleagues bonsall, griffin and vidmar to conclude that the amount of skin coverage on ones body in relation to time would follow a parabolic curve, time zero being at t=-2000 (bc) give or take, and the graphs minimum at approximately t=1910. by following the graph along, you might see that that there is a Ac(amount of coverage)=0 value at t=5820. we conclude that by the year 5820, we will be totally naked. yeah, thats right, we will just be walkin around in the nude 24/7. dont want that girl you like to see your boner? too bad, because its right there, you cant hide it.

      today was pretty uneventful. i had to wake up at an ungodly hour to take my dad to work so i'd have the car. then i drove to vidmar's to pick up my backpack at like 8 am and stood at his door thinking about ringing the bell but i wimped out and just went home haha. then i made 5 different mixes for mt. TOP: soft rock, ska/reggae, hard rock and metal, 'fun' alternative, and of course, weird. on the weird cd is a great song called mummer's dance by loreena mckennet or something like that, you all should download it. i plan to burn the discs this evening. at 12 i had guitar and had the shit scared out of me cuz i was doin like 70 on that new fake corl street extension and this cop car flew by me. anyway after guitar i finally went to dans to pick up my backpack and i figured id just chill there for a few minutes until tom came but tom was later than cicadas in centre county. while waiting vidmar put his new drive-by truckers cd in and it was pretty awesome, like driving southern...well...truckin' music. finally tom came and i took them to hannahs but i had to go home and mow the lawn but on the way home i decided i didn't want to mow the lawn and instead me, my little brother, and shawn went out and bought fireworks and set them off under my sheds to try to harass this big fat groundhog who lives in our lawn. it looks like a pile of crap from a distance until it finally musters the strength to move...yeah thats right, kinda like my fat-ass dog salsa. there you have it, feel free to turn your head into the window of my soul and stare like youre a peeping tom. peace.

      hello everyone. i know you've been missing out on your fixes! ive got a lot to talk about. first of all, last night was the most fun ever, thank you to all parties involved. you are not sinners. also, next year theres this mock presidential election, right. i need everyones help to run me as an independent...apparently there are independent primaries, so i am looking to win that and kick some GOP ass. please, if you want to get involved (and all of you should), talk to me about it and hopefully we will come away with a victory. especially if someone wants to make me a website or some kind of campaign logo or slogan type deal, that'd be the best. unfortunately you can not run as my VP because its like the real primaries; someone is chosen and then they choose a VP from the losing canidates. so i do encourage you to run as democrat or independent and if i lose choose me as your VP haha. yeah you know what else i found out today? fahrenheit 9/11 (the new micheal moore movie) comes out on the 26th i think. i'm probably buying advance tix and going the first showing haha. it looks like the most flamingly liberal (and i'm not that flaming) movie ever. he is a genius. dang school is finally over. its an awesome feeling that i have to do no critical thinking for another 3 months or so. and i have mt. TOP in a few days which is gonna be very kickass fun. manual labor is the best. i wish i wasn't smart so i could be a construction worker or something. i wish i wasn't so modest so i could flaunt things a little more. anyway thats all for now.

      What is there to say about our trip to Stone Harbor.  It all started on a Friday morning, way too early after a night of drinking at my brother’s place.  I had intentions of stealing booze during my brother’s party but ended up drinking it instead.  Thank god for Sarah who saved us by giving us the half handle of shitty rum she had left over. We drove there in a minivan that lacked proper air conditioning.  (Mitch enjoyed the heat thoroughly).  Mr. Lillie kept hyping up this weird card game that he had just bought and little did we know that this would be one of the highlights of the entire trip.  We arrived to the Jersey shore with Mitch behind the wheel and the distinct scent of crustaceans filling the car.   	We arrived at the beach house and I, being the dumbass that I am could not figure out which direction to the beach.  But anyway, we laid our shit in the tiny room that would occupy all three of us for the week and headed for downtown to scout it out.  I got blisters on my heels because I didn’t tie my shoes and Mitch failed to warn me of the 10 block hike to get there.  Nothing interesting happened except I saw my brother’s ex but I didn’t want to talk to her because I wasn’t sure it was actually her.  With very little luck with the ladies, we decided we’d smoke a bowl that night.  In a cozy little end of a road, we smoked and decided to go see anchorman, the single funniest movie ever.  Before it started though, we made numerous trips in and out of the movie theater to go to the bathroom.  Mitch was determined to get soap from the soap dispenser.  I don’t think he realized that half the dispenser was missing including the soap container.  This also made us quote the movie the rest of the week, especially Vid (knights of Columbus).  We decided to hit the bikes up for easier travel back and forth.  Mitch got the kickass Lance Armstrong bike, I got the women’s purple bike with curved handle bars, and Vid got the shaft with the men’s Mongoose mountain bike. 	The next day we went to the beach to boogie board.  I was not fond of the numerous jellyfish that inhabit the jersey shore, especially when Mitch tells me that they swarm you in the ocean.  We decided to walk down the beach to scout out ladies and accomplished nothing.  Oh wait, a seagull took a shit on my arm.   That sparked a new found hatred for the sea gull, and from that moment on I was at war with them.  Now Mitch and Vid got quite burnt.  They had ritualistic rubdowns in the bathroom of this stuff called body butter.  If you walked in our beach house at a given time, you might suspect us of being homosexual.  Anyhow, later that day we went and smoked up again.  We ate some pizza and Vidmar had Salad pizza which was insane to say the least. We also went to get fries and there was this EXTREMELY hot Lithuanian chick working there, and I think we were all mesmerized by the mirrors on every side of the store.  We went downtown only to be shot by some crazy girls with bows and arrows.  We ran into them like 3 times and finally got their numbers.  I’ll tell you, remembering their names when your high is hard, Maddy, Mara, and Sabina.  Vidmar broke a key rule in picking up chicks.  He gave them his number but failed to acquire theirs. 	The next day we were bored and learned to play Crononauts, the single best game invented.  If you saw us playing, you’d think we were a bunch of crazy nerds, but it is absolutely hilarious to play.  This game served as a time occupier when we got bored, needless to say we played often.  We wandered to the girls’ house and they came running out.  We sat on the sidewalk and talked to them for a while and then decided to hang out with them that night.  W e met up with them after and drank rum and Gatorade (horrible choice) on the beach.  We soon found ourselves paired up with girls, thanks to Vidmar’s clutch charismatic move.  We later found out that they had somehow planned who would be with whom.  So Vid and Mara were rolling around in the sand near the surf, Mitch and Maddy found sand closer to the dunes, and Sabina and I decided to snag a lifeguard chair to avoid SAND.  It turned out to be a wise move.  So we had our fun and then went home.  We played some crononauts and ate cheese sticks Vidmar-style. 	We went to wildwood which was a kickass board walk.  We found out that Mitch’s fastball is 17 MPH.  Vidmar got complimented by a very ghetto fab black man on his hair.  On numerous occasions we were almost hit by the tramcar.  I attempted to hit a few sea gulls with Rob’s inflatable Spiderman bat.  When we got home we played some homerun derby in the front yard.  Vidmar is king of that might I add.  Many of our games got slowed by Mitch’s constant need to take a shit.  I’m pretty damn sure he took more shits that week than the rest of stone harbor combined. The rest of the week is kind of a blur because we got fucked up too many times.  We went to cape may and fought sea gulls when we were eating dinner on the pier.  You know, the usual throwing lemons and pennies at them.  Mitch and I wanted vidmar to buy JEWISH apple pie, but he didn’t.  That night I remember drinking quite a bit of rum with Vid and wandering around.  We tried hitting on a bunch of probably 14 year olds but they are those gay people that are into the wannabe skater/surfer kids so we were kind of out of luck there.  We ran into the 3 chicks from before a few times and the sexual tension was so thick that you could cut it with a knife.  But we came up short that night and were sitting on a bench.  That night I found out my great uncle died.  I took it pretty hard because he was basically like a grandpa to my brothers and I.  But I was still semi drunk and we sat on the porch for like 4 hours talking and calling random people on the phone.  We may have played another round of crono, I'm not quite sure.  I woke up and had to be driven to meet my uncle so that I could go to Pittsburgh for the funeral so my beach trip ended there.   	(To know what happens the rest of the week or anything I didn’t feel like repeating, read Vid’s and Mitch’s takes on the week.)

      Prelogue:  We spent much of the weeks prior to our expedition planning and preparing for two major concepts.  Getting retarted every night.  And hooking up with girls.  The strategies for the former include stashing a handle of Jaquins finest rum (gag me) and an eigth of pot with a bowl kindly donated by Mr. Mathew Price.  As for the latter, our main strategy was roaming the beach during the day and the streets of downtown during the night.  Devices such as frisbees and footballs were also to be used for "fishing" on the beach (throwing a ball into a pack of girls and retrieving it with a kind 'hellooo').  Chapter One  ARRIVAL:  The car ride down was about like every other trip i have taken with these dudes... lots of sleeping and listening to music.  But ya know I'm down with that and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  When we got there the house was pretty small but I honestly couldn't care less.  So we set out to the streets to find ourself some bitches and see what kind of stores were around town.  Toked on the first night in a small outlet to the water from one of the streets, opened up a fresh pack of Marb lights and the week was off to a good start.  We were rather unsuccessful on the first with the ladies but it wasn't a big deal.  Watched anchorman.  Fucking hilarious.  Couldn't laugh much cause I was too stoned but I sure as hell laughed my ass off the next few days over it.  On our long walk home we decided that the bikes in the garage would be of good use to us considering its a good 15 block walk to downtown.    Chapter Two  CUPIDS ARROW:  Ok so during the second day we got up and went down to the beach to board our boogies off.  It was a good time although we kinda sucked it up.  Not our fault the waves were gay.  We smoked again and set out with a more determined attitude for the girls (me and tom at least).  As we were making our circles downtown and wandering, a group of three girls were at a corner with some fake toy bow and arrows and as we passed them they gave us a "hey wanna get shot".  We let them take a couple shots at us and went on our way.  Note: Mitch thought the girls were college age.  Later we passed the girls again and we talked for a bit and finally when we passed them the third time we exchanged numbers and had a good long talk.  They told us they were going into junior year and they went to an all girls school near philly but they lived in NJ.  Meet the three girls:   Maddy-- an outgoing chipper young girl with blonde hair and a somewhat manly voice, but fairly attractive nonetheless.  Good at keeping the conversation going and often hilarious.  Fun girl.--    Mara-- while still a talker, she was a little more relaxed and came off as intelligent and kind.  The granddaughter of the folks who did the signature and the whistling sound for the Walt Disney logo.  Very attractive girl overall.--    Sabina--  This girl was being rather quiet the night we met her, and her Italian cousin Mussolini followed her around that night giving us a false impression of her true self.  As we got to know her, we found that she was the loud, obnoxious, fun-all-the-time, party girl.  Thats a good thing by the way.  Very very attractive.  Downright sexy.--  Chapter Three   CHRONO-WHATS?:  Chrononauts.  Its the game of time-travel and destiny.  Tons of fun.  I won the first game played.  Played all week.  Chapter Four   SHOTGUN FOR THE LIFEGUARD CHAIR:  First thing I must explain is that mitch at this point was acting almost like a zombie.  I mean he was a fun guy and laughing it up and playing cards and talking.  But when it came to the girls he didnt care much about them.  He lacked motivation towards them and also admitted that he didnt understand that these girls were like gonna hang out with us.  Too stoned that night or something.  Anyway, we rode the bikes over to the girls house cause they hadnt called us yet.  Not that we are stalkers but we were bored.  They came running after us and claimed they tried calling but it was a wrong number.  Thats all not important.  We were gonna go to a movie but decided instead to go just to the beach.  We brought some rum for the ladies and mitch smoked but me and tom drank.  The beach was basically empty at that point at night (10:30?)  So we drank for a bit and sat around talking.  Was not drunk at all, the girls were and thats good enough or me.  Aaaaand then since I'm the "charasmatic one" (so mitch and tom say) and basically I'm the one with balls, I said "I'm going for a makeout walk in two minutes, whichever one of you wants to get up and go with me, we can have some fun 100 yards down the beach".  So when I got up the girls looked at Mara as if she was the one that was to go with me (i guess they had talked about it).  We hiked on down like 50 yards and did our thang.  Mitch and maddy hooked up and tom and sabina (after a slow start) did their thang on the lifeguard chair.  One lesson me and mitch and maddy and mara learned was that messin around in the sand sucks.  It just sucks.  Sand everywhere and I mean everywhere, it was really fun but a tad uncomfortable.  Still an awesome time but mitch seemed to not be having that much fun.  Went home and played Chrononauts.  Chapter Five   THE DOGDAYS OF MIDWEEK:  the middle of the week all becomes a blur in my memory cause we just walked around trying to find other chicks.  Mitch got his enthusiasm back and it was fun but not successful.  We got really frustrated a couple nights.  By the way, the other girls claimed they got grounded which we know was probably a lie but it worked out because it was almost like a joint agreement between us and them that we were all gonna find other people to hook up with.  One night stands are good and why not try new people.  Us and the girls agreed on it without ever speaking about it.  So the frustration of no new girls started to set in as we would play more and more chrononauts and chill at the house.  Chapter Six   WILDWOOD:   I dont remember when we went to wildwood but it kicked ass.  Big ol boardwalk pretty crazy in case you didnt know.  A ghetto and I mean ghetto black man told me my "doo is off the hook".  Made my day.  Mitch bought a kickass Coheed and Cambria shirt and there were some other cool stores there.  Chapter Seven   "WHERE THE HELL IS THAT COMING FROM":   When we came home at night we would sit out on the deck for a good four hours talking on the phone or to each other or eatin food.  About halfway through our trip, our nightly porch sittings became interupted by some water balloons.  These weren't normal water balloons.  These things were coming from god knows which direction from at least 60 feet in the air at a good 50 miles per hour.  Probalby would have broken a window or knocked robbie out if it hit em.  Freakin scary at first, not that we are poosies but these things were really comin in fast.  Every night we would try to find out where it was coming from and we never could see.  They just kept comin though.  We came to the conclusion that God was dropping balloons on us as a joke or it was Mr. Lillie or it was some scientist testing his nuclear launcher.  We also tried to make a molotov cocktail because we are arsonists and wanted to burn their house down.  Actually we just wanted to see one but it didnt work.  We got pissed.  Waste of time.  Chapter Eight   THE TRIUMVERATE IS SEPARATED:   Tom's great uncle died on Tuesday and he had to be driven to pittsburgh so that he could see the funeral.  That means he left wednesday and me and mitch were left to fend for ourselves.  It was sad to see him go and the week kinda lacked something without him.  Chapter Nine   TEEN NITE IS OBVIOUSLY FOR LOSERS:   We were gonna head over to this teen night thing but it turned out there werent many people there and it looked homo-retarted.  So we walked around instead and met these chicks from Philly suburb.  These girls looked about 13 but said they were 15.  Either way mitch didn't care because he likes it that way and he was more into these girls than anything i have ever seen.  He didn't give a hoot about the nice hot juniors we met early that week.  But these 13 year olds hit his spot (and i know he doesnt mind me saying this haha).  So he 'went for them' and got a phone number and i went along for the ride cause there was one girl that looked older and was decent.  Before I go any further I must say that from the moment I met them I could tell that these girls were the ABSOLUTE TRASHIEST MOST INSANE FUCKED UP LITTLE GIRLS IN THE WORLD.  They acted like they were trippin on acid all the time and tried to steal my cigarettes and mitchs weed and would hang up on us and call us and hang up and call.  It was waaaayy too much for me.  But i went with it for mitchs sake.  They ended up being so gay that we couldnt really get them to hang with us much.  So that went downhill fast.  Fine with me.  They still call mitch with their insane antics and one day recently they told him their real age.  I'll let your ask him about their age or leave it up to your imagination...  Chapter Ten    HOMEWARD BOUND:   The week ended with us failing to even hang out with those crazy girls.  It was kinda a dismal ending in my eyes.  Mitch saw it differently.  For some reason he thought that we were trying hard at the end and not at the beginning.  I disagree, maybe he was trying hard at the end.  I can see that.  I felt better about the first half of the week cause those girls were nice and down to earth, and it was better than nothing.  Without Tom it seemed to be missing something too...not that the end of the week wasnt fun, i just felt like we were starting to wind to a hault.  We headed in the car for the trip home and slept and listened to music again.  Fun.  Epilogue    TO SUM THINGS UP:  It was a good week.  It was a great week.  I learned that Jaquins rum tastes like shit.  And that as hard as you look for girls, they usually end up finding you.  I learned to always grab the lifeguard chair when youre with a girl on the beach.  I learned some Jersey slang.  And that you never can take for grantid time you spend with your two best buds sippin booze, lightin the bowl, or just haning out playing cards.  High school is wrapping up fast and its times like this that you can look back on and enjoy.  And finally I learned that the best medicine for a sun burn is body butter.  Use it.  Love it.  Don't eat it.

      hi, i'm mitch and im gonna show all you guys out there how to get girls. it's a master plan developed by me, tom, and vidmar.  now here's what you need if you intend on going for the three pronged attack. first, you need the hot one, in our case, tom. hes gotta be pretty tan, with a nice body, and just generally hot to girls. next, you need someone with charisma, someone who isn't afraid to start conversations and keep them going, in our case vidmar. he's gotta be pretty outgoing and a pretty likable guy. finally, you need the wit and dry humor of the group, in our case, me. he's gotta be on top of things, and not afraid to make fun of the girls to keep them in check. with this formula, you three will go out on the town, and be an unstoppable force to the ladies. oh wait, no, no that's not right. all three could turn into pussies; the hot one could keep his shirt on most of the time, the charismatic one could start saying 'hey' to the girls in a creepy old man voice, and the witty one could just shut up and stare into space and act like an idiot. then you end up sitting there hating yourself until some bedwetting/jewish/boyish/young/annoying/supposed lesbian/trashy girls come up and talk to you.

      ahh at last...the entry you have all been waiting for. i know, i know. this is my side of MOST of the week, vidmar might be posting a 'guest column' telling his side, which will probably be a little better haha. where do i start. first of all, none of us were exactly normal the entire week, so i'm doing my best to recall it. i guess we saw anchorman first, though i forgot most of the movie, it was funny. next we learned how to play chrononauts, the most hilarious game ever. you'd think we were losers if you hear dus playing it, we sounded like 'dude, do not flip that linchpin, i have the patch for that, i was so 2 turns from winning, but only cuz i have this quick trip to the future' we played it the whole week. the big question everyone seems to ask is did we pick up any girls? yes, yes we did. three from south jersey, and we had some fun on the beach with that, though the sand does get VERY annoying very quick. i wish i had snagged a lifeguard chair like tom and pee pants (a very hot chick with a urination problem) but i guess i was stupid. anyway then they were making up stuff so they wouldn't have to talk to us again, which was fine, because we wanted to move on too. still, there were a few awkward moments in there. anyway so then later in the week tom had to leave due to a death in the family so me and vidmar were left without our hot body to get the ladies. but we tried to get them nonetheless. SO we meet four girls from a philly suburb, according to dan, 'the four trashiest girls ever'. we didn't know they were trashy. ok we did, but that's beside the point. we ASSUMED, however, that they wanted to hook up, and that they were somewhat sane people. ladies and gentlemen: never assume. they were pretty much psychos, they would be like 'ok meet us at the movie theater' and then not show. so we got fed up and we were pretty blunt with them and it ended in them prank calling us on thursday night and us kinda pissed. but at least we were trying, unlike the first half of the week. it was a good time.

      here's where i tell you what i'm listening to in music right now and who it sounds like. Melissa Auf der Maur: former hole and pumpkins bassist goes solo. sounds awesome, like garbage when they were good and hole. perfect for those of you who want to pretend like 90's post-grunge alt rock is not dead yet haha. best songs: 'followed the waves' (the big radio hit), 'my foggy notion' The Killers: electronic indie rock. very good. sounds like the cure meets any electronica music group. don't be turned off by the electronic thing...i usually hate it too, but not in this case. check them out. best songs: 'on top', 'mr. brightside' Snow Patrol: happier indie rock. sounds like death cab for cutie. i can't download a lot of songs from these guys because limewire is crappy and choppy with certain bands. from what i hear of them, they are sweet though. best songs: 'velocity girl', 'fireflight'

      for those of you who don't know, every weekday from 12-3 on ESPN radio a man named jim rome takes the mic. he is the single funniest man ever, hands down. thats not the point of this post however. the point of this segment of post is reality tv. rome has a little saying that goes, 'if you like reality tv, you are stupid'. it's probably the most true thing ever. you need to lack so much intelligence to enjoy those shows. the whole thing makes me wanna gag like an olsen twin and her dinner she just ate. for those of you out there who like reality tv, who you really are are closet dungeons and dragons fans. you love the idea that you can pretend to be living another life, whether it's through 'real world' or the roll of your 21-sided die as you race, elven bow in hand, through the haunted woodlands. then again, i shouldn't compare d&d to real world; at least characters in d&d don't have cry baby emotional fights, they duke it out with their swords or magic or what have you. i was watching tv today and i noticed one of those bladeless razor deals for women, you know, kinda like nair. first of all, me having to watch this guy shave his woman with one of these things made me so sick i just wanted to suck on the tailpipe of a ford bronco. anyway, again, i'm off topic. so what really pissed me off is that the commercial was STILL riding the 'new millennium!' train. now hold on mitch. the 'new' millennium came 4 years ago, right? how is that new? well in defense of the fake nair company......NOPE. i got nothin'. they are obviously flaming idiots. we have all had enough helpings of 'new millennium' crap into our gastric bypassed stomachs. just because the pop culture is obsessed with vintage stuff does NOT mean you can go back 4 years and still expect to be cool. did people talk about the '96 olympics in 2000? no, we were talking about other things. so for the love of GOD stop talking about it. its over. thank you and goodnight.

      everyone, it's time for you to check out a sweet band, death cab for cutie. (www.deathcabforcutie.com) it's really nice soft indie rock and its highly recommended by yours truly. check out 'title and registration' on my shared files on AIM... if you have cable, then getting it directly from me is probably faster than limewire or kazaa or whatever you're using. i got new shoes. ones that weren't ones that were suggested by vidmar or katie, my two fashion consultants haha. they are puma. they are cool. i got a lot of new stuff today actually. board shorts for the beach, the shoes, and a book on how to speed read. it ACTUALLY works. the first thing you are supposed to do is follow your finger underneath where you read, that way you don't go back and reread, so you don't waste time and you learn to read well the first time. i went from 300 words/min to 450 in just doing this. pretty amazing. that's about it.

      i suppose the 4th of july calls for an entry. it had all the makings of a huge letdown. no one was down there, it was pouring, people were calling us and making us walk all over when they weren't actually there, and so on. but it turned out to be pretty cool. there is a certain point when you're so wet you don't get any wetter and you become comfortable with your wetness and accept it and then it is quite refreshing. also if you were standing close you would see that the misfired fireworks explode into a crazy awesome fireball that beats any of the actual fireworks. and there were people to chill with. erin, megan, courtney, that whole crew was there and i was with them for a while. i was with vidmar practacally the entire time. i saw ken, beth, and michelle (raney) about 30 times. we ran into thigpen, k griff, and fran a bunch too. ben booth drove me and vidmar around to some random shady places. it was a fun time. then last night my parents prompted me to sleep in our new portable hammock, its really awesome, except i sleep on my stomach, so it was pretty uncomfortable. (think about it, its like i was doing some acrobatic move). so then i had guitar today but afterwards i went to turn my applications in to jimmy john's and panera. then i had a one dollar limeade from ben and jerry's which was very good. thats all for now.

      i know, as usual it's been a long time since i've written. there is much new news. which begs the questions can news be assigned an age or maturity, and is old news still news? anyway, let's start from the top (pun intended), shall we? mt. top was last week. for those of you who don't know that's where i go bust my ass for jesus in tennessee. it was pretty fun i suppose. and i use fun not in describing the spiritual aspect but in purely the social aspect, just to clarify. i have been there, i have been on the 'right path' and it was...i dunno just kinda drab. so here i am now. i still go because it's usually a lot of fun, and was, for the most part, a good time this year as well. i met some crazy people (christin and ashlyn aka kristin) who taught me who taught me the greatest song ever. its called the rigabumboo (spelling?) song and its a classic camp song complete with hand motions. and i bought the coolest recorder ever from the goodwill store in tennessee. its all ghetto, like the ones you played in 3rd or 4th grade or whatever. its fun but its really odd to play, like i don't think i yet understand the way it works, because i'll cover up a hole and the pitch won't change. i need a flutist or a clarinetist to explain it to me. so we got home sunday night, and i did nothing really until tuesday, when i got applications for jimmy johns and panera. hopefully i'll get a job there. then some night in there i went to hazi's surprise party, which was rockin', let me tell you. there were probably 10 people there so me and vidmar left for some campfire where i didn't really know anyone, save megan and vidmar. so i stood there for about 20 minutes haha and then left to go to vidmar's to watch monster, which is a really good movie about this woman who looks like a man and her life sucks because shes a hooker and she becomes lez but keeps hooking guys anyway and... i'll let you see the movie. its really good, probably in my top 10 (which i really need to post on here sometime). speaking of movies, last night i saw fahrenheit 9/11 with caitlin. a hilariously funny and liberal movie, i encourage everyone to see it, especially conservatives. it might just change the way you think about stuff. that's all for now, later.
