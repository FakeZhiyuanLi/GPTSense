      "To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead."- Bertrand Russell. This is a very interesting quote I found in a book I'm reading. To fear love, a big part of life, would be the same as fearing life. You would fear the only things you care for and care for you hopefully. Fearing life would be fearing all things including the good with the bad. Happiness is an emotion that keeps us alive and without love, it's not an emotion you will feel. Do not fear love. It may hurt and tear you apart, but you musn't hide from it. You'll never know if the feeling is mutual or not unless you find out for yourself. Show your love and express it with the greatest enotion possible. Show people you are happy and you live and love to the best you can. This seems like a hard thing to do. Trust me, it is. But you can't live in fear for your whole life. That's not what inspires people to want to be around you. Understand that life will bring you happiness when you want it. Not when you need it. Looking for happiness and living for happiness are two different things. Live to find happiness. Show you are happy and people will follow.

      "Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience."- Victoria Holt. This is an interesting quote that I found the other day. The purpose of this quote is to recognize that everything happens for a reason. Every choice you make can either be bad or good. The bad ones allow you to learn from this mistake and apply what you've learned to your everyday life. The good ones give you some type of happiness that you don't have to regret doing. Life has twists and is going to throw some crazy ones your way so your going to make some bad decisions, but hopefully you'll learn from them and fix it so that you will live happy. Regreting something is the same as feeling bad for yourself. Don't do it and you can't be depressed. Forget the past and learn from it.

      Writing is more than an assignment by a teacher or just making a book. Writing is a state of mind that allows you to use your mind as a tool and understand things better. You endulge in your own world and make your own rules. Noone can bother you because you are so focused that your mind blocks everything out allowing you to continue. The best thing about writing is the feeling you get after you write. You feel complete because you were able to tell your true feelings. Even if you write by yourself and allow noone to read your writings, that feeling is still shown. My writings will be based on truth and my feelings so I hope you enjoy them. I will show facts about life, love, the world, and many other subjects that purtain to you and me. Hopefully both you and I will learn something from my writings. Quote of the day "I never think of the future - it comes soon enough."- Albert Einstein. My explanation for this quote is that you must live life one day at a time. Don't worry about the future to come. It will come and you will see what happens either way. Forget about fear of death and think about life. The future is unpredictable so stop trying to figure it out. Life will give to you what's rightfully yours. This will in turn make you much happier because fear will be a lost emotion.
