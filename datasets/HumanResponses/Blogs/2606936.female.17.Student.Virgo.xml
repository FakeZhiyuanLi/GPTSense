      So.... what's up with the new Jewel, anyway? I was looking at CDs on Amazon.com and saw her cd which is called "0304." Her identity keeps goin' funky. I mean, she's quite pretty, and has always been the pretty natural girl, which gave us hope........ and I am just not into this whole DIVA thing......  She went from being (a little creepily, i may add) folky with "Pieces of You," to being really earthy with "Spirit," to being a little more rock-y with "This Way," and now this pop goddess phase. The following are all actual songs on the CD.   2. Run 2 U    5. 2 Find U           8. 2 Become 1                     11. Yes U Can           12. U & Me = Love         Erm. I guess the number title was appropriate..... If you'd like to sample them you could go  urlLink here ....   but I haven't even listened, so whatever floats your boat.

      I have a gut feeling that the charge on ammonium is -1 or -2.... maybe. I cannot for the life of me remember the charge on chlorine. I took chemistry last year, so it's not a big deal. However, I am trying to figure out the formula for ammonium chloride.  Our band directors are out of town at a state music teachers' convention, so in band we were sitting around and "studying." My friend L walks into the room and looked a littel down, so i'm all "hey, what's up?" and she just asked where some other girls were. I pointed them out and as she walked off i saw tear tracks on her cheeks.  She came to me about ten minutes later, beckoned me away from the crowd, and told me, "B's getting expelled."  I immediately assumed something had gone terribly wrong and was like, what the heck did the school try to pull on us now..... and asked why.  Turns out she and another girl, during a lab in their chemistry class, randomly thought it would be a nice idea to drink ammonium chloride.  She freaking drank a chemical in a high school lab. After all the safety contracts we have to sign, after all the rules we have to memorize, and while they're even protecting your SKIN from it.   This is so weird. The other girl, everyone tells me, is pretty dumb and reckless. But B? She's got more common sense than that. I don't know if it was a dare, or what. L said she was laughing about it and said, "Oh, I don't know why I did that...."  She could be expelled or suspended..... It makes absolutely no sense. IT's the kind of ridiculous story chem teachers tell to wake up kids. Like, the one about the boy who put sodium (sulfur? some S-starting element that combusts upon contact with water) in his front pants pocket and then went swimming. B's story will become one soon.  How can you ever know someone? I mean, we weren't freakishly close, but I would have given her the benefit of the doubt. Who the hell drinks ammonium chloride in school?   To all of you in my locale, please don't comment on this here, because I don't want to further the gossipy crap already perpetuated.  To all of you out there in Blog Land, please try to refrain from randomly ingesting chemicals you're told not to ingest.

      "Hearts are worn in these dark ages...." -Sarah mcLachlan  I was so hoping that this year wouldn't suck like the last one. Truth be told, mine hasn't been too bad, except for me AAAAH not havingthe scarf   But everyone's breaking up.... which means that there is an awful lot of bad stuff swirling in my locale. And that the spite wars are far from over.  I think tomorrow I will wear my "Boys are Stupid, Throw Rocks at Them!" t-shirt. I love this shirt, despite the fact that it is baby blue, which is an incredibly unflattering color for me. I wanted the original one i saw in some magazine, which was pink, but alas, I could not locate the store.   When shopping, or dragging the Schnig around the mall, or something like that, I came upon this shirt in a store I normally would never have gone into.... and I had to have it. Yes, I was shopping with a boyfriend, but WHAT A GREAT SHIRT.  It is the shiznit. It is bodacious and tubular. It is so very.  I never actually wore it in front of HIM until after the breakup.   Man, i treat that kid horribly. I ignore him like, um, an ignoring thing..... I mean, I smirk whenever he attempts to address me and ignore him even when he opens doors for me.... I mean, he opens the door at school in the morning because it's locked, and that's what you do, you open the door for people in the morning who want to get into the school, not because he's being chivalrous or some crap like that, as I had previously thought. See, he tends to make rather odd friendships in which he insists on carrying stuff and helping people all the time. SOOOOO obviously he will open the door for everyone, but he'll run faster if they are a)cool or b)pretty or c)not me, since I am obviously both *cue hair flip*.  He doesnt' do it on purpose. Of course it isn't his fault he metaphorically pantsed me, punched me in the chest a few times, kicked my stomach repeatedly, and somehow removed my heart, ran over it, backed up, and did it again, only to attempt a hug.....   But I still cannot bring myself to greet him.

      Today, I attended a very cool Anti-Defamation League Youth Leadership Conference to Stop Hate. It was, as Heather would say, so very. However, I do not want to go into the meaningful part of it. No, I want to talk about the hot guy I met!  Now, at one point, they gave us sheets of paper. Half of us had words, and the other half had definitions. I got matched up with a rather lovely lad from another school. He was a self-proclaimed hippie environment kinda guy. Usually I find that rather weird, but when he's pretty, he's pretty!  Our word was "scapegoating." For the less vocab-ulated among us, that is blaming a person or group for something that is not their fault. Case in point - Jews being blamed for economic crisis in post-WWI Germany by the Nazis.  SO we're trying to think of "personal" examples, and I'm trying to break the ice over the fact that neither of us had experienced it. Him: "So.... well... I mean, there was the Holocaust...." Me: "Yeah.... don't really know of any others. DO you?" Him: "No, and I've never really been scapegoated or anything." Me: Me either. *pause* Me: But, ah, it has "goat" in it, and goats are pretty cool, so..... HIm: *smiles at my patented blend of beauty, intelligence, and oddness* Yeah. I'll a gree with that. *laughter* Me: DO we have to explain it to them? Him: Um.... I don't know. but if we do, I'd definitely go with the goat escape. *laughter* SUpervising kid: Ok, so y'all are going to make skits. Me: OK... so pick another animal. Him: Um.... one that pertains to a goat situation? Me: Sure. Whatever. Him: a rooster. Me: OK. SO let's say it's been raining a lot at the farm,a nd the rooster's like, "It's the goat's fault!" Him: *hahahahaha* Me: SHould we use something else? Him: No, I think rain is fine.  SO, we come to perform our little skit. I read the definition.  Him: Wow, it's been raining a lot lately. That's not very good. Hey, I bet it's because of you! Me: What? Me? It's not my fault! I'm just a goat! I don't control the rain! HIm: Well, how else do you explain it?  It then deteriorated into the laughter of the rest of the group and us doing our best barnyard arguments. Cute, but not incredibly productive. I was trying to figure out how to end it....  and I   head-butted him   on the shoulder.  Head-butting is an inside joke with my friends. We do it at random as a fake fight instigation. It is quite funny to watch. If planned, in a skit, it makes people laugh. The group was falling out of their chairs and stuff.  However, I do not suggest randomly head-butting people, especially those of the opposite sex in whom you have the capacity for interest. Because i was too afraid to talk to him at ALL for the rest of the day.   America's young leaders: pretending to be barnyard animals.....

      Two kinda sad things.  1) I think i'm going to skip my junior prom.  I did not particularly want to announce this, but a friend recently made a similar one, and i thought it'd be nice reading for those who know me not.  You see, since the end of the AGe of the Boyfriend, i have been attempting to muster interest in other guys. This, i have done, but not exactly with results. I have crushes that go from minor, to obsessive, to "enh," within the space of a week. I have yet to reveal this to anyone of interest. I do not expect any interest to be revealed to me, either. I think I'm kind of intimidating. People notice me, but I don't need them to fall in love with me.  Also, I'm still in the depths of both pathetic sadness and pathos, although i can often rise above it. So probably, a date wouldn't be worth taking, because I'd just be all comparative and shit. So unless i fall madly in love sometime in the next few months, we can forget a romantic prom.  I do have a few friends i could go with, but the only reason would be to get a dress and get pretty, and they'd probably be at a point where they'd take me for fun, but be staring at another girl all night. Why weigh them down?  Not to mention the fact the the Schnig will probably get his new obsession to come with him. I don't want to see that. I shouldn't have to.  I don't dance much, I have no real love interest, I don't want to watch him with someone else.  If Steve-o is brave enough to state that he doesn't want to go, i can too....  2) Tomorrow, i shall attend the Anti-Defamation League Conference to Stop Hate. Expect a barrage of confusion from me tomorrow, because it's being held at a Holocaust museum.

      ok. everyone needs to go to  urlLink The Fudge Said No , because it's a rather funny blog...  oh wait. hmmmmmm. The site has exceeded its monthly bandwidth allowance!  hmm.... i wonder how? Just how DID the bandwidth exceed itself, hmm?  Probably from jerks who are too lazy to save pictures on their own servers, and instead link to them from the website!  All right. I don't exactly understand what that means. All i know is, try very hard not to link to pictures that are online unless absolutely necessary, or  1) the "bandwidth" will get "exceeded" and           1a) the site will be shut down, and          1b) the picture will disappear bc it is no longer online, or           OR  2) If you are using up bandwidth, the person hosting the picture will get pissed and do  urlLink this.   This is also why i do not attempt to post pictures here, especially of myself. For the sight of my lovely face would surely incite all of you to include it on your own websites, and the all my bandwidth would be stolen....   It's possible Mr. Fudge managed to exceed his own bandwidth without outside help, but i doubt it. Anyway, it's a good opportunity for a PSAabout the evils of internet theft. Speaking of INTERNET STEALING-TYPE PEOPLE....   Oh, screw this. i'm not the internet Polizistin. My neck hurts and i need sleep. Go to  urlLink Tequila Mockingbird  for further reading.

      ever had braces? if so, remember having them adjusted, and how your mouth was sore and stuff?  imagine having that feeling in your NECK.  (if you've never had braces, imagine soreness every time you turn your head more than two inches or so.)  Yet, there's a triumph in this pain!  You see, there's this wonderful way of relieving tension known as ACUPRESSURE. basically, the idea is that when you have a knot in a muscle, you force it to relax by apply pressure. It's easy to do to yourself... What you do is take either your finger (or if you have nails, the flat end of a pen) and push into the knot until you feel that "good hurt" and hold it, either until the pain goes away or until you can feel your pulse in it.  Well, today, while waiting for a friend to get off work so we could all go out, i was sitting with two guy friends,a dngot one of them to hold a pen against this awful knot at the edge of my left shoudler blade that i've probably had for months. The muscles in my back actually twitched when it released! Unfortunately, now that my upper back and neck are all loose, my neck is SORE from being tense and clenched for months. It actually hurts when i laugh, which isn't good considering i went out with friends and then watched the movie  Clerks.  But whatever....  i suggest anyone who (a) attends high school, (b) works, or (c) has children, try acupressure. It is absolutely fabulous, because event hough i'll be sore today, my neck is so wonderfully loose! Extend that recommendation to all wind players and singers as well....

      I absolutely positively LOVE german.  i get tired of the whole "guttural, short, efficient" stereotypes....   if you've read stuff like shakespeare and even scarlet letter, you've seen the patterns of speech they use, but not all of it. german has a rounded syntax, so the sentences just roll out, in waves, swelling and relaxing. They phrase themselves like music, so when someone reads German poetry well, it sounds like a chant. Each syllable, each word, is separated by the breath so that it's all articulated clearly, but there is always resolution. If you know what a periodic sentence is in English, that's the closest thing i can think of to compare it to. But german - !  The inflections of the voice, of questions, anger, uncertainty, sarcasm, all feel so much more natural in german. The sentence always ends, either resolving the entire piece, with a soft, low tone and a crisp cut-off - "Das habe ich noch nie bevor gemacht." or with a question! - the beauty of a German question, carrying the melody to the next speaker, growing in intensity, volume, inflection, ready for the next entrance. "Was denkst du?"  It feels like a crime to interrupt someone because it disrupts the pattern. if you don't allow them to finish their ideas, it takes away from the song quality, because there's no verb, no action, no movement. "Das ist die Maedchen, die ich sehr gut bevor-" man kann da nicht nur - wait - crap - sorry. You can't just stop there, you have to hear the rest, you have to know what happened, to feel the emotion behind the words.  When you speak long sentences, it sounds like a Romantic melody, one long, clear, stream of breath, interrupted only by the tongue. I love to speak in it, just to hear my own thick, loud, obnoxious voice transformed into music.   It seems so much more natural. So many words sound like English, use the roots we know so well, but the way they feel in your mouth are so much easier. "The" vs. "die;" "tanz" vs. "dance"; "that" vs. "das/s" - if you know German, just take a moment and speak. Don't read, don't recite - speak the language, feel it, let it roll off your tongue in swells, and you will feel the resolution. You can feel the connection with other speakers, why any language is so important.   With German, i marvel at human creation, that people were able to develop something so aesthetically pleasing, using only their own minds, their own voices, their own need to communicate and touch others. It;s like, they only needed a way to comunicate, but they gave it these patterns that are just so perfect and so beautiful, and it's entirely human. I feel like if i had been born speaking it, my poetry would flow so much better. German is always crowding the back of your throat, begging to be brought into the world for the joy and enlightenment of other people. it's like when you hear music that gives you chills on your neck, and you try to recreate it with your own poor voice, and the attempt brings tears to your eyes. The emotion, the beauty, the joy and pain, the sheer humanity behind language, is what i love about it. Music creates a mood, creates feelings that are shared by listeners. A beautiful language can both create the mood and communicate concrete ideas.   That's why literature is so amazing. The awesome thing about good song lyrics is that it's poetry - the form of language closest to the human spirit - but it has that untouchable, unreachable music behind it.  this is what makes me happy, truly - knowing that it's possible for a human soul to make something so beautiful, because if someone else can do it, so can i. i want to create beauty, or at least perpetuate it, honor it, reveal it to those who are too afraid to look in familiar places.

      i have come to the following conclusion: I am a sadist.  Well, not like a physical one, but an emotional sadist. I think.  Maybe that isn't the word I want....  Well, the point is my ex-bf's depressed mood actually made me feel better about myself today, but when he perked up, my mood went downhill.  This morning, I was just kinda chattering to someone about band stuff, and the guy he was talking to was like "Hey, Audrey!" as I'm leaving the room. I kinda turned and was like "Hey!" but the Schnig definitely snorted . I dunno if it was a "wow, what a stuck-up bitch" or "she's been ignoring ME, why would she talk to YOU?" snort, but it was definitely a snort. I guess one of us has to be rude in order for the world's energy to be in balance....  But then suddenly after school, he was all happy and stuff. And this shouldn't have any effect on me, but it's like, "Dude, can't he EVER be depressed?" The kid just doesn't care.....  Argh. I mean, it was so nice to see him visibly acknowledging my ignoring him.... and then he went back to NOT showing it!   How is a jerk like me supposed to get any happiness with stony-faced emotional ironmen like that around? My geez.

      The worst songs ever written.....  - "I Wanna Be Bad," performed by Willa Ford, a blonde who attempted to be the anti-Britney by dressing like a slightly more punk slut, but singing the same songs.... "I wanna be bad, you make it look so good...."  - "if I was Invisible," performed by one Clay AIken. This song is supposed to be all sweet and sad and stuffm, but it's really creepy.... "If I was invisible, I could just watch you in your room..." Obsess much? He also states, "I would be the smartest man if I was invisible," wrongfully implying 1) that invisibility is not only a good idea, but a measure of intelligence and 2) that he is a man.  - "Can I Get Your NUmber?" performed by... um.... wait, let me look that up. Ah, that well-known group known as No Authority.     (?)        anyway, this song goes "Can I get your number, baby? Hit me with the seven digits!" I mean, how European-naive is that? "7 digits?" What about the area code? Hello, welcome to America, land of the free  and  land of the 10-digit phone number..... This is just asking for her to blow you off. But then, if you tell her "I've seen blondes, and brunettes, and some really hot redheads, but I've never seen a girl like you," chances are she's going to blow you off anyway.  - "Hey Juliet" as performed by some group that has a number in their name. let me look it up. Nope, it's LMNT. We'll save the commentary on the name for another post. Anyway, this song is just a little too cutesy and upbeat to use allusions to Shakespearean tragedies.... are we supposed to believe these guys are in a "homeroom class?" Obviously, if they ARE in high school, they've never read "Romeo and Juliet," because he thinks they could just "run away".... This guy watches a girl in homeroom, pages her incessantly, and dedicates songs to her on the radio, all to be eye-rolled... and yet he firmly holds that "You really want me!" Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, honey.  - "Just Got Paid," as performed by N'SYNC. Number one - I doubt a paycheck makes a whole lot of difference to these guys. Number two - they say "ho" a lot. And they don't mean it in a disgusting, chauvinistic way - which can never make for a good mainstream non-Christmas song.  - "E-mail My Heart," performed by Britney Spears. This would be a cute idea for a country song if it was a love song with a computer theme. Actually, Weezer could do it really well, too. And I guess a pop song could do it too..... But it has absolutely nothing else to do with email. She's like "I miss you, I love you, email my heart and tell me you love me" or something. It's just a cheap attempt at being "hip and trendy." Also, they hyphenate "email," which is about the most "I'm so-dorky-i-don't-even-use-a-computer" thing that can be done, unless you are a German, in which case someone decided they could do whatever they wanted to the language, and you can't really be blamed for being forced to spell it "E-mail" or not ever use ß's. (more on this later....)  - "Heaven," by Live. I definitely thought this song was by some terrible religious-band copy of Matchbox Twenty... I don't know if Live  is  a religious band.... but it's never good when you can guess the next word in a song. Rhyming "believe," "perceive," and "decieve" is rather trite, especially when you're talking about religion. "Percieve" is one of those "big" words they use to sound original. I should knnow, I use it all the time in lit papers. And what the heck were they doing playing a sucky song about Christianity on normal radio?  - "Baby, When the Lights Go Out" by Five. Not only does this song have horribly-disguised sexual subliminal messaging, they also say "second verse, girl" before the second verse, which clues you in to the carefully formed song structure, and how much the guy is waiting for the song to be over... wonder what HE'S planning.

      i would just like to announce that   my ex-bf has dropped out of my last-period class!!!!   this makes me immensely hopeful for many reasons:   1) One less hour of being in the same room with him every day. Don't have to look at him and make myself sad!  2) He isn't there walking there! No more depressing reminders on the way to class! No more watching him restrain himself from groping other girls when directly in front of me! 3) He isn't there walking away! Even fewer depressing reminders on the way home!  4) Don't have to listen to his retarded comments and convince myself that they are indeed stupid! Or remember when I thought they were funny!  5) Don't have to watch him humping anyone's leg outside the classroom! (this is, of course, a crude and metaphorical denotation of what actually takes place, but the sight is nonetheless both disgusting AND heartbreaking!) 6) Don't have to talk to him when he thinks it's appropriate to discuss dates we went on! Don't have to listen to him bugging me about whether or not we went to this or that movie! Don't have to listen to other kid snickering at me bc he's so insensitive about it!  7) While i'm at it, I don't have to talk to him, period! No more acting like seeing his face doesn't rip my heart up in new ways and put me off food for several hours! No more polite ceremonial conversations!   I AM FREE.... or at least freer than I was last semester. He's still in band, which is where he acts  more like an ass than any other class, but at least i'm free of him for one more hour every day.

      I have six pieces of jewelry that i wear every single time i leave my house. These are: my grandmother's engagement ring, my class ring, my sapphire ring, 2 Nominations bracelets, and a watch.   The other day i was taking them off before bed and my grandma's ring fell off the dresser. I heard it hit wood, so i knew it had fallen into one of the two open drawers below. However, i dug through them and couldn't find it.  Tonight, after work, i finally pulled the  two drawers out and dumped all the clothes out. These were my two "main" t-shirt drawers. The top one has mostly cute, tiny little shirts i wear all the time, and the bottom is mostly the big souvenir t-shirts i wear to sleep and practice and stuff.  Digging through the first one,  i found two GHP shirts i hadn't worn in months. GHP, if you don't know, is an AMAZING summer program i went to last summer. Basically, high school sophomores and juniors are nominated in one school subject, anything from math to art to German(as I was) to dance. You go through a series of auditions or interviews, paring the number down to a lucky 675 that get to go spend the summer on a college campus, studying their subject. There are no grades or tests or anything. You learn only what you want, and everyone there has a love for learning. It is also a once-in-a-lifetime experience, because you can only go as a student once.  GHP changes people. It makes you hate the stupid people in your school even more, for one thing. You get used to the freedom, to being trusted and praised. You get used to only studying what you love. You get used to the friends that are all worth knowing, that are all intelligent and talented. People leave and find their old friends too shallow, or end up breaking off pre-GHP relationships because of how they've grown more than their partner.  I should have broken up with The Schnig while I was there. I did, actually. I thought i was gonna be ok. But he called me back at 3:00 AM and begged. It was sweet. I took him back.  Several months later, he dumped me and broke my heart. It hasn't healed yet. We haven't spoken in weeks. We haven't had a real talk in MONTHS.  Anyway, at GHP we made t-shirts at the drop of a hat. There was one for each hall students lived on, one for each major class(German), and one for each minor class - you chose one other subject to study. I took a Brass minor, since i play French horn. I also got the t-shirt for Pink Appreciation, which was a tongue-in-cheek organization celebrating the fabbity-ness of the color pink. They had shirts for the Homosexuality and Society discussion group, which i wish i had gone to so badly. I am probably the worl'ds leading straight fighter for gay rights. I think i was probably afraid of seeing that side of my friends, though - the side that condemns certain people being able to fall in love. Or else I was spending too much time on the phone with the Schnig. But people made shirts for IB, for Asian Pride, for anything and everything.   It's incredibly fun to wear them because no one understands the inside jokes, except sometimes the handfuls of school-people who went. You pass in the halls and have an instant bond, a nod at their shirt, because they understand, even if you've never really talked at all.  GHP was amazing. There are times when someone reminds me of it and I miss it so much I literally start to shake. I wore the German shirt to Nixie's sleepover this past weekend. That one isn't as great because it's in German, so people would rather say "een goot klaze abber een bibshun kamch" and laugh maniacally at their cleverness, than ask me what "Eine gute Klasse, aber ein bißchen KOMISCH" means.  (FYI, it's "A good class, but a bit ODD(funny, strange, etc)"- "komisch" literally means "funny" but it has a connotation of being somewhat off, weird, whatever. Thanks for asking.)  I think i'll wear my brass shirt tomorrow. We're starting school again after break and I'm going to need it to give me some confidence with all the stupid gossipy little asses there.  Not to mention the Schnig.

      I slept over at Nixie's last night. It was quite the bodacious event. We watched movies and all that good stuff.... Spirited Away, if you've never seen it, is something that MUST BE SEEN. We decided to have a Spirited Away party someday and dress up like characters. D is going to be the Radish Spirit, which is like this big walking white tuber with a red hat and loincloth. He rocks the cat spa. I wanted to be Lin, who is this cool lady who's all like, "You're in BIG trouble!" but i think i'll be Yubaba the witch, who has a big nose and hair.... too bad i can't put pics up here.... oh well.   They do have two cats, which was not so good for me. I have a cat phobia. Seriously, i looked it up, it's called Galeophobia. Napoleon had it. It must run rampant in the short gene or something.... but yeah, i came in the house and the first thing i say is, "CAT!" because it's all trying to crawl on me and stuff.... Why is it that whenever i babysit, and come over and they have a dog, they're like, "Oh, i forgot to ask if you were afraid of dogs" and i'm like, "No way, i love dogs!"..... yet, if they have a cat, they never think to ask if i'm afraid of cats.  This is just more proof that cats are slowly taking over the minds of AMerican suburbia, with the intent to  undermine and ultimately destroy my attempts to help the poor.  (They play with yarn while i'm making charity scarves. The n00bs.)  ....... getting back.......However, D actually brought her tarot cards, which she'd never used or anything, so i did tarot readings for everyone. I sure am talented... Lace was screaming and playing with, like, a talking book or something and we were like, "Don't disrupt the flow of positive energy!"  But i did myself, and i'm like "When am I going to actually love someone again?" and it's telling me the past is like, wealth and stuff; present - what was it? like, withdrawal; others think i can't move on; i should try not to make enemies; and, if i do all this, i will long for a lost love.  NO SHIZNAT.  aaaaahhhhh! That's it. I'm never dating again.

      I am so friggin' giddy. Jitter was here and we were writing our script for our independent film that's going to change the world.   National History Day Project. Enhhhhh. But it's all about Freud, so there's a small degree of woot to it. *dances joyously*  Gotta love people who think they know a lot about psychology. I mean, hello, not only have I read on it extensively, I've BEEN to them! AND talked a lot about the craft, not just me..... so hearing someone be like, "Oh, I LOVE Sigmund Freud!" is just aggravating. It's so pretentious. The mind isn't something that can just be laid out and studied. I mean, yes, there are people with "issues" but that isn't how it works. It's complicated and emotional and there is most definitely a reason why you need training for it. There are bookoo pppl out there who are going to major in psychology. But they don't want to practice. And half of them shouldn't practice! Just go do studies, please don't walk in with someone thinking you can break downt heir mind into defined problems.....  But anyways. Freud was weird but quite a smart man. And so we're detailing how a traumatic experience caused a boy to repress the memory of rejection and transfer his love for a girl to a DDR machine.  Obviously, it's got a lot to do with DDR and dancing. So we're talking about how people will dance out their emotions or something in a comical fashion. And I ended up dancing around my room for like an hour. I was so hyper and happy and WOW, I feel optimistic.  In other news, I'M NOT TELLING. *raspberry*

      He apologized to me today.  He wrote me a note and signed it with his biological father's last name. He asked me to talk, and I didn't think I would until I saw the name.  He said stuff has happened. We didn't have much time. But I apologized and he apologized more. And he meant it. And we hugged. And I feel so much better about it now.  He's a different kind of friend. But I think maybe, considering the apology was given, without any asking from me, that he's not all bad. And maybe I could possibly consider forgiving and being his friend.  It's so weird. We just  talked and were actually honest and I realized how much I had missed him. Not necessarily in a romantic way. Just as himself. It's weird to lose a good friend.  Only problem, in the chance that we do become friends?  EVERYONE ELSE WE KNOW.........

      The "five questions" game-ish thing, to which I previously referred, goes like this. these questions are from Jen of Prepare to Meet Your Bakerina. Links are now abundant.  Here are the rules. I left her a comment. Anyone who wants to participate and has a blog or journal, leave me a comment, preferably with an email address. Although I understand if I'm too freaky and you just want me to comment on YOURS..... *sigh*   1 - Leave a comment, saying you want to be interviewed. 2 - I will respond; I'll ask you five questions. 3 - You'll update your journal with my five questions, and your five answers. 4 - You'll include this explanation. 5 - You'll ask other people five questions when they want to be interviewed.      1.  What is the funniest book you've ever read?   Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal SNogging,  et al. To commit the reductive fallacy, they are "teen" novels about a weird English girl. Sooooo addictive, and I laugh out loud while reading. I suggest them to anyone, because they're too good to be "tenn books"..... they're even funnier for the culture shock.     2.  Where in the world would you most like to visit?  WIlliamsburg, VA, right now. I want to go to college there but my parents don't like that idea, so I may never get to go.....    3.  Who is your favorite non-Simpson resident of Springfield?  Milhouse. The show would have no emotional drive without him. "I swear, I don't know how that scrunchie got in my hair!" ....... "I wish I was a free man. .,.... Oh, no! Puppy Goo-goo! MOM! Where's Puppy Goo-goo?" *recieves toy, cuddles* "Oh, Puppy Goo-goo, fetch me a dream!"   4.  What music do you play when you are feeling happy and/or optimistic?  Sheryl Crow,  C'mon, C'mon  album. "Soak up the Sun"...... Need I say more?   Actaully, this one is versatile. It expresses so many feelings, but always with this overtone of hope. I listen to it when I'm in a good mood, but also when I want to be in one......FYI, it's also great music for packing and unpacking suitcases.....    5.  What made you decide to study German?  FATE. or an accident, if you prefer...... I can't roll my R's, and I really hate the sound of Spanish, and my middle school had the choice of Spanish or German. I chose German, unlike all my friends. But it has been so worth it. I mean, I'll have done six years of it before college, because it just rocks. I love it and I thank god I didn't take anything else! I need to blog in German sometime.    5a.  Optional bonus question:  Have you ever seen the Wim Wenders movie Wings of Desire?  No, but now I think I'll have to. Does it involve German?   NOW GO COMMENT!

      Billions of apologies to Jen of  urlLink Prepare to Meet Your Bakerina.  I asked her to "interviewificate" me with the five questions game and accidentally emailed her from my spam email address! SO It's been almost a month since she sent me the questions and now I actually got them. Man, what a loser am I.  To make up for it, I shall now plug her site. It is something between a baking blog and a reggaler thoughts one. She is a smart kid and has really cool shoes.  urlLink So go visit it and tell her you think I suck.   Answers shall be posted tomorry.  Signing off, I am stupid. *circle-y finger salute*

      Forgot to mention that I ate kola nut today. One of the sacred foods of the Ibo people, this was used in many ceremonies and symbolized something in Chinua Achebe's  Things Fall Apart.    Fabulous, fabulous book. We're studying it in my IB LA/AP Lang-Comp class right now  However, it was incredibly yuck. Tasted like a potato covered in hairspray and anthrax.  Also, the girl who provided these morsels (who was doing a presentation on the symbology of food in the book) ordered them off the internet. So here I am, having eaten a frigging kola nut that came off the internet..... i mean, god knows who grew them, what kind of pesticides are on there.... they sure TASTED like pesticide.  And so then she tells us that the Ibo ate/eat a bit of it before each meal to help digestion.  I only took a small bite, but i did swallow. I mean, it's high school, fourth period, and our stomachs are eating themselves because we don't eat breakfast. But then I turn to the guy behind me, who probably ate about an entire half a kola nut, and said, "Is it weird that I can feel it digetsing in my stomach?"  And he's like, "Yeah, I can feel it too! My stomach's all like whew-whew-whew." *pantomimes squishing things with hands*  So yeah. I haven't felt sick yet, so it must have digested itself or whatever.  BUT can you imagine our entire IB class getting sick from (possibly) black-market African kola nuts someone bought off the internet?  We'd have a big IB nap-and-barf day. And maybe we'd get to miss math. Woot for that.

      I am one of those people who reads the Bill of Rights' "freedom of religion" as "freedom FROM religion."  However, today, i found myself procrastinating. Instead of turning into my neighborhood after school, i drove past it to a little shopping center. I wanted to go to CVS to replace some cool heart-shaped mardi gras beads i accidently threw away today (don't even ask). However, finding none, I wandered around the center.  I went first into a little consignment store. I've never been to one before, despite living here for the greater part of my life. I poked around and tried on three little black dresses. Two were size 8 and waaaay too big. One was a "size 2" and yet looked strangely small on me..... still, it was nice. The dressing room was pretty. It had one of those accordion-fold doors and star-shaped hanger things on the walls.  Then I walked all the way down, past a Hallmark owned by these weird uptight Indian people who have all these signs like, "children should not be let in here unsupervised" and stuff. I went past a closed bar and a pizza place and a camera store.   And then I went into a little store whose tagline was "religious books and gifts."  I don't know why I went in. I think just seeing it there all those years and boredom and the fact that I was (and still am) wearing a tiara for the beginning of Karneval, made me step in.  I actually got a little freaked out when I pushed open the door. And working in retail myself, I found it surprising that they didn't greet me when I came in. The lady was chatting to some customer.  I saw a bunch of books, for children, like "Gross and WEird Bible Stuff" and "Bible Weapons and Wars." I saw pamphlets about pornography and abortion. I saw books on prayer in marriage and YA fiction series about adventures and stuff. Books on "apologetics," which I now assume to be the art of justifying Christianity, or something. (It was like, Apologetics 2.5: YES, YOU SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE TRINITY: Speaking With Jehovah's Witnesses.) There were rosary beads in all colors and frames and little "TEEN CREED" things. There were little wallet-sized cards proclaiming the dangers of abortion and "Your Baby's Growth," with drawings of fetuses and stuff. There was one bookmarks with a picture of a little thing in a blob with some hands, and it said "Living X-old fetus from ectopis pregnancy." ANd on the back, "A person's a person, no matter how small. - Dr. Seuss"  So yeah. All these things that normally make me mad - I mean, I'm not married and not exactly virginal, and i'm pro-choice to the point of anger. And I don' know what the hell a rosary is, and I don't care about prayer or pictures of God or whatever.  I felt like an impostor, masquerading as a sweet little Christian, when I'm really just a heathen curious to see what the store's all about.  I'm not drawn to religion at all. It just seems tedious and meaningless to me. Which is why I haven't picked one.  But it was a nice, peaceful atmosphere. No God-Squadders shoving things in my face, blessing me, asking me if I'm saved. (Although there was a pamhplet on that last one.) I think if I was religious, I'd have a store like that where people can come to sit and read.   Although maybe not next to giant plastic Mary statues.

      My former OT once told me, "don't hide from yourself."  Funny that this was during the Epoch of Sadness following the Age of the Boyfriend. So i kinda hid from myself 24-7 there.  Unfortunately, it's happening again.  NUmber one - on Valentine's Day (VALENTINE'S DAY!) I received a call at ten-of-ten PM (on VALENTINE'S DAY!) from the Schnig. (Did i mention this was Valentine's Day?" Who wants to receive a call from an ex-bf on "VD," especially when they have recently discovered unpretty suspicions about said ex-bf are true, cementing a resolve to never again exist on civil terms with said ex-bf?)  (Not I.)  The conversation wasn't much. Here's the rundown. I answered it despite caller ID because I was afraid he would leave a message, adding to the twenty or so i already have of him that i'm afraid to delete bc I'll ahve to listen to him talking about how much he LOOOOOOVED me at 12:47 AM Saturday, August Blah. But to get to the interesting part....  Audrey: Hello. The Schnig: Hi. A: ..... who's this? TS: um..... it's [NAME]. A: ....oh. ..... hi. TS: Um. Is it, like, too late to call, or do you not want to talk to me, or.....? A: ..... ....... ...... I don't especially wanna talk to you. TS: *sighs* Ok. ......... well, bye. A: *hangs up*  Eu. Icy, I am. I refuse to say what all went down, but he deserves it from me... but anyways.  So all that funkiness notwithstanding (VALENTINE'S DAY?!?!?!?), a new problem has arisen.  In that I may have thought I had a crush on someone who turns out to like me a whole lot, where I don't think i reciprocate, and yet I cannot stop flirting with him.  If this is followable, without names, I do this a lot when single..... I generate small amounts of interest, flirt a little, and end up with guys who think they are in LURV and major guilt. I'm a repentant serial heartbreaker. Ask a friend....  So it's like the real, nice Audrey is hiding from the reality - that she may be leading someone to care about her. And that she doesn't REALLY "requite" this.   And she is hiding from the fact that she could probably stop it, if she would only face up.  But the real, nice Audrey is a wuss. Which is why I can be a "cold ice queen." * I let my id rule my superego and end up wondering why I suck.  * Great story..... he said something like, "Well, you can't just be a..... I'm sorry for saying this..... a.... cold ice queen! There, I said it, and I'm sorry for being so..... mean....."  and i believed his innocence and honesty.  NICE AUDREY, you are a sucker.

      I love to read bottles on beauty products. You know, the back, where they promise all kinds of stuff? It's too fun. Yesterday, a friend and I spent an hour at CVS buying all kinds of cool stuff (mousse, cheap red V-Day Mardi Gras style beads, brown hair shampoo, water flavored with SPLENDA, etc).  I think reading bottles of conditioner while treating your hair actually has a psychosomatic effect on its beauty. Which is why I am quite familiar with the Pantene Pro-V Treatise on Conditioner. It includes the  Six Signs of Healthy Hair:  1) silkiness 2) shine 3) less frizz 4) softness 5) strength 6) body  So, yeah. I mean, hey, they're the ones who devote their careers to making hair shiny, so why not listen?  However, I was just now reading a bottle of my brother's shampoo, which is VO5 Balsam & Protein, and it promises to restore the  Five Attributes of Healthy Hair:  1) Manageability 2) Shine 3) Softness 4) Bounce and Body 5) Strength  Compare and contrast, my friends. Compare and contrast.   I must now return that stuff to my brother's bathroom. But I think this shows that not all hair companies are the same. I mean, one seeks "silkiness" and "less frizz" while another wants "manageability" and "bounce." Totally different.  What the hell is balsam?

      Some of my friends tease me about being a "sex addict."  We decided jokingly to discuss the meaning of life on a school trip and I stated that if you look at it scientifically, the meaning of life is to create other life and perpetuate the species.  Dom: "....... so, you're saying the meaning of life is to have sex?"  And you can imagine the rest.  But i was reading Jitter's thoughts on it and i thought i might state my position on it for ya.  I think the meaning of life is different for us all - it's what you make of it. But for me, it's to be happy and impact the world in a good way. If i can make one person smile every day, I feel like i've done well.  So many of you go around, worrying about not being world-changing. But then your presence can have such an impact on others' worlds, and you don't even know it.   I was once pouring out my worries about being important or needed or whatever to the Schnig, and he told me that a friend of ours had at one time been so sad that she had been cutting herself. When he asked her why she had stopped, she said a lot of it was because of me. Just being happy to see her, greeting her, made her feel wanted.  It was so small, the things I did, but they made her life that much better. This made me feel that my life was not a waste. If i have helped one person to be happy, then I have not lived in vain.  So just know this. This is why I am nice, why I compliment people, why I laugh at stupid jokes teachers make, why I make an effort to be kind to everyone, to get to know people. I'm not sucking up, or being "social butterfly"-esque, or whatever. My two goals in life are to be happy, and to make others happy. Y'all dont' realize how the little things impact others. My friends don't realize that sometimes, just giving me a hug or something can make my day. They do it because they want to, and that's what makes it so special. They want me.  And so, I try to give out, to "pay forward," i guess, the care that people give me. Just remember how much you mean to the people around you, how much your seemingly little actions can do for the world. Don't hold back on telling your family or friends how much they mean to you, because that's often what they need most.  To be happy, we all have to take care of ourselves and each other. That is the meaning of my life.

      so i've been thinking about the whole "blogging phenomenon."  Millions and billions of people, all with blogs.  Publishing every little thought that creeps into their heads.  Hoping for someone across the world to read it and smile.  And leave a comment.  there are a few types out there. There are those really fabulously talented people who made it popular (see  tequila mockingbird, bellow , and  indiscretions ) and get read over and over daily. there are the ones who write down everything they had to eat and how many times their children pooped that day. there are the ones who use it as a place to post inside jokes and talk to their friends in asian baby slang ("it ish now jowk! I em not keedin, peepul reelee tock like dish online! azn_prYde for everyone!).... and then there are ppl like me, who aspire to be blog geniuses and so must refrain from ranting about food or whatever, unless it's interesting (to normal people).   and.... i had a point.... oh yes.  so. What got me here was how Julia of  TM  hasn't posted in a few days and is driving us all nuts. I was thinking, "what, did she die or something?"  and then i thought, "Oh. what if she DID die?"  What if someone who blogged a lot and was part of a big blog community died in an accident? I mean, none of their friends or family would know how to get into the blog and tell people they were dead. They probably wouldn't even know it existed, due to this whole anonymity thing. How weird would that be? Can't you just see the comments piling up and up....  and then what if one of their actual tangible peeps found it online, and read thru all of it?  It's kind of a theoretical reality check. Like, the internet can only go so far in connecting people. Ya know?

      In band, we're preparing for our Large Group Performance evaluation.  (It used to be called festival but apparently all the stupidly non-musically-inclined teachers at school got pissed because they thought were were missing school to go to a party.....)  The requirement is that each band plays three pieces. One is a march, one is a piece with movements, and one is just.... a piece. The teachers pick these from a list.  We are playing a massively fabulous piece called "Of Sailors and Whales" By W. Francis McBeth. It's got five movements, and they are all scenes from Melville's  MOby Dick.  It is mucho fun-o.   One of the best parts, in my opinion anyway, is that the third movement is almost all choral. Tubas, percussion, and low reeds play, and everyone else sings. It's some of the words from the ballad "Father Mapple's Hymn" and it's a tune that's similar to "Eternal Father, Strong to Save," which adds up to a mournful song baout a guy stuck in a whale praying.  However, I love to sing. LOOOOVE to sing. I may not be so good but I enjoy it. I did a little theater and a lot of band and I can belt it o-u-t when needed.  SO, we're going over it today in class with CT's dad, who's a chorus dude, and every time the "women" had to sing, CT would be like, "GO AUDREY!" and people kept smiling at me and stuff. I thought the sopranos were just really soft (i'm singing alto) compared to the guys, but when we got out of class, I was informed that I'm the only girl who can actually be heard. Apparently I sound pretty good, since there was no malice or anything. i actually got asked if I'd had training!   So there's a nice feather for my metaphorical AP Lang/Lit Hat. As one guy put it ,  I am "the only girl who has gonads."

      I have always been  sehr  annoyed by cards that refer to a person as "Valentine." For example: "Valentine, you set my heart aflutter!"  However, I've found a new annoyance.   What's  up  with the candy conversation hearts that say "Let's Read"? I was eating some the other day and I can't figure out what it means. Usually the phrases are like, "Call Me" or "Luv Ya" or something. Cheesy, to-the-point, cliched.  But "Let's Read?" Are teachers supposed to give them to the class or something?   Or maybe "read" is actually "R.E.A.D." and it stands for something mildly to severely suggestive. I don't know what it COULD stand for - but that's how these kids do it these days. The make up all those crazy words for *whispers*  "the sex."    Maybe it should have said "read my lips" or something like that, and the people who work in the factory are just illiterate.....   or maybe it's actually really beautiful and romantic and I'm just missing the point by making fun of candy for the sheer reason that I don't have anyone to give cheesy candy  to?   Nah.  I'm just glad they finally figured out just how a man can knock me off my feet. "Hey, baby, let's READ!"  (We shall ignore, for the moment, the fact that i had my first kiss in a bookstore.)  (ignore it......)  (oh, go.........   climb in a handbasket ............or something to that effect.)

      Have you ever stopped to think about how so many Americans use big words they don't understand?  First of all, I can guarantee that 50% or more of people who use the word "abstinence" all the time not only believe it to meaan "not having sex," but would also be clueless if you asked them to abstain from something.   And "platonic." God, how annoying is it when teens use that on TV or movies? Most people think it means "non-romantic." Many fewer understand the "non-sexual" part of it, and very few make the connection with Plato. A pencil-eraser's worth knows what Platonic forms are.  And.... "perverted." "Eeeeew, he's perverted."  I don't think that was ever supposed to be an adjective. "Perverted" means "sexually gross" to today's kinders. "To pervert" would be "to turn away from its natural state." But if you use any form of the stem around a middle-school-aged-or-younger crowd, you'd get giggles and junk...... The correct adjective is "perverse." But it just doesn't have the same sickening ring when squealed, now does it?........  And for a non-sexual example, "president." Everyone who's been to kindergarten, and many more, know who the President is. Yet, they cannot define the word "preside".......   Fifty-cent words for everyone!   "What, were you, like, raised by wolves?" "Yes, I was. Hmm."

      DO you remember that old SNL sketch with Lisa Kudrow? She did the talk show "Single and Lovin' It!" where all these single women were all "happy" and stuff. If I remember correctly -   Woman: SOmetimes I get really bored and lonely on Sundays. Other Woman: Oh, yeah, I know how you feel. (murmurs of agreement) Lisa: Oh, ok. Well, what I like to do is sit on my bed and draw myself into my favorite Cathy cartoons. (murmurs of appreciation) Other other woman: Um, I just want to say that I think that's really sad. Lisa: What? I'm single and Lovin' it!  and then the entire show deteriorates into needy women begging for men..... or soemthing to that effect.  ..... and...... point?...... oh yes.  SO I burned my very first CD today. Must be some rite of passage..... but I got a blank cd and used ti to make sure i could download onto and then burn cds on my computer. and i can! WOOHOO for that.  My plan is to take this playlist of "friend" songs i have and burn a CD to copy for all my girlfriends for valentine's day. Basically, I've got 2 friends who aren't single.... girls i mean. so yeah. i think it'll be good.  but then there's this leeeeeeetle voice in my head going "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE SEVENTEEN!!!! WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT DATING AT SEVENTEEN! THIS ISN'T HEALTHY!!!! YOU HAVE TO START DIETING BEFORE YOU DO THAT!!!!"  uuuuuuuuuuuuuuunh. I don't want to feel guy-less. I want him to notice me, dammit! alas, alack.  I went on a blind date a few nights ago. Well, my friend Vix persuaded me it was a blind just-friends but she meant it as a date. luckily, judging from both our reactions, we're off the hook as far as dating goes.   Why are there so few smart guys out there, and why don't they want to date me?  Playlist = soak up the sun, diamond road(sheryl crow); up from under, birdcage, baby bird (wallflowers); something to believe in (shawn mullins); answer, perfect girl (sarah mclachlan); everybody hurts (rem); and some other stuff. God, i don't remember. Whatever.  Much love.   And by that I mean Love, as in the Form. The Platonic form. Wait. Is all love striving to be Platonic "Love" or "platonic love"?  Damn Plato and his suspect sexuality.

      I would now like to explain in detail my foolproof cure for the hiccups.  While I was at GHP last summer, I got a severe case of them, and a girl I met was like, "I've got a cure!" Having often been advised to do realllllly weird things, i was skeptical, but she got me to try it. What you do is, fill a glass with water and drink from the opposite side. I don't mean, turn it around. I mean, basically you have nto have your chin inside the cup. It's awkward, but the slurping calms down the spasms of the diaphragm. The water probably shouldn't be too cold either.  This has worked excellently for me since then. It's awesome and also makes a funny story.  That being said, it ain't working now. Hopefully I won't end up like that guy who had them for like two years.  Anyone got a better cure for the hiccups?

      I came out of the bathroom stall and washed my hands in silence. My friend N stood next to me drying her hands.  I turn to her and say, "You know what? I'm a horrible mean bitch and I don't even understand why people want to be friends with me."  This would have been a lot more effective if  a) she hadn't gone on to ask me to repeat myself twice(loud hand dryers, ya know). b) I had said it to the person who deserves to hear me admit it.  I have been having a weird time of it. One of my good friends' birthday parties (J) was Saturday night, so I slept over there. Problem? J's mom and the Schnig's mom are bestest buddies. So naturally J's house is plastered with photos of the Schnig. Let me tell you, you have not felt awkward unless you have attempted to converse with someone standing near the refridgerator while keeping your eyes focused elsewhere...... especially when they probably know exactly what's up.  ANyway, the combination of these pictures and our Mexican dinner (coincidentally, at a former favorite date spot of ours - kill me now) gave me weird dreams. Something involving bicycles and helicopters and shopping (at a Target outlet for eyelash yarn and lampshade trim) and coffeeshops with tall stools that someone fell off of. And at some point the Schnig asked me if I would please go back out with him. This caused me to burst into tears (in my dream) and tell him I had to think about it. I felt as though I was being inexorably sucked back into the dead-end relationship and knew I shouldn't, but feared I would.  I woke up and was actually surprised to realize it had been a dream  ANyway, I guess this refueled my animosity towards him. Yesterday, sporting an Audrey Hepburn purse, I got many compliments, especially from people who understood the correlation. (MY NAME IS AUDREY, dumbbutt.) ANyway, one of "his" friends complimented it and he was like, "I don't get it." I surprised myself by saying icily, "Well, hon, that's cuz you're stupid." I swear it was supposed to be a joke.... but it didn't sound that way.  Let me add that he has also been hanging near me wayyyyyy too often. I don't want to be his friend and he seems to think I've gotten over that. (And obviously I don't get over things too well. Tee hee. Bawl.)  SO today I'm walking to the restroom and as I leave class, HE'S leaving his class! and he's in front of me. SOmething in me decided to walk brusquely around him (slowpoke lazy underachiever) and I expected nothing from him. But as I'm just getting him out of my sight, I hear him.  He ventured a "hi." In a little broken baby voice, like he was afraid and resolute but still hopeful.   And confused and scared to death, I barely turned my head, then flipped my hair and waked off shaking my head.  Let me clarify that there was no one else in the hall and that he knew I had heard him. How rude was that? How awful was that? How could  I  possibly put up with that from someone? How can I possibly continue hating him when he speaks to me like a child defeated?  Why does he try?  And the scary question - will he ever try again?

      My friend Vicky and I have this inside joke. She once told me this story, i think from SNL or something, in which someone specualted that if stupid people would only carry around signs stating their stupidity, people wouldn't waste time asking them for help or speaking to them or anything.  The example she gave was that of a truck driver who drove under a bridge that was too short and got stuck. He waved people down for help and they would ask him, "Oh, is your truck stuck under this bridge?"  He would reply, "No, I'm a Shriner. Heeeeeere's your sign!"  Essentially, when we give sarcastic answers, we end with that and giggles.  SO today I was perusing my "referral stats," which gives me the URLS of search engine pages, including queries. If anyone remembers the kola nut episode, which is linked at left, I talked a little about the book  Things Fall Apart.   Anyway, this one Googler came from the USA, I guess, and their query was: "Did Chinua Achebe's life affect Things Fall Apart?"  SOmeone out there is searching the internet for this. To this person, if you still read this site: OH. MY. GOD.   I'm not going to ask if you've ever heard his quote on the spear-shaking savages, or if you know where he lived, or where he was from, or if from his name you might have figured out his heritage. I'm not even going to say "No, of course a revolutionary book written about his native culture's tragic end was not at ALL affected by his life. It was a coincidence. If he hadn't got to it first, Danielle Steele would have," with a mean ironic inflection.  I'm just going to say:  No, his death affected it. Heeere's your sign.

      I just want you all to know how wonderful American schools are.   Now, in all seriousness, getting an International Baccalaureate education with AP credit is HOT HOT HOT!   However, it's not the gifted kids that set the school's standards.  You see, darling Bushie-Wushie decided that no child would be left behind in terms of education.   This is a nice policy, i guess. Make sure everyone is educated, blah blah blah. I mean, it was crappy when in fifth grade students couldn't even read properly bc teachers were sooooo lenient with them.  But do those of us who care about what we're doing in school, really ever need to be exposed to the mundane stuff? I mean, I would hope that having passed all my hard-ass classes I would be prepared to graduate. But no, Georgia like to do this "high school graduation test" - a big standardized test on math, soc stud, science, and LA - and if u don't pass it you don't graduate.  This is also a great idea. I totally agree with the concept.  But OH MY GOD. The things they consider testable knowledge, learned in school, at a high school level? ANd the fact that people fail this stuff? That just fills my heart with dread for the future of our great nation.  We've only had science and social studies so far, but here's some stuff i saw that was memorable. I'm typing a few from memory and a few off of a study guide i was given....  1) A chemist drops a beaker holding unknown chemicals onto the floor and it breaks. Which of the following is    NOT    part of the correct safety procedure for cleaning this up? a) Use tongs to move the glass shards. b) Wash hands after cleaning. c) Do not rinse chemicals down drain. d) Carefully pick up the glass shards with your fingers and deposit them in the nearest trash can. PROBABLY GEORGIAN ANSWER: B. We too deep for chemical burns.  2) Which of the following is    NOT    a responsibility of a U.S. citizen? a) vote in elections b) talk other people into agreeing with your point of view c) obey the law PROBABLE GEORGIAN ANSWER: A.  "Evolution: don't let it happen to you."  3) The Senate campaign in Jane's state has become very controversial. The chanllanger, John Jones, has accused the incumbent, Harry Havelock, of being unconcerned about an issue. Where should Jane go to  find out how Mr. Havelock really feels about these issues? a) the encyclopedia b) her parents c) the COngressional Record d) her social studies textbook a) vote in elections PROBABLE GEORGIAN ANSWER: B. Mostly Republican, huh?  Enh.... i don't wanna think any more.....

      In preschool, there was a little chart under the bulletin board with the days of the week. It started with Monday. Each one was a different-colored pocket, with a white square that had the day printed in black letters. You were supposed to move the paper that said "today" on each day.  I still remember each color. Monday was blue, a dark blue that i today learned is known as "Klein blue" after a guy who patented the color. Tuesday was orange, Wednesday was green, Thursday was a dark red-burgundy-red, and Friday was yellow. Saturday and Sunday were light purple and pink, I think, but we didn't have school on those days, so they weren't so important, since you didn't get that cool job of moving the paper.  To this day, I associate each day of the five-day school week with that color. We make plans for Tuesday and I envision orange. Etc, etc. Weird, huh?

      i just discovered those little page counter thingies.  See, i've had one, which is nice, for about ..... 460 people. But i just realized if you go into the thingy, it shows you where peopel got referrals, and how they found me on search engines and stuff.  It was kinda freaky bc last night, one of the addresses was a Google search, with a query about "pictures of naked little boys doing" something I don't especially want to type on the internet. Sure, I'm a publicity whore, but i don't want THAT kind of publicity. (please don't lead them back to my page now.)  However, my Simpsons love has helped a bunch, since the biggest searches were stuff like "puppy," "goo," and "milhouse."  OH NO. I just realized i no longer have the link to REJECTED. Ahhhhhhhhh.  Homework? Psh. Pssssssssssssssssssh. High school kids don't do WORK on the weekends, especially a 4-day weekend! Especially when we feel like losers and stuff like that. No, we blog and im each other and ingest caffeine.  I think I'll go mess with my new bangses. Have a charmed evening.

      B - the new name for the ex-bf, taking into account a few events that you shall never hear of - and I are american teens, if you didn't get that already. We dated for a year and a half. We were mad mad mad mad madly in love. We were best friends, and more, and soooo happy.   It's funny how double dates tend to highlight stuff in different couples. Like when Vicky and her bf of 2 years, and my blind date and I, went out together...... it was weird because they're so comfortable, while we we afraid to touch elbows. Stuff like that.  You see, it was a strange but great coincidence how my best friend and his best friend - we'll call them Boy and Girl - began dating a few days after us. Naturally, we double-dated all the time. Our relationships moved at the same rate and it was just nice - you get to spend the day with three of your best friends, one of which is the person you LURV.  Just, ya know, fun. Innocent, first-love excursions, holding hands in the mall or sitting on each others' laps at a coffee shop. The four of us, in our clearly-defined couples. So cute, so sweet.  Now, while Boy was much shorter than Girl, B and I fit that old "girl-should-be-smaller" standard. But not in a funny way, like Nixie and Timmy, who are 5'0" and 6'3", respectively.  So which couple got the stares? Which couple got looks ranging from amusement to disapproval every time they went out? Which couple wouldn't have been identified as a couple but for the linked arms? Which couple was just "wrong?"  I guess the little stuff does matter. Stuff like how I'm white, and B is black. Ya know. Just that.  It's weird for me, having been a sheltered white girl, raised without any trace of racism, how it works. How people I don't even know can look at me, standing with someone I love more than anything in the world, and tell me with their gaze that we're not right, that I can't love him, that it's unnatural, that it sickens them, that I'm being stupid and deviant and that I'm WRONG.   If you've never been there, thank someone.  Funny how that translates. How my thinking about this, my first actual encounters with prejudice, somehow led to that ongoing question everyone faces - "is it okay for people to be gay?"  And suddenly, I thought, "I'm not gay. It's none of my business whom they love, because it doesn't affect me at all. How could I ever turn around and say that people couldn't be in love after knowing how that feels?"  I realy wish all the stupid uptight prejudiced cowards of America would just take a friggin' step back and look at themselves. Thank God that you're not homosexual, because we will never have to live the life they do. We will never have to struggle for  the right to love someone.  We will be able to marry the people we love. We will not get those stares everywhere we go. We will not live our lives set apart from so many others who are too afraid of opening their minds to try and care about another human being.  What kind of world is this, that I have to be thankful not to be in a minority? WHat the hell kind of world are we creating for the future? There's no way I'm having children. I'm not bringing a child into a world that's so full of hate it outlaws  marriage.    My God, people! Live and let live! Not everyone lives by your religious rules!  WHatever happened to "majority rules WITH MINORITY RIGHTS"? Whatever happened to a man and woman being the same in the eyes of the law? Pursuit of happiness? Not infringing needlessly on others' rights, maybe? I dunno.  U.S.A.?  That's funny, I thought this was the United  Christians  of America. But hey, since the majority doesn't want to let gay people get married, gays obviously don't matter. Who cares if we're barring people from living the happy lives they deserve?  Some people think it's gross!   YOU KNOW WHAT'S GROSS? HOW MUCH AMERICANS SUCK. We act like "Oh, we love everyone, oh, we're so free and open here, and we all have our rights, blah blah blah" and then we turn around and complete ignore people. What a shitty era. God, I hate hate. I hate hate. I hate hate.  Nice country, where people are free to live and love and speak and work and learn and worship the way they want.   Maybe someday I'll get to live there.

      So we finished our Freud movie. It rocks really hard.   We thought it was going to SUCK because not only did the actors hold scripts a lot, we filmed it two days b4 it was due.  Then the deadline got pushed forward a day, so we had more time.  Then we discovered that there wasn't any of our recorded sound that couild be heard.  Then we came up with the idea of subtitling and using mood music.  SO basically, it's got awesome music (Gary Jules' cover of "Mad World," REM's "Endgame", and a really cool techno remix of the "I Dream of Jeannie" theme) and then these cool subtitles, which make sup for the stumbling actors. IT really looks good. I'm excited beyond your mom's pocketbook, or something to that effect.  I think it'll change the way one or two ppl think about neuroses. I also think it'll make a high school Theory of Knowledge class fall out of their chairs with its comic genius.  Woot for history!

      * denotes sarcasm.  Uhhh, I hate him. I hate him. I hate him. I hate him. He is a jerk a jerk a jerk a jerk a jerk.  If anyone wants to hate him with me, go right ahead. We can make a chant or t-shirts or maybe you can buy me ice cream.  On another crappy note, despite my request, I have somehow been scheduled to work on prom night. And if they don't fix it, i am going to break something. And I would like very much if it were that stupid boy.

      If you've ever played in a band/wind ensemble/symphony, go find a recording of The Children's March by Percy Grainger. Grainger is the rockin'est weird genius musician ever, and this song ROCKETH. (Horn dominance, anyone?)  I might could attempt to post the recording of the piece HERE, but i tend to hate that, altho that usually results from crappy midi files..... i'll look into something that doesn't violate copyrights.  AND if you've ever taken Zoloft, or know someone who has, and had odd moody side effects from it OF ANY SORT, or you just happen to know a whole lot about it, please leave a comment with ur story..... i am trying to find out something and yeah, ease my nerves here.

      The Schnig came over today after school. Neither of us had anything to do and he wanted to escape his house, so we thought we'd watch some tv and just "chill."  SO he came over and we sat on my porch for a few minutes and talked about postmodernism and silly things. And then we decided to watch TV. And we went to the basement for some reason, and not the one upstairs where other people were.  And see, whenever i make up romance stories in my head, they're  überromantic . And my favorite movie-scene kiss is the one that's totally unplanned, the first kiss between two friends who are just talking or fighting or something, where they don't even know what happens. Like they're just sitting there and suddenly they're against each other and they don't even care how.  But then it's kind of funny. Because i went down the stairs first and when we got to the bottom i think i must have turned around somehow, talking about some TV show, and was standing in his way, but we just looked at each other and he didn't stop walking and i felt my mouth drop open and he groaned.   And then his arms were all around me and my hands were on his back and everything else was gone. And it's like this sense of urgency, but also this familiarity. And it's so perfect and sexy and sweet and there's so much to feel.  And then we pull apart and somehow we're not standing up any more, we're lying on the couch and both of us are shaking. And we lay together for a moment, not listening to the TV at all. And he kissed my hair and i was close enough to count his freckles again, and he's crying a little and I can't make him stop. And you want him to stop so desperately because you want this to be a happy movie and you might start too if he doesn't.  But it doesn't matter how much you comfort. And just like before, we talked again and cried again because our parents don't like it, and our friends want to kill us if we mention the other's name, and we're right back to where it left off all those times before.  In the movies, he never leaves after a perfect kiss like that. And you don't ball up on the couch and sniffle because it still smells like him when you wrap yourself in the blanket. Because even as you both apologize, you know you would give anything to hold each other for another five seconds. And in the movies, if he whispered "Just one more time," even as he's apologizing and pulling himself away, you would have one more time and a million more besides. You wouldn't soak his shirt with tears because you know that it's never the last time, that the last time is already through, and that you'll never be this close to it again.  And you wouldn't ever ever cry because you don't know if it's worse that it happened, or that it had to stop.

      ....... i have discovered the best product EVER.  It is called Coppertone Endless Summer Sunless Tanning Foam.  I am looking good.  I recommend, my friends. I recommend.  I think my "medium/dark" tan makes me feel more robust and rugged. Why, I flirted with the guy at the ice cream place we went ot after the movies, and when i got home I ate a steak  without utensils.    That's right - eatin' with the fingers, baby.  I should do commercials for them.

      My LA teacher made some joke about how when we read Gatbsy this past week, and didn't HAVE to read it from a scholarly view (for once - cue "Hallelujah" chorus), we would still feel like annotating.  [Ahem, those of you who grew up in the "everyone's-not-special" generation, ANNOTATION means writing in the book. You write what you think and underline stuff. This is not "Oh no, I hope they don't go under the bridge!" This is "Foreshadowing?" or "Periodic sentence" or "irony." I sometimes write "Ouch!" or "Haha!" but I odn't show my teachers.....]  I underlined stuff to avoid being pointed at and laughed by this woman, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the book!  However, it was weird, because on our plane ride home(yes, I was gone, losers who didn't notice or miss me) I'm reading the last part - for those who've read it, it was about the time Wilson and Nick left their respective residences - and my dad suddenly leans over and asks, "What are you writing?"  He leaned over to try and read it like I was a little girl writing in a diary and snickering at him. it was kind of weird, considering he's mass-educated, but then I think this whole annotation thing must relatively new, considering the amount of used books you can find that aren't all pencil-y.  I'm sure I sounded like quite the disgruntled teen, but I whined, "Dad, I'm  annotating!"    And because I thought my annotation here was stupid - it was like, "is it dead?" and generally my hope on that subject is rejected by superior Southern-Baptist lit experts - I  actually covered it up with my hand.   Like a little girl writing in a diary, guilty and embarrassed!  I don't think this says that annotation is part of that whole reader-response theory, that the reader puts a huge personal thingy in their reading, and maybe doesn't want to share, or anything profound like that.   What it says is that I'm a nerd.

      [i'm going to nitpick for a minute here.]  You know that phrase that goes.... "Shoot for the moon. Even if you don't make it, you will land among the stars!"...?  Well, ever since I first heard this phrase, I have believed it to be crap.   This is not because it is cheesy - cheesy stuff can be sweet and kitschy.  It is crap, simply because the moon is closer to you than the stars. So it makes absolutely no sense that aiming for a short distance, and running out of fuel, will get you a long distance.  The moon is, like, the closest celestial body to the Earth, which means it ain't the hardest thing out there. Metaphorically, it suggests normal success, like pushing paper, not being in debt, having kids, buying a house on mortgage, etc.  The stars, on the other hand, are pretty freaking far away. So getting to the stars would be like finding a cure for AIDS, or being poet laureate, or being the world's first biracial hermaphroditic one-legged lawyer.  *note to self - must submit ideas to SNL for review.*  So that statement is saying something like, "Try to learn to use a calculator. Even if you fail, you will still have that knowledge of calculus" or "Apply for a job at McDonald's. Even if you are rejected, you can always fall back on that degree in psychology."  It should be, "Shoot for ..."  You know what? I can't think of any intelligent way to rephrase that. I just think it'd be funny if school counselors said "Shoot yourself!"  and..... uhhh....

      Having discovered that i WASN'T crazy, and  urlLink goliard  actually changed links, i finally had to do some cleaning up of the links list. I had left some "dead" ones up in the hopes that they would update that nifty bloglinker thing, but alas, they have probably been lost.  people don't live forever, and we often get bored with our activities. So some of those great-blogs-that-i-don't-read-daily-but-are-still-good-reading are going to be seriously missed.  SO, the first installment of the informal obituaries, as best I can remember.....  ORFINANNY AND AUSTIN http://orfinanny.blogdrive.com  This writer guy, Austin, had this cool thing going where he invented the "perfect" woman, Orfinanny, and they supposedly wrote a blog together. Lots o' political stuff, and lots o' humor. Woe, woe, woe to the dead duo. I can only assume that one of the guys who envied Orfie killed Austin off and they ran away to St. Bart's.  STRATFORD-UPON-AVON: THE TRUTH http://atowngoesdown.blogspot.com  This other guy, he lives(d?!?!?) in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, which is that place where that writer guy (not Austin) wurde geboren. So, he had some neat observations about life in the famous place. And also some neat observations on life in general. Some tourist probably shot him or something. It may very well have been my English teacher.  A DAY IN THE LIFE http://adayinthelifeat.blogspot.com  Ok, I didn't read this that often, but it was cool because this lady linked to me early on and I was flattered that someone read me. She had survived cancer and wrote cool stuff about her life - just not necessarily that humorous. Still, twas good. I have no idea how she "died" - I seriously hope it wasn't cancer. Probably just bored from reading about MY life.  shit. I can't remember who else died. Seems like there were more....  Well, uhh, just remember this, bloggers:              Do not ask for whom the bell tolls - it tolls for thee.   (And if you didn't figure out which writer guy was born in STratford-upon-Avon, you either a) got confused by my German or b) are an idiot who shouldn't be allowed to speak English.)

      I've become a "damn" liberal.  You see, when i'm driving to school in the morning, i enjoy listening to the Don Miller Morning Show, which is on my local alternative/rock station, 99X. (Yay, atl.) They are pretty controversial because they are frank and not at all PC, but still muy funny. And if people would only a) understand sarcasm and b) use moderation, there'd be no problem at all. For the record, there is no "Don Miller," and they explained that a long time ago. They made up a random name for humor.  Now, last week a great controversy erupted because some guy on the show commented that he found it annoying when people on bicycles rode in the middle of the street at slow paces and wouldn't allow cars to pass them. Some "cyclist" took this the wrong way and suddenly all the cycling nubs of Atlanta were on the show's case, writing these great letters about how people were always persecuting them, comparing their plight to that of blacks, and threatening all kinds of crap.   Normally, I really enjoy stuff like that because honestly, there are a lot of idiots in Atlanta and you couldn't make that kind of comedy up if you tried. But this morning, they read a letter from a pissy conservative who brought in a whole bunch of trite things about Bushie-wushie. And this guy actually wrote a letter to the FCC about how 99X was spewing "liberal Anti-American propaganda."  You see, it's all fine and good to support Bush, because i know, love, and respect plenty of people who do. It's your fucking right. I'm okay with that. It's America.  But it just downright PISSES ME OFF when people claim that NOT supporting him is "anti-American." That somehow, THEY have the right to support their own beliefs, but IIII do not. Like, it's only patriotic to agree with the government.  Uh, yeah, in Cuba.  I hate very much that such a small percentage of Republicans I know are actually reasonable when it comes to politics. How, when you look at the nation, it's not really that many that are unreasonable anyway. How a percentage of IDIOTS ruin their whole thing, and say shit in the name of their party.  BUT i hate even more that they get away with it.  So, in a small bout of retaliation, I am going to deconstruct this idiot's letter. I don't know where to start on his beliefs, so we'll just hold our noses high as we observe his shitty grammar. My comments are   BOLD.   Enjoy.   OFFENSIVE MATERIAL ON WNNX   Good day gentleman.  I think he's writing to more than one guy, and needs a comma after his introductory phrase.   Of course, you may not have good days much longer, thanks to your lack of respect for our President and the FCC.  That syntax is just gross. If I agreed, i might rephrase it for him.  Just so you know what was said, I've attached the message I sent to the FCC last Friday about your show. I guy work with said Jimmy claimed to make $300K a year.  Nice grammar, buddy.  That's great, because it will only take him a few years to pay off his portion of the fine. You other two might have a little more trouble.  I tuned this morning  oh, he must be a musician  just long enough to hear that you're having America hater  should be hyphenated  Bill Marr on your show tomorrow. The same Bill Marr who said the 9/11 terrorists were heroes and we are the cowards.  Nice fragment.  Unless you want another complaint to the FCC, I suggest you either cancel the interview, or at least do everything in your power to make him understand how wrong he is. I will be monitoring your show tomorrow to make sure your don't allow any more indecent material on the air.  In your sick twisted minds,  commas, anyone?  you probably think what you did was alright and that I'm a jerk. Well if you had kids your attitude would be totally different.  commas after introduction and subjunctive.   -Josh  ANyone else like how he started off formally and ended with a dash?   Honorable Chairman Powell,  Suck up more, please. Oh, wait, that's not grammar. Oh well - he's still being dumb.    I am sending you this email in regard to inform you  WHAT? What are you, retarded? What kind of affected and grammatically incorrect phrase is that?  that some very offensive material was aired over public radio in Atlanta recently. On Thursday May 6  welcome to writing dates correctly  at about 9:00 AM, the "Don Miller Morning Show" on WNNX 99.7 FM allowed an anti-American, liberal so-called comedian named David Cross to come on their show and talk at length about how the current war for Iraqi freedom is bad, and how our esteemed commander-in-chief, George W. Bush, is terrible.  "Big word big word big word big word.... uhh... bad."   The Don Miller Morning show allowed this David Cross character  sounds like an old West sheriff  several minutes to spew liberal anti-American lies and propaganda.  I love the diction of vomit here - it's so creative! "spewing propaganda" - whoever heard of such a great use of imagery and metaphor? Bravo!  They did not try to counter his arguments or shut him down. Many of the cast members even vocally agreed with several of his "points".  punctuation inside the quotes  He cast dispersions on our President,  Does anyone else know what the hell he means by "casting dispersions?" ... maybe he thought the big word would scare us.   questioned his intelligence, and even had the gall  oooh.... brain cramp  to question our  whose? are YOU part of the war?  motivations for the war for Iraqi freedom. All of this was said over public airwaves and could be heard by impressionable children. I think everyone agrees that freedom of speech is important, but their are limits, especially when children could be given the wrong idea about our leaders and our country.  Well, that's debateable, but I think we can all agree that children should never be allowed to think freely.   In addition, while corresponding with the Don Miller Morning Show by email over this matter, I was called several unmentionable names and my intelligence was derided.  Again... does anyone know what "deriding intelligence" is?  One of the members of the show, "Jimmy Baron",   comma inside the quotes  who has admitted on air to being Jewish,  admitted? What, is it embarrassing? even took the name of Jesus in vain.  Well, God forbid a BUSINESS should allow other religious beliefs!   According to their website, the members of the Don Miller Morning show are: Fred "Toucher" (the head), Jimmy Baron, Wally (last name unknown), Leslie Framm, "Crash" and "Calandro" .  punctuation inside the quotes!  For your record, their is no "Don Miller".  first of all, learn to spell "there." and for God's sake, PUT THE F*CKING PUNCTUATION MARKS INSIDE THE QUOTATION MARKS!  I have only had correspondence with the first three on this list, and I can only assume that most or even all of the show members are using fake "show-biz" names.  Thank for the attention I know you will give this matter,  thank WHO?  and thank you for the fine job you are doing in cleaning up America's airwaves.  Your Fellow Patriot, Josh   Sucking up.... and if he thinks Colin Powell is as stupid as him, he should be shot to prevent his genes from tainting the rest of humanity.     He also misspelled Leslie Fram's name, and he probably doesn't even know what "FCC" stands for, as he neglected to use its full name of this government institution in "formal" letters.  Moral of the story - don't write rude letters unless you write them WELL.  (taken from  urlLink the 99x website. )

      rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  I just stumbled across  urlLink this  lovely website.   Basically, it's some conservative in Cali bitching about how liberals are trying to take over the world by persuading people. Or something.  But since it's annoying to have people write negative shit on ur blog, i'll do it all here....   "Like most Americans I was stunned. It was a body blow," said Rumsfeld, who has been fending off calls for his resignation over a crisis threatening President Bush's bid for a second term in November elections.  Some analysts say they are even wondering whether the photographs of prisoners being abused will have the same effect as television pictures of the Vietnam War which eventually turned many Americans against it."   Apparently this is liberal bias because it might persuade someone not to agree with the war, and because the more gruesome pictures of what THEY did to US aren't shown, people don't get persuaded by them, or something.  1) Uhh, obviously there are standards? The fact that "tha Ay-rabs" may have committed worse things, that violate censors' standards for putting pictures in the public domain? (even though we easily get them online anyway.)  2) You see, apparently we are all SO mindless that seeing pictures of torture, next to explanations of how it wasn't the whole army, will make those of us who love and admire Bushie-wushie STOP loving him. Since, ya know, we don't think for ourselves or anything.   Come on... people who actually LIKE bush are soooo in love with him that they simply scream "propaganda!" and ignore it. People who a) don't care or b) hate the man, just get more evidence on why he sucketh.  3) "Well, ok, somaybewemighthavedoneabadthing  BUT we're NOT AS BAD as  THEM!"   is getting to be a very annoying mantra. Dude, we  know  they do bad stuff too.   But come on..... aren't the conservatives the ones who are anti-abortion? ya know, "it's your choice! don't have sex bc someone tells you to! if everyone jumped off a bridge, would you?"   so what's up with this sudden "but MO-OM, everyone ELSE'S government lets them break the geneva conventions! it's not fair!"  4) God.... the fact that someone actually sits around and infers "bias" from news articles so he can bash liberals. Man. We worry about hatred from stuff like racism, sexism, religion..... and right here at home, we have people like this. People who can't even see around the politically-rigid glasses they've built themselves into, who hate people who disagree with them so much that they build websites about it.   The sun is setting....  5)Whoever wrote the article this guy spoke to, used an unclear pronoun reference that makes my head hurt. So basically, you both annoy me.  Uhh, have a nice day.   (And by that, of course, I must mean "kill a Republican.")

      and it was GOOOOD.  However, for those of you who don't know, I wear my hair long and straight, with long bangs at the front which i can part and push over or whatever... It is extrememly similar to recent haircuts of  urlLink Britney Spears  (blech) and  urlLink Lindsay Lohan  (woohoo!), who stars in the movie.  Anyway, so i'm admiring how LL's hair was fixed in this movie, which was all about NOT being superficial, and realize that mine have grown out a lot again. I was going to trim them just before prom, but held off in case of hairstyle problems, and they were just..... everywhere.  So i came home and, having learned my lesson about appearances, cut my bangs.  They are now too short and make me look something like  urlLink this  unfortunate girl, although they are past my eyebrows...  But hey, at least now my lesson comes into use.... i hope.

      my toes are dark red, and that's weird. I had prom last week and went for the boring, regular toenail color. I really really want to change it to orange, but doing so would ruin my fabulous french manicure.  We took a trolley to prom. It was awesome, since we had a group of about 18 people. The trolley was wood and pretty old and kind of falling apart, but it was cheap and it was FUN. It had one of those cool dingy bell things and we got to ride out on the back of it and wave at people who were wondering why all these teenagers were dressed up and riding on a trolley.  My hair was biiiiiiiig. And I had an awesome date who is a good friend of mine. And i looked great. And I had fun dancing with people and it was just awesome.  But I realllllllly reallllllllly missed him, him, HIM, a lot. Especially since he didn't even go. And because it felt weird to dance with someone else. And because I bought that dress for his-and-my "future" prom a long time ago. And while my friends are bodacious, I think I'm still sad, especially in light of the past month's events.   And then he saw my pictures and didn't even tell me I looked pretty.  If you really want to know.

      On Saturday, I babysat at a party. There was one family there, two parents and one child. The dad had a name like Martin or something, but the mom's name was Cinnamon. The I met their daughter and found out her name was Cayenne.  At Music Midtown, I kept seeing this couple walking around. The woman was very short and dressed modestly, in a T-shirt and long shorts, but had a shaved peach-fuzzy head. Her boyfriend/husband was very tall (Tim and shaved Allie, anyone?) and wore no shirt, but had a green camo cowboy hat on. As they walked, he was absentmindedly rubbing her bald head.  And this is the best...... Lit/Lang students, chew on this.  A week or so ago, I was on my break at work and was sitting outside the cookie place doing HW. Two little girls walked by, and they were about 8/9/10 years old. One was wearing a hot-pink spaghetti-strap top and a more modest little girls' version of those fluttery skirts you see these days, made of denim, and heeled sandals. Her friend wore a big blue t-shirt and big shorts and flip-flops.     As they passed KB Toys, which closed recently, the one in blue stopped and peered into the window. Her friend, annoyed, called her to come on.

      shamelessly ctrl-c-ctrl-v'd from  urlLink And another thing...    A meme   I want everyone who reads this to ask me 3 questions, no more no less. Ask me anything you want and I will answer it. Then, I want you to go to your journal, copy and paste this allowing your friends (including myself) to ask you anything.   My question now is, or are, a) will you accept?    and b) Is "meme" Canadian for "memo"?

      The Schnig. Henceforth, I think I shall call him "B," for reasons I ought not to divulge.  ANyone who's read maybe one-third of my entries on this page know who this guy is. On-again-off-again boyfriend, best friend, worst enemy, future husband, support system. We have an odd relationship, but it's one of the strongest bonds in either of our lives. Current status = LURVE him to death, except for his ideology....  See, he was raised kinda-sorta in a  urlLink religious cult . The Way International? Yeah. I mean,  urlLink this (Christian) ministry  has good religious habits, and they've done a lOT of research that's pretty damn important in the Christian world, but most people in it are also weird.   He lived for two years on a ministry communal farm thing.  However, since his mother's divorce of a "Ministry man," and the implied shunning from so many of those people, their family pretty much can't stand the Way any more, so they just worship outside of it.   ANyway, he's got a very strong background in Christianity, and a freakish amount of historical knowledge stored in his brain. I'm talking, this is that freshman who tested out of AP history classes. This is the guy I use when I'm writing papers and studying for history classes. He just RETAINS it. So, of course, he has all kinds of religious history committed to memory.  He doesn't walk around talking about it, and most people don't even know his religion because he's very laid-backa bout his faith, but in truth, he's Christian through and through.  Being agnostic myself, there are a few issues we just will never ever agree on, ever. One of these is homosexuality. B is all, "Homos homos homos, gross gross gross, Bible Bible Bible." I'm all "SYmpathy sympathy sympathy, humanism humaism humanism, rights rights rights." It doesn't work. At any rate, one of his endearing nicknames is "my little homophobe," which is actually pretty dysfunctional, but it still makes me laugh.  So a few nights ago we were talking on the phone and at some point he remarked that he couldn't think of anything worse than having to watch two men have sex. Sick of his "gay" problems, I pointed out that there were much worse things to watch. When asked for an example, I brought in a disgusting comment made by one of our other wall-humping male teenage friends earlier in the day, and suggested bestiality. He denied it.  Basically, I'd rather watch gay people have sex than a person and a horse, and he's rather see the other.   I'm not so sure why this is relevant to anything, except that it reminds me of the "Bush or Kerry?" question..... pick between two undesirable things?  Now, unless you're both gay AND bestial, this is probably somewhat YUCK for you..... still, I'd like to play this age-old game and ask, what would YOU rather watch, is you had to watch one? (The sex, not the Presidents.)

      I'd just like to point out that, being in the middle of P.E., I have not learned a lot about lifetime fitness. I have learned WHY you need to be fit and HOW to do it. However, I still abhor exercise. I hate sweating and hurting and wasting a fucking hour of my life walking and not going anywhere!   You'd think they'd have figured out that the reason some people don't exercise is because they HATE it, and maybe try to fix that. But instead of the great teachers who show you their subject don't suck, they instead drill you with facts and give you the most boring and horrendous schedules to follow. I'm amazed at how something so incredibly NOT INTERESTING can still be so ouchy.  Is it really healthy for me to walk for an hour a day in my target zone? I mean, a whole fucking consecutive hour? I truly doubt that's a good idea, unless you're into pain and injury and fatigue. I was fine when the workouts were only half an hour - I felt GOOD then. That was GOOD pain. Now, it just hurts because the only way I can finish the wokrout is to push myself so hard it hurts beyond any fathomable promise of benefit.  Now I feel this mundane, endless task ahead of me every day. It's five-o-fucking-clock and I can't make myself do it. I just don't fucking want to exercise right now. I've had a tiring day and I need a nap, not an hour of hell.   I have to go walk in el THRZ-o for an hour and then do pushups and shit. Pushups? I love pushups. I eat those for breakfast.  I'm even fine with walking, even for an hour, except i have to walk within my target zone for an hour. This doesn't include the time you spend warming up, cooling down, and resting from overexertion, not to mention taking a sip of water and hearing the fucking heart rate monitor beep and tell you to work harder, bitch. No nutrients for you.  This leads to pain and cramping and soreness and for some reason, it's incredibly fucking DIFFICULT to get into the target zone for me lately, even when i'm feeling motivated. Maybe because I'm so pissed off. So I work harder and harder and I already absolutely fucking hate this course and I'm barely halfway done.  My soul is all shrively and gross. And my legs hurt, too.  It's people like Miss Biological Changes Over Time that consider this an important part of my education. [Put down the hairspray, lady. Actually, pick it back up and stop coming to work.] I KNOW people are getting obese and stressed out and shit, but i certainly don't think overexhaustion is a good alternative. If this thing were only a bit less ridiculous, I'd be just fine. But I cannot possibly live through two more weeks of hour-long pain sessions.  As much as I try not to hate things without good reason, I HATE P.E. If this course was a person, I would push them off a building and make it look like an accident.

      My brother is currently at Boy Scout Camp. That's where the Boy Scouts go and be gross for a week. They work hard, sleep too little, live in the boonies, and eat disgusting food.  So my dad's telling us about dropping him off, and talking about the counselors and stuff, and mentioned "she."  I did a double take (well, not really, but wouldn't that look nice in a restaurant?) and was like, "there are FEMALE counselors there?" My father snorted and affirmed this.  They don't allow GAY MEN to work in the Boy Scouts, but WOMEN are okay.  Say WHAAAAAAAAAT?  I'm completely confused. I mean, I thought people were justifying this whole anti-gay-scouting* thing by saying that gay men would either rape the children or display something less than the masculinity desired by the boys.  So in light of that new stuff..... I'm sorry, but how the hell can someone rationalize this? Are they saying women are incapable of raping people? Or that women - actual FEMALES who are actually feminine (and I mean this in the most un-loaded of ways....) - are better suited to teach masculine values than men? Actual masculine(again, the most un-loaded of ways) men, with penises and th4e ability to grow facial hair?  I'm pretty sure anyone can rape ANYONE. At least, that's what they told us in Health class, and those "my body's nobody's body but mine"-type videos.   And by "masculine" and "feminine," I mean "of a man" and "of a woman." Not "rugged and musky" and "flowery and delicate." I read the essay on the English language - I know when to be careful.  But how are they pulling THIS off? Are gay men just evil, evil people or something? Are they just going to come out and SAY that they hate gay people? I mean, it's about time SOMEONE was honest about it.  More likely, they'll continue to rationalize it.    *In the meantime, I think the Gay Scouts would be a cool organization..... find your favorite homosexual and spread the word!

      I don't think I outlined the last LAST time I spoke with the ex. The Schnig, if anyone remembers.  You see, I have this friend, T, who is a guy. He is absolutely awesome. He is over six feet and his girlfriend, one of my best friends, is under five feet. He is sweet as can be and despite often claiming to be a reject, he gives great advice. A hug from T can make my day go from shitty to great, because he just has a good sense of people.   T is the one who .... well, this one time the Schnig and I had a huge fight (post-breakup) and then he showed up at Chili's after a football game, where my friends and I had made plans. The fight had been about how I said to someone "I don't want the Schnig to come with us. He makes me sad," but he got la pissed and made a huge deal out of it. I then sucked it up and asked him to come sit with us, and he acted as though nothign had happened, declining because he was "going out."  So I sat on my car trunk and cried and was too embarrassed to go back into the restaraunt. So T came out, picked me up like a baby, and carried me inside.  One of the top ten best moments of my life.  So anyway, though T is awesome, he has one flaw - he's a teenage boy. Which means he's got sex on the brain. And tho he has stated that he won't do NOTHIN' before he's married(damn, he makes ME look like a slut!), he makes sex jokes ALL the time. Pervy stuff. Like, I'll say "Oh, Jenny's coming to the movies with us!" and he snickers.  So he had come up with this "great" joke where he held his hand about two feet away from my butt and acted like he was an old-man pervert, or something. It was actually quite funny, but it got old fast.  But then I made some joke and he was like, "Audrey, don't be such a perv!" I reply, "Well, you're the one who's been grabbing my ass all day!"  The Schnig: "Well, it is a NICE ass."  We're in the fucking BAND ROOM, for crying out loud. In front of PEOPLE. And TEACHERS. And to look at his face, I have no idea if he was even kidding!  Embarrassing. Oh god. It was awful. I don't even know who heard it!  And also, there's that whole thing about how I don't like guys to make comments like that to me. Especially not my "friends." Easpecially not the ones I've dated.  T's eyes got kinda big and he left after a minute. I rememeber this vaguely - I think i playfully smacked the Schnig in the stomach as he said it,t hen realized what he had said, gave him a nice eyeroll, and walked away.  I vowed not to speak to him till he apologized. And we hadn't spoken in almost a month.  But then tonight I really needed to call my friend and I had lost her new phone number. So I had to call him to get it. And in talking to him, I kind of forgot I was angry. And then we talked for two hours and made a date to have breakfast tomorrow. Oops.  No, not THAT kind of a date.... I hope. But then, I'm still gonna shave my legs.

      I haven't done a crochet post in a while, but I feel obligated, on behalf of the yarn-purchasing population of my area, to tell you about my love affair with yarn.  Back in the day, I'd assume the 70s judging from my mom's experience, there was not a whole lot of choice when it came to yarn.   There was a lot of worsted and a lot of fingering, and a LOT of sport.   There were solid colors.   There was scratchiness, whether it was synthetic(acrylics? polyesters?) or natural(sheepses.)  Today is different. Today, we have so many weights and textures - bulky and chunky! Micro-fingering! Eyelash and boa, mohair and boucle, chenille and cotton!!! They even make yarn out of Polartec and terry!  We have variegation! We have tweed! We have no-dye-lot!  We have baby yarn, soft pastels!   Kids' yarn - the thick, primaries-and-neons variegations!   The "teen" yarn, the stuff that made knitting "cool" - the fuzzy stuff to make those [revoltingly popular] eyelash scarves, and the honorable chunky, silky, colorful Homespun - guranteed to make even the worst stitching look elegant!   The stylish "adult" yarn - loopy boucles in bright colors, soft mohairs in earth tones!  And the rest of them - the denim print! The magic-stripey! The sparkly holiday yarn!  So much yarn.... so much beautiful, soft, ARTISTIC yarn. So much choice!  And when you dream up a pattern, and you look online to see what could make that pattern come to life....   You realize that it's just so soulless to buy yarn online. You have to see it in real life! (And real light!) You have to touch it! You have to feel its warmth and its weight!  You have no choice. You MUST shop.  There's a sense of urgency as one embarks on a yarn hunt. You enter the craft store knowing EXACTLY where to go. You envision the project that will begin as soon as your perfect yarn has been found. You hope and pray that IT is there, that it hasn't sold out, that it's stocked, that it's in the right colors....  And you end up face-to-face with an amazingly HUGE aisle of yarn!  (Isle of Yarn?.... what an idea.)  Two huge cases, reaching to the ceiling, filled with color! Rolls stacked on balls stacked on skeins stacked on those huge one-pound bags! A still-frozen avalanche of fibrous wonder, just waiting for you to enter!  You can't decide where to begin! Do you slowly pace up and down, giving each style the consideration it deserves? Or do you jump at the first one that catches your eye, even though there are NORMAL PEOPLE watching?  What am I talking about?...... NORMAL people don't craft-shop.  You jump!........ and it's a miss.   But the first one's always a miss! You never buy the first prom dress you try on, right? ... so there must be more!  You jump about, as more and more hook your attention. ALAS! It's all-wool-blend.... or it's super-duper-fine fingering weight.... or it's really scratchy, upon touch......or it's actually......well....... that one's kind of ugly, now that you look at it closely.  But wait.... you've scanned the whole aisle! Why hasn't YOUR yarn jumped out to greet you?  Is it hiding in the sale rack?..........No - just Easter and Christmas stuff here.  Is there another aisle? Is it on the end?  Okay.... okay. Time to pace up and down, scanning each type.  So... here we go.... It's almost found! Almost there!  Blue acrylic sport weight. ..... royal blue acrylic sport weight.... magical blue acrylic sport weight... dusky blue acrylic sport weight.... red.... scarlet.... gules..... tan.... beige..... cafe con leche........ cafe au lait..... cafe mocha.....cafe.... coffee........brown... mahogany.... ebony..... black.... black.... white.... white... white....   acrylic.  sport.  weight.  Can it be? An entire HALF an aisle devoted to five different companies making the EXACT same yarn?   Instead of stocking up on the fudge brownies, ladyfingers, and strawberry tarts of the yarn world, this store has about 7 different kinds of packaged, processed, preserved, and, i might add, eerily PERFECTLY ROUND chocolate chip cookies.  And so did the next store. And the one after that.  So many kinds of yarn. So many stores.  So much ugly yarn in stock.  And, as I'm discovering, such high shipping costs for online yarn shops.

        Administrative thoughts:  Damnit! I guess all those people who got a rush out of being nasty to me didn't even care enough to check back.  That's ok, tho. I seriously hate internet flame wars, especially among people I don't know! it's better that one didn't start, and had those people checked back, they'd probably be as angry as I was that they took what i said so oddly. They've probably found someone else to "hate" for a day.  However, I did find the interesting blog of  urlLink David.  It's political stuff, written by David and his friend(whom i suspect to be a robot), but it's a lot more thoughtful than most any politically-focused blog out there. I recommend - these people/androids have a lot to say, but they're generally low-key and non-confrontational - just observations about our crazy system. Good reading, kiddos. -------------------------------------------------------------------  Now, something someone said recently sparked a thought train for me. How about the concept of "responsibility," or even "duty?"  There exist many kinds of responsibility. The first one you learn is "responsibility for your actions," which translates to children knocking over vases and then owning up to it. Obviously, everyone needs to keep this, from that child's play to the President's foreign policy.   This is a very important part of our society, especially with the capitalism. I mean, we don't do the whole "Glory for God!" thing anymore, considering that the amount of people who don't care about God, or those offended by the assumption that they DO, is gradually increasing. We still have the Puritan work ethic, though - work hard and you get rewarded. If you don't take responsibility for what you do, whether it be curing cancer (i wish) or murdering your wife, you never get what you deserve for the action.   Certainly, good deeds on the DL can be great, like anonymous donations to charity, or helping someone you don't know and never contacting them again. SO, I guess, the American child-rearing focus here is more on responsibility for BAD deeds. This is also important - guilt just isn't healthy. (Or maybe someone else gets put on death row, but it all comes back to guilt and fairness.)   And then we have the responsibility that comes with, for lack of a better word, possession. The responsibility of a parent to his children.... ... of a person to his car, or whatever toy he's got.... This is what you create yourself, because of the benefits involved. Sure, having children costs money and energy, but it's also probably the greatest kind of love a person can experience. (this comes from a non-mutter, but I assume from the attitudes of others...) It may be hard to keep up a car, but it benefits your life. But what if, for example, you child is born autistic? - or you aren't such a good driver? - It demands much more than what you expected! That kind of responsibility is the risk we take in improving our lives.  And then there's the whole "working-world" thing. The basis of it, to go economic, is that an employer has a responsibility to compensate his employees for their work without cheating them or abusing their help. Likewise, the employee is reponsible for performing the duties they promise to do, so that the employer does not waste money in overcompensating them.  This is why we have minimum wage laws, child labor laws, etc. This is why we have sales goals in retail and work codes of ethics.  Or, also, the responsibility of a government official to his constituents. He has to show that they have not elected him in vain, that he will keep his promises, that he will do his job to the very best of his ability.  Or what about the responsibility of a teacher to his students? To do the best work possible, that they may gain the best knowledge possible.  And then there's also the responsibility of using resources. Humans try to not use up all the Earth's fossil fuels, or kill off all the animals. Students work hard in school, because they feel responsible for making ht ebest use of what's available.  Or the responsibility of improving things - to not just "cut corners" and do the minimum, but to really make something better. Taking a hard class at school because the knowledge will pay off... allotting government funds for the arts....   And i think that leads into what I consider to be the most important responsibility a human being can assume - the responsibility they owe to other people. We have a responsibility to treat others WELL. To be kind to them... to avoid infringing on their rights. To sometimes give up something less important that we want, so that a greater amount of people can live free and happy.   To drive safely when there are children around.  To bake casseroles for a family who's suffered a loss.  To show your support for hard-working politicians who so rarely get the recognition they deserve.  To curb your anger at your job when speaking ceremonially to a waiter you've never seen before and will never see again.  To give what you can in a romantic relationship, and not to simply take for granted what your partner may do.  To NOT act on animal impulses - to not rape a pretty girl, to not smack someone you find annoying.  To care about the well-being of all humans, even those who will never affect your own life.  This is a responsibility we all have, and one that most everybody acts on. If we can all view each other as active holders of this responsibility, then maybe we'll treat each other as equals.  We all have the capacity to perform the basic human duty we owe each other.  Perhaps i'm a little idealistic today, but you've GOT to realize that responsibility is not ALL about actions and possessions and work - it's also about existence in a society.  And if we can just try to fulfill what society needs of us in our attitudes toward others, then maybe our society isn't as short-lived as some predict.  Maybe it IS a rising sun on that near-proverbial chair, after all.

      Does anyone, out of the four or so people who read this, remember that ironic post i made a few measurements ago? It was when I read some weird "liberals suck!"  urlLink website , criticized them, and then wistfully remarked that people should stop criticizing each other?  Yeah... well, the guy who wrote the post that sparked me, read MY post and skipped the sarcasm. SO nwo he and his buddies think I am an illiterate, fat, liberal, teenaged relative of Michael Moore, or something.... And they think I am angry at them, or something. (Well, I am kinda angry now, but I wasn't when they went berserk on my comments option.)  And they criticized my grammar and tone!  urlLink Who would EVER be that nerdy?   I dunno. I wish sometimes that people would take things with a grain of salt, but I'm pretty sure my post made at least one of you smile. And if I can just stop one person out there from saying shitty things about "the others" without thinking about how pointlessly rude it is, then I can die happily.   And since so many of these people would like me, my references to books and music, and my damn colloquial tone dead, then I think everyone will be happy.  FROM THE PISSED CONSERVATIVE DUDE'S SITE - SOME COMMENTS ON ME: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Posted on May 31, 2004 @ 10:24 pm by Jason  'ur' blog is betta, Lee. like, fer shur. that dude is all, and i'm all, and he's like, whateva...    DUDE! What are you, a sped? No one says "fer shur" anymore. It is "fo shizzle." GAWD!!! *twirls hair around finger bershonly* ------------------------------------------------------------------  Posted on May 31, 2004 @ 10:24 pm by Nick   Wow,  Still, he (or she) has zero comments, so maybe he (or she) is actually a complete fucking loser as well as an obvious fuckwit.  He (or she) couldnt get a clue in a field of clues, covered in clue attractor on the clue-iest day of his (or her) life,  Nick   Clueless, you imply? But I ALWAYS figure out Blue's Clues! (note the link to my man Steve Burns at left.)  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Posted on May 31, 2004 @ 10:29 pm by Sipidation  Read some of the other great post like:  Samstag, Februar 14, 2004 "forty-two"  Some of my friends tease me about being a "sex addict."  Freitag, Februar 13, 2004 no, not the sandal  I am wearing a thong.  For the first time in my life.  And ya know what?........... I don't hate it.   You would think these guys would get the "forty-two" reference.... but since they obviously don't read entire posts, that wouldn't really matter.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Posted on June 1, 2004 @ 12:13 am by Matthew Spence  I think her list of links says all you need to know about little audrey.    Oh no! So, reading blogs is.... NOT cool? NOT intellectual? NOT politically involved?  "I'm Captain Obvious! ANother mission complete!" ----------------------------------------------------   Posted on June 1, 2004 @ 8:35 am by Josh  "Bigger than my body gives me credit for." Could this be Michael Moore or his daughter?    Um, if "I" am bigger than my body, doesn't this mean that a) my body is small in stature or b)that my "soul" is big?  I dunno.... I guess you guys know everything when it comes to figurative language.  -------------------------------------------------------------------    Posted on June 1, 2004 @ 10:08 am by Paul  Clearly this asshat has never actually read the Geneva Conventions. It's amusing to see the phrase "Geneva Conventions" bandied about by people who have no clue about the contents.    Oh yeah. I totally stated that I read them, eh? Actually, what I got from History of the AMericas was that it had standards for how POWs are treated. But then, I have no clue, right? ---------------------------------------------------------------   Posted on June 1, 2004 @ 10:12 am by Drumwaster  Or the phrase "International Law" (with both words capilatlized, as if that would make it both real and applicable).    Yeah, cuz I said that. *eyeroll* And your spelling AND grammar make me want to vomit.... liberal propaganda, that is! ---------------------------------------------------------- AND FROM MY OWN COMMENTS. -------------------------------------------------------------------  Was there a point to that incoherent rambling? - Brandon    Yes. It showed my own calculated hypocrisy, essentially trying to tell people to NOT be hypocrites when it comes to this whole stupid "right-vs-left" thing.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Does the geneva convention apply to non-military combatants? - Jason    Nope. Well, I'm not the lawyer in this family, but I have always understood it to be a "time-of-war" kinda deal. Bu I'm a stupid liberal asshat, so maybe you should ask someone else. And am I stupid, or is it "Geneva COnventions?"  Anyone else seeing a new kind of advice column? "Dear Liberal Asshat...." --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    http://ian.gerdesdesign.com/images/news/liberal.jpg - marc    Yes, ma'am.   I'll gladly stay out of combat.  But don't use the word "pussy" around me again - I have an irrational cat phobia, and the chauvinistic implication of the way you used it is awakening the feminist within.   Grr.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    What the hell are you on about, you stupid American douche-bag. I’ll agree that this article is a poor example of liberal bias but only because there is so much more out there, in greater quantities; however if you really can’t perceive the bias here then I pity you.  Tell me when was the last time you saw the mass graves newly found in Iraq being plastered all over the media? I doubt even Fox News went that far. And yet your talking about 1000s of lives gone, executed; and all they get is a small slot on CNN, gone in a day. Now when was the last time the prisoner scandal wasn’t plastered all over the media? UN OFF scandal? Nope. Bet you don’t even know about that. - Poosh    Wait.... when did I talk about "1000s" of deaths? Are you even on the right page?  I would appreciate it if y'all would read my posts before attacking them, mm'kay? *head bobs, teeth sparkle, ponytail bounces*  Also, grammar = SUCK. But let's ignore that. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Such drivel, young 'un. Hope you learn to write someday, keep practicing. And when you grow up and assume some responsibility in this world you'll look back and realize what a little idiot you were. - Bill OH    One of my managers at one of my jobs calls me "littl'r'un." Is that what you meant?  And as for the responsibility thing, we won't go there, especially after the post you're referring to. Obviously, OH ain't no TOK.  (or LA - your grammar is pretty sad, too.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    ON the one hand you deplore right-thinking.com's author's lack of tolerance and political rigidity, on the other you say that 'the sun is setting' because essentially you disagree with his opinions. Those in glass houses....  I do agree that the US should be held to higher standards in its treatment of prisoners than dictatorial Middle Eastern kleptocracies. I don't think that the rationalizations for the prisoner abuse are so much an ends-justify-the-means as a "yes, we're human, and imperfect, but lets keep this in perspective" thing. Yes there are limits to this view, but I don't think that you should dismiss it out of hand. - David   David, I think you're cool. Thanks for saying what you want to without being rude about it, as well as highlighting my point for the others. And I think "kleptocracy" is one of the best words I've heard in a long time. (begin sarcasm) you are going on my "friends" list that I have to start to prove that I have them. (end sarcasm)  The "sun setting" thing actually referred to how I foresee Americans killing each other because we get so angry about disagreements. But thanks for pointing that out and giving me a chance to clarify, anyway. You're hot. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    (And by that, of course, I must mean "kill a Republican.")   Such peace, love, and tolerance.  At least Lee doesn't say to kill people for their beliefs in his blogs. - Josh   hahahaahhahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha *breathes* hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahahah *breathes* Oh, man! You can't make this stuff up. You really can't.  If everyone in the world thinks like you, I can understand why these people think I harbor ill will toward them. Verbal irony, anyone? Point, anyone? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I think its pretty clear that she's being facetious with the 'kill a Republican' statement.  But in her post, she seems to doubt that there is a general liberal bias in the media, and seems to find conservatives of her acquaintance fanatical. I would hope that she would not be so rigid in her worldview so as to not be able to see what is in front of her, or be unable to have a respectful conversation with someone who disagrees with her. David    Again, David has kindly assisted the meanies in understanding me, while still saying what he thinks about my opinions. Criticism WITHOUT malice? Could this be what I was searching for in the post?!?!?  David, will you marry me?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Audrey,  "An American teen. Bigger than my body gives me credit for."  But apparently larger than you own sense of self-importance.  If you're going to Fisk someone, at least have the presence of mind to counter with good arguments; otherwise, your words will be and have been taken as nothing more than the vomit of your mentors.  Further, I could not find this quote anywhere in Lee's post or the comments: "tha Ay-rabs." This must be a racial slure of your own fabrication?  Before you slam other people, take a closer look at yourself. - Kurt    Hey.... I love your name! Are you German? I LOVE Germans!  Wait.... if I'm bigger than my own sense of self-importance, then I have no self-esteem. I actually think my own sense of self-importance is bigger than me. Is that what you meant?  I mean, that whole "vomit" thing is nice and original*, but I didn't realize someone had told me to think this way. I dunno. I thought I had come up with this on my own, but I guess it was brainwashing by CNN or something.  Also, the "ay-rabs" thing was not put in quotation marks to denote quotation, but to denote an "abnormal" figure of speech. Something out of place. Something.... facetious, even? FY infizzle, it is an inside joke with someone. Probably an imaginary friend, though, if you buy into what my buddy Nick said earlier.  So did you want me to look more carefully at my hypocrisy, to which I devoted an entire post, or what?  [* - denotes sarcasm]  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Wow, you have been bitch slapped, havent you? - Kimble    I would indeed have been bitch-slapped from here to the moon and back again, had I taken myself as seriously as some of these people do.  And did you know that your name rhymes with "thimble?"  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Cool Dude, I say you hang out at Right-Thinking. You just might learn something. You might be surprised to learn not everyone is a Republican. Its nice to see you lump everyone into one box. How sad. - Kilroy    "Wait.... what?..... That's cool, I don't even care." I guess that even though I refer to many non-Republicans here, I think everyone's Republican. Might as well go "hang out" in this "box" of yours that I apparently lumped people into at some point. Does it involve free food? Because me and my father Michael Moore need fuel for our hatred.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Man........ I should have seen this shizzit coming, based on the comments pages  urlLink here  and  urlLink here.  But it's all good.   I'ma go dream up new ways to spread propaganda and be mean to conservatives.  (Just be fucking CIVIL to someone for me, okay? Make my "loser" life worthwhile.)

      Hell yes, I do.  My freshman year in high school was also the year my band director came to our school. That year's show had a "night" theme, and the tunes were Tossin' and Turnin,' A Night in Tunisia, Stardust, Saturday Night Fever, and Late in the Evening, among others. It was a wonderful show - it had so many different genres and feelings in it, and it was exciting and it was the only show i had ever marched before, and it was so special.  I had the misfortune that happens to every other rookie band class of having my very first uniformed performance at an away game. I remember little bits of it - how I was the bus captain, which was weird because no one remembered having freshman captains before, but that later became a normality with the director. I remember having my first conversation with B that day, and him telling me some story about a  Jackass  episode where someone hit someone else in the nuts with a hammer. I remember when we came for report time, how all of us freshmen had our hats on with the brims way up high, and all the seniors pulling them down over our eyes. I remember warming up in the parking lot with my section and feeling like I was going to throw up, and seeing that reflected in the eyes of my best friends. I remember how much fun we had in the stands, singing and cheering and chatting with the upperclassmen. I remember how, marching in, after a lecture about not allowing anyone to break the line, some rude woman stepped out into my path and then looked at me and asked if she could get through, and how I didn't meet her eyes because I was at attention and just tried not to step on her, and how my revered section leader was in front of me and how the director was walking beside the line at the time, and how no one ever got mad at me for it, and now I step on people who try to break the line. I remember hitting that very first pivot in the line coming in, and how I did it perfectly, and how the director was right there.  I remember when suddenly it was halftime and it was time to put on our hats and gloves and march down the stairs, and I was scared out of my mind, and how the guest band always goes first, and how we stood in front of the stands and the freshman boys were trying to get someof us to move but we didn't, somehow, and how we got out onto the field and I was so afraid and how the senior in front of me counted the  duts  and how somehow, during the big swing phase of Night in Tunisia, I realized I was marching it in uniform, and I started to play, and how it felt when we brought the horns down at the end of what we did that night and I was panting and my arms hurt and I realized I had done it.  I remember the competitions when we'd spend the entire day with band - practicing in the morning, then all the girls would cram into the bathroom to paper-towel our faces and put on eyeliner and lip gloss and french-braid each other's hair into pigtails, and then we'd eat lunch in the bandroom and then we'd do the hi-dee-ho, which was just a big cheer, and then we'd get on the buses and when we got to the schools, we'd watch the other bands compete, and see how some other bands were allowed to march and realize how good ours was, or see what cool things you could do with a marching band.  Then we would go to the buses and get out stuff, and we would change, sometimes in a bathroom or locker room, once in a gym with chaperones covering the windows so the boys couldn't see us, and we'd have to have someone else zip up the jackets and we'd stuff our hair into the hats and go out and warm up, and then when we marched people watched and listened because they were there for the bands, not the football teams, and they knew what was good and what sucked, and they would clap, and I remember how I felt at the end of the closer, because we ended with a "Hooah!" on the horns-down and it was just amazing, the rush you got out of that.  I remember practices in the fall and the winter, how the weather would change, how we'd be sharing bugspray or huddling together, how B would run around trying to get us to play football when it was freezing because he had just moved here from Philly and thought the weather was nice instead of hot like it had been. I remember how good it felt to go home after practice and take a shower and go to bed feeling like you'd accomplished something.  I remember Waffle House and Chili's after games, and sleepovers after competitions.  I remember eighth grade, feeling awkward and insignificant, and then suddenly I was in high school and I was in the band, I was important, I had people who cared about me and looked after me as I found my way through high school. I was loud and hyper and weird again, instead of introverted like I has become as adolescence set in.  I see now, in the freshmen class, the ones like me - they keep a low profile, but every now and then you get a glimpse of the outgoing, crazy band person hiding inside of them. They're learning, and they're going to be a strong senior class.  Few of us will go on in music after high school. I love it now, but it's something fun, not a career choice.  We stay in it because we love it - this group that simply takes people in and makes them feel welcome, needed, wanted. We grew from scared freshmen, and now my class is the cool, calm, collected senior class, and we've watched two other classes growing as well.  I wouldn't be myself if it weren't for marching band. I would still be afraid to speak up and out, to say what I actually think to anyone, whether it sounds ridiculously intelligent or ditzy. I wouldn't be proud of myself the way I am today.  My last band camp is over, and I'm about to jump into my last marching season. I am neither the first nor the last person to go through this nostalgia.  I've seen, a few times, exactly what marching band is all about. I've watched the others as we march into competition, and seen all these different people - different ages, races, religions, economic classes, intelligence levels,  athletic abilities, musical abilities - walking the same way for the same purpose. Over one hundred teenagers, at attention, quiet and ready and relaxed and aggressive all at once.  When we march as a band, it isn't the loss of individuality people make it out to be. Uniformity isn't about conformity - it's about purpose and pride.  Somehow, when we get onto the field, we can all work toward the same goal.  There is nothing in the world like marching band. I will never be in another organization like this, and it will hurt, but I'm lucky to have been a part of it. Yeah-whoa-hey-yeah-whoa.

      I'll be away for the next week because I have band camp.....   Marching, playing, hurting, etc.   If I see any metaphors for human society while I'm up there, I'll let ya know.   However, I'd just like to ask if I am justified in this.   For&nbsp;the past few years, girls have been permitted to wear spaghetti strap shirts during practice,  under the condition  that they wear at least a sports bra with  full straps , if not a full tank top,  underneath it , and it doesn't display too much of the bra [pretty much anything besides the straps]....   and if boys have been allowed to wear this sort of outfit&nbsp;too, when they cross-dress for humor on certain dress-up days and skit nights..... (which is when we have a theme like Tacky Day or soemthing and everyone dresses accordingly for prizes)   Is it fair for a parent to change the rules, in that now no one can wear spaghetti strap tops at all, "no girls OR boys".... and  then  say, "Well, I should take that back... sometimes on dress-up days you'll see&nbsp;them [nodding at a boy]wearing those?"   Keep in mind that this is MARCHING BAND, not cheerleading,&nbsp;and we wear them for comfort, not to be sluts or whatever it is they expect. [Although if they were just banned totally in the first place, we could get over it easily, because there are other comfy tops out there we could live with.]   The problem is that she implied that it was okay if guys wore them to mock girls, but not if girls wore them for comfort. Which is absolutely ridiculous.   Wouldn't most anyone who is not an ADD pervert who spends a lot of time around men in tank tops,&nbsp; find a boy in a spaghetti-strap shirt much more distracting than a girl in one, especially&nbsp;during a time when we're trying to get work done? It's a much less common and more disturbing sight, and it's also just gross. Girls in&nbsp;spaghetti-straps are a normal sight in the world of a teenager in summer, and it's not like any more skin is being revealed than in a normal tank top. In fact, if you want to measure exactly, MORE is covered than in a regular tank top, if you wear the sports bras.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ?   Is one of them better or worse? I don't think so.  Plus,&nbsp;they just decided to tell us 3 days before camp, so now a lot of girls have had to shop for more appropriate clothes that they can march in without discomfort..... so those of us, also, who had planned in advance, are getting screwed over.   I am tempted like a mofo to call their bluff and go ahead and wear the Twin Day outfit that my friend and I have planned for over a month, which involves wearing a spaghetti-strap top over a sports bra.&nbsp; Since it's  on a dress-up day, for a costume , it does fall within the guidelines they laid out, and we'll be wearing the appropriate bras to cover ourselves up anyway. I kind of feel like we deserve to at least show them what's wrong with that rule, and I don't know who will have the guts&nbsp;and debating skills, should a problem arise,&nbsp;to do it but me.   If boys can make fools of themselves in comfortable tops, then girls ought to be able to wear them when they're being serious. If you ban some of us, you ban all of us. I can almost hear the "boys will be boys" coming, and there is no way I will stand for it.   Do I sound more like a pissy teenage girl who wants more than she deserves,&nbsp;than someone who sees a fairly   silly   double standard emerging? I think I'm a little of both, and I wouldn't be angry if we hadn't already gotten outfits.   Still, they cannot do that and think it's fair. If the boys don't indulge in their little privelege, I'll accept it and sew the straps of the outfit, because then we're all equal.   But if I see any boys wearing them and getting away with it, you can bet I'll be doing the same thing,&nbsp;with a whole lot more modesty than they will. I'll make SURE I get away with it, too. I don't take kindly to being treated like a child by school officials or parents acting as a school representative, and I've usually always won in the past over&nbsp;stupid things like this.&nbsp;   And if I have to do it, I'll make sure I look damn good, too.

      He's breathing down my neck now.... I've probably read SOMETHING about him at least five times today.   Can't the leader of our country just stay out of my internet for a while?   But yeah. This upcoming election, as anyone with reasonable sentience (and eyes) can see, is not about liberty, or war, or gay rights, or patriotism, or any of those pretty words. This election is all about Bush. Some people just can't get enough of Bush. They want twice as much Buch. More Bush, please. Bush, Bush, Bush.   Basically, most of us who are considering The Kerry as a plausible vote-receiver do so simply because of our loss of respect for Bush. (Or else some of them never respected him at all, but it's all in the anti-Bush pie.) Bush is wrong. Bush sucketh. Anyone but Bush. Hold the Bush. Bush, Bush, Bush.   Ugh.... I would really, really love to be extra-super rebellious and vote for an independent candidate, but frankly, I don't find any of them any more appealing than Kerry, and at least Kerry, being affiliated with the Dems, has some chance of winning in the real world.   But in all honesty, I'll probably end up voting for Kerry, assuming I don't find anything that disturbs me on his record.   But come on... we're sick of all the Kerry-bashing. That's old news. We should get back to Bush.   See, I keep clicking random blogs and finding ICH HEART BUSH essentially plastered across the page. It's crazy. The thing is, though, so many of them are all like "Mryah, Kerry sucks" that I feel bad for them. I mean, why don't you rise above the opposition instead of stooping to the level of what one of you so aptly called the "party of hate?"   So on one chick's "personal weblog," which was more like a liberal-hating database, she had a link with a picture of a beer bottle cap which said Bush-Cheney. Its description read, "Bush Buds."   Oh. Wow. I bet Bush is pleased to see that his supporters photoshopped his name onto a Bud label.   Anyway, the site linked to  urlLink this  place. It's called Kerry Core, or Kerry-Core, or something similar, and is a nice idea if you're into paying for domain names for the purpose of making fun of a single man. HOWEVER, there are, as far as I can see, three things fundamentally wrong with this.   Number one: People insulting Kerry think they are Bush's buds. Unless Bush is as dumb as all those cartoons make him out to be, he probably doesn't want to run Kerry's name into the ground. What they are doing by insulting one candidate in the name of another is giving a few people a laugh and a few people another reason to dislike Bush. This basically blows as a move to further any sort of cause, unless your cause is to be annoyingly uninteresting.  Not only is that anti-Kerry thing sehr overdone, it is also done here in a rather unoriginal way. This is the second thing wrong with this site - it's actually not even witty or funny at all.&nbsp;Their idea of biting criticism is "'[Bush] must think we Democrats are the most idiotic buffoons on the planet', said Kerry."   Mmm. Subtle.   I mean, if you're going to make a site that satirizes the campaign site of someone else, you'd better damn well make me either wince or giggle. They describe Democratic supporters as "angry, dirty foaming hippies," and I swear to God, if I&nbsp;see that stupid "liberal-tree-hugger" concept trotted out one more time, I am going to take my tree and shove it up someone's ass.   But still, it's just mundane, regurgitated criticism of Kerry thinly veiled as some sort of clever parody.   This bring me to the third thing wrong here..... When you open the webpage, the description at the top says "John Kerry 2004 Parody Website."   Real clever, guys.   Audrey's tip of the day - if you have to explain to your readers that what you are writing is parody, then either your readers are blind, retarded bunnies, or you are not writing very good parody. If anyone actually reads this boring website consistently, I think both of those things would have to be true.   I am abso-fucking-lutely FINE with people voting for Bush, as long as they've put some thought into it. But this site isn't a very good way to show your support of any candidate who has minimal standards of self-respect.&nbsp;If you're going to spend time and money on dissing ANYONE, you might as well do it in&nbsp;a format that's aesthetically pleasing, or at least uses some cool fonts.

      I discovered  urlLink The Watchman Expositor  when I was doing a TOK project involving Mormonism, and it's pretty interesting. It profiles a whole bunch of cults and deviant groups and stuff.  &nbsp;  Now, through  urlLink dooce , I&nbsp;was reading about some ministry, and wnated to know if they were on the cult list. They weren't but as I scrolled&nbsp;this definition caught my eye.&nbsp; It makes me giggle.       Wicca:  The practice of witchcraft, nature worship, worship of the Gods and   urlLink  Goddess   ,   urlLink  paganism    and neopaganism, various groups with assorted names. In modern form, it is a revival of pagan religions (  urlLink  neo-paganism   ) and the worship of “pre-Christian” Gods and Goddesses. A common creed is, “Do what you will, and harm none.” Modern Wicca owes much to the influence of Gerald B. Gardner and has been further advanced by the writings of Patricia Monaghan, Silver Ravenwolf, the late Doreen Valiente, and the leading   urlLink  occult    publisher   urlLink  Llewellyn World Wide Ltd   . In popular culture, films and television programs such as  The Craft, Practical Magic, Sabrina the Teenage Witch,  and  Charmed  have helped attract teens and children to this growing religion.    Let's ignore "the Gods and Goddesses." They were trying, after all, to educate people about the religion, and they probably were a)confused or b)trying to make it much weirder and nonsensical&nbsp;than it actually is.  &nbsp;  No, the real problem was that whole "pop culture" part. Because Sabrina was totally into Wicca and Britney Spears, er,&nbsp;goddess worship..... she was so respectful of the earth...... even with all those Christmas&nbsp;specials and revenge schemes and meddling with nature and hatred of Libby et al&nbsp;and stuff.  &nbsp;  (What can I say, I was a loyal follower up until she got that internship at that stupid music magazine. It was&nbsp;fun to watch her at school, but not when she's in the real world. Enh.)   But&nbsp;I digress.... That show was a teen comedy, not a portrayal of pagan spirituality.&nbsp; Sabrina  was magic-without-a-k. Saying that someone converted to Wicca because of watching&nbsp; Sabrina, the Teenage Witch  is like saying that someone converted to Christianity because of watching  Frosty the Snowman .   I mean, all these people who have never watched shows like this,&nbsp;assume that they're all about&nbsp;black spells and dark worship, when they have nothing to do with the religion at all.   Like those people who believe Harry Potter is evil? Many admit to having never read the books, and then bash them for being occult and crap. Depending on how you define occult, maybe playful children's-storybook "magic" is, but hello? Do you allow your children to watch movies like Sleeping Beauty or Peter Pan or Cinderella?   Does anyone else see the humor in this? It's like they were BSing a paper for school and had to come up with some random sources, so they just pulled books off the shelf and carded them.  &nbsp;  Is it the term "witch"&nbsp; that bugs people so much? I mean, it isn't the religious followers' fault that mainstream culture turned it into something so different. It doesn't mean "a Wiccan" they way it should anymore. Now it means someone who does magic, meaning turns people into toads and shit, or someone evil who eats children or whatever.  &nbsp;  And "magic," too, now means pretty much something defying the laws of nature. "Magick" means energy that comes from religious observances, not something that carpet cleaner can perform. Do you think these anti-Harry-Potter-and-Sabrina people boycott products like  urlLink this?  Do they try to have their childrens' teachers fired for reading  urlLink this  in class?  &nbsp;  Oh, man. There are times when I wonder why I don't have a religion, and then there are times like now, when I'm glad of it.

      ... doing all this research about cutting. Self-abuse, self-harm, self-mutilation, and those all come un-hyphenated as well. &nbsp; Only it's not for a grade or something like that. It's like, IMPORTANT. It's stressing me out more than a Lit essay. If I fail this one, I will be screwed. And so will a lot of other people..... &nbsp; Right now, I am trying to make sense of all the information i've deemed helpful. (ABout 11.25 pages' worth on Word, buddy. Many spaces and varied fonts, but still a LOT....)&nbsp;  &nbsp; Big T, as he shall henceforth be known, has known about Jules' "problem"&nbsp;for a lot longer. I don't know how he found out, but I know it wasn't be seeing them like Angela and I did. &nbsp; (God, these fake names are killing me.) &nbsp; So after much discussion, hair-pulling-outing, whining, crying, and thinking, we're going to have an intervention. It's been going on longer than we realized and none of us can work alone.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I know there will be at least ten friends who will come if we ask, maybe more. We may be able to get the band directors, assuming they aren't required to tell the school. Unfortunately, Jules' parents are somewhat wacko. They're very controlling and sometimes actually just a teeny bit verbally abusive - it's always, "Get your butt over here and answer the phone!" or something. &nbsp; Angela also noticed that the way Jules talks to her younger brothers, who are in elemntary school, is probably influenced by her parents. I wondered why she was mean about stuff, but that's just how you learn to deal, I guess. I mean, I use humor, which came from my Elterns, so take from it what you will. &nbsp; Anyway, her parents are of the keeping-children-inside-the-home-will-make-them-good school of thought, and were we to tell them, we all fear that they would do something stupid like ground her and make her promise to stop.  &nbsp; Even my MOTHER thought of this. &nbsp; So.... I've been to all these wizeb sizites, which is exhausting. I'm hoping against hope that cutting is her only problem, so that her parents don't have a chance to muddle things up and alienate themselves from her even more than they already have.  &nbsp; However, she has post-traumatic stress disorder which gives her migraines, diabetes, and an ebbing relationship with a rather stupid boy that I am not a big fan of right now. &nbsp; I dunno... Don't worry about me, no need to pity-fy, but maybe if you're one of those "God" types, you could put in a good word.... I think I just need to put my thoughts out there, and I didn't want anyone to think I was just going to "forget" about it. We've got two weeks full of schedule-type activities, but soon, my dears, soon we will confront her, and I have a feeling that this will be the hardest thing I've ever done. Harder than AP Language, harder than weight training, harder than learning music. &nbsp; Damn, this will be hard.... I'm very glad I've got two of my best friends to help me through the planning. And Jules is very much worth it. &nbsp; I don't need anything&nbsp;surmised about an intervention right now, please. Contrary to popular belief, I do have common sense... but if anyone out there has ever staged one, maybe leave me some tips that you can't find on "support&nbsp; dot org" type places?

       To begin with, thanks to  urlLink goliard  and  urlLink David  for the responses. I may update sometime, but for now we'll just say progress is being made, and I think it's going to end up okay with Jules.    Jules just spent five days at the beach with my family and I, and I am tan as two short tan things. We spoke vaguely, without me having to directly confront her, but I think for now all I can do is listen, because she seems to know that it needs to stop, and I'm probably the only friend who wasn't thrown into a complete shaking panic by it. This may be because I know her well, or because I'm in denial, but I still refuse to shove "help" down her throat, for now. As long as she keeps talking to me instead of cutting, we can both pretend I don't know what's happened.   So, despite something that most definitely could have screwed up a vacation, the beach was fantabulous. We had some interesting encounters there, beginning on the day we arrived, Saturday.   The place we stay is a condominium thingy, which is basically shaped like an L with a pool in the crook, facing the ocean. So we'd be swimming and see these guy watching us from the balcony. If they weren't old, it was nothing to be alarmed about, and if they were cute, it was quite the ego boost.   There were three in particular that were together that kept catching our eyes and waving to us. Two of them appeared to be identical twins, somewhat fair, and then their friend was really really tan. We called him the Dark One. Doesn't it sound nerdy?   Anyway, after two days of waving and smiling and saying "hi" to these people when we passed them, Jules was ready to "take the relationship to the next level," as they say, and actually met them. She has a boyfriend, but harmless flirting means nothing to them. However, she doesn't exactly know that B and i have something of an understanding. [This one is of the "I love you, but my parents will castrate you if they find out we're dating again" variety, so essentially everyone is wondering why I don't hit on people any more.] So rather than reveal to her information which could cause my dear B bodily harm, I sucked it up and initiated a conversation.   I think it was something like, "Uh, we can't decide if you're identical or fraternal, uh, hi?" and then we spoke for a while. It was pretty nice, I guess, even though their "I can't run good"'s made me clench my teeth.   So these three guys (aged sixteen.... Jules and I are cradle-robbers, we are) had this other little kid running around witht hem that they had just met on vacation. He was short and looked like he was, oh, thirteen, but he claimed he was sixteen. (Hint - he's from Georgia and claims he failed his driver's test... of course, he doesn't seem to remember that whole learner's permit law we have. But yeah, he was sixteen like i was looking to date those guys.)   The kid was odd. He was always hitting on people, including the looks-to-be-twelve-but-says-she's-fourteen-and-wears-the-same-bikini-every-day-because-it's-the-only-skimpy-one-she-has chick, and was generally just kind of annoying. But then last night the twins both went down to walk on the beach with this blond girl and her little siblings. (Yes, they thought they were Big Pimpin.')   The Dark One was telling us about how Twin A is about to hook up with Blondie, but Twin B won't take the hint and leave. "Whenever someone's about to have a good time, [Twin B] is just taggin' along," he stated. He actually said "have a good time," but he had great abs, so we'll ignore that for just a little longer.   So then the twins and Blondie and the two little kids came walking up the boardwalk just as the Dark One is proclaming Twin B to be an annoying "bitch." Jules and I hushed them, because generally speaking, people don't usually like their friends to overhear them when they're talking about them. That, however, seems to be a Georgian trait, because they were all macho and "I don't care!" and crap.   So the Dark One, who we know is his best friend, jokes loudly that twin B is a bitch or something. Then the little dude started in, following along, and he called out "Tagalong!"   I don't know. This just pissed me off. This kid lies about his age and acts all "suave," trying to get in with the older guys, but he's basically just been a pig. Every time I was there, he'd be talking about some girl's face or hair or body. And now, he's pulling the classic dis-people-to-look-cool trick? That old trick of climbing the social ladder, right? You have to kick others out of the way.   Dear God. I know it was just some stupid pubescent male, and it was people who will never care again. But the principle of it! Where do you get off?   Jules looked at me, and I paused and said to him, "Wow. That was.... just... biting." I was being so obviously facetious that sarcasm was dripping from my fangs. Jules giggled.   The little guy: "Well, I don't care. I'm never gonna see him again after this week. You think I'm ever gonna see him again after this week?"   I looked at him. "I mean... well.... that was just so witty. And so cruel."   Little Dude: "I don't care. He's a tagalong bitch." Or some shit like that.   So I kind of looked at him for a minute, trying to see if he was serious. Like, he honestly thought that I found his attempted insult to be funny, clever and oh-so-not-repetitive.   He made a big show then, getting Twin B away from Twin A and the girl, and, like, dragging him off, and so then it was just me and Jules and Dark One in the pool. I think Dark One had some inkling of suspicion that there was something mildly ironic occuring, so he started doing cannonballs into the pool.   Jules and I just treaded water for a minute, looking back at where the little asshole had disappeared.   "He's the bitch," she told me.

      I am completely obsessed with  Degrassi: The Next Generation,  as viewed on Noggin. For those of you who a) like me, are slaves to a communications giant because of a family trade and therefore do not recieve this channel, or b) have better things to do with your time, Degrassi is a Canadian-made pre-teen and young teen soap opera.   It is fucking genius. These characters go through every possible problem teens could face, and they do it with perfect hair, dull wit, extra melodrama, and Canadian accents. (How long have we "bean" friends?.... I'm "soary!"..... Ask him "ote!" etc etc)  Anyway, so my favorite character on the show is Ellie. Redheaded, somewhat pretty, punky-gothy-kinda chick. However, she's awesome because she was always one of those mature ones who kinda saw through all the shit going on, without being annoyingly intelligent or rebellious. She's just THERE, but in a good, strong, important way.  But then, in one very special episode, Ellie's dad went off to Iraq and her mother parked her Canadian ass on the couch with a bottle of vodka. So Ellie's all stressed between trying to keep her mom, like, alive, and her dad from worrying, and her grades up, and also to hold on to this film internship deal she landed. So finally, when she sees a compass fall out of her backpack, she starts to cut her wrists.  Anyway, obviously someone notices by accident, and of course it's Paige, the resident bitch queen of this Canadian suburb. So it's like, Ellie's only "hope" is this chick who hated her, and competed with her for that internship, and Ellie has a million reasons not to trust her, but in the end, she ends up talking to the school counselor a lot and getting on her way to being okay.  So in a later episode, a miniature  Breakfast Club  in which some vair vair different people are thrown into detention together and forced to rethink themselves, she ends up talking to and "sparking" this guy she'd never really known before. This kid was Sean.  Both these kids had rumors circulating - while hers was about the cutting, his came from nasty allegations about his stealing school laptops and such. So they're lying on the school roof, talking, and one of them grabbed the other's hand. They kinda looked at each other, and Ellie said, "You don't seem freaked out by me."  Sean: "Nope."  Ellie then rolls down the wrist cuffs she wears, and shows him the scars of when she had cut. "Are you freaked out now?"  Sean ran his fingers across her scars, stroked her hand, and told her he wasn't.  Lately one of my best friends, Jules, has been writing depressed things on her xanga. Things about comparing her old boyfriend to her new one, and how difficult her family life is, and just how things are hard. Anyway, a few days ago she quoted Ellie from Degrassi: "Are you freaked out now?"  So today, I was planning to work out with another good friend, Angela, to complete some P.E. credit for me. So we're kinda lazing around my room, and Jules calls. She said she was on an hour break at work, and was wondering if she could come over.  It was weird, since I don't recall her ever asking herself over before, but of course we wanted to see her, so she came.   Jules, Angela, my mother, and I sat in my kitchen chatting about a million things, and at one point my mom went to tlak on the phone to someone. Angela was talking animatedly when she looked down at Jules' arm. "Oh, what happened?" she asked, pointing at a long red scab across the back-hand-side of her arm.  "Probably a cat," I quipped, in my usual anti-feline fashion, but Jules kind of ummed. I touched the scabbed-over wound and her wrist turned over, showing more.  Six or seven red lines, across the underside of her wrist, all the same length, all evenly spaced. As I ran my fingers over it, she finally said, "I don't know." Our eyes met and hers were frantic, as I tried to push back what came into my mind.  I fussed over it and dismissed it, and the conversation moved away. A while later Jules left. Angela and I were going to go and do our run, but my mother, who was making country-fried steak, needed us to go buy her some eggs.  So we're halfway to the grocery store, yammering about something random, when Angela said - "Oh God, Audrey! Do you think Jules cut herself?"  She saw everything, too - I wasn't the only one to suspect this. Angela cried in the car and we decided to tell my mother. However, her rooting around for her copy of "Reviving Ophelia" didn't quite give us what we'd wanted.  For God's sake, we know what cutting means. What we need to know is what the hell we're supposed to do now.  We're trying to plan a "girls' day/night" for the day after tomorrow. Maybe we can get her to tell us without letting her know we know. Maybe we'll have to tell her, and maybe bad stuff will happen.  I don't know what we'll do, but it will be something. It will be everything we can muster.  She wanted us to see it - she wore short sleeves, she asked to come over, she posted that goddamn Degrassi quote. She needs something, and she knows it, somehow.  I haven't cried yet, though Angela did as we drove home from the grocery. My Jules, my best friend... she's one of those who held me afloat during that dark time known as Getting Over B. She's done so fucking much for me, and she can't do this on her own.   Jules, we are NOT freaked out. We will never be freaked out. I will never be afraid of you, Jules, and as soon as we can come clean, i will never, ever let you be afraid of yourself again. You will never be alone.

      ... is what goes on in my head.  Today, I realized something cool about language. You know how "dead" and "bread" rhyme?   Well, the German word for dead is "tot." The German word for bread is "brot." They rhyme too.  Whoa.  Also, I can't decide which is better: "lizegalization" or "bahguggle."   The first came out of me reading back over the gay-marriage debate at  urlLink 1-800-FUK-U.  The second is how my best friend's two-year-old niece pronounces her birthday gift.   Thoughts?

      I just did another one-hour THRZ walk. I expected more hell, but about five minutes into it, it started raining, and rained for about forty-five more.  It was absolutely brilliant. It's so much easier to work hard when you're not fucking HOT. ALso, there were exactly NO other people outside when it rained. You get to jump in puddles, too.   And when given a choice between sweat and water, I would most definitely prefer water.

      Also. Jetzt fühle ich am schlimmsten.  Scheisse, scheisse.  Ich weiß noch, dass nicht so viele Leuten können deutsch, und dass keiner meinen Leser können deutsch. Ich fühle nur, dass ich zu viele Male dass gesagt habe. Wenn ich die selbe Wörter benuzte, dann werde ich mich krank machen. Heute war ein schlimmer Tag, und ich habe kein Energie mehr.  Ich muss dass aber hier sagen. Mein Journal braucht dass. Ich kann nicht ignorieren, ich kann nicht entgehen, ICH MUSS ES NICHT VERWEIGERN. SO habe ich bevor gemacht, und sofort habe ich mehr Probleme gemacht. Ich muss etwas hier sagen. Ich muss mich helfen.  Wenn Sie kein deutsch können - und jetzt bin ich sehr dumm - dann kannst du  urlLink hier  gehen.  B und ich haben schlussgemacht, und dass war nicht meine Idee.  Mist. Jetzt habe ich kein Lust, um das zu schreiben. Ich bin sehr müde.  Lieb mich, bitte. Ich erzähle euch alles, wenn ich besser fühle.

      I think I once absentmindedly told my mother that I'd love to live in the 1940s. "Everything just seemed so..... nice," I said.  She stared and replied, "Yeah, except for that whole war thing."  Touche. And yet, I still hold this dream of living in the forties. I would have those gorgeous bouncing waves in my hair, and wear red lipstick and adorable dresses and swimsuits, and I'd feel the solidarity of hating Hitler and loving FDR along with the rest of America. I could gossip with my girlfriends and crochet socks for the boys overseas, and i would probably have a dog like Skip.  I know, though, that I would also be unhappy, because I would suck at being a forties girl. I look terrible in red lipstick, and I couldn't possibly sleep every night with bobby pins sticking my scalp. They wouldn't even be the cool kind with the ball tips - no, they would probably cut my head. I bet that old lipstick was the kind that stains your lips and gets all over your teeth, too.  The other girls wouldn't like me, either, because I'd be too weird. I'd be loud and I would speak my opinions and talk about "boy" things and they'd get bored. And teachers would be like, "Audrey, shut up about Nietzsche, it's time to bake." And boys would think I was pretty with my great hair and stuff, but I talked too much, and I wouldn't sleep with them (because it wasn't societally okay back then, for the most part) so there would be no fun in it. So I'd, like, sit around crocheting and talking politics to my dog, but the only interesting thing to talk about would be how Hitler sucked, and even that would get old.  I'd probably dream of being a movie star or something, but the directors would get annoyed and fire me for being a diva or something. Or else I'd have to wear fur and shit all the time, and plug Ovaltine and war bonds and whatnot, and that would get boring.  I guess I don't really want to transplant myself into the time period, so much as I want to be one of those girls, but like, I guess the kind who goes to college and stuff.  It just seems nice, like everything back then was laid out for teenagers. Don't have sex, go to school, eat your dinner, and everything went the way it should.  I would be resentful, but I wouldn't be so confused.
