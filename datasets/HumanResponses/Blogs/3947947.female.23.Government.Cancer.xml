      Okay, so I was reading through the RNC2004 Convention updates, and it seems that 3 days after my posting on true conservatism and not being properly represented at our own convention, the RNC invited several TRUE CONSERVATIVES to speak. I cannot tell you how thrilled I am! (I know it was not because of me, but just knowing that the RNC is seeing their own mistakes is a huge step!) Senators Bill Frist, Rick Santorum and Elizabeth Dole were all added to the lineup of speakers. These are great additions to the other powerful speakers, and ones that may be able to reach middle-America and the more conservative counterparts of our great nation.

      I was reading a news article recently that said that in the year 2000, 41% of women voted Democrat, but that has now shifted to a percentage split at 34% Democrats, 31% Republicans, and 33% Independents. Of that though, the vote is split even more. Women who have children tend to vote more conservative (no matter what the party affiliation) because of issues that may effect family and education.  The issues that tend to be deemed the "Women's Issues" are not things that necessarily determine the way the majority of women in this country vote. While there are some who are staunchly pro-family and pro-life, they do not determine who they vote for on a single issue basis, for the most part. The same is true for the opposing side. (6% of pro-life women polled vs. 3% of pro-choicers polled said that the issue Life/Family/Marriage would determine how they vote in this upcoming election).  Ann Richards said today at the DNC Convention that "Men vote Republican, it's up to women to vote Democrat." I've never heard such comment from a 'progressive' woman. Wasn't the point of the feminist revolution to give freedom to women everywhere to make their own decisions? Apparently not if you don't agree with Richards, Steinem and Rodham-Clinton.  The media will not&nbsp;give in to the idea that the political atmosphere is quite different today, in 2004, than it was in 1974. Equal pay, workers rights and women's issues are all important, just not the only thing that we vote for, or look at when choosing a candidate, for the most part.  The most important issues weighing on the minds of American women are the Economy, Homeland Security, and Healthcare. The same three issues that are at the top of the list for the majority of men in this country.  I am not saying that the other issues are not important, because the reason I am republican is mostly because of the social issues.&nbsp;Those issues&nbsp;do determine why I vote the way that I do, however, when it comes down to it, I am going to vote for the most qualified candidate, and weigh all of the issues, not just one.  It's time to look at the issues, and let the media know that Women are progressive and intelligent and that is why we will vote for George W. Bush.

      As promised, here&nbsp;are (some of) my thoughts&nbsp;on the wonderful hypocrisy that is Michael Moore.  Yesterday at the DNC Convention he was quoted as shouting, "The right wing is not where America is at. Most Americans, in their heart, are liberal and progressive. It's just a small minority of people who hate. They hate. They exist in the politics of hate." He then went on to say, "They're not patriots. They're hate-triots, and they believe in the politics of hate-triotism. Hate-triotism is where they stand, and patriotism is where real Americans stand."  Apparently he hasn't heard himself speak lately. I have never heard anyone speak with such vitriol for anyone, as Michael Moore has about President Bush and this administration. Even Hillary Clinton nagging&nbsp;and Al Gore's drone put together do not come close to the obsessive style of ousting Bush.  Moore has devoted his whole life to exposing "the lie" that is George W. Bush's presidency. Apparently he hasn't watched any of his own "masterpieces." -He is consistently incorrect with facts, purposely editing quotes in a manner that would imply the guilt of W. And his BIG LIE of the link between Al Qaeda and Saddam to 9/11.  I am fine with people speaking their minds, but I don't appreciate when the said person is so unintelligent that they cannot come up with a factual representation of their side of the story. If you think that this administration misled the people of America, fine, that's your opinion, but PLEASE, have an intelligent defense, and make it reasonable before you set out to convince every living person on the face of the Earth of the guilt of one man.  Michael Moore claims that Republicans & Conservatives, "they are up at six in the morning trying to figure out which minority group they're going to screw today."&nbsp;Really? I don't recall the democratic party doing much to HELP minorities, other than giving them hand outs and disabling them more than they ever have been. (And besides that, I think he is giving WAY too much credit to most Americans, regardless of their partisanship, do we really think of anyone ever, especially at 6:00 in the morning)?  Apparently Moore forgot to mention the lavish penthouse he resides at in Manhattan, and the fact that his&nbsp;child goes to private school. (I'm not saying these things are bad, but I also don't shout at others who provide their families with the same luxuries). If you are so concerned with the drug problem, or the gang violence that is a common occurrence on any street in America, get off your butt and do something about it. Don't blame others, don't expect others to do something about it, especially when you have the means to help.  Moral of the story, Michael Moore is the pot, Republicans are the kettle. Don't shout hypocrisy when you are just as guilty, if not more so.

      During the Gay, Lesbian, Bi-Sexual & Transgendered Caucus this week (of course taking place during the DNC Convention), Senator Barbara Boxer, D-California, proclaimed that, "George Bush has decided that this year you are the scapegoat, and I'm here to tell you that nobody is going to make you a scapegoat." She then continued with "The choices of this administration are hurtful choices. No one should be rewarded for hurting people."  Really? Is that how she really feels? I remember her speech during the debates on banning Partial Birth Abortion, as compelling as her pro-abortion colleagues may have found it to be, I for one, was disgusted by it. If she feels that the Republican Party, one that stands for LIFE and the respect of it, is a hurtful party, then where does that leave the Democratic Party?  The Dems have repeatedly campaigned on the issues of "Women's Rights." When does the woman's right begin and the fetus' right end?  I can tell you that allowing a child to be killed only weeks from its own delivery cannot be something that 'feels good,' and yet the Dems are harassing the Bush Administration for their hurtful crimes. Over 44 million un-born children have been murdered, and WE are the ones that are hurtful.  Republicans are typically the ones who believe in the sanctity of life and the respect for the institute of marriage. We want a better America, a better world, and to provide a better life for generations that are to come. How is providing a stable environment for those that we care about, and those we do not know a 'hurtful' choice? Statistics have showed that with the divorce rate rampant, and the teen pregnancy, fatherless homes and abortion rates WAY up, the way to reduce these numbers is to provide stable homes, with a mother and a father, (not a mom &amp; mom, or a dad & dad), and to teach abstinence to our teens.  These are not hurtful choices, Ms. Boxer, they are responsible choices. Responsibility is something that the Democrats have long since pushed out the window by allowing more Welfare cases, advocating abortion on demand, and of course the ever infamous decision to teach America's children 'sex-education' by showing them how to put a condom on a banana. I say it is time that RESPONSIBLE Americans show Ms. Boxer and her counter-parts that we do not agree with her&nbsp;or anyone for the matter,&nbsp;peddling irresponsibility.

      Teresa has said that had she known that her husband John was going to run for President that may have changed her mind on becoming Mrs. Kerry. She has always been outspoken and rude, and it is common knowledge that she is not looking out for the "little people" or the average American, you and I.  Kerry advisors have done a fantastic job of keeping the Queen Bee's mouth shut and keeping her on target with her campaign speeches, while she stumps for her husband. It is no secret that she was not interested in becoming a political wife when her first husband, the late John Heinz decided to run for public office way back when. At the beginning of this campaign season she was rarely seen stumping for her husband, and didn't even take his name until last year! She has been known to speak about her late husband with great affection without mentioning the one she shares her life with now. Unless of course she is sharing private details of their business transaction-like marriage, including the pre-nuptial agreement.  In her latest escapade of political trash talking she told a reporter to "Shove it." Apparently Mrs. Kerry thinks that this is appropriate, and acceptable language and behavior. John has refused to apologize and says "My wife speaks her mind appropriately." Really? Harassing reporters is hardly the way to win the vote of the American people. Not that one reporter can do much damage when CNN devotes a whole weekend to Kerry, his family &amp; the running mate, the American people will have a hard time getting the whole truth.  Of course there is one upside to this whole fiasco. While some are disgusted by how uncouth T.H.K. is, others find it charming. One of those "others" is none other than Mrs. Hillary Rodham-Clinton. I can't say I am surprised though. Clinton and Kerry must be best friends or will shortly become best friends. They can make fun of the average Joe and the woman who chooses to stay at home and "bake cookies and have teas." I think the more that Heinz-Kerry opens her mouth, and the more that Rodham-Clinton stumps in her defense, the better off we all will be.  The best weapon in this situation is to let them keep talking. Sooner or later the real Teresa will come out, and when she does, no one will want to play.

      Why is it that County Attorney candidates are campaigning on the issue of Illegal Immigration? I'll tell you why, because they know that most voters do not understand the roles of a County Attorney & they understand that Illegal Immigration is a hot-button topic, and they want to cash in, at all costs.  This is not the first time that one of the County Attorney candidates has run on a platform that has nothing to do with their actual roles &amp; duties, if elected to the position. Andrew Peyton Thomas ran in 2002 on the platform of giving no plea agreements to child molesters, despite the fact that Attorney General (the position he was vying for at the time) does not prosecute child molesters. He is now claiming that he will stop illegal immigration.  Pacheco, like Thomas, has also implied that if elected he will end illegal immigration through prosecuting immigrant smugglers.  In a statement made by candidate Mike Bailey, he said "Although Maricopa County residents definitely pay the costs of illegal immigration, the County Attorney has no direct jurisdiction over immigration crimes. Still, we must absolutely hold the federal government responsible for the local costs of illegal immigration." He then added that the first step toward resolving this issue is to track the costs of illegal immigration at the county level.  At the current time neither the County Attorney's office&nbsp;nor the Adult Probation Office track the number of illegal immigrants committing crimes in this country.&nbsp; What must be done is retracting those bail rules which allow illegals to be released and commit new crimes, which in turn the authorities are too slow to act upon a true punishment. I say deport them for not obeying the laws (which obviously they had no respect for by coming over illegally). Who will you vote for when it comes to this important decision? Someone who is qualified as a former prosecutor who specialized in homicide and sex crimes cases, or two men who claim to have control over situations which they clearly do not.

      I have been reflecting a lot in the last few weeks about a lot of things, but to keep it generic we'll say "Life in General."  I often have wondered why heart break is necessary, and then when you look back, you realize that you were taught something by that person, about yourself, or about what you want from life. For those of you who have known me for more than 3 years, you know that the one great love of my life stole my heart, and then broke it in an unexpected whirlwind of emotion, that until recently I had no control over.  I dated, sometimes seriously, but most of the time, just for fun. Dating tends to be a sort of 'business transaction' if you will. At least for me in my life. I always took to the notion that life was rough, and love would make you miserable (which later proved to be true), so why not use that to your advantage? A free dinner from a nice guy was how I saw it, but then one day...  I fell in love. I don't mean this was one of those situations where I was in lust, I mean I TRULY gave my heart to someone. I didn't hold back. I thought I would marry this man, have his children, live in suburbia &&nbsp;shuttle the kids around in an SUV from one soccer practice to another Ballet recital.  Looking back I realize though that when they say that "Love is Blind," it is not a joke, and it is not a cliche. I really was blind. I was blind to flaws and misconceptions about life and what was to come.&nbsp;I am not saying that this person is a bad person, that he would whisper sweet nothings in my ear, and then retract all of his empty promises. What I am actually saying is that now, when I look back I see that those promises were obviously empty then, I was just blind to the common sense that would allow me to know that. Since this man, I have found it very hard to move on. Oh, I always tell myself that I have moved on and that I am over him. I actually have (unfortunately) broken a few hearts myself, because I am trying to convince myself, and others, that I am capable of loving another.  Fortunately for me, I have seen the light! (I hear one big sigh of relief from friends who have been waiting for years to hear this, and know that it is said in honesty.) It is only now that I know that it is true. It is only now that I know that I can love again, and its because of what I learned from that relationship.  Pastor Todd & Renee Matchett have always given me a bit of advice that I think everyone should follow, whether it be about love or a job, or whatever..."If you can take it or leave it, its not worth it &amp; let it go." You must be passionate about something, if you are not willing to fight for whatever it is that you have, is it really that great? If it is something that you cannot imagine living without, well then, what are you waiting for?!?! GO & TELL THAT PERSON HOW YOU FEEL!  I have learned in the last 3 years who I am, what I want for myself, and what I want from a future spouse. I am no longer content in being the doormat for someone. I know I am capable of being everything that&nbsp;a man could ever want, and I am someone that loves passionately & with all of my heart. I also know that I am good enough for someone to love me whole heartedly, by someone who is unabashedly unashamed of me &amp; our love.  With age comes wisdom, and the same is also true of a broken heart. You can look back later on and see things that you never saw, or you chose to overlook. You can be proud of who you are, and you can make decisions because they are what is right for you, and not ever be ashamed.  It's amazing how hindsight really is 20/20...

      Okay, so here's what I am really tired of: People obsessing about weight so much. And celebrities. Don't we have more important things to worry about?  I mean, don't get me wrong, I think that American's need to cool it with the McDonald's for breakfast/lunch/dinner routine, but as long as you are happy, and you are healthy, I don't really care what you look like, famous or not. I am so tired of standing in the check out lines at the grocery store & reading about how so &amp; so needs to lose weight, or this famous person tried this fad diet & they lost 45 pounds, and even though they disappear when they turn sideways, "Don't they look great?!"  It started with the reality show "America's Next Top Model" or whatever its called, and now we have the opposite end of the spectrum, an old, tired actress (Kirstie Alley)&nbsp;who has gained several pounds since she came on the scene is being given her own reality show. Don't get me wrong, I always liked Kirstie, she was great on Cheers, and in her own show "Veronica's Closet," but those times have passed, lets get over it!  In America we only really reward the extremes. Have you noticed that famous people are either really skinny, or really fat? There isn't an in between or happy medium.  And then there is my beef with celebrities in general. You know what? I really don't care who J-Lo/Britney/Lindsay/Hilary are boinking/fighting/working with this week. I have more productive things to worry about. You would think that the News Media does too. But I guess I should be glad they cover these things, the more they do, the less time they have to lie to American's about how awful American's are...

      I was reading Nation Review Online today & I stumbled across this article that I wanted to post. I thought it was very interesting, and QUITE disturbing...No matter what your personal views on "selective reduction" is, this is something I believe everyone should read...I absolutely LOATH the way she says non-chalantly, "can we get rid of one of them, or two?"  I have attached the article from&nbsp;the NYTimes Magazine, with a link to the NRO article.  _________________________________________________________________&nbsp;  When One Is EnoughBy AMY RICHARDS as told to AMY BARRETT   I grew up in a working-class family in Pennsylvania not knowing my father. I have never missed not having him. I firmly believe that, but for much of my life I felt that what I probably would have gained was economic security and with that societal security. Growing up with a single mother, I was always buying into the myth that I was going to be seduced in the back of a pickup truck and become pregnant when I was 16. I had friends when I was in school who were helping to rear nieces and nephews, because their siblings, who were not much older, were having babies. I had friends from all over the class spectrum: I saw the nieces and nephews on the one hand and country-club memberships and station wagons on the other. I felt I was in the middle. I had this fear: What would it take for me to just slip?  Now I'm 34. My boyfriend, Peter, and I have been together three years. I'm old enough to presume that I wasn't going to have an easy time becoming pregnant. I was tired of being on the pill, because it made me moody. Before I went off it, Peter and I talked about what would happen if I became pregnant, and we both agreed that we would have the child.  I found out I was having triplets when I went to my obstetrician. The doctor had just finished telling me I was going to have a low-risk pregnancy. She turned on the sonogram machine. There was a long pause, then she said, ''Are you sure you didn't take fertility drugs?'' I said, ''I'm positive.'' Peter and I were very shocked when she said there were three. ''You know, this changes everything,'' she said. ''You'll have to see a specialist.''  My immediate response was, I cannot have triplets. I was not married; I lived in a five-story walk-up in the East Village; I worked freelance; and I would have to go on bed rest in March. I lecture at colleges, and my biggest months are March and April. I would have to give up my main income for the rest of the year. There was a part of me that was sure I could work around that. But it was a matter of, Do I want to?  I looked at Peter and asked the doctor: ''Is it possible to get rid of one of them? Or two of them?'' The obstetrician wasn't an expert in selective reduction, but she knew that with a shot of potassium chloride you could eliminate one or more.  Having felt physically fine up to this point, I got on the subway afterward, and all of a sudden, I felt ill. I didn't want to eat anything. What I was going through seemed like a very unnatural experience. On the subway, Peter asked, ''Shouldn't we consider having triplets?'' And I had this adverse reaction: ''This is why they say it's the woman's choice, because you think I could just carry triplets. That's easy for you to say, but I'd have to give up my life.'' Not only would I have to be on bed rest at 20 weeks, I wouldn't be able to fly after 15. I was already at eight weeks. When I found out about the triplets, I felt like: It's not the back of a pickup at 16, but now I'm going to have to move to Staten Island. I'll never leave my house because I'll have to care for these children. I'll have to start shopping only at Costco and buying big jars of mayonnaise. Even in my moments of thinking about having three, I don't think that deep down I was ever considering it.  The specialist called me back at 10 p.m. I had just finished watching a Boston Pops concert at Symphony Hall. As everybody burst into applause, I watched my cellphone vibrating, grabbed it and ran into the lobby. He told me that he does a detailed sonogram before doing a selective reduction to see if one fetus appears to be struggling. The procedure involves a shot of potassium chloride to the heart of the fetus. There are a lot more complications when a woman carries multiples. And so, from the doctor's perspective, it's a matter of trying to save the woman this trauma. After I talked to the specialist, I told Peter, ''That's what I'm going to do.'' He replied, ''What we're going to do.'' He respected what I was going through, but at a certain point, he felt that this was a decision we were making. I agreed.  When we saw the specialist, we found out that I was carrying identical twins and a stand alone. My doctors thought the stand alone was three days older. There was something psychologically comforting about that, since I wanted to have just one. Before the procedure, I was focused on relaxing. But Peter was staring at the sonogram screen thinking: Oh, my gosh, there are three heartbeats. I can't believe we're about to make two disappear. The doctor came in, and then Peter was asked to leave. I said, ''Can Peter stay?'' The doctor said no. I know Peter was offended by that.  Two days after the procedure, smells no longer set me off and I no longer wanted to eat nothing but sour-apple gum. I went on to have a pretty seamless pregnancy. But I had a recurring feeling that this was going to come back and haunt me. Was I going to have a stillbirth or miscarry late in my pregnancy?  I had a boy, and everything is fine. But thinking about becoming pregnant again is terrifying. Am I going to have quintuplets? I would do the same thing if I had triplets again, but if I had twins, I would probably have twins. Then again, I don't know.

      Well, I am sitting here in my office & I decided that it was a Wide Awake kind of day. Do you have one&nbsp;of those cd's that you listen to when you are in certain mood, or when you want to get into a certain kind of mood? (Get your minds out of the gutter, I don't mean THAT kind of mood i.e.: Barry White!)  I have been feeling rather ambitious lately. People that I admire the most are those that step out on a limb. If there is anyone that I know that has done it, it would be these guys.&nbsp;Five guys from Seattle packed everything up & moved to Austin to make it in the&nbsp;music biz, and they aren't just some lame band, but they are REALLY good, and they actually have what it takes to succeed.  I hope that someone out there thinks the same of me.  The great 'theologian' Scott Leger once said, "If love is a drug I'm quite sure we're all addicts. We can't last for long with out some. Love is like a gift, if you give it, you will have it. This is why two are better than one." OR here's another great one... "The car that I drive is a miracle on wheels, and my typical day takes me from meal to meal. The road&nbsp;I've less traveled is my road of choice, as I carefully follow that still small voice. I don't need a trophy to warrant my simple life, cuz its what I like..."  Ahhh, following that inner voice to lead us to where we are supposed to be. Good word. Sometimes we forget that being comfortable isn't necessarily the best place to be.    urlLink http://www.wideawakeisaband.com/  -Check out Track 3, a special ode to Val :)

      John Edwards has never been my "type." I have never considered him good looking or intelligent. I have never thought of him as a sincere or earnest individual, but then I watched him & his wife Elizabeth on Larry King last night. UH OH!  First of all, let me defend myself -I normally don't watch that nut job (Larry King),&nbsp; but I was interested to hear what J&E had to say.  Let me say this &amp; get it out of the way, and GOD forgive me for this, but I really admire John Edwards. ANYTIME his wife spoke, he looked on attentively, he acknowledged her presence, he was comforting when needed & held her hand when appropriate. I also must state though, I am not for PDA in the slightest bit &amp; I thought Al & Tipper's display was nauseating, but there was something different about these two that almost made it seem okay.  I'm NOT a sucker, and it takes a lot to pull the wool over my eyes, but if I wasn't clear on where I stood politically, I might actually vote for the Kerry-Edwards ticket, because of Edwards, not because of Kerry (that guy needs to buy a personality with some of his wife's money!). John Kerry's advisor's made a wise decision when they chose Edwards as a running mate.  Many a stupid woman will fall for the southern charm &amp; seemingly flawless personal life, and the way he & Elizabeth have stuck it out through the hard times (a loss of a child- which right there will probably catapult them up at least 3-5 points) regardless of their own political stance &amp; how it matches up to his voting record & "vision" for America.  This race just got harder. I didn't take the Democratic ticket that seriously, but with the charge &amp; resurgence given to offset the Kerry drone, I may have to start.  LORD HELP US!! W-You had better get Usama, and SOON!   JUST FOR FUN:  urlLink http://www.noedesign.com/dev/KerryEdwards/index.html   (turn up your speakers, its more funny that way...Thanks PB!)

      My good friend Greg Fraker brought up an excellent point, that obviously I didn't think of, or it would have been listed in the last post on this subject...  There is some irony in the fact that the very "symbolic gesture" that these people use is the very symbol of their freedom that gives them such a right as to protest &amp; burn a flag........  That's all. Just thought that was a good point. And one that I missed. (Sorry, I won't let it happen again!)

      AHHHHHHHHHHH! What happened to being "Proud to be an American?" -Why do we need a constitutional amendment to get people to STOP burning our flag?  I am getting so frustrated with everyone using the FIRST AMENDMENT for everything that they do. Now Kerry-Edwards do not support an amendment to the Flag Burning Ban in the Constitution. Of course they don't. They are a part of the flag-burning, America-hating, French loving society of upper class elites.  Like I said earlier about the Homosexual marriage amendment, I don't believe that we need to amend the constitution everytime there is a debate on anything, HOWEVER, I believe that this is something that anyone with half a brain knows is a good thing to add. When men & women have died for the right to wave our flag in honor &amp; with pride we should not allow others to burn our flag. I hold disdain for anyone who does not respect our nation and the rights and freedoms that come to them, simply because they were born here.  If you don't like America, and you don't want to wave our flag, go somewhere else.  And that's all I have to say about that...for now.

      I am so happy to hear that the U.S. & our allies have decided to stick to our guns (pun sort of intended) &amp; we are NOT going to negotiate with terrorists.  It is a sad thing that we must do this, but I believe that it is the best way to reach our goals to win the war on terror. It is never a good idea to give in to anyone in these types of circumstances. "The Holders of the Black Banners" as they are calling themselves (come on guys, we couldn't get a better name?!) are holding 6 prisoners-&nbsp;1 Egyptian, 2 Kenyans, & 3 Indians. Yesterday a Filipino man was released because the troops from his native country decided that ONE man was worth risking the safety &amp; right to democracy for hundreds &amp; thousands of others.  I'm sorry, and I know this is a LONG STRETCH, but if it ever comes down to the point that I am held hostage by terrorists- LET THEM CUT MY TONGUE OUT OR BEHEAD ME OR WHATEVER!    NEVER, EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NEGOTIATE WITH A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION FOR ME    I know many of you are so happy to have my permission to put me to death, but remember, it is only under the extreme circumstances of negotiating with terrorists.  Now that I've said that, I'm off to get our President re-elected...

      A new report out from the Alabama Department of Health states that ALL public clinics in the state of Alabama MUST supply women who THINK they may be pregnant with the so called "emergency contraception" drug.  Dr. Donald Williams, of the Alabama Department of Public Health stated, "If the emergency contraceptives were made more widely available, more than 4,000 of 10,000 abortions would be prevented in the state of Alabama." Public officials also stated that the initiative is in the "public's interest," and it is protected by the $5 Million Federal Family Planning Grants available. I don't care what your view of the subject is, I do NOT agree with publicly funding these types of services for ANYONE.  I know that this subject is very touchy for some, but here are a few of my thoughts on the issue.  How can we dole out drugs to women, who obviously aren't capable of taking a regular Birth Control pill correctly, and expect everything to be okay?  We do not have comprehensive research available to us that shows the side effects on women who take the drug numerous times within a short amount of time.  If a woman is promiscuous, and/or lazy, who is to say that she won't just skip using a b.c. pill or having her boyfriend use a condom & go straight to the FREE clinic for an E.C. pill the next day?  I think that a lot of the problem with today's society is irresponsibility. We have made abortion on demand legal, and in doing that we are essentially saying to men &amp; women, "It's okay to be promiscuous. Don't worry about the consequences, if you DO get pregnant, all we have to do is give you a few pills, or do a 'minor' surgical procedure & you will be fine."  I think that the E.C. pills are sending the same message.  I know that some of you will agree with me &amp; some of you will disagree. I guess we will never know the full impact of these drugs until someone's body has had enough &amp; they die from it.

      Today is my birthday. Being away from home has been hard, but for all of my friends who have spent a birthday with me, you know today has to be REALLY hard for me.  My birthday is not really a day, but usually lasts about a week, or a month, depending on how we are all feeling. There can be anywhere from 5-35 people at one of these gatherings, needless to say,&nbsp;I love a party & I LOVE ATTENTION!  I have to say that I honestly thought that today would be somewhat of an out-of-sight, out-of mind sort of day for most people. It has been overwhelming how many people have called &amp;amp; written & sent e-cards. My co-worker even brought in flowers (pink, of course) &amp;amp; an oreo cake for me. Hearing Chandler & Kyle sing me Happy Birthday was the greatest thing in the world! Those two little boys mean&nbsp;so much&nbsp;to me! Its nice to know that they haven't forgotten me (I have to say that is one of my biggest fears!)  I try to count my blessings &amp; remember daily that I have a lot to be thankful for. Today is a great day that has helped me do just that. While I miss everyone TREMENDOUSLY, I also know that you all still care about me, and it doesn't matter how far or near we are to each other, we will always be friends.  Thank you for loving me. Thank you for being there for me. Thanks for being great friends!

      A word to those of you out there who are against the "War on Terror." -Grow up.  Millions of people died at the hands of Saddam Hussein &amp; his numerous thugs. America is not the bad guy here. Remember what it was like for those people who lived under his rule? (No, not if you were watching CNN) -It was NOT a happy go lucky time. Get real.  He allowed his sons to rape young women. Men, women &amp; children were killed for no apparent reason. He was steeling from the poor to make himself richer (have you seen those mansions? and how many of them he had? PU-LEASE!)  If you think that Iraq was a wonderful place before&nbsp;the U.S. &amp; our allies (YEAY TONY BLAIR!) got involved, you are living in a psycho dream world &amp; you probably take your political cues from the likes of George Soros &amp; Michael Moore. (Don't even GET me started on those two...Rest assured there will be many blogs devoted to those two America Haters).  Just because we live in the "Land of the Free, the Home of the Brave," it doesn't give us the right to make a complete ass out of ourselves everytime we open our mouths. Freedom is something that was fought for. Blood was shed so that we can make asinine remarks. Shouldn't others have that right too?  If you believe so, I found this website, and I thought it was really cool :  urlLink www.protestwarrior.com   Stay Brave, Stay Free...And remember to Thank God for the Freedom that allows you to thank God.

      I read that John Kerry & John Edwards both get their hair cut at the cost of $1000.00 a snip. I don't know about you, but I don't think I spend that on cut &amp; color in&nbsp; YEAR ! Give me a BREAK!  So that leads me to ask the question..."How are they like the AVERAGE American?"   The Kerry-Edwards campaign slogan is "Making America Stronger at Home & More Respected in the World." Interesting. From the First &amp; Fourth most liberal guys in the senate. Both voted AGAINST the $87 Billion to help rebuild Iraq & help our troops do their job better. And yet, they voted for the War. (I will not ever forget this line: "I voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it." -WHAT A MORON!) Do we really want two guys in power that voted to send our sons &amp; daughters into harms way & then voted against the funds to keep them safe?   I don't see how America is going to be made stronger with the Kerry-Edwards ticket when John Kerry voted to CUT our defense budget by $7.5 billion just TWO YEARS after the FIRST Trade Center attack. I think that Kerry-Edwards are more interested in making sure that the America haters in France &amp; Germany respect us more than they are worried about keeping America safe. Its funny when Kerry says that there are foreign leaders that secretly&nbsp;have told him they would like to see him win the election this year...I bet I can name a few...Chirac, Shroeder, Hussein, Bin Laden...  &nbsp;  Its time to kick anti-semetism & anti-Americanism in the butt.&nbsp; Its nice to know that we have a cowboy in office who doesn't mess around. If you don't play by the rules he has no qualms about taking you down, just to make sure that his constituents are safe. He is looking out for the American People, and the people of Iraq, and Afghanistan, and North Korea, and Libya, and anywhere else where there are murderers and terrorists.  That's why a vote for Bush-Cheney is a vote for a safer, more respected America.  DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS- OR THE USA!!

      I once heard someone say that if you aren't living on the edge, then you are taking up too much space. I thought at the time that was a ridiculous statement. After all, not everyone was called to be an adventurous individual, and that goes for me in my own personal life. I have come to realize that it is not necessarily the heroic acts that we hear of on TV or the radio, or the crazy nutballs that sky dive & bungee jump&nbsp;that make someone adventurous, it is taking an uncharacteristic step of faith.  Those of us who like to be in control (particularly the first borns in the family who like EVERYTHING to be just so) have a particularly hard time with being 'edgy.' I for one am not a spontaneous person. I need to have a plan, and a back up plan, and maybe one more plan after that, just in case. I have found though, that being away from everything that is familiar, in its own way has made me live on the edge, just a little bit. I'm not saying that I go out & party every night or that I am the talk of the town, or anything even close to that. On the contrary, I leave work every night around 9:00 pm &amp; I head home. I don't talk to much of anyone, even my co-workers. Last night was Saturday, I was in bed by 8:30, and curled up with a good book & the news in the background , and asleep by 11:45. I know it doesn't sound edgy to most of you, but for those who know me best, this is a huge step for me.  I have always been the social butterfly, mostly because I am afraid of my own shadow. Deathly afraid of being alone, and always on the search for a new friend, or a new social setting. I am learning who I am, and what I want, for once in my life. I have no choice but to be on my own. It scares me to death, and even writing about it makes me cry, but you know what? I am going to be okay. In 3 months I will be home, with my friends, with my family, in my congregation. It will be like I never left...But on the inside, I will have focused on what I need, what I want, and where I am going.&nbsp;  Maybe one day I will reach the top of the mountain of 'self-awareness' -but right now, all I want is to be aware of God's will. I believe it was His will for me to be here, alone. But not really alone, because He is always with us, He is always near, and He is always faithful. I am searching for His will right now, and for once, I believe that I have found it.  To me, this is the most adventurous, edgy thing that I have ever done.

      With the recent Marriage Amendment taking a nose dive it makes me sit back &amp; wonder "Where have all of the TRUE conservatives gone?" -While I don't believe that an amendment to the constitution is the correct way to go about the issue, I also don't believe that those that have been appointed to the judicial system should have the power that they have from the bench. Many of the issues that we debate in today's society can be faulted to the Supreme Court &amp; lower appellate courts.  Abortion "Rights" as it is called, and gay marriage are two of the hottest debates in the upcoming races. If it were not for the judicial systems completely over looking the wishes of the popular vote, these two issues would be less of a fight.&nbsp;  60% of Americans believe that life begins at conception (apparently the other 40% have never taken a Science class)- John Kerry also believes that life begins at conception. Isn't it interesting that in this case he has voted FOR Government funding of abortions, against Partial Birth Abortions &amp; against Abstinence Education? He knows the baby is alive and growing, yet he still says its okay to kill him or her.  Which leads me to the point that I wanted to make (I know you thought I wasn't going anywhere with this...) The Republican National Convention that will be held this September has a whole host of speakers, most of which are Republican in name, but do not really line up with the conservative&nbsp;notions of Americans, whose vote is relied upon to win this election.  I find it astounding that the most conservative of all of the speakers at the convention this year (obviously discounting Bush &amp; Cheney) will be none other than Democrat Zell Miller!  McCain has disagreed with the President's stance on Gay marriage, Gun Rights &amp; Healthcare, and he is speaking, then there is Arnold Schwartzenegger (also another one of those "I believe that life begins at conception, but..."Guys), Rudy Giuliani (I cannot say anything about his leadership skills, because we all know he is amazing, but on the social side of things he is a bit iffy) &amp; Michael Bloomberg (need I say more?)  What happened to the things that Reagan &amp; his presidency taught us? He was staunchly pro-life, and he took a no-nonsense approach to his beliefs. The American public respected him for that, and he won both elections in 80 &amp; 84 by a landslide.  It is time that other (social)&nbsp;Conservatives be heard, especially in a time when we have such hot-button debates going on.  Two of the greatest and most passionate social conservatives that I can think of would be Senators Elizabeth Dole &amp; Rick Santorum. They both stand &amp; fight, even when they are called names and the opposition is great. Why haven't they been asked to speak? We, as Americans&nbsp;need to face the music, and the GOP needs to face the facts. These issues are not going to go away. We need to stop pandering to those that do not have our votes or our beliefs and stand up for what WE believe. The conservative vote cannot &amp; will not be taken for granted. President Bush needs 270 electoral votes, I believe it will be a lot easier to meet those numbers with the support of the social conservatives behind him. Respect our views &amp; don't take us lightly. There is power in numbers.

      Well, its been an interesting week, to say the least.  I packed up my life (that which I could fit into my car, anyway) and headed out for the unknown.  I am still lost & trying to figure out what EXACTLY I am supposed to be doing, all I can really get from anyone is that I need to register about 12,750 new voters by October 1st, here in Clark County...so however&nbsp;I choose to meet those numbers is up to me.  My co-worker, Jen & I have started working on some different ideas- this coming Monday we are throwing a HUGE Free BBQ, where we will focus on new home developments &amp; new voter registration. Things are a bit crazy- we have to do a 2,000 piece lit drop by tomorrow am. It's about 102 degrees outside right now, so we've decided to put that off until tonight.  Now for the exciting stuff...  I spent most of the day crying on Sunday, and an even greater part of the day on Monday I was hysterical. Tuesday I pulled it together & decided that my President needed me, and that is why&nbsp;I am here. It was time to suck it up, pull myself up by the bootstraps, and get on with it.  So even though I am lonely and afraid (and really don't know my way around, and get lost quite frequently) things are getting better. I figure if I can make it a whole 6 hours without crying, its a good day :) -so to say the least, this has been one of those things that if not for the love & support of my family &amp; friends, and my passion for making America a better place & standing behind a leader that I believe God has placed here for this time...I doubt that I would be here.  So, if I can give up my life and move away from everyone that&nbsp;I know just to make sure that W is in office for another 4 years...what can YOU do to help re-elect YOUR President?&nbsp;

      Not that I like Babs, I just thought this was a fitting title. There have been a lot of changes here in the office lately. I am not a fan of change, but I always adapt to it, knowing that I cannot stop it from happening. Recently, we had several new employees start. Since myself and the others in the office are extremely bogged down with work we were all excited to have the new people here. We have a good time here, and we wanted to enlarge our circle of love. Let's just say that not only have we decided not to enlarge our circle of love, but they are DRIVING ME INSANE! (with the exception of Gabi, of course). There is the new field rep who doesn't realize he is a field rep & is always upstairs with the other two new girls. They are all Mormon. I have nothing against Mormons, Jen is a Mormon, she is great. No big whoop, right? WRONG. B talks to himself & whistles, CONSTANTLY. How can anyone work like that? I certainly cannot. The new 72 Hour girl isn't even here today. It's her second day. She left at 6:00 yesterday. She took an hour lunch. Who does that, anyway? Does she not know that we have an election to win? TL is just plain snotty. She is all of 19 years old. She thinks she is better than everyone, never has anything productive, nice, or intelligent to say. For those of you who know me, you know I don't put up with rudeness, at least not when it is unnecessary. I say "Good morning." She looks my way & rolls her eyes. Pardon my French, but WHAT A BITCH. Then there is B. Poor little B. She has NO IDEA what she is doing. She managed to screw up more in her first 2 days than I thought was possible. Then she managed to book her airline ticket 3 times, so her card was maxed out & she couldn't get a rental car to Elko. Who does this? I mean, I am a space cadet at times, but really. The reason for my ranting is to say this: In Politics, and in life in general, you are no one, and you will get no where without others. We all need people. Every one of us. Whether we like it or not.  It's time to put our egos behind us, as hard as that is for most of us, myself included. I mean, most of us involved in politics have a head as big as a bus as it is. Ego is a part of the game.  This election is too important to put our differences ahead of why we are here. I would hate to say that the reason John Kerry is President is because Republicans couldn't work with other Republicans that weren't like them. Why are the Democrats the party of diversity? Why can we be? There is no I in Team. It's time we all realize that and get back to doing what is important.

      So I've been interested in this guy. He's well educated, funny, charismatic. All the things I am looking for. Well, apparently I wasn't looking for character. This guy has a GIRLFRIEND! I mean, who does that? Why would you flirt with a girl, and lead her on, fully knowing that a) she is interested in you, and b) knowing that you have a girlfriend? This girl lives in another state. Let's just say it is a farming state, and it is in the Midwest, and we'll leave it there. Do you think she trusts this boyfriend of hers that is 1,000 miles away? Does she know that only 2 days before her arrival he was flirting with ME? That last weekend I was dancing with him?  I was hanging out with this particular man in question when I asked what his plans were for the weekend. He replied non-chalantly with, "Oh, my girlfriends, um, in town." Oh really? Big surprise to me. Let's also mention the fact that he has repeatedly teased me about my feelings for him, stating, "You really do adore me, don't you? I think its wonderful." -Is that some sort of jackass remark that was made out of cockiness? If so, no thanks, I'll pass. I have a habit of picking the guys that are TERRIBLE for me. I think that it is some sort of sub-conscious, psychological thing that I do. I don't mean to, but I ALWAYS do. I fantasize their personalities &amp; put them on a pedestal, and create this image that is COMPLETELY ridiculous. Then when reality hits, I am in utter SHOCK. At least, that is the state that I am in now. What is my problem? Why can't I find a decent, loving man? One who is faithful to ONE woman, preferably? It might be the circles I run in. Maybe politics really do make strange bed fellows.

      I received an email from a VERY good friend this morning asking for prayer. I began thinking of how I have my own issues that I could use prayer for. I then asked myself, why am I not using the God-given gifts of His very own people? The Bible says that if two or more gather together in agreement, that whatever you ask will be heard. I then started thinking about how as Christians, or mild-believers, our tendency is to only go to God when we need something. We only pray for our friends when they are need. Why do we not lift them up in times of strength and peace asking for continued blessings? One of the greatest aspects of our Christian faith is that we are surrounded with others that believe as we do. They are there to lift us up, to encourage us, as we are to be there for them. There is much uncertainty in life. I think that God purposely makes life this way. It forces us to fully rely on Him, to 'lean not on our own understanding.' If we knew every turn that we would take in our lives, we may not ever reach our full potential, we would never be forced to face trials. We would never fully grow or be stretched. Life was not meant to be comfortable. We were meant to step outside of our comfort zones, to think outside of the box, so to speak. So I said all of that to say, prayer is important. Having friends that are like minded are important. I am thankful for every person that has ever prayed for me, every person who has ever influenced my life in any way, shape or form. I am glad that I don't always know where God is leading me. I am glad that sometimes I look ahead &amp; cannot see what is in store. I am also thankful that when I look back, God has always lead me to where I am standing now. I never have to fear what lies ahead, He is always with us, and He will never leave us or forsake us. "Serve God acceptably with reverence and Godly fear for our God is a consuming fire." -Hebrews 12:28-29

      From the Relevant Forum...  Read this Book: Politics for Dummies, or "The Good, the Bad and the Completely Ridiculous in American Life," by Bill O'Reilly.  Listen to this CD: FM Static, "Something to Believe In"; Barlow Girl, "Never Alone"; Big Daddy Weave, "Audience of One."  Watch this Movie: "Old School." -Sorry, I know its not intelligent, in the slightest bit. But its funny. And I like funny. "Blue Collar Comedy Tour." "Sabrina." -the OLD version, with Audrey Hepburn, and "Pillow Talk" with Doris Day. Anything with Cary Grant (An Affair to Remember, Philadelphia Story.) I like how classy everyone was back then. I may be old fashioned, out dated, whatever, but to quote Lauren Bacall in "How to Marry a Millionaire," "Gentleman callers must always wear a neck tie." -There is something great about men in suits who open doors &amp; women who act like WOMEN, not Men.

      What happened to people getting married and staying married, and more importantly, staying committed to each other? Has everyone on the face of the Earth forgotten their vows once they say "I Do?" I was watching Fox News this morning (as all good republicans do), and they did a story on websites that are catering to marrieds looking for dates.  They listed several websites, and there was one owner and operator of a website that actually admitted that he too cheated on his wife. I know that it may seem naive of me, but I'm an old fashioned kinda girl. Once I get married, I am hoping and praying that my husband will stay faithful to me, and that we will stay married, "Till Death Do Us Part..." I met a man this weekend who was in the middle of his second divorce. He had two children with both of his ex wives. He was only 34 years old, and extremely self centered. I was trying to read this man. He was not bad looking, by any means, but the way he carried himself was quite awkward. He said his second wife had cheated on him several times, but he still loved her. Well, I've never been in this situation so I can't really judge, but knowing my personality, it would have to be an act of God for me to stay with someone who did that to me, but is there a chance? I don't condone cheating on spouses, or significant others for that matter. But what the heck has happened to our society? The divorce rate is rampant, and on one website alone they listed over 160,000 members looking to cheat on their spouses. Something is extremely wrong with a society that would condone such behavior. In a recent poll taken, 50% of men and 40% of women cheat on their spouse. Which leads me to the question, why even get married in the first place?

      The anti-Bush/Cheney crowd is using the media as their force, as usual, to remind everyone that Dick Cheney told Patrick Leahy to "Go F--- Yourself." While I do not condone the usage of expletives, I cannot say that I blame VP Cheney. If I had the chance, I probably would have said it too. With that being said though, it is not cute or funny (well, maybe a little funny, in this instance) to swear at colleagues, or anyone for that matter. However, the media is comparing the Cheney quote to another campaign quote uttered from the other side, "Shove it." -Isn't that convenient? They've forgotten that their fearless (hopeful) leader, John F. Kerry used the F word himself just a few months ago. In a 'Rolling Stone Magazine' interview Kerry pandered to the "hipper, younger crowd of today's pop culture," by saying, ''I voted for what I thought was best for the country. Did I expect Howard Dean to go off to the left and say, 'I'm against everything'? Sure.  Did I expect George Bush to f - - - it up as badly as he did? I don't think anybody did ." At least Cheney's was said in a bit of a fit of rage. I think we all (or almost all) have uttered a few words we ought not to have when our tempers were a bit heated. But why would someone vying for a position as high as the President of the United States say it in an interview, so non-chalantly, as casually as a trucker at a rest stop would say it? It's simple. John Kerry is not cool. He rides his Harley, trying to act hip. He uses the F word, trying to sound hip. The fact is, he is not like any of us. Especially those of us in our mid-twenties and early thirties. He wants us to think he is hip, but the reality is, we almost all think he's boring as watching paint dry. Can any of us really relate to his life? He speaks in such a drone, I think the only way he could get the younger generations to pay attention to what he was saying was with the expletive. Of course the media has let this slide. They choose only to remind us of Cheney's short comings. Kerry is a political genius in their minds, and it is okay for him to swear. Once again the proof that the media is slanted to the left. Oh well, if this is the intelligence level that today's politicians are sinking to, we may be in trouble, or in for entertainment. Can you imagine what the next G8 Summit may sound like? Or even a meeting with the UN? Although, I think someone may need to tell Chirac and Schroeder to "Go F--- Themselves," it's not really the best way to get the respect we deserve or command the authority that we already have. Just my random thoughts for the day...
