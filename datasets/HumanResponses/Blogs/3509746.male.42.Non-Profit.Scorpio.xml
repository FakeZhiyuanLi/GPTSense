      Sometimes things change and it takes me a while to catch on. I flew into DC late the other night, and it hit me that the town has lost a lot of its mystery for me. Bush ambition to the contrary, It doesn't seem like the center of the universe. Instead, fittingly, it seems like an ordinary town somewhere in the middle of America.  First the airports: they close so early. I don't think I'll ever get used to landing at Dulles in the early evening - the place is a virtual ghost town at that hour. National is open a little later, but it still seems like I've just landed in Birmingham or Muskegan.  Second, the view from a taxi. There are many buildings and monuments of historical and architectural significance, but they're spread out - there's not a cohesive downtown feel like you find in great cities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, etc. Washington feels like a town that could have grown up, but didn't. I wonder why...

      Here in Georgia, we need to do a lot more work to make the state safe for democracy.  Proof in point: last night's GOP senatorial debate in Augusta.  On the dais, Republicans Herman Cain, Max Collins and Johnny Isaakson.  Each is anti- abortion, anti- gay marriage and pro- Patriot Act.  Given their shameful agreement on these topics, the candidates were forced to debate other issues, like political experience.  "I think that's part of the problem - political experience," Cain stated.  "The Titanic was built by experts and people with a lot of experience."  Collins, a veteran state lawmaker, pointed his finger elsewhere:  "This is no time to send someone [to the Senate] who is a moderate," he said.  Good thing all three candidates swear they are conservatives.  All the same, Isaakson, an experienced pol who used to be known as a moderate, was forced to reach for the corn pone as he tried to win over the audience.  "You're not going to find many Georgians in the right ditch or in the left ditch," Isaakson said with a bit of a southern twang.  "You'll find most of them in Wal-Mart."  Almost makes me want to move to Alabama.  Almost.

      Even if you've never been to Atlanta, you probably know about our abysmal rush hour traffic. Most locals take it in stride. But some take their relaxed attitudes too far.  As I drove home this (Friday) afternoon, I switched on the local public radio station just in time to hear the traffic reporter say, "top end perimeter (freeway) - all lanes blocked.  Apparently there's been a fatality."  Then, a full beat pause... and, brightly:  "That's one person who didn't make it into the weekend!"  Ouch.

      ...lucha por la justicia"  Pulling out of the drive-thru at McDonald's this afternoon, I saw a bumper sticker bearing the Spanish translation of Pope Paul VI's famous quote, "if you want peace, work for justice."    Headed back to the office, I got to thinking about my work... getting paid to do good.  Robert Egger, head of DC Central Kitchen, has cooked up quite a bit of controversy in the charity industry over the last few months by asserting (in his new book) that many nonprofit executives are what he calls "nonprofiteers" (more about this later, when I've read the book).  But even if the idea is a bit insulting, it has the ring of truth.  With so many people in DC and elsewhere propogating war and profiting from it, we need peace.  But how many of us are actually working for justice?  We want it, but we are distracted - by our own needs, agendas and prejudices.

      Why does the US government kill?  Because we give the okay.  Interesting commentary from a Gallup spokesman on CNN this morning.  He noted that if you ask people in the US if they favor capital punishment, more than two thirds respond that they do.  This is not a surprise.  What caught my attention was the fact that most death penalty proponents do  not  believe that the possibility of an execution prevents crime.  In fact, Gallup has found that support for capital punishment is usually about revenge.  Wouldn't it be great if "tough on crime" politicians who run election campaigns based on the death penalty were held accountable for their manipulation of voters' base instincts?

      From the latest Stanford Social Innovation Review - fresh from the postal carrier today:  "Charitable donors should think of themselves as 'investors' - and should expect returns, just like a stock market investor would.  But too often, givers don't see themselves this way, contributing to an inefficient 'social capital market.'  Increased efficiencies would benefit donors and nonprofits alike."  I couldn't agree more!  It starts with simple math: what are you buying, and how much does it cost?  Last year, I served on a panel that ranked proposals for federal funding.  As part of my work, I did the math, and the results were shocking - there was a huge difference between the cost of helping to transition a family from homelessness at different organizations. It was literally thousands of dollars more expensive for a person to become un-homeless at one organization than at others.  Why?  That agency was far less likely to  graduate  its clients: families tended to stay in the program longer, and most left only when they were kicked out for breaking rules.    It's a disgrace, really.  Huge amounts of money are spent to 'help' people by purchasing services from nonprofits that are inefficient at best, and ineffective at worst.  If individuals, foundations, the government, etc., were more savvy, they'd channel their donations to only the most effective organizations and help a lot more people without spending any more money.
