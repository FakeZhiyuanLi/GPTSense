						   Well, having narrowed the choices of homes down to three privately-owned halls, we're finding it's a race against time. One is full, one has only 40 places left (at the 6th largest university in the UK!) and the third has yet to call us back. Things don't look good, but as long as we're fairly close to each other it should be okay. As it is, we'll be looking around the remaining two on Monday, and probably making a decision immediately.  That's the main thing going on in my life right now. Been shopping for books for next year. Bit scary and [i]very[/i] expensive! I now have the money (from my Nan) for my laptop, which I should be buying in the next week or two.  If you are reading this, please post. I'd like to know.

						   As it, Sarah and I had applied for University-owned terraced houses. Unfortunately they were all full (we applied a little late). So now we're going through the booklets etc. for private halls and other such fun. A shame that our original choice didn't work out, but such is life. It's quite exciting looking through this stuff at where we'll be living next year.  If anyone is actually reading this, the University web site is  urlLink http://www.uclan.ac.uk .  That's all for now, just wanted to mention what's going on right now. See ya!

						   I, like so many others, want to be a (preferably bestselling) author. I have written the first few chapters of a story that's been in my head for years. When I was playing 'pretend' when I was in late primary/early secondary school, it was always the same character, Hermes, and later his seven companions. I began this story, but found that the range of characters were difficult (for me, at least) to put across without the page becoming crowded. Though I had reams of paper relating to this novel, I figured it might be better to try something a little easier, at least to begin with.  Therein lies my problem. I have a main character, Oliver, in mind. He is short, 5'5 to 5'9, with blond hair brushing his shoulders and a toned body (strong but not Olympic/Arnie level). Regardless, I've worked out that he doesn't believe in anything beyond the end of his nose. He is a journalist or writer or some sort and may well be an orphan. However, Oliver is oblivious to the preternatural world, which exists in common knowledge but not officially, yet is a part of it through his blood. I need him to be some sort of creature, yet I can't pin it. He can't be a vampire or lycanthrope, as the disadvantages of the species would have affected him by now. I'll think of something.  That's all for now. Have to pop off. See you soon!

						   In September I'll be a university student. I'll be studying English Language and Literature, but more importantly, my independence will be official and my budget will be my own. I figured it was time to being a blog. I've had diaries and journals before, both online and not. I tend to get bored after a while, but I'm determined to keep this one, even if it is just to help me write for the university magazine.  Okay, so my name is Andy. It's currently the middle of a sweltering August and I've visited the uni four or five times. The last was a "Flying Start" summer school, to introduce some of us newbies to each other, and to the official rigmarole which is required. Interesting in its own scary way, but the social side was fairly disappointing. Most of the social activities involved large amounts of drinking. "What's wrong with that?" I hear you cry. Nothing, per se, but Sarah, my partner/girlfriend/significant other/woman/chick etc. and I are not really people who enjoy being paralytic with complete strangers. I felt that the summer school was based upon the stereotypical students, who are far from the entirety of the population of the sixth largest university in the UK. Through a couple of the later activities and the lectures, we met a few people (mostly the older student "mentors") but not the lifelong friends suggested by one lecturer. This made me panic. I'm not a classically attractive person, though I am well known for being the clown, I haven't been popular in education so far. The last time I met new people wasn't the disaster the "Flying Start" turned out to be. At a post-GCSE university taster, I met and "clicked" with a dozen or more people. At least I'm not insecure, huh?  Okay, moving on, I enjoy vampires, be it books, movies (films to us Brits) or just interesting folk law. Gothicism and its styles are some things that interest me, though the more punky ways of gothy dressing are not my thing, I enjoy the original and classic images of goth in its flowing coats and formal attire. Anne Rice and Laurell K. Hamilton number amongst my favorite authors. A more recent interest is comic books. Yep, you heard me. I've recently gotten into reading (and collecting) graphic novels from a range of titles including Ultimate X-men; Preacher; and Batman. I enjoy the lightness in comparison with the novels I am more accustomed to. They are a relief in that way, but also consist of an entertaining and entirely underrated middle ground between the visual media of television and films, and literature. There is a freeness of not relying entirely on words, without the constant criticism of SFX and acting ability etc.  Okay, so day to day, I'm pretty much living with Saz and her mother in Sheffield, about ten miles from my home town (large village) of Goldthorpe. Having felt smothered by my Nan at home, and experiencing the liberation of city life over the last two years, it was a natural progression. We all get on well and cohabit comfortably.  There is more to me, honestly. I don't know who is reading this or why, but I'll post again soonish. Please leave a message if anything I've said has interested, insulted or in any other way affected you, and I'll see you soon.
