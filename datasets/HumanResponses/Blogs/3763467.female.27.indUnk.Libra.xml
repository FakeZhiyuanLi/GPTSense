      Some days i wonder what it is i am doing here...i see myself in the mirror and i think of the things in my life that i want to happen...the people that matter to me...and i wonder if they are really better off with me then without me..my kids i know would not be better without me......but people outside of my family.... take Josh..... I know he is a good man and i know he is a confused man... i know he hurts inside and i dont know how to help him....   here is the other thing,,,, i love josh with all my heart... and he says that he loves me too... but i have serious problems with his flirting.. he doesnt think its a big deal but it IS a big deal.. it makes me feel invisable... it makes me feel unimportant... like i dont really matter.. i mean if he is really happy with me then why should he feel the need to flirt......it doesnt make any sence...it frustrates me becuase he gets so mad when people take him wrong and then it gets blown up in his face and people try to come between us in the relationship but if he didnt flirt then it wouldnt happen,,,simple as that..... if some girl happens to smile at him and talk to him he needs to say up front,, "look..just to let you know from the start that i am happily with someone and i have no intentions of leaving her at any time." its what i do when i meet guys at the bar or online.... i know he doesnt understand it but it still hurts me every time he flirts,,,it hurts bad,,,,,  it may sound stupid but its how i feel..... i worry that he will meet someone more intiresing to him them me,,someone with more in common,,,, someone that is prettier then me,,more $$ and less baggage..... i dont knwo what to do anymore........i dont want to lose him to someone else and i dont want to worry about it eigther,,,, but i see him getting along with all these girls when we are online or at the bar and i see his eyes light up with the attention...and it just,,,,,scares me.........

      i have never loved as i love at this moment in time.... i have never felt what i feel with this man..... He is my heart ,,my soul,,he is a part of who i am. I came to meet him by chance and i came to love him by luck.... I thank god every day for him being in my life.... and i know we were brought together for a reason.... i keep telling him there is no one else for me and i mean that..... he is my match,,, my soulmate if you will.... i feel a connection with him that i cant explain.... and i understand him in ways that even he isnt aware of... the things that most people would take into acount and would turn away from him.... i accept and i deal with... i know the man that he is inside..even if he tries really hard to hide that from me...i see in his eyes the fear that he has when he looks at me.... and i also see the love..... the undying love that he holds so closely to himself...i understand his fears and i know he worries that he is giving himself to someone that will hurt him in the end...someone that will promise forever,,thick and thin..and then walk away when he needs them most........ but im not that person.... i am the one that is going to stand by his side through thick and thin and i am going to be here no matter how hard it gets... i am not going to abandon him or leave him alone when he is most scared..... i am that person he has searched for all his life,,that one true love he can count on.....and i will do what i need to do to prove that to him........ i will be his anchor when the ocean tries to take him adrift... i will be the paperweight that holds him down when he feels the wind try to carry him away... i will be the constant in his life that he needs..... and someday he will see that he doesnt need to fit in anywhere because he already fits in right here.... in my life and in my heart...... but until he is ready to do that on his own for his own reasons,,,his own choice.... i will stand by the man i love and i will do what i can to not get directly involved myself..... i know its hard for him to take the steps.....and i am not going to push for him to try to run where he can barely walk at this moment......its something that takes time......as all healing processes do........ as for me... i made a promise to love him for who he is... i made a promise to be here always,,,, i swore i wouldnt walk away when things got touph......and im not about to back out of my word,,,,, i love him......i cant even find the words to describe just how much he means to me,,,,,,,and im not willing to give up on him..... i dont care what anyone else says,,, i am an adult and i will make my choices just as anyone else would do..... i dont push for others to do things in thier lives my way or no way at all and i would hope that the ones that love me wouldnt do the same to me..... let me love him my way... let me help him my way...... let me live my life the way i want to live it...i want to be with him....thats all that i can say.....i want people to accept that and not hold that against me... i love who i love.... the heart knows what it wants and there isnt anything that can be done for that     i didnt ask to fall in love with him... it just happened,,,, but i am not about to walk away from him now that he is a part of me... that would be like living without a heart..... impossable.....

             I don't know what to do anymore and its frustrating.... on one hand i have my freinds... the people that have been here for me for a long time now.... and on the other hand i have Josh who is new to my life and my world. My friends dont care for Josh because of his beliefs and they dont think he is the person i should be with.... i understand thier side of things but in reality IM the one that has to make that decision... I know Josh has beliefs that are completly differant from mine,,,i know his beliefs go against our verry relationship... but the thing is,,if he doesnt care then why should i.... i know he has made mistakes by bringing a few parts around me that he shouldnt have but no one is perfect,,and you know what,, i need to take some responsibility for that too because i never said anything when it happened... when he brought in his flag ,, yeah,, he should have thought ahead of time and not done it,,, but in the same aspect i didnt say anything eigther so the blame is just as much mine.... as for the chat rooms that i was going onto... that was MY choice.. not his... HE didnt tell me to go there i did it on my OWN... the jokes i posted i did on my own... i know they were wrong but he isnt responsible... the thing is... i cant get sucked in if i dont let myself,,,and at first i was,,, but i saw what was happening and i backed up fast,, i felt dirty for what i almost did and i felt ashamed for what i had already done... but again those were MY mistakes.. not HIS......  then there is the whole matter of josh and Lincoln... Josh never asked me to take him,,,,,,, he never even brought it up,,,,, in all honesty,,,, I brought it up,,, and i offered to take him... not because i wanted him to go,,,, but because i wanted to know he was safe.... i had no intention of attending the function myself... i planned on hanging out at the mall for the 2 hours it consumes... but just knowing i was in the same town as him and knowing i was near by if something happened to him was a compfort to me... so when my best friend FORBID me to go...it upset me... im an adult and i feel it is my right as an adult to make my own decisions and my own mistakes..... so yes,,i made an even bigger mistake and i lied to her about it and was still going to take him.....but like all lies.... they find out the truth.... so naturally she was hurt by it.......  i felt bad for doing it..i really did,,,but it was already to late to take it back so what could i do..... and honestly,, i am an adult.... i dont forbid her to do the things that could be bad for her nor do i do that with any of my friends,, i let them make thier own choices,.... i may vioce my opinion but in the end,,it is thier choice.....    and here is what buggs me the most and hurts me more and more as i think about it......  i was told by my friends that they couldnt be my friends as long as i was with josh and he was in his group.......they said they couldnt stand by and watch me do this to myself,,that i had changed and i was withdrawn,,,,,,,,,that i wasnt the old christy i used to be,,,, here is the thing,,,my changes have nothing to do with Josh... people change of thier own accord,,not because someone makes them.....yeah i have been withdrawn and down in the pooper but it has little to do with Josh himself and more to do with other stuff.... im carrying a baby that i may  not be able to have.... i may lose a child that was concieved with a man i love verry deeply.... my bills are pileing up...im trying to get my divorce over with..... im trying to deal with the kids and the fact that there are changes that they arent dealing with very well but are learning to cope with... and i have health problems that are on top of it all..... health problems i cant deal with while im pregnant... so yeah,,im gonna be a little differant...wouldnt anyone?   My best friend said i should have an abortion so i can deal with my health issues.... but i cant do that.. i cant willingly and knowingly take that in my own hands,,,, it would kill me emotionally... and when i told her that she said that maybe her and my other friends needed to pray for me to lose the baby,,,that was like a knife in my heart........ i dont know how i would handle another loss,,,, i dont know that i could recover as i have in the past...... only so much can be put on a person before they crack.... i DONT WANT to lose this baby.... i want this baby more then anything not only because it is a living being.. but because it is a part of me and a part of Josh...my freinds can look at me and tell me that they dont believe all he says but in reality it doesnt matter what anyone else believes because IM the one that is in love with him,, not them..... has he lied to me?? maybe,,,, but i have no proof so why worry about it..... do i think there have been times he has said he was somewhere else when he was really doing something other?? maybe.... but i dont think its what THAY think,,.,, right away they go to "he's cheating". Where as i go to ,,, "he's doing something that has to do with his group and he isnt telling me because he knows i dont want to know".... and thats just it,,,, if he is passing out flyers or trying to recruit people,,,i dont want to know,,, i WANT him to lie to me about it...because then he is doing exactly what i asked,,,i told him i dont want to know anything about it..that i dont want to hear about it... that i dont want it around me.....and he has tried verry hard not to.... the times it gets brought around me other then the flag are because I asked a question or I said something about it,,, or I went to a websight,,,, he didnt force me to do any of it..it was my free will...and thats all i want in life is free will... i want to be able to love who i want to without the other people i love giving me altamatums,,, i dont want to have to put altamatums out there to the man that i love and want to spend my life with because my freinds dont like his beliefs,,, he has done nothing wrong to them,,, he held his tongue whith stacia at a time when i wouldnt have... he LIKES hanging out at nikki's with Judd and everyone and he respects judd for the man he is.... he even talks to people at the bar that normally he wouldnt ... he does what he can to respect those around me and i think he does a pretty good job,,,, i know he has made mistakes but hell we all make them..... i know its a phase he is going through,,, he is young and impressionable... i know that.... but i think that i also serve as an anchor that keeps him from going completly adrift... and i know how men are,,,ESPECIALLY Josh.... they dont like being told what they HAVE to do.... if you push hard they grab ahold harder... so by me saying "its me or that" its just gonna make him mad and he is gonna wanna embrase that all the more.....its a guy thing..its not logical,,,its just,,,male.     I put that out there for him... i told him that if he loved me he would walk away from the group,,,,and you know what?? i felt like a trator and like filth for doing it........ i hate those words..."If you love me"... its like blackmail to get what you want... i dont want him to leave that group just because i want him to and because i forced him to if he wants to keep me,,,, thats not right... i want him to leave it because HE wants to... as with anything in life.. you make choices for yourself not for others... just like me wanting to lose weight... anytime before it was for someone else i was trying to lose weight and it never did any good.... but the last 2 times i did...i lost weight,...and that's because i did it for me........ i want josh to make his own choices and i dont want to not be a part of his life while he does it... he is a part of me as much as my friends are....and i would never ask them to do what they have asked me to do..... i know Josh loves me.... he has shown it in ways that no one else sees... its not about giving up his beliefs,,, or spending every waking moment with me when he isnt at work..its about what he gives me when we are together.....the way he looks at me.... the emotion in his touch... how he is able to talk to me about things he cant talk to anyone else about,,,,the tears he cries in front of me when no one else is around to see...... the way he takes my stubborness and my mood swings and just lets them fly by and stays by my side even though i can be so hard on him and so cruel with my words.....If i were him i would have left my ass a long time ago... but he stays... and not because he is using me as some people might say....there isnt anything he is getting from me that he couldnt get elsewhere if he was just using me........ he stays because he loves me and because i love him..simple as that......and im glad i met him taht night..im glad i got to know him..im glad i fell in love with him.....    Yeah..i have my miserable moments.... yeah we have our fights... yeah there are things we dont agree on......... but tials and tribulations help you to grow..and we are growing....together..... i love him....to walk away from him would be like ripping out my own heart with my own hands,,,and i love my friends too.....they are as much a part of me as i am........ but i cant choose between them...and i wont........ its not fair to me to have to...... i am me..this is who i am,,, and i have things i have to deal with that are going to cause me to be depressed from time to time.... but they are just that..things,,and even without Josh in my life they would still be there...... and honestly,,without Josh in my life they would be worse..... if anyone thinks im depressed now,,or withdrawn now,,,,,,then you just keep pushing me to walk away from my heart,,becuase you will really see withdrawn and depressed then..... i cant explain what happened when i met Josh,,, i cant tell you that it was good timeing because the timeing probably stunk.... but the bigger picture is this....     every thing happens for a reason...and i honestly believe that Josh and i were ment to meet that day just the way we did..and that i was brought in his life at this time to help him realize his true potential.....but its not something that can be done over night...its something that takes patience and time......and i was slowly getting somewhere with him.............he was taking a step forward.... he had expressed things to me on several ocasions that made it clear i was getting through..MY WAY....... and then the bomb dropped and i was in a sence forced to push.....and now those steps have gone backwards and effected a relationship that means a great deal to me,,, i dont like seeing him lost....its like a small child that you are trying to show the way home...you get them to trust you and you start walking them home,,,but if you scare them,,they are going to shrink up and hide..............tell me how that is helping anyone????                   I love him.... and i love my friends....my life is incomplete without Sara...Anna,,,Nikki..Crystal..Stacia..Jamie...and even vince and sonja have made thier impact....... but its also incomplete without josh...so now what????      I have given in to my friends and i will not be taking him to lincoln this weekend.. instead he is leaving on friday morning at about 5 am and comming back on sunday sometime.....where as i will be at work from 10 am till 2 pm and then i will be comming home,,,showering..and meeting an old friend from my younger years that just moved back for dinner and a movie fallowed by more movies at her house.....and sturday we are gonna go bopping around and maybe browse the mall or just hang out and catch up on all the thime that has passed.... im hopeing that it will be a good distraction for me and that i wont spend a lot of time worrying about Josh.... i could go camping with Sara and them sat night but i dont know if i am ready to do that at this point... im still a little miffed at them for putting me in that situation..... I almost lost the baby friday night because they felt they needed to do thier little "intervention" and got me all worked up......my stress level went way too high and i started to go into labor at 2 months,,,,,, if i haddent gone into the hospital when i did this would be a whole differant journal entry...and i know that they were just "trying to help" but sometimes the best help is just letting people make mistakes........ i dont know if i am ready to deal with all of them in a camping environment at thie point.. i think i need more time to cool down and to get over the heartache that im feeling at this time... thats why i chose to spend time with Stacie...she hasnt been a constant in my life..she hasnt been someone i trust in years...so if she lets me down its no big deal to me..if she decides to not be my friend its no big deal to me.....she is my safety zone because i dont care what she thinks or how she feels about the man i love..... and i know she wont lecture me on him or make me chose sides.......
