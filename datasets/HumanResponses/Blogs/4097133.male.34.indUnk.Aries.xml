      So, here I am.  First post.  Nothing to say.  I suppose I could recycle things I've said in the past, but not right now.  I find myself wondering about the etiquette of blogging.  I'm sure it's mostly stream-of-consciousness stuff, but are there unwritten rules?  Is proper grammar frowned upon?  Good spelling?  Shrthnd?  No time right now; the 5 year-old terror is awake and demanding my attention, so I'll hop back at some point in the future.  Or not.  Bleah.

      Colin Quinn is funny perhaps 1 joke out of 4.  The past two nights of Tough Crowd have included his terribly painful "Celebrity Hat Party" clips.  Hoo boy.  I do like, however, the fact that race is a BIG issue on the show.  Anything related to race appears to be okay to talk about, and that's refreshing.  No holds barred, no matter how intelligent (or not) the conversation is, is always my preferred venue for a current events-type program.  Okay, tired now.

      My son is splashing around in the tub, saying "Mama Mama Mama Mama Mama....." over and over.  He's been doing it for the past five minutes.  I can hear in his voice that he's not in any pain or distress.  I'm wondering how long he can sustain it.  Children are amazing to me.  They have such stamina and will.  "Mama Mama Mama Mama Mama....."

      12 hours of work, with no real break.  Contract rate or not, enough is enough.  Screw you guys, I'm going home.

      The people in my neighborhood seem very concerned with screeching their tires in the middle of the night in order to put as much rubber smoke in the air as possible.  I'm sure they're all very "patriotic" and "love theUSA" without really knowing what either of those mean.  I love my country and the ideas upon which it was founded, but I hate the current administration.  I'm hoping for a change (preferably for the better!), and am looking to the Democratic party for that change.  However, NO political party is saying everything I want to hear.  Yes, I'm for a secure America, but not at the expense of ANY of our civil liberties.  Yes, I'm for creating jobs in America, but NOT at the expense of the poor people in India and elsewhere that we're employing now.  Yes, I was for the war in Iraq, but NOT because of "weapons of mass destruction" (Hussein and his regime were killing his own people, and for that reason only, we had to go).  And I firmly believe that if our stated mission is to go after terrorists just because they're terrorists, that means we should go after ALL of them, not just the ones who attacked the United States.  The funny thing is, most of the people I meet aren't afraid of Al Qaeda because they're terrorists; the fact that they are Muslims (extremely radical though they are) seems to give Americans a kind of subconscious permission to let their bigotry and racism rise to the surface as fear.  I'm no more afraid of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil than I was on September 11, 2001, or on March 11, 2004 (Madrid bombing), but that's probably because I wasn't blind to the possibility of it, the way many of my fellows appear.  I know the world in general has mixed feelings about the United States, admiring us and hating us to varying degrees at the same time, and I hope that the next group of world leaders can work on changing the ways we see each other and work together.  Cheers.
