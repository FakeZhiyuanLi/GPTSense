      Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. My lousy efforts paid off. The tests were....easy. Haha.  Well i still have another paper tomorrow... Gotta get back to mugging soon... Sian!  Today was okay la. Went to school. Did the tests and took a new route back home. Met jason & zh at on the way and went to have budget dinner with them at KFC. Saw some secondary school juniors. I'm surprised how much they've remain unchanged, but well, it's only been like a year or so... mabye because the past few months felt like years to me, especially the transition of higher learning and the change of so many rules and routines.  Urghhhhh... I'm typing like 5LPM(Letters per Minute). Lol.. I don't really want to leave this keyboard and..and...............................get back to study. Okay ENDURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S DA LAST DAY TOMORROW! OKAY BYBYE FOR DA MOMENT.   - The heart can only get wearier -

      Arghhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Just managed to cram every little detail of the shit i'm supposed to study into the BRAIN. The test is tomorrow!!!!  Haizzzz. Totally sian-ed mood. Today felt like hours shorter than average days. Mabye because i seriously got down to work since a long time ago. Went to Yew Tee McDonald's with de wang to study and walked around in Lot1 for like an hour after the revision. I'm surprised to see so many familiar faces on the streets today... It's like everyone's busy or something. Arrghh i really need that extra bit time!!!!! But luckily i think i'm still on track so far... or am i?  Well i hope i won't be pulling the longest face on earth after the tests tomorrow... It is definitely going to spoil the rest of the damn week. And IF the long-face phenomenon did occur, most probably i will mug through DA DAMN WEEK... to clear my guilt of insufficient preparations for the tests.  Hais i'm like multi-tasking for the whole day. Studying and.. thinking of you - especially when that song plays...    "I'll spread my wings and i'll learn how to fly. I'll do what it takes till i touch the sky. I'll, make a wish, take a chance, make a change and breakaway..."

      Been all so down and gloomy these days. I don't know really know what's going on la... Messed up everything. Now i don't even own the chance of talking to you normally like a friend.  It's hard.  I wanna let you know how i feel yet i don't want you to treat me like something non-existent.. something you hate or detest. But..ah forget it. Who am i to say all these. Who am i to decide.. it's your life.. You decide. I find it sometimes so tormenting to simply like someone.  _____________ hais.   - I am always either behind time or fatally ahead of time.....always.
