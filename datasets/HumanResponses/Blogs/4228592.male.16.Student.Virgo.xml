      People do not just have faith, they have faith  in someone or some thing. Faith is not subjective, but objective. There was onve a good woman who was well known among her circle of friends for her simple faith and her grear calmness in the midst of many trials. Another woman, hearing about her from a considerable distance, said, "I must go and see this woman, and learn the secret of her calm and happy life." She went, and as she approached the woman, she said, "Are you the woman with the great faith?" To this question the woman replied, "No, I am not hte woman with a great faith, but i am the woman who has a little faith in a great God." Thus, our faith is only as good as the object of that faith. We might have faith in ourselves and fail, we may have faith in another and be disappointed, but when our faith is centered in the Almighty God, We shall not be confounded. The Bible tells us that Abragam believed God, and this faith was counted unto him for righteousness. Put your faith in the unfailing God.

                 Hi!      It's around 11:00p.m right now and after reading some of my friend's blogs ive decided to just write  a profile on myself to let u know what kind of person i am.            My name is marshall martin and i was raised up the small town of Aynor. I like playing soccer, baseball, pingpong, skiing, and ocassionally tennis. I think im a nice guy and smart at times.           You see i have my problems in life as well, and one of them deals with a loving, and cheerful girl to whome i would like to appologize to for breaking her heart in the past. Believe it or not, but she was the first girl that i ever really loved. She has shown me things in the past that changed my life in a few different directions.             Since the day that we broke up, i fill  that we have come to learn about a new understanding in life about love, feelings for people, and what it means to have someone special in ur life. Iv'e been thinking for the past couple months about what kind of relationship i need to look for, and i have sort of an idea but thats what u need God for; to talk to him and ask him for help.          Ive prayed and asked God to show me the way in which i should go and i'll let him lead my life from here. Ive put my faith in Christ and at times have wondered if its made a difference in my life and ive found out that life just doesn't go as u plan it, u need a guiding hand to lead u in the right direction. Have U ever asked God to help u with a problem in ur life?
