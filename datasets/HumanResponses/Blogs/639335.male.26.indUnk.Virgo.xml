      Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them.   The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Mark Haddon

      Is liberation and self awareness, realising that I have the capacity to hurt someone advertently and not feel guilt about it? Is our conscience our Limiters as in Xenogears, the genetic code implanted in us, not to go against our creators, not to have the strength to match them, to have an uncontrollable fear of them, that we whimper at their feet? Guilt. It used to last longer. This time, it lasted for just half a day. The first ten minutes were the most intense but it slowly faded, while my Gears were tearing the Angels apart. Amazingly, no insomnia, I slept with minimal interuptions. The next day, I didn't feel a thing. Actually, I did feel something. A strange cheeriness, my savings had increased by a thousand and I have more time to do my research. What happened to my conscience? It used to be strong, it used to dictate my moods and my inactivity. Where has it gone to?  Am I free?  Or have I just been playing too much Xenogears and reading Fight Club?

      You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everyone else, and we all part of the same compost pile.  What you have to consider, he says, is the possibility that God doesn't like you. Could be, God hates us. This is not the worst thing that can happen.   Maybe because God's hate is better than His indifference.    Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club

      After Tyler and Marla had sex about ten times, Tyler says, Marla said she wanted to get pregnant. Marla said she wanted to have Tyler's abortion.  You know, the condom is the glass slipper of our generation. You slip it on when you meet a stranger. You dance all night, then you throw it away. The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.  This is why I loved the support groups so much, if people thought you were dying, they gave you their full attention.    Fight Club , Chuck Palahniuk

       urlLink     Had a good dinner with friends. Most people consider cooking a chore, for me, its an interest, a passion and there's nothing more that I like than to cook something for friends or family. Anyway, for the meal, as you can see from the pictures above, I have a braised lamb chop dish, a bit too strong, the taste of lamb, for my palate, i will have to look into spices, to mask the taste of the lamb itself. The other two dishes are, lemon chicken and stir fried beef and lettuce. For a closer look, just click on the picture itself.

      Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.  Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

      Results day was yesterday and the fates of a certain number of Singaporean men and women was determined by a (I would say) complex mathemathical equation, a degree classification that demarcates between a second upper (or some may ponder upon, a upper second) and a second lower. I have taught, almost all of these Singaporeans, in an official capacity, as a tutor of one of the third year modules and some, individually, I have taught, as a friend and after all that, I know, I like to teach, I like to interact with students, to educate them, not so much on the subject matter itself but on how to think with flexibility and not the rigidity, we see in Singapore education. Although, I suspect, the lesson is lost on most and oddly, the ones who learn, are the ones who already possess that flexibility, so I can't really say that I have taught her. Anyway, I am happy for her, NM, for writing such a wonderful piece of academic writing, for convincing me that some Singaporeans can actually think. It was a pleasure reading your dissertation and I honestly, feel you deserve the marks and the grades you got. I hope academia is the route for you and that, one day, we can collaborate on something:)  Congrats NM.

      Watched Bad Education yesterday. I was impressed with Pedro Almod√≥var's All about my mother, a powerful narrative of a mother and the anguish she feels at losing her only son and how she comes to terms with it, with her relationship with her ex-husband, a transsexual and a nurse, he infected with Aids and so, I was hoping that Bad Education, would be equally stimulating, well, I wasn't too disappointed, it is good, despite a complex narrative, a movie within a movie, a normal chronological flow and the numerous flashbacks of the characters in question; which makes for confusing viewing at times, when you can't figure out who is who, especially when the characters share the same names at times. It is this narrative structure that disrupts the general pace of the movie but still, i enjoyed the movie, tremendously, for the story itself.  Sexual identity has always been part of his movies, but never integral to the plot itself, homosexuals and transsexuals are normalised such that, they become merely characters; they are not the other, they are simply one of us, and the plot flows without their sexual orientations, disrupting or influencing the direction of the movie. His stories are simplistic, nothing spectacular, but somehow, they impact upon your senses, not because of their originality but because of how real, how well fleshed out, the characters are; Father Manolo and his obsessive thrist for the siblings, now and then, not just a corruption for his own sexual gratification but oddly, truly, love, the mystery that is Juan, why he did what he did and yet did what he did and Enrique, righteous yet exploitative, they are paradoxes, everyone of them, but so imperfectly, human, you feel a certain intimacy with them, and so, the story, it feels as if its narrated to you by a friend, and you can almost imagine it happening to you, a distinct possibility.   To me, thats the main reason why I like his movies

      Alcohol makes me insomanic. I was extremely fatigued after the bbq and at 1am, i was drifting off, at least an hour in advance of my normal sleeping time. But oddly, I didn't fall asleep, or rather I hovered between sleep and a strange limbo state, where I could not see but I could hear everything around me, people mumbling outside my flat, my flatmate returning from his drinking bouts, the slam of the door, footsteps, everything and at 3am, I woke up, completely awake, irritable and extremely bored. I came online for a while, checking out basketball news, (Lakers lost, fucking hell)played on the ps2 nba live 2004, hoping that I will drfit off in the process, but to no avail, and I just laid on my bed. The sun came up at around 4am, irritating me tremendously, i had to draw the curtains tight, together so as to prevent the light from coming in, i could stop the light but i could not stop the incessant chirping of the birds outside my window. So i continue lying them, smsing to people at 5am to inform them of my insomnia, to make a personal connection? I don't know. I think i managed to doze off at around 6am, but of course, sleep is never prolonged in my situation, I woke up at 940am, at 10 plus and finally at 1114 am, before I gave up looking for sleep.   Sadly I had to go to the office, to submit my panel review forms, and so I had to leave the house, even though, i could feel the weight of weariness bearing down on my head. And it is odd, I am starting to feel hyper from the lack of sleep.

      I don't eat much at BBQs, come to think of it, I don't eat much at any social occasion, at a relative's house, at a law dinner, formal dinner in school, of course, I don't exactly go out that much for social functions as well. I was having a bbq at HS hall, my dvd kaki lives there and since he is graduating this year, some of his hallmates threw a going away bbq for him. He invited me along for it. Food was okie, a bit bland, seasoning wasn't done that well, i had a total of one stick of chicken chunks, a sausage and a chicken drumstick. Amazingly, i wasn't that hungry but then again, perhaps it wasn't that surprising, a small amount of food is enough to sate my hunger; a combination of a low carbohydrate diet and age? Older people tend to eat less. Company was fine, I was talking mostly to the students from China, about phds, master and education, in general. Had a good talk with this tutor from China, she's doing a phd on George Humbert, some 17th century poet in the same era as John Donne, was talking to her about Sylvia Plath, she doesn't exactly like her because she thinks she's unstructured and unrefined, Joseph Heller, Raymond Carver and Charles Bukowski, she didnt know that Carver wrote poetry but then again, Carver's poetry is pretty much the same as his prose, she doesn't know Charles Bukowski, she doesn't know Edna St Vincent Millay. Then we went on to Canadian authors, she mentioned someone i didn't know, but I told her about about Douglas Coupland, my current favourite author and she seems interested in him. Interestingly, she asked me whether I wrote and I told her, yea I do, I grinned, something along Plath's style. Spoke to D for a while, about what its like to be an academic and listened to him for quite some time, about his tales of hall, very interesting stuff, things that can happen in hall, murder, suicide, accidents,its enough to write a book.  All in all, it was a pretty good night. I guess its good largely because i can talk to people on a largely intellectual level; and not just empty social talk. Going to watch Ichi the Killer tomorrow and Bad Education on tuesday.

      Having a quiet weekend, in striking contrast with the last few weekends I have had, trips to London, splurging on mussels and lobsters, (you would have imagine that since England is an island, seafood should be abundant and cheap but sadly, thats not the case., watching musicals, stoning at Borders and copying recipes from cookbooks or people visiting me in Notts and I will give them the Notts tour, not that there's much to see, but for people with money to spend on shopping, its not too bad an experience and of course, there's good food, good french food. To me, a holiday wihtout good food, isn't a holiday at all, and thats probably why, i am not exactly looking forward to SL's visit at the end of the month. Well, the weekend has been quiet, just me, the ps2, phone calls with M and Mom, testing out new recipes and of course, All families are psychotic, extremely readable, and excellent insights made about life.   For once in a long time, I am enjoying solitude.

      "The biggest change is that I stopped believing in the future - which is to say, I stopped thinking of the future as being a place, like Paris or Australia - a place you can go to.  I started believing that we're all going, going, going all the time, but there's no city or place at the end. We're just going. That's all."  "When Ted left her and she had the house to herself, she thought she was going insane, in the medical sense, with boredom and loneliness. She could put a good face on it - she knew that - but her days became quests to find someone, anyone, to connect with... Ultimately, it was on the internet where she could meet with people and not have them instantly sppoked away by the look of near - surrender in her eyes."

      When I am functional, there is no need to write in the other blog. There is no compelling urge to blog about my life and the shit that it entails at times. For the first time, in a while, i can feel a strange inner calm. Its like my voice of reason, and there really is such a voice has revived, and I can hear him speaking, clearly, enunciating every single word with the pronunciation that I possess. I can hear him these days. Gone is the other voice, the voice, voiceless. When things happen, I can think, clearly, rationally, and decide upon my actions. Sadly, this may alienate me from certain individuals, because that voice tends to be cold and calculated but this is me. This is me, when the turmoil inside has calmed down, this is who I am when I am not feeling unhappy about my life. I wouldn't say I am happy, its too early to say that yet. But for now, I am functional and thats enough. I guess when I am functional, my blogs will be functional, as the bear puts it intellectual crap. I guess thats why, this blog is back.  Went to the second hand bookstore again, bought Douglas Coupland, All families are pyschotic, I have been meaning to get hey nostradamus but never did get down to it , because I figured I could afford to wait for it to appear at the second hand book store after all, Monica Ali's Brick Lane is already, though, i am quite sure I won't go anywhere near it, I am tremendously bored of cultural identities, how a displaced can find his or her place, too many Joy Luck Clubs and the Woman Warrior and Toni Morrison. But yes, All families are psychotic. What really caught my attention was the phrase,   "suicidal Bryan is due to arrive any moment with his vowel-free girlfriend, Shw."  Vowel free. Quirky indeed.

      After applying for a Resident Tutorship at six halls of residences and rejected by all six of them for numerous reasons, the first four, being a crap cover letter and cv and last two, inexperience, the search for private accomodation was on. Thankfully, today, tuesday, I have found my accomodation for the next year and hopefully my entire phd here.   So thats one thing off my mind, finally, I can get on with my research.  And, yes, finally, I can feel excited about going home. Yes, I am going home in two weeks' time!

       urlLink      All of a sudden, my room is full. I spent 10 months, trying my best not to accumulate too much material possession for fear of the day of reckoning- the great shift beyond, and somehow, my room is filled with electronics. I am now the proud owner of a dvd player, a digital radio, two speakers and a large cd player. All because my friend could not sell off these stuff and I am now the lucky recipients of all the unwanted and unsold. These are the times, the rare times, when I actually wished that I could drive and that I had a car so that I can bring my things to my next abode. Interestingly, with the amount of money I get a month, and the price of automobiles here, I think I have a decent chance of getting a servicable vehicle without blowing a hole in my pocket. In Singapore, you need long term planning and possibly investment to get that all important symbol of status. Here, its just shopping at the nearest Motorworld. M wants me to drive and I guess I might actually learn driving the next academic year. For now, I am trying my best to get a room somewhere close to my current premises.   Lower Road. Please let me have a room at Lower Road
