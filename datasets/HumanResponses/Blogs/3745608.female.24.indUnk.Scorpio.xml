      Such an issue is being made of bloggers and our capabilities as writers and the pull we have on the world's literature and blahblahblah.  So it was interesting to read  urlLink an article  about how bloggers butchered their opportunity at the Democratic National Convention. I have said, and will still say, that bloggers read bloggers who read bloggers, ad infinitum.  My blogging friends are all within a Six Degrees of Separation type of circle.  Links are put up and followed and re-linked and followed.  The circle of people I know is obviously much different than the circle of people who went to the DNC.  Or the people who will probably be attending the RNC.  We're all mostly former diarylanders or former livejournalers.  We're mostly twenty-somethings, most of us are married.  At the same time, now that I think about it, we're all pretty different.  We're from all of the time zones in America, probably.  We're Republicans and Democrats.  We like country music and Brit Pop and Sanrio and TWoP. We all at least know  of  each other.  And we wouldn't without our common denominator of blogging.  We wouldn't care who the other was, BFFs would remain anonymous to each other, probably only being recognized by first names or initials if we weren't all pouring some part of our lives into the Wide World of Blogging. So you'll have to pardon the world, I guess, if they don't stand up and take notice, y'all.  Even if you are at the DNC.

      Something really! amazing! is fixin' to happen to me in the next couple days.  I wish I could write about it, but there are spies.  You know who you are, you know what you say.  Shame on you. I'm eating a peaches & cream muffin from Perkins, and for some reason everything seems to be okay. It's the last day of billing, so everything is crazy and busy here at the old World Headquarters.  But I'm emailing with my BFF emailers, and again, everything is okay. I am on the verge of being happy.

      We are finally divided.  We are backed up against opposite walls of the gym, staring each other down wondering who will be the first brave one to step to the half-court line and start dancing.  But no one will, because meeting in the middle is an abstract, scoffed at, assinine thought right now. It's unfamiliar to us, because for so many of us, we have never really had to choose.  We've been happy standing in the middle duck-duck-goosing our way through things.  Duck - no, I don't believe in that.  Duck - no, I would never agree to that.  Goose - yes!  Finally, we have something in common! But now we're being forced to pick a team.  We're shirts or skins, red or blue, girls or boys.  We are one or the other.  We are Republican or We are Democrat.  We love W., or we love Kerry.  We agree with the war, or we don't.  We support gay marriage, or we think it is a crime against the sanctity of an outfit which hasn't been sacred since well, SINCE...?  We are Michael Moore, or we are Ann Coulter. And nevermind all  you  us moderates who have always been happy to be in the duck-duck-goose world.  Who have been happy to say YES, more gun control, but also, YES I am pro-choice.  YES, I agree with the legalization of gay marriage!  And, YES, build up our military, defend us and those who need defending!  No longer can we do that, my friends.  Moderacy is out; polarization is in. So pick a side!  Who will it be?  What will you find to be the most important issue?  Who will it be!  What is  wrong ?!  WHO WILL IT BE!  The days of quietly standing in the middle of the road have passed for now.  It is now time to let your vote be branded across your forehead. Are you ready to pick one?

       I had an entire post here about how much I despise my ex-boyfriend.&nbsp; And I seriously do.&nbsp; I'd go so far as to say he ruined part of me, but he didn't.&nbsp; I think he just kicked the shit out of a part of me, and that part is still in a coma somewhere.&nbsp; But it will be back and I'll be done hating him.  Lauren and I went to see  urlLink Matt Nathanson  Saturday night.&nbsp; He played with  urlLink Howie Day and  urlLink O.A.R. .&nbsp; (The linking thing on blogger is quite possibly the most annoying thing I have ever experienced in my entire life.&nbsp; REALS.)&nbsp; Howie Day.. I'm still kind of blah about him.&nbsp; I think his studio albums are actually better than his live stuff.&nbsp; I will say that from a musician standpoint, he is almost unequaled.&nbsp; He is completely amazing on the guitar.&nbsp; But from a working-the-crowd standpoint?&nbsp; I think my grandma just died, and that is going to garner more attention.   OAR were awesome, though.&nbsp; I like how all their fans are hard core hippies and just want to dance and be high together.&nbsp; And how OAR are always like "Oh man, be BFFs and the world will rule!"  And then!&nbsp; Matty Nay Nay.&nbsp; Oh man.&nbsp; I don't think any of you, with the exception of Lauren, understand my unabashed LOVE for Matt.&nbsp; He is on par to be my tied-with-Counting-Crows-favorite!&nbsp; He rules in concert, is totally hilarious, and took a picture with us with our family hand sign!&nbsp; Oh man.&nbsp; I love him hard core.

      Uncle: I have bad news, Sara. Sara: Oh no. Uncle: Gned the gnat is dead.  (guh-ned the guh-nat) Sara: Oh no!  Who would kill Gned? Uncle: Well, he was in the potty this morning when I got here.  I thought about CPR.  But then I peed on him and flushed it. Sara: Oh man. Poor Gned.

      Obviously I can appreciate the humor of  urlLink Rock, Paper, Saddam  because my family and I play RPS to decide EVERYTHING.  Usually the best time to play RPS, or so we've found, is when deciding which team should go first when playing  croquet .  Obviously my fat family and I hate sports, so we play games like croquet.  And the occasional round of kickball wherein the "kickball" is one of the 4-foot-in-diameter-beach-balls.  My family has the best games ever.

      I may or may not be back long term.  I can't decide if blogging is where I'm at any more. It would sort of be a shame if it wasn't 'cuz I've been doing this for close to four years.  (The 23rd of July is 4 years exactly, as a matter of fact.) I have the biggest bruise ever on my arm right now from constantly slapping myself whilest trying to kill The Hugest Gnat Ever.  Apparently even when you're a fat gnat you're faster than I am. I had a great 4th of July weekend filled with family & food.  I spent a good portion of the weekend with one or more of my cousins.  It was also family photo time.  And as soon as I can, I'll be putting some pictures up.  Including pictures of my nephew and his first birthday! Before I forget, the dude on  urlLink Jeopardy!  right now is my all-time favorite contestant there ever.  (Excluding Celebrity Jeopardy! on SNL, which has Ozzy Osbourne as my favorite character.  "Choose?  All-right!  I'll take Charleston Chews for sixty millions!")  Yesterday dude won his  25th consecutive game .  He's now at $788,960 in winnings.  I think I love him & want to be his BFF.  (There are other articles about him all over the 'net.  He's the boss of game shows.) So.  Blogging?  I'm not so sure about you right now.

       urlLink Dear X:  Thank you for the gifts you unknowingly gave me. I am happy we finally had the opportunity to hang out.  We drove downtown and I can't even recall the number of people who would stare at your car as we drove by.  I fell in love with your console, even as you were pounding on the keys of your stereo saying, "The radio doesn't work!"  I found it funny that you would pour thousands of dollars into your car just to have a factory-installed radio that doesn't work.  You talked to me about the blahblahblahs and the whozzits that you were going to install, and I looked at you and said, "You could have just made up a bunch of words and I wouldn't have known the difference."  You said, "I did," and we laughed. We went back to my apartment where we played Tiger Woods and Pac-Man.  Eventually you refused to play any more, and rested your arm on the back of my couch.  I settled against your chest, and the rest of that night is pretty much history. Later we watched Street Smarts and Toy Story.  I asked you a thousand questions, and you never hesitated answering any of them. You stayed 'till five the next evening.  We sat around all day and watched TV and made fun of the dog. I haven't really spoken with you since.  You and your family moved out last week, and you didn't stop by to say bye.  I'm okay with that, to tell you the truth.  I didn't need anything more than a kiss on the cheek as you were breezing out the door. I doubt I'll ever see you again, and I know we'll never have another night of laughter and TV.  But I wanted to thank you for the gifts you gave me.  Mostly, thanks for the gift of moving on.  If it hadn't been for you, I'd probably still be curled up in my bed, crying over something that never was what I wanted it to be anyway.  Instead, I think I might be in love.  I saw a quote the other day that said "You might as well love someone while you're searching for someone to love."  And I did.  Being tangled in your arms and in my blankets was enough for me to kick one really bad memory to the curb.  Thanks for helping me move on.  Thanks for reassuring me of my worth and my beauty.  I hope I reassured you of yours. Love, Sara

      Dear  urlLink Danny : Today I found the card you sent me one year + five days ago.  I read it and remembered being completely crushing on you.  And maybe a smidge in the love. I am so thankful for you, and for the fact that you make me  work my ass off  to be your friend.  Working for your friendship means I never, ever take you for granted. I am thankful that you are honest with me, and that you get  honestly  pissed off if I cross a line with you.  I know better now than to talk crap about your girlfriend or your car or your mom's vagina.  (Although in my defense on that last one, I  did  say it was a high performance machine.)  I love that you are the hardest person to get to know ever.  And I love that you're totally the coolest about writing me drunk letters. I love you so much, my friend. Sar

      One of the few things that I still do that I used to do with  Matt  is watch  Arsenal  games and follow Arsenal news.  I don't claim to know as much as he does, because even now I hardly ever remember to catch anything on Fox Sports World.  But I know that I hate ManU, and that Henry is one of my favorite athletes of all time. I see Gunner fans all the time now.  I used to  SWEAR  that Matt was the only person in Colorado who would wear Arsenal jerseys.  Everyone laughed because probably 90% of the time dude was wearing something Arsenal related.  But I see Arsenal fans now and almost always say "DUDE!  GO GUNNERS!"  And they get very excited. Sometimes I allow myself good memories.

      [This is a variation on the Dear X idea.  This month I will be writing a letter from someone to me.]  urlLink Dear Sara:  I've known you all your life.  You have always been my sister, and my father's daughter.  Although you think I am better than you are, I consider you wonderful.  I sing your praises and love you through everything. I hear you praying to me every day and every night.  I see you raise your hands up in the car and belt out praise & worship songs to me and our Father.  I know you are trying to be like me, and everyday I think you're becoming a bit closer to the person you want to be. I believe in you.  I know you are not sinless or perfect, and I don't expect you to be.  You are human.  You are forgiven. I died on the cross for you.  I took all of your sins and sickness and anger and temper with me.  I rebuked the asthma in your lungs, and the depression in your brain long before you were born.  You don't have to be a slave to them.  I bore your wounds so you wouldn't have to.  I know you imagine everyday what it will be like to meet me.  It will be like it always has been for siblings -- wonderful.  Thank you for preparing to meet me. Continue to spread the word.  Be a crusader for what you believe in; your reward will be great.  Teach love and patience and respect.  I am with you always. I love you. -X PS: Your Nana knows you still sense her sometimes.  She loves you.

      I've spent approximately 48 hours looking at  urlLink Found .  And it reminded me of the most scarring moment of my childhood.  I'm pretty sure I am not ready to talk about it as it involves A) My mom, and B) Oral sex.
