      Obviously I have the day off today and have nothing better today than look at old meet photos and laugh.  I chose a few that I wanted to post - and no, I promise I won't put yet another one of Jason ;)  Here ya go:   CAN1 - Ottawa   Jason grinding Will with a baguette.  I wish I had a photo of the bus pole grinding... or the video of him chasing me down the Rideau Centre with that baguette!    The guys in their boxers at Double Deckers pub.       CAN2 - Toronto   Jake & Russ show us there is no IN and OUT privileges with them!    Phil and Joey get into some heavy statue snogging!    Ahh some of these I almost forgot about :)

      If you're coming from abroad and are planning to fly into/out of Castlegar from/to Vancouver then you'll need to check out the flight schedules.  The daily flights are limited as they need to see the mountains in order to land.  These are all on Air Canada.  Once Northern Hawk Air releases their fall schedule to Trail, I will post them as well.  Here they are:   VANCOUVER-Intl - YVR to CASTLEGAR (BC) - YCG   Departure Times : 8:15 am, 11:45 am & 3:30 pm    CASTLEGAR (BC) - YCG to VANCOUVER-Intl   Departure Times :  9:55 am, 3:30 pm & 5:10 pm	   If you are planning to come on a weekend, it is likely that the early morning flight is not available.  Please keep in mind that these are DH1 and DH3 type aircrafts as well :)   In addition, unless you are flying Air Canada from Europe and are booking all the way through to Castlegar, you will have to go through International Customs at Vancouver and collect your baggage.  Then you will have to go to domestic departures and check-in again.  I've done this MANY times before with only an hour to spare so it is definitely possible. Typically, I will use YVR's  urlLink Express Check-in  kiosks and then hand over my baggage.  Alternatively, if you don't want to rush, you can either hang out in Vancouver for a night and fly to Castlegar the following day *OR* look at doing an overnight bus ride on  urlLink Greyhound .  Honestly, though, the cost of the flight vs. the cost of the bus is almost the same.

      So I had this question posed to me today.  And really, the answer, is quite simple - I don't really care.  I don't think Adam/Fire really cares either :)  You have to understand that we have jobs we'll have to go to, so if that isn't a big deal to you and you want to stay an extra week or so, then feel free.  I think the longest someone stayed at my place at the last meet was 3 weeks :)  For those of you who are wary about meeting people from the WEEEEB, here is a funny little comic that portrays how people are online versus realife:   urlLink     Teehee!  Click it for a bigger version :) But really - its going to be a blast.  So stop your humming and hawwing and sign up already!

      So I figured I would do a bit of research and find out what sort of prices people should expect for flights.  Here are my results:  - Vancouver to Castlegar, return, on  urlLink Air Canada  fluctuates between $299 and $320 CAD.  If you are going to book this flight, please keep in mind that there are only 3 flights per day. - Vancouver to Trail, return, on  urlLink Northern Hawk Air  is roughly $368 but this could change after Labour Day once they publish their new fall flight schedule. - London Gatwick to Vancouver, return, on  urlLink Canadian Affair  works out to 338 GBP.  I chose a UK departure of Oct 7 and return flight of Oct 14.  If you chose this option you'd also have to get the above flight from Vancouver.  Alternatively, you can fly from London Gatwick to Calgary for 337 GBP (Ooooooh) and then hook up with Camerak in Calgary.  You'd have to work out driving dates, etc with him though. - Charlotte, NC to Seattle, WA, return, on  urlLink Travelocity  works out to 238.70 USD.  You'd have to work out driving times with Lorax on this one.  If you chose to fly out of Raleigh instead it would go down to 232.90 USD.  Going to Spokane would be more expensive - i.e. from Raleigh it works out to be about 421 USD. - Atlanta to Seattle is 359.40 USD also on Travelocity.  If you flew to Spokane, WA instead it would be 381.90 USD.  Depending on your flights we could probably pick you up in Spokane as its only 2.5 hours from us. - Phoenix, AZ to Spokane, WA on Travelocity is about 193.40 USD. - San Francisco to Seattle is 153.20 USD roundtrip (Travelocity).  From there you'd have to hook up with Lorax to get here.  Alternatively, you could fly from San Francisco to Spokane which is more expensive at 253.40 USD but you cut the driving time to your final destination probably by more than half (as compared to Seattle).  And thats all I have right now.  If you want something priced out - let me know and I'll see what I can find.    P.S. Other people can post on here too if they want :P  Thats the point in signing up :P

      And here they are...  10.  You get to meet all kinds of weird people from the internet. 9.  All your friends are doing it so stop being such a loser and do it too! 8.  If you're not Canadian, your money goes a lot further here! 7.  Tim Hortons, poutine and all things Maple Syrup! 6.  You have a much better chance of being snogged than you'd get at your local pub. 5.  Three words: Giant boob cake 4.  100% Pure Canadian beaver!  We do live in Beaver Valley afterall :) 3.  Beer! Beer! Beer and 1-800-REAL-ALE!  (Girlie drinks too if you want) 2.  You may get a chance to swing a foam bat at Fire!  And the number one reason to go to Canadameet is...  1. You get to laugh at things like this:

      Now before this continues on, I figure I'd give you some more details on this area and what to expect:   Accommodations :  As it is cheaper and generally more convenient for people to be all in one place, we are basically opening up our house to everyone.  The house has 2 furnished spare rooms, each with double beds, and one unfurnished spare room (empty).  There are also two couches and we'll have the use of a camping trailer in our driveway (it has a double bed and 2 singles).  Two tents will be available and we also have plenty of floor space.  If you want an idea of what the house is like there are before and after photos  urlLink here .  Should somebody really want to stay in a hotel there is one in Fruitvale called the Villager's Inn about 5 mins away - and I believe it is quite cheap.   The Area :  Here are a few websites that might be of interest if you want to get some insight into this area. 1) urlLink Fruitvale , this is where Adam & I live.  2) urlLink Trail , about 15 mins drive from us.  Has a small airport & is where we'll go if we go to a 'club'. 3) urlLink Castlegar , about 25-30 mins from us.  Location of another airport and other random stuff.  4) urlLink Nelson , a hippy-esque city about 1 hr from us. 5) urlLink Rossland , about 20 mins from us.  Home of the ski hill and gold mining museum.  6) urlLink Creston , about an hour from us. Home of the  urlLink Kokanee  brewery where we could do a tour should the thought strike us.   The Cost :  If you're coming from a country that deals in anything other than Canadian currency then you're in luck.  This area is extremely inexpensive so your cash will go much further (even compared to Toronto for all those who went to CAN2).  Even for other Canadians it will be relatively inexpensive. Obviously, the biggest cost is getting here - and then maybe the beer if you're going to have a lot ;)  If you are looking at ways to decrease the cost of you getting here, please feel free to ask as there may be some way we can help.  Until next time...

      So I made this up figuring it was a good place for people to see what is new, to ask questions or even just to laugh about old times (as well as post any links to old meet stuff)! I guess I'll start with the details of the upcoming meet:  Where: Trail/Fruitvale, BC, Canada When: Oct 8-11, 2004  If you are looking at flying in the closest airports are Castlegar and Trail.  Castlegar is serviced by  urlLink Air Canada  from Calgary and Vancouver and Trail is serviced by  urlLink Northern Hawk Air  from Vancouver only.  Coming from the UK, so far the cheapest flights I have found into Vancouver are with  urlLink Canadian Affair .  Again, you can also catch a ride with Jake/Camerak in Calgary or Steve/Lorax in Seattle. Flying into Spokane, WA is also an option.  Questions? :)  Enjoy!

      At 18.30 on Tuesday the tube strike started, it ended about 18.30 today. In that space of 24 hours I have been shocked by two things 1) Londoners have legs, and 2) Londoners are generous. Let me explain....  A lot of people commute into London from the suburbs and beyond. We have quite an extensive public transport network consisting of underground and over-ground trains, buses, taxis etc. The rail union for underground staff decided to hold a strike which people feared would bring London to a standstill and would cost the economy a heck of a lot of money. So this morning I walked into work - which is only like 25 mins and I often walk in anyways. The buses were packed, the roads were chockablock with cars, buses and taxis. It was total gridlock. Buses were having to drop people off half-way along the route leaving disgruntled commuters stuck half-way to work, but as I was walking along I noticed something amazing. There were lots of other people walking and more cyclists than normal. I was quite surprised, I guess when the worst happens and you have to get into work you make the effort. It does makes me wonder why these people don't walk more often.   But anyways, I can't comment coz I do often get the bus, and I did for the journey home (mainly because I wasn't feeling well - summer cold or something coming on methinks). So I waited with the not-so-large queue of people and got on the first bus that came. Well one lady didn't have change for the ticket machine (in central london you now have to buy your ticket before getting on the bus) and looked quite dismayed as she trudged off the bus having been told by the bus driver he had no change so couldn't take her. But then, from out of nowhere her guardian angel appeared, a lady who had like a carnet of bus tickets and just gave her one. How's that for generosity! Well it certainly proved to me that out there there are nice people in the world, and thanks to one of them, that lady got home a little earlier than she would have done with her faith in the world restored :)

      It’s been sort of a strange couple of days.  Every once and a while, I sort of move into brief periods like this where everything seems mildly surreal, as if I’m seeing things through a slightly skewed reflection and I’m not immersed in anything around me but instead drifting along in parallel, idly headed along somewhere.  It’s a very odd feeling of detachment that sort of permeates everything that I do.  It’s a sort of “catcher in the rye” type of feeling, isolation, sinking between curbs, and all that—I don’t really know.  I saw a play last night called “I Am My Own Wife.”  It was quite interesting and very well done, and in fact won the Pulitzer recently.  It’s a one-man performance (something which always impresses me) and the plot is fairly complex—it’s largely based on the life of a transvestite Berliner—who’s also a furniture collector and restorer and lives in a museum filled with old phonographs—born in the early 20th century and his (her) experiences as a homosexual living through two oppressive regimes: the Nazis and the communists.    The story is told, however, from the point of view of the author (an American homosexual man and the only actor in the play) who visits Berlin and tapes interviews that he conducts with her about her life for the purpose of—yes—writing a play.  So, it’s sort of both an autobiography of the author’s interactions with her, and a biography of her life, and scenes from both are interspersed to create a pretty powerful performance.  I would recommend it to anyone who has the chance to see it.  Going up to the country for a bit of a vacation tomorrow, which should be nice.  It’s summer, so I should be relaxed, but somehow I feel guilty about being relaxed, which makes it impossible to be relaxed.  So, yeah, hopefully I can just chill out.  Ciao.

      It feels sort of surreal around here right now. Saturday my babygirl will be turning 13, a teenager by definition. She definitely has moments of teenagerdom. She spends hours on the phone, she's forever painting her nails, fiddling with her hair and experimenting with makeup. The posters on her walls have changed from cuddly puppies to Orlando Bloom looking for all the world like a lecherous pedophile ready to pounce on my daughter - oh wait no, that's Ginge :)  The other day we were in the middle of laundry so she had on some old shorts and a tank that was far too small for her. Cleavage was everywhere, curves were there in places where there shouldn't be curves yet (at least not in my mind). It was startling. She looked older, and yet she was sitting on the couch playing with bubbles like a kid. I just can't get my head around this weirdness.  Of course she just laughs at me, or rolls her eyes when I point out all of this to her. She says she doesn't feel any different than she did last week and that I'm just being weird. Well, yes I am being weird, but it is a weird feeling. I wish I could explain it better. Maybe Kat will get some idea of it when her kidlets reach this age.  I find myself comparing her to what I remember of my teen years, or my sister's since Kelly (my sis) is 8 years younger than me, I can remember what she was like. I'm trying to avoid the pitfalls I remember. I'm probably more lenient with my daughter than my mom was with me; I know I talk to her more than my mom did with me about things that weren't big subjects when I was a teen (finances, sex, drugs and all that).   Anyway, enough of that. If anyone sees Arya around TCZ on Saturday, wish her a happy 13th and don't mind me sobbing in the corner.

      Stuff  Its funny how you can go in one direction for awhile, then all of a sudden, do a complete 360.  And no, I'm not talking about driving on ice in the wintertime....  I said I was going to wait till early next year to re-evaluate the whole house situation, since the previous encounter was very fustrating and unsettling.  But then before we knew it, we're thinking about putting a bid on a house.  Not completely sure if we're going to take it.  The price is perfect (Same as what I pay for rent right now).  But there is a bit of work to do to it, cosmetic and structure-wise (The foundation has a bit of unsettling, they said they could fix it before we moved in).  We're looking at a few more options, but might be moving in sooner then I think.  We're going to think about it very hard this week, and make a decision.  -- Things  Lately, my mind has been so scattered.  I will start working on one thing, then all of a sudden, I forget what I was doing before.  Fire just laughs at me when I'm typing something on TCZ and all of a sudden I just either end the sentance prematurely or just add a who and the end of it.  Heh, I find it pretty funny myself as well, but I think I seriously need a few days off work just to relax around the house and do some serious binge drinking.  Luckily I have extra money and we're coming up to a 4 day weekend!  (July 1st = Canada Day).  Mucho relaxo and golfo, with a side order of drinko.    Thats all for now  Bie!

      Greetings!  Well today was supposed to be my final post-miscarriage check-up but, as you might guess, this isn't the case.  No, it appears that there could be something wrong - they aren't quite sure yet what but I have to get an ultrasound either tomorrow or Wednesday so they can check it out.  Joy.  What does that mean? Well, they figure there are a few options - either I have a simple infection or there are pieces still left inside (which apparently could be from the one sac or perhaps therein lies the possibility that there was twins) OR it could be both.  Gross and stuff eh?  Yeah.  So if it is an infection - I get to take drugs.  And to jump the gun a bit - they've already given me the drugs.  So I get to take these orange horse pills for the next week - whee!  If its the "pieces" option then I get to have a D&C.   Yeah, I know - WTF is that?  D&C actually stands for "dilation & curettage" and basically is the scraping of the lining of the uterus.  And that means I get to go under anaesthetic too!  Its like I said - the fun never stops!  So thats the spiel.  Now as we wait for the votes to come in to see who our new Prime Minister will be, I'm going to work out.  Later!

      This weekend I was once again in Amsterdam and having been to the cinema to see Shrek 2 - I want a puss in boots! - Monster and I went to watch the Holland-Sweden match in one of the pubs in the centre. Having secured what seemed to be the last seat in the pub we settled down to wait for the match to start. It was amazing at how packed the pub became and I don't think I've ever seen so many people wearing orange - not even at the Easyjet check-in desks! Naturally the majority of the pub were supporting Holland, altho we did see one chap in a Sweden t-shirt who interestingly had an Italy sweatshirt tied round his waist - wise move methinks with that many orange peeps about ;)   Whilst it was a good match, I couldn't help feeling a little saddened as I recalled that only two days before I'd been sat gripped by the England-Portugal match and as the game went to penalties (as Monster had kept on telling me it would) I felt I couldn't quite join in with the euphoria of the celebrations as Van de Sar saved the penalty and Robben scored to win the game for Holland. Up until Saturday's match Holland had been afflicted with the same penalties curse as England - for some reason they just couldn't win a match on penalties and it was always heartache for the nation - but now for Holland at least the curse was lifted, and I felt a little jealous. I guess England just have to wait their turn for the curse to be lifted - or practice their penalty taking! Anyways, whilst I'm not switching my allegiance, I do kinda feel a warmth towards Holland so they'll be getting my support for the rest of the tournament, and as my darling boyfriend pointed out my hair does match the team colours ;)

      They are a little slow but they get the idea. When I sold my condo a few years ago I told them that they should buy a townhouse and I'll just pay them rent. This way they have a second house that they can make money off of and I can still have a house (I hate paying property organizations like Paradigm).  Of course they just hated this idea, assuming I was trying to pull something over on them (as if) and since I didn't feel like going through the paperwork of getting another house until I figure out where I want to live, I just submitted and rented out this apartment.  Now fast forward to June 27. My mother calls me and we're talking about her trip this week. She's going to be seeing some old friends, one of whom owns four houses in the Charlotte, N.C. area. They rent three of them out to their kids and just bought a fourth for themselves. Of course they've retired early and make great money off the interest rates of the homes while charging their kids pretty minimal rent to stay there. The thinking is that they can help their kids save up and buy houses of their own.  Now all of a sudden my parents think this is a WONDERFUL idea. Just brilliant. They were asleep when I sold my condo and suggested this idea but now thou art awaken.   Sounds all good but I've got six months on my current lease and I'm stuck, plus there's no guarantee I'll want to live here when it's up. So now they want to do this thing fairly quickly (they are impatient/impulsive like that) and I'm stuck in rental hell. I'm so angry I can't even give them a shit-eating "I told you so" grin.   So there are two options: either a) beg and plead the properties company to let me out of my lease (HA!) or b) Wait and see. The hope is I'll know whether I'm staying here or moving elsewhere by October and we can search for a place. The only saving grace could be if I get this particular job and I'll be forced to move somewhere in between Jacksonville and Atlanta. That could at least solve my lease problems because the paper will just give me the money to buy it out or take over the last six months and put an intern there or something.  Anyway...Parents are frustrating.

      I think my computer's slowly dying. A few months ago my CD-Rom drive kept opening and closing by itself, over and over again until I taped the fecking thing shut. Then it stopped for a while. Then I somehow lost my entire OS after merely attempting to install IE 6 again, which I was only doing to try and fix some weird .dll error. So I reinstalled my OS, and instantly became inundated with spyware all over the place. I cannot stress enough how evil that shite is and how the perpetrators of it should be dragged through a field of glass and then hung, drawn and quartered with me to slap the horses' backsides as they tear their limbs off.  That reminds me of a pub near the Tower of London called the Hung, Drawn and Quartered. But that's neither here nor there.  Anyway, I've run every kind of spyware killer I can find, edited registry files until I'm cross-eyed, and I still am unable to get rid of it all. And to top it off, my CD-Rom drive is now opening and closing over and over and it's pissing me off. This computer was purchased in 2001 so I think it's shelf-life is pretty much done. The crappy thing is that there's no way I could afford to replace it. So I shall have to Macguyver it until it finally kicks the bucket.  I'll keep it short tonight. I'd like to check my email but I have to close the browser first.

      Today I found a new apartment. well, I guess technically it's called a  'basement suite'  but whatever it's called, It'll soon be my new home. I get to move in about mid august - around the same time as my birthday. Some birthday present huh? I get to haul heavy boxes and furniture instead of relaxing. Too bad I can't call in sick and get someone to cover for me. Man, that would be sweet.  In other news, I think I'm developing a rash. and by  'rash' , I really mean  'strong relationship with my girlfriend' . I dunno what it is about her. She calls me up randomly to say weird things. Like, today for example - she called me up, and asked 'Is Rob there?'. Not so weird right? Yes - considering I live by myself, and there is no one else around to pick up the blasted phone. Then then proceeds to tell me about a dream she had involving ice cream, dancing hippos, and a couple of talking trees. The girl is insane. She's totally random, incoherent, and she slobbers a lot. I think I might marry her one day. She's perfect.  Earlier today I had what most people would call  'Breakfast' . Its the first time I've eaten food in the morning since Christmas. It was amazing. I woke up, went to the kitchen, made some eggs and toast, and ate it. All before 8:00 am. I really enjoyed breakfast. I think I might continue this tradition and explore other edible creations. I'm thinking about pancakes - I hear they're pretty good.

      Margaritas eh?  We just bought a *BIG* bucket of strawberry margarita mix which I may actually save for CAN3 now that we're up to ***24*** people! Woo hoo!  We just passed CAN2 by 2 people.  Yeah!  Well, of course, thats assuming that all goes well and they all show.  So more people should sign up!  Go on - do it! You know you want to ;)  At any rate, today has been a weird day of laziness, shopping and haircuts.  Adam and I both got much needed haircuts today - if you're bored you can check out mine  urlLink here .  Its just about 3 inches shorter than normal (due to summer and stuff).  Don't mind the fuzziness - I'm trying to learn to use PSP properly ;)  Then maybe I'll actually *buy* the program for a change!  In other news - we're finding the really weird thing to have to contend with these days is running into all the people we know and when they ask how "things are going" (meaning the pregnancy) we have to tell them that things are "not going".  Its such an awkward conversation to have - especially with people we don't really know well but we run into a lot and just know who we are (either through Adam's parents or from my work, etc).  Its just weird.  I live for the day where nobody asks me about the pregnancy anymore - I get on better day by day not having to think about it and when people ask - it makes you think about it.  So its all very weird.  Anyhoo, I'm going to go wake up Adam since he's still passed out on the couch (for a few hours now that lazy bum!).  I have to say I miss the smilies from the other blog!  Thats my only complaint :)  Bye!

      So it's party day. Jamie's birthday party day. His birthday isn't until tomorrow but we are having his party today. I'm telling you, if I get asked ONE MORE TIME how much longer til his party (Jamie can tell time btw) I'm going to commit Harry Carrey.  This morning was spent running all over Highland/Griffith/Munster trying to find hair dye. The party is Harry Potter and everyone is supposed to come over dressed like their favorite character from the book. We have been all over looking for washable hair-dye (black of course) and glasses. We FINALLY found the hair dye after I went to one of the salons to ask where I could find temp hair dye. I had been to Walgreens, Osco's, the Party Store, Target... so when I left there, I stopped by where Paul gets his hair cut and asked them and they sent me to a place like Sally's Beauty Supply. We didn't find any glasses though. I stopped by the eye place (For Eyes) and asked if they happpppened to be throwing out any old glasses that looked like HP glasses but they said no. However they did have the HP glasses in stock! So, for just a split second I got excited but that excitment faded as soon as I saw the price tag of $70. Which the lady then told me she could take $44 dollars off. I told her, thanks but that's ok. It's only a 1 time thing.   ARGGGHHHH!!! *GOES RUNNING DOWN THE STREET SCREAMING AND SHOUTING LIKE A LUNATIC*  ....yes, he asked me again... I'm sorry I ever told him he could have a party...  Anywhooo.... back to the glasses, I bought some black poster paper to try to make some glasses out of that. Goooood luck! I'm just so glad I don't have to prepare food. We are ordering pizza and having popcorn, pudding, and fruit snacks. Plus some drinks. I had thought of Butterbeer and Melia had given me the recipe, but jamie wants Pepsi (which I think Coke actually had something to do with HP) but maybe that and Orange kool-aid and that will be 'Pumpkin Juice'. I really don't like Pepsi. I'm a Coke or Dr Pepper girl. Water actually, most of the time, but I digress...  Ok I have to go, less than 4 hours now til this *ahem* !Very well put together party.  Have a great day  Oh yeah, pray this dye comes out of their hair.

      We all know that getting really, really drunk just sucks—there’s no two ways about it.  Sure, its fun for a little while, but it takes twice as long to recuperate, not to mention the fact that the process of recovery is twice as harrowing as getting tipsy is amusing (a concept that, admittedly, TCZ spods seem pretty familiar with).  However, what’s worse than getting really, really drunk, is getting really, really drunk at the same party your parents are at and then having to go home with them, sleep in the same house as them and therefore subsequently have to  wake up  in the same house as them.    I bring this up because this was exactly the predicament that I found myself in last night.  Let me just tell you, if I never have another sip of alcohol in the presence of my parents again it will be too soon.  Anyway, as you can probably imagine (or recall, if this has ever happened to you), this morning has made me greatly regret last night as it's been a lovely medley of kneeling over the bath-tub, bouts of insane awkwardness that ensued about the time of our rather rude awakenings (as it were), and other pleasant things of that nature.    So, allow me to close with two final thoughts, which are really just the same final thought repeated for emphasis: God damn margaritas, god  damn  them.  End Rant;

      Oh my good god I had to work today and boy did it suck.  You know, working in a bank/credit union isn't all its cracked up to be.  I mean you deal with money *all* day long except that NONE of it is yours.  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  Zip.  So it sucks.  It especially sucks when all day you are looking at accounts that have $20K or more in them - and again, its  NOT  yours.  Its amazing for this area - such small towns - how much money there really is.  There are so many rich people here, people you'd never GUESS had that much money... its crazy.  When is it my turn?  Anyways, as I was saying before I got onto the whole money thing - working sucks.  You know, I moved here late December - quit my job to move to a small town in the Kootenays and, maybe, hopefully, find a new job.  And I have one - its part-time/casual mind you but its a job.  But I now realize I hate working.  I had 3 months of doing-whatever-the-hell-I-want and I liked it.  I want that back.  Hell, I want a job where I can work from home so I can show up in my PJs.  That would even be acceptable.  But this getting up to go work for someone else really bites.  Especially at a job where you deal with money and none of it is yours.  Its Friday, its been a long day, I don't know what to make for dinner and I'm tired.  I'm so glad the weekend is here - not that I worked a lot this week - but the weekend means Adam will be home so I'll have someone to bug! *cackles evilly*  Okay I hear a nanaimo bar calling my name... Mmmmmm...

      It is currently 5:46pm. I've been doing laundry for 7 hours straight now. Load after load after load. It just keeps coming. I finish a load and a new pile of dirty clothes appears out of nowhere. I fear they are reproducing. I fear they will take over my apartment and hold me hostage. At times I can almost hear them planning their next moves.   They've taken over the kitchen. I still have the bedroom, but everytime I look away their army piles get closer. I fear I will not be able to hold them off much longer. I may need to relocate into the living room. I have planned an alternate way into the living room in case things get too bad.  [20 mins later...]  The bedroom has been seiged. They've completly overtaken it. I am hiding in the corner of my living room. I've been living off what little food I could find - a couple of frootloops, and some popcorn stuck in between the cushions of the couch. God only knows how long I will be here. They will find me. It's only a matter of time.   [25 more minutes pass...]  I fear I will not last much longer. The piles of dirty laundry are too much for me to handle. I have been able to fend them off for a little while using what little resources I could steal from the closet - half a bottle of tide and a few cups of Purex. My resouces are running out fast. It is only a matter of time before I am a POW.  Tell my parents I love them. Tell my sister I am proud of her. Tell my gf to move on and find someone else. Tell them all not to worry... tell them...

      My first ever blog.  From the guy who thought that writing your own blog was boring, uninteresting and pointless.  I would much rather read about other people's problems, days and lives than have them read about my own,  But oh well, I'll give this a try.  By far this is the worst year of my life.  Things from January til mid April were just shitty for my family.  Suicide attempts, job loss, heart problems, blood pressure, drug problems, deaths, broken hips and lots of problems.  Well, just when I had thought that May was great and June was almost over problem free, WHAM!  My grandmother who broke her hip in March (and was only given a week to live then) has gotten pneumonia and was found in her bed on Tuesday morning bleeding from the mouth and nose.  She is so fragile that the coughing she had been doing was ripping her throat open and causing her to bleed.  So she was rushed to the hospital where she was put on IV and oxygen immediately.  Within a few hours, she was doing better, but not much.  The coughing and such had subsided.  The poor woman is 96, and will be 97 in July.  She has Alhzeimers and knows no one.  It really hurts my Dad for him Mother to not know who he is.  She has gone from being about 180 lbs and in decent health in the early 90's to being an 80 lb person with no quality of life, who knows no one, is blind in both eyes, is deaf and doesn't speak.  I find it so unfair that young people are killed every day, all around the world, yet here is a woman who 'I haven't known in 10 years' who is in pain with a broken hip, requires morphine daily to keep down the pain.  She lies in bed suffering, and yet people are dying every day who I know she would if she could, gladly give them her life.  Anyway, enough with that.  I feel so much better now that I've vented.  And for those who didn't know, I recently started a new job in May.  I am a Support Specialist Level I at the University of Lethbridge library.  I moved across Canada to be here.  I live with Weagle (Scott) and Sydney (Susan) currently.  I am really enjoying my new job and the new area.  As my new manager said this morning, "You'll be my Jake-of-all-trades."  I will be doing html and java script, along with redesigning some webpages for the library, along with my current PC repair and media duties.  I'm excited.  The more useful I can make myself, the better chance that this will become a full time position for me after this contract expires.  Other than that, I really don't have much more to say.  For the last week, I have been watching my DVD set of Robotech, the first series, with Rick Hunter, Minmei, Max Sterling, Lisa Hayes and crew.  It's a great anime series from the early 80's.  I can't get enough of it.  But at 50 dollars a boxed set, and I have 3 of the 7, I couldn't afford more.  But then I tried Ebay and found them for about 5 dollars to 10 dollars American and started buying them up.  2 more sets are on the way and I'm currently bidding on 2 more.  This rocks!  It's exciting.  This weekend will be fairly quiet.  I hope to go to Cranbrook with Scott and Susan to drop off Susan's car for her parents, but I may just stay home and watch the NASCAR race from Sonoma, California!  I love road racing.  Anyway, enjoy your weekends and we'll see you again soon.  Same blog-time, same blog-channel!

      Well, not only is this my first contribution to the TCZ blog, it’s also my first blog post ever.  I decided it was due time that I gave in to the blog hysteria after having "lurked" on many a blog but never actually taken the time to join and start posting my thoughts.  As a bit of a disclaimer, I'll just start off by saying that I'm fairly sure that most of the stuff that goes on in my life is of little to no interest to anyone else and I'll do my best not to bore anyone here, but I take no responsibility if you end up bored nonetheless ;-)  So, for those of you that don’t know me too well, I’m a student living in New York City, which I suppose is a pretty good place to be a student (though I don’t have much of a frame of reference since I’ve lived here my whole life).  People seem to have a lot of weird stereotypes about New Yorkers in general though, which is pretty odd considering this is one of the most ethnically and intellectually diverse cultural centers in the world.  Consequently, there tends to be a lack of homogeneity in how people act and think, and that’s one of things I like most about living here—you rarely know what to expect when meeting new people.  In all fairness, though, I probably don’t fully utilize what New York has to offer.  There are literally hundreds of bars, clubs, museums, institutes, theatres, and other diversions of social/cultural persuasion, but I tend to only visit a few of them regularly—then again, another thing I like about New York is knowing that they’re there anyhow.  I like having options.  Sure, I always order Chinese from the same place, but that doesn’t mean I don’t like knowing that I could order it from about 20 other places if I felt so inclined!  I happen to live in a really nice residential area of the city right by Central Park, which makes the general urban hubbub a lot easier to deal with.  The Park is a pretty extraordinary entity.  It plays host to hundreds of thousands of people day in and day out, providing a much needed breather from the sirens and car alarms and cab drivers yelling in rabid middle-eastern languages.  It’s pretty small when you consider it geographically, and yet in the two almost-two-decades I’ve been visiting it I still always manage to find something new each time I go.  I love the city, but sometimes I really need nature, and the park can provide quick respite from the towering walls of brick and glass at every turn when I don’t get the chance to take a full fledged vacation.  On a slightly different note, after reading the Times’ review of Michael Moore’s new movie, Fahrenheit 9/11 (link  urlLink here ), I really, really, really want to see it (of course, I still really wanted to see it beforehand, but now I want to see it even more!).  I can’t say I love Michael Moore, but he does make pretty interesting movies.  Sure, they can be contradictory and at times downright annoying, but they’re also often really illuminating, and they shed light on a lot of problems in the US that are overlooked by the many people sitting pretty in its uppermost echelons (who unfortunately happen, more often than not, to be the decision makers).  Anyway, so concludes my deflowering post.  I am no longer a blog virgin. Yay.

      How I learned to love to post and stop worrying about the Bomb.  Blogging is overrated. The newsmedia likes to say that blogging is 'the new art form', 'the "NEW" new media'. Instead of writing letters to the editor, we're told that we can reach a greater audience through our blogs, where the whole world can come to our pulpit and listen to us espouse our views, personality, etc.  There are many, many problems with this:  1. The majority of people online don't have personalities. This community does, thank god, but how many blogs have you read where it's 'i went to school and she was like 'omg, look at u, she's usch a b!tch!''. An infestation of 14 year olds; the only cure, to go back in time and castrate their fathers, if they even know who their fathers are.  2. On the odd chance that someone DOES have a personality, it's most likely a female. Thus, the readership of the blog is all men, desperate men who will wax poetically about how great the blogger is for the sole purpose of getting into her pants. I've seen this happen more then once. The supposed great thing about blogging is that you can learn a lot about a person from what they write. Unfortunately, it usually degrades into "Whoa, she's hot, I'm going to read her blog!"    3. The other sect of common bloggers are nerds. Nerds who will blog about their favorite Star Trek: Voyager episode or posting pictures of their new computer case mod. You know the type. "Smarter" then everyone else, everyone else is a fool, everyone else is ignoring the obvious, everyone else should just do what I say and then everything will be ok. They are also found hanging around #2 blogs, not to mention their parents basement.  4. Political blogs are the worst. There is no grey. There are "Democraps" and "Republi-Cons". Attempting to determine meaning from these blogs is pointless. You're better off reading the hot girls blogs for all of the 'information' you're going to get.  5. Bloggers have nasty, nasty habits of regurgitating other blogs. Just like email chain letters that get sent around, communities of bloggers pop up parroting the same old information that appears on everyone elses blog. Instead of individual thought and expression, we get "SO and SO posted this on his blog, *Copy and paste*". In an attmept to be more popular, we mimic those that we want to get attention from. A lot like high school really. I always wanted to be the head cheerleader :(  At any rate, this blog is different. We all come from different backgrounds, countries, ideals and the only thing that binds us is a little thing we like to call TCZ. This forum is open to everyone, the high school girls, the snooty computer nerds, the pseudo-political-intellectuals and thus, if there was ever a blog that you should read, this should be it.  *cross-posted to Adam Online, LiveJournal, DeadJournal because that's what computer nerds do.

      It's freaking freezing in my office today. I think Joey has been messing with my thermometer. So I type this with frozen fingers.  Anyway... It's apparently Hawaiian Day at work today. I just got lei'd (har har.) I think one of the nursing units decided to have a bit of fun today and did the hawaiian theme and it's spread throughout the hospital. There are always, in every organization, those people who go all out on things like this. The woman who came in with the leis was dressed in full-on Hawaiian mumu, with big floppy hat and sunglasses and she's going around to all the departments in my building handing out the leis.  I wish I could be that unselfconscious. I'm more the 'These leis itch' type and mine are now sitting on a corner of my desk. Tonight I'll take them home and give them to my darling daughter who will probably hand them off of a nail stuck in the wall and there they will hang until the end of time. Then a year from now I'll see them and wonder where the hell they came from.  Wow two paragraphs out of Hawaiian Day. And I was worried I wouldn't have anything to write about :)  God I really wish people would refrain from bursting into my office as if it's just some closet or something. It scares the bejeezus out of me because I don't see them coming. Here I am, thinking hard about what to write in here (yes I know I should be working, but I'm on my lunch hour), staring at my keyboard, willing it to extract the thoughts from my head when the door flies open with a loud crack and some chirpy person from the Education department breezes in on her way to the *actual* closet attached to my office. I have a private office but one of the bad things about it is that the Education department keeps all of their CPR dummies in the closet here. Whenever they have a class over in my building (usually they're located in the other building) they're in and out of my office constantly all day long. It's a little annoying and disruptive, especially with the noisy door and their tendency to burst in without warning. Then they leave the damn closet door open with the light on (well, it's more of a hall actually) and it's even colder in there than it is in my office. Grrrrr.  So, speaking of feeling scared (nice segueway eh?), I'll chime in on Fire's post about fears to mention mine. I actually think I've talked about mine before when Anne posted in the BBS once asking 'what scares the hell out of you.' I love to swim. But I cannot have someone hanging on me while doing so. Not my daughter, or a boyfriend or just a friend playing a friendly game of 'dunk.' I'm afraid I'll be pushed under and then be unable to surface. So I guess it's a drowning fear. I can't even stand to watch underwater sequences in films or on TV either. I get out of breath and tense. I even know what the fear stems from because it's probably one of the most vivid early memories I have.  When I was little, we moved to an apartment complex in Palm Springs, CA which, of course, had a pool. They all did in Palm Springs because the heat there is atrocious. Anyway, I was innocently paddling around in it one day when my friend decided to jump in, land on me, and cling to me. She wouldn't let go either and I kept going under and had absolutely no control, no chances to grab a breath before going back under. All the while she was giggling and thought we were having a great time. I don't remember exactly how old I was, but we couldn't have been more than five I guess. Anyway, I'm positive that's why I can't stand anyone hanging on me in the water.  The other thing I fear is the same as Joey, and that's death. I don't like to think about my own mortality, and I definitely have nightmares about something happening to my daughter. That scares me to pieces. The more I think about it though, I think death saddens me moreso than scares me I guess. The fear is my own death and what would happen to my daughter and my family and friends. The sadness from worrying about losing what little family I have left. And I know that was never much a concern of mine until my father suddenly died, followed several years later by my mother who also died out of the blue. No one close to me had ever died before that could have prepared me for such devastating losses. Even just writing about it now makes me feel sort of weepy.  So I shall stop. I've rambled enough for one post :)

      If you know what the first part of the title means, you've obviously played in a few poker tournaments :)  Its a $30 buy-in tournament with 3 dollars going to the house.  NL stands for No-Limit.  The game in question is Texas Holdem...The Cadillac of Poker  I've been kinda a student to the game of No-Limit Texas Holdem for about 4 years now.  When I was at the Casino a few weeks ago on training (Not poker training, work training, I just stayed at the casino hotel :)), I picked up a few magazines that are delivered to all canadian casinos.  Its called Canadian Poker Player ( urlLink Http://www.canadianpokerplayer.com ).  In the May issue, they had an article regarding home games.  I was very shocked to see that there was an article about a home game right here in Fredericton.  So I sent them an email to get an invite to their weekly home games and monthly tournaments.  Tonight will mark my first NL tournament with this group, and I'm very much looking forward to it.  I've been playing with the same group of guys from home for years now, and I pretty much know their betting patterns and strategies.  When you sit down at a table with a completely new crowd, you always learn something new.  I'm very much looking forward to tonight, not only for the game I love, but to meet new people in the city.    Now, off that subject, and maybe a quick response to Fire's post regarding fears....  I never thought I did before, but I really fear death.  I sometimes get this chill in my body whenever I think of what would happen if I died tomorrow, what the (2, maybe 3 ;)) people would do if I was gone.  When I was young, I was kinda a daredevil...I never feared getting hurt, and would do just about anything people dared me to do.  Now that I'm settling down with my life, I fear dying more and more every day.  I wonder why I do.  I guess its the natural life cycle.    I never really noticed this until I started flying.  My trip to Jamaica a few years ago included me almost going nuts in the plane when it was in turbulance.  So, maybe its a combination of fear of death and fear of flying.  Anyway, I swore I wouldn't travel without Melissa on a plane again, she makes me feel more comfortable when I'm with her.  Awwwwwwwww.  Work beckons.

      Is summer over yet? Am I a horrible mother for wishing that the kids were back in school? I love my 3. I really do, but when they have absolutely nothing to do for days at a time, other than pick fights with each other and ask me the 3 same questions over and over and over again.. 1) Can I hold my hamster?! 2) Can I hold Matthew's Hamster? 3) Can Matthew/Laith/KiKi/Jenna come over? (all asked in rapid succession). Arrgghhh!! I'm signing the boys up for fall soccer on Saturday and then signing them up for July "Pal's in the Park". Pal's will get them out of the house MWF's through July from 9-12pm. Soooo maybe that will help them. Jamie had a really good week last week because he had soccer camp and he was pretty easy. *Crossing fingers* Sunday is Jamie's birthday. He'll be *gasps* 7! I can't believe. His party is Saturday night. He's invited some of the neighborhood kids over to watch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets with him. They are all supposed to come dressed as their favorite character. He's invited 7 children, but 2 of them, so far, aren't coming. That's because, Ellie, gets very scared. When Jamie said what he wanted to do, I knew that she and her brother, Dawson, probably wouldn't be able to come. Hopefully, though, the rest will show up. Unlike last year when only 2 kids out of his 24 in his classroom showed up for his party at Chuck E Cheese. It was really sad:( But, thankfully he didnt really notice or if he did, he didn't let on.  This morning, I was getting the kids dressed and fixed Sarah's hair and brushed Matthew's. Well, Jamie has a new haircut. We went to the beauty shop the other day and he went through 2 THICK hairstyle books looking for his new hairstyle:) It took him a good 30 minutes to mull over the pages and find just the right style:) Our 7 yr old now requires hair products (gel) for his hair! Oi vey.  Anyway, back to this morning... Jamie has now decided he will be sporting a mohawk:) His hair is longer on top so it's very easy to do it up down the center and well.. he did:) Melia teased me saying, next thing I know, he'll be wearing all black and coming home with piercings!! NOOO! *sighs* I called Paul and he said, "I don't think so":):) And so it begins....:) I think I'll post a picture of Jamie's new 'do'. He's got allergies or something because his eyes are all puffy and squinty. In all of the pics I took of him this morning, he looks either drunk or is blinking. Anywhoo:) Here are some pics:)    urlLink    Matthew&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Jamie mohawk&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Sarah&nbsp; urlLink     take care ~kat:)

      Having recently gone through a traumatic experience, I've spent a lot of time discussing things, stuff and items with my significant other. One thing that came up was my fear that what actually did happen would happen. Fear is a funny thing. On the one hand, it crushes your spirit, destroys your body and dampens your enthusiasm; on the other hand, fear is a necessary adjunct to living. It prepares you for extreme circumstances (Fight or Flight) and prevents you from engaging in things that may cause your bodily harm (Taking a beer away from Camerak, for example). So, what do YOU fear?  As some people may or may not know, I'm quite claustrophobic. If I'm travelling as a passenger in a vehicle, more often than not you'll see me huddled up against the window; and if I'm not at a window, I'll be asleep (or some reasonable variant therein, eyes closed, breathing slowly). When I book flights, I always using the seating arrangements to ensure I have a window seat. If I can't get a window seat, I'll take an aisle seat...but I really cannot stand sitting between two people; there's something quite debilitating about being stuck between two people. A while back, on a 1 hour flight to Calgary, I was trapped between a rather large man and a smaller asian girls, and I was scared I was going to flip out. I attempted to sleep it off, but my body kept violently jerking me awake as some type of reflex. In Switzerland, I was travelling down a gondola in the middle of a fairly intense snowstorm (enough that I couldn't see out the windows) and by the time I got to the bottom I was not a happy camper...felt quite nauseous. I discovered another phobia of mine, but I'm not quite sure the word for it so I'll have to cram two phobias I do know into one..I call it: agoracousticophobia, the fear of the noise of large crowds. I was sitting at dinner in Earls today, and sitting at my table, listening to the cacophony of people and cars and dishes rattling and the like was steadily making me more and more uncomfortable. I wouldn't say that I was physically afraid, but I could feel flight or fight impulses taking over. My ears were becoming very sensitive to the near-randomness of the conversations drifting in and out of earshot. Likewise with walking down Robson St. in Vancouver. I'm almost forced to shut off my brain temporarily and drift on automatic, focussing on some deep down need to get home to the quiet.   Thankfully, I do have an explanation for this fear. I have one regularly occuring dream that continues to haunt me. I am in a large dark cavern-like place. I hear what sounds like a ball rolling towards me. The rolling sound becomes louder and louder and the cavern I am in becomes smaller and smaller. The closer the sound gets, the worse it sounds; like static on a radio mixed with screams and horns and any noise you can think of. At the same time I feel the weight of whatever is approaching slowly pushing me. I fall to my knees, cover my ears with my hands and cannot block out the sounds or the feelings. I feel myself almost shrinking in response to my 'attacker'...I welcome my shrinking as I will be less likely to be crushed if I am small enough to pass by. The sound-ball/shrinking-cavern collapses on me and I wake up screaming. Disconcerting to say the least; I've had this dream many times.   Let's see what the DREAM DICTIONARY tells us:   Shrink  To dream that you are shrinking, suggests that you lack self-confidence and self-esteem. You may also feel embarrassed or unimportant in some situation. Perhaps you feel that you have been overlooked by others. Alternatively, the dream may refer to a time were you were young and small and thus symbolic of your childhood.   No one would say that I lack self-confidence or self-esteem so I'll have to scratch that one off.  Cave  To dream that you are walking in a dark cave, signifies refuge or the unconscious mind. It also denotes that you experience some unexpected misfortune or disagreement.   A little vague. Who hasn't experienced misoftune or disagreement?  Noise  To hear a strange noise in your dream, signifies the unexpected and the unknown. You may be expressing some fear or confusion concerning a particular situation in your waking life. The noise in your dream may serve as a way to attract your attention to that issue. Alternatively, noise may represent a breakthrough in your personal struggles. Perhaps you have burst through a barrier of resistance which had been holding you back for a long time.   Or maybe I've watched Indiana Jones too many times :)  Darkness  To dream that darkness comes upon you, signifies failure in work you may attempt. Darkness is synonymous with ignorance, the unconscious, evil, death, and fear of the unknown. To dream that you are lost in the darkness, denotes feelings of desperation, depression, or insecurity.   No dream dictionaries have anything with regards to being crushed...very disappointing :(   So, now that you know what you fear, how do you conquer those fears? Or should I save those for another day?

      I've just signed up with this new blogger, and I must say that I am enjoying it so far. Everything is easy to read and it is well organized! I guess all I have to do now is find stuff to write about - without boring you all to death...  Last week I called my 'money guy' to see if I could cash in some of my RRSP's and growth funds so that I could have some money to play with. I'm moving next month and need the extra cash to set up stuff and to get a phone line installed... yadda yadda. Today I got a call from this guys secretary. She wants me to write a letter to them asking for "Full surrender of the policy" I've never done anything like this before and had no idea what to write. So I kept it nice and simple. Hopefully I'll have the money soon so I can start planning the move - renting the truck, getting boxes etc.   I went and looked at a basement suite yesterday. It's so much better then the apartment I'm living in now. This new place has a new kitchen, new bathroom, comes with a  piano  (whee!) and has a cool security system. The only bad thing about it is that the bedroom is super small - so what I would end up doing is giving my couch and bed to my sister, and buy a hideabed, then use the bedroom as a computer room/study area. Which wouldn't be too bad :) Its close to the university I'm going to, which is the main selling point. After looking at the place, I explored the neighbourhood a bit - I'm close to the skytrain, a lake, a park and the grocery store. I really hope I get this place!

      So I've decided to venture into the world of blogging.  Joy!  Gathering from the posts I've read here for about a year, I've come to one sad conclusion...My life is just not that exciting...But don't let that detour you from reading my posts!  I'm sure from time to time you've enjoy the trivial things that is my life, so lets get this sorted then.  Most of you know I'm from Eastern Canada, which can sometimes be a great thing, and sometimes, like when it comes to airfare, a horrible thing.  I've been looking at flights to such places as London (YES MATT, I HAVE LOOKED INTO GOING TO BOMO, STOP ASKING!), as well as the recently announced Canadameet 3.  I have a hidden agenda though by going to Can3...One being visiting other friends and family.  I have scattered friends that have moved from home to venture for work, and it would be nice to finally visit them for a change.  Not to mention, I won't have to convert my canadian play money! w00t!  Anyway, flights from Fredericton are terrible, as many from the area can attest to.  Unless you get to a major airport city like Montreal or Toronto (Maybe Halifax to a lesser extent), you might as well tack on an extra 500/person just to get you there.  TERRIBLE!  So needless to say, here's waiting for a seat sale.  Today was a nice relaxing day at work, for a change.  They've having Employee Appreciation Day for the customer site I work on, and they invited us to join in on the festivities.  Very nice of them to do so I might add.  They just served us catered lunch and I'm stuffffffed.  I guess I'll end here, instead of rambling on my first blog.  So there goes my blogger cherry, and I'll never get it back again :(

      This was Matthew's birthday cake that Paul made for him:) As you can tell, it was a Batman theme:) Jamie's birthday is coming up this weekend and it's a Harry Potter theme. It'll be interesting to see what he comes up with to try to top this one:)

      Right.  Let the blogging re-commence (and this time on blogger, so it's officially blogging and not greymattering like before, or something.)  Um, yeah.  I've finally found a free ten minute window to write something down in (although as I say that, here comes my boss to ask some random question...)  Anyway, it's been a hectic few days.  The biggest saga is that my roommate has graduated and is now off to San Francisco in a month for a job.  This leaves me considering options for housing in the near future, with the favorite being to stay in my current place and find a new roommate or two (it's a 3 BR place), but of course this requires either screening random wackos who answer a classified ad, or hunting down people I know who can get out of rental agreements in short order.  Human interaction, of course, is not something that I have any semblance of skill in.  So we'll see where this leads over the next few weeks.  Meanwhile I find myself playing on two crappy soccer teams (and before you ask, they were crappy BEFORE I joined, although I'm not going to help the situation any.)  This would be fine and dandy if it weren't nearly 90F (~32C) outside all week and we actually had subs.  As much as I enjoy running around for 90 minutes at that temperature, there's a point where there's just no more fluid to sweat out.  Hmm.  Maybe I can find a roommate who has an interest in soccer.  Oh, and book your seats now on the Lorax Express to Trail/Fruitvale in October.  We're aiming for new world record times.

      After a long few days of scanning, editing, creating sites and uploading - my pictures page is finally complete.  What did I do thats different?  Well, I basically used one of those thumbnail thingies so its easier for people to glance through them.  The hardest files were the meet photos, but, thankfully, its all done now.  The only thing is that I'm going to have to do still is upload the videos and sort through those.  I haven't quite decided how I'm going to do that so we'll see...  In other news, things are slowly calming down here. I'm starting to feel somewhat better although if it would rain and the heat would go away it would make it a lot easier.  Something about hot weather just makes me feel a bit crankier.  Apparently, we're not expecting and cooler weather till Sunday.  Blah!  I think its just because I hate cooking in such heat as well.  I like to leave things till later on days like these - like last night.  Adam and I walked along the highway to the end of Old Salmo road and walk up it.  It was really dark but so quiet and nice.  Thats the thing about this area though - its a small town and with that you can see almost every star on a clear night.  Thats what our hammock is for.  Late night, backyard cuddling :)  In the coming weeks I also will have the pain of shopping for a bathing suit.  I have no idea what happened to mine from last year (maybe left it at my dad's?) but now I need a new one.  Its a pain because its just impossible to find anything you like in a small town like this.  Well not totally impossible but it requires a lot of time and effort.  Lastly, Adam and I have decided to hold a meet here this coming October.  Surprisingly, we already have some good numbers signing up for it (even with some international people!).  Hopefully it will turn out as great as CAN2 did and with even more people.  We haven't even told all the locals yet so we'll see.  So please sign up if you're interested or even check out the website: http://canadameet.xtine.ca/  Now I need to lay down... see ya :)

      *taps on the screen* Is this thing working? Seems to be, thanks Melia!   So, back to the title. I've heard quite a few people saying something similar today - I guess when it's grey and doesn't stop raining you do have to ask if it really is summer given that it is mid-June. It's only when you realise that Wimbledon started on Monday and you cast your mind back to last year and the year before (and the year before...you get the picture!) that you realise it's the same every year. Here in the UK we've enjoyed some gorgeous weather with temperatures hotter than most of Europe and clear blue skies filled with sun - so we're more than a little pissed off that the annual two weeks of June rain has descended once more.  Hopefully summer - in the form of sun and hot weather - will return once Tim Henman has won Wimbledon and England have won Euro 2004 and we can get back to complaining about how it's far too hot ;) I guess the English are never happy when it comes to the weather...but we wouldn't have it any other way ;)

      So I got the job. Yes I hear everyone I've been pestering for the past couple of weeks with my mounting anxiety breathing a sigh of relief now that they know I won't bug them anymore. Now I shall gratefully accept all of the 'I told you so's and sit back and breathe my own contented sigh of relief.  Mo' money. Mo' vacation time. And to top it off, I can stay on at the hospital on a sort of "contract" basis. It's not really contracting, they call it 'pool' status which I guess means I join a pool of employees they can call on to do stuff. But I can transition in whomever takes over my job here, as well as carry on doing the 'outside of my job description' work I do for other departments like Powerpoint storyboards and newsletters etc. So I'll have a small secondary income which will be really nice.  Finally I can begin to dig out of the hole I'm in. It's a shallow hole, I don't have the huge amounts of debt hanging over me that some people have. I have no credit cards, mortgages or anything. I just have your basic, normal bills that somehow amounted to more than I earn currently and have been steadily piling up as I juggle them. But anyway, no more. I am not going to be going on any wild spending sprees now that I'll have a bit more cash flow but I may break down and buy myself a new crockpot :)  Anyway, that's my final update on this whole thing. I start in 2 weeks. I've given my notice here and now I have to clear out 4 years of accumulated crap out of my office. Wheeee!

      I'm all moved into the new place.  Now the fun begins: unpacking!  I hate to clean and put stuff away.  This is probably going to take a while.  Actually the biggest motivator for all of it is trying to find stuff you know you have... somewhere.  Like for the last week I've been wearing tank tops if I go anywhere outside, not only because it's warm outside, but because I have NO IDEA WHERE ALL MY BRAS HAVE GONE.  I actually unpacked a bunch of clothes cause I have to work tomorrow and, well, as much as I've embraced the hippie within, I don't think I can get away bra-less in summer in an office.  For that matter, I dunno if I want to.  I'm covering for a receptionist at a placement agency where they place a lot of factory workers with many social disabilities.  And Friday is payday.  Guess where they'll be?  Maybe I'll just be able to send them off without any sort of problems if I wear a skirt tomorrow. :)  I've spent the last three days coating the hardwood floor in the other unit with polyurethane (takes 24 hours to dry between coats).  Anyway, inevitably, the stuff ends up on me.  Mostly my legs, cause I'm working on hands and kneees, but I got a couple of nice spots on my hands too.  Now, imagine this.  The Minwax polyurethane is largely a clearcoat, but it's got a slightly brownish tinge to it.  Now try to imagine clearcoating your skin with a polymer that'll dry hard ;).  And it doesn't wash off.  It's like superglue.  You have to wait for your skin to wear off, cause if you pick at it it takes your whole dermal layer with it.  It's really frigging hot in here.  I have this nice finished attic, but guess where all the heat in the house goes, naturally :)  Kids, they're not kidding.  Heat DOES rise.  See, you can learn all sorts of useless information at school :)  Anyway, last comic standing is on!  I'm outtie :)

      Hello.   I haven't posted recently, mostly because I've been busy with work and such - these things happen.&nbsp; At present, my work mainly entails showing grossly over-paid,&nbsp;incredibly neurotic people who have incredibly short attention spans how to accomplish ostensibly simple tasks on the computer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these tasks&nbsp;become infinitely more difficult when no one listens to explanations, and no one does.&nbsp; So, after 8 hours at the office, my time comprised predominately of 20-minute segments in which I explain such computer subtleties as the difference between a "right click" and a "left click," I am usually quite ready to jump off a rather large bridge.   Sadly, I don't have the balls.   In other news, I saw a new musical tonight, music and lyrics by Steven Sondheim, starring (and written by) Nathan Lane.&nbsp; It's a very free adaptation of the Aristophanes Play, "The Frogs," in which Dionysos and his slave Xanthias go to the underworld to try and brimg back a playwright to save mankind.&nbsp; The original version of the play was laden with political satire and subtle humor, as was&nbsp;Lane's adaptation (for instance, the frogs who attack pre-emptively but then can't remember why they attacked in the first place).&nbsp; It was sort of funny, but mainly disjointed and all-together not worth the money.&nbsp; It was fun seeing Nathan Lane 10-feet from my face, I admit, but somehow it wasn't quite as epiphanic (is that a word?)&nbsp;a moment as I had envisioned.&nbsp;  You probably could've&nbsp;done something more productive with the minute it took you to read this post.  End.  &nbsp;

      So I have my interview on Tuesday morning with the paper and my nerves are beginning to jangle. I haven't done this in several years.&nbsp;I had a phone interview last week that (I thought) went very well after spending a nerve-wracking couple of days waiting for the call. I'm a worrier and I overthink everything. I don't want to, but it just happens. I'd love to be Miss Laidback, everything's cool, no worries. But I'm finding that I am just not that way.  The director set up a phoner with me for "sometime Tuesday afternoon or anytime Wednesday." Of course I said I'm available but I wish I would have pushed for a specific time. I'm also maybe a little *too* accomodating. I'm one of those people who will be at your beck and call if I'm needed (in a work situation that is. Don't get any ideas.) So of course I tell her I'm available at her convenience which I've read is not necessarily a good thing. But anyway, I figure it's like picking a jury - it's unpredictable. She may have appreciated me accomodating her, then again maybe she wasn't. See? I'm overthinking it already and it all happened last week.  Anyway, no call on Tuesday and by 4pm Wednesday I'm beginning to panic. What if she hired some else? What if she changed her mind? What do&nbsp;I do if she doesn't call? Do I then have to bother her with a call or email? What if I do that and I end up sounding desperate and annoying? See what I mean? I'm sure I drove poor Cathy (in my office) nuts with my edginess. Thankfully, she called at 4:15 and I figured she was probably just leaving it til the end of the day since she was calling me at work to do this.   The call went well as I said. We talked about the possibilty of moving to another town and whether that would appeal to me. It would if the town were Lincoln or Omaha, but the town she named is crap and I don't want to live there. So she said that was okay, she had positions open here in town as well. Then we went over my experience and what sort of things I'm comfortable working with. She cracked a joke or two, I laughed but kept my joke-making at a minimum. I crack jokes when I'm nervous and they mostly fall flat. Then we set up a time to meet face-to-face and she emailed me the official job description and rang off.  Soooo, I've been purposely keeping my mind off the interview as much as I can all weekend but as the time inches closer, I can feel it in my toes. My skin is tingly, my muscles are tense and my brain's going a million miles an hour. Tomorrow I'll be looking over example interview questions, trying to get a couple of my references to write me something because I'm not sure if I should do that or just provide their names and numbers. All this resume/interview etiquette stuff is doing my head in. I just want the job. The money would be better, the job more interesting and fast-paced, I'd get to work on a team rather than holed up in my little cave on my own working for a company with great people, but ssslllooooww progress and low pay.  I'm going to shutup now :) This is all arse-numbingly dull I'm sure. I return you to Fire's use of the word 'Meme' and Narmer's dating adventures.

      After waiting way too long, I have finally booked my ticket to B10!! Although, this will be my sixth meet, it will be the first in England, and my first trip ever to England.&nbsp; Somewhat embarassing for me, as I have now been living in Europe for 4 years. So I will have to leave my "comfort zone" of German-speaking Europe for that strange uncivilized south coast of England.&nbsp; I am sure they are no longer running around in purple paint as the Romans found them 2000 years ago&nbsp;or so ;)  Anyways, I feel a lot better now that I have finally gotten a ticket.&nbsp; I plan to go with my fellow Swiss residents, Reethi and Sunshine, both of which are Bomo veterans and should know how to deal with things unknown to me such as trains that are not on time ;).&nbsp; Hmm.. I shall have to get a few pounds (the money type) as well.  It will only be four days, but I think I should get the "core Bomo" experience. All of the previous meets I have been to have been on the European continent.&nbsp; As most of the attendees were from the UK, they have always been sort of "tourist meets," in which visits to the nearby tourist destinations have been one of the key attractions.&nbsp; I think Bomo will be different.&nbsp; For me, of course, just going to England will be fascinating.&nbsp;   I have had many a chance to go to England before, including an offer of a "free trip" thanks to the generosity of a woman who was "desperate" for company, but like an idiot, always turned them down (partly because of pressure from my father who thought England would be no challenge as they speak "English".  So now that my credit card is charged, it looks like I better go..!

      I'm probably not adding this right. Oh well, nothing else has been right today. &nbsp; Paul is home (thank God). Matthew and Sarah are in bed. I just fed Jamie. I was in tears (and still am, off and on) when I picked up Paul. I know he hates coming home to this kind of thing when he's had a long day at work. I mean, it's gotta be hell working with nekkid women all day huh? The demands on him. Poor guy:) But seriously, I know he has long hard days and I really hate the fact that he has to come home with me in tears.  I also hate the way I feel after hard days with Jamie. It always seems to be Jamie. I hate the way I feel because I feel like I am failing as a mother. I get sooooo mad at him and end up screaming at the child and I'm sure by the end of the day he's pretty sick of it too. I mean, it can't be fun staying in trouble all day. I love that little boy to death. I can not imagine my life without him. He's my little buddy but when he has bad days, he has BAD&nbsp;days.&nbsp; Tonight while he was eating supper, I was sitting in the living room waiting for him to eat and he came over to me and laid his head down on me and said, "Don't you have any medicine in the kitchen for me?" THAT broke my heart. I tried to explain that the medicine isn't what makes him a good boy, that he has to learn to control himself as well. He&nbsp; knows that something is different but I don't want him to think the medicine is what 'makes him a good boy'. He has to learn to take responsibility himself. But it's been so long since he's been that hyper and uncontrollable. All I keep coming back to though after we fight is how much I love him and don't want him to think otherwise. I would die if he thought I didn't.&nbsp;

      God I'm in such a friggin HORRIBLE mood. Horrible horrible horrible. It's just been a bad day from the moment I got up. Jamie didn't get his meds(adhd) today. I ran out. So he's been literally BOUNCING off the walls. He can't be quite for two seconds and made the biggest scene in Meijers. He's back talked me and defied everything I've told him. I've lost track of all the punishments I've given out. From what I can remember, he's grounded thru Sunday. No bicycle, no cd player, no gameboy or xbox and no one will be coming over to play and he's not going anywhere. I called his doctor yesterday to ask her for a refill on his meds. I went and picked&nbsp;it up today and rushed it up to the pharmacist who said, "Oh ready in 20 minutes". Thank GOD. Only 20 more minutes of this craziness .... I can do this. 20 minutes later, I rushed back up to the pharmacy to pick up the presciption only for them to say "We called the doctor to make sure we could give him the generic and they said sure HOWEVER the prescription is written for tomorrow and she wouldn't ok it for today". WHAT THE F***!?!?!?!?!?! Does she KNOW the day I've had?? Does she not UNDERSTAND what a parent goes through??? OMFG.  All of this on top of the stupid Dodge dealership was supposed to install our dvd player in our car this morning. I called them at 830 this morning to make sure we were still on to bring the car in. Well, no, apparently the guy didn't write the appointment down in the books. SO, no one knew what was going on. They were also supposed to give us an extra key and a driver's manual. The guy said he was going to have to order the dvd player to match our interior and no one could tell me anything about it. So, Dave (the guy I spoke to on the phone), said he'd call me riiiight back and let me know what was going on (remember this is 830) Two hours later and 3 phone calls back to them, he told me to call back at 2 and speak to Jamie (great another Jamie problem to deal with).&nbsp; I told Dave that I was not happy and that we've never had anything go smooth with any of the Thomas Dealerships (Kia or Dodge) and that it was always a huge hassle. I told him that he'd better be glad I called up there before I came, because had I come up there and had to sit with 3 kids, they would have had a VERY unhappy female on their hands---poor guy had no idea what to say... Anyway, yeah, so 2 o'clock rolls on and I call the dealership. I had about a 5 minute run around with the girl who answers saying that Jamie would just end up transferring me back to her anyway, so I mine as well talk to her. I told her he'd best not do that and I'd like to speak to him NOW, please. So she finally got him on the phone and he said, "Oh yeah, you were supposed to come in" I told him what went on that morning and he said, "Well we dont do that work here, we send it down the street". I asked him why he didn't tell me that and why did he say that they'd have to order it? He never gave me a direct answer but played it off like it was me who was the idiot for not going in.&nbsp; *deep breathes* SOOOoooo, we will be trying this again on Thursday.  Ok, I must go now and pick up my husband from the train station so he can enjoy this terrible mood that I am in. God, I feel sorry for him, bless his heart:( &nbsp;

      Well, what to rant about first?&nbsp; My weekend was one of complete ups and downs. &nbsp; Starting off with last Friday.&nbsp; I got to work, called Aliant to find out what was going on and low and behold, they'd fixed all my phone bill problems!&nbsp; That's a big woo hoo!&nbsp; Then some good stuff happened here at work regarding some bad stuff that had gone on last week.&nbsp; I wasn't directly involved, but part of my job was.&nbsp; But they got it all fixed.&nbsp; I got some major praise from my boss on a letter regarding a union raise, which I luckily get.&nbsp; But on top of that letter, was a little note from some anonymous person, which read "Thank you for being so helpful and patient with my computer problems.&nbsp; You show so much more patience than some of your fellow staff members."&nbsp; I felt really good that people appreciate that I try to be friendly with everyone and as patient as possible.&nbsp; The day whiddled on and I got some work done, working with Scott most of the morning and some of the afternoon.&nbsp; When 4:30 rolled around, I was quite pumped and excited.&nbsp; Scott and I rolled out, to head to the 'pop shop' to grab some beverages for the small trip we were going on this weekend.&nbsp; &nbsp; On arrival in the parking lot, Scott's cell rang, with Sue telling Scott to tell me to call home asap.&nbsp; That's when I found out my Grandmother Cameron had passed away peacefully in her sleep.&nbsp; She had been running a temperature of 38 degrees or more most all of last Friday.&nbsp; My parents had been called up to sit with her at 5am that day.&nbsp; So my 'high' came to a crashing end.&nbsp; We had had plans to do a lot of stuff on the weekend and I was unsure of what to do.&nbsp; My parents only had a minute to talk, because they had appointments to keep.&nbsp; So I was left sitting on the outside looking in for the next 2 hours while I awaited their return home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott, Sue and I, along with some other friends, had plans to see a musical performance that night, called Good Vibrations, and I really wanted to go to meet a few of the other people (all girls, of only one which I was interested in meeting).&nbsp; So when my parents and I talked, we decided that I would not go home for the funeral.&nbsp; And after talking some more, my Mom broke down.&nbsp; And much to my chagrin, I had to break down and tell her that since my plans for B10 had fallen through, that I was coming home on August 2nd.&nbsp; That cheered her up very much and made my night.&nbsp; So off to the performance I went, met some new friends and enjoyed the 3 hours of live folk music covers! &nbsp; Saturday, Scott, Sue and I were up and away for the fireworks display in the Crows Nest Pass called "Thunder in the Valley", which is in the valley of the mountains.&nbsp; Along on our trip, was Amanada, who had been out with us the night before and going to see the fireworks with Susan and friends from work.&nbsp; We had an interesting day, enjoyed the fireworks and had a really great time.&nbsp; I was totally doing my own personal celebration of my Grandmother's life, totally enhaling liquor like it was going out of style.&nbsp; I apparently was described as a cute cuddly bear, a total riot, and that crazy guy from down East.&nbsp; I'm glad I kept everyone quite amused and that only Scott, Sue and Katherine (Sue's friend from work, who's parents house we were all staying) knew that I was kinda in the dumps.&nbsp; I had a great time and enjoyed myself, even if some&nbsp;engaged beaver somehow found it's way out that night.&nbsp; I had mentioned to a couple of other people that night what had happened, but only the people who I knew a bit better and was comfortable talking to, like Katherine's bf, Lucas and Amanda, who was quickly becoming a friend.&nbsp; She's from 'down East' too and was a nice reminder of home for me. &nbsp; Sunday we came back, I talked to my parents several times throughout the day about the wake and how things went.&nbsp; It's suprising that close to 300 people went to an old woman's wake.&nbsp; My parents were so happy to see friends, family and people come to give their condolances for an 'old woman' that people had probably forgotten about. &nbsp; Monday, I took a bereavement day and waited patiently by the phone (as in I slept) until my mother called to let me know that the funeral had gone ok and that the Minister and a family friend had done a beautiful job with the service and the eulogy respectively.&nbsp; &nbsp; Today, I'm back to work, and things are starting to sink in.&nbsp; I've always been the 'rock' in my family.&nbsp; The one who can bottle it all up, until after everyone is ok and things are settled.&nbsp; Then I have my break down.&nbsp; I'm sure in the next day or two, it will come at some inopportune time and I'll feel like a jackass.&nbsp; Only management and my co-workers know what happened. &nbsp; But on a perky note, I'm feeling much better now that I've spammed you all with lots of useless crap, that most of you will have known or not and that it's all off of my chest.&nbsp; So I will be blogging again soon, but until then, &nbsp; Tune in next time, same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!

      &nbsp; I hate diets. I've always hated dieting. I love to eat, LOVE to eat. My fridge is stocked, I have a separate freezer to hold the mounds of steaks and chicken breasts I eat. I even took culinary classes in college to learn how to cook better. &nbsp; On the same note I love health and fitness. I run about 30-35 miles a week, I lift weights an hour a day and I do strenuous stretching three times a day. &nbsp; On a third note I hate doctors and I hate going to the doctor. I've well known as someone who gives doctors and nurses a hard time and I'm generally difficult to perform the simplist checkup. &nbsp; So needless to say last week I'm in the doctor's office and the nurse (god bless her) is getting a usual earful from me about why she's doing this and I'm paying the doctor when all he does it come in and give me a pat on the shoulder before telling me to come back in six months. She smiles because she knows I really give him a hard time about doing the things mentioned above and getting paid large sums for this. &nbsp; Anyway, I step on the scale and it reads 246, around 15 pounds above my weight. 15 Pounds!...Well the scale must surely be broken and I'm not level the office until I get a second reading from another scale...Hmm 246 again...I go to one of the supermarket scales and it's 246...Sonofabitch...246 pounds...Well I don't feel any different, I don't look any different and my clothes fit the same...So what the fuck? &nbsp; Well apparently I'm getting older and my eating habits are that of Corey at 24 instead of Corey at (soon to be) 29. So I was told to research my eating routine for the last 10 years and examine how much it changed. &nbsp; Most people don't have a documented eating routine from 10 or more years but doc knows that I used to play college football (actually I got a scholarship for playing college football and flamed out with a knee problem) and I saved my eating plan from that and actually reduced my food intake based on that chart about six years ago. &nbsp; So for the end of part one, I'm going to give you my eating schedule when I was 18 years old at the University of Tennessee, where I was on scholarship to play football. Now the football program had a group of nutrition and health workers to keep us on our schedule six days a week (Sunday was an official junk food day)...The food intake is borderline scary but be reminded that it was made for me to gain about&nbsp;25-30 pounds and get from my high school weight of about 215 to the weight of a football linebacker...So here was Corey's daily schedule as taken from my file (I'd scan it but my scanner ain't cooperating) &nbsp; &nbsp; 6:30 a.m.&nbsp; Voluntary Cardio workout &nbsp; 7:10 a.m.&nbsp; Weight training &nbsp; 8:00 a.m.&nbsp; Breakfast (Mushroom omelet of 6 eggs (4 eggs whites, two full eggs) side of potatoes or grits, two slices of wheat toast, one glass OJ, one glass skim milk, and as much water as he wants; Three days a week I had mushroom, three days a week I had a cheese omelet and a side of turkey bacon). &nbsp; 9:00 a.m. I think I had a class...or an angioplasm... &nbsp; 10:00 a.m.&nbsp; Mid-Morning snack (Oatmeal with banana, strawberries, brown sugar, and milk). &nbsp; 11:00 a.m. Probably had a class...or went to the bathroom. &nbsp; 12:30 p.m. Mandatory cardio workout (yay, running in 95 degree Tennessee heat) &nbsp; 1:00 p.m. Lunch (Two sandwiches [usually turkey, tuna&nbsp;or roast beef for me] and two bowls of fruit and at least two glasses of water) &nbsp; 2:00 p.m. Probably had a class [My class schedule ended at about 3 every day] &nbsp; 3:15 p.m. Specialized health shake (Usually some blueberry, banana, honey mix with too much protein powder) &nbsp; 3:30 p.m. Practice &nbsp; 6:30 p.m. Dinner&nbsp;(Two grilled chicken breasts (or a big steak/prime rib if I was lucky), two baked potatos, two vegetables, some sort of bread. At least two glasses of water and a glass of icea tea: On two days I'd usually have a heavy dose of pasta and salad).  &nbsp; 9:00 p.m. Late Evening snack (Usually a couple bowls of fruit) &nbsp; Okay that was what I was forced at 18...In Part 2, I'll tell you about my necessary diet and my high cholesterol (SURPRISE!) &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I usually am a strong opponent of tobacco. I really don't like the stuff.&nbsp; As a teen, I did try a few cigarettes under peer pressure, but only as in the Bill Clinton "didn't inhale" style.&nbsp; Tonight, I ran into my first new experience with tobacco in many a year.&nbsp;  &nbsp; After work, I sometimes go to a pool hall where I will play a few games and talk to people.&nbsp; Tonight, after a few games, the people I were with pulled out a small can and began doing their ritual of pouring two spots of powder onto the back of their hands.&nbsp; This powder was snuff. I have seen them do it before, but have refused to take part in it before.&nbsp; Before, I could say anygthing, somebody had already poured it onto the back of my hand and I realized I was in this round.&nbsp; Oh well..I have always learned, as was the case with alcohol, if you just do it once, people will get their kick watching you do it and then will leave you alone.&nbsp; So I decided to do the snort and just get it over with. &nbsp; To my surprise, it was nothing like tobacco, but rather more like a "Fisherman's Friend" backed up into your nose or a Vick's inhaler.&nbsp; Very strong methol rush.&nbsp; I even agreed to one more later in the evening.&nbsp; Hopefully, I am not addicted ;) &nbsp; As for web links, I won't bore you with details, but a few that I visit regularly include &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.google.com &nbsp;- I like the news summaries here as there is always more than one version of the story. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.cnn.com &nbsp;- A fast roundup of the news, but usually they have a headline dealing with Iraq which is a real turnoff to me. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.cinescape.com &nbsp;- A sci fi /fantasy movie and tv website done by the publishers of the magazine of the same name. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.trektoday.com &nbsp;- A daily roundup of all the latest Star Trek news. &nbsp; Nothing too much more interesting to post!

      Welcome to the second edition of "Adventures with Kitties" starring Tigger as "Little Bastard" and Pooh as "Little Bitch"!    In today's episode, it is early Monday morning and I've just gotten out of the shower. As I am applying moisturizer to my skin I hear some strange sounds coming from the living room. I walk towards the sounds and immediately see Tigger sitting up on the ledge looking down at the front door. At what? I have no clue. Its obviously a cat thing.    I walk a bit further in and see that the cover is off one of the heating vents on the floor near the living room window. My first thought is "Crap, Pooh is in the vents!" so I walk over, remove the whole thing and start calling to her. I hear nothing. I'm wondering what to do and I consider getting the catnip as bait for her. I replace the cover for the vent because god knows Tigger would certainly climb in (he's done it before). I turn around and, to my surprise and amusement, there is Pooh outside at the back door meowing to get in.     I let her in but I'm a bit puzzled as to how she even got out there. As far as I'm aware, I don't think the vents lead outside - at least not that quickly/directly. The only other option I can think of is that she went through the living room window. See, we don't have a screen on that window just yet - and last night I left it slightly open so as to let in the cool night air. The thing is that it wasn't open any more than 3 inches but maybe thats enough. If she did escape that way she had quick the long drop down!    Cats are just weird.  Or maybe thats just our cats :)    Anyhoo, today I feel normal. And what I mean by that is that we went to a wedding this weekend and I got really nicely toasted - so I'm now feeling non-alcoholic and, thus, normal. Its been quite some time since I had that much wine - and it wasn't even all that much! I guess we've got to get into "condition" before Canadameet though! ;)    So now Adam and I are thinking of doing something for the long weekend in August - but we're not sure just what yet. Maybe camping? We might just go back to Sullivan Lake or maybe do something else. Suggestions anyone? It has to be something close to here as we're trying to save $$ to renovate our upstairs bathroom.    But now I must get ready for work... Ciao!

      Well then. I haven't posted in a while now, and apparently my loyal fanbase is demanding that issue be rectifyed with all due haste. I'll skip the trials and tribulations of my personal life for the moment (and frankly, if you don't know me, why do you care anyway?) and instead jump to the meme at hand -- namely, where I surf on a regular basis.    Morning tends to start with a bit of cereal and  dose of the real news from...   urlLink CNN  - well okay, this is more like news-lite, but it at least tells me the world hasn't blown up overnight.   urlLink The Seattle Post-Intelligencer  - one of the two daily papers here, and IMHO the more even-handed.  And of course, as Melia mentioned,  urlLink Fark ... your one-stop shop for Discussion/Weird News before it gets posted there.    So then it's off to work.  My exciting work-related links feature some of the following...   urlLink University of Washington  - They give me a student ID, I get discounts places.  It's a great relationship.   urlLink Dept of Genome Sciences  - My department.  Find my awful ID badge picture in the Students section.   urlLink FlyBase  - The one-stop shop for all  Drosophila melanogaster  related biological information. Everything from the complete genome sequence to proteomic interaction information. Look up your favorite gene, like  cheap date  or  Npc1b  (the gene I work on!)  urlLink  National Center For Biotechnology Information  (NCBI) - the National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine clearinghouse for all biomedical science information. Contains sequence for practically every organism that has any DNA sequenced, protein sequences, scientific journal references, etc.  urlLink  Entrez-Pubmed  @ NCBI - The Google of biomedical scientific journal article references. Handy for when you want to look up if anyone has studied the effects of excessive internet usage on brain tumor formation.    Well, work's boring. So I've got plenty of fun bookmarks around to keep me occupied and looking like I'm busy annotating some DNA sequences or something.  I'll spare you the tcz ones and move along.   urlLink BBspot  - A daily satire site that also features links of the day to all sorts of entertainment, flash games and the like.   urlLink NationStates  - A website spun-off of Max Barry's book Jennifer Government. Create your own nation and rule it with an iron fist as legislation passes your desk. Come join us in the TCZ region.   urlLink Digital Archive Project  - An online project to use eMule for good instead of evil. These wonderful people have gathered listings of all sorts of quality television programming that has gone off the air and is not available for sale in proper (VHS or DVD) formats, and provides the information and wherewithal to download episodes in AVI format for your personal viewing pleasure. Their most popular item is the entirity of MST3k, but other things include most of the series from Adult Swim on Cartoon Network, and some classic shows like Pete &amp; Pete.   urlLink Sluggy Freelance  - Worship the comic.  If I was able to get Fire hooked, I can get you hooked as well.   urlLink KEXP 90.3  - A local independent music station that's almost entirely listener-supported. The breadth and depth of this station are almost beyond words, and their website is a work of art. They have shows ranging from indie rock to jazz to reggae to African beats to electronica to rockabilly. They offer live streaming of all their broadcasts in numerous formats (including 1.4 mbps uncompressed!), a two-week streaming archive of all shows and permanent archives of the numerous artists who appear and do in-studio performances. They also have the honor of being the first group to ever wean money out of me at a pledge drive multiple years running, so that should tell you something about their quality.    Nerd links (because who doesn't have a few hiding in their bookmark folder?)   urlLink National Earthquake Information Clearninghouse  (USGS) - Near-realtime listing of all moderate-to-major earthquakes on the planet, with all sorts of geological and historical information to boot.   urlLink Operational Siginifcant Event Imagery  (NOAA) - Cool imagery from NOAA weather satellites of things like hurricanes, forest fires, floods and other funkiness. Lots of good candidate desktop background images.   urlLink Astronomy Picture Of the Day  (NASA) - A new and often damn cool astronomy-related picture every day. They often have beautiful images from Hubble and the numerous other telescopes now peering deeper and deeper into the far reaches of the universe. Also lots of potential desktop backgrounds.   urlLink Jet Propulsion Laboratory  (NASA) - The home of the Mars Rovers and Cassini mission to Saturn, among other interstellar adventures. Another site for all sorts of cool space-related photographs.   urlLink The IHOZ Interstate Page  - The most comprehensive listing of US Interstate information around. I can't believe I just admitted to bookmarking this site, either. But wait...   urlLink Kurumi's 3di page  (that's three-digit interstate, if you were wondering.) - That's right, information on all 3di's in the USA. Ever wonder how many Interstate 295s there really are? (seven.) Plus all sorts of historical information about highways that never got built for various reasons.    Right. That'll do you all for the time being, along with some others that have already been mentioned below. Now go off and learn all about the weird history of Interstate 90. Next post, three weeks.

      Current Tune: UK import  urlLink Jamie Curram  singing a Neptunes cover. This guy sounds like a soulful Harry Connick without the talent that Harry Connick has.   I'm always a little wary when people ask for my bookmarks because...well frankly not everything I see I want to share.   However I like most of you so I'll oblige with just a few of my favorite daily stops. Now just so you know I'm a news guy, I'm a sports news guy and most of my day revolves around my career, which comes through in my links.    Newspapers:  All the news that's fit to print.    urlLink The New York Times:  The gray old lady is still going strong. I usually hit the front pages and the Arts section after I get up and wash my face. Occasionally I'll check sports if Bill Rhoden has a column or Chris Broussard has a notebook but usually I check sports at...     urlLink Newsday:   Newsday is the only other non-tabloid in the New York Metro area (they are based out of Long Island). The  urlLink New York Daily News  and  urlLink New York Post  are the most famous tabloids in the world excluding Europe. The Newsday gives me the information I need on the Mets, Jets, and Islanders. A lot of the baseball stuff is reaching as the Times has all the good baseball writers, but they try. And also they are the best source for anything Amy Fisher.     urlLink The Ledger:   It's the local paper. I'm pissed because they still aren't sure if they are going to pick up my column and at times the stories are so single-focused that anyone outside of Central Florida couldn't relate. However a lot of my friends work here and they are good people.     urlLink St. Petersburg Times:   St. Pete used to be the best in Florida but now they are merely the best in the Tampa Bay area. Excellent features and business section.     urlLink Knight-Ridder Election Coverage:   This is links to all things 2004 election from the Knight-Ridder group of papers (Miami Herald, Philly Inquirer, etc.). They should be getting active in the next few weeks with the conventions kicking up.     News-Based Websites:  All the news that's 90% correct half the time.    urlLink  CNN:   Cable News Network is still the best and most respected in the business. It's not quirky and tacky like FOX but CNN doesn't employ Sean Hannity and that's a good thing.    urlLink  Google News:   I prefer this over Yahoo because they link wire and newsprint stories (which are usually copies of the wire story). And it's separated by topics. For Google updates you can check the unofficial  urlLink  Google weblog  .    urlLink The Smoking Gun:   The gun is as good as anyone in finding the great odd police blotters. It's where I found much of my material in the Debra Lafave sexual assault case.     Sports:  It's what I'm all about.     urlLink ESPN:   It's chicken soup for the sports lovers' soul. They are roughly three minutes faster on breaking sports news than the Associated Press because AP has to get clearance from their National Wire Editor before posting a bulletin.    urlLink  CBS Sportsline:   Not as good as ESPN but they have many more free options and a free rumor mill, the little things that ESPN makes one pay an insider fee for.     urlLink Sporting Fools:   This is my site that I run with AP Writer Mike Branom. We'll throw some current sports news up there and occasionally relay our opinions.  &nbsp;  urlLink  Ralph Wiley:   One of the best sports/culture writers of my generation. Wiley passed away in June, a week before I would be able to see him. I can read his ESPN.com archives here.  &nbsp;  urlLink  Bill Simmons:   Bill Simmons, once known as the Boston Sports Guy, is part sports, part entertainment. One of the last remaining NBA fans on earth and he enjoys The Karate Kid and gambling as much as I do. ESPN.com finally gave him his own page.     Entertainment:  Because Man Can't Live on News and Sports alone.      urlLink Electablog:   The best political blog on the net. It's run by Dave Pell and it's a cross between The Daily Show and Hardball. Excellent stuff.     urlLink Drudge Report:   I can't call this news because Matt Drudge is a Bush-flag waving jackass who can't break a story for shit. Despite Matt's pathetic attempts at being a journalist (all the while being an hourly insult to those of us who work hard in the profession) some things on his site are pretty funny. I take him with a grain of salt.     urlLink IMDB:   Whenever I'll looking to see if my proposed Billy Zabka/Frank Stallone/Charlie Sheen movie project will ever come to fruition. I look here.     urlLink College Football News:   I really can't call this sports because it's a fan site. However it's got Fox's backing and the webmaster is writing stuff in The Sporting News on the side. Overall it's a very impressive fan site dedicated to college football.     urlLink Soul Sides :  GREAT Audioblogger for the obscure lover of Hip-Hop, Soul, R&amp;B, Jazz and anything cultural from this era and the older days.     urlLink Whiskey Bar:   Political discussion disguised as bar discussion. Billmon was a lot more fun until he got caught up in the fraud known as the Bush Administration.     urlLink Warchant:   When I want to discuss the athletics of the greatest school on earth -- Florida State University (Nah, I'm not bias).     urlLink Talk Left -- The Politics of Crime:   All things for the bleeding heart liberal in all of us.     urlLink Air America Radio:   All things for the bleeding heart liberal in all of us, but who's too lazy to read the words on Talk Left.     urlLink Blog Maverick:   Mark Cuban's weblog. Cuban is a self-made billionaire and the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks franchise. His tips on business skills are often useful.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Games:  You all know, I play a little. &nbsp;  urlLink  Joystiq:   It's all about the video games here. Updates on new games, new systems, some demo shots.  &nbsp;  urlLink  XBox 2:   Unofficial weblog for the upcoming Microsoft system. I am an XBox owner and it is the greatest video game system on earth. I will not argue this. However if you perfer... &nbsp;  urlLink  Playstation 3:   ...that buggy, slow crap from Sony. I like to read up on the enemy as well. Generally these two weblogs have similar information.  &nbsp;   Travel:  /o~/I'm an everywhere man...I'm an everywhere man../o~/ &nbsp;  urlLink  Cheapo Vegas:   If you know me, you know I love Las Vegas. I've actually been able to call my last few Vegas trips work as I've covered boxing events there. Cheapo Vegas is a funny, informative site that gives you the real dirt on all the hotel/casinos in Sin City.  &nbsp;  urlLink  Las Vegas Advisor:   This is Anthony Curtis' tip site. I pay the few bucks a month to get an actual newsletter because they include many deals and coupons. I actually stayed at Mandalay Bay for $59/night one time thanks to a secret deal uncovered by Curtis. The free site is fine, check out the top 10 deals.   That's about all I look at everyday. Hopefully you'll check some of them out.

      Well, since Melia just absolutley ADORES creating time consuming memes, I'll just have to add my tuppence to this.  &nbsp;   Movies:   &nbsp; urlLink Aint It Cool News &nbsp;which is actually run on a really crappy server that is barely running half the time (Much like TCZ) and by an egotistical fat man (Much like TCZ) with a penchant for being very dirty about the most stupid things (Much like most TCZers)  &nbsp;   urlLink Dark Horizons &nbsp;is a FAR better website for news and gossip relating to upcoming movie projects and the like. He also has quite good interview skills and his reviews of movies seem very close to my opinion. He's yet to let me down heavily, unlike Big Fat Harry from Aint It Cool  &nbsp;   urlLink Apple Movie Trailers &nbsp;contains Quicktime trailers of all the latest movies coming out in a format that just blows the pants off of any streaming technologies like WMV and Real. They also have a lot of older movie trailers (circa 1998) for those who want to laugh about how bad movies used to be, way back when.  &nbsp;   urlLink IMDB &nbsp;is THE definitive resource for movie information. Ever wonder who played that guy, who did that thing, in that movie that year...This is where to look.  &nbsp;   Geek:   &nbsp;   urlLink Slashdot &nbsp;is news for nerds, stuff that matters...even if most the time it's just endless debate over how horrible Microsoft is and how our rights are being infringed every day of the week! Some decent nerdly stuff comes out occasionally though.  &nbsp;   urlLink Spiderfan.org &nbsp;is probably the best compendium of Spiderman related information anywhere.  &nbsp;   urlLink Gamespot , full of reviews, previews and information on any kind of game you can think of. Requires a subscription for some of the best stuff, but I'm cheap so I don't bother  &nbsp;   Blog:   &nbsp;   urlLink CMON &nbsp;is a bunch of hippies trying to compete with the local telco (that I work for) except their business plan is very dodgy. They recently got a whack load of money to do a feasibility study to see how much of a sucker local governments are (Ok, I mean to say they got money to study whether or not their business plan is feasible...talk about a loaded study, what are they going to say, "No, this is impossible, you'd waste your money on us if we did this")  &nbsp;   urlLink Doug Alders Blog &nbsp;is an old boss of mine that writes his conspiracy theories and complains about being old. I like reading it just to think I'll never be that bitter :)  &nbsp;   urlLink Belt0033's Blog &nbsp;is a&nbsp;boob. Plain and simple. An idiot who thinks he's smarter then he really is.  &nbsp;  This one, I like TCZ  &nbsp;   Community:     &nbsp;   urlLink Conservatism &nbsp;is full of people who espouse how great Bush is and how dumb Democrats/Liberals are. Run by a complete MORON (Belt0033) who will sooner ban&nbsp; you then even attempt civility.  &nbsp;   urlLink Republicans &nbsp;is full of people who espouse how great Bush is and how dumb Democrats/Liberals are. Not run by a complete MORON (I think he was banned for being too much of an idiot)  &nbsp;   urlLink Liberal &nbsp;is full of hippies who like to say all corporations are evil and that we should all just love each other.  &nbsp;   urlLink Martial Art &nbsp;is the community I started to get people interested in martial arts. I try to ask a question a day for people to respond to, trying to get people involved, trying to learn more, etc.  &nbsp;   News:     &nbsp;   urlLink Rush Limbaugh , you probably know who he is. Incredibly intelligent man, always right, etc etc.  &nbsp;   urlLink The Drudge Report &nbsp;is run by Matt Drudge, an internet muck-raker who is more often more wrong then right.  &nbsp;   urlLink Media Matters &nbsp;takes words spoken by Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'reilly and Fox News and unspins it with information backed up with facts. Rush and Bill both respond with the "left wing conspiracy" that is Media Matters  &nbsp;   urlLink Fox News &nbsp;is fair and balanced  &nbsp;   urlLink Canada.com &nbsp;is chock full of information about how much Canadians hate the US, how much the war in Iraq is failing, how ahead of the polls is Kerry against Bush, oh, and sometimes they mention Canada.  &nbsp;   urlLink Bowling For Truth &nbsp;is the Anti-Michael Moore site that started it all. Takes everything said in Bowling for Columbine and attempts to explain it away.  &nbsp;   urlLink Yahoo News &nbsp;is good for new&nbsp;information coming off the&nbsp;newswire. The message boards attached to a story are pretty entertaining too.  &nbsp;   urlLink BBC &nbsp;is some kind of news show.  &nbsp;   Comics:   &nbsp;   urlLink Penny Arcade &nbsp;pretends to be edgy, but all they come across as is big fat angsty computer nerds who occasionally do really good deeds (like getting their community to donate video games to sick kids). Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, they're based in Spokane WA, which is just across the border from us.  &nbsp;   urlLink Sluggy Freelance &nbsp;is THE webcomic. There is no match. Excellent art, awesome lorax humour.&nbsp;Worship the Comic. (The only webcomic I'd pay to get in hardcopy form)&nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink It's Walky , which is quickly coming to a close (The author is killing off all the characters to start a new series) was pretty good for a teen angst with superpowers kind of dealio. Then he got bored  &nbsp;   urlLink PVP Online &nbsp;has it all. Computer nerd, fat boss, 30-something hippy, two fat ex-jocks..All in comic form. Art is really good (although it's just copy and paste of various poses that have been drawn before). Quite funny and pretty fresh.  &nbsp;   urlLink User Friendly &nbsp;is everything PVP isn't. The art is crap; it's boring, repetitive and overly nerdy. Used to be a big thing back when everyone hated Microsoft (The whole comic is basically office culture and nerd humor, much like PVP). Most people don't like User Friendly anymore, but I used to work with a couple of these guys, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  &nbsp;   urlLink College Roomies from Hell &nbsp;is drawn by a chick, and is basically the same plot line of It's Walky. Teen angst with superpowers.  &nbsp;   urlLink Sinfest &nbsp;is the edgy comic that Penny Arcade wants to be. Deals with god, satan, sluts, presidents, ninjas, pigs and overbearing Christian parishioners. Love it.  &nbsp;   urlLink Cagle's Political Cartoons &nbsp;is a compendium of various newspaper artists who do political satire comics. Sometimes it's better then the actual news.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I think that's enough for now. Melia's going to kill me for spamming the board again.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So I'm a little behind the times I guess, when it comes to reading  urlLink fark.com . I think it's a nice site, funny etc. but I also think it depends on a person's mood as to whether they want to invest themselves in having yet another website they have to check daily (or even hourly depending on how fast a site moves.) &nbsp; I think everyone who spends significant amounts of time on the internet has their 'usual haunts' and they make the rounds quite often. It might be a forum for a favourite band, or *cough* even your favourite group blog :) Maybe throw in a few news sites, entertainment sites and even a work-related site or two. It just varies with each individual. &nbsp; So what are your haunts? Show us your bookmarks :) &nbsp; What does this have to do with Fark? Oh well it's just been added to my list of daily stops. I know everyone and their dog has been reading Fark for years, but better late than never eh? &nbsp; So, here are my rounds, not necessarily in order: &nbsp; - Saint Francis &amp; Wellness Works - work sites.  -  urlLink Theindependent.com / urlLink Indie forums&nbsp; - my town's newspaper &amp; forums -  urlLink Emotion Eric forums  - I adore Eric and the forums there are fun. I mostly lurk though. - TCZ Blog/tcz.org - duh - All my stuff - I have a bit of a network of sites of my own I check to see the stats etc. A couple of forums for my show that I run (one's busy, one isn't :), my own blog, my own site, my daughter's site etc. -  urlLink Television Without Pity  - Forums for a slew of shows on all networks. The Snarkiness never ends. - FOX 24 forums - where I find news and updates on the show and cast. - Dark Horizons,  urlLink Ain't it Cool  (shut up Fire) and  urlLink Zap2It &nbsp;- Movie news, and I only read Harry's site for movie updates, I swear :) -  urlLink IMDB  - I go here quite a lot looking up movie info and reading the entertainment news and stuff. -  urlLink The Cynic  - Seminole's blog. He doesn't update it often enough tho and when he's not carrying on about sports, there's funny stuff to be found here :) - Yahoo for my news needs - I like it because I can pick and choose the headline stories I want to read. I have UK &amp; Ireland news, world news, and of course, entertainment news. I usually head for this stuff during my lunch hour at work.  - Fark - already mentioned it :) - Online banking/email etc - boring stuff. When I'm feeling too happy I go look at my bank account. -  urlLink Snopes  - I loved bursting my boss' bubble when she sends me the Allstate Warning email. Thanks Snopes! - Gmail - Woot! Google rocks my socks. &nbsp; That's about it really. So when I'm idle on TCZ, I'm probably making my rounds :)

      So last night I'm in bed reading a book when I hear Tigger start to howl really loud.  I don't get up immediately because he's done that before just to annoy me, but then after the second howl I hear this kind of squeaking sound.  I pause and listen wondering what the heck it could be and then it comes to me that maybe he caught a mouse.  I get up, he's still meowing, and walk into the hall and there is this poor cute little bird!!!    I couldn't believe it.  He actually caught a bird - the poor thing.  I felt so bad yet wanted to also laugh at the cat.  He didn't really hurt it - so it seemed.  I mean, there were a few feathers out and it seemed unable to fly away right away but it also looked like it was completely in shock.  I walk over to the bird and call Adam up from downstairs and Tigger starts meowing all cutely and trying to poke at the bird as if to say "Like the present I brought you?"  So we shoo him away and Adam picks up the bird and we bring it out to the backyard.  What do you do with birds in this instance anyways? Its not like we had a birdcage lying around and could look after it.  We bring it out back and I try to check out its wing - nothing seems to be wrong (no blood).  It chirps, leaps out of Adam's hand and goes under the rhododendron bush.  We figured it well-covered under there, make sure the cats are in and leave it to calm down/sort itself out.    I'm still amazed that that evil little fat bastard caught a bird.  If anything, I thought I'd have a mouse on my floor before a bird but I guess I underestimated him.  What I'm really curious about is how he got it into the house.  I mean if he caught it outside he would have had to put it down, then open the screen door (as I had closed it), then pick it up again and bring it in the house.  Strange &amp; slightly talented kitty.  I blame Beanie - he picked the cat out!!    No worries though - I'm assuming the bird survived and is well - I checked under the bush this morning and it was nowhere to be seen.  I hope it was only in shock and recovered and flew away.  Stupid cat won't even eat chicken cat food and he goes after a bird... sheesh.    Anyways, I actually work today so its about time I went and blow-dried my hair.  Gotta find a dress for the wedding tomorrow too!  Later!

      I've been pretty slack the past few months where exercise has concerned and every month when my bank statement comes I've been pondering what to do about my gym subscription. Last night I finally came to the decision that I'm going to start going again, and so today I pootled down to the gym for a quick session on the cross-trainer and some sit-ups.   I've also gone so far as to book a gym induction session - the third one I have booked now, I just hope I actually get a training programme this time. The first time, I got told they wouldn't give me a programme until my chiropractor had signed some form saying it was ok for me to use the gym. The second time, the instructor cancelled, but I never got the message so ended up with another wasted visit. I'm hoping it's third time lucky!  So next week I'm planning on going to the gym and perhaps taking some classes in an attempt to start getting fit again. My plan to walk to and from work every day has been scuppered by the British summer - or rather the lack of it. A little old lady at the bus stop even asked me where the summer had gone and that she'd never known a summer like it. Personally, I think it's my fault. I've bought a few skirts recently and I guess the sun has decided it doesn't want me exposing my legs so has hidden until I give up the insane notion of wearing skirts :( It's not that I'm not a skirt person, it's just that I generally wear jeans. My mum always makes the comment "oh, you DO have legs then" whenever I wear a skirt, that's how rare it is. But my problem has not been a hatred for skirts, more a case of not finding a nice skirt, and now I have - about 4 of them! The next problem is finding shoes I can wear with them. Not sure trainers are going to match all my skirts...

      Anyway, not a good Wednesday. I can tell work is starting to pick up because I'm generally irritable and cranky all day. I don't like being in a bad mood because I'm such an easy going soul (almost too easy going if you ask some).   I'm really not going to go into why work sucked today because no one wants to read that. Instead I'll talk about why work is going to suck tomorrow. Well, I can't really do that with a clear mind because I want to think tomorrow will be a better day. I'm optimistic like that.   I already feel like I'm in the busy season. I haven't returned any of my friends' phone calls this week. I'm playing phone tag with a potential dating prospect and I'm working 12 hour mid-week days. This is not good and it doesn't bode well for the fall when things actually go live. I've said this before but I mean it this time, this is my last football season working. I'm going to try to switch over to baseball or something. The pre-season rush to do football previews is taxing. Baseball is more consistent and the travel is much better (albeit frequent). And...I'll actually have more time to attend TCZ Meets :)

      When I was about 8 I, like many other young girls, wanted to be a nurse...but a televised eye operation soon put me off. I then toyed with the idea of being a pilot and then wanted to be an aircraft engineer - I think that's coz my Dad was involved in building flight simulators. So here I am at 26 (almost 27!) and I'm none of those. I have an obscure job title (Learning Technologies Support Officer) and do a job that people don't really understand so they just say I work in IT. I used to be a researcher, which was much easier for people to understand until I told them what I researched and they got that glazed look.  So why am I telling you all of this? Well today was my annual review for my current job. I've been there just over a year now and the review was to see how things had gone and to set objectives for the future, it also involved re-doing my job description. So after 3 hours of talking to my boss I have a job description that matches what I do and a list of objectives that I can work on over the coming months. But one thing bugs me, much as I like my job, is it what I want to be doing in a year, 5 years, 10 years...? I don't know, I guess I'm just going to see what happens in my field of expertise (which incidently is online learning and is growing more widespread) and take things from there.

      Every year we get a new group of interns - basically students who come to work with my group for a few months for job experience and a bit of money.  The interesting thing about our latest group is that they are all women- quite an abnormality for engineering.  The three women are quite different.  2 Austrians and 1 Swede.  One is blonde (the Swede), one is brown-haired, and one is blue-haired!  The latter is quite unusual for engineering!  So now, my office, which has until this year, been "male-only", suddenly has more women than it does men!  Now, you would think with a bunch of women, the stereo type would be that the women would be talking non-stop with each other, and I would be able to get no work done, but these women barely talk to each other.  I took them to lunch today, and barely a word out of any of them to the other...I hope the ice eventually melts between them.  Its also interesting noting the differences in how they behave.  The Swedish woman feels much more comfortable in talking to me that the Austrian women - she also eats much more but is the thinnest.  I have yet to see the Austrian women have more than a simple cup of soup for lunch.    With one of the Austrians, I could not even get a smile from her. So I had to resort to desperate measures and blackmail her with ---- Gummi cola bottles!  At least that got me a smile from her :)    Anyways, at least the women are a nice break from the bald German man I used to share the office with ;)

      Sorry for posting again so soon, but I feel a lot better about my dilemma and wanted to share :)  A comment from my previous entry:  Do you want to give that up for the extra money and less time with your daughter?    Well it's not that, the new job would be the same as the one I have now. Same hours and all. I work 8am-4.30pm M-F and I have evenings and weekends with my daughter (well, plus I talk to her all day online during the summer. During the winter she's in school anyway.) So essentially I'd be doing the same job, same hours, for much more pay. My hangup is my loyalty to the hospital I work for. I love it here. But then, the opportunities for advancement and/or transferring to other parts of the country are better with the new job.   Anyway I appreciate everyone's input and I have followed some advice and taken on board other advice and looked at all my options. Today I spoke with my current boss about it because he the kind of approachable boss who has his employees' best interests at heart and he basically told me that the hospital would hate to see me go, but his advice was that I have to do what's best for me and my daughter, and if it means a change, it means a change. He said I shouldn't feel bad about leaving the hospital because you have to go where the opportunities are.  So I feel a hell of a lot better today. More optomistic at my chances to improve my life and my daughter's life. Thanks to everyone who's given me encouragement and advice on this. You've all been incredibly helpful!

      I have a problem with my job. It doesn't pay enough. I'm constantly struggling to pay the bills and I'm sick of it. But apart from the crap pay, I love my job. I like the people I work with, I love having my own office and I actually don't mind working for a large Catholic hospital.  My dilemma is that a job has opened up with my city's newspaper that is essentially the same job I have now, but it pays more. Close to 10k a year more. I wouldn't be living the high life, but I'd be a hell of a lot better off than I am now. I wouldn't have to scrounge for dimes and nickels to put a gallon or two of gas in my car. Ok maybe I exaggerate a little, but I am quite often strapped for cash and I'm approaching the time in my life where I shouldn't be anymore.  Next year I'll be vested at the hospital. My insurance is great. My boss is so easygoing I'm able to bring my daughter to work with me now and then and she can hang out in my office, or during summer holidays, my boss allows me to work from home one day a week so that she won't have to stay home alone as much. My paid time off accrues quickly, and if I'm sick, it's not a federal case if I miss a day. The boss and upper management of the hospital love me and have told me I have complete job security because no one else can do what I do.  If it wasn't for the pesky crappy payscale, I'd be even happier.   The job at the newspaper pays more, but I'd be working for Morris Communications which my mother has worked for and wasn't all that chuffed with. I don't have any idea what their health plan is, I'd probably lose having my own office... But the pay... :(  I can't decide if I should apply and face either rejection or having to tell my hospital I'm leaving, slyly let my current boss know I'm applying for that position in the hopes that they'd be desperate to keep me and bump my pay (which will never happen as in order to bump pay, Human Resources has to do a salary survey, management engineering would have to do a feasibility survey, and then they'd have to get a budget increase past Admin Council who are notoriously tight. Or should I just keep on with my current job and try to find a part-time, minimum wage piece of crap job that takes more time away from being with my daughter, keeps me so tired I dunno if I could function, and just plain sucks.  This sucks.

      Well today was full of surprises for me.  I almost forgot about a meeting that lasted about the entire day for me.  Then when there was an unexpected pause to be filled during the meeting, I was asked to give a presentation I had not prepared for...I managed to wing it of course.  At least spending the day in the meeting brought about an invitation to go to dinner with our guests from Italy. Only problem is I left my Passport back in Switzerland.  Now I don't need a passport to get from Switzerland where I live to Liechtenstein where I work, but I do need one to get to Austria where dinner was to be had.  Thus, I made a mad rush back to Switzerland and spent a hectic 20 minutes trying to remember where I had put my passport. Finally it was found next to my laptop..and off back to Liechtenstein and eventually to dinner.  At least 40 euros of food and wine and dessert were consumed..so I guess it was worth letting my salad go spoil in the refrigerator at home.  More mixed news with respect to the opposite sex. I got an acceptance for a lunch date, but the girl has now invited half a dozen people to come along..so its become a party almost..she even has included th girl I asked to play tennis with me later in the week. I gotta watch out..my world is getting too small!

      Well crap.  What a night.  What a weekend!  We ended up going camping to Sullivan Lake this weekend (just across the border) which was nice.  I love camping :)  We also went to the Gardener Caves and Boundary Dam so I have all kinds of photos that I'll load up once I find a crack for PSP8 :)  Anyhoo - I had some weird ass dream last night.  I was out walking and I wanted to go to 7/11.   I crossed the street and some guy was there and it went something like...  Guy: Where are you going? Me: 7/11 Guy: Oh, well it looks a little dark Me: Thats odd for a 24-hour store...  Then the guy looks at me, jumps me and tell me he is going to rape me.  So I'm freaking out and totally struggling against him and trying to scream but I don't seem to have a voice.  We end up wrestling down the street or something and I finally get this string to choke him but I still can't scream and people are just walking by doing nothing.  I'm trying to tell this guy in a drive-through window to call 9-1-1 but I can't yell so he can't understand me.  I kick the assailant in the head and start to run, but he recovers real quick and easy and comes after me.  But then I wake up.  WTF was that???  Dreaming about rape?  Damn.  Brutal.  Sucky night!  Let's see what the dream dictionary (www.swoon.com) has to say about this:   Rape : Whatever form it took in your dream, this act is a warning to avoid loose companions or careless behavior that could seriously damage your reputation by giving a false impression to those whose opinions are important to your welfare.    Fight : The basic meaning in a dream of fighting is change. For a business person, it signifies a change of enterprise; for an employed person, a change of job, etc. The degree of success or failure you may expect from the change was forecast in the outcome of your dreamed fight. If your dream concerned others fighting, it is a warning against waste of time and money in idle pleasure.   Laryngitis : To dream of losing your voice is a warning not to gamble or take any unnecessary risk for the next few weeks.  Well isn't that fun?  Sounds like a lot of warnings and a big flag that change is coming.  Whee!  Tell me something I  don't  know.  Stuff, bye.

      Figured I'd try my hand at these.   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  2003?  What a weird year.  I went back for what I assumed was my last term of university, taking 6 courses.  Algorithms, Social Ecology (philosophy arts elective), Stats, Computer Networking, Programming Languages and Numerical Methods.  I pass everything, but stats, which I needed to graduate and only failed by a couple of marks.  The prof wouldn't help me out a bit, that rotten *****.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   The word reality usually makes me thing of an old roommate of mine.  He was this little dorky kid my last year of residence that I lived with.  He needed a huge reality check.   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I try to live my life as honestly as possible.  When I was 12, I turned in a purse I found on the sidewalk to the police station (which was at the bottom of the hill) without opening it or checking out what was in it.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  With a free hour, I use it to watch TV.  I don't watch a lot of TV.  I try to fit in an hour of the Simpsons or something that usually makes me laugh.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   I've always wanted to smash a plate glass window, with my body being the thing smashing through it.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I would gladly put myself on the line for family members or friends or something that I firmly believed in.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Oi! Because you never knew what life would throw your way.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  This new ad for Holiday-In Express that has Alex Trebek doing this gay jeopardy situation.  This guy who hasn't gotten past grade 7 has like 17,000 dollars, one guy is at 0 and the other person is at -200.  The guy brags about how he stayed at a holiday in express the night before.  It's stupid and on all the time.   What was your first job?  I mowed lawns for people.  It was great.  It taught me responsiblity and my parents never needed to give me money from May til Oct.   Finish the sentence: “I have never...”  done one of these things before.

      The weekend has been a rainy one in Switzerland, so I decided to go about finally assembling the 5 dvd/cd racks that I bought a couple of weeks ago at IKEA.  A couple went together with no problem. The others were however were made by somebody who could not measure out the location of screwholes correctly, and thus took a bit more effort to put together.  Anyways, a few hours and sore thumbs later, I have 5 7 foot tall dvd racks completely full...and I need at least four more..so looks like another trip to IKEA.  Yes..I have way too many DVDs and cds.  I still have DVDs that have not been opened up. For all I know, they could be empty cases.  I sometimes wonder when I will have time to watch them all.  Sometimes, I think I am just saving things up for when I go into retirement. However, I am always buying more every weekend it seems!  Some sort of addiction I imagine.  The way I am going it will only be a matter of time before all of my white walls are completely covered with racks of cds and DVDs.  Boy, is it going to not be fun when I move..

      Well now that I'm done adding to my personal blog ( urlLink The Cynic ) and my sports blog that I run with AP writer  urlLink Mike Branom  appropriately titled  urlLink Sporting Fools . Now I'm ready for your questions and my close up.   Current Music:   urlLink Big Daddy Kane    Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ). : Great I picked up a quarter made from 1965. Hmmm...nothing happened to me in 1965 because I was 10 years away from being conceived. However my mom said she got a job in New York City with the phone company in 1965 and my dad was smoking hashish while working on his thesis at Penn. Works for me.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why? : My job. Working at a newspaper is instant reality. If I'm feeling too good I read the AP wire and hear about an explosion in Jerusalem, a beheading in Afghanistan and the war breaking out in central Africa. That's my often changing reality.   What is the most honest thing you have done? : I told one of the editors that I was embarassed about a story that ran on our front page. And she proceeded to include it in the weekly newsletter. Of course the girl who wrote the story cried and I looked like an ass. I apologized but that was a lie because I meant every word I said in the criticism.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why? : Maybe take a run on the beach with Metro and Boozer (my dogs).   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why? : A stack of Toby Keith CDs.    For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why? : My family, my ex-fiancee and my professional reputation.    What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why? : Eternal. Because death is forever.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why? : Any of those male  sex pill ads. Why? Because I can't imagine smiling that wide if your stuff is hard during an entire work shift. I mean I'd be a little embarassed if I'm strolling around the office standing at attention.   What was your first job? : My first work for pay was on the watermelon farms in rural Florida before several years before I moved here. My first job selling video games at Software Etc.   Finish the sentence: “I have never…” : I've never shagged Britney Spears. I've never bungee jumped. I've never swam but I always jump in head first.

      So, I just got back from a very relaxing stint outside the city, which definitely did me some good.  Unfortunately, I have to start work monday, which is simultaneously awesome and a bummer: awesome because I'll be getting money and I won't be broke, a bummer because I don't want to go to work.  But as much as I wish money would just pop out of my ears or something whenever I need it, it doesn't (nor does it pop out of my parents' pockets, ahem), so that leaves me to try and scrounge up my own cash. Bah.  Yesterday I read a memoir by Augusten Burroughs about the first sixteen years of his life and how he spent it living with a psychotic mother who then pawned him off on her crazy psychiatrist who ran a makeshift mental hospital from his beaten old victorian house, all the while engaging in an intense sexual relationship with a man more than twice his age.  The book is called  Running with Scissors , it's a good story and a quick read so I'd reccomend it (it's certainly one of the best memoirs that I've ever read, as the genre is by and large pretty boring and dry).  I also saw both Fahrenheit 9/11 and Spider-Man 2 recently (rather appropriately, I saw the former on July 4th!) and liked both of them.  Moore succeeds in making a really excellent propaganda film and luckily it's my propaganda so I'm happy to see it!  Although really, the important thing is that people go to see it and start actually  thinking  about the political situation rather than just blindly following or ignoring it all together, and I think Moore's film definitely does provoke thought.  The one problem I had with it is that I thought he critisized too many people, which I felt lessened the overall effectiveness of the film.  Focused critisizm is really important when making a statement, and it's one of the things that activists in general seem to have a hard time with (e.g., it can't just be anti-war, it has to be anti-war, anti-racism, anti-poverty, etc.). Spider-Man 2 was fun, just what I'd expect from the sequel to a movie based on a comic book.  Such has been my boring life of late.

      Well, ok that wasn't the question really, these are the questions and like a sheep I follow with my answers ;)   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  A one euro cent coin sitting on Monster's desk. It's sooo tiny I can barely read the date but it looks like 2002. Hrm, 2002, I was living in Manchester and experienced my first earthquake - and then about 30+ more as we experienced an earthquake swarm. Although the quakes were only tiny compared to the ones in Japan and California etc, they were still enough to wake me up or scare the hell out of me as everything shook about.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?  The phrase "Back to reality" which is the title of a classic Red Dwarf episode in series 5 - ok I'm a geek at heart ;)   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I can't think of one major honest thing that stands out really.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Laze around, watch tv, read a book, phone home, tidy up and spod ;) Depends on my mood really - and how good my latest book is!   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  I'd love to say there was some hideous ornament I would take pleasure in smashing, but I don't have one. Nor do I want to display my violent hatred towards any one person or object - so I guess I'll be topical in a sporting sense and say "I'd like to smash a winning volley at Wimbledon".   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  Hard to tell really until the situation occurs. Probably like most people, for my family and for my country.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Pedant. I guess because that sums me up :) I toyed with the idea of "dead" but then that might just be stating the obvious ;)   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  Bothers me? I can't think of any that really bug me atm.   What was your first job?  I delivered the local free paper. First off I helpd my friend with her round, then managed to get a round of my own that my sister helped me with. In the end I had two rounds a week (Tues and Thurs) - it was ok in the summer, but the dark evenings, the cold, wind and rain and having to lug round god knows how many papers - which a selection of glossy adverts - was a nightmare. Still it earnt me some money :)   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...been to Norway. Been to the rest of Scandinavia but Norway has eluded me thus far.

      Um yey well I didn't know what to blog anyway so yey for random questions! Here we go...   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   1992...hrm. I think I've killed off the braincells that can remember that far back. Doing the maths, that would have made me 10/11. I don't think I did a whole lot back then, certainly nothing I can particularly remember from that year... Now 1993 I started high school!   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?  Reality TV. But that's cos there's so much of it on TV these days and it's mostly a pile pile of pants :(   What is the most honest thing you have done?  Are there different values of honest? Being honest is just being honest, and I try to be as much as possible, even if it means saying that yes your arse does look fat in that!   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  If it's a spare hour off of doing something hectic then I'd probably snooze. I like sleep. Sometimes it's even better than sex! However I've had too many spare hours the past year so I tend to fill them with anything going.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  Well last week I was all for throwing Ginge's computer out the window...but only so I could have mine online instead. Now we have them networked I don't have to. Yey. Other than that I can't really think of anything right now... No PMS needing venting ;)   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I'm rather selfish and scared of death so I can't really imagine me beign all heroic. But if I really, really loved someone... you never know until it happens.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  BLONDE - sums me up really!   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  Those stupid Esure adverts with Michael Winner...nuff said!   What was your first job?  I waitressed in a smokery coffee shop...which has given me a taste for expensive smoked things, dammit. We got free lunches and got to take home leftovers (including yummy cakes and smoked salmon).   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...left Europe. I am trying to, and hopefully next year I will have saved some money for a North American tour! So watch out!

      One interesting thing about Europe in comparison to the USA is how much more important vacation is considered to be in Europe than the USA.  Whereas people in the USA are often asked to move their vacation to another time, in Europe vacation is sacred. So sacred that entire companies will close for weeks at a time so that all their employees can take vacation at the same time.  Now of course July and August are the favorite times for vacation.  This can be a great inconvenience if one does not have vacation him or herself during this time period and relies on other companies that do shut down for vacation to get work done.  Thus was the case for me. I find myself under pressure to prepare numerous steel samples for some experiments.  I have the samples cut at a laser company and I find that this company closes in the middle of July for 3 weeks..so I realize I had better get all these samples cut before they go on vacation. NOw to cut the steel, I first need the steel and I realize the guy who is going to get me the steel is going on for a month's vacation starting at the end of this week. Hence, I made a desperate dash today to pickup steel at the other end of Switzerland before his vacation began.  The trip started off nicely, but clouds quickly closed in, and just as I entered downtown Zurich, I noticed it was looking almost more like evening than lunchtime..the sky was that dark..not a good omen.  Next thing I know, my car is being pelted with hail and the streets of Zürich look like they are covered with snow. I worry about my dings on my hood and roof as well as not having an accident. Luckily, I survive, but have to repeat the process a few more times during the day.  I am always wary of hail storms as I remember a student who got killed at my university driving during one.  Luckily the actual retrieval of the steel was relatively painless.  Now to get it cut..that is tomorrow's wild trip ;)

      There are a number of things I'm seeing that sort of weird me out. On a few American cable networks, they've tried to enhance the viewer's movie-viewing experience with a separate 'show' that airs during commerical breaks. Sometimes it works, and sometimes you're left going, 'WTF?'  I was watching 'Die Hard' last night on F/X and it was one of those 'DVD on TV' type things where we have 'hosts' (male and female) to talk about the film during commercial breaks. I think TBS' Dinner and a Movie started this trend and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. DVD on TV is cool because they show a lot of deleted scenes and extras from a particular movie as it plays out and sometimes they come out with little tidbits about the film that aren't even on the DVD. I think that's cool.  Dinner and a Movie on TBS... sort of works because the phrasing goes together and has been around for a while, if you know what I mean. People have been going out for dinner followed by a movie for years. The format of this is a couple of hosts (again, male and a female) prepare a meal, usually one that's got a clever name related to the film they're showing, during the commercial breaks. There's witty banter, sometimes a guest chef or maybe even a no-name supporting actor who never really made it big.  This is all fine and dandy. But Movie and a Makeover? I think that's on Lifetime or Oxygen or something, but the hosts - yet again a male and female - 'makeover' someone, or something, like a room, during the breaks. What the hell? That's an odd combination.  And why always a male and female host? Covering their bases? Why - and this is what I really wanted to blog about - why is it always a dorky and/or dumpy guy and a hot girl? That's the weirdest trend I've seen lately and I've seen comments and articles about it. The hosts of DVD on TV consist of a hot blonde chick and a geek she wouldn't be caught dead with in a club. Why can't the guy be hot as well? Or better yet, hot guy, dumpy woman. Ok maybe not necessarily dumpy, though I'd have no objections about that, but at least a more realistic, natural woman instead of a tower of silicone, with a fake-bake tan and voluminous blonde hair.  Then there's the sitcom 'According to Jim' - Jim Belushi and... Courtney Thorne-Smith? Eh? I suppose the question is, are the execs at the Networks trying to help break down the stereotype of beautiful women only seeing beautiful men? Or is it just more like wishful thinking on their parts? You know those execs are all short, squat, George Costanza types dreaming of dating the hot chicks :) If they can't get one, they create a show that they can live vicariously through.  Now, don't get me wrong (and here's me covering *my* bases), I think it's great to have a TV show like Belushi's that breaks the stereotypes perpetuated by your soaps, your OC's etc. But it does seem like it's one extreme or another. Hot guy, average wife/girlfriend/host or vice versa. Let's have a little equal opportunity averageness/hotness. The perfect example that I can think of right now that's still on the air is Malcolm in the Middle. Okay the family's a bunch of nutters, but you're not going to find Jane Kaczmaerek working the runway (she's far too elegant for that) and the show's a big hit. 'Roseanne's another show where the stars were far from supermodel material and yet the country embraced it with open arms.  I'm rambling now and don't really know where I'm going with this so I shall stop that thread :) The only other thing that sort of had me dumbfounded last night was watching an ad for Denis Leary's new firemen show on F/X and in one of the clips from the show, a character says the word 'shitload.' I nearly fell out of my chair. 'Shit' is a BIG no-no word according to our censors so I was gobsmacked to hear it would be part of that show, *and* used in the advertising for it. Granted, F/X isn't one of the Big Three networks; it's a cable network, but one that comes with every basic cable package and therefore more accessible than say, HBO. So I'm wondering if censoring for those channels has relaxed at all or what's going on. I'm confused :) It's the same with another cable network, TBS which is showing Sex and the City now complete with a little nudity and the use of the word 'asshole'. Normally 'asshole' has 'hole' bleeped out.  I did find it amusing that F/X was showing a heavily edited version of 'Die Hard' where the 'God' in 'Goddamn' was bleeped out, yet let 'shitload' be uttered during a commercial :)

      Well, might as well answer the latest set of questions as I always do...   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).    Ok..its a Swiss 20 rappen piece from 1980.  Ah in 1980, my father bought our first home computer, and my life definitely took a slant in the geeky direction ;)    What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   I guess I think of the concept of a real life, one outside with others and with a real significant other.no computers or geeky engineering stuff that I spend my day doing.   What is the most honest thing you have done?   Call to the police to admit that I had made a prank phone call that had gone to far. I had to go to court because of it for "false reporting to authorities," but got let off.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?   Hmm..usually its try and organize my place or at least make a bit of progress with it.  If I am not at home though, I guess its just to catch up on a bit of reading    If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   Hmm..the speed bump I have to go over with my bike on my way to work and back.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?   Probably for a group of people that I cared about. I guess movies like Titanic try to make it look noble to sacrifice your life that way.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?   Thanks.  Hey, it was one interesting experience ;)   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?   Any of those pay per minute chat line ads that get repeated over and over during late night tv.   What was your first job?   Ok..outside of various yardwork type jobs, it would have been fabricating ceramic superconductors in a laboratory.   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  done an illegal drug   Ok..through that list of questions.  So what else is new besides having laid bare several aspects of my life, I finally worked up the courage to phone a woman up for a lunch date.  Although she told me she usually did not go to lunch, she agreed to make an exception in my case..so I was relieved there...still gotta set the date though.  Everyone seems to be going on vacation at work except me.  Looks like I may get stuck trying to figure out what to do with an intern whose boss will be gone for a month. Oh well, I am sure there is slave labor to be found

      I've been at a conference for the past two days and I wasn't really looking all that forward to it. It was in Loughborough which is a nice enough town in the East Midlands - about an hour and a half by train from London. So it was an early start on Tuesday having to leave the house at 7am, not nice especially since I'm never normally out of bed til 8.30! The conference was about Computer Aided Assessment - so getting students to do self-assessment and exams using a selection of online tests using objective question types (like multiple choice). Anyways, the conference papers were ok - some were great, others not so. The best bit for me was the evening's entertainment - a casino!  We were all given 4000 (fake - boo!) pounds to play with - apart from those of us who managed to convince the guy giving out the money that there really WERE two additional people sitting at our table ;) So I had 6000 pounds worth of fake money (boo!) in my pocket and headed to the poker table first, exchanging only 2000 to begin with. Started off ok, won a few hands - didn't win all that much but managed to get up to about 3500. Moved onto another table where they had wheel of fortune and managed to win another couple of thousand on that. So feeling lucky I moved over to the roulette table.   I bet cautiously at first, betting on odd, black and the occasional number or group of numbers, and I started winning. I'd managed to get up to about 18,000 (ooh and a bottle of champagne for having number 22 come up!) when I felt a bit tired and decided to try and lose all my money before retiring to bed. So I placed a few chips worth 5000 on various numbers round the board. Monster had texted me earlier and said to remember lucky black 3 - so out of loyalty I placed one on number 3 - it hadn't won me anything earlier in the evening, but what the heck I wasn't after winning. So the ball goes round and round and drops....into number 3! 175,000 (fake) pounds was mine! Highest win of the night....bugger, now I had to get rid of all that lot ;) Eventually managed to lose it all - it's amazing how quickly you can go from winner to loser, and toddled off to bed.  I'm hoping that lady luck will be looking out for me this saturday on the lottery superdraw :)

       Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   1993...Hmm, 13 years old. What did I do..Hmm. OH, here's a good one.  Ever year, schools from around BC have a kind of math championship. It's a source of great pride in a school to have people their. It's essentially like a jeopardy competition. But first, everyone has to write a test that will rank them 1-10 for the final competition. We do the test, a room full of kids ages 12-14, and I finish first...Mostly because I hate taking tests with a passion and want to get them over as soon as possible. After I finish the test, I sit around and wait for the guy sitting next to me to finish (as he's got a gameboy and the game he was playing looked neat..C'mon, I was a kid :)) He finishes, and we're sitting there playing gameboy and waiting for the rest of the people to finish the test.   Eventually, everyone finishes and we're told to go have lunch or some such nonsense while the tests are marked and we're given our rankings for the competition. We all troddle back inside and sit down and we're given our competitors for the final round. It turns out I was first seed (Yippy skippy) and will be playing against some chick who looks 2 years older then I do. We are seated in our chairs, with Jeopardy buzzers sitting in front of us linked to an alarm system with a light (So you know for sure who hit first). The puzzle goes up on the screen in front of you, and you've given 3 minutes, a pad of paper and a pencil to figure out the problem. I may not like tests, but I love competition so I get right down to it. I scribble out a couple calculations, slap my head with the OBVIOUSNESS of the problem, and with a big smile, put my hand up...while the girl next to me takes an extra second and hits the buzzer.  FUCK ME!  At any rate, I got kicked out first round, and the rest of the questions were pretty easy...*sigh*   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   Virtual. Completely and utter tripe. The closest thing we have to accessible virtual reality are those games you play in arcades. Y'know, with light guns or the big headsets that go over your head and you stand in the middle shooting at people. I like games like that (especially the boxing one, an excellent work out). I'm also very appreciative of those lightgun games that require you to duck and dodge and move. It's funny, video games would be an excellent way to make kids get off their lazy fat asses and do something (Look at the asians and Dyason with their Dance Dance Revolution!)   What is the most honest thing you have done?  Told someone I didn't love them and we should just be friends. I burst out laughing afterwards at just the clicheness of it. From then on, I vowed to break up with women the old fashioned way. Be a complete and utter misogynist pig, slap them around, drink a lot and sleep around! WOot!   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Read, browse, snuggle. The first two I can do on the internet, the second requires Christine. I like snuggling :(   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  TELUS management. I don't think they realize how many awesome people they have working for them, and the fact that they spend so much money doing stupid things like nightclubs instead of giving these people RAISES to keep them working hard just makes me want to start my own company up that treats all of its employees like gold, and kicks the ass of the big companies who haven't a clue how to remain a good company to work for.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  In the event of a world war, I'd be the first in line to sign up as a volunteer for my country. There's just something so valiant about feeling so strongly for a cause that you'd be willing to die to protect it. My grandparents all served in WW2, but none of my uncles or aunts did anything relating to Vietnam or Korea. I think it's my duty to have served in some way, shape or form.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  'OOPS', because I'll probably die in some hideously hilarious fashion that people for years will look back and shake their head at. Like, say, sneezing really hard and hitting my head on my desk, knocking myself unconcious and swallowing my tongue.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  TV, whassat?   What was your first job?   I delivered papers for about a week before I learned I have no respect for old people, nor am I very sure-footed on icy surfaces. I was delivering papers across the valley here in Fruitvale and I was a little too rambunctious.. I jumped down onto someones walkway, slipped and did a nice flying faceplant onto the ground. I hate flying faceplants :(   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...posted something on the TCZ blog that's less then 1000 letters and I dont think I'm going to start now :) HAH!

      Well I seem to be into answering all kinds of weird questions the last few days so I don't know why this should be an exception.  Here it goes:   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  Luckily, Adam is good at leaving coins all over the house.  Out of the pile on the desk I have a quarter that looks like its got blue ink on it - its from 1976.  The only thing that happened to me in that year was that I was born :)   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?  Bites?  Wasn't that a movie?   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I think the one of the hardest honest things to do is when you have a bit of information that you know could REALLY hurt someone and you still tell them.  Not because you want to hurt them, but because they're your friend and, as far as I'm concerned, thats what friends are supposed to do.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Back in the day it would have been something like walking on Kits beach, scrapbooking, or something of the like.  Now if I have a free hour I just want to be with Adam.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  The Bush Administration - starting with George Dubya himself.  HULK SMASH!!!   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I don't think there is any 'cause' that would make me want to do that - I'm pretty much opposed to war and that sort, but I would most likely do that for family - mine and Adam's.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Um, I think I'll be dead and I won't really care what is on it.  Although, it might be funny if it had something pertaining to evil stuff or world domination.     What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  I don't have cable so I wouldn't know :)   What was your first job?  Being that my dad was in the military, my mom always worked up at the mess halls doing military functions and weddings and such.  So I basically got a job as a waitress doing all this stuff.  It was actually quite fun sometimes as it was a pretty big military base and we'd always get these young Americans or some of our own militia.  Being a young girl, well, it was nice to drool over these guys or have them talk to you ;)   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...tried karate but will later tonight :)  Whee!

      So I kind of like answering these silly quiz questions. I don't know why. Maybe a strong desire to give total strangers a little insight into my inner being? I dunno. Anyway, I did a short list of ten questions from some sort of fun icebreaker things we do at meetings every now and then. Handy for those times when you don't really have anything to blog about :) You lot can answer them, or not, it doesn't matter. It's all in fun :)   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   Well I grabbed a quarter from 1998 which is easy for me :) That’s the year my daughter and I spent in Engerland. I worked for a Nazi who owned a pub/B&B in Little Hampden called The Rising Sun and we lived above the pub with the rest of the staff. Mondays in London were great :)   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   I end up thinking of reality tv because I watch a couple of them. Survivor when it’s on, and right now I’m kind of hooked on Blow Out on Bravo.   What is the most honest thing you have done?    I have done the ‘return the wallet with all the money still intact’ thing.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?   Depends on where I am. If I’m at work or something, I’d probably blog somewhere. If I’m waiting for an appointment, I’ve got a book. If I’m at home, I’d probably read there as well. Or play Spider solitaire on the comp.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   Easy. My fecking computer.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?   For a cause or something? I don’t know if I believe in anything that strongly. I’d be more apt to lay down my life for my family.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?   Mine would say ‘Byeee’ or maybe ‘WTF?’ or something silly.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?   Carrottop should be shot on site and never allowed to make another ad for 1800-CALL-ATT.   What was your first job?   I was an ice cream girl at one of those old-fashioned soda fountains on Cannery Row, in Monterey :) I could make 3 or 4 shakes, whip out a Fudgebana Split and throw an orgy together at the same time. They still talk of me down there. The legend that was Stephanie.   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  I have never, ever seen a single episode of the following: Baywatch, Melrose Place, The OC, The Apprentice, CSI-Anywhere, or Alias.

      Hidy Ho Good Neighbors:)  How was everyone's weekend? I feel like our's is still going because it's Tuesday and Paul is still at home:) I LOVE having my husband here at home:) I'm not ready for him to go back tomorrow. I've been spoiled.   Our weekend started out on Friday:) The kids and I picked Paul up from work early. It is impossible to go anywhere fast in the summer. It took us an hour and a half to get into Chicago. It usually takes, at the most, 45 minutes. Anywhoo, so we picked Paul up from work at 4pm and went to the Taste of Chicago:) It's Chicago's biggest festival. It runs from the Friday week before July 4th and ends at 9pm on the 4th. This year something like 4 million ppl showed up. Local restaurants set up their booths up and down Columbus Drive and around Grant Park. There are different stages for different performers and every night there is a big name that performs at the Petrillo Music Shell:)   WELLLLL, I was so excited because PAT BENETAR was performing Friday night:) So we got there and walked around for a bit. The kids got grapes and we got ice cream that was realllly soooo good:) After walking around the Taste for a little bit, we headed across to the lakefront and walked up and down there looking at the yachts and other assorted boats. Chicago is so pretty. The lakefront is amazing. If I didn't get so seasick from being on a boat, I'd have me a yacht and park myself out there all summer long. But, alas, I get sick just watching the boats bobble.*sigh*. The weather was gorgeous as well. It was the lower 70's and the wind almost made it a bit chilly:) We were leaving to come home and heard Pat Benetar come to the stage so we tottled on over to the Grant Park to watch and listen:) It was such a cool time:)   We got home about 9pm. Saturday we all went grocery shopping.. probably a huge mistake. It was the day before the 4th and everybody and their brother was at the grocery store. Sunday was the fourth and we went to the fair at Highland's Central Park. We do this every year. The kids love it and they did have such a good time:) Yesterday we didn't do much of anything. Paul went mountain biking and last night we had date night:)   Apparently, Paul has never just gone for a drive. Going no where in particular. Just driving. So that's what we did yesterday. We started out toward St John and then went past there to Cedar Lake then across to Lowell and then up to Merrillville:) We stopped at the Outback in Merrillville and had supper then came home. I think that was one of the nicest dates we've had:) I havent been riding in quite a while and I think he enjoyed it himself:)   Today I've been doing stuff for the garage sale. Paul has been working from home. They launched the Women of Home Depot *big eye roll* today and he's on call to make sure there aren't any serious glitches.   So there is our weekend. It's been a long one, but I'm not ready for it to end just yet. I have been spoiled I guess:).  Hope everyone else had a nice one as well:)  take care

      Ah..so my last post did make it.  I thought it was down when I tried and that I had wasted a good 10 minutes or so of my time.  Last time I mentioned my new iPod..now I am feeling quite guilty about it these days.  I accidently let slip that I had bought the iPod during my trip back from France for the 4th of July with a ladyfriend.  What followed was one of my greatest guilt trips of the year as she went off on me about how there was no good reason for me to buy it and how I didn't listen to anything she told me about how to better manage myself.  It was a lousy end to a great trip that included a private showing of the King Tut artifacts, a very spicy Thai dinner, early morning jogging in France, visits to 3 interesting French towns, and pizzas topped with apples and plums.  Anyways, I managed to mend things with the woman by telling her I would consult her the next time before I made such a purchase and by leaving some gummi bears on her desk at work during her lunch break.  I now realize that I do have some sort of buying addiction of technology-related items.  Those of you who have met me know how many gadgets I have and how I love to always have them about me.  The problem is I have too many of them and am always struggling to keep up with the newest ones out there.  So I gotta figure out some sort of course of action to deal with this problem.  Another interesting problem I have noticed about myself is not being able to come home before 10 pm after work.  I am now doing a break from language classes, but I still for whatever reason can not manage to get home..tonight after a bit of spodding at work, I went to the local pool hall and played a couple of games till 10pm came around..for some reason I just don't like going home......

      Ok, my brain has been completely fried by today.  I work in London and atm I am commuting from home which takes an hour or so by train.  Today I got as far as Marylebone, feeling sick, promptly was, and ended up having a panic attack.  Marvellous.  I have ended up spending £19.80 on a return trip to Marylebone station.  Since this morning I have seen a doctor, realised that I am very scared about this increasingly delayed operation, and slept almost all afternoon.  Not the best day in the world although I have had worse.  On the plus side, a friend is hopefully coming down to visit Saturday so that should be cool. :)  In the post I got two keyrings - a Lego ghost and a Lego vampire which are excellent, very cute and cheered me greatly.  Thanks to Ragdoll :)

      Well, here's what's good in my life, followed by a quick phone company rant!  So where did I leave off last time?  My grandmother is still hanging in there, she'll be 97 next week.  Her pneumonia symptoms are slowly clearing up.  No more cough, but still has laboured breathing.    Since last Wednesday, I've been living on my own, and that will end today when Scott and Sue return from their vacation to Fruitvale and Kelowna.  I've been feeding their cat Kittles for them while they've been gone.  She is the strangest cat I've ever seen.  She's so anti-social, she makes hermits look outgoing and friendly.  Since they left, she's become a recluse, hiding here and there, only coming out to eat and look for Scott.  But in that time, I saw Spiderman 2, possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Totally enjoyed it!  I really enjoyed the performance of Rosemary Harris and Alfred Molina.  They really made the movie for me.  Their characters were very well performed.  James Franco did a good job, NOT!  He played the easiest role of all.  The spoiled rich kid who wants revenge cause someone has wronged him.  Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst did well in their roles, but they didn't change all that much from the first movie, which I loved as well.  Friday night was a night in enjoying the Busch Series race, while Saturday night was the same, except I enjoyed most of a quart of rum and the NASCAR race from Daytona.  Sunday was a day of nothingness.  Lots of sleep, a really good supper and lots of Simpsons.  Yesterday was back to work.  A good day of photoshop-ing some pictures for the library screensaver!  THANKS STEPH!!!  I got lots done and enjoyed a nice quiet shift on the media desk.  As for my ebay winnings, last Friday, the boxed sets of Robotech started to arrive.  Sadly, set #5 arrived on Friday, and as you can guess where this is going, Boxed set #4 arrived last night.  So last night, I cleaned up the little mess I had made in the house, had a nice supper of fish and green beans and while watching some of the Robotech Masters series.  Dana Sterling, Marie Crystal, Bowie, Angelo Dante...just like I remembered them.  WWE RAW was on, then I played around for a bit on my PC, read some more of the new book I started, The Lone Drow and hit the sack.  Now for my rant!  My Mom called last night to say my phone bill from Aliant had arrived.  I was like cool, 5.75 for my email account right?  Nope, 300 and something in miscellaneous charges.  w00t!!! Those rotten dumbasses.  And to make matters worse, if you need help, Aliant's business hours for help are 8am to 6pm.  So if your phone is fucked any time after 6pm, you're screwed without service until the next day.  Isn't that great.  So I called internet support to see if they could tell me if I was billed for the adsl modem I had returned in April.  They couldn't tell me anything.  Just as I figured they couldn't.  So I get to work and call this morning.  37 minutes and 16 seconds of being on hold and I get the billing department.  I explain my problem and ask to know what I was billed for.  The woman's response, oh.  I can't see that information.  That comes from the credit department.  HELLO!  You billed me for this stuff and you can't tell me wtf  you billed me for?  HELLO!  Wake up!  I want service, not to be more pissed off.  So she puts in my complaint to the billing department.  So anyway, I ask how long will that take.  Your complaint will be held up due to the strike.  How long will it take?  Oh, anywhere from a month to two months to resolve this.  Ok.  Well, I'm not paying you anything.  No, you shouldn't.  We've billed so many customers for stuff that is wrong, it's sad right now.  Ok.  Well, cancel every service I have with you, which should only be an email account.  You can tell me I have an email account right?  You are billing me for it.  Yes, sir, you do have an email account and nothing else with us.  Ok.  Cancel it.  What's your email address sir, I can't see what the account name is!  It's drizzt@nbnet.nb.ca.  Oh yes, I see that right here.  This is pathetic.  I'm wavering on sending a complaint to the CRTC about this.  This is the worst service I've received from anyone.  Anyway, I have the slip to prove I returned the modem and they won't give me a number for the department I want to talk to so I can resolve this.  It better be dealt with ASAP, because I hate this crap and like to get it resolved right away.  Telephone companies, they should all be shut down we should all become telepathic.  Anyway, tune in next time, same bat time, same bat channel!

      Well, at least for a little while.  I've been cleaning and packing and reading and running all sorts of errands I didn't have time for.  I'm sure in time I'll get reeeeeally bored.  But until then...  It's hard to believe, I take posession of my house a week from this Friday.  Go me!  I'll have to take my cam and take pictures for everyone to see.    Shit.  There's so much work to do.   I think I'm going to dig up something for lunch.  I'm starved.  I've got a potroast in the crockpot and that's not helping much either, cause it's starting to smell goood.  TTFN.

      OK, so I've finally realised that i have to come to blogger to post, not that I was trying hard, I was in shock from not being able to use my computer in so long. I therefore would like to dedicate this post to Matt! Yup, finally I no longer have to risk Ginge's bed to spod ;)  I am now settling into life in Dorset quite nicely. It took me only 3 weeks to get a job (and I wasn't really trying that hard the first week, as you do). So yey! I start on Monday so am making the most of my last week of freedom...well not really, I'm sat here at the computer as normal but never mind!  I have to do a three day induction course next week which is sounding worryingly like those dodgy 'managerial courses' they send people on to 'bond' and so forth. I need to take with me three items...which is a bit of a bugger as I didn't bring every bit of crap down south with me! 1. A photo of family or friends (lets see which dodgy meet photo should i pick?) 2. a momento of my best ever holiday (i don't have momentoes other than sand in my suitcase) and 3. an object that helps describe your favourite interest outside of work (sex, drink, err?). So I need to get thinking...  Oh and what the hell are penguin videos doing on our blog? Has Russ infiltrated blogger to add his personal collection?

      So I've been slacking in the TCZ posts, I know.  I've blogged elsewhere (*cackle*) but have been too lazy to get this far.  Not to mention that I've actually had to work quite a bit in the last week so I've generally been busy and extremely tired.  Not really much is new in our world.  Adam is combatting the evil pollen that snows around here (STILL) and we've actually spent more time with his family this past weekend then we have in a while (including his grandmother!).  It was actually nice - and I drank lots of red wine so thats reason to be happy on its own.  We got to see Rob/Snarf on Friday which was nice - hopefully he wasn't too wired after having some  Tarte au Sucre  ;)  For a recipe see KathrynAnn's website.  Tonight we are most likely going to see Sue/Sydney & Scott/Weagle as they are also in town.  Last time they were here we played this great boardgame (Cranium) so we'll probably end up doing the same ;)  Nothing major planned for this week - maybe I'll get my butt back into gear and finish up my scrapbooks which have been sitting idling by since I lived in Toronto.  Perhaps I will also do more yardwork - I don't know.  Depends on how many shifts I get this week (so far, only one).  As for how I'm feeling myself - physically, much better.  The pills they gave me seem to have the done trick and I no longer have any sort of abdominal pain.  Hopefully it stays that way and everything returns to normal.  Emotionally, I'm a little bit up and down.  I was pretty down by the end of this weekend due to feeling exhausted from work, etc so that rather sucked.  Hopefully things will improve.  Right now I just feel like I need a vacation somehow (no dear, not an Alaskan cruise - thats next year ;)).  But then again, in the past when I have felt kind of crappy I always took some sort of vacation - whether that was to my dad's in Ottawa or somewhere in Europe or flying transcontinentally - it just sort of happened.  On the brighter side of things - I'm down 3lbs.  Yeah okay not THAT much but its a start and I'm happy with that.  I'm looking to be down 20-30 lbs by CAN3 in Oct so I'm totally getting my butt in gear.  I love having an elliptical trainer at home :)    Anyhoo, must be off...

      Damnit all to hell and back.  As I mentioned in a previous blog, I'd never seen Sex AND the City (thank you Corey for setting me straight on the title). I haven't had HBO in yonks so I never was able to watch it. And I'm not really one to rent DVDs of television shows - well, until out of boredom one day I rented 24 and well, most of you know how that turned out. So when Sex and the City premiered on TBS I decided to see what all the hype was about.  I liked it, laughed with it, but on the whole I found myself troubled by how I couldn't relate to much of it at all. I couldn't find a single thread to attach myself to that would suck me into it. No pun intended. I was regarding it as a light, fluffy fun little show but I wouldn't be devastated if I missed catching it when it aired.  So now it's the 4th of July weekend and my daughter's birthday is over, it's too feckin' hot and humid outside to go do anything and frankly, I live in one of the dullest places on earth anyway so I decide to spend the day seeing the real Sex and the City, The episodes with the swearing and the nudity and all the good stuff they just can't show on network television.  I definitely like the dirty version much better :)  Not that the show is like watching porn or anything. It just seemed a little deeper (again, no pun intended) and less fluffy with all the juicy bits back in. But in my haste to get out of the hectic crowds in the only Blockbuster in town, I grabbed the wrong season. I blame shitty labelling actually. Anyway, I ended up renting the sixth and final season. Or what I thought was the whole season anyway. Luckily SatC seems to be one of those shows where it's ok to jump in anywhere. So I watched episodes 1-12 and I found that there were many threads I could grab onto and enjoy the show - but my favourite thread was seeing Misha again. I had forgotten that Baryshnikov was a part of the final season; I had read about it a while ago and I remember thinking, 'Oh my god Baryshnikov!'  I love that man. I saw him in White Knights when I was a little older than my daughter and ohhh, he just killed me in that. The accent, the body, the glow-in-the-dark-eyes, the beautiful dancing.... *girly sigh* I know White Knights was no Oscar-worthy movie but it will always be on my Top 10 list of favourite films just for the interaction between Misha and the legend Gregory Hines (R.I.P.).  I won't gush anymore about Misha, who despite Corey's determined declarations that he is not aging well, looked just as beautiful to me now as he did back then when he showed up in episode 12. Man oh man. So when I finished that disc I was all fired up to rent the final episodes and see more of him. Yes I know how the show ends and stuff but I wanted to look at him some more :)  Unfortunately the fecking final episodes haven't been released on DVD yet. I'm so crushed. And I can't for the life of me find out anywhere online when they will be released which is even more disappointing.  This post is in danger of reaching Fire lengths if I carry on about it, but I've decided maybe I should actually start watching the show from the beginning and kill time before they release Misha for me. So if you'll excuse me, I saw a cute pair of Manolo's and they are calling my name.

      Oh joy! Rapture!  Today, at 4:35am I stepped off the bus and back into vancouver. My trip back home to Trail was a short one, but it was well worth the trip. I got to see my family, a couple of my friends (including Fire and Trinity!) and even get in a little sun. I left tuesday afternoon for Trail and was planning on staying two weeks. However, those plans got muddled up when I received an employment opportunity (which starts tomorrow) last thursday. This guy wants to to help him fix up his 7 bedroom house - he says it should be for the rest of the summer. The guy is selling the house in september so he wants a good worker to do some grunt work for him. He chose the right guy!  Today I've gone shopping and am getting things ready for my job tomorrow. I bought a water container, a hat to keep the sun off my head, and new shoe laces for my work boots. whoohoo. I'm already to go! Tonight I think I might even take my woman out to see Spiderman 2. I hear it's pretty good! I can't wait to see it.  It is now 2:15pm and I am about to make some cookies! I might also surprise my woman with dinner when she gets off of work. I hope I don't burn the place down - but just incase, I've put the fire department on speed dial (which really wasn't worth the effort, as all I'd have to dial is 911 :P) Wish me luck!

      Finally, finally I have managed to get myself on the Blog.  Due to various hitches a) my lack of proficiency with anything remotely technical and b) the fact that I have a distinct feeling that Blogger doesn't like me anyway as it killed my last account...  I am here!  Unfortunately I don't actually have much to say, other than hullo again folks :)

      Heidi ho, neighborinos.  I've been reading someone elses blog (Completely and utterly unrelated to TCZ) for awhile now. I had accidently stumbled across it while hard at work and I found the circumstances he was undertaking quite interesting, if only from a "God I would NEVER do that" perspective. The quick summary is: He met this girl online through LiveJournal (He lives in Las Vegas, she lived in Wisconsin), they fell in love over the phone, and now she was going to move in with him and they were going to live happily ever after. Well, my Adam-sense went off and I lurked both his and her journals for about two months (The whole courtship -> moving thing took about a month and a half) and oddly enough, they both stopped posting for about 3 weeks after "THE BIG MOVE".  One day, I'm reading the  DearAsshole Livejournal community   and there's a post from her being completely and utterly BITCHY. Now I have to say, I didn't much like her from the beginning. Her profile was a big ball of bullshit wrapped in horsepucky. She had an IQ of 172, she was an attorney at 17, she was lead editor of major newspapers at 16, blah blah blah; altogether, she was the queen bee on a honeypot of vinegar (Oooh, mixed metaphor).    Her post, in this big journal (Which she KNEW he read) is as follows:    Okay, let's talk about consideration......  Dear Asshole:  I moved across the country to be with you. You said you loved me. You said a lot of things.  I understand you don't have tons of relationship experience. I understand you've never lived with a girl before. And that is okay. I understand that means you'll have to learn some things about being in a relationship. And that is okay, too.  Let's talk about what isn't okay.  I don't care how little relationship experience you have, there are certain things that are about common courtesy and human decency.  Let's say your girlfriend comes home after a 12 hour long shift at her brand-new, stressful job. And this girlfriend needs to wind down, so she goes to watch a baseball game on TV - quietly, because she knows you're napping in the next room. And let's say half an hour later you wake up. And you go out to the living room and you see her sleeping, dozed off in front of the game. What do you do, what do you do?  Here's what a reasonable human being would do: a reasonable human being would either put a blanket on her and turn off the tv, or possibly wake her up so she could go to the bed and be more comfortable.  But here's what YOU did instead, by way of contrast. You came to the living room, turned the TV to a different channel, and raised the volume, waking said girlfriend up - in spite of the fact that there was a TV in the bedroom you could've watched if you needed to see The Simpsons that badly.  But the girlfriend was understanding and just went to the bedroom to sleep some more.  What would a reasonable human being do at this point? It's pretty easy - they'd be quiet while she napped, or keep things at a generally reasonable noise level.  What did you do? You decided to do dishes. To run the garbage disposal. And to play music loudly enough that you could hear it over the garbage disposal.  No reasonable man would expect to be able to do this and still have his testicles attached at the end of the day.  But your girlfriend was so nice that she didn't even mind this so much - maybe, she thought, the music wasn't as loud as she perceived it. So she put in earplugs to block it out and finally sleep.  She realized when she did, that not only could she hear every lyric of the song playing, she could feel the bass line in the floor.  This made her upset, incredibly upset actually. She'd had a hard day at work and was exhausted, and now she couldn't sleep - and what the hell kind of person would do that, anyway?   The more she thought about it, the madder she got. And while she usually is the first to say when something is wrong, she decided she shouldn't have to tell ANYONE not to blast loud music while someone is napping in the next room, regardless of their lack of relationship experience.  So when she finally does tell you, is it your fault for being an asshole, or is it her fault for failing to ask you nicely to turn down the 80 dB music you felt was fine to play while someone was napping?  Reasonable person survey says: the first one.  You said the second. You said you didn't know the music was that loud. When I insisted you must have, you said you didn't think I could hear it through the bedroom door - in spite of the fact that you've turned down the living room TV as you were going to bed before so it wouldn't bother you. Then you used the usual "I'm new at this and if I make mistakes it's just because I've never been told." Never been told? THREE YEAR OLDS know not to disturb people with noise as they sleep. Then you resorted to calling me a hypocrite because I ask you to bring me relationship troubles when they happen - you know what? Doing that isn't a relationship problem. It's a problem with being a human being and existing in society. No one does that shit.  So when we fought, I ended up saying you were totally inconsiderate, to which you replied "but I'm not TRYING to be," as if that made it okay. Let me tell you something: no one tries to be inconsiderate. You have to try to be considerate. Well, ok, so I told you, and you agreed to be more considerate.  We also agreed I wouldn't go up this weekend to meet your family, but you'd still go on the trip - leaving me alone at the apartment over the long weekend (some alone time I desperately needed). And you asked me if I'd get the oil changed in your car today so you wouldn't have to skip lunch and do that instead on your lunch break. Fine, I don't mind doing you a favor, even after all that crap. I got the oil change, which came to $32. You gave me $40.  When you got home, you asked me for the keys and your change. Because of money things, that change was the only money I had to spend all weekend. And now it was gone, and you didn't even think about it. And you didn't even thank me for getting it done for you.  And then you left. I went to grab a soda from the fridge - and then realized you'd taken all of it and there was nothing left to drink in the entire house.  Fine, I decided to brew some iced tea - I'd just filled the ice cube trays the night before, so I brewed the tea, poured it into the pitcher, and then looked in the freezer - you had emptied the ice cube trays and put them back in the freezer absolutely empty. I was holding cold, hollow plastic with not a single cube of ice.  These are not the actions of a person who's just inexperienced at relationships. They are the actions of someone absolutely inexperienced with life. You are the most socially retarded person I have ever had the misfortune to meet. I have known autistic kids who know that loud noise wakes people up. I have known developmentally disabled children who know better than to leave empty ice cube trays in the freezer.  What's your excuse, asshole? Sincerely,  me   So, the guy is a big dweeb. Some of her complaints are relatively legitamite, some are just what you naturally go through in the first couple months of a relationship, some are just weird. She's venting, so let her vent. Anyways, not a day later, comes his response....awesome :)    His post:    Dear me:  So you want to talk about “reasonableness” and “consideration.”  Well I don’t know whether I should start from the beginning, or from now and work my way back. Either way there is no conceivable way in which I could possibly cover all of the examples of how you’ve done oh so well at exhibiting the highest standards of both. [/sarcasm]  Since my mind has a tendency to go all over the place, I suppose I’ll just let it out as it comes out. I suppose the 12 hour work day would be a start. Actually, I suppose we could go into what a rough week of work you had…..wait a second, a week?!?!? I would LOVE it if I could have gotten away with working less than two weeks in the previous two months. But no, that’s not an option I’ve had. You see, while you were busy sitting at home talking to your friends and playing on the Internet all day, I was busy working EVERY day because quite frankly if I didn’t, I’d be writing this from a cardboard box right about now.  You moved out here by giving me the understanding that you’d save up enough money to support yourself for a couple of weeks while you got settled in.   And I realize we got off to a rough start. After your mother went to the trouble of warning me about the shittiness of your car I asked you if you were sure that it would be okay to make it across the country (especially through the Colorado Rockies in snow season). You assured me that it would be fine and not to worry. I trusted you, obviously that was my first mistake. Because obviously a “reasonable” person would believe that a 10-year old Cadillac with nearly 200,000 miles on it and a host of problems can be trusted to make it 2,000ish miles in 2 days.  After said car died on us in Denver I rented a car with the assurance that your parent’s oh so wonderful AAA Gold membership would take care of it. Well, what choice did I have? We needed to get home right? So even as I dreaded that, and the fact that it meant we’d have to drive back the next weekend, and drive 24 hours in two days, I really didn’t have a problem with it. I loved you and I was willing to do whatever I had to in order to make things work.  Later when we realized that we wouldn’t have the money to pay for the repairs (after I’d already obtained a pay day loan to cover the charges for the rental car that I thought I’d be recovering at some point in time) I did something I haven’t done in years. I asked my father for money. Due to his generosity, inspired by a desire to help us start out on the right track, he obliged. But much like other fiscal matters in the months to come you didn’t show me the slightest bit of gratitude for what I had done. Even after I told you how hard it was for me to ask him for money you couldn’t even acknowledge that and thank me for doing it, for you, for us.  I was relieved when you told me the repairs would be far less than we thought they would be. I didn’t think the car was worth keeping for the greater amount. So you can imagine my shock (or at least a reasonable person would) when you paid the bill and it ended up being nearly twice what I’d planned for. Oh well, what was done was done. Again, no thanks, no acknowledgement.  But enough about that damn car, even if after we went to all that trouble to bring it back here it died less than a week later. And even if as of YESTERDAY I was asking you to help me move it so that it wouldn’t be towed you said “I don’t want to do it now, we’ll do it when you get back.”  That’s always your response, “I’ll do it later.” That seems to have been your attitude for everything from making an appointment with a temp. service, to giving them the information they need when you finally do work. Last Saturday I had to get yet another pay day loan (both of these the first time I’ve done so in well after a year, and previously it was because of dealing with my dead car) because you couldn’t be bothered to go to the temp service at a convenient time. When I came home sick from work on Thursday I asked you if you could take care of it that day, since obviously I wouldn’t be needing my functioning car for anything for the rest of the day. “I’ll take you to work tomorrow, and do it then” you said. This was BEFORE you knew that you had a phone interview at 2:00 that day. After that I was fine with it (although you could’ve still done both). But no, you couldn’t even stop to consider for a second that doing it that day would’ve been a helluva lot more considerate of the fact that doing without my car (especially unnecessarily) is a huge hassle to me. So anyway, as a result, it didn’t get done in time and I was left borrowing money so I could silly little things like put drinks in the fridge.  Oh yes, the drinks in the fridge. I love your renewed attitude of guilty until proven innocent. So I guess I’ll jump ahead a bit and move on to yesterday. I gave you $40 for the oil change, because I figured that would cost about $20, and it might need a new air filter, so then $20 wouldn’t cut it. According to the receipt in my car it came to just under $20. You gave me $8 and some change and told me you’d purchased a few other things. I hadn’t planned for that, but oh well. I figured you wouldn’t buy anything you didn’t really need right?  Of course a conversation about this probably would’ve been much easier to have if you hadn’t been on the phone the whole time. Silly me. If I say I love someone and they’re going away for three days I think I could get off the phone long enough to give a proper goodbye to that person and work out any necessary details.   Oh yeah, so speaking of that paycheck that you couldn’t be bothered to take care of last week. Well you managed to receive that check this week. Over $200, well over the change I took back from you so that I could eat on my way up here. When I got in the car I noticed your wallet with your ID was in there. I knew you couldn’t cash your check without that or a car, so I made a trip upstairs to make sure you had both (your ID, my brother’s car). You’d asked me the day before where the check cashing place was, so I had stupidly assumed that since you had the means to cash your check, you would so. This seemed especially reasonable as you had given me NO indication that you needed any other money. Had you said ANYTHING I would’ve had no problem taking out more than $40 and having you keep what you needed to get by. I’m still baffled as to why you claim to be broke this weekend based somehow, on my actions.  As for the drinks issue. Wow, here’s where your lovely tendency to assume the worst in me really comes to shine. When I went to hit the road I saw there were two sodas left. I grabbed one figuring you’d have the last one and that would tide you over until you could get off your ass long enough to get money and to the store. Obviously I was wrong, but this is proving not to be a first for me. It wasn’t until I’d gotten on the road that I saw John drinking one that I figured out he’d grabbed the last one. By then it was too late, but I figured you’d manage. Afterall, would it really be THAT wrong of me if I had intentionally the last in a pack of soda that I’d paid for?!?!?  So you went to get some ice, and apparently it wasn’t there. Again you assume it was somehow my nefarious motives that precluded those ice trays from having ice in them. Sorry, that’s not the case. Upon some investigation John tells me that Robby used them on Sunday night and may have not refilled them. I haven’t touched them in weeks, but thanks for assuming that if I did I wouldn’t refill them. Before you came along if it weren’t for me they never would have been filled.  But the dishes, oh yes, my washing of the dishes, the most egregious sin of all. But geez, did anyone reading this stop and ask WHY a guy with no relationship or living with a partner experience would have cause to do dishes? Anyone who knew me or my lifestyle would know that doing dishes used to be rare event for me. Why? Because I live like a bachelor. I don’t cook, I don’t mess up my dishes, and when I do I rinse them off.   So the reason I was doing dishes is quite simple. I was cleaning up after you. The problem is to say that is a gross (and I do mean that literally) understatement is putting it incredibly lightly. I really fail to see how someone that leaves half consumed food on the stove (and that’s assuming they turn the stove or oven off when they’re done with it) and unrinsed dishes anywhere has ANY room to speak about lack of consideration. The fact that Robby got so frustrated with it after your first week here that he cleaned it himself and that you still didn’t figure out that it was a problem boggles my mind.  So why did I have to do it that night of all nights? Well up until then I thought we were going out of town together to enjoy a nice weekend together with the relaxation we both deserved. I looked forward to showing you around the place I grew up and sharing the things around here that hold significance to me. I wanted to share everything with you. But even after I thought we’d made up you didn’t want to go because you’d “rather sleep.”  I can’t help but be more than a little blown away by that after you complain about my sleep habits. And ahh yes, sleep. How dare I create noise while you try to sleep? Even after I told you repeatedly that your incessant clacking of the keys and the glare of the monitor prevents me from falling asleep you keep doing it. You told me to just tell you if it was bothering me and you’d come to bed. It would be just that easy! And yet every time I tried this it took you AT LEAST an hour to do so, and that was during the times you didn’t yell at me for expecting someone that has to work EARLIER than I do to come to bed before 1:00 am. No, all you could do was stay up all night further validating my theory that you’d rather talk to or associate with anyone who is not me.  I’m sorry, did I say you were on the computer to much? Sorry, you were on MY computer too much. That’s right, yours has been down the majority of your time here and even though it would only cost a few bucks to fix (per your claim) you make no effort to do so. And why should you? You’re on mine if you’re a) awake b) not on the phone running up my long distance charges when you haven’t paid for any of the other expenses you’re using since your first week here and c) not busy making a mess in the kitchen. And then I’m made to feel guilty if I spend five minutes on it. Remember when I’d been using it, was in the middle of the game and I got up to use the bathroom and you were on it for the next hour? Yeah, real fucking considerate.   But you know what? I could get past a lot of this stuff if I thought it was worth it. But I don’t know if I can get over the passive-aggressive manner in which you’ve chosen to address this. I mean really, a post in a LiveJournal community that you had to know full well that I was a member of? (If you didn’t, all you had to do was check my user info page, and I highly doubt you were unaware).  Heaven forbid that you talk to me about this. Heaven forbid that you call me (my cell phone is rarely more than two feet away from me, but that would require you not being 	on the phone already I suppose….). You couldn’t even be bothered to validate ANY of the horrible things you’d assumed about me. This continual pattern of assuming the worst of intentions in me has to stop if we’re going to have ANY hope of working this shit out.  Your inconsideration runs far too deep. As misguided and stupid as I may have been, my motives that ended up upsetting you that night were based in consideration (if I clean this stuff up tonight neither one of us will have to come home from a long drive to a smelly and gross kitchen). You on the other hand, are just innately inconsiderate. You may be incredibly intelligent for your age, but you have a LOT of growing up to do. And if you can't acknowldge any of your role in this, then I really don't know what you're still doing in my home.    And my jaw just hits the floor. Best Online Fight Ever. Point, CounterPoint, a drag down punch out KILLFEST of incredible proportions. I just found it so fascinating to have this veil of 'perfection' ripped away to see what a person is really like, and there we have it. I had to contact this guy so I mailed him and said "OMG u R S LEET!" or something to that effect.  Moving on to this week, he leaves the coup de grace, PICTURES! And my friends, nothing says "I love you" more then   finding out just how much of a sham a person is  . I swear, by my puppies grave, I will follow this beeyatch around the Internet making sure that no one gets suckered in as much as this poor guy did.

      Ok..its been ages since I last posted..or so its seems.  It does appear that I had the honor of the last post using the old system :).  Its good to see so many other people blogging.  A year ago this time, I think 90% were made by myself, Madness and Star.    I'm watching the Greece-Czech semifinals in the Eurocup.  I have actually found the Eurocup football more interesting than the World Cup even without no American team. I am beginning to think that the final, which ironicaly, will be on July 4th, will be the closest thing Europe has to a superbowl.  For the 4th, it appears that I will be spending it in France.  Oh well, like Switzerland or Liechtenstein make any more sense.  I just got a new IPod today.  This is my 5th MP3 player in 4 years.  Although it looks the classiest, I am somewhat disppointed in that it does not allow you to delete files directly from the Ipod (have to use iTunes) and that it appears to want to connect to only the first computer you initialize with.  This sucks as I was hoping to use it to swap music around various computers.  We will see..I have already read about ways around this.  Ok..Melia..there you go. I am back :)  Happy? ;)

      I hate when I accidentally post to the wrong blog like I just did to this one :)  But I've fixed that now.  Hey, I got a B10 postcard from Dr Coffin! Thanks, Charlie!  Anyone know what the huck is up with TCZ?  P.S. I am available to do evil things to Camerak this weekend if someone wants ;)  You know where to find me!  And if you don't, sad news :P  P.P.S I am post 100! WOO HOO! Go me! *does the post #100 dance*

      Ever since I moved to New Mexico to start the first grade, August has always marked a terrifying time of the year for me...namely going back to classes.  Even many years and a Ph.D. later, across the Atlantic, and to a different culture, I still find myself in that ever-terrifying first week at school.  Back at the age of 6 or 7 it was worries about if I would have to sit next to the class bully, could I get the paper book jackets on my text book straight, and would I spend all of my lunch money on football pencils.  Now, its more worries if I will understand the teacher in German or Italian, will I have to sit next to that obnoxious woman from the Czech republic, and who will I be paired with to complete the next assignment.  Thus today, I started 2 classes..well both were followups to previous classes - Tennis and German.  Tennis of course is really just a fun class - I should practice for homework, but usually do not.  I did notice 2 new women - but the darn instructor seperated all the men from the women..so I gotta figure out how to sneak onto the women's court next time ;)  Then it was off to my German class.  This one is an advanced class that is really like going to a high school English class -but in German - complete with reading novels and having to write essays discussing characters and their motives.  Only one other man in my German class - a Chinese- otherwise its dominated by Eastern European Women who delight in correcting me.  I forgot to bring my book with me, thus I had to share a book with one of them today.   Tomorrow the classes continue again with Italian..Oh boy..I hope I remember how to understand that language ;)

      People like to say that the truth is stranger than fiction.  Boy, if you know my family, you know they aren't kidding.  I shoot the... er... crap with my sister rather frequently, because we're both on MSN messanger.  So I see her... usually once a week or so.  And every time I catch up on the gossip, there's always something new to report.    My sister was the third child in our family.  So I wonder if it's just an extreme case of the Pay Attention To Meeeee's or just some sort of bizzare, unidentified personality disorder. :)  The former, you would have think would have worn off by now... she's in her early 20s.  The teenage angst should be over with.   Anyhow, this all began when my sister decided she wanted to be an adult entertainer.  Since she's... um... extremely overendowed, and she says she wasn't into any of the darker aspects of the trade, supposedly this consisted mostly of dressing up as a cheerleader and jumping up and down.  Pretty harmless stuff I guess, and it pays the bills for a while.  Not too bad, I suppose, but not something you expect to be doing for very long.  Well, it's true it didn't last for very long, because she's got an attention span for careers that lasts about 3 days.  :)  Sandra decided to go into business with a friend doing "erotic" massage as a masseusse by the name of Satin Touch.  Again, this was supposedly fairly innocent as far as the sex trades go, and went sour when Sandra's friend decided she wanted to add some female escort stuff on the side.  So she was out on her own again.  I think the whole family was expecting her to grow out of the phase and go back to real work.  But that would have been too normal for Sandra :)  Sandra decided she didn't like getting naked for people, so instead she moved sideways in the trade.  She decided to move into the realm of S&M.  Translation: she decided to try her hand at beating the crap out of men (and the occasional woman) for a living.  Now, granted, this sounds like every woman's dream job, especially when she's on the rebound :)  But rarely do people actually make the career choice ;)  She went all out, black leather and whips and stuff.  And she started joining the cast of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I'm having difficulty confirming what started first, her penchant for dressing as a man dressed as a woman in scary dominatrix outfits, or her work as a dominatrix.  I have a suspicion that the two are linked somehow :D    Speaking of which, here's a picture of her as Frank:  urlLink      urlLink http://denverrhps.com/ is also the site for the whole Denver RHPS scene.  Just for you, Steph :)  Near neighbors, geographically speaking.  Anyhoo, I thought this was about as bizzare as it could possibly get when Sandra recently announced another career change.  Sandra, possibly still suffering some post-traumatic teenage angst syndrome, had decided to run away and join the circus.  Well, I suppose it wasn't really running away, as they seem to be some sort of local group.  But yes, my dear sister has become, by her own volition, a carnival freak.  To be more precise, she decided to start a strong-man act where she lifts heavy objects with her boobs.  Like telephone books.  And somehow I had more difficulty convincing people that she had actually decided to do this than I did getting people to believe she was a dominatrix.  Go figure.  But now, ladies and gentleman, I have photographic evidence!  The naughty bits are not visible so I hope Steph doesn't get mad at me for this.  But really this was too priceless not to share.    I present to you: The Amazing Boobzilla!  urlLink     And yes, that really IS her carny name.  To boot, today I discover that she's decided to shack up with a fire-eater who goes by the unimaginitive name of "Crispy."  She says this whole group is his gig.  I guess he finds the idea of her lifting telephone books with her tits is really seductive or something.    Oddly enough, not too long ago (actually I think it was last week's news), for some reason my sister decided also to become an ordained minister.  I have no idea why.   But you know what?  Getting yourself married by the Amazing Boobzilla would definitely rate as an incredible thing.  I think it must actually edge out getting married by Elvis.  And you could hire on Crispy to spew some flaming vodka instead of doing that boring traditional crap like blowing bubbles or throwing rice.  I wonder if she performs the vow ceremony with telephone books under each tit.  That'd definitely present you with some unorthodox wedding photos. :D    Takers?  Anyone?

      "I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! Oooh, Lions! Rrrroooooooooooaaaaaarrrrrr! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! "  No I've not gone mad, this was the the child's side of a conversation with his mother in London Zoo yesterday . I guess, like Russ, he too was particularly taken with penguins, so much so that even a lion couldn't stem his demands. So, as I'm sure you've guessed, I was at London Zoo yesterday along with Star and Millymollymandy. As my pre-birthday treat, I was allowed to choose where we went for the day, so we all stumped up 13 quid (EEP!) to get in and wander round the zoo for 4-5 hours. As zoo's go it was ok, although I thought there would be a lot more animals there. The giraffes as always were impressive and I got to see plenty of monkeys including the little redheaded baby Francois langur that prompted "Ginger Sunday" last weekend - where over 1000 redheads got 2 for 1 entry to the zoo!  The meercats were cute and I still can't get over how small they are. Millymollymandy insisted on calling them all "Phil" after the TCZ character who did a meercat impression in one of the Bristol meet videos - and so when she called "Phil" at the meercat enclosure she was quite happy when one of them actually looked over. The penguins were cool (literally!) and unlike the child I now have a penguin (in the form of a money box and a new keyring to replace my rather delapidated lego-man keyring). I was very tempted to go up to the child when we saw him later and say "I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin!"....but I couldn't be that evil, could I?  ;)  Next stop on the London sightseeing is a "flight" on the London Eye with Monster on Friday :)  I can't wait!!

      It was hot and sunny and...obviously perfect weather for us to go to the zoo.  It was officially a (pre)birthday treat for Madness.   Millymollymandy and I secretly harboured hopes of taking Madness and getting either a refund or maybe swapping her for a meerkat or penguin.  Unfortunately they wouldn't let us.  Mean lot.    This week I may be on and off TCZ more than usual - my mum is having an operation (she has breast cancer) and so I don't know quite what will be going on.  Also, my brother will be home and he may be using my NTL connection.  I wish him joy as I thought Freeserve was bad.  NTL is driving me homicidal.  Maybe he'll be able to sort it.  I hope so anyway.   My op has been put back to September so its yet another waiting game.  As the (fabulous) Dorothy Parker says:  Life is a glorious cycle of song A medley of extemporanea And love is a thing that can never go wrong And I am Marie of Roumania  See you the next side of all this.

       urlLink    This was an Auto Zone store.   urlLink     As I sort through the photos here's one from Port Charlotte. This was an Auto Zone parts store, a rather large one (the photo really doesn't do the place justice) and it was completely destroyed. The roof was upheaved and all the shelves collapsed.

       I've just been sitting watching the start of the Olympic Games.  Who on earth chose Bjork to sing after the fireworks?  She has a nice voice but the song's theme seemed to be sweat.  Admittedly the athletes will probably do so (if not there is obviously something wrong with them) but to have a song celebrating this?  Er...ok.      The variations in costume were quite startling - the beautiful national costumes of some countries contrasting with the air host/ess outfits of other countries..and the not quite so attractive tracksuits of several others.         I'd not really thought about the amount of people in the Olympic teams - but the three contestants in the Lichtenstein team looked slightly outnumbered compared to the hordes of the New Zealand team.  Hopefully they won't be outclassed.      Watching the Olympics makes me remember quite how useless  am at games.  I am prepared to admire the feats of others, as long as nobody expects me to be able to do any of it myself :)

       urlLink    Anyone got an umbrella?  urlLink     Okay, the red sploch is where I'm at. Right around Fort Myers, near the beach. We were guessing on a contact point and it looks like we guessed right. It's raining pretty moderately and the winds are getting up there. The hotel location is prime, the network is up, the landlines are sturdy and there's a pretty damn good lunch spread downstairs.  We're all in good spirits, after all we love this stuff.  Hopefully once Scott starts snapping photos and I start sending them to the office systems, I'll share some with you.

      A special blog to fill a special request.  I'm going to be away from my home for a couple of days, taking a road trip to around Sanibel Island to track  urlLink Hurricane Charley . I'll answer all potential questions in a Q &amp; A.   Q: Why are you going?   A: I'm part of the New York Times Regional Newspaper Group emergency team along the Gulf Coast. If there's a decent Hurricane or equivalent catastrophe, I'm there with fellow team members Diane (reporter) and Scott (photographer). I am the third wheel due to my knowledge of the network system.   Q: What's your job?   A: I'm there to make sure the wireless connections will be supported. I call around to hotels on the Island to see which have the capabilities of keeping our network afloat. Then I book three rooms (one for Diane, one for Scott and I and one for the computers, etc.) and find an electrician that can wire the place if it isn't wired. From there I'm strictly a watchdog. I keep charges in the laptops, communications with the editors at the desk, give them weather updates, check the network, check the net to track the storm and transmit the stories from our location to the group.   Q: What happens if something goes wrong?   A: The only three things that can go wrong are: flooding and pipes busting can take away my plan B (landlines); the hotel collapses (I'll die) and the power goes out (thus I lose my wireless capabilities and we're forced to run our laptops on battery and use the landlines. If the landlines are floodieed we'll have to send from a pay phone, which use old ,old lines that can even stand up in the most violent flooding.   Q: How bad is this Hurricane?   A: Looks like an ambitious Cat 2, which means the winds will hit around 90-100 MPH. That's pretty nice but nowhere near as bad as Hurricanes like  urlLink Gilbert  in 1989 and of course  urlLink Andrew  in 1992, Gilbert was a Cat 4 when it made American landfall and Andrew was a moderate Cat 5. This Hurricane isn't close to that.   Q: Are you scared?   A: Not really, I'm more excited than anything else. I'll be fine.   Q: When kind of supplies do you bring for this sort of trip?   A: Well I use the basic Hurricane emergency guidelines. I should be back tomorrow evening or Saturday morning but I'm still packing for four days in case the roads need a day to be cleared or something. I have about 12 gallons of water, lots of canned foods, first-aid kits, towels, etc. Nothing out of the ordinary for an emergency kit.   Q: If I see you tonight on TCZ what do I do?   A: Say hi. I'm stuck in a room chilled to the bone (for the computers) while Diane and Scott are probably in the hotel lobby drinking and whooping it up with the Weather Channel people. I have a high speed and hotel cable so chances are I'm bored to tears.   Q: Who watches your dogs?   A: I'm pysched I have a new housesitter since my old one got pregnant and married on me. Hopefully the house will be in one piece when I get back and it seems like my dogs love the sitter so that's the least of my worries. If that falls through, I'll take them with me.  I'll have more exciting details later. If I'm on and can give a blow by blow of the Hurricane as it hits, that'll be even better.  Peace!

       My teeth are awful.   I freely admit this - as it is fairly obvious when I smile. The glint from my two gold crowns can be dazzling. Not. I only have four (maybe 5) front teeth that aren't filled (yet). Give it time.       I went to the dentist Monday afternoon as I may have mentioned in the previous blog. Every one of the 6 month appointments I have ever had has led to more fillings, root canals, apisectomies... let's face it, my teeth are not known for their robust qualities. In fact the dentist has said (more than once) that my fillings are stronger than my teeth. Marvellous.       This time I only had to have one tiny filling in a tooth with no nerve. Fantastic. I was extremely pleased (sad, I know). Unfortunately today I had a phonecall from my dentist saying that actually the X-rays showed another filling that needed doing.       Maybe dentures are the way to go? Knowing my luck (which seems to be bad verging on awful atm) I would have badly fitting false teeth that would give me ulcers. Maybe I'll keep my own teeth. Assuming that they let me.

       OK.  Up until Monday morning, I was going in for an operation today.  Unfortunately while I was sitting in Matt's living room I got the phone call postponing my op.  I now go in sometime in September.  Kind of put a dampener on the last bit of the meet for me (I went home soon after).        It isn't that I particularly want to have a craniotomy.  It is more that I just want to get this all over and done with so that I can get back to a reasonably normal life (or what passes for one around here).        Bomo - it was good, a worthy end to a decade of meets :)  We have all grown up so much - after all, we are now old enough to play bingo and not snigger (too much).  Get the Nora Batty stockings and the zimmer frames out.        Anyway, I had a fantastic time - I've been on the dodgems, been to Poole quay, been bingo-ing (as above), been to the beach, been clubbing (and let's face it, I haven't been dancing for a hell of a long time and boy had I missed it)...I basically did everything in one weekend (and have been sleeping nonstop since!)      Thanks to Matt for an excellent end to the Bomo decade :)

      Its now a little after 2am on Sunday night, and things are starting to quiet a bit at B10.  Some conversation is going on about rides scratched at Alton Towers, but for this blog it is more important to reflect upon the events of the last 2 B10!  When I last left off, we were off to the beach.  Upon arriving, we broke up into a couple of groups.  Some headed straight for the sand, while another group of us decided to see some fish up close and personal at the aquarium.  We got to see shark feeding time from a submerged transparent walkway in a rather large tank full of sharks, stingrays, and giant turtles.  After boing up on our natural sciences, the others I was with decided to do bumper cars, but I decided to take the rare opportunity to allow this land-locked resident of Switzerland with no closeby beach to walk along the Bournemouth coast and take in the the local scenery and beach babes!!!  We then all met up and took the train back, linking up with another group of spods who had chosen to forsake the beach wonders for the safer realms of a local pub.  It was time then to prepare for the big night out at Jazz Juice!  We first went to a couple of watering spots in Bournemouth to soak up some liquor and then made our way back to near the beach and into the nightclub.  JazzJuice was basically a 70s retro night.  We danced or sat on the edge of the dancefloor until about 2.00 am.  Then we grabbed taxis and headed back to consume a midnight snack before hitting the sack.  We also got to observe why it was not a good idea for a taxi company to ever dissapoint our meet host ...  After the spods finally awoke on Sunday morning, we went to a local establishment for some traditional English breakfasts.  The Sunday afternoon event was either bingo or the water park, depending on one's tastes.  Your blogger personally chose the waterpark choice, and despite the long ques, he was not disappointed with the miriad of slides and tube rides ...  It was then dinner at KFC (a treat for me as there are none in Switzerland) and then bowling, followed by some goes at the Dance Dance video game machine.  Then back to Matt's for another renedition of "Fire Wire."  Its now 2.30 am and time for some sleep!

      So here I am, bloggin live from B10!  Its only my second day ever in England, but luckily the learning curve is not as steep as worried about :)  The fun all started on Friday, when I awoke at 3am after only 4 hours of sleep to drive to Zurich, where I would meet Reethi and Sunshine and catch a flight to merry olde England.  The day started out with lousy weather. Most of my driving was through rain and I could only hope that my decision to have brought only warm weather clothing would not be a horrible mistake. About 5.30 am, I arrived at the Zurich airport, parked the car, found the check in termal, changed some francs to pounds and waited for my two travel companions to show up. Luckily, they were not too late.  Sunshine looked the same as ever, but Reethi came with a new hairstyle, now without the blue..  The plane ride to London was for the most part uneventful..we nodded off a bit, but I awoke to discover us in a circling delay to land in London Heathrow.  Although we were delayed a bit, I enjoyed the circling pattern as I got to take in some of the sights of London from the air.  I even recogniyed the snaking bit of the Thames that one sees at the start of every Eastender episode!  Eventually, we landed, and we took the next leg of our trip southward starting with the Underground Tube.  Thus, I also got to see London from below ground - although I admit there was not much to see except a lot of people packed like Sardines reading their morning papers which either talked about the English football coach being cleared of his latest problems, or the more amazing revelation that one of the Big Brother candidates was actually a man earlier in life, but female now.  The headline read, "Father of Big Brother candidate - I always wanted a daughter!!!"  When we reached Picadilly circus, it was time to change from the Tube to the Train. Now, as a faithful follower of the Chevy Chase Vacation movies, I remembered Picadilly Circus as this huge roundabout, which Americans seemed doomed forever to drive around in circles in.  I looked forward to seeing it and Big Ben, but alas all we had time to do after getting our tickets was to get a Burger King Breakfast to go.  We took our seats and we were finally southward bound to Bomo!  A few naps later and a few scares from some clouds, we arrived close to the MudMeet Mecca.  As we stopped in Christchurch, we noticed Ginge, Zebedee, and Trax walk bz. Christoph banged on the window, but Ginge in his dark glasses could not see us frantically waving at him.  The train went off to its next stop, where Sunshine and Reethi departed to check into their hotel and I went on to Pool and finally got the other spodders attention in their car though a text message.  Finally, Parkstone came!  It was a much smaller trainstation than I had expected.  But probably it was good as it was small as Matt's place was literally right next to it.  There I quickly found old faces such as Lorena Huxley, while meeting new spods in person for the first time, although it could feel quite strange, having spent hundreds of virtual hours with them.  People were just finishing breakfast despite it being more like 1pm.  We broke up into a couple of groups - one consisting mainly of women for shopping - and the rest at the pub next door.  I opted for the latter option and found myself quickly going through beer after beer - and then cider (not the American apple juice type) - and quickly worked up a buzz as spod after spod appeared.  I found the people quite easy to chat up and met a few non spodders, including a woman from the English Birmingham, which I found interesting, as my last job in America was in the other Birmingham (Alabama).  Finally, it was time to move on to the event of the evening - B2.  This was a small, but nice pub with a single pool table - which seemed like something for children as it was smaller than the standard Americna pool table.  The B9 tournament was finally finished, with Dafty beating out host Matt.  Games of Twister were to be had, but I never managed to get past 3rd place, despite my trainings in yoga.  Although most were wide awake, my early morning start was starting to get to me, combined with the heavy fish and chips I had for dinner.  I had to take a walk outside to clear my head. About midnight, we headed back to Matt's and listened to his heavy beats, including the favorite, "Fire Wire."  I was dead tired and managed to actually get some sleep despite the loud music.  Everyone crashed around 3am.  Saturday morning started with me being the lucky second for a shower, giving me plenty of time to enjoy a "Vegetarian Breakfast" at the small coffee spot down the street.  Its now almost 12 and am waiting for the last to finish their breakfast..then the beach comes!

      Sometimes I might refer to my biological father, Gary, as Biodad when I'm talking about him. I kind of like it. It has a superhero quality tone to it (Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's... Biodad!) The reason I refer to him that way is because I've only known him for the past few years and most of that was just via email.  I grew up knowing of him, but he wasn't a part of my life. I had a wonderful stepdad who was and always will be my 'dad' and so I can't quite bring myself to refer to Gary as dad and I don't think I ever could. So I like Biodad. Anyway, after my dad passed away I began to feel curious about Biodad. But I didn't really pursue it. It wasn't anything more than an 'I wonder what he's like' curiosity anyway. All I knew of him was his name, that he and my mother went to high school together and dated for a bit and I was the result. A typical story really. I also knew he worked for a newspaper in Montana. That's it.  Well around 1999 or 2000, I can't recall which, I stumbled onto his address and email online when I put his name in on a lark. On a whim I decided to contact him via email and just see what happened. I figured it would be nice to know whether he would care or if he didn't want anything to do with me. That way I'd never go through life just wondering. I'm so grateful I did.  I wrote to him, though I can't recall exactly what I said. I do remember saying something along the lines of 'I promise not to drag you onto Jerry Springer for a surprise reunion' or something to that effect. Nervousness brings out the comic in me. Anyway he found that amusing and after the shock of my email wore off we began corresponding. Then I introduced him to instant messaging and we began actually chatting. I found I had a sister just a little older than my own daughter whom Gary brought with him the first time we all met. It was just a dinner at Applebee's that first time but it was very pleasant if a little bit awkward :)  Since then we've talked a lot more and hooked up a time or two when he's in town. His own father, who would be my grandfather lives here in my town, though I've yet to meet him. He's retired and I'd occasionally see him doing the greeter thing at Walmart - I imagine he did that to get out of his wife's hair :) It was weird seeing him knowing who he was, but he didn't know who I was. Very odd feeling.  So that's a bit of background on Biodad and the reason I'm writing all of this is because I think a new step has been passed after his last visit this past week. I miss him now. It's another weird feeling. He and his wife have divorced in the time that we've been writing to each other, and he has a new girlfriend now. This past week was his family's renunion in another city here in nebby so he brought her down with him for the week and stayed at a hotel across the street from my place. This meant we got to spend a lot more time with them. I adore his gf and think she's really cool - she's a junior high school teacher which means she was able to get along really well with my junior high school kid and both of them were incredibly supportive for me while I was going through this whole job thing.  It marked the first time I went to him for advice and support and he came through for me bigtime. It also marked the first time he spent time with my daughter without me around as they "borrowed" her for the day and took her with them as they did an 'About Schmidt' tour of Nebraska, hitting the pioneer museums, the Imax, a planetarium and all that stuff. My kidlet told me later that night that she had an absolute blast hanging out with them. Later that evening they met me for dinner which happened to be on the day of my interview and then we retired to the lobby of their hotel while Gary restrung her new guitar with some nylon strings he bought for her and showed her how to use the electric tuner he also bought her. Then they had a few lessons which I managed to capture  urlLink here  :)  Unfortunately after that they had to get going to the reunion but yesterday as they passed through my town on their way back to Montana we were able to see them again for a quick coffee. And now today I find myself really missing them and wishing they lived closer or we lived closer. I'd like to get to know his daughter better because from what I know of her, she's a pretty incredible kid - a music wiz, a science wiz, wants to be a published novelist before she turns 21... I think that's really cool.  The other times we met Gary for a quick dinner and a stroll through a park it was really nice and all but I didn't have the feeling afterwards that I do now. Maybe because we simply didn't have a lot of time to really get to know each other in person and even though chatting online is nice and convenient - it's still just not the same as being there.  Anyway I'd better wind this up. I thought I'd write about it because you always see those long-lost reunions on TV where the reunited family members greet each other after years apart, or after meeting for the first time but you never get to really know what happens after that initial meeting. So this was my story :)

      CamdenTown is a part of London which became famous in the sixties and was a regular hang-out for lotsa rock stars. Since then it's become a place which attracts all manner of freaks (as well as plenty of tourists) coming to embrace Camden's alternative feel and shop in the markets. So I guess it was only natural that my first encounter with Camden would be at a TCZ meet back in 1997.  Well 7 years on here I am living in Camden - having been here for over a year and much as I love where I live, there's one small part of Camden that REALLY riles me up. It's a small stretch of road starting at Camden Tube and progressing about 200-300 metres up towards Camden lock. This is where the markets are and many, many shops selling things like clothes, shoes, tattoos and food (including magic mushrooms). And it's on this small stretch of road that a large number of people descend every weekend - so many people that they have to close Camden tube on a Sunday to make it exit only.  Now I don't mind lots of people, I've had to catch the tram back into Manchester after a United match with about 40,000 other people. What really annoys me is people who seem to have an inability to walk properly or to be aware of everyone around them. These people seem to meander on at a snail's pace obvlivious to those of us who just want to get home. They stop randomly in large groups which means you have to walk in the road just to get past them. Or they decide to stagger themselves right across your path and have a discussion about which shop to go in. They stop to take photos, with the photographer standing like 2 metres away from the photographee and then getting stroppy when people walk in the way. So I'm pretty frustrated by constantly having to negotiate this slalom course of idiots and I'd imagine they all think I have tourettes with the amount of evil glares and muttered curses ;)  And then, when I've just about made it to Camden lock I have to endure the drunk punks, the leafleters, the weed salesmen and today a nice man selling what initially looked like cakes his grandma had made - how sweet I thought, having only baked some fairy cakes myself yesterday. Well, I'm sure you can guess, these cakes would have you seeing more than fairies! His selling slogan was "Hash cakes - get seriously fucked up for only a pound".  So welcome to my world, and the small part of it that can seriously piss me off within seconds. But much as I hate this part of Camden, I know one day I'll be grateful when I'm going to a fancy dress party where the theme is goth/punk/freak - I know I'll definitely be able to get an outfit ;)

      So as I write this blog, daylight is rapidly disappearing, but definitely not the activity with it outside.  For this is the Swiss National Day, or as it seems for all the neighbor kids, fireworks day.  Actually, many did not wait till today. I heard many a firework exploding last night as well as throughout the day. But only now is it getting really loud.  Surprisingly, it does not seem that much different than the USA 4th, but instead of red, white, and blue, there are only the first two colors.  The Swiss channels are filled with music from the 4 different cultural areas of Switzerland.  Throughout the mountains, one can probably see many a bonfire.  I'm not Swiss of course, so for me its a manner of curiousity.  Perhaps a bit of annoyance, in that its a holiday that I don't get off as I work in Liechtenstein, and only live in Switzerland, but it doesn't really matter as it fell on a Sunday this time.  Incidently, I don't get the Liechtenstein holiday off either in 2 weeks as it will be on a Sunday as well. Oh well.  So how am I spending my Swiss Day?  Doing nothing..or close to it.  I woke up with a back ache that was most likely caused by my running down a mountain on Saturday at full speed. Thus, it was filled with me playing the odd computer game and lots of television, including 3 hours worth of East Enders on BBC Prime.  Amazing, how I managed to get myself hooked to that series.  So, a week from now I shall be at BOMO if all goes to plan.  It should be a nice change of place from the Swiss way of things :)
