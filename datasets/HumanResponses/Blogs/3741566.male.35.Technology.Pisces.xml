      Why does it seem that so many people live out their entire lives as if they were playing an unusually long board game?   I think I might have found something of an answer. These people have an underlying need to feel superior to those around them so they concoct elaborate mind games that they play out with friends and lovers in which the only person that knows the rules is the person that created the games to begin with. No one can “win” these tests of intelligence because no one else knows that they are playing a game and even if they do figure out that the other person is playing mind games with them they certainly aren’t going to understand the ground rules.  In this way, the person always seems to be winning in their own heads and therefore posses more intelligence than the people around them. Their entire lives are spent manipulating people so that they can feel superior in some way. Obviously these people suffer from severe emotional problems, the first of which is a total lack of self-esteem. They are unable to find self worth in the normal day-to-day things that most of us do so they must create elaborate fantasies in their minds in which they always come out the more intelligent, creative, thoughtful person.   The biggest problem with befriending these types of people is that they are completely detached from reality. They go through life with an unusually inflated ego that has no basis in reality. These people will think themselves far superior to those around them in innumerable ways and nothing in the real world will convince them otherwise because they are living in their own separate reality.  I should give an example. My now ex girlfriend Wendy is one of these people. Her ego is inflated beyond any rational explanation given the true facts of her life up to now. How did this happen? Well, it seems, Wendy is always playing out games in her head and all the people in her life are just the pawns she moves around. Every word spoken by other people and every event around her is woven into her sick perpetually running fantasy.   How did I figure this out? Well the fantasy she creates in her head is so far removed from the reality around her that it leaks out in almost every day-to-day conversation.   In her mind, she is a genius. In her mind, she is a successful writer. In her mind, the people around her just don’t understand her. In her mind, she is happier being alone. In her mind, she is a self-sufficient woman and that has gained everything in her life through her own hard work. In her mind, she is a heterosexual woman. In her mind, she has an enormous amount of close personal friends. In her mind, she is truthful and faithful to a fault. In her mind, she is the best of friends. In her mind, she has never lost and argument. In her mind, all her relationships have failed due to some fault in the other person. In her mind, she is a successful businesswoman. In her mind, she is this vibrant younger looking woman from years of hard work and exercise. In her mind, she is a caring loving individual. In her mind, she is a very creative person. Let’s look at the facts.  “In her mind, she is a genius”. This is the most laughable one. I had recently taken an IQ test and scored a good, but not genius, 134. I was happy about it and shared it with her. Her immediate response was “so what, I scored 165 when I was younger”.  I almost fell over laughing. While she is certainly a bright girl, this wasn’t someone that could deal with spatial problems in her head. This wasn’t someone that was adept at math. This wasn’t someone that any special skill in any area other than a decent, although not especially remarkable, understanding of the English language. A 165 IQ is reserved for people that are well beyond the norm. A 134 is in the 97th percentile (as I recall) and a 165 would make them in the 99.999th percentile. This is not such a person. I take nothing away from her intelligence, but I would never have considered her more than average.   “In her mind, she is a successful writer”. She actually has “writer” listed as her profession on her Yahoo profile. Her profession is “Marketing Manager”, although I gave her a loftier title so as not to bruise that extra large ego. Her previous jobs were, PR manager and various other marketing and PR manager supporting roles. Although she is a very good editor, in the year that I have known her I have not seen published works other than some of her old PR work. I have not seen manuscripts lying about. I have not read her book of poetry. The facts are clear. She is no more a writer than I am and her profession certainly isn’t “writer” unless you consider creating and editing marketing literature for a tech company “writing”. It is just more proof of her fantasy world.  “In her mind, the people around her just don’t understand her.” The reality is that most of the people around her understand her perfectly. Her friend Sandy had her pegged as a selfish individual who was more interested in talking about herself than in listening and helping Sandy with her substantial issues. Her ex husband Tim predicted her entire meltdown here in Massachusetts and the ultimate outcome of it all. He did this several months in advance! It seems that every friend I met of hers understood her perfectly as do Scottee and I.  “In her mind, she is happier being alone”. That couldn’t be farther from the truth. She has always had a roommate of someone living with her until now. In moments of truthfulness, she admits that her worst bouts of depression happen when she is alone. She has admitted that her alone times is when her negative self-talk is at it’s worst. This is why she surrounds herself with a ton of acquaintances. She can’t stand to be around any one person for more than twenty-four hours, so she has a multitude of acquaintances so that she can be around different people each day and not be alone.   “In her mind, she is a self-sufficient woman and that has gained everything in her life through her own hard work”. She stated to me once, in her usual fury, that I just couldn’t stand a strong independent woman. Nothing could be further from the truth. I love a woman that isn’t dependent on others and that can think on her own. Wendy just isn’t one of those people. She is 35 years old and hasn’t done a much of anything “on her own” yet. She was late going to college. Her parents paid for that until they mysteriously stopped and she had to drop out. She did however finish college through correspondence courses that were paid for by someone. To this day she hasn’t been forthright about who paid for them. The house she “owned” when I met her, turned out to be owned by her parents. She paid them rent. She claimed that a few years ago, she struck up an agreement that her rent money would go towards purchasing the house, but when she moved out to Massachusetts her parents mysteriously claimed that the agreement never occurred. She filed for bankruptcy after her divorce because, and I quote here, “ my parents wouldn’t give me money to pay my large credit card bills”. Does this sound like an independent woman? Every thing in her life up until now has been handed to her on a silver platter. I got her the job in Massachusetts. Scottee found her the house and made arrangements for her to move out. I talked to the movers when there were problems. We both helped her settle in to her new surroundings after being asked for help. There has always been someone else helping Wendy along the way. I have known many strong women, Scottee being a great example. A strong woman isn’t one with strong opinions, or one that can do everything on her own in life. A strong woman is someone that knows her limitations but is always trying to improve herself, not someone with strong opinions trying to hide their limitations. I give you more proof of the fallacy.  “In her mind, she is a heterosexual woman.” The fact is she had a love affair with a woman and professed to be “in love” with her. The fact is that she downloads lesbian porn and frequently masturbates thinking of being with a woman sexually. I certainly don’t think that it makes her a lesbian, far from it, but it also is proof that she isn’t the heterosexual female she claims to be. This is stark proof that she lives in her own fantasy world where her fantasy world is the polar opposite of reality.  “In her mind, she has an enormous amount of close personal friends.” The reality is that she rarely speaks to any of these friends. She claims to have between 5-10 “best friends”. I have known her for a year now and have met three of her friends. Three. Most of these people live out of state, which helps Wendy because of her severe phobia of being around other people for prolonged periods of time. These so-called “close friends” are really just email and sparse phone conversations that might take place over the year. Just enough information is passed between them to catch each other up on what each person is currently doing with himself or herself. These conversations are rarely if ever about anything meaningful. Emotions are not discussed. In the year we were with her she told only two “close friends” about her supposed love affair with us. Both of these people were male and one was an ex husband whom she lived with and couldn’t exactly keep it secret from. The reality is that none of her friends know much about what goes on in her day-to-day life, and none of these friends know the complete story of Wendy. She likes it this way because it perpetuates her fantasy that she is some mysterious person with a rich and meaningful life. The reality again says the complete opposite.   “In her mind, she is truthful and faithful to a fault.” This is the second most laughable fallacy. I can’t think of anyone I’ve ever met that lies as much as Wendy. She’s a compulsive liar that lies even when there is completely no reason to. The list is way to long to put into this post but here are some examples. She has lied over one hundred times about being late to work. These lies range from the reason why she was late, to lying about what time she arrived at work. She has lied about her reasons for breaking off prior dates. She has lied about her past. She has lied about being a writer. She has lied about her friends. She has lied about smoking. She has lied about snooping on my computer. She has lied about her whereabouts and she will stare you straight in the face and lie about what she is thinking and feeling at all times. I don’t think I have ever gotten a straight answer out of her but then I don’t think she would know how to tell the truth about herself. Being secretive and manipulating the truth is more of Wendy living in her fantasy world. In Wendy’s mind, being evasive and untruthful is part of the game. She wins if you don’t catch the lie and therefore she is the smarter person (in her mind). The biggest problem with this part of the game is that she also assumes that because she is always being evasive and untruthful, that everyone else around her must be doing the same thing. It has led to Wendy having severe trust issues. She is always looking to catch someone in a lie so she can “win” while at the same time being ultra evasive so she can win on both sides. It’s comical when you think about it since, as most rational people know, winning and losing isn’t the point and when you choose to believe that it is, you waste your whole life away being paranoid of those around you.  “In her mind, she is the best of friends.” This is a common mantra from Wendy.  The truth again lies far from this statement. Wendy has no clue of what friendship is. She is a user in the foulest way. The biggest part of Wendy’s game is the game she plays with those she calls friends. She feeds off their kindness and generosity while giving back the bare minimum. Wendy would expect that if she were having a bad day and needed a shoulder to cry on, that you would come running. Wendy would expect you to pay most of the time when going out, while saying afterwards, “you didn’t have to do that, I would have paid my own way”. It goes on and on. When she needs to talk, you need to be there for her. When she is feeling blue, you should have guessed at it. When she is angry, you should just understand that and not take offense to her taking it out on you. Wendy talks about Wendy, she doesn’t listen. She doesn’t ask. She doesn’t care to know. You can talk as long as it isn’t about anything serious or anything about emotions. She’ll call you when she is bored and wants to go out, but wouldn’t think of going out if she isn’t in the “mood”. In one year’s time, Wendy has never called or done anything that Wendy didn’t want to do. She expects you to be at her beck and call but also expects you to understand that she is an independent woman and needs her space when you need her. A great example of this was when my little girl was very sick one night and we needed to take her to the hospital. Scottee and I were very distraught and needed company to calm us, so I called Wendy and asked if she’d keep us company. It was about 9pm, she wasn’t asleep, but all I got back from her was, I’m sorry to hear she is sick, but I really have to sleep. Good luck tonight. I hope everything goes well. If it means getting up before 9am in the morning she will not meet you at the airport because it’s too much trouble. I’ve never seen someone as callous as her. I remember a conversation before we started going out that should have given me a clue. Her best friend Sandy was going through a rough emotional time and wanted to go down to southern California with Wendy to take her mind off things. Wendy, didn’t want to go because she didn’t want to “deal with her crap”, she did end up going, but she very quickly ended up doing her own thing while there so she wouldn’t have to “be a friend”. That is typical Wendy. If she isn’t talking, she isn’t listening. The last quote I’ll leave you with is one she gave early on in our relationship. She had just trampled on Scottee’s (her lover’s) feelings by doing something callous, and I had written an email to her asking her why. Her reply? Hey, I’m not responsible for other people’s feelings. That sums it up.  She sets new records in selfishness. Her comments of “I would do anything for her/him”, actually mean, I would do anything for her/him as long as it doesn’t interfere with something I had planned and as long as it doesn’t discomfort me in any way. It’s all a game.  “In her mind, she has never lost and argument.” This one best describes her games. When confronted with an issue that someone has about her behavior or something that she has done or said, she never loses the argument. Why? It is because she doesn’t argue. She uses deflection, which is a simple form of manipulation. If you were to say to her “I can’t believe you cancelled plans you had made with me” she would respond by saying something like “Well I can’t believe you think I’m always late to meetings”. Instead of responding to the actual issue, she deflects the argument and redirects the argument back to you. This puts you on the defensive and the original argument is forgotten, or if it is remembered later, she’ll use defection again until the subject is dropped, or you are so angry over her blind accusations (usually she deflects arguments with some preposterous statement out of left field to really throw you off balance) that the argument then becomes about YOUR anger. In one year’s time, I have never had her actually discuss anything that has been brought up about her behavior. She either uses deflection or simply stays silent and leaves. The dastardliest game of hers is after the argument. She will either do one of two things. She either, stays angry with you and refuses to talk to you until you decide to drop the subject and just move on, or she will actually apologize and admit “I have issues” and I need to work on them. The second choice is by far the most manipulative. Since she has admitted fault, you can’t bring the subject up even to ask her what she is admitting to, and then since she has admitted fault, she never actually has to change! She can just claim that she is trying hard the next time she does the exact same thing! This is what ended up being the last straw for Scottee and I. She has admitted to us that she has some real emotional problems and that she really wanted to try and work them out. She then said I need time to work them out so she could actually do nothing! If we complained about her not seeing us and being callous, she just could say we weren’t being understanding of her problems and proceed to have a reason to be angry at us and not talk to us for weeks. If we said nothing, she could just carry on like there wasn’t an issue and ignore our concerns altogether. It was a win/win for Wendy. She could do exactly as she pleased and continue to use us when she wanted company and forget us when she did not (which was 11 days out of 12) We finally realized that she was playing this huge game and we were falling right into it by caring. We stopped the cycle by not confronting the behavior and not going out with her when she asked. We used the same game back. When asked if anything was wrong, we would say no, but then used lame excuses to not see her or go out.   “In her mind, all her relationships have failed due to some fault in the other person.” The reality is once Wendy figures out that the person she is in a relationship is tired of playing the games, she breaks it off with them so she can claim that is was always her choice. In her mind, she wins again.  “In her mind, she is a successful businesswoman.” Reality: She has jumped from job to job and has either been laid off or quit all of them. She isn’t committed to any job because in her mind she’ll always be “better than this job” and she’ll always “deserve” better. To listen to her, she is always underpaid for what she does, and all her jobs have been beneath her. It’s an incredible arrogance and it has always been far from the truth.  “In her mind, she is this vibrant younger looking woman from years of hard work and exercise.” The truth? Guys love telling a woman that she looks younger than they know she is. I’ve got pictures, and they tell the whole story. If she wants to use that to make herself feel better fine, but she carries it further than that. The other lie she is fond of telling people is that she used to be “fat”. I have seen all her pictures and I have never seen her “fat”. Heavier than she is, yes, but not fat. I give her credit for losing weight, but I don’t giver her credit for exaggerating the whole thing. The thing with Wendy is that you never get a straight story. The story she gave is that she lost 70 pounds all on her own and that her current body is a result of all that hard work, The truth is that there is no way she was 70 pound heavier according to the pictures I’ve seen and her current body is a result of losing some weight she had put on and then SURGERY to create a flat stomach. That part is always left out. This is another example of her deception and lies. Her accomplishment would be just as valid if she told the truth. She lost maybe 45 pounds and needed help to get rid of the last little bit. That is more than most people could do. Why does she feel the need to portray herself as superwoman?  “In her mind, she is a caring loving individual.” If you were talking about her animals this would be true. See all the above for evidence contrary to that statement when applied to humans.   “In her mind, she is a very creative person.”  She used to be. She used to make music. She used to play an instrument. She used to write. She used to draw. She doesn’t do any of that now and from what I’ve seen I doubt that what she did in the past was her creativity to begin with. Wendy is a human voice recorder. She takes bits and pieces of other people’s thoughts, statements and work and spins them together as her own. I have given her every opportunity at work to be creative. To come up with her own designs, her own words, and her own ideas for websites only to be told that she hasn’t a clue. She is the first to be critical of someone else’s ideas, but when pressed, has no alternative ideas of her own. I don’t know if it’s because she doesn’t actually care about her job or that she just doesn’t have the creative spark she used to. Either way, she is anything but creative. In her own mind, she is another Emily Post, even when confronted with the facts.  I now come to the end of this post. Before I go, I should explain the title. Wendy plays multi-level games and in her mind she is master and commander of all. To prove this point, she added the caption “Grant no quarter” to her profile. Since she isn’t in a war, one can only conclude that she meant, “take no prisoners” in reference to the games she plays in her head. When Scottee calmly asked what she meant by that, she couldn’t come up with an answer, so she lied about the meaning of the phrase. Last time I checked, “grant no quarter” had nothing to do with the word “parlay”. It was either a lie, or her 165 IQ failing her.  Written 6-26-04

      Well I’ve been busy lately, but I thought I’d tackle something that I think happens more frequently than society would like to believe, fluid sexual orientation. I’ll cover my experience with it and also give my thoughts on sexual orientation as a whole.  First, as usual, I’ll give you a bit of my prior history to bring you up to the present on this subject.  My mother and biological father split soon after I was born. Dea (  It was about this time that I started to understand that Dea’s constant hatred of all things male stemmed more from her sexual orientation than it did from anything that had actually occurred in her life. It became apparent that she was actually a gay woman living a lie and the destructive part of her personality was, in part, a result of her inner turmoil. Dea ended up getting married for a fourth time long after I had left for the Army. It was shortly after that last marriage that she finally came out as gay.  I say all this to make the point that I am very familiar with issues of sexual orientation. I grew up with a natural “gaydar” that has proven to be uncannily accurate over the years. Not only does my gaydar spot those who are strictly gay, it also spots those that are bi and strongly bi curious. In fact, throughout my dating years and beyond I have always been drawn to women that my gaydar tells me are at least bisexual.  So here I am thirty-five years old and married to a woman who is partially out as bisexual. It has been a long road for her and one that she has nowhere near completed.   This brings me to the portion of this post where I stop talking about what has happened in the past and start talking about the now. Why do people have such a hard time admitting to themselves their sexuality? When they finally do come out to a friend or lover it still takes years for them to fully come out about with ALL of their feelings and thoughts.   In the early 40’s Dr. Alfred Kinsey came out with a scale that describes human sexual orientation. This scale was meant to show that people’s sexuality is a fluid thing. Most people’s sexuality isn’t set in stone and actually changes over time. The scale goes something like this.  0 - exclusively heterosexual 1 - predominantly heterosexual, incidentally homosexual 2 - predominantly heterosexual, but more than incidentally homosexual 3 - equally heterosexual and homosexual 4 - predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual  5 - predominantly homosexual, incidentally heterosexual 6 - exclusively homosexual  My current sexual orientation would be a one. I have only had heterosexual relationships but I have certainly thought of having male-male sexual encounters and am not allergic to the idea as a whole. I however, couldn’t see and have had no fantasies about these encounters being anything but purely sexual in nature. I also have no problem telling my lovers how I feel about it and what I have thought about (much to the surprise of some). I also am not ashamed of it. Although I certainly wouldn’t go about announcing this to my closest male friends, that has more to do with the fact that my sexual fantasies, heterosexual or homosexual, have never been a topic of conversation with them and I see no reason it ever should be. My sexual orientation leans heavily to heterosexuality and at this point in my life I have no plans or desire to ever be involved in a homosexual relationship. If at some point in my life that were to change, and I were to want to pursue a relationship with a guy, I wouldn’t have an issue talking about it with anyone, just like I don’t have an issue talking about my heterosexual relationships with anyone.  My wife’s journey though this scale has been drastically different from mine. While I have only recently even considered a sexual encounter with the same sex, my wife has been thinking and experimenting with the same sex since long before I met her. On top of this, she has only very recently come to even tell me anywhere near the whole story. As of today, she would tell me that she is equally heterosexual and homosexual, a three on the Kinsey scale.   I believe that she is a firm four and if I were to be even more truthful with myself I would say 4.5. Let me explain.  We were still dating when Scottee first confessed that she liked women. Throughout the next ten years she was steadfast in statements that it was something she could live without and that it was something she didn’t think of often. Wendy came along and changed all that. She finally admitted to what I have known all along, that she often thinks of women and that, more times than not, she is thinking of women when she masturbates. She also has now admitted that she knows that she could be in a relationship with women without a guy involved and be perfectly happy.  She has come along way in a short period of time. She now is very open about looking at other women and will comment freely on their attributes where before she tried to hide it (although she has always been poor at hiding it).   Watching her in love with another person has been an experience of a lifetime for me. I have been able to look at it from the outside and watch all the stages as if I were watching it on television, somehow detached from it. The only thing that bothers me is that, even though I have assured her for years that her sexual orientation is not an issue with me, she continues to hold back. She still isn’t completely honest with me about it. How do I know this? There are some good clues and also some things she said straight out.  Let’s start with the clues.   1. Scottee has never been a real touchy-feely person with me. It has always been an issue in our relationship that it is usually I that has to initiate sex or tender moments. I hear her now plan and talk openly about initiating things with Wendy days and even weeks in advance.   2. Scottee has never been one to comment on my body. If I am nude around her, it is also rare that she looks at me or even notices my nudity. When Wendy, or any other woman that she has been with, has been nude around her she can’t take her eyes off her and usually that is followed by her can’t keeping her hands off of her. She will usually comment on it as well.  3. I have never seen Scottee have an orgasm faster or harder than she will when with a woman. The mere idea of a woman being in her bed is usually enough to have her hornier than at any other time. The look of bliss itself after she has spent a night or even a few hours with a woman, speaks volumes. Although we certainly have had great sex, the looks and the reactions she has to women are something that has never occurred with us.  Now we can cover the things that have said straight out.  1. After one particularly wonderful night with Wendy, she came home in a tizzy. She almost begged me to make love to her, and while making love, I asked her as I sometimes do, what percentage dyke she was. Her reply was 95%. She went on to say, that she must admit that women are usually on her mind 95% of the time and that she sexually enjoys women much more than men. It was a very good night of love making. She has said later that she only said that for my benefit (she knows that it turns me on to hear), but I’m not stupid, I know the truth when I hear a woman cry it out at the top of her lungs.  2. On many occasions she has admitted that she is more sexually aroused by the female form and that given a room full of beautiful women versus a room full of beautiful men where she could pick any ten people to sleep with, at lease nine of them would be women…preferably all at once. J  3. She has told me that if we weren’t together, it is very possible that she would be with a woman.  This doesn’t sound like a three on the Kinsey scale. A solid four, maybe four and a half.  I mention all this not because it makes me jealous. Ah, I can see that you might be thinking that I fib. Well the actual point is that none of that bothers me. Why? It is because I know that Scottee loves me. I also know that she enjoys my company, both in and out of bed. So what if she is more sexually attracted to someone else? I am certainly not in a competition that I am aware of. In fact, I like seeing the lust in her eyes as she stares at lovely women. I like hearing what her dirty mind is thinking during those times, and I like seeing her come out of a shell that she had put herself in for so many years. It actually brings us together in a very large way because it is something we both share in common.   So why is it that I had to wait ten years in order to enjoy this side of her? Why is it that so many women hide what it is that they feel and think? In this modern age it seems beyond foolish to blame it on society and certainly beyond foolish to say that it is looked down upon. Society actually seems to have embraced bisexuality among women. Even if they were to not want to shout it out in public, why hide it from the person you love the most? It makes no sense to me.  Take Wendy for example. I have no real idea where she falls on the Kinsey scale. I could only guess. Why? I think you’d have to ask her. She is a walking contradiction. She is in a relationship with a woman. She professes to be in love with a woman. She professes to be deeply attracted to a woman, but at the same time, she has professed to not find women attractive. She has said that Scottee is the only woman she has ever been attracted to. She has stated that she doesn’t look at other women sexually. She wouldn’t call herself bisexual.   All this can be quite confusing until you look at the facts. She IS in love with a woman. When in bed with Scottee and I, she normally is completely involved with Scottee, with little interest in me until after she has finished with her. She has admitted to frequently masturbating to the thought of other women, and just like with Scottee, it seems that the male form (or at least my male form) isn’t nearly as exciting to her as the female form.  It seems that we have the mouth saying one thing while the body does another. Why is it important to me? Well first of all, the inconsistencies bother me. Second, it seems to be a pattern that she isn’t the most truthful person I’ve met when it comes to her feelings and thoughts. If she isn’t truthful about something that so obviously isn’t an issue with me, what else will she hide? Third, she actually gets upset when I’ve brought the subject up. Now I stay away for it altogether. If we can’t talk about something so basic, what does that say about the relationship? Fourth, it is something we have in common. Now that I’ve seen how much it has brought Scottee and I closer, it seems a shame that I have to steer clear of the subject. Instead of it being some horrible thing, it could be something of an awakening. It seems that Wendy is always hiding something. When she isn’t hiding things from others she is hiding things from herself. It is exactly issues like this that stunt inner growth. Truth is the word and the word is truth. Truth will set you free.   As Kinsey so rightly pointed out, being attracted to the same sex doesn’t mean you are gay. In Wendy’s case, I see her about a three on the scale, regardless of her words, but that is only a guess since the truth may never be known.   Sexual orientation is a fluid thing and labeling yourself for all time as one thing or the other is senseless, and on the same note, denying your attractions and burying feelings that you have whether they are sexual or emotional, is deeply destructive to yourself. It keeps you from really discovering the person you are inside and might keep you from really enjoying life itself. How can you walk around and be a happy mentally healthy person if you keep telling yourself such negative things? Denying any feelings and thoughts is always negative. Embrace your desires and learn to figure out what they say about you as a person. To me, Scottee’s desires only tell me that she is a much more complicated person than others I have met. I see her ability to see through gender and love a person for who they are as maybe her greatest asset and I am grateful for it. I just wish that both of them could trust me enough to give me the complete story. I have always shared myself on that level, baring my soul to the core.   The knowledge that my wife prefers woman sexually or that my lover is as attracted to women as men would never bother me. The knowledge that they both keep so much of how they think and feel hidden from me is the thing that makes me sad and lonely.   Just my thoughts on dealing with a partner’s sexual orientation

      My idea of starting to write down my thoughts and feelings started out as just a desire to put down on paper pieces of my past and present for preservation. I realize now that it is going to turn into something much more than that. It is teaching me to write, while at the same time, it is also tuning into a history of sorts. Not just a history of my past events, but a history of thoughts and emotions. I figure that I should expand upon this and start including much more controversial topics. Our current president seems a worthwhile subject.  Let’s first catch you up on my political views. Dea (biological mother) was a die hard liberal, which isn’t surprising because her parents were polar opposites politically. Growing up, I got both sides of every political argument. National security, foreign policy, social welfare, social morality, fiscal responsibility, and states rights were all talked about openly around me at one point or another. One would think that this talk would influence me in some way, but it didn’t. My political views actually were formed from observation and careful thought.   Growing up, Dea was constantly on the move. When I wasn’t being shipped off to Ma’s (grandmother) house every summer, I was in a different location geographically. Dea moved from NY to Florida, then up to Georgia all in the first 12 years of my life. I never lived in one house from more than two years and never was in the same school for more than a year. I’ll go into the complete ramifications of moving around so much at a young age some other time. The point here is that I got to meet an enormous variety of people at a very early age. I went to an almost entirely black elementary school when we first moved to Atlanta and that experience was the defining period in my life that would shape my political and social views for the future.  It was at this school that I first learned of racial hatred. I was the ripe age of eight at the time and was trying to form new friendships in another new school and was confused by the anger and hostility that I met. To a young child, a kid is a kid. The color of the child or their economic standing never crosses your mind when you are that young. Although my grandparents were the most influential people in my life, they lived in white neighborhoods and their bigotry was never obvious to me at that time. There just wasn’t enough talk around the kitchen table of other cultures for me to pick up on their ethnocentric beliefs. It was during this first year in Atlanta that I began to understand that the other children didn’t like me because I was of a different color than they were. Because this was such a confusing concept to me, I spent nearly every waking hour trying to understand why. I remember sitting up at night crying because I had been chased home again by the kids at school. They made, either beating me up, or chasing me to beat me up, a daily event on their calendars and to a boy of eight it was as traumatic an experience that can happen.   Looking back at it now, the oddest thing about it all was my reaction to it. I didn’t hate them for it. The more hate they vented at me the more I tried to make them like me. I became obsessed with trying to make them see me as something other than the little white kid in an all black neighborhood. I eventually befriended a family on my block, and although I still was chased and sometimes caught from time to time, the amount of terror in my life certainly slackened. It was during this time that I had the chance to spend a lot of time around that family. Their lives were, for the most part, very similar to my family. The thing that made us similar was that fact that we were poor. We both struggled to make ends meet and luxuries of the wealthy were completely absent. Had I been from even a middle income family, the friendships I made would have been completely impossible. What I learned from all of this was an understanding of society in America that I think surpasses what any wealthy family can understand. I learned that everyone on earth is more alike than society will ever give us credit for.   No I am not one of those fanciful idiots that sprout the garbage that “we are all of the same genetic makeup.” We aren’t. There is actually a surprising amount of physical difference between the races and there is even a bigger gap between cultures that is hard to overcome. The point that I learned as a child is that when put into similar circumstances, we all act very similarly. We all have the same kinds of thought patterns. We all self-talk and feed on negativity around us and we all have the same difficulty overcoming it.   I was only in that neighborhood for a year, and I wasn’t confronted with that much ethnic diversity again until I joined the army nine years later. I lived in mostly white lower class neighborhoods after that. It was then that I started picking up the racial bigotry around me. I heard adults sprouting nonsense blanket statements about other ethic groups that could just as easily apply to any impoverished group of people. My first political lesson in life was that bigotry and hate were ideals that I didn’t share. Once you can identify hate it becomes all to clear to see in every day life.  It was shortly after that I learned that my grandparents were part of that racial hatred. It was also during that time, that I learned that Dea was the polar opposite. She accepted and embraced different cultures and races. She certainly wasn’t devoid of hate, but to her credit, it wasn’t directed in that direction.   This all brings me around to where I stand today in the political arena. I am a liberal. Notice I didn’t say a democrat. What do I mean by liberal?  1. I believe that all people were created equal. We all are capable of love and we are all capable of hate. Judging a certain religious group, racial group, cultural group, sexual orientation group or any other group of people, by their belief systems is pointless. I don’t agree with most world religions’ philosophy. I don’t agree with a lot of cultural philosophy. I don’t live my life as a gay man. I don’t live my life as an Asian-American or African-American male. None of this means that I hate and none of that means that any other group of people is inferior to me because I don’t agree with them. It simply means that they have come to different conclusions about life than I have, or in the case of being a different race, they have lived in a social climate different than I have. This brings me to point number two. 2. I believe that victimless crimes do not exist. Period. I have never been given an argument that disproves this statement. If no harm is done to another person, it cannot be a crime. Hurting yourself is a victimless crime since you cannot be two opposite things at the same time, the perpetrator and the victim. This isn’t saying I don’t understand regulation, such as posted speed limits. Laws to prevent high risk behaviors are understandable, but only when the connection of the crime and the risk are well documented and understood. A good example of this is drunk driving. The risk of the person creating harm to others is too great to ignore. However, I fail to see a crime in not wearing a seatbelt after you are a consenting adult. Yes there is a risk that you MIGHT get into an accident and that your injuries MIGHT be larger due to not wearing a seatbelt and those injuries MIGHT cost more money to repair and that MIGHT raise insurance rates for others causing a victim, but that chain of thinking is dubious at best. Since not wearing a seatbelt isn’t going to alter your ability to drive a car responsibly and since that the likelihood of you dying in an accident is so much larger than if you were wearing a seatbelt (thus actually reducing the cost to treat you in the hospital – you don’t spend a ton of money on a dead guy and you might be able to use their organs), there is no reasonable expectation of a victim other than the person foolhardy enough to decide not to wear one.   3. Make love, not war. The easiest emotion to conjure up is hate and rage. There are going to be times when the only recourse for the defense of this country and the defense of our like-minded allies is military action, but these times are far and in-between. Most conflicts can and usually are resolved by calm rational thinking and time. The people that make war are never the people that actually have to fight in the war and are also generally not the people whose family has to fight in the war. Wars are fought by the poor. The rich and middle class enter service as officers while the poor are the grunts. Is this true in every case? Of course not! It does apply as a whole however. It is far too easy to send others off to die when the risk to yourself is negligible. Maybe we should demand that any president that makes war has a son or daughter that must go to that war and serve in the front lines. I guarantee that a president would try a lot more diplomacy given the prospect of losing a loved one.   4. I believe in equal rights for all people. I do mean equal rights. I believe that we should redo the court system to give equal rights to the poor. I believe that gay couple should have the same rights as straight. I believe that women should have equal rights as men and vice versa. I believe that no religious doctrine should hold sway in government in any way. We have the right to believe or not to believe anything we choose and we have the right to not be forcibly recruited. This means removing the word God from government altogether. You might ask me if I believe in a God and the answer would be, yes, I certainly do. If we are going to claim to be a free country then we have to be free in every way, not just the way that the majority seems fit. While I do believe that democracy is the best way to achieve freedom, I don’t believe that our current structure of democracy provides us that. We ignore the concept of individual rights too often in favor of the concept of majority rule. Just because the majority of a population believes in something, it doesn’t make that belief any more credible. The majority used to believe that women were not equal to men. Did this make it so? Was the refusal to grant equal rights any more sound just because the majority of people believed it to be? I believe that stronger language in the bill of rights is needed to protect us from the majority and create a truly free America. The people of today that strongly oppose that idea are the people of today that are the majority. The funny thing is that we keep forgetting lessons learned from the past. Today’s majority is tomorrow’s minority. If we don’t protect all rights today, then what rights that you enjoy today as the majority might be taken away when you are the minority? The problem is that these swings usually take a generation to happen and that the present generation rarely could give a rat’s ass about the next generation so we keep making the same mistakes.  5. I believe in equal opportunity for all. This means equal opportunity for the rich versus the poor, the individual versus the corporation and the minority versus the majority. Right now, this country favors the rich. I’m not one of those people that favor labor versus corporations to the extent that it buries our international competitiveness, but I do favor a shift away from run away corporate conglomerates and profit margins while the average American doesn’t make enough to afford average housing in most urban areas without it being inherited from a family member. I don’t know all the answers, but now that I live on the other side of the fence, I can certainly see the problems. Give me a few years and I might even come up with the answers.   6. I believe in government fiscal responsibility. I’m not talking about balancing our national budget. I’m talking about scrapping the whole system to begin with and using common sense to start over. Where do our priorities as a country lie? Do we need to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the wars (drug war and Iraq– twice)? Drop the budget in the garbage and start over using our heads. I want an education for my kids, and I want to grow old with security. Give me that and stop spending my money on senseless endeavors.   Here is where we come to the “Bush family recipe.” I use that tag line because he is our current president and it is easier for me to use him as an example of so many things that have gone wrong in America as well as so many things that have never been right. Without covering ever little thing that this president has done in office I’ll cover just two main points.  1. Let’s kill them all! The largest sign of hate from any individual is the willingness to physically harm others. The events of September eleventh are a perfect example of what happens when hate becomes what defines you as an individual or group. I don’t hate Osama Bin Laden. I understand why he and his organization feels so strongly about the intrusion of the west on their way of life and I understand the negative self talk that must be going on to produce and sustain this type of cycle of self destruction. The idea that violence is the only solution to a cultural problem is so obviously foolish. It is much easier to kill then it is to take the time to find other solutions. If I kill the person in front of me that I feel has wronged me or my culture, it is instant gratification, but actually does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Killing Americans or Jews or anyone isn’t going to educate them on your point of view. It is only going to steel their heart towards you and create hate. In turn, they learn nothing of you or your culture and in turn either want to kill you or simply continue with whatever it was that created the anger in the first place. It is a never ending cycle. Changing behaviors of individuals or country’s takes time, patience, and understanding. Because there is no instant gratification, it takes an intelligent person to see the forest through the trees.   George Bush’s answer to terrorism is just as foolish as Osama’s. The simple headed solution was to give America that instant gratification of the kill which is absolutely the exact same reason the terrorists attacked to begin with. Can we not learn from mistakes? I’m not saying we shouldn’t have gone to Afghanistan. We needed to protect ourselves from an obvious threat. If a bully has hit you in the nose, you do need to make sure he doesn’t do it again. The mistake Bush made was what he did after that and what he has said throughout the process. Any person even vaguely aware of the concepts of conflict resolution knows that you do NOT antagonize the other party. Don’t use generic blame statements and do not go into a discussion with the idea that you are right and they are wrong. Stick to the topic at hand. The topic was that randomly killing Americans wasn’t going to bring about the solution to the problem they were having. Telling them that their culture is wrong, that they are “bad” because they believe a certain way isn’t going to do anything other than create more conflict. While we were there, we should have gone through hell and high water to better understand what it is that they want from us. I don’t mean the simple answers of stop giving Israel money and arms, but a more basic dialog about what we can do better to stop screwing up in their eyes. Our government has always had this idea that their notions of policy are the only way to go about things and it gets in the way of true dialog with other countries. We should have been listening to the Middle East to see what we can do the change their notions about us as a country. Simply throwing money at other governments to buy loyalty doesn’t work because that money and support seldom reaches the people.   The only way to stop terrorism is to figure out why it is that they are angry with us to begin with. After that, we have to take real steps to change our behavior so that, while still able to accomplish our own goals, we stop the cycle of hate that sprouts and breeds terrorism to begin with. Who cares whose national ideals are right and wrong? Our goal is to protect American lives. Killing and hate has proven to never work on either side of the fence.   So instead of rooting out the terrorists and then educating ourselves so we can find a real long term solution to the problem, we play the role of international police and invade another Middle Eastern country. Saying “we didn’t find any weapons of mass destruction” so Mr. Bush was wrong for going to war, is so nuts that I often find myself shaking my head in disgust . The reasons for not invading Iraq were plain for the entire world to see. The only people that seemed to miss it were Americans. Let’s use common sense to debunk all the reasons given by Mr. Bush for going to war.  Reason One: “They are developing weapons of mass destruction and have shown the propensity to use them.”   Debunk: So what? North Korea HAS these weapons and actually said it would use them and you didn’t see Americans running off to invade them. The simple truth is that we knew Iraq was an east target. You don’t bully the guy with the real gun, you bully the guy that you know is full of hot air. The rest of the world saw right through this statement and knew we were full of it. Common sense was all that was needed to see the lie. Iran was also suspected of developing WMD and we weren’t asking to invade them. As a matter, of fact it was much more likely that they were further along than Iraq. They didn’t have international monitors and they didn’t have the United States bomb the entire country ten years earlier. They also have an “Evil” ( Reason Two: “ Saddam Hussein is a murderer and kills his own people. We have a humanitarian responsibility to stop him.”  Debunk: Ok that is a given. The guy was horrible. The problem is that he is not the only horrible dictator out there that kills his own people. Why did we all of a sudden care about this guy while we ignored, North Korea, China, about ten African countries, Syria, Iran, Cuba, and Haiti? Some of those countries would actually be far easier to take over than Iraq and some have far worse human rights violations than Iraq. In fact, Iraq in recent years, had come a long way in regards to human rights. The world again saw through this with common sense and again drew its own conclusions as to why Bush wanted to invade. I don’t know the real reasons he did, but I know that the reasons given were false.  The other reasons given were even more ludicrous than those two. There was the notion that Iraq was aiding terrorism even though our own allies and intelligence was telling us that wasn’t the case.   I do know the outcome of the “let’s kill them all” thought process incorporated by Bush. We have lost over 1000 Americans with no end in site, we have destabilized a country and driven up oil costs, we have alienated all of our Middle Eastern allies, and we have created more hate within the region than previously existed. It doesn’t take a research poll to figure out that we just handed Osama his next batch of terrorists to fight us with. Rational thought and common sense seems to have abandoned this president and many of those before him.  2. The second sign of hate from this president is his disregard and outright distain for those in his country. One easy way to spot a bigot in general is to look for other dogmas and self righteous behaviors from those same individuals. Believing that you are “right” and the others are “wrong” is the first clue to snooping out a hateful person. Those that think along these terms are more likely to also believe that because that they are “right” and you are “wrong” that they have the right to regulate your wrongness. They also are much more likely to believe that because they are in the right and you are in the wrong, they are “good” and you are “bad”. Labeling people is the second major clue of people that are prone to be bigoted, hateful, and self righteous.   Listen to our current president and judge for yourself. Those “evil wrong doers” need to be punished!. Since he is right and the world is wrong, he has a need to show the world and make the world see things his way.  He has shown distain and contempt for anyone not believing in his Christian God. You should say the prayer in school to his god. You should recite “in God we trust” in school. You should believe the same morals he does. You should not be gay because the bible says it’s wrong. The list goes on and on.   If I were an American minority, I would fear this man. I can see through to the hate when I watch him on television and I can see the hate in his speeches and in his actions. I don’t want to know this man’s secrets. I don’t want to know the hate he shares with his closest family and friends.    Note that in all of my writings I stay away from labels of right and wrong. I don’t label Bush as wrong. I think he is misguided and I think he makes poor choices in his life. Disagreeing with someone’s point of view or actions is far from calling them wrong and trumpeting you as right. As with anything I write and say pointing out things I believe to be mistakes, the point is to show that there might be other ways of doing or saying something that would have better results. The point isn’t that its “bad” that we make mistakes, the point is to show that we don’t have to keep making them.    The sad truth is this kind of hate isn’t what Jesus taught. It isn’t what Mohammed taught. It isn’t what the Buddha taught. It isn’t what all the great prophets taught. I hope that someday we’ll have a President that understands the concept of common sense and rational living. The Bush family recipe isn’t working and I fear that the damage to America the he has caused and which other presidents started might be too great to undue for future presidents. The idea of America was such a noble one but the idea that the development of democracy and freedom was accomplished with our current constitution is foolish. The founders understood this and drafted changes to the constitution to better define the idea of indelible rights as a human, which is why the bill of rights was added. We cannot rest on our laurels and believe that the task of creating a utopian democracy is finished.   Just like individuals, the government should challenge every belief that it has and always have an open mind to change. Just because you have always believed something doesn’t make it correct and just because something works, doesn’t mean it can’t work far better doing it differently.   AJ

      Hello all, I know I've been on a deep thought parade recently, but sorry to say, that's me.   How do you know someone's motivation? I'm not talking about looking through someone's words or actions and seeing jealousy or anger, I'm talking about seeing deeper. What is it that they say to themselves that creates the actions that they do?  There is a guy at work, that before I ever arrived at this new position, had a negative view of me. I have gone out of my way to help him out since I arrived and tried to "kill him with kindness", but he still goes about the company on a regular basis and speaks poorly of me. Although he can't give specific instances of something I did, he uses generalities to describe me to others that don't know me.  I can look at it from an intelligent common sense manner and understand that he is more than likely jealous that I came from outside the company to a higher position in the company and that he might feel the it is unjust that I have achieved this in far less years in the industry than he has.   That is the easy part. What I want to know is what is it that he says to himself that would cause him to open up his mouth and spew garbage about me that he obviously knows isn't true? I am completely incapable of doing something like this and although I certainly have some wonderful moments of destructive self-talk, that self talk never turns to being malicious. So what is it that people say to themselves that causes them to do mean spirited things? What is it that a lover says to themselves that makes them be cruel to one they profess to love? One is it they someone says to themselves that would make them be cruel to their children or pet? I'm sure I'll never know.  Even though I know this person has tried to be destructive to my career, I hold no ill will. To me, dwelling on it too long or creating my own self talk about how he wronged me, or how unjust it all is, only hurts me. Why would I want to be thinking such negative thoughts? I prefer to hope that over time he'll come to know that I am no threat to his career and only wish the best things for him and everyone else I work with.   Life is so much easier when you are at least attempting to see the positives in others actions and in them as a whole. I can think of many relationships I've been in that people wondered why I was with my partner because they were unable to look past the rough exterior of the person and see the positives within. My wife is an excellent example. If I had chosen to see only the negative inputs she contributed to the relationship, our marriage would have never made it to year two. She struggled for years with negative self destructive behavior that threatened to destroy our marriage. I stuck with it even when that destructive behavior became malicious towards me. Why? Because even through the worst of times, my attitude inside always remained positive. I thought that if I could somehow help her help herself, then the person I saw buried inside her could and would be set free. I was correct. My wife is now a very well adjusted happy person. It was the smarted thing I've ever done.  Wendy seems to be another example, although her self destructive behavior manifests it self in very different ways that Scottee's ever did. I think it might be because her destructive behavior has gone on for so much longer. Scottee was around a positive influence at an early age. Someone to lead by example. I use this term loosely since back then I was much less successful and maintaining peace within myself as I am now and currently I would guess that I am only 75% successful. Still, I think I was able to help her see that there are other ways of viewing herself and others. With Wendy, she hasn't had those types of influences and at 35 years old it has to be much harder to go through this self discovery process.   Looking back in her past, I can see that the people she surrounded herself with certainly haven't helped. When you are in a bad place internally yourself the worst thing for you is surround yourself with other people with similar problems. It ends up being a constant open sore with no one understand the dynamics. Self hate in one person has the tendency to rub off on others if the other person isn't very self aware of self-talk. Wendy's issues with herself aren't all that uncommon though. Although she sees herself as unique, it hardly make it so.   The self doubt she feels is exasperated by her being over 30. To her, she should have been out on her own by now, she should have been more successful by now in her job and relationships and because she is not, that confirms her own negative feeling of herself. She gives herself proof that she is unworthy.   The cycle of negative thinking is very hard to break because it feeds on itself through self fulfilling prophecies and through the reinforcement of negative ideals. Let me give examples.  The career cycle:  1. Wendy had dreams of being a successful writer. Here is the initial goal. 2. She set that goal and then went about trying to achieve it. She knew that the first step was a good education, but due to circumstances beyond her immediate control she was unable to attend more than a year at the prestigious school that she started out at. This is the trigger event for the negativity. The self talk probably went something like this. I am a failure because a didn't succeed at my primary goal of getting my degree from this institution. The problem is that "failure" is a negative and you cannot prove a negative. A positive outlook would have shown that she had indeed been successful at that school and proved her academic worth just by being there. Having financial circumstances that prevented completion is not failure in the least. It was the unreasonable expectation that life would go smoothly and that if it didn't she was a failure and that would be awful that set her up on a self destructive path. 3. By this time Wendy is early in the cycle of negative self-talk. She pulls out of it somewhat and figures out a way to get her degree. Although it wasn't where she wanted, it was still a degree. At this time the real world hits her hard and she is forced to use this degree to get a job that can financially support her, instead of focusing all her attention on becoming a writer. Because she has already labeled herself a failure she immediately uses this setback as proof of that label. She reinforces it with self-talk that probably went like this. "Yep I can't do anything right. First I fail at the one school and now I'm failing at my dream. I should have reached my goals by this time in my life. If I don't do something with my life, it will be meaningless." This negative self talk led and leads to feeling of depression and hopelessness and it is complete hogwash. Without that unreasonable expectation that life is going to go smoothly she would have had a more positive outlook. She would have said to herself: " so I can't devote all my time to writing. What new writers can? Most write at night and submit their work for years without success. If I work these jobs I'll just try harder at night and on weekends. I'm a damn good writer and I know sooner or later someone will see that." Instead the negative self-talk led to depression and more negative self-talk. Since I have to work, I'll have no time to write and that means I have failed in my life and I am a failure." That led to her never actually writing because she convinced herself that she was a failure. As a failure there is no motivation to prove yourself wrong. If she never writes she can never be rejected like she was sure she would be. Can we see the cycle? That was only one cycle, the other were with her person relationships.  What all this comes down to is that it buried all the wonderful qualities about her. She doubts her own work now (which I have seen and know is wonderful)and is so full of self loathing that she can't see the positives in herself even when the are staring her in the face. I've spent many a nights thinking what it waste it is. I wish I had a tenth of her talent at writing. I wish I had a tenth of her artistic abilities as a whole. Relationship wise she has a lot to offer any man or woman. Inside there is a caring, nice, beautiful woman that she won't believe in enough to let out.   I doubt I've helped much lately. I have to realize that I can't help her. I can only lead by example and hope that she figures things out on her own. I've tried to show her the negativity that has taken over her life, but I keep forgetting that there isn't any way to show someone that when they are in the midst of it. It only then feeds the fire. They use it as proof that they are a "bad" person because of past mistakes. They get caught up in being "right and wrong" and can't understand that it isn't about that. The whole idea of being "right" or being "wrong" is actually part of the problem. I want nothing more in life than for her to understand that she isn't a bad person, in fact, that she is quite the opposite and has every opportunity to lead a happy healthy life if she'll only give herself a chance.   In the mean time, it hurts to see, most of all because I've been there and know it is easy to escape once you understand the problem and believe that you are always your own worst enemy.

      Have you ever wondered why so many seemingly intelligent people get taken in by simple scams?  Have you ever wondered why seemingly intelligent people can't seem to think rationally in a relationship?  Have you ever wondered why the public at large buys into media hype?  Maybe I should have titled this post "why people do dumb things." I've asked myself these questions for the past twenty years or so. It's not out of curiosity, but more from really wanting to understand the phenomenon of seemingly stupid behavior. I think an underlying motivation is that I'd like to be one of the few that can avoid the same pitfalls that the population as a whole can't.  Ah so now you are saying, great, he thinks he's smarter than everyone else; hardly. I have, however, come up with some theories.  What constitutes human intelligence? I’m not talking about the ability to make tools or other scientific explanations. I accept that humans as a whole are already more intelligent than other creatures. I am asking what is it about one person that makes them more capable to deal with life than anther person. Why is it that one person can wade through life at so much an easier pace than others that struggle with just being happy?  AJ’s Theory of Intelligence (Someone else might have come up with this ages before and I don’t claim that I am the first, however, I’ve never read the theory before or came across it in conversations. I can claim that I came up with this version solely on my own):  There are two distinct patterns of intelligence in humans.  Innate Learnable Intelligence: We can call this “book smarts”. What I mean here is the inborn ability to learn and figure out complex problems. We could further break up this category into two sub groups: People that can solve complex problems and those that have exceptional memories.  Let’s give real world examples. Everyone knows that girl or guy that blew through college because of their ability to memorize from the text book and then regurgitate it later on an exam. We also know someone that seems to know everything there is to know about a specific topic such as history, literature, or some other science that requires a great memory. These people seem to be able to recite innumerable quotes without consulting a book. I label them as “memorizers.”  The other type of innate learnable intelligence is best described by the scientist. I knew a guy at my last job that was unbelievable at looking at complex problems and figuring them out spatially in his head. I think most genius’ fall into this category. These are the guys that end up doing well on IQ tests. I shall label them the “genius.”  The other type of intelligence I call...  Common Sense: I believe that this type of intelligence is also innate. You are either born with it or you aren’t. This intelligence is a lot harder to detect but it is something that people pick up on. We all know the guy that seems to wade through social complexities with ease, or that woman that just seems to have her head on her shoulders correctly. No, some of them can’t talk about nuclear physics with you and given an IQ test some aren’t going to score high, although they usually won’t score low either. These are the people that easily read through social bull, sometimes they seem like they are psychic in their ability to read other people.   So far most of you are nodding your head and saying to yourself, I am with him so far. Nothing seems groundbreaking so far.  I figured this out at about are twelve and at that time I thought I was doing pretty good for myself since it seems that no one else around me seemed to get it. It made me judge people differently and made me respect some people that others did not.  Shortly after that discovery I noticed a very odd thing. People that scored really well in one type of intelligence rarely did well in the other and some I would actually say were extremely handicapped in the other.  Let’s go with some more examples. That really high IQ person that I knew at my last job would be a prime example. He could figure out anything mathematical or electrical. I wouldn’t want to play him at chess either. When it came to social skills, he could barely function. He dressed like a complete slob. He couldn’t pick up the subtleties that took place in company meetings. Explaining human emotions of the opposite sex was useless. He also seemed to be alarmingly unaware of his surroundings. Here was a person that could build a modern plasma screen but I would worry about him walking out in traffic because common sense wouldn’t help him to avoid being hit by a car.   For the “memorizer”, I’ve seen the same thing. I’ve tried having talks with that guy or woman that could recite poems from a 1000 different writers or could tell me in precise detail the complete history and nuances of the Russian Czars, but when outside their comfort zone of memorized facts, felt so uncomfortable that conversations would end abruptly. This type of person can also be the most dreaded to deal with. This person can become the know it all with an unreasonable ego to go with it. The problem is that this person also will usually have a large underlying self confidence problem because in their heads is the knowledge that their intelligence stems from someone else’s work. Given the chance to show their own originality, they usually fall short.   The last example should be the common sense guy. That guy that flunked out of high school, never went to college. The guy that can’t seem to comprehend anything but basic math skills and still has trouble spelling your name after 20 years. Maybe there are also completely technology challenged. Do you know that guy that seems dumber than a box of rocks at times but is absolutely the guy you want next to you when the next ice age hit? This is the guy that knows to come in out of the rain. He somehow intuitively understands the man and woman courtship. He can spot and understand simple patterns that the genius missed. You probably wouldn’t want t play poker with him either. He is the guy who is great at the intangibles. You want to call him a genius right up until he opens his mouth.   The last type of person we have met is that rare individual that seems to have a good dose of both. I’ll call them the “Smart” person. This is the girl that can talk about anything and comes across articulate. She can pick up subtle hints from conversations as well as calculate the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow. This is a person that will score well on an IQ test and still operates in society well. I think of this person as having a higher actual intelligence than all of the others. Why? I’ll get back to that.   By now, if you are paying attention, you’ve figured out that I answered two questions from the beginning of this post.   Have you ever wondered why so many seemingly intelligent people get taken in by simple scams? They are the ones that lack common sense intelligence.  Have you ever wondered why seemingly intelligent people can't seem to think rationally in a relationship? Same as above  The last question will take a bit more discussion. It also ties into my intelligence theories rather well.   After I had figured out the differences in intelligence, and that most people are lacking either common sense or classically defined intelligence or both, I started to wonder how to quickly spot that rare type of intelligence. How do you spot the person that has both?  The answer to that led me to one of my other favorite ideas.  “An intelligent person asks questions”  I’ve had some lively debate about this one, until I explain what I mean by it. Then it usually becomes clear to people the truth of the statement.   Let us take a common media and scientific theory as an example of how different type of intelligent people might think.   “The earth is warming. The earth has seen an unnatural raise in temperatures over the last one hundred years that is caused by greenhouse gas production, a by-product of humans and the industrial revolution.”  The higher IQ individual might look at that statement, and if quoted by a respected scientist in the field of climatology, take it as a given. Yes it is common knowledge that human intervention is having an effect on the earth. The glaciers are melting and the summers are getting hotter.  The “memorizer” will simply memorize that statement and regurgitate it back over and over.  The common sense guy might wonder if it’s true, but won’t ask or research it because the topic might be over their head to begin with.  The people that don't posses much of either type of intelligence will take it as gospel.    The “Smart” guy is going to ask the question, Who says so? What is the proof? He has the intelligence to understand the topic and the common sense to understand that what is professed as truth is often far from it. He also doesn’t have to be a climatologist to see through to the reality. This is the guy that uses common sense AND his or her intelligence to probe the subject. They always will challenge ideas. They almost never believe anything until they apply their given intelligence to it and then apply common sense.  I can give an pretty easy set of examples now of the difference between the types of intelligence now.   A high IQ person can look at the data that the global warming from human intervention scientists and see that there is a correlation between higher CO2 in the atmosphere and higher global temperatures, thus confirming the conclusions.  A "smart" guy can look at the data and immediately figure out the large gaping hole in the logic of the conclusion. He will then comment: I see that all your data is from only the last hundred or so years. How can you conclude that humans are responsible for global warming without looking at pre-industrial revolution numbers or for that matter looking at the earth's CO2 to Temperature relationship across the entire lifetime of the planet?  A quick look at that would tell you that the earth has been warmer in the past and that with every rise in global temperatures over the last million years there has been a rise in CO2 in the atmosphere.. I’m not going to go into the absurdity of the whole thing here. You can read about it all over the internet and draw your own conclusions from the raw data. Just use common sense.   Now if you think on it you’ll know that guy that is always challenging ideas. Not just other peoples ideas but their own preconceived notions of everything around them. This person is always asking questions. This isn’t to say that they always are asking them out loud, some might sit and listen for a long time while they form the questions in their head. The tell tale signs though will be when you ask them their opinion of a conversation. They will have one, but not necessarily the opinion you think.   By now I have answered that last question. “Have you ever wondered why the public at large buys into media hype?” It is because the “Smart” people are rare. Most of the public blindly believes what is told of them. The truly great scientists are “smart” people. They have the common sense to always question and to draw their own conclusions, not borrow others. Even after they draw their own conclusions, they leave open the window of possibility that they might be wrong.   I could go on here, and more than likely I will at another time since this is a topic dear to me.  No I don’t think I’m smarter than everyone else. I know better, but, I do know to ask questions. So should you.

      Ok Let's start again.   By now I am in my early twenties. I was going in and out of meaningless relationships and was still searching for that last piece of puzzle to having a happy and healthy life. The answer seemed so close. I had managed to start reducing my anger somewhat and life seemed to have more hope. How was I doing it? I had no clue.   It wasn't till after I fell in love for the first time and went through a new hell I hadn't even imagined before that I really started to get closer to the answer. I was writing poetry at that time that dealt with how I was feeling and thinking during the pain. Although I didn't realize it at the time there was a direct correlation between the two; how I thought and felt.   The pain of that relationship was to galvanize me in ways I can only now understand. I knew I never wanted to feel as down as I did during those times. I started to slowly work my way out of the pain by taking steps to change my life. I met a woman named Linda during that time. Looking back, she was the start of my movement towards finding my answers. The relationship was just another in a long line of meaningless sexual flings of my early twenties, but the woman herself was anything but ordinary. One day I hope to find her and tell her the impact she had on my life just to thank her. Linda was a married woman with children that was separated from her husband. Although she was a highly religious woman she found her spiritual self torn between her beliefs and her sexual attraction to a younger man - me. She saw things in me that I could not see myself. She pointed out that, contrary to my beliefs, I was highly intelligent and that I needed to explore that intelligence through college. I laughed at her. I was from a seventh generation piss poor family and knew I couldn't go to school. I was as ignorant as any street kid is today. She calmly explained about grants for the poor and other ways the government helped out people like me. I hated being ignorant about it and was aggravated that some rich (she was a practicing psychologist which seemed rich to me at the time)woman could know more about the world than me. So I calmly poo-pooed her advice and ignored her as I moved on to the next woman.  The thing is...her words burned in the back of head. They burned like fire. I started to question myself again. Question where I got the idea that I was a second class citizen. Question where I got these beliefs about myself. Unlike most, I knew better than to blame my past. I had learned long ago that your past does not make who you are. You have control over yourself and your actions and you are not doomed to repeat things that happened to you. I wasn't my mother. I was neither verbally abusive nor physically abusive in any way once I reached adulthood.   So where did I get those idea? It was then it dawned on me that I gave myself those ideas. I told myself these things and therefore believed them just as I believed that food was needed for survival. You don't think to ever question yourself. It doesn't dawn on you to challenge yourself on such a basic level.   The idea was in my head now. Although I had a clue that I was the cause of some of my own ideals, I still didn't believe it 100%. I still wanted to blame others, since that is so much easier than believing that you could actually be so foolish. But even the idea was enough to start changes in me. Drastic changes.   I moved again to get away from other negative influences. I knew that I was still fragile in this new belief and that being around others that thought so negatively wouldn't help me pull out of it. Once I got to the new town (Melbourne Florida) I started looking into going to school. Seeing what money was out there for me. Seeing what I needeed to do to start.  It was hard. So hard to try something so alien to me. College wasn't a part of my family life. No one in my family went. I was completely alone at this time, struggling internally not to give up. Not to see school as some mountain to high to climb. Struggling hard to not think the word "can't". Six months later I enrolled in community college while I worked at a restaurant for a living.  Within a month I learned new things about myself and remembered some things I had forgotten. I remembered that I was adept at reading and languages. My teachers commented that I was a natural at science, humanities and English. I also learned something totally unexpected. I was a math whiz. Math came easily to me. Something that wasn't the case back in my "can't" days.   I started to gain confidence in myself. I started to map out a future for myself. I could see a future for myself. I started to believe that I created my own emotions. I controlled myself far more than I knew.  Shortly after I started school, I started seeing a woman I had fallen in love with almost a year before. She was the most radiant full of life creature I had ever met and she took my breath away. She had her own life issues as we all do, but it didn't matter to me. Here was a woman I wanted to grow with. Here was a woman I saw myself with 20 years down the road. Here was a woman I knew I would marry. My Scottee Beth.   Without going back into how I got where I am today. That last slow epiphany, changed everything about my life. Once I believed in it whole heartedly it helped Scottee eventually also to start understanding the same things.  Many years later during a very rough time in my marriage, when Scottee was going through her own personal hell, a psychologist I decided to see reminded me of what I already knew, which is very necessary sometimes. I also found out that my epiphany wasn't unique. The psychologist told me to buy and read a book by Albert Ellis that was written in the early 60's. It is called "A Guide to Rational Living". It was amazing to read all the things I had learned through my life. To see in words validation of my thoughts. It was also so necessary to remind me that rational living is something you have to work on every day. Something to have to remind yourself of all the time. Something that you will fail at many times, but that if you succeed even marginally, you succeed greater than you can ever imagine. It will change everything about your life forever. The book went on to give many examples, some I could relate to and others I couldn't. I keep the book nearby and reread at least twice a year to always keep things fresh in my mind.  Want to know the answer to being happy?  You control your emotions through how you talk to yourself. "You feel the way you think". When you stop beating up yourself for the mistakes you make, when you accept yourself as the fallible human that you are, you will stop having negative feelings about life and the people around you. Once you stop looking for the negative around you, you start seeing the positives and in doing so you become more positive and happy yourself.   1. When confronted by an event that can be interpreted in multiple ways, assume the most positive one. 2. Understand that you cannot prove a negative. You therefore cannot BE a loser, BE a bad person, because at any time you could stop losing and stop making decisions that are damaging to yourself. Healthy positive thinking breeds healthy rational thought and emotions. 3. See and accept people as they are, if who they are is damaging to you, move on. If you can create a more positive atmosphere and therefore change the part of a person that is destructive, do so. It's the right thing to do. 4. Don't get caught up in what people say. Look at people with all your senses. Hear then and see them. If actions don't match their words, be wary and refer to above statement. 5. Don't have unreasonable expectations of others. We are all human and we all make mistakes. Just because one behaves a certain way before it certainly doesn't mean that they will again. On the same note, understand that the world doesn't revolve around you, and that people will act in ways that you might not agree with. It's not the end of the world and it certainly isn't something to get upset over. It's what makes the world a more interesting place to live in.   Although I have no illusions that anyone will ever read this, I hope that someone does and that somehow it will make a difference in someone's life. Go out and find "A Guide to Rational Living" by Albert Ellis and read more of what I'm talking about. It's a short book and what do you have to lose?  AJ

      Quite a title eh?   I've always been a person that thinks a lot to myself. I'm not talking the normal idle chatter about every day topics. I'm talking about truly asking myself hard questions and going about answering them to myself. Some of my earliest epiphanies about serious topics came quite early in life.   I think I was around four or five and there was a very dramatic event that had just occurred with my mother. I had been playing around in the bathroom and had broken some teeth out of her comb. I believe it was the next day that she found out what had happened and flew into a rage. In order to punish her young boy she flung me down on the sofa and grabbed my "blankie" - At that time my "blankie" was a stuffed bunny, although it could have been an actual blanket like my two children have, that I carried around everywhere with me. I had it since I was maybe three. As every parent knows the "blankie" connection is a powerful one to young kids. - She then proceeded to tell me that if I couldn't learn to respect her property that she was going to teach me the consequences. She then proceeded to rip the bunny in half and throw it away.  It was the next day that my young mind was trying to find reason in what seemed an insane occurrence. So I asked myself a few questions. Why had she done what she did and what conclusions could I make from it. That might seem like deep questions to most for a 4-5 year old, but, it was the type of thing that was normal to me.   I asked myself those questions for a long time without an answer that satisfied me. I would come up with normal young boy answers but even then I knew that they were insufficient to explain why. By age six, there had been sufficient other dramatic events similar to the one above that involved my biological mother to let me know that this was certainly pattern behavior.   It was at age 6 that some answers finally came. The answers were simple.   Why did she do it? She wasn't happy. Not just generically unhappy at the moment, but unhappy as a whole. The problem didn't lie with me but with her. It wasn't something I did or said that triggered events, it was her. That was when it hit me that most kids have this silly notion that their parents are always right and this notion doesn't disappear for a long time. It is a completely irrational belief, but one that is understandable in a simple 6 year old mind. I had overcome that irrational belief early and because of that, it opened up whole new ways of thinking about life in general. I'd like to say that was a changing point in my life, but it wasn't. It was just that special point back in time that lead me to be able to lead a more normal rational life today.   By this time you have read my other posts and are saying, but your life is a mess! How can you possibly say that you lead a rational normal life? Well, what I wrote before was more the simple reality of my current situation void of my reactions to the actual events. I wrote it so you could understand the situation I am in today. Knowing the actual situation, you could then read later about how I view it and how I deal with things on a daily basis. Maybe it might help someone else.   Back to the subject  Although that revelation at 6 wasn't life altering at the time, it did enable me get through the next 10 years without committing suicide. How so? Well I understood, really understood, that unreasonable expectations about having a perfect life with a perfect mother only hurt me. The next big epiphany came much later. We can say for now that my life didn't get better over the next 10 years. Severe physical abuse (not sexual)and verbal abuse were a constant in my life and I began to develop very unhealthy reactions to it. I know now what to call it, but at the time I didn't. I would mope, I would feel sorry for myself (some would say rightly so), and I would agonize over my situation. It turned me into a very angry young man. I was self righteous, rude, angry, hostile, and sullen. I'm sure I was a complete joy to be around.   Some of the things I would think to myself would be:  1 Because Dea ( 2 Because Dea said that all men were the slime of the earth, and all the father figures in my life seemed to substantiate her claim, it meant that I too must be slime since I was a guy. 3 Because my life had no direction it was simply awful and I couldn't stand it. I might die any minute from the shame and humiliation of it all 4 Because I failed at school I must be stupid 5 because I am such a miserable useless failure or a boy, that I certainly will always be one 6 That happiness is something that is given not earned. I can't be happy unless I am doing something fun, entertaining, etc.   All of these thoughts made me angry inside. Irrational self talk always meant that I had to be right. That there had to be a right and wrong. Because if I was wrong it meant that I was bad and that would be awful.  Just after turning 16, I got an idea that most kids do. My idea was that I had to remove myself from the circumstances around me. The line of thinking is that by removing myself I will make it easier to be happy. Oops. Grass is greener over there. How foolish a notion. Looking back, although I know the logic is faulty, it did withdrawal me from a very bad situation and because of that, I put myself in a place to start fixing myself.  One month after my 17th birthday I joined the Army. All my problems followed me of course since the problem was me. Although I didn't have physical and verbal abuse in my face everyday, it didn't stop the damaging things I did to myself. It can really get stupid.  I wasn't as physically capable as other men in the army so I must be worthless. Never mind that I was far from a weakling etc. I wasn't as fast as others running, so it meant I must be less than they were. Never mind that I was far from the slowest.  My expectations going into the Army were such that I never expected a worthless person like me to succeed so therefore I didn't. It was a disaster. I "can't" became a word I was becoming way too familiar with. I would move from one self fulfilling prophecy to another. Two years later found me out of the Army and Married to a German woman that I wasn't even in love with (a story for a later time).  I am now 19 and just as angry as I ever was, although I was asking myself serious questions about myself and life, I was too angry and hateful to listen for answers. It was at this time that I started to wake up out of a fog. After destroying a marriage that I just knew wouldn't work (sarcasm), I was on my own again and looking down the long barrel that was life. I knew I had to do something. I didn't want to go through life feeling miserable....  It was that want, that desire to actually do something about the situation, that started the change. It was then, when I was about 20 years old that my next life altering epiphany. I call it my first universal truth. A universal truth is a truth that cannot be proven wrong under any circumstances. It was so profound to me that it started me thinking in new ways.  "People do what they want to do. People don't do what they don't want to do" That is an original from me. Right now you are saying well duh, or so what!  If you honestly believe that statement, TRULY believe that statement, it will have an affect on how you relate to other people throughout your life. Let me give an example to help you understand.  EVENT: You call up your girlfriend/boyfriend and they say they can't go out tonight because they have clothes to wash and other chores.  Someone who doesn't understand the statement above, usually misses the basic point that she/he didn't want to be with them. If they had, they would have worked around any obstacles in the way. This might be a one time thing that has no overall value or it might be a trend that the other person should be aware of. In listening to their words instead of their actions, the other person might be headed down a relationship with significant issues from the start. The problem is that most people lie. "oh I really want to see you but I have to do laundry" is a lie, period.    I believe the above statement so I KNOW she has made a choice between seeing me and doing clothes. She has chosen to do what she wants to do. Since she doesn't obviously want to see me, I accept the reality of the situation and realize that I have two choices. If I want a relationship with her/him, I better figure out how to be more attractive than doing laundry, or I need to just move on to another relationship since her/his interest in this relationship is obviously lacking.  Because I believe in the universal truth, it eliminates the unknown for me. I'm not asking myself if she REALLY wanted to do clothes more than see me. I already know the answer. Now it is just up to me as to how I'd like to react to it.  So how did this help me in my life?  Well it helped me weed through all the bullshit thrown at you from other people. I stopped listening to people's words and started looking at the reality. It showed who around me was sincere. I could match words with actions and when they didn't match, I would move on   So now I had another tool to help me be happy. Was I? Not hardly! I was missing one more answer to my problem. By this time, I certainly wasn't doing to bad. I knew better than set large unreasonable expectation of people (still hadn't learned that I was setting smaller ones constantly)so that helped me somewhat in dealing with letdowns in life. i also had learned a universal truth that helped me see through a lot of garbage that clouds other peoples judgement.   Stay tuned for Part 2 of how to be happy and read what the last component was.

        Ok, let me continue.  So I have moved from California to Massachusetts arriving on January 13th of 2004. Of course it had to be one of the coldest January's on record didn't it? I got Wendy a job offer with the company by early February.   How did she respond to the job offer? Funny you should ask. She looked for every reason in the book not to accept the offer. Maybe that should have been my biggest hint that her heart wasn't in it. After numerous talks with Scottee and I about the move, with us pleading that she come out and give it a chance, she finally made the decision to give it a try. I should mention now, her situation in California.  1. She left the position of PR Manager at the company I worked for when she found out I was moving 2. She took a job at a medical company that offered her one type of position and then when she got there she found out it was something else altogether. She wasn't happy at all. 3. She lived in a house her parents owned with her ex-husband and had never been really out on her own 4. Her parents had long since moved to Florida, leaving her in California with her ex and a hand full of other friends that hadn't moved out of California yet.  The idea of leaving the security she had become accustomed to was terrifying to her. She was born and raised in the bay area and couldn't actually visualize a new life living somewhere else even though she had talked of nothing else but getting out of California every since we met. More talk than action, which I think I can understand even if I can't relate.  By early March she had made the leap and came out and that's when things got really bad. From the moment she got here she was looking for reasons that it wouldn't work. She was on a mission to fulfill her own prophesies in her mind. We had found a nice townhome for her a couple of miles away from our home that we thought would be perfect for her and I even ponied money out of my own pocket to pay off the leasing agent who found the place for us (which wasn't easy because money has been very tight - moving costs a ton). From the moment she arrived she found every reason to hate the home, hate the area and just be angry in general. I still don't remember a time when she just said to me "thank you". Thank you for getting me a great job. Thank you for taking time to find a good place to live in a nice neighborhood. Thank you for helping me move in. Thank you for going out of your way to make everything easier on me every chance you got. It's depressing to think back on.   Her furniture didn't arrive until 2 1/2 weeks later which seems to be typical of these moving companies. We expected her to stay with us since we have a large house and plenty of room for her and her two cats and one dog. We also had the eating utensils, stove, washer and dryer, and most important...us! She couldn't do it. She couldn't be in that family environment for more than a few days. Within a week, she had asked for an air mattress and was sleeping in an empty townhome. Scottee and I knew then that we were in trouble. From there, the same pattern that happened in California arose. The pattern is so typical that you can actually map it out now.  PHASE ONE: "HAPPY" 1.Everything is fine, sex regularly, lots of talk of a future together from her, plans to go on trips together, and lots and lots of I love yous. 2. This phase never lasts more than one week. Ever. It has been 9 months and this phase has never lasted more than a week.  PHASE TWO: "THE EVENT" 1. Something happens to "annoy" her. Since she is looking for something to go wrong from the beginning to fulfill her prophecy that the relationship is doomed and that no one really understands her and no one really loves her etc, it doesn't take long before she finds some action or words, that in her mind, justify anger. 2. The event is usually followed by immediate body language that betrays her anger. She all of a sudden has to go home, or has a headache, or has something she has to do anywhere but with us. This is followed by her immediately breaking any plans that might have been made for the following night and next day or several days depending on how angry she is.  PHASE THREE: "EGO" 1. Since she has broken plans and made it clear that she is annoyed either verbally, through her actions of breaking plans, or by her body language, it is inevitable that we ask "what's up" and/or "why do you not want to be around us?" We might simply ask why she is angry. This might be in email or in person, either way it elicits the same response. 2. That response it always the same. RAGE. Unreasonable and unexpected RAGE. She lashes out verbally and uses anything at her disposal that she feels will hurt one of us. There have been so many hurtful and mean things said during these times I couldn't possibly write them all down. It usually revolves around exposing any character flaw that she feels we have and throwing it at us. I can't tell you how bad this time is and how bad it hurts to have someone you love rip you apart time and again. Usually the rage is directed at one or the other of us very rarely both. This pits Scottee and I somewhat against each other. Most times the rage is towards me, but a few times against Scottee.   PHASE FOUR: "THE MOOD" 1. Shortly after the initial rage follows the after math. Rage usually lasts only a few hours and "The Mood" phase usually lasts anywhere from one week to three weeks (god I wish I were kidding here". The mood phase is actually the worst).   It starts after the rage.   1. Whomever she had the rage against, she won't talk to period. Simply ignores their existence.  2. The other party she starts talking to right away. At first this is to vent what an ass the other one was and how DARE we do whatever it was that put her into the rage to begin with. It doesn't end there. The real fun begins.  3. She starts in on what a screwed up relationship this is. How Scottee or me just can't seem to be happy. How that she can't deal with all the drama, that she is worn down by it all, she is tired, she doesn't want this anymore, she is moving away as soon as her lease is up, she is leaving the job as soon as the lease is up, the I or Scottee are seriously screwed up mentally, that she needs to find a "real" relationship, etc etc etc. It goes on and on. The most hurtful crap that anyone can say. She knows that we tell each other this and feeds off the hurt she causes. She has to make sure she punishes us for whatever harm we supposedly did this time.   The worst part of this phase is the harm to the relationship she causes to the one she DIDN'T rage against. How would you like your lover telling you that your relationship isn't real, that she is moving away the first chance she gets, that she needs to date to find a "real" relationship etc, when it wasn't you that she was mad at to begin with? The hurt is causes goes beyond words. We end up thinking that she is only in the relationship because of the other person. That our (either her and Scottee's relationship or mine and her relationship)exists just so she can be with the other one. Why else would someone say these things?  This phase lasts anywhere from a week to three weeks. During this time it isn't unusual for her to go out with other friends or out to events and genuinely act as if she couldn't care less that the relationship is over.  PHASE FIVE: "OOPS SORRY". 1. This phase can only begin once we stop talking to her completely. She has to be alone by herself without us being antagonistic in any way (which means not talking at all since anything we say during phase four will be construed as us telling her she is wrong). After she has sat on it and thought and gone all through her self hating self-talk she gradually comes out of it. This phase is started when she finally calls us. She then says something to the effect of "I don't know why I was so angry or I don't know why I do that". It is then followed by "I really do want to be in this relationship" and "I want to make it work". We then have actual meaningful conversations. This phase usually lasts for about three days to a week. The relationship gradually gets better until finally we are back to phase one. Then it starts back again.  The end result is that phase two is always just around the corner. I'd like to believe that one day she could find peace and be happy, but the outlook is getting dimmer and dimmer. Let me explain.  In 9 months time here is what has transpired.  At least 30 dates cancelled (if I were to count I'm sure it would actually be more like 50). This can be as simple as not coming over for dinner, canceling shopping trips with Scottee and canceling sleep overs to large events like canceling plans for thanksgiving, Christmas, her birthday, and canceling weekend vacations that are already paid for. Oh I wish I was kidding here. It has gotten to the point where we just expect her to cancel. Usually the bigger the plans the more likely she'll cancel. The canceling always occurs in phase three and four.   In 9 months time, I personally have had sex with her less than any woman I have been with for a month. Because the only time sex happens is in phase one, that means that sex usually only takes place in one week a month. Add in Aunt Flow and similar things and it has averaged that we've had sex less than twice a month. Not bad for a new relationship eh? Her and my wife's track record there is even worse.   Well that is where we are at today. Currently we are in a phase four. Two weeks ago we came out of a monster phase four and into a good phase five. In this time she was great, coming over all the time and being awesome. My wife left for Florida for two weeks on Sunday and she slipped into a phase one with me. We spent almost all of Sunday together. Everything was great. Better than it had ever been actually. Monday she feel asleep upon coming home from work and our plans got cancelled. Tuesday everything is going fine until, oops, phase two and three hit hard. How did is start? Why does it matter? I asked a question that in hindsight I should have known better to ask. She took the question as me being an ass and "babysitting" her and within 60 seconds we had entered phase three.It wasn't as bad as other phase three's have been, she only said mildly hurtful things and cancelled plans for a four day stay in Maine next month that had been made for the three of us. The funny part is that less than an hour before she was telling me how much she wanted to go. It wasn't surprising since she has cancelled those plans three times now. When I made them I knew that the odds were against it ever happening. Scottee and I will go, and it won't be the same because we'll both have Wendy on our mind. This time she made sure that the she can't change her mind again and go with us by making plans to go to Florida and see her family. She will have bought a ticket by now and that will be her excuse later of why she didn't go.   So here I am in phase four. She entered it yesterday 3 hours after entering phase two by saying she was done talking about it and that she was going to cancel plans we had for last night. I didn't hear from her last night and although I don't think she'll stay in four for very long at all this time, the damage to me has been done. I am making plans with my best friend Darrell for the weekend to make sure that I am occupied. Last night Darrell and I went out to a bar and played pool for a few hours with a friend from my work. It was a good time and it got my mind off things. I'll just find things to do for the next two weeks till Scottee and the kids come home.   Well that is where we are at currently. I stayed away from going deep into feeling and thoughts about all this. I just needed to explain this situation in generic terms. The the next posts will be about the feelings and thoughts I have about the current situation and then I'll move on to broader topics, past experiences. My life has been full and wonderful so far. I have a lot to share.

      Must read below to understand this blog....  So now we start a sexual relationship. Scottee (wife) and I go over to Wendy's one day shortly after finding out that she was interested in us both and I gently lead the two of them to an inevitable night in bed. Everything was wonderful.  Why must good starts always go so wrong? At first everything is good. Sex was enjoyable and the friendship was going strong. Working with Wendy while sleeping with her also didn't seem to be a great hurdle. Looking back, I think I know where things started to go wrong.  My wife and I started to have feeling for her. Maybe if we had kept it just a friends with benefits situation things would have been ok. Scottee and I talked about things for a long time before we started to express our feelings with her. To our delight, she said she shared our feelings and was falling in love with us both. The problem was, her mouth was saying one thing while all her actions spoke the opposite. She started making excuses for being too busy to see us, broke just about every date we made with her, lied about what she was doing, and simply always seemed to have more important mundane crap to do then to spend any time around us.   This ended up being the cause of many a blow up. Once the feelings of love come they are not easily put away. I saw my wife in love with someone else for the first time in my life. While wonderful to see, it was also very painful because the person hurt her in so many ways. She or we broke the relationship off on a few occasions and were ready to cut our losses, but every time we broke apart, Wendy would be back saying that she really wanted the relationship to work out etc.   The relationship started last year in early August and it went on like this until fate stepped in and took a hand at shaping my future. I took a business trip to the east coast to see a few dealers and visit some executive at ABC in NY. Wendy had gone with me on this business trip and things turned very sour midway through the trip. She had done her usual angry routine that had become her trademark and while in the Boston area, much to my surprise, I was offered a job by one of the dealers I was visiting. I job offer I couldn't refuse.  I should diverge at this point and say a bit about my career to explain. Back in early 1998, I had taken a sales job in the audio visual field in Tampa, Florida. I worked hard for four years there with a goal of becoming much more than a simple sales person. My success there was almost overwhelming. I set higher and higher goals for myself and kept meeting them until it became apparent that I had hit a ceiling for my career there. At that point in 2001 I understood that I needed to do things at my current job that would enable me to jump ship from that company into a higher position in another company. I worked hard over the next year and eventually it became known in the industry that I was an expert in the field of home theater and in the field of projection and display technologies as a whole. In April of 2002, an opportunity arose with a display technology manufacturer and I took the job.   At first my job at the manufacturer was as product manager. At that level I was able to work remotely from Tampa. That didn't last long. One month into the new job the CEO fired my direct boss and hired me as Director of Product Management of the US. It was then that pressure started coming my way to mover out to company headquarters in the San Jose area of California. I agreed and made plans to sell my house and move. By my birthday 2003, I had driven across country and settled in San Jose. By this time, I had been promoted twice more and was now General Manager of the company and head of product development worldwide. This is how I ended up hiring Wendy as our PR Manager.   I said all that to explain my frame of mind when I was offered the Job in Massachusetts. Although my wife and I loved it in San Jose, there were some problems living out there. I worked for a Taiwanese company that traditionally underpaid for the position I was at. My wife is a stay at home mom since shortly after our first child was born and we have both agreed that she is to stay in that position until such time as she wants to go back to work. The cost of living in the bay area was sucking up our savings and it was becoming obvious that staying out there was going to sooner or later mean that I'd have to get a raise or that we'd have to drastically cut back expenses. When the job offer came, there were so many positives that I couldn't ignore them. Let me list them for you.  1. Half again as much money with the opportunity through bonuses to soon make over twice what I was in California 2. Lower cost of living, although still high compared with Florida 3. I was born in NY and had always loved the New England. 4. The people here were far more friendly open and honest than any I've met anywhere in the country. 5. Best public schools anywhere in the US. (I don't live in Boston) 6. Less traffic 7. Bigger house on two acres 8. A better title on the resume (Vice President). I know it might sound shallow but when you have a family to feed, small things become important.  The list went on and on, so it was a no brainer for Scottee and I to decide to move. Only one thing really stood in the way, Wendy. We were both very much in love with her, even though Wendy wasn't the most emotionally stable person we've ever met, you can't choose what your heart decides.  We told her of our plans and as expected, all hell broke loose. I think she just wasn't in a place in her life to understand what was going on and she was certainly not in a place emotionally to deal with us leaving.  We said our goodbye and drove across country again out to Acton, MA. Everyone knows long distance relationships don't work and this one was no exception. Within a few weeks it became obvious that Wendy was taking it very hard. I won't even discuss how bad Scottee and I were taking it.   The thing about me that I hope everyone learns is that I have certain values and ideals that I live and think by and these ideas are absolutes to me. I knew I didn't want this relationship to end so I went about making it work. I knew I could desperately use her at my new company for the things I needed to do here. In all honesty she was by far the most qualified for the position I needed and it was easy to convince the owner of that.   It was really putting my ass on the line. The risk is that I have the company spend 10k in moving her out here and that she flakes out again and quits. With her it was a distinct possibility. My heart won out and I we sent her an offer letter.  Stay tuned for the next installment (the last few months of drama)

      To bring you up to speed.... I have hired Wendy as my PR manager for the company I was working for out in California and we had become friends.  I introduced Wendy to my wife Scottee not too long after Wendy and I became close friends. I was hoping that they would hit it off since my Wife was new to the state and certainly could use some friends. She is a stay at home mom and I know how tedious that can be.   We all went out one night and had a great time playing pool and drinking and I became aware that Scottee was certainly attracted to Wendy. Scottee had numerous (9) relationships with women since we had been married so her attraction to a woman certainly didn't come as a shock.   The next day after going out I was having a casual IM conversation with Wendy while at work when she dropped a rather large bomb on me. She mentioned that she had always wanted to experiment with a woman and she found Scottee to be very attractive. Normally this wouldn't come as a major shock since this kind of situation certainly wasn't new to me. Scottee had been turning women's heads for quite some time. In fact, I often wonder if she is giving off major signals that straight, bi, and gay women unconsciously pick up on. The thing that floored me was that Wendy and I had previous conversations about bi women and she had made it very clear that she had never entertained the thought.  So that day I spent relaying messages between Wendy and Scottee that they were both very interested in each other and might want to explore the possibility of being intimate. At the same time, I learned that Wendy was also interested in me, which was nice since it would allow me to participate in the intimacy. I had always found her quite attractive.  Enough for now. I'll also post pictures of Scottee and Wendy.

      I was born in NY 35 years ago to a mother that didn't really want children and I father that certainly didn't want children. By the time I was one, the father had left and the mother had dropped me off with her mother to raise and look after. About the age of five, that same mother figured she'd give it a shot and I was moved to South Florida.  Move forward eleven years and you find me again in South Florida after having lived in the Atlanta area with my mothers third try at a husband. She left him and moved to Ft. Lauderdale. I'll have to leave out the specifics of what was going on during all this. I think that will be an entirely different blog.  Move forward to December 1994, and I am getting married to Scottee in Melbourne Florida. One child Auston comes along in 1998 and a the second child Sammie enters in 2001. Still married in 2004.  Spring time close to summer in San Jose California found me hiring a very beautiful woman named Wendy as our companies PR manager. My relationship with Wendy turns from work to friends within a few months. July 2004 and Wendy meets my wife Scottee and things get very interesting from there.   Ok that is the short draft of how I got to be here. I'll be writing a lot from here on out about my current situation as well as posting about the past. So much to tell and so little room to tell it in.  Bye for now good readers.....AJ
