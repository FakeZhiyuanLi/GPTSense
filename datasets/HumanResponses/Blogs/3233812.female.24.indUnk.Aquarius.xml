      Its looming. We've kinda played with this site (and tinkered with the layout) but the dispersement that caused its creation is coming and ever sooner. My room is full of boxes, half of my roommates stuff is already gone, Kim's had her garage sale and is also living among boxes, I have an application for Harding that I need to get off and in the mail (yes I am about to work on an MDiv). The leases are up the end of the month. Its an awkard thing to be remaining here longer than most of the others (I'm glad you will be here this summer Sarah!).   I need to work on fundraising, move my stuff into Edwards, see Kill Bill I (if i am going to see KB2 with the rest of 'em), and who knows what else. On a way exciting note I found enough little stickers to fill my subway card so I get to sit here with Amanda and Sarah watching the Return of the King and eating a free subway wrap (and not thinking about what else I should be doin)!

      I miss you all already.  Kim and Amanda how are you doing?  Reading Amanda's blog, it sounds like she is taking it easy.  That's great.  Give yourself some free time.  You both definitely deserve it.  We all do.  It is so weird, everyone going in their separate directions.  I did this several years ago, saying good-bye to friends, and now I am doing it all over again - having to start from scratch to find new friends to hang out with.  I am still trying to finish up Harry Potter, but I think Jen is going to be mad b/c I won't have them finished by this weekend.  Another kink in the matter is I am doing a Middle School retreat this weekend, so I don't know if I will have time to go.  So Jen, I think you should go without me.  If Kim or Amanda were still here they would go with you.  Sorry I am not as good of friends as them. :)  I really do miss you all and can't wait to hear from you, especially what the Lord is doing in your lives.  Talk to you soon.  Blessings and Peace.

      There isn't much here, I guess we are all busy.  I'm currently semi-helping TeamKids Wednesday nights at church.  Just wanted to update this blog, it's getting a little sad.

      Today I attended a Lutheran service for the first time ever.  Of course it was different than my CoC tradition but I was not totally lost thanks to the worship class I class I took.  I felt it important to experience other worship services and not just talk or learn about them.  I have to say I did like it.    There was one part I did not expect but I liked it alot.  There was a time in the service where we shared peace.  Members exchanged "peace to you" or "Peace to God."  And that brought a smile to me.  There was something about saying and recieving peace.  For me at least it allowed me to become a part of a whole and not just a separate piece.    So, I say to you "Peace be with you."

      I've decided to relocate my blog.  I figured most of my other fellow friends and bloggers use the place I thought I'd join to.

      I did it. I made myself watch John Kerry's whole speech. I did watch John Edwards speech but I was also switching it with Newlyweds so I didn't see the whole speech. Yes, it was a well delivered speech but I was not inspired. I guess because I was fed the usual of what politicians say to get your vote. It will be interesting to see Bush's speech and see if he responds to Kerry's criticism.  I've decided to pay attention to the race this year because I am undecided, I don't even have party on my registration card anymore. So, I guess I'm in the swing vote category but I don't think it will make much difference here in Texas but I will vote none the less.  Actually by being undecided I've stirred some controversy in my family, which I like to do every now and then. I have certain relatives who don't think you can be democrats and a Christian at the same time. (FYI I don't believe that and I am not a democrat)  I wish I had something else to write on other than the DNC.

      I feel so much relief now.&nbsp; I have completed all my assignments for my last class and I will graduate a week from Friday.&nbsp; In one sense I am so happy to be done but in another I am a bit sad about not being in school anymore.&nbsp; It has been such a transforming period of my life, actually it basically has been my life.&nbsp; Now I must step out of the academic world and step into the real world and I'm scared to death!

      This morning&nbsp; I decided to go to a local community church.&nbsp; It is a large church with about 1,000 in attendance at the service. &nbsp; Once I arrived I entered the building and proceeded to walk inside the worship center when something I spotted made me immediately think, 'Why in God's name is there a 20ft heigh and 8ft wide model of DNA?!'&nbsp; I thought surely there is going to be some kind of explanation.&nbsp; And there was.&nbsp; It had something to do with there are certain characteristics of God that are part of his DNA.&nbsp; Okay, sure that's fine but why have a huge model of it, is that suppose to be the size of God's DNA?&nbsp; Then I kept wondering what would be going through a person's mind who had never been to church when they saw this, thing.&nbsp; I wonder if they thought this is what we worshiped? &nbsp; I don't know, maybe it's just me but when I walk into church I prefer not seeing DNA the size of a dinosaur.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Here is a saying from a desert father about prayer   They asked abba Macarius, 'How should we pray?'  And the old man replied, 'There is no need to speak much in prayer; often stretch out your hands and say, "Lord, as you will and as you know, have mercy on me."  But if there is war in you soul, add, "Help me!" and becuase he knows what we need, he shows mercy on us.'

      I'm taking a course retroactive this summer and I was required to take a tour of a funeral home.  So, this morning I did.  I got to see everything except the prep room since their were bodies in there, so I understand why the director couldn't let me go in there.    The director's wife gave me the tour and when we were in the chapel she told me something she found interesting was where she was from most services were done at the church but here in this areas most services are done at the funeral home.  I too found this interesting.  I've been to services both at a funeral home and a church.  I guess it struck me is that why, if you have a home church, you would prefer the funeral home over the church.    I think it would great if one was baptized, born again, and then given a service once your died in the same place.  It's just a thought.

      I love random acts of kindness.  I love having a civilized debate with someone who thinks different than me.  I love seeing different people work together side by side.  I love my nephews, especially when one of them puts on 8 pairs of underwear.  I love niece.  I love it when people go out of their ways to help others who are in need.  I love watching the news and they find a child that has been missing for months and is reunited with their family.  I love books like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, that expand my brainsize, and those that just look good on my shelf.  I love movies that make me think, laugh or just give me mind numbing entertainment.  I love music from Bach, Dixie Chicks to Linkin Park.  I love taking a nap in the middle of the day during a thunderstand.  I love the fact the God can be loving, firm, powerful, confusing, frustrating and mysterious at the same time.  I love BBQ, Coca-Cola, Astros baseball (even though they aren't doing very good), playing sports, teaching kids, and animals.  I love to love better than to hate.

      I hate politics.  I hate that one party fights against the other just becuase they're the other party.  I hate that important issues like poverty get overlooked for issues over same sex marriage.  Yes you might think that is important but personally I don't think it is more important than feeding a starving child!    I hate Christians pushing stupid issues like prayer in school and hanging the ten commandments in the course room, and I hate liberals pushing the same thing.  I hate that people have to think it is one way or the other and if you don't see it my way well than you're an idiot.    I hate it when I see on the news another child has been abducted, abused in anyway, or murdered.  I hate people who don't use their blinker, speed, ride your bumper and play their bass too loud.  I hate having no money, AIDS, cancer, poverty, ignorance, olives, abuse, stupid people, and living at home.  This is my hate rant.

      Today, I went to my home church (only b/c we were leaving to watch a baseball game) and presented before me was a pretty patriotic service.  There were the church slash patriotic songs, they had a procession of the American Flag and the Christians Flag, and I'm pretty sure a patriotic sermon (but we missed that).  Basically all that was missing were the fireworks.  Don't get me wrong, I like being patriotic, but I don't like it at church.  It is more of a personal thing, I like to keep that stuff out of worship service.  To me it seems it should have been more sacred but I felt that line was crossed.  I just don't believe God only blesses America, I know that is probably not the intention of the song but in my experience the way it is presented it is.    So, yes I celebrate the fourth of July but not during the worship service becuase this time to celebrate, lament, kneel, and honor God not America.  FYI, the game was horrible, we got stomped.  Happy 4th of July.

      I'm trying to keep up my habit of reading and I want to vary the categories of reading material. The problem is there are so many topics or genres I want to read I can't decide. I want to read something historical, fiction-fantasy, literary classic, philosophical. I also do not know what is good and what is well lame so for the thousands of reader who read this could you give me a list of books you have enjoyed. I just need help getting a jump start here. Thanks a bunch.
