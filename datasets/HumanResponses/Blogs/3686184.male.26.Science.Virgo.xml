       Finally, I have found some time to write my first post. After the party last week (thanks all for coming, had a great time), I moved my stuff into storage and handled the last things before my departure. One thing I'd love we (humans) could do without is paperwork, but unfortunately there are a number of institutions and companies who like to make life miserable for everybody. Thank god, I have a lovely secretary. Well actually I was backed-up the last couple of weeks by a team of experts in equipment, paperwork, packing and moving (thanks mum, dad, bro, sis, Aukje, Kame and Dirk).   Well then, on Friday June 25th I was greated at the airport by a whole bunch of family and friends. I was rather suprised there were so many (Thanks for coming, you all). Some last minute presents made it an interesting task for me to see if I could keep my pack (10kg) with me in the plane. Fortunately it wasn't a problem. I checked in (a mere 29kg)and we went for a drink. At 15.30 I went through customs with my uncle Rene, who was going to London for the weekend. Unfortunately, we weren't flying the same airline to London. He dropped me of at the gate, and after a 30 min delay I flew of to London. Next to me sat an interesting Indian man and an English girl. At Heathrow, I had five hours to spare. I hung around and finally found a spot where I could watch the quarter-final between Greece and France, and what a game it was. Unfortunately I am unable to watch the matches here. I am wearing one of my orange shirts however for the game tonight (NL-Portugal) to at least support them in some way.   After 13 hours in the plane to Singapore, another 7 to Brisbane and loosing a day, I arrived in Brisbane. The Australian hospitality was noticable straight away when in contact with the various customs officers. I was through in no time and there I met Rod, my supervisor at UQ. He took me to his house, where I had a relaxing morning. In the afternoon I went with him and his wife to a party in his honour. He had just finished teaching to now focus on research. No alcohol for me because I could feel the jet-lag, real bad.   Monday and Tuesday I went to uni with him where we organised my final enrolment and other bureauratic issues. He drowned me during those days in information. In the end very helpful info. Yesterday I moved into Elisha's house (really nice place, though a little under-furnished).   More next time..... Keep checking and commenting!

       One week to go and counting. Tonight is Arne's farewell party before he's off next week to Australia. So if you are around, bring your own and join Arne at his flat in Utrecht.  Months of preparation, filling in forms, obtaining jabs, saying goodbye to friends, and packing in all those bits and bobs that make up your life will reach their conclusion next friday: off to Oz. Don't count on Arne staying there too long: before you know it, he's set up camp at yet another continent: South America. That's where most of his fieldwork will take place, in Peru. If you like to keep track of Arne's whereabouts and to find out what he's up to, check back here regularly.  You'll also be able to leave your own comments here to cheer him up and to let him know he's still in your mind although you are oceans apart. Hopefully Arne gets himself a digital camera soon to lard his texts with some lovely pics of his travels.  Arne, as you won't be able to carry too much stuff with you around the world, I hope this virtual diary is an apt present for you. Keep in contact dear friend!

       My stay at Elisa's place was great (thanks Elisa), a big house with jacuzzi for the two of us. Everyday I commuted to and from uni by citycat, i.e. a river-ferry, giving a beautiful view of Brisbane. Lunch I mostly shared with Marcio, a Brazilian PhD student, who showed me a couple of things around uni, like the Friday afternoon drinks at the staff restaurant/bar with a couple of people of the Earth Sciences department.   Saturday morning (Elisa and I couldn't sleep in, because we both were still suffering from jetlag - we were on the same flights from London to Brisbane without knowing this and eachother) Elisa showed me Brisbane centre..... well and that was an experience... A very short one, because we were done in 2 hours. It's a really small and quiet place, especially during weekends. To make life a little more interesting we joined two of her friends on Sunday on a hike in a national park, located a 100 km SW of Brisbane.   During the last week in Rod's office, I spent most of my time reading up, scanning articles and fragments of geological books... organising my enrolment and bankaccount. Wednesday night I enjoyed the 3rd Queensland-NSW rugby match of the year with Daniel and two others. The following day (my last day in Brisbane for a while) I spent packing and cleaning, and seeing Spiderman 2 with Elisa. The next morning off to the airport, destination Peru. Finally, South America, my first visit. But first...... the Oz-Peru trip.

       Is time-travel possible? A question asked by many of us..... Here's a trip back in time with me: Australia to Peru via Los Angeles, USA.   Brisbane was my port of departure on July 9th, 2004. It took me only 20 min by taxi from Elisa's place to the airport at the end of the morning peak hour traffic (I was really lucky, it normally takes up to 40-60 min around that time of the day). I checked in and cleared customs. Here I met an English guy who was travelling around the world and suprisingly was sitting next to me on the plane. He told me there was yet another stop-over before I got to Lima, which was Auckland, New Zealand. That is where he got off (I thought I was on the direct flight to LAX). After having travelled across many time zones, the dateline had to be overtaken to get to the States, which meant that I arrived in Los Angeles 30 min prior to my departure-time from Brisbane airport. Now YOU tell me if time-travel is not possible? Fortunately, my transit in the US went smooth even though I had the pain of having to clear customs, pick up my luggage and clear customs again (all within 3 hours and originally having my luggage labelled through to Lima). In the end, I travelled for 2 days from Brisbane - Australia to Lima - Peru via New Zealand and the US, and I only lost 1 day instead of 2.
