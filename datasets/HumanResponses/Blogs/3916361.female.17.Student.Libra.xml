      Just got back from the lake with my brother and Matt.&nbsp; We went to the lake at like 10 last night and ended up tubing while it was pitch black...Okay, so maybe that wasn't such a good idea, but it sure as hell was fun...And of course it just had to rain all night, so while we were on the boat, we were freezing our asses off.&nbsp; So, we set up our tent near some camp thingy and eat this huge bowl full of soupy stuff...Yeah, and Dan's water thing spilled sometime while we were on the boat, and we get up at like 4 and take the boat back to the marina so we can get to the "Rover" so we can find a gas station.&nbsp; It turns out that we turned the wrong way and thought that we were locked IN the camp--which is ridiculous--but anyways, so we go the nasty bathrooms they have because maybe they might have water fountains...THEY DO!...But....the damn water fountains don't have water!&nbsp;So we take the boat all the way back to our campsite and go back to sleep...We woke up around 12 and decided to take the boat out tubing before I had to leave because of work...So right now, the guys are screwing around and being the crazy guys that they are while I am getting ready for work...Awesome

      Nick called me Friday night and my phone was turned off.&nbsp; He left me a message, but his number didn't show up on my caller ID.&nbsp; I finally got his number and gave him a call today, but he's working right now...Maybe we'll do something later on tonight.&nbsp; I&nbsp;never did anything with Ryan because of work, but I'm not sure if&nbsp;I want to anymore, I mean I barely know him and I don't know how fun he is or whatever.&nbsp; I know with Nick I'll have fun though (he's so hilarious!).&nbsp; The one thing I like about&nbsp;him is that he smells really good...haha. Yeah I hate it when guys&nbsp;practically pour their cologne all over their bodies, and then the scent just overwhelms&nbsp;you so much that you can't even think, and you're&nbsp;choking and gasping for&nbsp;a breath of fresh air....Well, that's not&nbsp;Nick's case.&nbsp; He wears&nbsp;just the right amount and it smells really really good.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's so&nbsp;tall&nbsp;though.&nbsp; I am already short,&nbsp;but he honestly&nbsp;has to be like a foot taller than I am.&nbsp; Well, it'll be interesting to see how all this turns out.&nbsp; He seems like a really nice guy though...Just hope that I don't get tired of him...Which I doubt!

      I met Nick last night for the first time.&nbsp; He was cute,&nbsp;and he had a great personality (plus he has an awesome Jeep...JK).&nbsp; He supposedly already has my number and s/n so hopefully I'll be hearing from him again pretty soon! This morning I had to take my brother to work because something was wrong with his Land Rover, but he's finally supposed to be getting it back today.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;weird because I felt like I was his mom whenever I would have to take him places.&nbsp; Yeah what really sucks though is that I have to work tonight.&nbsp; I was supposed to be off and I had a date planned and everything.&nbsp; Have I mentioned that I hate my job? Because I really do.&nbsp; It sucks a huge one.&nbsp;A couple days ago my dad and I were talking about whether I should trade in the Tahoe for something else...He wants me to get one of those new Land Rover things...Like Freelander or something (I don't even know what they look like).&nbsp; But I really do like those new Range Rovers (haha, yeah right).&nbsp; I actually want a pink one.&nbsp; I'm listening to Dashboard Confessional--Ghost of a Good Thing.&nbsp; I like them, but after awhile, all their music sounds pretty much the same.&nbsp; If you're in a shitty mood, it's good music,&nbsp;but I'm in a happy mood so I think I will turn it off and&nbsp;blast some Britney!

      So last night at work wasn't too bad.  We weren't busy at all because of all the rain we've been having so it was nice just being able to stand around eating peanuts and knowing that you're getting paid for doing nothing. Tiff stayed at my house and we watched a few movies.  One of them was Thirteen.  That is one messed up movie.  It's about 2 thirteen yr. old girls who do drugs and drink and have sex...Yeah and the ending sucks! Well, I don't have any plans until tonight and Tiff is baby-sitting all day long. Maybe I'll give Brett a call...

      Last night after work I met Tiff, Jess, and Abby at Sonic. They had just come from practice. Apparently our team won't be very good this year.  I had a feeling that we wouldn't have very strong players, and the fact that Manny won't be coaching us this year isn't gonna help at all. Oh well, I guess I will just have to make the best of my senior season and just concentrate on getting my name out there for college coaches.
Well, tonight I have to work again.  I absolutely HATE my job! I thought I was getting paid yesterday, but it turns out that since I am "new" I don't get paid till next week! UUUGHHH!!! I'm really annoyed today about everything.  This morning I had to get up at 9 to go work out with Becky.  I was pretty much falling asleep while I was doing my thing.  And while I was doing--what seemed like--50 billion pounds on the leg press, Carlos (stupid-ass gay faggot who always has to put his fuck ass two cents in) was telling me that I wasn't doing it right, and that I was bending my knees too much, and how it should be easy for me because I was doing it wrong, when in reality, I was doing it just fucking FINE! AAhhhh...anyways...So I slammed down the weights and gave Jess a turn. But thank goodness that I am off of work tomorrow, and I don't have to work out either!  We have practice again, and I am actually excited about that because I get to see how our team plays...And I have a date after that (well after I shower of course).  You know, come to think of it...I have a date with another guy on Friday too. Man, I'll be busy...You know, I actually don't really want to have a boyfriend right now...It's just fun hanging out.

      Today I'm planning on walking/lying around all day in my PJs before I have to go into work at 5.  I've been working at Logan's Roadhouse for like 2 weeks now. I remember the first day that I started working: five minutes into the job I was already bored out of my mind.  It's the same crap over and over again. (1)You say "hello" to the costumers,(2) you ask them how many people they have and what their "smoking preference is", AND FINALLY,(3)you seat them. I complain now, but I don't think I'll be complaining once I pick up my first check.  I get $7.50 an hour just for completing those 3 simple steps for hours upon hours. Not Bad, Eh? But while I was talking to Landry yesterday, I realized why I get paid so much for such a simple job.  Dirty, old, and many times drunk men walk in and act like the hostesses are there for their perverted enjoyment.  While these crusty preverts are dreaming of taking us home, we have to stand there and take it.  If we go off on any of these men while they are grabbing our asses or pulling us closer into their stench infested bodies, we could get fired. Now, that's the part that sucks.  Okay, maybe that's a little exaggerated,and thank God it's lasts for only seconds (although it feels like a lifetime).  But after summer, I will probably quit and I'll be able to work for my dad, where any old men that hit on me there will be fired! It's nice how those roles can be switched...

      Yes, today I quit work! No more Logan's!!! Sure, I won't have that much money, but working sure as hell sucked ass. Summer is just about over for me.. :( I would have to say that this summer has been THE best summer ever. I really don't know why it has been great because nothing special has happened... I'm sad, but I don't mind starting school because it's my senior year! I had a pretty shitty year last year, so it's only fair for me to have an awesome time while I'm a senior, right? So about that Nick boy...Well, we just didn't have that "connection", so I called him last night and told him what was up. I felt bad because he's a really sweet guy and I didn't want to hurt his feelings, but he seems okay with it. So it's all good. Then there's Stuart. Now there's a funny kid. He goes to the same school as Nick and is even sorta friends with him. But that doesn't matter now does it? I think I'm starting to like him. The other night we talked till like 5 a.m., and I'm not even exaggerating... So we'll see how that goes...
