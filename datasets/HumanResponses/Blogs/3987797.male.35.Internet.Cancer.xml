        Surveillance footage from Washington's Dulles Airport on September 11, 2001 shows security personnel searching several of the hijackers who commandeered a plane and crashed it into the Pentagon later that day.     The newly-released video footage shows at least three of the five hijackers setting off metal detectors and being pulled aside and checked with hand-held detectors before being allowed to board the aircraft.     Authorities believe the men carried utility knives either personally or in their luggage.  The hijacked plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was flown into the Pentagon, killing all 64 people on board and 125 on the ground.     The attack came after al-Qaida members had flown two other planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City.

        The hits just keep on coming for Michael Eisner -- and not necessarily the good kind. The Disney chief executive, under fire for apparently driving away Steve Jobs's Pixar Animation unit, now has to watch his one-time studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg take dead aim at Disney's animation stronghold. Katzenberg, who in 1994 left Disney to form DreamWorks SKG with fellow moguls David Geffen and Steven Spielberg, will head DreamWorks soon-to-be spun-off animation unit, which filed its initial public offering on July 21.    The announcement that Katzenberg will head the publicly traded company is just DreamWorks' latest shot across Disney's -- and Eisner's -- bow. DreamWorks' Shrek 2, released in late May, has grossed more than $410 million at the U.S. box office, pretty much trampling prospects for Disney's animated Home on the Range, which has grossed a dismal $49 million. With its IPO, DreamWorks intends to raise $650 million, of which it says it will retain $175 million to make two computer-generated films a year.     Disney has said that it's gearing up its own animated-film unit to make computer-generated flicks, having determined that the market for traditionally hand-drawn films has begun to wane, but DreamWorks clearly has a headstart.       KEEPING PRIVATE. &nbsp; Insiders have been saying for months that an IPO was coming, in large part so that Katzenberg and his fellow moguls could reward employees who have largely worked without bonuses as the company has suffered intermittent dry spells with its live-action films and TV series. Even last year, DreamWorks' animated unit lost $189 million, the IPO says, as hand-drawn films Sinbad and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron flopped at the box office.     DreamWorks says it has six computer-generated films in various stages of development through 2006, including one that sources say is Shrek 3, slated to open Christmas, 2006. Later this year, it will release Shark Tale, which features the voices of Will Smith and Robert De Niro. DreamWorks has said it, too, will likely no longer produce hand-drawn movies.     DreamWorks officials declined to comment on the IPO, because they're in a quiet period. The IPO is expected to go to market sometime later this year. But filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission say Geffen and Katzenberg will both sit on the board, with Katzenberg acting as president and CEO. The chairman will be Roger A. Enrico, the former chairman of PepsiCo. Spielberg won't sit on the board or have the ability to designate a board member, according to the offering. Those with knowledge of the situation say the director opted out of a board seat, not wanting to make public the amount of money he receives for directing DreamWorks' films.       DISNEY'S BIND. &nbsp; Dreamworks' S-1 filing doesn't spell out exactly what Spielberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen would each receive from the spin-off, but it does indicate that Geffen and Katzenberg, who will have voting Class B shares that are worth 15 times Class A stock, would control the company. Spielberg is expected to receive an equal number of shares, but the filing doesn't spell out what type of shares. Microsoft&nbsp;co-founder Paul Allen, who owns a 24% stake in DreamWorks, will be issued special Class C stock that will give him a board seat, but his stock doesn't carry any more than a single vote per share.      What does this all mean for Disney, which now could face a well-financed competitor in DreamWorks as well as Pixar, which at last count had more than $740 million in cash, investments, and receivables on its own books? If Pixar walks, as its contract with Disney allows it to do sometime next year, Disney will be in a bit of a pickle. You have to think the folks in the Magic Kingdom are looking for some way to restore the animation franchise that once ruled the industry.

         I have been shown some Motherboard-compatibility-Charts with specs and model numbers of the upcoming Sempr0n-brand CPUs. We scribbled it down hastily and rushed back to the desk and made this comparison:        As you can see, Sempron’s frontsidebus is up 25% versus the lower XP-models which it is supposed to replace.     We leave it up to you to judge how much this accounts for increased performance. For the most careful conclusion, looking at the only Sempron model which clocks exactly as an XP-Model, the Sempron model number is 20% higher than the corresponding AthlonXP moniker.     We suppose AMD's spinners will come up with the explanation that these ratings are based on a scale based on some legacy reference-product, maybe like a Duron 1GHz. That’s fine with us, INQ regulars know well where these rating arrows aim for anyway. So we just leave it up to you to make your own mind up whether these numbers will hold their own against Celeron Ds.

       The foundations have been laid for upgrading the internet with an improved system for identifying computers around the globe.       A new identification technology has been built into a number of the internet's master, or "root" servers, which supply subsidiary servers, announced the US-based independent body that coordinates the internet's address system, the Los Angeles-based Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), on Wednesday.     "This is a big, big step," said Vinton Cerf, who designed the communications protocol that supports most internet traffic flow, called TCP/IP, and is now a member of ICANN's board of directors.  The internet uses a numerical system to identify computers connected around the world. Numerical addresses are mapped to names by domain name servers. For example, the domain name www.newscientist.com directs requests to computers with the Internet Protocol address 194.203.155.123, which identifies the computer hosting the site.&nbsp;        In-built encryption     There are 13 root domain name servers that hold the master records for all such address mappings. But the range of numbers used under the current system, Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), is slowly running out and about two thirds of the 4.3 billion numbers allocated have been used up so far. So a new set of rules, called IPv6, has been designed to take its place.       IPv6 will increase the number of numerical addresses massively, increasing capacity to 340 billion, billion, billion, billion numbers. This should allow for virtually any number of new computers or devices to be connected to the internet in the future. IPv6 will also introduce reliability and security enhancements.       Ben Laurie, a programmer who works on a number of internet software projects, says perhaps the most important aspect of IPv6 is that it includes in-built encryption. This will make it easier to make internet communications secure by from eavesdropping.         Significant gesture    "It will make it much easier to do end-to-end encryption," Laurie says. "So possibly the most important benefit will be for privacy."       Laurie adds that the change announced by ICANN will have little impact until other internet infrastructure including smaller domain name servers and other networking hardware is also changed. But he sees it is as a significant gesture.   "Having the root name servers signal that they think it's time this was done is a good thing," Laurie told New Scientist. "Certainly IPv4 will get exhausted eventually. It's already quite painful to use."  To achieve a smooth transition IPv6 has been designed to run in parallel with IPv4 and is expected to do so for around 20 years.

        Until roughly 7 months ago I considered myself a republican. During that time, I never took the time to educate myself to look, learn and listen&nbsp;on what was going on in our country, and world. I relied on what my friends and family (and certain media outlets) told me what was 'right and wrong' with the country and our so called enemies. Oh how I wish I could invent a time machine....    Recently I have had the privilege of meeting 2 people that have shown me what the real meaning of 'right from wrong' is. When I first met my friends, which was about 3 years ago, I stuck by my guns and argued my point about why we should send our troops into war and 'kick ass'. I was so hell-bent on capturing the bad guy at any cost, I would not stop and listen, nor look around and see what was going on. I don't consider myself a perfect person, but I am&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;educate myself about what is really going on in our society.    I had a long discussion with my brother and his wife tonight. We are an extremely close family and would do anything for each other (by the way I recently found out that&nbsp;I am an uncle&nbsp; ). We spoke about the economy, the war, taxes, human rights, GWbush and JFkerry. My brother was hard-nosed about many issues that myself and my sister-in-law were not. He believes that we should have a stronger presence in Iraq, and that GWbush has decreased the amount of government, as well as many other things. I refused to accept his viewpoints on most matters. I stated many facts and figures that I have recently researched and have learned from others; I gave him my heart-felt opinion on many topics that I strongly believe on how our government has done wrong; and generally tried to open him up to see the 'other side' of things. He is a tough nut to crack. But, he did agree on a&nbsp;few of points that I brought up. And those being:     What are we doing in Iraq? (He was for going to war, but he believes that Bush has taken it too far).    John Kerry may not be the best person to run our country, but he is the better of the two evils.     Things we did not agree on:     The patriot act    Media    Brands of beer :)    The voting process (this was a strong argument)    Economic class     That’s all I have to say, for now.     peace - love - music,  DJ At Work

      So I watched the Democratic National Convention last night on CSPAN.&nbsp; I know.. I know - I am a very exciting person - with a very important and exciting lifestyle.&nbsp; I have never watched any convention before.&nbsp; I am drawn, though,&nbsp;to the spoken words of those that may make America appear to be a more livable place.&nbsp; You move family to areas of town, or to other states because it may be more livable.&nbsp; When your whole damn country seems like a poor environment to raise your children... what do you do?&nbsp; expatriotism - I guess?&nbsp; What kind of environment is that?  I was really impressed with Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.&nbsp; I thought that their speeches were dramatic and hopeful.&nbsp; I, like Mr Lettermen, wish that their language was stronger.&nbsp; I am pissed about what has been done in my name.&nbsp; I want the Dems to stand and up and yell that we are not going to take it any more.&nbsp; Loud and Proud!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I think that the party is nearly as flawed as the 'other' party.&nbsp; Not the neo conservative money hungry fear mongers that are in complete control of our lives and many in the worlds lives now - but the Republican party.  I miss my family.&nbsp; I want it back.&nbsp; I want my family to grow up with me.&nbsp; And I want to grow uip with them.  for now....

      Any more articles about Theresa Heinz Kerry?  This one is heavy on praise but a bit low on substance.  She was republican in the 80's and apparently her views haven't changed much since then.  It seems like she does good things with her money...  I'd really like to know more about her.   urlLink AlterNet: In Praise of Unruly Women

         Pentagon Needs Billions More This Year in Iraq, Afghanistan   &nbsp;   The U.S. military has spent most of the $65 billion that Congress approved for fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and is scrambling to find $12.3 billion more from within the Defense Department to finance the wars through the end of the fiscal year, federal investigators said yesterday.     &nbsp;   The report from the Government Accountability Office, Congress's independent investigative arm, warned that the budget crunch is having an adverse impact on the military as it shifts resources to Iraq and away from training and maintenance in other parts of the world. The study -- the most detailed examination to date of the military's funding problems -- appears to contradict White House assurances that the services have enough money to get through the calendar year.     &nbsp;   Already, the GAO said, the services have deferred the repair of equipment used in Iraq, grounded some Air Force and Navy pilots, canceled training exercises, and delayed facility-restoration projects. The Air Force is straining to cover the cost of body armor for airmen in combat areas, night-vision gear and surveillance equipment, according to the report.     &nbsp;   The Army, which is overspending its budget by $10.2 billion for operations and maintenance, is asking the Marines and the Air Force to help cover the escalating costs of its logistics contract with Halliburton Co. But the Air Force is also exceeding its budget by $1.4 billion, while the Marines are coming up $500 million short. The Army is even having trouble paying the contractors guarding its garrisons outside the war zones, the report said.     &nbsp;   White House spokesman Trent Duffy said the Defense Department continues to believe that extra funds will not be needed this fiscal year. President Bush had requested a $25 billion reserve to cover shortfalls that may arise between Oct. 1, when the new fiscal year begins, and February, when the White House plans to submit a detailed funding request for military operations. But for now, Duffy said, there are no plans to tap the reserve. He added: "This president has said repeatedly the troops will have what they need, when they need it. That's why he has stood steadfastly in support of funding for our troops."     &nbsp;   Lt. Col. Rose-Ann Lynch, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon's comptroller, said that though the fiscal 2004 budget is tight, "the department still anticipates sufficient funding to finance ongoing operations."     &nbsp;   Democrats quickly pounced on the report, charging that the Bush administration is turning a blind eye to military funding issues to avoid adding to the overall budget deficit or conceding that the Iraq operations are off-course.     &nbsp;   "George W. Bush likes to call himself a wartime president, yet in his role as commander in chief, he has grossly mismanaged the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq," contended Mark Kitchens, national security spokesman for Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry. "He went to war without allies, without properly equipping our troops and without a plan to win the peace. Now we find he can't even manage a wartime budget."     &nbsp;   The GAO report detailed just why a $65 billion emergency appropriation has proved to be insufficient. When Bush requested that money, the Pentagon assumed that troop levels in Iraq would decline from 130,000 to 99,000 by Sept. 30, that a more peaceful Iraq would allow the use of more cost-effective but slower sea lifts to transport troops and equipment, and that troops rotating in would need fewer armored vehicles than the service members they replace.  Instead, troop levels will remain at 138,000 for the foreseeable future, the military is heavily dependent on costly airlifts and the Army's force has actually become more dependent on heavily armored vehicles. The weight of those vehicles, in turn, has contributed to higher-than-anticipated repair and maintenance costs. Higher troop levels have also pushed up the cost of the Pentagon's massive logistical contract with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root.  About 4,000 Navy personnel in Iraq and Kuwait were not expected to be there, contributing to a $931 million hole in the Navy's budget for fiscal 2004. The Marine Corps was supposed to have decreased its presence in Iraq but instead has 26,500 Marines in the country and an additional two expeditionary units supporting the war on terrorism.     &nbsp;   The strain is beginning to add up, the GAO said. The hard-hit Army faces a $5.3 billion shortfall in funds supporting deployed forces, a $2 billion budget deficit for the refurbishing of equipment used in Iraq and a $753 million deficit in its logistics contract. The Army also needs $800 million more to cover equipment maintenance costs and $650 million to pay contractors guarding garrisons.     &nbsp;   The Air Force has decreased flying hours for pilots, eliminated some training, slowed civilian hiring and curtailed "lower priority requirements such as travel, supplies and equipment," the report said.     &nbsp;   The Pentagon comptroller told GAO investigators that the Defense Department has sufficient funds to cover the shortfalls, provided Congress gives officials more authority to transfer money among accounts.     &nbsp;   But the GAO report warned that there will be a serious downside to that approach, especially the deferral of maintenance and refurbishing plans until next year.  "We believe that the deferral of these activities will add to the requirements that will need to be funded in fiscal year 2005 and potentially later years and could result in a 'bow wave' effect in future years," the report cautioned. "Activities that are deferred also run the risk of costing more in future years."     &nbsp;    A "bow wave" refers to a time when deferred costs confront Congress all at once, making it  impossible to meet the demands.         &nbsp;     urlLink © 2004 The Washington Post Company
