      When one is stuck home, on the computer, on a Saturday night, whistling "Oh Canada" (I kid you not), speaking in the third person, one knows they should really be more active in trying to get a decent social life.   I know Holly wanted to go dancing tonight, but I didn't have the car (I had previously okayed my brother with using it and I couldn't very well take it back). Plus Holly would just want to go to Port'O'Call to dance and I really cannot stand the place. Though at least that place is not Club Axis. That place of full of people with IDs faker then Pamela Anderson's bustline. I am turning into a boring old fuddy duddy. I don't even feel like drinking tonight (though after the other night I am due for a rest).  Finally started reading up on Australian politics again after the Mark Latham shock win in the Labor leadership race. Though I am extremly amused at the Australian Democrats Leader having to step aside after abusing the Liberal Whip. The ADs are dead. I cannot be happier. Hopefully the Australian Greens will become the minor party with the balance of power in the Australian Senate by winning most of the AD's seats that are up for election next year. At least one knows where they stand with the Greens like it or lump it, and not get the constant run around the ADs are famous for.   I really need to start buying my Christmas presents. I do not want to be one of these people in a big rush and tizzy on Christmas Eve trying to find the perfect present.  Heh. I just remembered that Lennie was suppose to call me yesterday to see if I wanted to go to the movies with him. He must be mad that I blew him off the Friday before hand (but if he saw how much I drank the night before (Thanksgiving) he would understand). I'll call him tomorrow to arrange another time. Then again, it may of been a blessing in disguise. I know he wanted to see "The Last Samurai", a movie I have no interest in period.   Talking about movies I want to see, I downloaded the trailer to "Alien vs Predator" last night. The trailor was sub-standard and nothing special, but the small featurette by the director looked very interesting. While I have never been a fan of crossing over franchises, I have to admit, as a huge fan of the "Alien" series (I think "Alien 3" is grossly under-rated), I do get a spine-tingling shiver of anticipation with the movie. Plus from the featurette, the movie is going to fill in ALOT of the backstory to the mythos.   Buh Humbug. I am going to find my "Coldplay" CD. I need some decent music in my head. Or I can just dig up that live cover of Nancy Sinatra's "You Only Live Twice" which I hace somewhere on this computer...

      I am really starting to distrust the meteorologistThere is just nothing like eating your dinner in front of the computer. Even better when one is eating Chinese food for that said dinner in front of the computer. I can feel the MSG flood threw my veins even as we speak. Mongolian Beef, Sweet & Sour Pork, Chow Mein & Fortune Cookies. Life cannot be sweeter (well until one has the cheesecake for desert, then life is the sweetest!)  Even though having dinner at 3:00pm MST does seem a little early even by my standards.  "Pirates of the Caribbean" is sitting on the coffee table waiting to be watched, I am not sure I care to see it. I have never been much of a Johnny Depp fan (though I do enjoy Geoffrey Rush & Keira Knightley). Maybe I will not watch it. I don't feel like DVDing tonight.  There was a Lobbyist Trainee session being run by the LWV and Sierra Club down in Sandy tonight. I did think about going, but Sandy is so far away for something I already have properly done before (these sessions are not that original) and frankly... Sandy scares me.  Oh, I really need to shave. But I hate shaving. But then again I hate growth on my face. Oh the conundrum...

      Today according to the Weather report last week was suppose to be chilly and snowing and just plan damp and miserable with various Arctic like blizzards making life difficult.  Yet when I woke up this morning, it was sunny, not a cloud in the deep blue sky and a mildly tepid 45F (6.4C) temperature. Bleeh... snake-oil science...   Then again, I did just check out KSL's weather forecast. It is suppose to remain in the mid 40s for the rest of the week and into next week. Woo-flipping-hoo. This time next week it will properly be fifty below.  I really should stop watching the weather reports. Then again, before last week, the last time I watched them was during the killer heatwave in July. I don't know why I even bothered to restart them. It isn’t like I have the active outdoor life to warrant watching them.  I did finally get the jogging in today, of course I was force to watch "In Living Colour" on television. Pity the treadmill is too huge to lug up the steps. Not that I mind "In Living Colour", but I have seen that episode several times already. I much prefer to jog to "Cybil" but I don't seem to get up early enough these days to catch it on Oxygen in time. At least I wasn't jogging to "Xena: Warrior Princess" today, the episode was the infamous "Lyre Lyre, Hearts on Fire". To hear Draco sing "Always Something there to Remind Me" was particular grating (and what’s more, Jay Laga'aia has a great singing voice, which makes it even worse).  Oh well life cannot be all fun and games watching bad women's television. But then again life is pretty ordinary at the moment. I have figured out what to get Jill for Christmas though - a potato peeler... a fun little private joke.   Now I just have to figure out what to get Claudia, Laurie, Sheryl, Lindsay & Amin (dear lord I really need more male friends). And that is not even starting with my family!!! Argh!!! No wonder I am always broke! Darn tooting holidays!  At least I can seek my revenge soon enough... my birthday... tee hee hee  I have finally decided where to get my next tattoo - the armband. It'll be on my right shoulder instead of below my current tattoo on my left shoulder. Since my current tattoo is Chinese symbols, having an armband below it is just to Sporty Spice for my taste... Now I just have to figure out the design.   And money obviously.

      Is it completely wrong of me to be excited about going to see the Mormon Tabernacle Choir? Cause frankly I am. It is like the second most famous choir in the world (I will grant the Vienna Boy's Choir is more famous). Actually I wouldn't mind seeing the VBC either, but I am not flying all the way to Austria.   But the spirit of Christmas has finally hit me, and I am stark raving seasonally mad. I am alternating humming between "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" (My second favorite carol - and this is the kick ass Sarah McLachlan & Barenaked Ladies version) and "The Battle hymn of the Republic". Yeah I know the latter is not a Christmas Carol. But bite me. It is hummable and uplifting.  It was so foggy outside today that driving was quiet scary. Whats more, you can see the fog literally in front of you as a wall, one side it was nice and sunny, the otherside... it was the wall... and you could do nothing but drive into it.  Well I am going into Salt Lake City tomorrow. And I cannot wait. Hopefully I get to see "Return Of the King", get to see Jill and give her the potato peeler I got her for Christmas, eat some Sushi and see some lights and hear some music.  Oh and if beer is to be found anywhere in between those activities, I will not be saying no.

      Finally did another major chunk of my Christmas Shopping today. And got the major presents for both my brother and my sister out of the road. My brother was quiet easy to shop for suprisingly. I was told he wanted slippers, as I just got him a pair. Easy. My sister on the other hand was an absolute menace to shop for. I refuse to get her smelly stuff like perfume, soaps or make-up (if she wants it do damn much, she knows the way to the mall), so I was in a bit of a panic. I even thought for a while about getting her a lava lamp or a faux Tiffany lamp, which I saw for pretty decent prices at the store, but I chickened out. In the end I got her a new wallet and socks. Yes sock. I think socks are under-rated.  Well hopefully I am going skiing tommorrow. Unforunately I need to get up early to go. I don't want to get up early. I have not had a full eight hours sleep for a week and it is starting to effect me.  Still, I could just say no, but I will not. I actually want to go skiing. Even with my wide feet.  Yep, wide feet. I know the manufactures of the ski boots always say to get a ski boot the same size as your normal shoes, but I cannot even get my foot into a 10 1/2 ski boot (which corresponds to my shoe size). I have to go for a size 13 1/2 just to not cut of the circulation in my feet! Argh!

      I swear I am turning into Garfield. This week I have done nothing but sleep and eat (abietly it is only Tuesday).  I had to cancel with Lennie to see "Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King" on Friday since I will be doing my defensive driving driving that day. I couldn't get any other time before Christmas, and I want this course to be over and done with by the last day of Christmas or there will by no maids'a'leaping or geese'a'laying for me.

      I finally purchased the RAM upgrade thingy for my Computer. Well I didn't purchase it by myself. I had to get my fathers help in figuring about which specific RAM thingy I neede. Obviously since I am calling it "thingy" shows my complete lack on knowledge as to watch goes on inside a computer. For all I know "TRON" could be taking place inside of a computer. Well hopefully "TRON" has upgraded itself at least to a "ReBoot" level if it is taking place inside my computer.  I use to love "Reboot" it was the perfect Saturday morning cartoon series. Though heck if it doesn't look old and antiquated these days!!!   But hopefully once the RAM thingy arrives in the mail, I can finally do some serious damage on the computer.  Well tomorrrow is looking like it will be an exciting day. I am going down into Salt Lake for the first time since two Thursdays ago. It is the longest I have not been down their in a long long time.  Having breakfast with all the old crew will be majorly cool. Especially with Laurie presenting the often mention by never seen scrapbooks to Rocky. Those scrapbooks have become legendary. Laurie has even joked that she has spent so much time on them she wants visitation rights!   I think I am going to ring up Kimmy, back in Melbourne. I hope she is home. It is the right time...   ...why the heck not.

      Well with a thread title like this, one can easily guess what movie series I am watching at the moment.   Well I went to bed really early last night as I was completely exhausted after a hard day out on the town Christmas shopping and looking at scrapbooks. Laurie's scrapbooks for Rocky where wonderful. FIVE volumns. And they looked professionally down. They where absolutely beautiful.   Except the horrid pictures of me in it. I wonder if Laurie purposely went out and found the worst photos of me and put them in the scrapbook. Lets see. I did like the photo of Laurie & myself at the Salt Lake Stingers 4th of July baseball game. But the photo of me reading "Catalyst Magazine" on the couch was bad, and lets not even go into the photo of Rocky & myself. I looked like I had no teeth!!!   Though she did put in my favorite photo. The one of me at the Manhattan Club against the fake New York Skyline. Puffing a Cigar in my right hand and a glass of Merlot in the Left Hand. Then again I drank so much Merlot that night, it isn't funny.   Afterwards I went Christmas Shopping. Or at least that is what I set out to do. I ended up buying nothing for those who I was meant to buy for, but when I saw a copy of the 1978 "BattleStar Gallatica" telemovie at "Borders" for $14.95, I knew I had to buy it for my mother, since she loved the movie. Unfortunately my mother is the one person whos present I already have. Ack!   Well since I was that tired, I went to bed after "The Simpsons". And that isn't good. I know I have a rule of not going to bed before 9:00pm because it would just mean I would get up to early.   Which I did. I went to bed at 7:30PM and woke up at 1:00AM. And what is worse, I woke up with a killer headache. Well I will spare the grusome details, but lets say it wasn't pretty (and I couldn't find any pain-relievers).  I finally started to feel better around 5:00am and went back to sleep.   Luckily I had nothing on today but the defensive driving course, so I was able to sleep in a bit. But I still have felt groggy all ickky all day.  This has not been that great of a day really.

      It is odd how somebody can have an entire new lease on life with one simple haircut. I woke up this morning for a 9:30am appointment with Missy only to discover after having a shower and getting dressed that my travel alarm-clock (which I used since my normal alarm clock has been acting up lately) was still on daylight saving time! It was only 8:30am. And my four hour sleep deprived mind could of had an extra hour of sleep on the house!  I was so PO'd with myself. But thankfully it all changed once I got to the hairdressers.   Missy was as usual, absolutely wonderful. Plus she did a nice job on my hair. I just feel so dirty having the hots for a married women. Oh why oh why! She was extra cute as well today wearing a new pair of glasses. Then again even before Missy got married in the summer she proberly wouldn't of dated me, since she is a good Mormon girl, and I am... well... a gentile...   Then again, I need to stop looking backwards and start looking forwards. While Holly is "technically" Mormon (ie - in name only), she is very open-minded and a fun great person (though she did admit to pulling off an Academy Awarding Winning performance to get into BYU Hawai'i - only to choose to leave it 6 months later). Then again, who wouldn't want to have a cheap tertiary education in Hawai'i!  I popped by Albertson's to pick up Jill's Christmas present - a new potato peeler!  But anyway, with my new haircut I had a new lease on life. With that lease I went back to bed until 4pm (And I had some trippy dream involving Big Bird trying to find his long-lost daughter - even though Big Bird is actually a "she"). But after waking up (one bad thing about that being I will never get to sleep tonight), I got ready for the Red Lobster Christmas Party.  The food was only so-so, but the atmosphere was fantastic. Still the night was great, and I got to be camera-nazi. I love being camera-nazi and taking all the photos and forcing everybody to smile, yet not having a single photograph of me taken - even with my new haircut.  Tee Hee Hee.

      Well Holly couldn't make it. Darn Lindsay had to go and get better! So with no Holly and no Jill/sushi tonight, I went and started the defensive driving course I have been planning to do for a long time. Yee Gods... I know they played videos from 1972 in normal Drivers Education, but the videos they played tonight where flabagasting. A Disney sancioned Goofy Short?!?!  Is it just me or these driving schools playing it by ear instead of actually having a proper thought out process for these lessons, the lady was nice and all, but she spent half the time on her phone and we marked our own theory tests!  What one does for lower insurance...  I cheated on my diet today. I am a bad boy. A bad bad boy. I ate two Tim-Tams my Grandmother sent over and a whole bunch of preztels. I don't even like preztels, but when I diet, I crave them!!!  I need to ring her up. I have not spoken to her in a while, plus I really want her to send me one of those Northern Rivers Calanders for me like she did for my dad last year. Knowning all the landmarks around Ballina and having them on a calander in your office is a pretty cool idea.  Paid my phone bill today. Bleeh... I am going to just fork over the $15 bucks and get the lower-rate plan my phone comany is advertising at the moment.  The good news is the wireless connections came via FedEx today! I know can use my own computer in my room for the internet instead of this tired old thing I am using at the moment. Well I am defraging it at the moment... so may I can use it tomorrow.  I cannot wait until tomorrow! Red Lobster!!!

      Absolutely one of the most non-interesting days of my life.  Jogged 7.2kms (4.5 miles)  Defensive Driving lesson - Wet weather stuff. Video Sponsered by Goodyear Tires. Bleeh. At least it was made in 1992 and not 1972. Though Scott Bakula in his "Quantum Leap" persona was quaint to watch.  "Anne of Green Gables: The Sequal" (aka "Anne of Avonlea") is playing on KBYU as a part of their never-ending telefone. I want to visit Prince Edward Island now.

      I cannot believe I have been invited to THREE different Christmas functions this Thursday. Two of them where invitations today. Holly wanted to go out and see the Christmas lights (finally she rang me up to reschedule)... it pained me to tell her I already had plans on Thursday. She said she'll ring me back to see if she can do tomorrow instead. She originally had plans with Lindsey tomorrow night, but Lindz has been sick, so she might have to cancel.   Then Claudia rang me up asking if I wanted to come to an impromtue little mexican fiesta Christmas Party she was throwing!!! Argh!!! I want to go to them all!!! But I am going to be up north in Layton for a Christmas Party I booked a month ago for the Davis Dems at the local "Red Lobster" (actually that isn't that bad since I love "Red Lobster") Apart from the fact I have already forked over the money for the event, I have already promised to be the offical photographer for the event (note to self... remember to buy film).  I have had so many phone calls today it isn't funny. I have not had as many in the last two weeks that I have had today. I missed four of them outright. One was Jill saying she'll have to cancel our regular Wednesday sushi-dinner tomorrow due to a Christmas Party she has to attend (See! Again! Christmas parties are EEEEEEEEEVIL!).  Well since Jill cancelled tomorrow night hopefully that means I can meet with Holly now (actually It was still do-able before, since I would of been done with the Sushi dinner before I met up with Holly), but now it means there is no excuses on my own behalf. Hopefully Lindz is still sick and thus cancells on Holly.   Okay, that was really really mean of me to hope that Lindz (who is arguably my best-friend) will still be sick. But I REALLY REALLY want to see Holly again!!! Argh! Conflict! Conflict! Will Robinson! Conflict!  On the plus side I did 8kms (5 miles) on the tread-mill today. Nothing interesting was on tele while I was jogging and ended up watching some MTV reality junk (A year in the life of a Cheer Squad) *gag*

      It snowed today (well actually it snowed in the early hours of this morning) and everywhere is looking like a winter wonderland. It is amazing how snow can turn the ugliest most unattractive things into beautiful pieces of white art. I guess that is the major benefit of snow - for it doesn't really have any other redeaming qualities. It is too wet, too cold and is more hassle then it is worth otherwise.  I had weird dreams last night. I seem to have the wierd dreams when I sleep in and end up sleeping for 10-12 hours. If I sleep the normal 8 hours I tend to avoid any of the surreal stuff that plagues my head otherwise.   Well I am offically counting calories again. I did 6.4kms (4 miles) today on the tread-mill (I ended up watching the latest version of "The Real World-Road Rules Challenge") The producers love to think about more cruel and unusual ways to torture the contestants - not that I don't get a secret satification out of seeing America's most beautiful (and dumb) people get battered, bruised and crying like a schoolgirl.   Reality TV is almost as bad as Lifetime & Oxygen. Though it passes the time when jogging. It's isn't like I am going to be grabbing my crotch and watching SpikeTV anytime soon.  I better get darn well into shape. I should start up with the pilates again. Though it is incredibly boring when one does it alone. It definately is a social exercise.  I really need to find myself a life. I cannot go on with all this sleeping and eating. I cannot turn into Garfield (and since I am watching what I eat now, it makes what little enjoyment the comes with being Garfield disappear). Hopefully this staffing offer comes through. I know Donald is the guy that keeps his promises (and a really nice person to boot) and thus I have the position regardless... but still I will fret and will not be satisfied until I am dressing up in a suit and tie again.  Well the one good news is I will proberly be doing the California trip after Christmas (abietly avec family, sans friends). Well then again I am saving up for my own trip to Los Angeles next year (though after last years problems, it is definately goint to be sans Tim (to whome I have not spoken to since then - well there was the phonecall he made to me asking where to drop off the book I left in his car - but that doesn't count), so I guess I should be grateful I am getting a free holiday out of this and not spending my own money (much of it anyway). The scary thing is this is going to be the first time I have been at sea level in 2 years (actually 23 months, but who's counting).

      Well I had my first ale last night. I went to The Bayou down on State Street with Lindsey and Blythe. It was a Belgium import. Chimay I believe it was. Wasn't particularly impressed with it. Rather sweet really. I'd rather just drink champaign then drink a beer that tastes like champaign. Abietly it still didn't stop me drinking it. It did go down. All five bottles I had went down pretty well.   Still all in all, if that is what all ales taste like, I think I am just going to stick with the lagers. I don't need sweet beer. It is just not right.  Then again the highlight of the night was definitely the sweet potato fries that where on the menu. Talk about yummy! I really should make some of my own. I really love sweet potato. Though I cannot confess to completely understanding the American obsession of mixing mashed sweet potato with marshmallows. Not appealing...   I got a weird phone message this morning. I didn't have my phone on last night, but when I turned it on this morning, there was a voice message on it from 2.55AM. I listended to it, and was rather shocked. It was one of my friends and his girlfriend, and they where... doing something naughty... From the sound of it they mustn't of realized they had rung the phone and that I'd get an earful of... their role-playing game...  Dear lord, if it wasn't for the fact I have this message on my Voice Mail machine I wouldn't believe it. Though how am I going to approach my friends about this... tell them a paddle is better? Dear lord, what a quagmire...  There is a production of "Oklahoma" on the television at the moment. I wonder if it is the Hugh Jackman West End version. Either way, I am going to go watch it.

      What can I say, I watched "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl", and as much as I tried not liking it, I have to admit I really really did enjoyed the movie.  I know it has been said before (and I will say it again), that a movie based on the lamest, most boring ride at Disneyland (which I didn't particular care for myself - I want roller coasters not spinning teacups!) would actually turn out to be extremely entertaining and top notch.  I think the successful formula that made it work was that the people in charge made the movie for entertainment value alone - they had a gay old time so to speak. BUT the catch was they still in the end make a decent movie by not going overboard and camping it up. (ala "Batman & Robin").   We have all viewed those movies that had the formula of "It is a fun movie, not a serious one, so laugh dammit", but those movies still stink worse then a Slaughterhouse - in Florida - in July. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact magic formula they used that combined the two elements of "fun" and "good" together so well, but hey, they need to bottle that formula (and then sell it to Adam Sandler - PLEASE GOD give him a CLUE!!!)  Keira Knightly definitely is the breakout star of the movie, she provided life to what was a cliche paper-thin character and turned her into a corset wearing Xena for the 18th century (well a whalebone wearing corset anyway - we have all seen the leather one).  She is beautiful AND she has the talent and the gumption to become the next English Rose (move over Jane Seymour, shoo Kate Winslet). There is just so much to rave about her, but so little hours left in the evening to do so. She has the charisma to really carry a movie like this in her own right.  Orlando Bloom was fair enough, but he did come across as a weak link and just another pretty face (even though ironically his character was central to the plot). I guess they needed some Orlando 'ying' to Kiera's 'yang' (or would it be the other way around?)   Admittedly it was rather fun trying to spot his Elvish tattoo on his wrist. Even though they kept covering it up throughout the movie, it did appear at least partially in various scenes - like the original sword fight in the Black Smiths.  And okay... Johnny Depp. What can I say? He was amazing as Jack Sparrow. I guess I need to take back most of my pre-conceived notions of him. He isn't necessarily the dark brooding anti-hero that only ever plays characters more depressed and miserable then himself.  Pity he hasn't played more fun and light-hearted characters, he is really good at this particular style. Hopefully we will get to see more like this out of him. Heck, we know we will... he signed up for the sequel!!!   The only negative was the ending where I felt that Elizabeth and Will should’ve jumped into the water after Jack and went on with him living the pirate lifestyle. The ending given was a little to Disney-esque for me (I kept expecting Mickey and Donald to pop out and shake the Governors hand). But oh well, cannot win them all...   Maybe I should have seen this on the big screen; I definitely did miss out on seeing something spectacular. Cause everybody was a little boy (or girl) once, and what little boy (or girl) didn't at some stage want to be a pirate sailing the high seas chasing Spanish Galleon?

      I am not in a pleasant mood at all at the moment. I am so mad. I am steaming. It is 4.18 AM in the morning and I cannot sleep due to this pent up twisted anger that is in me.  I will not into details what it is (the rants and the vents need to be verbal, it doesn't work well when translated into text), but I discovered more or less I was seriously gipped, screwed over, fucked over, you name it, with something that occured in 2002. Now the reason I didn't realise it then because being the good-natured trusting person I accepted the circumstances at face value (and what people told me) and didn't investigate further. But today, almost by complete accident I discovered it was not the case.  Should I be so frustrated and angry at something that occured 15 months ago? It has to do with money, mainly money which I should of gotten for services rendered, but didn't.  Adam saw how pissed I was and God bless his soul, he made me an extra big martini for the little martinis on friday bash we where having. Still I would of needed alot of martinis to really dull the edge.  And sadly this day was going so well up to it. I had coffee with Frank (well he had coffee, I don't drink the vile stuff) and we swapped birthday presents (even though both our birthdays where well over a month ago). He have me the book "Wicked" and I gave him the "Adrian Mole Diaries" (one of my favorite books ever) plus a National Geographic from December 1978 (the month he was born in).  Plus I brought a couple of CDs today for the first time in so long. I got the new Bangles CD (It's my thing... deal with it... hee hee) and the original cast recording for "Into The Woods" (the Vanessa Williams version, not the Bernadette Peters version).  The Bangles new CD was a disapointment, but I am really enjoying "Into The Woods".

      I went to my bank today to put some money in my account. Nothing special. You see I have a subscription to a glossy rather superficial entertainment magazine. Something I read on the bus, that doesn't waste to many brain cells.  Now I checked both at the online customer service page they have on their internet site as well as the little white box in the bottom right corner of the magazine. BOTH say my renewal wasn't until tomorrow, the 30th of January. So I went into the bank today to deposit the money for the renewal only to realise that the withdrew the money YESTERDAY. Bleeping Yesterday!!! Of course this sent my account into the red and I got slugged with an over-draft fine that was more then the magazine freaking subscription!!!  I am so mad, madder then heck.   I have to admit the bank teller was really sympathetic, saying nice stuff like it happens to the best of us, and he even gave me a complementary ice scraper with my bank logo on it. I have to begrudge the fact my bank is pretty much innocent (even though they did slug me with the overdraft fine). The bank teller even helped me fill out a over-draft protection form so I am saved from this in the future.  But still... as a famous Yellow Pages ad goes...  NOT HAPPY JAN!!!  I will be calling up the magazine customer service line tommorrow to express my disgust. I will be planning to scare several innocent Indians who are maning the customer service center in New Delhi. I also plan to use several four-letter words. The bad ones to boot.

      I have to return my iPAQ. The stupid freaking thing is having allignment problems. At least it has a warrenty. Though I wish my father wouldn't be so cheap and always get the one at the cheapest price, cause they tend to always be the dodgy ones. I know it was a birthday present and I shouldn't complain, but frankly at this stage I am willing to shell up the extra $20 just to get a new one from Staples or OfficeMax.  Last night was great. There are so many stories I wish I could tell, but my high standing in polite society means I cannot. I wish I drank more considering all the grog was free, but I just didn't feel like drinking. I really was a teetertoller mood. Damn me. Damn me to the worm at the bottom of the bottle.  People were constantly commenting how well I scrub up (in a tux), which I found incredibly annoying. I pride myself on my apperance for the most part. Yes, I have the days where I really just roll out of bed without changing my clothes, but 99% of the time, I make sure I am well dressed weather it be professionally or personally. I guess there where trying to make small talk.

      The tux fits like a dream. Damn. It was worthy every bloody penny (and it cost alot of pennys mind you). The cuffs and cuff links feel a bit odd, but otherwise I like it. Damn I felt like a million bucks in it. I wonder what Holly will be wearing tonight. I bet she will be as gorgeous as usual. If I don't end up drunk and hitting on her, the tux is going back to the shop! What is the point of spending all that bloody money if I don't get something in return? And Hols is bloody well worth it *evil grin*

      I hate having a life. I have not updated in a long time since my busy life is taking me away from the net. Heck the only reason I am able to update now is because I don't need to go to work until late (I have to get my final fitting for my Tux tomorrow at 2pm and thus don't need to go into work until after that is done - though one down side - real late night catching up).   Well the Ball in on Saturday, now in the wee hours of today, it is tomorrow. And going to get the fitting of the tux is now today.  I have eaten nothing in the past two days except for chinese food and candy. I need to get something slightly more healthy in my tummy soon. And I thought I was going to look so good for the ball.  Admittedly I feel like Cinderella going to the ball at the moment. I hope my own "Princess" Charming will be there.  Got my hair cut today again. I don't particular care for it, well I shouldn't say that, since it is what I got for the last several times and Missy just went right into it without asking. I should of mentioned I want it shorter then usual. I hate long hair. I consider one inch to be hippy.  My birthday was bloody excellent though. My parents got me a PDA. An iPAQ. Bloody thing isn't complete working for me though. I cannot get allignment working even though I make sure the stylis its the targets dead on in the allignment tests. Grrr... argh... I might have to return it to the manufactures and swap it. I don't really want to do it, but I might have to.  The birthday drinks where really good. I had a blast and the people that showed up. The coolest. I cannot believe Joel thought I was only 23. He deserves to die! I lived an entire year at 23, I don't want to be it again!!!  A funny scene happened today when Arlyn introduced his boyfriend at work. Everybody at first thought Chris was a Cougar. That would of been a sign of the apcolypse since Arlyn is such a huge Utes fan. He threatened to boycott Office Max since they had only Cougar calanders on display!

      I love to be busy and work. Call me wierd, but I tend to be the happiest when I am slightly stressed out with a little to much work and my mind is focused. Of course stress helps one thing clearer (at least in its true sense... these days humans tend to manipulate the word alot to mean things that it isn't), thus thinking clearer helps one to remain focused.  Back in the days of the caveman, stress was a survival function. If for example, the caveman was jumped by a saber-tooth tiger, stress would kick in. It is fight or flight. Sudden split second thinking is needed. Thus stress shuts down non-essential drives (digestion, sex drive), increases blood flow and oxygen intake through the lungs, which in turn pumps more oxygen to the brain and helps you think better.  Physiologically, the hypothalamus gland responses to the attack by sending a signal to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends down to adrenal gland to pump the blood with adrenaline. Which set off the whole heart/lung shebang which I have already mentioned.  You know, I learnt this in my Physiology class at university many eons ago. I hated the subject, but I adored my professor Dr. Toop. She was an absolute gem to have as a professor and I wish I had more interest in that subject, but at the time my interest in the biological sciences had wained completely and I was only doing it for the credit points and cutting up the toads.  I don't remember anything else from this class except this (and oddly how the Tyroid Gland operates).  Bah Humbug. Theoretical Sciences are much better. Physics rules. I just hated the fact my University dropped the entire major before I could undertake it. If I was able to do it, I properly would be more into science today then more current passion/job.  But anyway, stress biologically only is a function used for one of two answers "fight or flight" (In this case I choose to fight the workload... tee hee hee). The way it has been manipulated in todays society (oh lordy me, my boyfriend forgot my birthday, I am stressed... that darn person stole my carpark, I am stressed) is really rather said and shows one of the pits that exist in modern society. People have taken a natural survival function and turned it into some type of chronic disease. Typical bloody humans.  But apart from that, I really did enjoy digging my teeth into todays workload. The entire project is coming along nicely. Plus todays tasks properly are the most repetitive I will have to worry about, thus I have all new exciting and wonderful non-repetitive things to look forward to.  Nothing stressful about that.

      It is going to be difficult to refer to 2003 as 'last year' now. I guess I will have to get use to it (again - since this happens every year and I guess every year, every man and his dog mentions it will be difficult to refer to last year as last year).  I went ice skating for the very first time and I loved it. Admittedly I would of enjoyed it more if the skates where not one size two big (they didn't have size 11, only size 12 - actually I am a size 10, but they don't have half sizes and once you compensate for my wide feet and the thin skates, I am a 11). Plus I didn't have my kene braces, so I was properly a little to overly-cautious. Saying that I hope to do it again soon!  Well the fireworks on New Years Eve where pretty pathetic, so I guess at least in Utah, the only two big firework days are Independence Day on the 4th of July and Pioneer Day on the 24th of July. New Years Eve mustn't be anything special.  Then again I was up at Jill's house in the Upper Avenues overlooking the valley. It was fun to watch the fireworks go off, even if they where bad and the few crackers to go off in and around the neighbourhood (even though it is completely illegal to do it on the hillside in case of fires). But what was the cool thing was that Jill's house being high up on the hill overlooks the valley, right down to the mountains at the very end at 12000 South in Draper. And thus I could see lots of fireworks go off all over the Valley, I saw some go off in Sugarhouse, Murray, South Salt Lake and some places over on the westside. Heck I even saw little blobs of light on the edge of vision which must of been right down at the very end of the Valley around Sandy and Draper.  I think I offended Jill though since I refused to crash on her couch even though it would of been more logical for me to do so then go home. But ever since I met her son David and he... well didn't like me... I find it hard to just crash. The thing is Jill is just a good friend who I met through work. Yeah she is 53 with a kid (David) my age, but she acts like she is in her 20s. She is the coolest. Plus I sort of still owe her from when she took care of me during the summer when I had that dreadful case of food poisoning at the Jazz Festival (oh the bad memories of that night... first of all, even without the food poisoning which hit me during the Evening Jazz Concert, the fact was the music was BAD, not real jazz at all, but that world music crap).  I brought myself a new organiser which I have to say is seriously adult and mature. I love it. I needed a new one since my old one (not that I ever used it - it still had 1996/1997 inserts in it - I don't know what my Aunt and Uncle thought when they gave it to me when I was 16) was useless. As nice as the old orgainser was, its ring binder and holes where totally a different spacing that no inserts catered for.   The Organiser is brown leather (don't ask me why, but I totally dug the Brown - maybe I was a UPS driver in a past life) and totally cool in every way. I am still a little miffed that I had to fork over so much money for stupid insert refills (none of the orgainisers came with the day-a-page inserts, only week-a-page at best. To pay $20-$30 a refill is highway robbery!!!  I know I should really invest in a palm pilot and leave the Organiser to go the way of the dinosaurs, but while I wouldn't mind a palm pilot, I have to say there is something I just love about the smell of paper and leather and actually physically imprinting the tasks from pen to paper. I swear I can remember the event better if I actually handwrite it instead of typing it into some computer/palm pilot.  But I need an orgainser with the new work I have, my old brain couldn't keep up with my tasks anymore. I am really getting old... ode for the days of my lost youth...  But I am glad to be back at work. I am loving it. I am working on Event Planning and I am suprisingly really good at it. I never really done it before. I mean I may of helped out here and there for the odd event on the evening in question, but know producing an event from the very beginning and getting all the right people place and making sure it all goes right... it is so great!  And whats more this is the perfect stepping stone into what I really want to go into.  Well today was a lazy Saturday at home all things considered. I should of really down some jogging on the treadmill, but I really was not in the mood for it at all. Today and yesterday have been really robin's egg blue sky. It has been absolutely beautiful (even if it is still as cold as a nun's... errr.... refridgerator). Veiwing Antelope Island from my house of great. Seeing the white snow covered hills of Antelope island against the sky and the lake - no that there is much water in the lake, but hopefully the recent influx of snow can compensate for it). Snow is an amazing thing, making everything look so beautiful, even a ordinary ugly dirt hill like Antelope Island.

      First of all I hate snowboarding. After yesterday I hate it with a passion. It is evil. It is not just evil. It is the Vanilla Coke of Evil. Whoever came up with the grand idea of strapping two feet together on a piece of over glorified plastic sould be tortured by having a pack of hungry chihuahua eat him.  Standing at top of a steep hill (which was the Bunny slope of all things) with both feet straped to the board and you are standing sideways is not funny. I could not balance myself and seriously had the worst time. I fell down, flipped over, flopped, twisted and shmeis myself. I am not battered, bruised and really stiff. Seriously my muscles are so stiff that I could bounce coins off them. At least bruising gives your visual comfirmation of your prediciment, but this stiffness and soreness is even worse.  Hell on earth. And it was Frozen Over to boot.   Hmmm... Ironic that hell is in Utah?  The thing is I am a good skiier, I enjoy skiing alot, but snowboarding just doesn't agree with me. I guess I need duel control. Left foot control and right foot control.  Never again.  Christmas was good though. I finished all my Christmas shopping on the 23rd by buying everybody multiple pairs of socks to go as little gifts with their main gifts. I think socks are grossly under-rated.  Christmas lunch was fabulous, it was nice to have seafood again. All one needs is to up the temperature to at least 25C/77F and it will start feeling like a real Christmas again. Snow outside at Christmas is just not right.  Though I did get rather carried away with the Christmas Spirit in the end. But who cares. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir's Christmas CD was a real good listen.  I did get to see "Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King" at the Gateway on Christmas Eve. I am in love all over again. If Éowyn came knocking at my front door... well I don't need to fill in the blanks. And I loved the score. I have to buy the score now. The score owns me. Especially the piece called "The White Tree" which was played over the lighting of the signals. (Now being a guard doing nothing but waiting for another signal on a distant mountain top to be lit just so you can light your on yet another distant mountain top must be the worst job in the world).  The fact is I never really understood when people raved about scores in the past. Heck I thought it was a bit fruity (get the reference and get my love). But now I understand! I have seen the light!  I have done nothing much but vege out for the past couple of days since Christmas, but I am going back into the rat-race tomorrow which I am actually looking forward to. Having time off is fun and all that, but one gets the itching to return to normality sooner or later. There are only so many VH1 specials on the various fallacies of Hollywood celebrities before you just bored.  The California trip was called off (again). I swear that enough plan is cursed. This time my sister couldn't get out of some volunteer work she had to do for some school project. Really. Those organisations should be happy to get volunteers and shouldn't dictate when they wanted you. (kidding naturally).

      Decided on a whim to listen to some British radio. Gosh, I am falling asleep. Choose the station quiet randomly (it is BBC Radio Five), I wonder if it is the standard of British Radio.  On the other hand, I feel I can do a fake cockney accent now.  Went shopping with Lindz at Home Depot today simply to get some bracket and shelving for the new office and some snow melting salt for her steps. It was actually funnily enough quiet a domestic experience. I guess I now understand why married couples do this on Saturdays.  Possibly going on a roadtrip to Twin Falls Idaho later this week with a stopover in Jackpot, Nevada. Weee!  When I got home I went with my brother to the back of a church parking lot to teach him good breaking skills in the snow by doing donuts.   Oh... HAPPY LEAP DAY!!!!

      I have been waiting for warm weather since November and the last few days have not failed to impress. Heck, I already am sunbrurnt! I guess you can say I have never been accussed of not being excessive in a given situation if it involves either:  a: chocolate b: sex c: warm weather d: gossip 3: alcohol.  And of course, since this involves 'c', I went over the top and of course got sunburnt.  Actually, truth be told it was quiet by accident. I went skiing on Sunday up at Snowbasin. Lovely area, and I forgot completely to put sunscreen on the one area that wasn't covered up (the lower face). I thought at first it was a bit of windburn, nothing more serious then that, but only later in the evening when I was at home, did it start feeling like a sunburn.  Of course it just happens to look like I have some weird STD on the lower part of my face now, even it if it simply sunburn.  I have spent the last two days with a gooey aloe vera mess on my face to stop the worst of the peeling and burny feeling.  Then again I am not the only person walking around town with ski-mask sunburn (is that the correct terminology?), so at least I am not alone.to.

      Potatoe land... how do I love thee...  Actually I don't feel either which way about Idaho, in fact after spending two days here I am ready to go home to my nice comforting nest in Utah.  Went to Twin Falls, Idaho to help Lindsay pick up her dog as she didn't want to go by herself. Went to Jackpot on the Nevada/Idaho boarder to the Cactus Pete Casino. Pissy little boarder casino town. Blew $30.00 and that was enough for me.

      Okay, I know Driver's License Photos are never suppose to look good. There is a curse against humanity that specifically relates to drivers license photos, but seriously I must of had an extra helping of that curse at some stage.  I had to go and get a new Driver's License done today and thus I went down to the DMV in Farmington, and while the Staff there where really nice and friendly as alway (is it just me, or is the DMV staff the nicest of all the public sector branches?), my photo looked like hell.  I just cannot win, I am still sunburnt on the lower part of my face and even in the black and white temporary photo they gave me, I still look pretty bad. I cringe at the thought of the full coloured one that I am bound to get in the mail.

      I finally saw the infamous Mormon Episode of "South Park". It is sad how ingrained into Utahn culture I have become when I was able to nitpick various bits and pieces of the episode - then again it wasn't meant to be a factual account either - heck, the facts are clouded with controversy.  I couldn't figure out if Trey Parker and Matt Stone where subtley being anti-LDS or pro-LDS. Yes there was all the nitpicking apart of Joseph Smith, but it gave a rather positive message about LDS values.  My electric-razor has been broken for several days now. I am starting to develop something of a try hard beard. I cannot confess to liking it. I prefer my face clean shaven. After discovering the price of the replacement part (and not even a mechanical part, but the gauze that goes over the electric blades, which makes it all the more annoying), it will only cost about $15 more to buy a brand new electric-razor which I am going to do.  Good news though is that I found at my local B&N, Sara Douglass's "Beyond The Hanging Wall" to be half-price. I couldn't resist that bargin. The book isn't as good as the rest of her Trancendor/Wayfarer Redemption, but still tonnes better then half the drek out there. I finished it in a day.  I am rather pleased with myself. I didn't touch any junk food today.

      I am up awfully late. Dang awful late. I got up at 8am this morning to go to a breakfast meeting only to realise once I got there it was actually next Saturday. It is normally every second Saturday of the month and as this month the second Saturday occurs at the latest date possible, I naturally got things mixed up. Well that is my excuse and I am sticking to it. Heh.  So I dragged my weary sleep deprived body home and went straight back to bed (it is a Saturday, I am not going to be up if I don't have to). Then I promptly went to sleep. And I promptly woke up at 6:00 PM.  Aye curumba!  Talk about wasting a day. I'd figure that at worst I would sleep until 1:00 PM.  Well (alot of) sleep has helped dull the anger I was feeling yesterday. I was so ready for out-right revenge, only a few pegs sort of postal. But today I finally realise the meaning of the saying "revenge is a dish best served cold". 'Cold' I now know has nothing to do with temperature of refridgeration, but hard, logical calculation and well thought out ideas.  Actually that sounds rather menacing. Heck, I properly will do nothing more then complain to (the correct) people. But I can have my moments of grand illusions thinking I will do somethign on the level of a melodramatic soap-opera. Heck I want my damn melodramatic soap-opera. I earnt it!  Plus I have been listening to "Into The Woods" non-stop. Stephen Sondheim is a God. Odd though since my music taste tends to be pretty hard-core (think Punk/alt-Rock with some 80s guitar rifts thrown in), but that upbeat, funny, hilarious broadway soundtrack is definately a good thing to perked me up. Heck I am feeling perkier at the moment then Pamela Anderson after a cold shower.

      I made a new friend, Angela and she invited me to go have dinner with her last night at Greek Soulvaki with her sister and even though I had already eaten at the U's Humanities Happy Hour event, I just couldn't say no when it comes to Greek Food!  Saying that, even though I only managed to finish half my Gyro, it was still worth it. Plus Angela's sister was very witty and a blast to meet.  Got back from Los Angeles the other day and I have to admit I really do not like Los Angeles at all. Except Santa Monica. I really did enjoy Santa Monica alot. I like that amalgamated culture that it has there. It reminds me of the various beach towns near my Grandmothers where I use to spend my various school holidays as a child.  I need to cut down on the Mountain Dew though. I have been going through it like nobodies business and I swear I have put on 5 pounds just drinking that crap.

      I finally figured out the mystery of my new shirt. Actually it wasn't that much of a mystery, I figured it out when I got home last night and had a closer look at hit.  Apparantly it is labled 'small', when in fact the shirt is a medium/large. I guess the Kathy Lee wannabe who made the shirt didn't teach the little Malyasian children to sew on the right labels. The shirt is very asian in its cut, something that one would properly find on the streets of Toyko or Hong Kong.  Otherwise, it is summertime and all this sunshine is making me happy. Pessimism just cannot complete with bright sunshine.  Being a complete geek, I had a great tour of an old early mormon house on 200 South today. It was fun to see where the beta wives slept and sewed as opposed to the alpha wife. And all the kids in a dormatory type room.

      Mainly for S&G I went to DI today to look at some shirts. I am going to a nice event tomorrow, and while I wouldn't normally buy from DI for a nice event like tomorrow (I'd go to a high quailty shop at the Gateway), I had an hour to kill and I thought it would be fun.  Lo and behold that I found a brand new orange shirt and a gorgeous gold/silver tie. They are great quality, like they are overstock and the shirt is a fantastic cut and fits like a dream.  And nobody will be able to tell I got them from DI of all places, they look like I just bought them from an expensive name shop.

      Ever had a moment where you are on the verge of just dropping everything and running and damn the consequences?  I have been feeling those moments alot lately. I feel I am in a rut and I need to get out of it. Fast.  I do have some avenues of getting out of this rut, but they have yet to materialize completely yet. I am starting to get really diapointed in Amy. She was suppose to have helped me out in getting me a job somewhere interstate (anywhere but here). She said she would, she got my infomation of me, and I know she is in the position to get me something, and yet... silence.  Silence is not fucking golden.  Maybe I should hit up Liz & Sue again. I am sure they would give me something, but I just don't know.  I have decided what to get Tina and Eli for there wedding. It is so cool. I have never been to a lesbian wedding before, I cannot wait. I just have to figure out who I am going to bring along as a date. I am sure Lindsey would come if I ask her, but bringing your best friend along as a subsitute date seems kinda... desperate

        LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy. PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it. You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz.

      I enjoyed work alot today, Jesse came in and did alot of his work for Boston, and we just had a great old chat about anything and everything. Jesse is actually a really nice guy. Also completely unprentious and open and down to earth good. It is completely refreshing to know somebody like that. I need to get to know him more.  Doug gave me a copy of Dreamweaver. Yippee! Now I can go build that darn homepage I have been saying I will build since forever. I have purchased the domain name, now I just need to build a site. Once I get the check from Jenny, I will purchase some webspace, and I will be ready to join the cyberworld.  I so want a Gmail address it is not funny. I would love one gigabite worth of storage. Imagine never having to delete an e-mail again!  Today was just bright and sunny without being to warm. It was just a really good day. I am such a summer freak. I love this season.  Holly sent me an e-mail. She is going to Vegas for a Madonna concert. Lucky Devil. I am so jealous.  Went to Mandi's sister's house for a CC meeting tonight. It is in the Uintah Township up in Weber County, I have driven past it a thousand times, but never actually been in it, it is such a cool neighbourhood, tucked between a couple of big freaking hills and is really cut off from alot of the world. Also Wendy's house is HUGE. I loved it.

      Before Last week this is all the states I have ever been to:      Now I can add FIVE more states to the list:       Admittedly Iowa is a bit of a cheat, since I visited the one extreme south-west county only and that was seriously for all of 10 minutes (that is how long it took from leaving Missouri to entering Nebraska).  Nebraska and Kansas are not as flat as everybody makes them out to be, while there obviously wasn't any mountains, there was a few hills and dales. There was the big shopping center built over the I-80 in central Nebraska though.  The freakiest thing happened in Wyoming, we where just driving back, maybe 20 minutes past Green River, when all of a sudden it started snowing and BAM! Instant Whiteout. Yes at this time of year, with summer almost upon us. I don't get it either.  It was scary. I had never been in a white-out before. Luckily I was only shot-gun at that stage and not driving, and Curtis knew what to do (hazzard lights, 30 mph etc).  When I got back to Salt Lake, I told the story to several different people and 3 people told me about late season snow problems they had in Wyoming as well, including my boss who was stuck in Laramie for 4 days due to heavy snowing!

      Funny my last post was about Angela. She left for Europe yesterday. Lucky ducky. Well she will be gone for two whole months travelling all the wonderful places, while I am stuck here in Salt Lake City.  Then again I shouldn't complain, I did spend several days with her and A, S and Curtis on a roadtrip to Kansas City. Heck she was barely back from that trip before she had to fly to Europe. What a committed girl.  We overnighted in Denver, which I have to say is an exceptionally beautiful city. I love it alot. Kansas City was also grand, though rather humid. After living in the dry heat for 8 years one has forgotten what the humidity is like (even if one spent the first 16 years of his life in the sub-tropics).  I did met alot of new people and had alot of fun, the one problem is (which I always have after trips like this) is I am itching to go somewhere else, get out of my routine again. I need to travel, do something, anything.

      So I actually did go to Herriman. Lord it is so BFE, it is beautiful, lovely, well of, respectable and nice BFE, but it is still BFE all the way (especially since it it like at 13400 South and 6400 West). I will admit that the Toxic Slag Mountains of Kennecutt do make for a picturesque sunset view. Of course I would never drink the ground water with them around, but visually, quiet nice.  I was in the Fort Herriman Days Parade. It was quiet nice. But long, I swear I walked the entire length and breath of Herrimen. But we got alot of positive feedback and it was nice to all be in matching shirts.  The only issue is we where two positions in front of the Riverton Junior High Brass Band. I swear if I ever hear "Stars and Stripes Forever" again it will be to soon. At least we where not behind the karoke float (I was in front of one a couple of years ago in the Sunset Parade... it was bad).  I ended up getting quiet windy in the end, odd considering Herriman is closely surrounded on two sides by mountains (both of the natural and slag heap variety). Frankly got this excellent photo of me in the wind. I need to get a copy.  Yikes I cannot believe I have written an entire entry on Herriman of all places. Well stranger things have happened...

      I wanna play Ultimate Frisbee this summer! I really do want to play it bad.  Actually I have by chance started a collection of normal frisbees. I am going to so many festivals, parades and events recently where organisations give away free stuff. And normally there is at least one frisbee in that mix. I got a Qwest frisbee from when I attended Juneteenth and a Wells Fargo frisbee from when I attended Pride Day. I have a few more events over the next couple of weeks, and I plan to collect more.  Though I still need somebody to play ulitimate frisbee with.

      I can accept slow drivers in the right hand lane, that is where they should be, that is the place those stupid videos at Drivers Ed tell them to be (remember that Disney one with the guy that looked like Goofy?). But when they are in the far left hand lane and still going 10 fricking miles BELOW the speed limit (and that is the speed limit in the right hand land, not the progressive increases that would occur in the other lanes), THAT is a hazard and they should be pulled over and have given a good finger wagging.  Other then that I had a great day. I went for a job up City Creek today. Mainly to get exercise, but I have to admit there was a little bit of me that wanted to get rid of the wife-beater tan line I got last week. When I finished the jog, I had the oddest... and strongest craving for beer and stake (carbs and proteins I guess). Well luckily as soon as a refreshened I was off to Nichole's for a BBQ her dad and her where having.  So two hand burgers, two hot dogs, a couple of beers and a nice glass of red later, I was full and content.  The wheather was a bit freaky, one minute as hot as buggery the next minute showers and snap chills. Oh well. At least it cooled out and there was a happy medium in the end.

      When I was leaving my office today, I saw a double rainbow. Not just any double rainbow. BOTH rainbows where a full 180 degrees rainbows I could see where both rainbows faded into the houses on both ends. The North end was up by the university and the south end was down near 9th & 9th. The things where HUGE! It was a magnificant site and I felt like I could seriously reach out and touch it. The sky was already a funny yellow colour due to all these storms. But wowsers!  I seriously wish I had my camera with me. I would of been a seriously beautiful set of photos. The inner rainbow was very vivid and you can easily see all the colours as they where very bright. The outer rainbow was not as bright, but it still was impressive.

      I had a good venting session with Marcie today. The great thing about Marcie is that we get to vent each of our personal fraustrations to each other and know it will be confidencial and will not get out to the people we are venting about.  Though the thing is just getting it out of the system really does help and I feel I know can now have greater clarity in sorting out my problems and situations.  Went over to Lindsey's house tonight. Originally she just wanted to show me her new house since she just moved in, then go out shopping. We didn't get to go shopping but we hung out at her house watching silly MTV programing involving stupid celebrities.  It actually go distrubingly domestic after a while when she starting to cook dinner and I helped her out by cleaning up her backyard and putting everything away for her.

      Since I have Pride Day on the weekend I decided to go thrift shopping at the local DI yesterday to see if I can find something completely outrageous to wear (sadly normal stores are completely boring in terms for fun clothing).  Nothing great, did buy a couple of ordinary things, but I did find, believe it or not a "Orrin Hatch for President" tshirt. Its novelty value alone was worth the price (all of three bucks).  I am really wanting to dye my hair for some reason. No idea why. Maybe dye it orange. (yeah, shock horror at the colour).  My mother made some colsaw tonight. It was full of onions and mustard. It was the hottest colsaw I ever had. I didn't even know colcaw could be made hot!!!

      I know I am somewhat late on this particular game, but just call me a slow poke. A few weeks ago "Blender Magazine" http://www.blender.com/articles/article_786.html came out with a list of its 50 worst songs of all time. After looking at the list I don't really know if it is really a list of the 50 worst songs of all time (I can think of alot worse ones). And frankly there are alot of songs on that list I DO LIKE!  Especially the so-called number one worst song on that list  "We Build This City"  by Starship. I love this song. This seriously is the first mainstream rock/pop song I remember listening to (on the car radio) and liking, and remember the lyrics to (well the chorus - I was like 5) and singing along to. Okay call it sentimental bias, but I really do like that song!  Okay with the list, being the geek that I am, I have bolded all the songs I really do like on it, so without further ado:   1. We Built This City ... Starship  2. Achy Breaky Heart ... Billy Ray Cyrus I loved this at one point. 3. Everybody Have Fun Tonight ... Wang Chung 4. Rollin' ... Limp Bizkit   5. Ice Ice Baby ... Vanilla Ice   6. The Heart of Rock & Roll ... Huey Lewis and the News  7. Don't Worry, Be Happy ... Bobby McFerrin   8. Party All the Time ... Eddie Murphy  9. American Life ... Madonna  10. Ebony and Ivory ... Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder 11. Invisible ... Clay Aiken 12. Kokomo ... The Beach Boys   (I loved the Muppets version better actually.)  13. Illegal Alien ... Genesis  14. From a Distance ... Bette Midler  15. I'll Be There for You ... The Rembrandts 16. What's Up? ... 4 Non Blondes   17. Pumps and a Bump ... Hammer 18. You're the Inspiration ... Chicago 19. Broken Wings ... Mr. Mister  20. Dancing on the Ceiling ... Lionel Richie  21. Two Princes ... Spin Doctors  22. Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American) ... Toby Keith  23. Sunglasses at Night ... Corey Hart  24. Superman ... Five for Fighting 25. I'll Be Missing You ... Puff Daddy featuring Faith Evans and 112  26. The End ... The Doors  27. The Final Countdown ... Europe  28. Your Body Is a Wonderland ... John Mayer   29. Breakfast at Tiffany's ... Deep Blue Something   (I adore this song)   30. Greatest Love of All ... Whitney Houston 31. Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm ... Crash Test Dummies   32. Will 2K ... Will Smith   33. Barbie Girl ... Aqua  34. Longer ... Dan Fogelberg   35. Shiny Happy People ... R.E.M.   36. Make Em Say Uhh! ... Master P  37. Rico Suave ... Gerardo 38. Cotton Eyed Joe ... Rednex  39. She Bangs ... Ricky Martin  40. I Wanna Sex You Up ... Color Me Badd  41. We Didn't Start the Fire ...Billy Joel  42. The Sounds of Silence ... Simon & Garfunkel   (Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?)  43. Follow Me ... Uncle Kracker  44. I'll Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That) ... Meat Loaf  45. Mesmerize ... Ja Rule featuring Ashanti   46. Hangin' Tough ... New Kids on the Block  47. The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You ... Bryan Adams  48. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da ... The Beatles  49. I'm Too Sexy ... Right Said Fred 50. My Heart Will Go On ... Celine Dion    Crikey, I didn't realise that there where so many songs on that list I actually do like, though I think the list is truly flawed without such "classics" on it as  "Agadoo"  By Black Lace,  "Star Trakking"  By Dr. Demento (well actually any Dr. Demento song can be on that list) and that horrid Don Johnson song from his "Miami Vice" days just to name a few.  Of course, being a real geek I must list what songs I physically own on CE, weather it be an album, single or complimation track.   1. We Built This City ... Starship 11. Invisible ... Clay Aiken 12. Kokomo ... The Beach Boys 14. From a Distance ... Bette Midler  15. I'll Be There for You ... The Rembrandts 16. What's Up? ... 4 Non Blondes  21. Two Princes ... Spin Doctors 24. Superman ... Five for Fighting 25. I'll Be Missing You ... Puff Daddy featuring Faith Evans and 112 29. Breakfast at Tiffany's ... Deep Blue Something 30. Greatest Love of All ... Whitney Houston 33. Barbie Girl ... Aqua 44. I'll Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That) ... Meat Loaf  47. The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You ... Bryan Adams  48. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da ... The Beatles  50. My Heart Will Go On ... Celine Dion   Okay that wasn't as bad as I thought, but that is mainly cause I am not a huge buyer of CDs these days. About 4-5 years ago, I use to spend all my spare money on new CDs, but these days I am really not into CDs these much, and if I do on that rare occassion buy them, it will be by old favorite artists.

      I have been playing   urlLink this game   for the last hour. It is freaking hilarious. rather easy in fact. I clocked it pretty fast, the only issue was I needed to use the potty while fighting Darth Rumsfeld and I couldn't find the pause button, and thus I lost Edwards in the battle while I rushed upstairs to relieve myself on the loo.  Hilarious none the less.

      Traffic was exceptionally heavy today up the I-15. I left the office at 4 O'Clock to avoid it, but since I had to go to Sherrie's office to drop of a registration form and thus entered from 2100 South instead of my usual Beck Street exit, I got caught in a hugh traffic-fuck.  I swore I lost five pounds just being in the hot car. Argh. I wish the stupid air conditioning is working. It was hot hot hot! And not in a good sweaty Carribean Beach way either. Especially since I was in my suit (well I did take the jacket off).  Well I am at home now, I do have an event up in Washington Terrace in half an hour, but I decided to come home for a while (since I live half way in between) and let myself and the car have a good cool down.

      My back is killing me at the moment, I have this knot right in the upper middle section of my back (around the middle of the lower shoulderblades), that is starting to get unbareable. I have never been one to have sore backs or anything (the occasional cramped neck or shoulder from sleeping on it funny, but that is it), thus this annoying pain (not really hurtful, more fraustrating) is really getting to me.

      Okay, one thing that annoys me more in life then alot of other things is people not returning phonecalls. I always try to answer every single phone call I recieve even ones I don't particularly want to answer. The only tiem I cannot answer the phone is when it is off (ie; in a meeting), I am already on the line to somebody else, phsyically unable to or it is recharging in another room and i don't here the ring.  And even if one of those rare events happen, I try to return the phone call as soon as darn possible. I pride myself on my professional phone ettiquette and it just annoys me ever so slightly that other people do not have the same standard.  Argh.   [/end rant]

      Life is no fun when you have a headache. Even with a couple of headache pain releavers, long showers and cold compresses, life just doesn't have the same spark to it.  Argh. Being philosophical about headaches is pretty bad. What is worse is waking up from the headache at some God-forsaken hour of the morning after the headache has gone (thankfully the headache pain releavers finally kicked in).  I have done nothing constructive with my time since being up (then again it is the wee hours of the morning), except doing silly quizzes. But at least I know what mad historical figure I am. Heh.  Well I might as well stay up. I have a breakfast meeting at work today, and I would be getting up in a couple of hours anyway for that.  I think I might have a bowl of fruit loops. Yes. Fruit Loops. I have not had that delicious childhood breakfast treat in years, and I know there is a box of them in the pantry.

Daughter of legendary crap TV producer Aaron Spelling, you cut your teeth on daddy's high quality programing, and moved on to fantastic TV fare like Co-ed Call Girl, A Friend to Die For, and Mother, May I Sleep with Danger?  In fact, many people argue that you wouldn't be famous if it weren't for your family connections. But as far as those go, it could have been much worse: your brother Randy wound up with a part in Sunset Beach.  In 1994, you also had to have plastic surgery on your nose, due to a particularly nasty parrot bite. Poor dear.  You can tell the world you're an acting in-joke with the following glorious badge:

       urlLink     urlLink Which Famous Homosexual Are You?    urlLink Brought to you by Rum and Monkey     How spiffing! You're  Alexander the Great !  Yeah, baby. You were the King of Macedonia, and conqueror of much of the world; you're responsible for the spread of Christianity, as well as Hellenistic society and even the Roman Empire. Your power was feared for thousands of miles around.  And how gay were you. When you'd conquered Persia, you fell in love with a male courtier from that court - scandalous in those days, because the Persians were believed to be uncivilised barbarians.  You were always really in love with your boyhood friend, Hephaestion, and when he died you were grief-stricken to a legendary degree: convinced that he would live on after death, you passed away soon afterwards.   Does this mean I get Jared Leto? Heh heh heh...

       urlLink     urlLink Which Historical Lunatic Are You?    urlLink From the fecund loins of Rum and Monkey.     You are Charles VI of France, also known as Charles the Mad or Charles the Well-Beloved!   A fine, amiable and dreamy young man, skilled in horsemanship and archery, you were also from a long line of dribbling madmen. King at 12 and quickly married to your sweetheart, Bavarian Princess Isabeau, you enjoyed many happy months together before either of you could speak anything of the other's language. However, after illness you became a tad unstable. When a raving lunatic ran up to your entourage spouting an incoherent prophecy of doom, you were unsettled enough to slaughter four of your best men when a page dropped a lance. Your hair and nails fell out. At a royal masquerade, you and your courtiers dressed as wild men, ending in tragedy when four of them accidentally caught fire and burned to death. You were saved by the timely intervention of the Duchess of Berry's underskirts.   This brought on another bout of sickness, which surgeons countered by drilling holes in your skull. The following months saw you suffer an exorcism, beg your friends to kill you, go into hyperactive fits of gaiety, run through your rooms to the point of exhaustion, hide from imaginary assassins, claim your name was Georges, deny that you were King and fail to recognise your family. You smashed furniture and wet yourself at regular intervals. Passing briefly into erratic genius, you believed yourself to be made of glass and demanded iron rods in your attire to prevent you breaking.   In 1405 you stopped bathing, shaving or changing your clothes. This went on until several men were hired to blacken their faces, hide, jump out and shout "boo!", upon which you resumed basic hygiene. Despite this, your wife continued sleeping with you until 1407, when she hired a young beauty, Odette de Champdivers, to take her place. Isabeau then consoled herself, as it were, with your brother. Her lovers followed thick and fast while you became a pawn of your court, until you had her latest beau strangled and drowned.   A severe fever was fended off with oranges and pomegranates in vast quantities, but you succumbed again in 1422 and died. Your disease was most likely hereditary. Unfortunately, you had anywhere up to eleven children, who variously went on to develop capriciousness, great cruelty, insecurity, paranoia, revulsion towards food and, in one case, a phobia of bridges.

      Lucky Post 101    Well life is going okay, I cannot complain, working, doing some nice stuff. I am going to have some good fun helping out with a conference next week.    Still I feel down for some reason. Not depressed down, no, nothing like that. Just lonely down. I don't have anybody to share all this wonderful stuff I have happening with my life with. I just would like a couple of friends to share with to tell me stuff to, the usual jazz. Oh well. I guess I may not have been meant for such niceness.

      Elbow Elbow Wrist Wrist   Another Day, another parade, this time West Jordan in the morning and Sandy in the evening. At least that is the last of them for a short while. Well I hope. One more parade and I will pelting the candy at the darling little brats instead of throwing them.  Went to Sugarhouse park in the afternoon between parades and caught up with Megan, Jesse and Anne in their little tent, wish I could've stayed instead of going to Sandy, but the Sandy gig was a part of my new paying job (#1). At least I got to met Will who will be working with my on paying job (#2). Seems like a decent bloke. At least I ate.  Well I guess I must be the only one missing Utah's fabulous 3rd of July fireworks celebrations, but after Sandy, my cell phone was dead, I was starting to develope a headache and it started to rain a tad. I just decided to call it a day and drive home.  Well happy ID4 peoples.

      I have rediscovered old my old CD's of "The Corrs" last night after having a long conversation with Kass about them. She introduced me to their cover of Jimmy Hendrix's "Little Bird", I dittoed it back by indroducing her to their cover of Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams".  Anyway from that, I have listend to all my old CDs, going all the way back to 1996. It is nice to sometimes to discover old friends and favorites again.  Plus Andrea Corr is still freaking H-O-T after all these years. Actually the entire family is very doable and I would have trouble saying no to any of them if they came a'knocking at my door one day.  Gave the Building Key back to Arlyn today instead of Tuesday. Still have the office key, actually the only reason I gave the building key back today is they are one building key short in the office (Lord knows what happened to either Bryan's or Adam's after they left a few short weeks ago).  I have been on my job all of one day, and I love it! Rang and co-ordinated around today, and it is cool. Tommorrow I got to drive to Taffy Town to pick up 8 boxes of Candy for the Sandy 4th of July parade of all things. But it is so fun! Had great conversations with Trisha and Adrienne today. When I told Laurie about my new job she squealed in delight. I am really lucky to have just great friends.  Went to The Bajou this evening to have dinner with Danny. I orded the Sweet Potato fires. Gosh, I LOVE those sweet potato fries. Thankfully I was not that hungry so that is all I had, well that and the ice tea. It was really odd to go into a bar (even a trendy bar like The Bajou which has a full menu) and not order any alcohol. Well my wallet is happy at any rate.
