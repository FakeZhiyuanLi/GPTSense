      Ok so I talked to Keith today and for anyone who doesnt know that is my ex but I still love him more than anything.  I dont know how I could be so stupid to break up with him I should have just talked about it and not believed everyone else.  I MISS HIM. I took him his birthday present today and I dropped it off at his house he wasnt home so I just gave it to his mom.  I talked to him later on that day and man I didnt realize how much I missed him and how much fun I had with him it is weird how someone can change you so much and you now even know it.  I try to be happy when I am around all my friends but you see everyone else that has a b/f or a g/f and you just think where is the other half of you at.  I miss my other half he always made me happy and made me samile when I was sad. I guess you dont realize just how happy you are till you lose something or someone so hold on to whatever you have and dont take anything for granted.  Jess

      Ok sorry I havent wrote in here like in 2 days I dunno for sure, but anyways.  I went shopping with Sarah today it wasnt really shopping b/c I didnt get anything for myself I just had to get Keith a birthday present although he prolly doesnt deserve one but I feel bad.  I also got to see Lindsay who I missed so much.  Tomorrow I get to go play bball in the morning and then go to the guys bball game and then out to eat with the group or atleast lindsay and sarah I dont care who else goes I would just perfer some individuals not to go but what can you do?......kick their butt....:)  j/k I am a good kid at times.  I finally went into town to buy my Alvarado sticker to go on the back of my explorer it was so much fun to put it on there.  I am officially a teenager with an alvarado sticker on my explorer I love it.  Well that was my day I hope you had a good day actually I dont really care.    Jess

      So today is Tuesday, June 22, 2004 well if Keith and I were still together it would have been 1 year and 5 months.  I miss him so much but there is nothing I can do so.  Omg last night I was sleeping out in the camper at Sarahs house b/c I have no idea you would think Sarah likes to be scared.....lol Well Sarah is the one who always hears the noises and I kinda hear them but I try to ignore them b/c everyone knows that your mind can play tricks on you.  Well last night I heard like every noise and it was kinda scary b/c I didnt know what it was so I asked Sarah if she heard anything and at times she did, but she knew that if I heard the noises than there was something out there.  We never figured out what it was but we heard it like all last night and I mean I was so tired but I couldnt go to sleep b/c I was scared.  My aunt and uncle might be getting a divorce and I feel so bad for the kids b/c they have four and 3 of them are not even old enough to know what is going on but the one that does has to stay with her dad b/c she wants to take care of him.  It is awful I dunno what I would do if my parents ever got a divorce.  Well I have to go for now.....  Jess

      Do you ever wonder why things happen? I heard everything happens for a reason but I wish I always knew the reason.  I broke up with my boyfriend last thursday and I had gone out with him for a year and like about to be 5 months.  I miss him so much and I still love him more than anything.  I had my reasons but someone lied to me about everything and made it seem alot worse than it was.  I just wish that I would have never been so jealous.  I hate the way things are right now.  Anyways not like anyone wants to hear this but I just had to say it.  I have some of the best friends ever who have been there for me through all of this and who are prolly extremely tired of me talking about and being sad. But I just want to say thanks to all of you.  I cant wait till I go to Padre this summer b/c I am just going to have so much fun.  I also cant wait till Sarah and I go to Oklahoma to see my cousin and uncle.  That is all going to be a blast.  Summer just officially started today and it was pretty fun.  I helped my dad put shocks on my explorer that was fun I love working on cars.  I cant wait till we move it is going to be so fun to be like the only girl in my house that my mom has to buy for I am going to be even more spoiled than I am now.  I feel like I need to get a job b/c it feels like Sarah and I are the only ones who dont have a job this summer.  I dont want one though b/c I dont want to miss out on all the fun, and I kinda like not having to work b/c my mom just gets me what I want.  Well I am going to watch t.v.   Jess

      Today is kinda boring so far just woke up and lifted weights.  This weekend was pretty interesting and kinda fun at times sad at other times.  I went to out to eat Thursday and i have great guy friends who I didn't know that were such good friends until I needed them and not to mention my absolute best friend ever Sarah she has always been there for me and I am so thankful.  Friday I went to the movies and saw Dodgeball it was an awesome and hilarous movie.  Saturday night i went with Sarah and Steven we were suppose to go to the movies but we just didnt feel like spending $8 again so we saved our money and went to to Walmart it was a blast.  I pushed Steven in the basket and i let go and he went straight into a pole Sarah and I laughed so hard it was unreal.  He is a blast to hang out with.  Well tonight Sarah and I are going to the guys basketball game.  That is all for now and    dont ever give up your real friends for anyone.   Jess

       I got home from Sarah's house at about 5:30 and I decided that maybe since school is starting soon I should run with my sister and her husband who run like everyday they are crazy.....lol&nbsp; So me attempt to run a whole mile was crazy I havent worked out much this summer I lifted weights over at Sarahs house a couple of times but that is about it.&nbsp; So I ended up only running about 3/4 of a mile and I cannot feel my legs I feel like a noodle. I can't believe school starts in just a couple of weeks.&nbsp; So ppl say you should always tell ppl how you feel, you will feel better about it.&nbsp; So I did and nothing has changed nothing has happened.&nbsp; I think no one knows for sure.&nbsp; And I wish that ppl would just tell you the truth all the time well at least most of the time like when you really need it like whether or not everyone in the whole world thinks your ex-boyfriend is gay, well thank god that is over with.&nbsp; You only live once and I guess I can say I dated a fag, who doesnt realize he is a fag yet or he knows but doesnt want anyone else to know well I hope comes out soon......lol b/c that will be hilarous. Well that is all for now and I guess I will write in here whenever I get bored again....lol   Love always,   Jess

        So I havent wrote in here in like 8 days, well my computer dont work so I only write when I come over to Sarahs and I come over more often then every 8 days I just dont feel&nbsp; like writing in here.&nbsp; Do you ever wonder why when one of your wishes comes true it is not all it is cracked up to be.&nbsp; Well I do and I wonder why you wait your whole life for that one guy the one who is suppose to be your one true love how do you know that there is only one true love what if you neer find that true love I have no clue why I am writing about this but this is just what I started typing about.&nbsp; Well anyways school starts soon and I really dont want to go back to Alvarado b/c there is so much B*S* there, but I have so many memories and only two years there left and plus I dont know what I would do if I ever left my best friend Sarah she is like one of the only reasons I am gonna stay here well except for Lauren and amber who are freakin hilarous.&nbsp; I love most of my friends but some of them are just plain b*tches and hoes who I dont care to be around.&nbsp; Do you ever get tired of being someone for too long well I think that is how I am with high school I kind of want a change.&nbsp; I really cant wait for football season that is going to be awesome.&nbsp; I went over to Lindsays house for a little bit today and it was fun we looked at old pictures and I can not believe how retarded I looked when I was a kid but those were fun days when you didnt care about anything.&nbsp; I am so glad that I am almost done with high school b/c then I am off to college and out of here.&nbsp; I dont have anything interesting going on right now except for the fact that everyone thought my ex-boyfriend was a fag I kinda of thought he was gay but never really payed attention to it but I wish someone would have told me that everyone thought he was gay.&nbsp; I should have caught on when he started worrying about if his hair looked good or not.&nbsp; Well what can you do you only live once and you learn from your mistakes and I sure as hell hope that if he really is gay he finds himself a boyfriend and doesnt date anymore girls for cover ups b/c that is just messed up.&nbsp; This weekend I am either going out of town or to the movies I kind of hope to the movies but then again I want to go out of town b/c I dont ever spend time with my family but I know this is sad I just have more fun with my friends.&nbsp; I guess that is all I got to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; O yeah Sarah and I are not watching t.v. for 2 days lets see how long that will last?!     Love always,     Jess

      OMG.......I have waited for this day ever since last summer. It is finally here and Sarah, her mom, and i leave for Padre in about an hour who would have ever thought that I would be so xicted to leave this town well I guess it it not so much the town more like the ppl.  I am so happy like I cant wait to get in the car and just leave i want to leave right now just to get away from here for a week I am going to have a blast no matter what I think I deserve a good vacation after the past few weeks and i dont know that it could get any better b/c I get to go with my best friend who has been there for me through everything and I am so thankful that I have a friend like her.  I will miss my parents and my siblings and prolly monte and pt but other than that I dont know that I will miss any of my friends b/c some of those ppl just arent friends and are back stabbers but what can you do?  I hope everyone else has fun staying here i will miss a couple of you but not a whole lot so dont flatter yourself b/c you are prolly one of the ones I wont miss..........:)   Love ya' Jess

      ok so today was pretty kool and it is not even over yet....Sarah had to come over and stay with me b/c some guy was coming to my house to check this leak and my parents didnt want me to be there by myself.  I am like trying this new thing like where I am nice to like everyone and trying not to be mean b/c supposedly I am a really mean person when I dont think I am rude it is just ppl dont know how to deal with the truth but I cant change ppl I can only try to change myself for the best.  I am having a party and I decided to invite like everyone that I hang out with even ppl I hardly ever talk to.  I dont know how long this new "Nice Jessica" will last seeing as how I told keith last night that being nice is not paying off yet and he told me I had to be patience and give it time.  I DONT HAVE PATIENCE.  But I am going to try really hard.  I went out to eat with Jen Patty and Sarah last night it was pretty fun I guess you could say it was "HOT" waiter night last night b/c they were extremely hot.  Today I went to go get some groceries it was kinda kool feeling like i was an adult, but I dont want to grow up yet.  I drove by the firework stand that Keith was suppose to be working at so I could invite him and Ashley to the party but when Sarah and I drove by we saw them swimming and I dont think that is working but what can you do I wish I could get payed for doing absolutely nothing.  I miss all my friends.  I really just cant wait till Sarah and I go to Padre b/c I think I need to get away for a little while b/c everything here is like a reminder of what I had and dont have anymore and wish I did have.  I really wish I could move to a different school b/c I want to like start over and if I could start over it would be great b/c no one would know what you were like before and they would just want to get to know you but I dont know that it would be all that great b/c I am not the kind of person who just goes up to ppl and start talking to them.  i wish I was more like that but what can you do I get too nervous, and when I do get nervous I just ramble on about God knows what.  I really hope everyone comes to my house for my party it should be pretty kool.  Sarah and I were going to go to ppls houses today to give them directions to my new home but no one was home so that was pointless.  Well I guess that is all for now and I hope that my computer will be put up soon so I dont have to wait till I come to my other home(Sarahs house) to write on here and talk to everyone. Talk to you later  Jess

       Last night Lauren, Amber, and Sarah came over which was a blast o wait and Steven came over too to help put up the tent he is such a nice guy.  It felt so good outside to camp out well it wasnt really camping out but it was sleeping in a tent.  Which was pretty cool  I love the whole outdoor camping thing.  I was so glad to have amber and sarah over at the same time that was GREAT.  I know Sarah prolly thinks that I have been treating her like crap I dont think I have but who knows I might have I usually just got caught up in the moment and I feel bad b/c she is one of my best friends who I absolutely love like a sister it is just we spend so much time together and I always feel like I dont give her and pt enough time to spend together so that is why I was hanging out with other ppl.  Sorry if I hurt you in anyway Sarah......Love ya'    Amber and I have been kind of hanging out a little lately it is pretty cool she makes me laugh so much......glad we started hanging out again and you are welcome to come spend the night at my house anytime you dont want to be home at curfew....Love ya'   I was so glad to see Lauren b/c she always can make me laugh like how we sat at that  GREEN    light b/c we werent paying any attention to the lights and I didnt realize I oculd go......lmao that was a blast we work as a good team when we are trying to write on Stevens car........by the way he is a great guy who is kind of going in the wrong direction b/c he talks to Shaunda and I think anyone who talks to her is pretty much just asking for trouble b/c she is just a bad kid........her boyfriend by the way (Zac) is pretty cool and I feel sorry for him b/c I think he feels obligated to be with her she treats him like crap and if she cheats on him again I will be severly PISSED.......So tomorrow is my last day of summer and I think I will go out with a BOOM...:)   I am going to go out to eat with all my friends and I really hope like some ppl dont go like Shaunda and Lin and patty other than that I will be absolutely happy.  I really hope no I will make tomorrow be a night I wont forget b/c I dont ever want summer to be over but I know I have to end up going to school and that sucks b/c I dont really care for school or the B*S* that goes with it but this year if ppl want to screw with me I will screw with you and I dont care who you are.......:)   I hope everyone else had a great summer b/c mine will never be fogotten.......:)  Well I guess I will head to bed or at least to go watch t.v. till Sarah or Amber get online....and I still cant tell you how glad I am that they are friends again and I know it is kind of weird still I mena at some moments there is still kind of silence but hopefully we all will get everything back to normal.......Love you all    Mess

       So I woke up kinda late today would have slept later but I had to go to the restroom.  Anyways when I got online I was so excited to hear that Amber and Sarah were on talking terms again now I hope that things get better instead of worse b/c I miss hanging out with the both of them and this whole thing was just a big mess.  I think they are going to spend the night tonight and I am pretty sure Lauren might spend the night also, that is pretty cool b/c Lauren is awesome, and it will just be cool to be hanging out with my friends seeing as how Saturday I leave to go out of town and I dotn get back till Monday and then Tuesday we go back to school so my summer kind of ends Friday Night. :(  Man have I had a blast this summer I dont know what it would have been like if I didnt have the friends I have.  i spent most of the summer with Sarah that is no surprise and I was so EXCITED to start hanging out with Brandy again b/c she has always been one of my best friends and I cant believe I ever stopped talking to her.  This summer has been pretty interesting actually.  At the beginning of the summer I was getting ready for my sisters wedding which was a blast, but mine is going to be better.  Sarah, Pt, and Keith were there and they met my uncle Jody and his family they loved him and he loved them.  About a week after that I broke up with Ketih b/c he cheated, but what can you do?  Forgive and Forget?!  Then I just hung out with Sarah and Jared and Steven a couple of times.  That was cool went to some of the guys summer league games.  When we went to one of them there was a fight that was cool.  Then July came and I went to Padre with Sarah and her mom that was a blast it was so pretty down there and I want to go back without a parent and just like a group of friends.  I hung out with Crystal Mikey and Jack and Abel a littl bit this summer that was a blast.   I went camping wtih them twice.  The second time was better b/c we went to turner falls and Sarah went with us and I had a blast it was pretty but too many Mexicans.lol   I also had a fourth of july party which was ok except some girls need to learn how to not bother ppl.  Went to the Movies a couple of times.  Found out Steven really needs to get some from someone b/c he is so HORNY....lol and he is also scared of Scary movies and that is hilarous.  It is winding down to the last couple of days for me and the carnival is here and that is pretty cool.  I went to the carnival Monday with Sarah and then tuesday with Amber and Lauren met us up there.  Today I think Sarah might go and Amber and Lauren and I are going to go ride the rides I am pretty excited I love these rides.  They are going to spend the night at my house tonigth and we might camp out but I dunno.  I cant wait to go out of town b/c this will be like our last family vacation for a good long time, I mean like are whole family is going to go see our other family this will be kind of sad I miss my brother and sister.  Well I got to go ttyl    Love always'   Jess

       Well this weekend had been fun so far I went out with Amber and Brandy last night and man did we have fun I miss Sarah and I hope she is having fun.  Amber, Brandy, and I went to the movies and it was a good movie I had to tell some hood rats to shut up during the movie they looked at me like they were ready to fight I wasnt scared in fact I thought it was funny.  I saw my cousin there he is pretty coolo and I guess that is good seeing as how he will be a fish this year when school starts.  I cant believe I will finally be a junior cant wait till next year to say goodbye to everybody except my family and the couple of ppl I like in this town.  Well after the movie we ran into clayton it was good to see him he had some facial hair didnt look to shabby...lol  As we were leaving the parking lot I told Brandy to stop so we could write on his windows o what fun that was.  He wasnt too happy but I had fun and that is all that matters.  I liked not caring and I think that is how I am going to be these last two years kinda care less.  After that we went to walmart and that was an adventure itself b/c I mean like amber said three girls in mini skirts yeah we turned a couple of heads, but nothing I am not use to b/c when I am with Sarah we do that crap all the time....lol still miss her...lol   Well we then went to Burger King and won some free food...pretty cool!  After that we kinda called it a night b/c we didnt want Amber getting home too late it was close enough as it is.  So today I took the advice of my very good friend and tried the whole family thing...pretty cool I might add you should try it sometime.  I had fun and I got some school clothes when I was out.  I really hate school clothes shopping b/c of all the dress code and I know ppl think we shouldnt but I dont think uniforms would be that bad I mean I would save money and then could get clothes I really like.  My sister went with us and I was glad b/c now that she is married it kind of sucks not seeing her all the time.  I remember when I was little and my sister my two brothers and I had so much fun, we always made each other laugh.  I miss them.  Tomorrow my uncle comes down I am glad b/c I miss him a whole bunches and his family.  My other uncle is having another kid I guess that is pretty cool but it is weird b/c all the other kids are grown up and now we have like baby cousins and I dunno sometimes babies bug me, but I still love them.  Well I guess that is all b/c I am bored and kinda tired but I dunno if I will be able to go to sleep took a nap earlier.  Goodnight   Love always   Jess

       Ok I have these two friends who I love so very much and one of them I miss alot.  I know they both have their reasons for being mad but I just wish they both werent so stubborn and they both think that they are right.  In a way I see both of their sides of view and in a way I dont.  Us three have been friends for along time and now I dont know if them two are friends anymore and it makes me really sad b/c I spend all my time with one of them and we have fun and stuff but I can tell she misses our little sis.   I was mad at her too but mainly only b/c we dont see her that much anymore she always made me laugh and with her there we could both talk the other one   into anything.  We had so much fun I mean I dont know any other ppl who got together and just laughed so much and just had a great time.  I have tried everything to get them to talk again and it doesnt seem to work b/c I am scared I will end up pissing one of them off and I dont want them to hate me b/c then I know there goes any chance of us ever being friends again.  I just wish that they would get over it and sit down and actually talk.  I know they both want to be friends again and I want us three to hang out again and to go to football games b/c we missed that last year and we only have two years left and I dont know what I will do if you two dont talk again, I mean actually are friends as close to how it use to be as possible.  I miss the ole days and the ole ppl in those ole days I know everyone grows up and grows apart but not us we always said we wont ever let anything come between us and I am going to still try hard and I will not let that happen even if I have to resort to my last option and I dont want to do that b/c then you two will hate me, and as much as I dont want you two to hate me I will do anything to see you two friends again b/c I miss us three and I know you two do also.   Love ya'   Jess

       Today I went to my sisters house b/c the cable guy was suppose to come by and he didnt but as I waited there I watched 50 first dates.  It is amazing how any little thing can remind you how much you miss your old boyfriend.  I just wish I had him here with me right now.  After I waited there like 5 hours I went home and when I got home the air conditioner wasnt working it like froze up or something but all I know is I broke a sweat just walking in the house it was hot, the carpet was hot.  I then watched tv and fixed the air and was ok I guess still not cool but getting there.  I watched Summerland, and OMG that show was so sad today and it made my mind wonder again about how happy I would be right now if I was still with Keith.  I know he is gone but I miss him more and more everyday it is not enough just talking with him on the phone every night before we go to bed I want to see him every night.  I just hope that one day I will truly be happy again and not trying to make myself happy just to put on a front with my friends.  This is prolly stupid and ppl are prolly like well you need to get over him but I dont care b/c they are not me.   Love ya'   Jess

       Today I clean my sisters house and then I came home and got on the net and talked to Sarah,  well she told me that Justin Brewer got in a car wreck and not alot of ppl like him so I was like o man that is so sad b/c even if no one likes him no one should ever want someone to get hurt.  She also said that a young african american kid about 13 years old was in the truck and he died.  I thought about it and it didnt really hit me that, that really happened I mean I thought that was awful and I cant believe that happened.  I went outside and ran a mile and then came in and took a shower that was still kinda on my mind some kid in alvarado just died today how could that happen he was a little boy prolly just havign fun why does he have to die.  Well I then went to pick up my little brother and him and my little cousin went with me to go get some apple pies.  When we got back my aunt called and asked to speak to my little brother and I thought something bad had happened b/c she nevers wants to talk to my little brother b/c she just talks to my mom so I just knew then that it wasnt good.  After my little brother got off the phone he came out of his room and you could tell he was crying so I asked him what was wrong and he said one of his friends just died and I knew that it was the kid with Justin.  I just heard from Sarah that one of the kids was the little boy who died (Bruce) brother was in the car too he made it well he is ok but when he found out his little brother died he lost it this is awful.  How would someone be able to live knowing that they survived and their little brother died.  Well I know that there is a reason for this but it is so hard to understand.  So please make time and pray for the other three who did survive the accident and for Bruces family they will need it.  Always drive safe and god bless Bruce and his brother and family and the other two.   Love ya'   Jess

       Today is my sisters birthday and she is 20 yrs old.  How cool is that when I was young I would have never thought of getting this old or knew what I would be doing when my sister was 20.  Well the sad thing is everyone grows up and moves on but on that note sometimes just when you thought you moved on something happens and you realize you didnt move and you dont know why the hell you would want to ever move on.  I know everyone prolly thinks I am mean and I make fun of ppl most of the time I do it just b/c I dunno bored and some ppl deserve it but there is one person who I talk about but I dont want to anymore I only did it so that I wouldnt worry about him and maybe it would make me feel better.  Well see my ex boyfriend and I broke up about a month ago it took me a little while to get over him and I had my great friend sarah who helped me along with alot of other ppl I guess and pt who is like a brother and would just make me laugh b/c all he wants to do is beat his a$$.  I love my friends.  My friends not my social ppl.  Well I broke up with my ex b/c I found out all this stuff and I didnt like it and I felt that no one should ever have to go through that.  Well we talked about everything and he made me feel like I was the one who was wrong about everything and he told me all that stupid stuff about how you know every guy will tell you they care and they love you and anything that will just make you feel happy or sad or whatever.  After that we decided to be friends and I was ok with that b/c he was moving and I figured you know what we would never see each other until he came back to visit we would just talk on the phone and that was cool.  My guy friends and Sarah made sure I had fun mostly every weekend b/c they are just great friends.  Well Sarah and I went to South Padre at the beginning of July and it was a blast so much fun you should go.  And as I was hoping that when I got back my ex would have already moved so I didnt have to see him I was also hoping that I know this is PATHETIC but that we would see each other and maybe get back together and I know that honestly that wouldnt happen b/c he is moving.   Well my luck he moved like the monday we got back from Padre and I was happy to hear he was gone well at least I acted happy to hear that b/c in a way I was and in another way I wasnt.  So then whenever I got around all my friends we started talking about him and stuff like that so I was feeling better and I was just single and having fun whenever I went out no worries.  Well about thursday night I went to go check my cell phone to see if anyone called me and no one ever does so I was so excited to see the phrase "1 MISSED CALL" on my phone, but when I looked to see who it was I dont know if I was excited or angry or scared to see that my Ex had called me liek 10 minutes ago.  So I decided whether or not I should call him back and me being the idiot that I am called him back.  We talked and he told me he moved and I said yeah I know and he said he was so sorry he didnt get to tell me bye and he misses me so much.  So I was like o dang it I just got over you well at least convinced myself that I got over him and then he said what are you doing tomorrow and I said just sitting here cleaning and he said well can I come see you and I didnt want to be rude so I said yeah.  Well then it was the next day and he came over talk about nervous I was so sick all day like butterflies in my stomach b/c I havent talked to him in about almost a month, like face to face.  Well when he got here I let him in and when we were together and if he ever came over we would sit together and watch tv well this time I sat on the floor like across the room and he sat in a chair on the other side.  We talked like we use to and acted like nothing had ever happened.  Neither one of us has either told each other how we still feel so we just acted like we were good friends and that is all.  Well he got ready to leave and I was about to walk him out and I knew this was going to be the last time I would ever see him again for awhile and I kept telling myself at least give him a hug.  And when we got to the door I was too scared as to what might happen, so he was kinda looking at me and he said can I "AT LEAST" have a hug and I said well yeah.  So we hugged and I then realized that I wanted a kiss so bad and I miss him so much more than I would have ever imagined.  Well I talked to him that night on the phone and we just talked about nothing particular and then I had to get up early so I told him goodnight and talk to him tomorrow.  Well tomorrow was here and we started talking and I asked him if he was nervous at all the other day at my house and he said kinda at the end b/c I wanted to give you a kiss and I knew then that I could never forget this kid he was my frist true love.  We talked and he said that he made the biggest mistake of his life letting me go.  And all that stupid crap that guys tell you he told me again and it just made me happy and sad and angry b/c I spent a whole month trying to get over him and now I am back where I started caring more and more about him and I dont know if I will ever stop loving him.  We were together for 1 yr. and almost 6 months.  I would have to say that was one of the best years and almost 6 months of my life.  If someone ever asked me when where you the happiest in your life and I would tell them when I was with Keith.  He may not have told me I was pretty the way other guys do I mean he did a couple times but the way he made me feel and the way he looked at me I could tell and that is all I needed to know.  We had some of the most fun together.  We made each other laugh and we always knew what each other was about to say or do.  I miss those days, but I know that nothing will ever be the same.  So I guess this time I really do have to move on and learn how to get over him and be without him.  I am just glad that I have the support of my friends there may not be many of them b/c I live in Alvarado and ppl here are fake I know I am but I do know who my real freinds are and I am satisfied with them.   Love ya   Jess
