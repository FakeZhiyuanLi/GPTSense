      I should be asleep, but I am not...instead, I am up just thinking about the past, present, and wondering what the future will hold.

      Concerned for the Future By Sandy Escobedo January 10, 2004, 1:19am New York, NY  	As I sit here and read through endless articles on Latino experiences coming particularly from those who are from LA, I can’t help but wonder, how “Latino” are my kids going to be?  I ask myself this because I am presently coping with the confusion one encounters when your passport reads “U.S. Citizen”, your parents are immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador, and you were born and raised in SOUTH EAST-LA, a part of LA that isn’t acknowledged enough.  Becoming cognizant of our multiple identities is both a blessing and a curse.  It is the complexity of our identity that makes us more interesting individuals, but it is that same complexity that makes it difficult for others to decipher who we are.  And when I say others, I mean everyone, especially we as “Latinos.”   	Like many “enlightened” Latinos, I had the privilege of receiving a college education.  I recently graduated from UCSB with a degree in Art History and two minors in French and History.  Because of my major, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Bordeaux France for a year and intern at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.  It is through these experiences as well as the course work I took that I formulated ideas on who I was.  I took a Chicano Studies class and found myself wondering whether I was a Chicana or not.  I sometimes I felt obligated to consider myself Chicana because I knew the flaws associated with the terms “Hispanic” and “Latino.”  Honestly though, I felt more comfortable, and in some way prefer the term Latino over Chicano.  My reasons are entirely personal and in no way would I want to impose my preferences and biases on others. 	I don’t consider myself Chicana because I don’t relate to what I SEE associated with Chicanismo.  I see Chicanismo, in context to LA, as associated with second or third generation Mexicans that were once from EAST LA who don’t speak Spanish and are too distant from being “Mexican.”  First and foremost, the immigration experience of my parents is recent and it is different from the families of self-proclaimed Chicanos.  My parents came to the U.S. in 1979; my dad from Mexico fleeing poverty, my mother from El Salvador fleeing the beginnings of the civil war.  My parents never worked in a field.  In fact, I had never seen farm labor until I encountered it on the 101 ventura freeway on my way to UCSB.  My parents instead began their life here in the service sector and now work in unionized jobs in which my dad earns a middle-class salary by working 12 hour shifts, at times, 7 days a week.   In other words, my parents are an example of meritocracy.  However, I understand that my parents have lucked out; they don’t.  They view that our success is attributed to all our hard work or as they would say “Bendiciones de Dios.” What they fail to see is that not every one with their background will achieve the so-called American Dream.  And because of this, my father nags at me all the time because I should be proud and not ashamed of being born in this country.  Thinking that I know it all, I just comfort myself by seeing him as a concerned parent.  Then I think about the future, and my own kids.   	For me, it is a must that my children speak Spanish.  It is a must that my children are advocates for social justice.  And most importantly, it is a must that they recognize that their socio-economic privilege is the result of their grand-parents “illegally” crossing the border to hustle in this country in give me a chance to reach my full potential.  And I fear that not happening and I fear viewing myself as a bad parent as a result of it.  But at the same time, is it fair for me to burden my children with such expectations knowing that they will be inevitably distant from my paisa experience no matter how much I try to imbed them in it?

      Life in the NYC certainly has taken its toll on me.  It is obvious by the title of this "blog" that I am an outsider to New York.  I was born and raised in South East LA and all of sudden, I find myself living here in New York, the Upper East Side to be exact, for almost an entire year.  The reason why I came here is to teach.  I teach a bilingual Pre-K class in the South Bronx and it hast got to be the toughest job I have ever had in my life.    The reasons why this job is so difficult I will sure to reveal in future blogs.  In the meantime, I chose to focus on why my time here in New York City thus far has been bitter sweet.  It has been bitter sweet for many reasons, some superficial, some most definitely quite the contrary.  Amongst the most superficial reason I can think of is the weather.  Can't it just be freakin' sunny for one day without there being a random snow or thunderstorm?!  A reason which is a bit more profound is that, although I am physically here in NY, I am mentally and spiritually somewhere else, and now, I am not sure it's California that I lack.  What I lack is some sense of stability; a sense of security which New York has certainly taken away from me.  More so, I have become a much more cynical and vengeful person while I have been out here. I think that it has to do with the fact that every freaking day, I am confronted with the realities of the injustice that is prevalent in the world as a whole.  What makes injustice particularly unique in the U.S. and in New York City is the following.  How could poverty be so severe in the richest country in the world and one of the richest cities?  What is worse, is the racial and gender polarization that is to be found when one juxtaposes the two side by side...  I find it especially problematic living in an affluent neighborhood in which I am often mistaken for a service worker.  Motherfu**ers livin' in this neighborhood have become so accustomed to seeing people that "look like me" serving them that they automatically assume that my presence in their space is not one cohabitation, rather, servitude.  I saw fu** them!  Yesterday I read an article in the New York Times that basically suggested, "If you believe in that meritocracy bu**sh**, for working 90 hours a week, you still get to be dirt poor, sexually harassed, wash clothes that you could never afford, and basically can't do sh** about it cause we'll call INS on you...WELCOME TO THE AMERICAN DREAM."  If it isn't obvious by now, I am pretty angry at the system in which we are forced to function in.  Perhaps for those that are a part of the dominant class, it is not so problematic given that they benefit from the exploitation of others.  But for me it is and something needs to be done.  That something will be explored in another post.

      I am in my graduate class right now and I am having a hard time trying to seem at least half interested.  This is straight out bu**sh**! I can't believe that it has taken me this long to realize that instead of doodling, I could be writing!  Oh writing, how I miss you so!  You are my one escape that won't abandon me, rather, I would be the one to abandon you.  You are my one escape that I could have at all times, without having to fear that you'll fu** up my health.  You are my one addiction that I don't have to join an "anonymous" group for!  I need to get my ish together and begin hustling again.  Every hustler has a game plan except me; thus, I need o start formulating mine.  I need to start reading the ECONOMIST and the WALL STREET JOURNAL!  I need to learn how to befriend the enemy, only to backstab him or her in the end...  It feels like I have been so detached from thinking critically, that I feel as though my ability to analyze, to a certain degree, has become mediocre.  I can't believe people actually participate in this class.  It is such an insult to my intelligence.  I feel like these fuc**ers just talk to show off and listen to themselves speak!  I'm scared to go back to real graduate school.  I have forgotten what it is like to actually produce though provoking papers and having endless discussions on identity politics...I need to learn how to be in a position of power and execute decisions that will create social justice...
