      I'm going to mail President Bush a big box of bracelets with, instead of the commonly used WWJD, the four letters WWJB. He can pass it out to his totally awesome (not to mention godly) staff, including ol' Donald Rumsfeld, John Ashcroft, Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and Paul Wolfowitz.  Think about it.  I'm sick of those crazy pro-war Christians. You can't be a Christian if you are pro-war. In the Bible somewhere, it said to love your enemies, and it also said that if someone slaps you, you should offer your other cheek so that they may slap it also. That's not a bad idea. Why don't we offer to them the chance to bomb the White House, too!

      Those crazy Christians are after me again, this time telling me that they're going to pray for me and such.   My response:  DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!  I don't want to be involved in a talk between a lunatic and an invisible entity. Really.  So leave me out of your "prayers," you nutjobs.

      I have encountered many Christians in my atheistic forums (they come to the forums to "show us the truth," and end up ruining the whole forum itself.  Well, we got into a political debate. They claim that America was founded on Christian principles and that it should stay that way. This means that gay rights shouldn't be allowed, atheism should be outlawed, etc.  You know what I tell these people? That's right: SHUT THE HELL UP!  I did some research, and it and let's take a look at the facts:  6 of the first presidents weren't Christians, starting with George Washington.  56 signers of the Declaration of Independence were not Christians  55 men in the Constitutional Convention were not Christians  38 Signers of the Constitution were not Christians  90 Members of the first Congress were not Christians  (I got this info from a Christian website, too... even though they were trying to depict these facts as false... however, I looked some stuff up and I even got real quotes. They are  not  out of context; ask and I'll give them to you.)  These should be clear enough to you Christian pieces of crap who want to take everyone but your own's rights away. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

      First of all, Satanism isn't what you probably think it is (the theistic approach of worshipping Satan). You can find about what Satanism really is  urlLink  here  .  Alright; here is what I think: It is purely an unintelligent "religion."  It follows many of my current beliefs such as atheism, but yet there are a few concepts that I just don't like. Here they are:   Violence & Revenge - First of all, I have to say that revenge is stupid. To "get back at someone" is just as bad as what that person did to you. If it does not benefit anyone, what is the point?  I'm also not too happy with their idea of violence. One of the rules of Satanism is to "destroy" someone if they persist in bothering you. I'm going to leave this up to you to decide. (I'm not even going to comment on this, as my ideas are obvious.)   "Carnal Desires" - Human nature is a horrible thing. It is our one huge weakness. This human nature gives us things such as lust for power and desires of sexuality. Satanism gives in to these things, saying that we are only animals and we should get accustomed to them. I, however, have to disagree. Why would you submit to your humanly desires if they make you more of an animal? We should strive for excellence, not submission to our faults.   Rituals - Satanic rituals are only for entertainment; however, they also involve sexual activities and "fetishes." My beliefs on this correspond with the section above this.  There are, of course, a few more problems I have with Satanism, but since I am not too familiar with the religion, I will not (and cannot) state these. For the next few weeks, I will state my problems with each and every religion (including Christianity, which I could write 20 pages on).

      You might be saying "What?" Well, it's true. I don't hate Bush. I don't love him either, but that's alright.   The real people I hate are his advisors (especially Karl Rove) and his staff (especially Rumsfeld).   I mean, he hardly can write his own speeches and I doubt he can even read. In fact, he said that his favorite book is   The Very Hungry Caterpillar ,  which is a children's book. My point isn't the fact that his favorite book is a book for kindergardners. My point is that  the book wasn't published until he was out of college . It's so funny. You can't help but to laugh. This is one of the reasons I don't hate Bush. It's cruel to hate a mental retard.   Here's another one: There is a website ( urlLink  here  ) that has more than 10 pages of hilarious errors of our current president. He's had so many errors in speeches and such that you can't help but feel sorry for the guy. It's especially sad that he's not even the one who writes his speeches; he just reads them... well, tries to read them. (He's even admitted that he asks his wife to read the briefings of CIA reports and such.) It's just so sad.  Lastly, I don't hate Bush because he does what I so often try to set out for: making a fool of the Republican Party. I mean, how does it feel to Republicans when the leader of their party is one of the most unintelligent people in the world? Pretty bad.  He also makes a fool of Christians, who he is also affiliated to. This is another one of my crusades... to make fools of the people who too often try to "show me the Way." Don't make me laugh, Christians, and don't make me laugh, Bush.  And, after all, he isn't the one who declared war and all that. It was his advisors. Bush can't think for himself, so someone else does it for him.  In conclusion, Bush makes me laugh, and people who make me laugh I do not hate.

      There is nothing to do in the middle of the night and early morning, so I suppose I'll put some stuff up that is pretty pointless.  For example, here's something that's pretty pointless:   My CD Collection (in alphabetic order by artist; remember that most of these are from my past non-nerdy life):      Faceless   by   Godsmack    [Self-Titled Album]   by   Korn    Take a Look in the Mirror   by   Korn    Untouchables   by   Korn    Reanimation   by   Linkin Park        Pork Soda   by   Primus    Sailing the Seas of Cheese   by   Primus    Life on Display   by   Puddle of Mudd    The Fundamental Elements of Southtown   by   P.O.D.    Hail to the Thief   by   Radiohead    OK Computer   by   Radiohead    The Bends   by   Radiohead    Toxicity   by   System of a Down    I now get my music from another source, so here is my song list from KaZaa Lite (again; some of these are from my past non-nerdy life, but I don't like to delete files):     Show Me How to Live  by  Audioslave      A Song for XX  by  Ayumi Hamasaki      Dearest  by  Ayumi Hamasaki      Evolution  by  Ayumi Hamasaki         Fly High   by   Ayumi Hamasaki    Immature   by   Ayumi Hamasaki         Naturally  by  Ayumi Hamasaki      Moonlight Sonata  by  Beethoven      Voodoo  by  Godsmack      Clint Eastwood  by  The Gorillaz      Fear of the Dark  by  Iron Maiden      Dead Bodies  Everywhere by  Korn      Freak on a Leash  by  Korn      Make Me Bad  by  Korn     Hot Dog   by   Limp Bizkit    My Generation   by   Limp Bizkit    Faint   by   Linkin Park    Numb   by   Linkin Park    Marriage of Figaro   by   Mozart    Amnesiac (Morning Bell)   by   Radiohead    Creep   by   Radiohead    Dollars & Cents   by   Radiohead    Karma Police   by   Radiohead    Knives Out   by   Radiohead    I Might Be Wrong   by   Radiohead    Idioteque   by   Radiohead    Pyramid Song   by   Radiohead    Four Seasons (Spring)   by   Vivaldi    Four Seasons (Autumn)   by   Vivaldi    ...and a lot of other classical music that you probably have no interest of.

      That's a very good question, as I am awfully busy reading about 400 pages a week. I read the best, and only the best books, thank you very much. Here are the books that I am currently reading (some of these are books I've been reading for months because, well, this is my summer vacation and I've not been reading as much as I should):   Atlas Shrugged  by  Ayn Rand    Einstein's Cosmos  by  Michio Kaku    Visions  by  Michio Kaku    Red Mars  by  Kim Stanley Robinson    Calculus Made Easy  by  Sylvanus Thompson & Martin Gardner   These books are all top notch, and you suggest that you check them out.

      I know why heaven and hell are so believable... it's a simple question. Well, here it is.  Someone from  physicsforums.com  made a pretty good point. This person said that he was speaking with a friend who recently had a close relative die. He was attempting to make her feel better, but didn't know how. However, he then thought of a myth he had heard: heaven and hell.  He proceeded to tell his hurt friend that her relative was now in heaven.  Now what can we see from this story? Well, for one, heaven and hell are used as comforts.  (You're probably saying to yourself that hell is not a comfort. I can explain this in one word:  justice . Go tell a Jew that Hitler is burning in hell and you'll see what I mean.)  Well, what I'm trying to say is that this myth of "comfort" caught on and transformed through  the years. It's easy... and you can't disprove it, which makes it even better. Awesome, huh?  It also provides a sense of hope that you don't completely die and your body continues to exist even after death. After all, if you eventually die on Earth, what is our purpose here? Well, there probably is no purpose except to provide progress of civilization... but what does civilization matter if the universe eventually ends.  Therefore, heaven and hell were created (in man's imaginations) for two main reasons: comfort (hope and justics) and purpose of life.  Q.E.D.

      Because of so much religious talk, I am compelled to create my own religion. More information soon.

       urlLink  Click Here!    Anyway, the article says this:   NORFOLK, Va.  — Religious broadcaster  Pat Robertson  ( search ) said Friday he believes God has told him President Bush will be re-elected in a "blowout" in November.  	  	 	  		    			 			 				    "I think George Bush is going to win in a walk," Robertson said on his "700 Club" program on the Virginia Beach-based  Christian Broadcasting Network  ( search ), which he founded. "I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout election in 2004. It's shaping up that way."   			 			   				   			 			 				    Robertson told viewers he spent several days in prayer at the end of 2003.   			 			   				   			 			 				     "The Lord has just blessed him," Robertson said of Bush. "I mean, he could make terribl  e   mistakes and comes out of it. It doesn't make any difference what he does, good or bad, God picks him up because he's a man of prayer and God's blessing him."    			 			   				   			 			 				     The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, a frequent Robertson critic and executive director of   Americans United for Separation of Church and State   (  search  ), said he had a prediction of his own: "Pat Robertson in 2004 will continue to use his multimillion broadcasting empire to promote George Bush and other Republican candidates."     I am seriously laughing so hard right now... Why are these people such idiots?!?

      Religious Status:  Atheist   Now I know I just probably scared half of you away, because most Christians look at me as if I am some crazy Satan-worshipper. I'm not.  I simply have seen no reason to believe in a God (or gods). There is no evidence whatsoever about this this religion except for that huge book called the Bible, which has not been proven. Anyway, since I am basically a science freak (mostly physics), I know that there are things in the Bible that really are not scientifically accurate, and because of this, I have to deny that the Bible is 100% (or any percent, for that matter) true.  I am an ex-Christian (or a backslider, as Christians would refer to me as). My de-conversion story is very similar to Douglas Adams'.  [Here is Douglas Adams' story: He was a Christian until the age of 13, at which he encountered an evangelist on the streets and recognized just how crazy the religion actually was... this is just a summary]  Anyway, these are my beliefs. I like looking into religious (especially religions such as Wicca, which are just weird), and I enjoy studying them. However, I'm just not religious because I think it is a bit over the edge.  If you would like to discuss this, I would be happy to.  I am affiliated with atheistic websites such as  urlLink positiveatheism.com , and I also enjoy looking at atheistic parody websites such as  urlLink landoverbaptist.org .  Enough about my religious beliefs. I'll get to some more interesting things later. Just wait.

      This year has been boring, awfully boring. Not much has happened these  past  few years, actually... well, besides a reign of a dictator, the creation of a PATRIOT Act that takes most of Americans' rights away, two horrible (one of these completely unnecessary) wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and... well, a lot of things.  These things surprisingly do not bother me. Why? It's because that they do not even compare to the things that are coming. All I can do to attempt to prevent these things is to pray to that invisible man in the sky... and that guy who was nailed to a tree 2000 years ago. Oh well.  Let's face it. There's nothing we can do to avoid the upcoming World War III, unless, of course, we took Bush out of office, but with all those damn Republicans swarming everywhere, that is going to be a very hard thing to do.  So this Blog is mainly just to convince Republicans to turn Democrat (or any party other than the Republican party). I will use pictures to show you, and I might include some videos also. That isn't all this is about, however. I will also post many of my scientific theories, along with my crazy philosophies. I might even add some lam}{0r humor in somewhere. This blog will be good... really good. I promise.
