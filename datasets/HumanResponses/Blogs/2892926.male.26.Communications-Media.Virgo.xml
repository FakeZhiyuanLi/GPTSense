      Well Nero Sun's gig was a very good time and the band sounded great. Although I do have an issue with the teasing of Highway to Hell and Back in Black. Don't start it if you ain't gonna finish it Wags. You know you can pull off Bon or Brian for one or two songs. If you missed the show last night-they'll be at Wicks on Friday, so show up and watch them jam.  On another band note, Hewett's band will be playing this Thursday at Gerstles in St Matthews. I believe the start time is 10 pm. So if you can take of Friday and that way you can see 2 shows on 2 nights.  I look forward to the partying.  Hope everyone is enjoying the weather, as I am stuck at work.

      It has been brought to my attention as to where I am getting my phrase "Trump Tight"?  My brother was the first person I ever heard use, so I assume he invented it.  I know a lot of people who use the word "tight" when something good happens. Therefore, when something is Trump Tight, it is very good, excellent, or awesome. I also assume that when the name Trump is put on anything it just makes it that much more recognizable. I just like the way it sounds, so that is why I say it.  As for me purchasing the Paris shirt there are a couple of reasons. First, I will buy other shirts if that one seems to be made well and the company is legit. Second, I think it is funny as hell. Third, I don't like Paris and I hope she breaks her leg or something so that the dumb, skinny bitch gets some karma back for all the shit she pulls.  Remember that  Nero Sun plays at The Hideaway at 10 pm tonight . So I hope to see some of yall there for a good time.

      Well no one responded, which is good, since I owe no one a round  tomorrow night at the Nero Sun show starting at 10 pm at The Hideaway.    Answers  1) "Kickstart My Heart" by Motley Crue 2) "Captive Honour" by Megadeth 3) "Highway to Hell" by AC/DC 4) "Talk Dirty to Me" by Poison 5) "Back in the Saddle" by Aerosmith  As Jesse Ventura said in Predator "Nothing but a bunch of God damn slack jawed faggots"  Someone needs to grow a pair and answer next time-those were easy.  Everyone have a good weekend. I am going to start closing up shop now.

      I say no problem to Wags or Hewett or anyone else I know for that matter, that is doing something that I can't, play music well in front of a group of strangers. I also say support our local music scene, because it helps our friends get more exposure from both local and national reps. It's always good hanging out get some grub, maybe some drinks, and watch your friends on stage singing some good songs. Plus if any of our friends get famous, more of a reason for us to get cushy jobs and some bling-bling.  3 hours to get your answers in biatchez hurry up!

      Well it is getting close to the lunching hour, I need to decide what to eat. Unfortunately, it's Lent and I am following the no meat rule, I have to figure out what is my course of action. Do I get the Burger King/McDonalds 2 for 2.22 or go to Moby Dick and get the Huggy Bear meal?

      How do I start this one off?  Well, I would classify myself as a middle of the road kind of guy on most things, not too liberal and not too conservative. Kind of a live and let live mentality.   However, I am really pissed off now that the FCC has taken my morning wake up tool away. Who the hell do they think they are? No offense to any of you, but if you don't like Howard Stern, then don't listen, no one forces you to set it on 100.5 between the hours of 6 am and 10 or 11 am. This is bullshit, big government coming in and telling me what's good for me. F OFF AHOLES!!, if I elected you then by God I can un-elect you. Nothing scares me like the government telling the citizens on what they can eat, read, sleep, etc. Is this Nazi Germany, Stalin ruled Russia, or Mao's China? I think Thomas Jefferson would have shot the SOB in charge of this whole damn thing.   Now to some of you who are ultra conservative, let me give you a good piece of advice. The government may be on your side now, but once this monster starts tearing up shit, it gets on a roll and is like Godzilla through Tokyo, it doesn't know or care who gets in its way. Just because they'll let you air the Jesus Love Hour now, doesn't mean that they won't come take it away later.  We as constituents, should fight this tooth and nail. Because it's like a roulette wheel, where it stops, no one but the government will know. It's like the Nazis, they came for the Jews, then the Slavs, then the rest of Europe. If you don't stand up for the principle, then they will eventually come for you and no one will be left to fight for your rights as a citizen.  If you don't like what's on TV or the radio then turn it off!!! Quit being a drooling moron that sits around and does nothing but treat that box like the golden calf. Read a book, go to a museum, use our park system. This is a point where Americans will continue to get dumber or will snap out of that trance that the box put them in.   I am not saying that anything goes, kids should be protected from certain things; however, the ruling body on that issue should be their parents. Maybe if the parents stopped watching American Idol long enough they would know little Johnny was in his room shooting up smack and playing Russian Roulette with a 44. Adults should be able to decide what they like and what they don't. Don't protest stuff, don't write or call people, just turn it off. Is it that hard to click the button on the remote these days?  I, personally, am going to call Ann Northup's office and remind her that I support freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Also I support the freedom to be an adult who respects others and can make up my own mind when it comes to my books, music, TV shows, and movies.  Man sometimes I think this country is turning into pussies. What happened to us?

      Okay, it's Friday, it's early and I will be lucky to see anymore daylight. So hear are some lines, see if yall know them. I will consider buying the winner a round tomorrow night at the Nero Sun show. How's that for shameless Waggs? You must name the song and group.  1) "Skydiving naked from an airplane or a lady with a body from outer space" 2) "You kill one man you're a murderer, kill many and you're a conqueror, kill many and you're a God" 3) "Hey Satan, paid my dues, playing in a rocking band, hey Momma, look at me, I'm on my way to the promised land" 4) "At the drive in, in the old man's Ford, behind them bushes till I'm screamin' for more, down the basement lock the cellar door" 5) "Bartender give me a drink, that's when she caught my eye"

      Honestly, it doesn't matter, since I have to work this weekend anyway.  Nero Sun is playing at Hideaway on Saturday-highly suggest everyone who is able to get off their asses and come see them play. Should be a good reason to get together, have a few, and listen to some good tunes. I don't know what time they start, but if anyone wants to put that in the comments section please do.  Lepus has the "terror level" thing on her site and I was thinking about how they should have one named after a character on Sesame Street. They wouldn't have to say blue-they could say Grover, green would be Oscar, yellow is Bert, orange would be Ernie, and red would be Elmo. I think that would be cool. What other colors are there?

      We just got in our baskteballs for March Madness-this is awesome, plenty of free time use with these.  I also saw "Barbershop" last night-very good movie with a lot of funny material. If you get a chance to see it I would recommend it.

      Check out Raul's site via the link on here. If we can get ILM to help us out on the real time, how Trump Tight would that be!  Well, it took me an hour, but I am all caught up on paper work-now I get to return bs phone calls to customers. That should provide me with plenty of fodder and material.

      Well I must say that I did the opposite of what I intended.   Me and my employees and manager get to the dinner at 6 for cocktails. I do some glad handing and the hit the bar, cutting off the CEO of the bank here in Kentucky in route. Luckily, he thought it was good I was getting "water" to which my manager rolled her eyes and said "don't over do the "water" " Well, I double fisted those and went through about 5 total, before they started the awards, speeches, and other babble. We then sat down for dinner, which was alright, but it gave us 2 hours to sober up before doing more drinking. I sat with my regional, the head commercial rep, the hot chick in mortgage, some really cute chick from Peru who works I don't know where, the easy chick from one of the banking centers that was hammered, and 3 other people. Dinner was good, because I listened to everyone else say stupid shit while I kept my mouth shut in fear of saying something that my regional would use against me later. We all left dinner and went to BW3's for the annual after party. That was fun not only because I went on a Jager/Rumplemintz Shots tear (4), I just kept drinking my vodka (4). I didn't get drunk though, which was wierd. Got a couple of numbers and sucked on a little face, but didn't get any nookie, which I was looking to get. The easy chick from the dinner had to be driven home, because she got too drunk. The chick from mortgage was sober and I think is intimidated by me. However, the chick from our loss prevention department thought I was realllly cute and so did her friend. One of the tellers from a banking center liked my hair cut, which led to more heavy petting.  Basically, I didn't do anything dumb, but I got to see a lot of other people do stupid stuff, which makes my pimp hand even more strong lol  Feel free to comment, question, and make snide remarks.

      Well I get up around 6:15, like normal and do my normal routine. Well I am getting ready and turn on the radio and only music is playing. Now I know you all are thinking I am crazy, but 100.5 always has Stern on and he is off now. Totally threw me for a loop, since there was no warning or explanation. I was really looking forward to having something positive to use to get through my meeting with my regional. However, first thing he did was give me kuddos for exceding plan last month. Trump tight for me 3rd in my region, which ain't bad considering my location.

      "I usually file that under R for toy"  "Well what is it"  "This, this is a penis stretcher..wanna try it out?"  I have the movie Real Genius on my mind. Of course that movie has hundreds of great quotes. I am getting ancy, don't know why. I do know I have women on the brain today, that means I have recovered a full 100% from last weeks illness.  My regional continues to spit out emails like one of those number machines at the return counter at Target. This guy is doing less today than I am and I make maybe a fourth of what he does.  If I ever get a hold of the higher ups salaries I am publishing them in the Courier Journal in the adds section and then let everyone I know in on it. That would be a wrench in the works.

      Well since the great Raul, who is highly hopped up on medication, is saying we have gone from mentally challenging conversations to low brow gansta talk.  I personally think that Hamlet is one of Shakespeare's finest works. Although it is in question whether or not he wrote it. Regardless it is a fine piece of writing and makes me believe that everyone has one great story in them and if it gets published enough will last more than 100 years.  How about that one.

       Blowing up da spot!!   Just haven't heard anyone say it in a while, so I figure I would.  Anyway the answer to yesterday's lyric was by Ice Cube aka OShea Jackson off the Album Lethal Injection, the song is called Creep. Very cool getting drunk or high at 4 in the morning type song.  I have now gotten 6 confirmations of very attractive semi loose bank women that will be there tonight. Let's see if I can get the magic to happen.

      Yes, I know it is not lunch yet, but tonight is the bank's Employee Appreciation Dinner. The office is a buzz and everyone is happy about getting free drinks and a free dinner, which is catered. I, as always, am looking forward to free eats. As for drinking, we'll see how the stomach can do. I am sure the after party will be at BW3's or Saints. I suspect that there will be some loose bank women around. Hopefully, I'll see if the Rhino can pick up one of the lovely ladies ;)

      Well kiddies let's talk about what's going on in the news.  I think it is sad that this country doesn't have 3 or 5 parties which have a strong showing every year. I mean if you still believe that the Democrats and Republicans vary that much when it comes to giving a damn about us, their constituents aka their bosses, then I guess you still leave your fallen out teeth under pillows thinking some fairy will come and drop off money and whisk your tooth or teeth away. The fact is both the Republicans and Democrats are a bunch of money and power hungry bastards that could give a rats ass if we all live or die, as long as they get elected and can vote themselves a pay increase for dealing with the hassle.   Speaking of which, that is a very big problem that we, as Americans, are seriously lazy when it comes to getting our reality TV soaked fat asses off the couch and down to the polls, which take all of about 5 minutes. If you are a registered Republican, Independent, Green Party, etc. here in Kentucky it takes you a minute and a half on the primaries, believe me I timed it, and it would have been quicker if it hadn't been for the bitch at the scanner. I know the whole system needs to be over-hauled when it comes to term limits, campaign spending, etc., but let me try to stick with the current rant at hand.   The party with the Jackass as a logo and their rage against good old Ralph Nader. For those of you who didn't know, Ralph fought the big 3(GM, Ford, Chrysler) back when they were probably the biggest lobbyist group in the country and could have you killed for giving them any kind of hastle, let alone the kind Ralph gave them. Nader stood up to them regarding car safety and some other issues. Now Ralph might not have the full deck of cards, but he brings with him and honesty that you should get from an elected official. I have never heard anyone who has ever really known him speak ill of him. I have always heard good things of him as a public servant, notice the word servant and how it mainly applies to us, their bosses now? The Democrats worry Ralphie boy will swing votes, hell if they keep bitching they will give him enough free air time that he could swing a lot of votes from both sides. The Democrats realize that John Kerry has about the personality and the looks of my computer keyboard and makes Al Gore look cooool. That scares them, since many Americans are shallow and would vote for a more physically attractive candidate and worry about their views later. Kennedy versus Nixon in 1964 anyone?   The Democrats are sinking and it is really scaring the holy hell out of the old timers. Their registrations are down in most states i.e. younger voters are registering a different party. People don't associate them like they used to as "working hard for the American worker, because that's what I am". They worry that people just view Kerry as the "Democrat version of Bush", so if things will be the same, why change horses. I could go on and on with reasons, but basically the Democrats worry their "boy" doesn't have the power, charisma, etc to pull off a head to head battle with George Wubba.   I never remember seeing, but it is possible it happened, this much press after Bush Sr. lost in 1992 regarding Perot. I think the Democrats can't believe that they lost in 2000, that their chance at 16 years in the white house was washed down the toilet to the swamp down in Florida. I guess the Democrats just worry that there could be another 12 years of Republicans at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and that really perturbs them.  The whole political system in this country is really messed up and away from what the founding fathers wanted. I just want more people to vote, then I'll worry about people being more informed when they vote, then I'll have to work on an overhaul. I think having Ralph Nader in the mix is great for this country because it will do what most Americans don't want to THINK! Once Americans do start to think who knows what good things we could do and then shit we could get accomplished.  I am not saying I will vote for Ralph, because I honestly probably won't, but I fully encourage anyone who does want to vote for him to do so. Hell, I'll encourage anyone to vote, even if they do vote for Kerry. People forget that if we don't use stuff the government creeps up and takes it away, so if more and more of us don't vote there could be a day when that trillion dollar monster, which takes up about 2 square miles in between Maryland and Virginia, called our government could take it away.  Thank you for thinking and your continued support. I am going to see if we are closer to catching that SOB Hismamma Ain't Binlaidinawhile. I hope we catch that @#$!%@*@#%$@*&#

I put the pedal to tha floor, in my two toned Ford Explorer."  Have fun with that.

      Some people that I work with here in town, not directly in my office. Should be drug in the street and beat with broom handles. I swear they are so GD perky it's just gut wrenching. I finally feel that this bug is out of my system, when I get some fluffy, cutesy, email from some dumb bitch, who is lucky if she can tie her own shoes. To top that one, my regional manager thinks "current" is spelled "currant". Does this dipshit know how to use spell check or what? Makes me want to puke all over the place.  I have decided to go to the gym today and just do weights and no carido, until my stomach is back 100%. I feel as though I am teaching it how to eat 3 squares again. It's weird not being hungry. The only time I notice is when my stomach knots up, because I haven't eaten in hours.   There was a program on the E channel last night about how stars, women and men, do crazy things to loose unhealthy amounts of weight. I thought I was going to die, by basically not eating for 3 days, and I only lost 6 pounds. I couldn't think of doing that on a continued basis and still do all the things that I do.  The weekend was fun and low key. I enjoyed the GI Joe Film Festival hosted by Raul and then going on a putt-putt excursion to the Beer Depot. If anyone who reads this has never been, go. Nothing better than trying to win money off of your drunken friends at a bar playing putt-putt. Located off of Frankfort Avenue, the Beer Depot is a good low key spot to hang out and play a Championship Game of 9 hole putt-putt for free.  Trump Tight.

      Well since everyone is on a big part of my heritage kick, I figured I would make a decent posting of it.  I do have a problem with my Viking name, because I would have liked to have a better animal selection to choose from like a tiger, war eagle, or something very nasty.  I got home last night from working a 12.5 hour day, fired up the oven slid in a pizza and luckily Donnie Brasco was on, which I have never seen all of the way through. I sat down to watch the movie and in my head I kept thinking about all of the Viking talk that came up yesterday. My grandmother, who died in 2002, was 100% Swedish, thus making my father half Swede, and lil ole me a good solid quarter.  I was thinking on how much of each of my parents and my grandparents I have in my facial features and how much the quarter Swede has influence my body type, skin pigmentation, hair, etc. I just think how cool it is that most Americans have the luxury of having so many different cultures in their genetics, how much heritage we all have. Yesterday really makes me think how little I do know about where everyone, being my great grandparents, etc. came from and how each of their original countries has developed into making me, and how I have a part genetically, physically, and characteristically as a part of me.  That all being said, after coming into work and seeing my regional's bs email. The Viking in me wanted to find the nearest battle axe, bullwhip, take over a long boat, and have my staff row me over to his office, where I could plunder, pillage, take everyone away in chains, and then torch the place. I would have to decide if I wanted to use the "Blood Eagle" on someone. In all honesty, the "Blood Eagle" has got to be more foul and perturbing than Vlad the Impaler scaring hordes away by impaling people on 20 foot poles leading to his castle.  I'll stop ranting now. Hope everyone is having a good Friday and will have a kickass weekend.

      Due to the fact that I am a quarter Swede, I decided to look up my Viking name off of the link on Ramble's site. So here is what I found out.  Petr Oakenwulf  Fearsome Viking, but is not completely uncivilized. The other Vikings make fun of you for that. You thrist for battle and tend to strike first and think later. (So far so good) You're not a "berserker", but you among the toughest sane Vikings around.  You possess some skills which other Vikings respect, though in your case the respect is tinged in with fear.  You have a fairly pragmatic attitude towards life and tend not to expend effort in areas where it would be wasted. You sometimes come off as a bit of a snob-Vikings aren't snobbish people-they like you or they kill you, so try to be more like a Viking.  Pretty on target-anyone else got a thought about it?

      If any of yall haven't seen it, I strongly suggest watching The Chapelle Show on Comedy Central every Wednesday night at 10:30. He has got to be one of the top 5 comics of the last 10 years. Very funny guy and he does a better white guy impression than Eddie Murphy.  Rick James "Charlie Murphy, I have a new joke for you. What did the 5 fingers say to the face?" Charlie Murphy "What?" Rick James "SLAP" and proceeds to smack Charlie Murphy in the face  "I'M RICK JAMES BITCH!!!"

      Alright now kiddies, it's a learnin' we will go with Rhino teaching the class.  RBX is a rapper out of LA that came out on Dr. Dre's first solo release "The Chronic", which is a rap album classic. RBX was famous for the line "I drop bombs like Hiroshima"  RBS is a term I came up with, and Jen figured out how to place on the site, that can mean many things-pick whatever you want:  Random Bitching Session Random Bitching Site Random Bullshit Session Recent Bitching Stuff  etc, etc.

      While in my state of what I like to call "The Quill" I saw probably one of Seinfeld's funniest episodes and probably one of the greatest quotes in a sitcom of all time. Let me set it up.  Jerry wants to get Uncle Leo to move back in with his girlfriend, so that Jerry's parents move out of Jerry's apartment and back into Uncle Leo's pad. Thus creating more than a 2 foot buffer zone. Jerry asks Uncle Leo out to lunch to try to convince him to move back in.  Jerry "If you can find any woman that can stand your presence for more than 10 consecutive seconds, then you should cling to her like creeping death, which might I add is not far behind you"  Uncle Leo "But she's an Anti Semite?"  Jerry "Can you blame her?"  I really miss that show and wish it would have stayed on the air a few more years. For a show about nothing, it was great.

      Well, I did take 2 shots of NyQuill and hit the sheets around 9 and I am still not 100%. I am starting to get pissed that my body is not crushing this virus with it's normal authority. Maybe I need to call in the riot police, the tear gas, and the dogs? However, I did have to work a 10 hour day yesterday and a 12 hour one today, so the lack of just being able to rest is potentially slowing down my recovery. I hate being ill. No, not like the Beastie Boys or Big Daddy Kane, ill as in sick. I am 85% right now, which is at least 50% better than Tuesday when I felt and looked like walking death. Everytime I moved around I wanted an announcer to say "Dead Man Walking" just for effect.  Anyways, work, as expected and much to my benefit, is slow right now. I am hoping this trend continues so that I can just sit at my desk, do some paper work, and not have to deal with any customers directly.

      Well I feel as though I got something accomplished in creating this thing and I guess we'll see how it goes. I must now retreat to wherever Rhino's go at night to sleep. I figure 2 or 3 shots of Nyquill and this flu bug will be DIMS(dead in my system)  Peace out Safari Dwellers

      Having the stomach flu has one good side effect-losing weight. So far today I have eaten 2 pieces of toast and half a bag of Lay's regular Potato Chips, along with probably a half gallon of water. Should be interesting to see what the scale says when I get home

      Is anyone else sick of this toothpick skank running around, due to the fact that the media has the attention span of Dick Gephardt's Presidency run? I don't find her attractive and am annoyed this brainless twit is worth millions. I say take all her money away and we'll see how many people like to hang out with her. One of the few people I would love to see be a mute. Although a mute would have something intelligent to say. If I ever get the chance to meet her I will make sure I have a roll of duct tape on hand to wrap around that empty bony head of hers.

      Well here we go. The dawn of a new era. A Rhino using technology to do nothing but be monitored by work and potentially the government. I really did this so my friends can laugh with or at me. I hope to just put on little tid bits of bs and other assortments of babble, thus giving even more of a headache to the general public.

      Well, I get out of the gym and I knew I had to do 2 things:  1) Replace my AC/DC album "Who Made Who" The thing wouldn't play in my car and the time that it did play I made a deal with God I would by a new one if he would just let the cd player let it play "For Those About to Rock" Once it played, I knew I had to ante up. 2) Find a CD rack for my big collection of cds.  So I stop by Circuit City-who had jack shit by the way. However, they did have the AC/DC album for $12 and lo and behold a light shined down from the heavens and a voice said "This is Good" Not really, but it was a Quiet Riot Greatest Hits album for $6. I couldn't pass it up. It's in my car in the changer right now. I then go over to Best Buy. I walk around for about 2 minutes and there it is 486 cd rack, dvds, tapes, blah blah. 486 CDS-I knew I could use this thing, plus it was on sale for $45-so I grabbed it and took it to the check out. Now here is something humorous. I am a big guy, not fat, not thin, not all muscles, but still above average in size. Well I go to an open lane, unsling the rack off my shoulder and lean it up where the 12 year old waiting on me could scan it. He says "Sir you really should have gotten someone to help you with it" Now in no way did I think that thing was heavy or awkward, so I look down at the box weight-25 pounds. So I look at the kid as I hand him my card and say "It only weighs 25 pounds" to which he replies, after looking me up and down, "Oh...well...it still might have been a good idea" I really felt like telling him I warm up on bench press what he weighed, which couldn't have been more than a buck 35, a buck fifty-tops.  I then went home, built the rack, and installed all of my music into their new rack. It is very Trump Tight and I am very content on the local and look of the rack. Granted it is black and all my other furniture is tan or brown in color it still looks very good. I was very pleased when it was all said and done.

      Well it looks like our boy is on a roll with his new, as Labowski would put it, "lady friend". I was up at Wicks last night and it was good to see Church cuddling and canoodling with an attractive woman who is quite smitten with him. Now don't take me wrong-they were just sitting there snuggling in the booth, nothing major or crazy PDA.  Quick condo update, I am getting all of my personal effects up. I still need to get frames for my Muhammad Ali Posters, so I can get those tacked on the wall. Off course if I didn't have to work open to close yesterday, today, and tomorrow, I might be able to get more done. I am getting back in the gym tonight, I have to. I checked the scale yesterday and I am up to 237. Very unacceptable in my eyes, so I have to go today, tomorrow and this weekend and just keep at it.  Well, I need to get off and get some loan closings ready to roll. Talk to yall later.

      If yall didn't catch the Dave Chapelle Show last Wednesday-you seriously missed out.   I was cleaning some stuff up around my condo when the re-run came on and I keep busting a gut when Dave does his rendition of Sesame Street called Knee High Park. Basically, the 2 funniest parts are when Charlie Murphy aka Tha Darkness according to Rick James, is the voice of an Oscar the Grouch character. He sings a song called "I say fuck it" The best line starts off with "I make love to my hand" and ends with "I smack my dick like it owes me money" I will never be upset again as long as I keep hearing that loop in my head. The next funny thing was Q-Tip and the VD puppets singing about what each VD did. That got brought up because the puppet voiced by Snoop said his penis hurt and it burned when he took a wee-wee. The shocking thing was that a muppet penis was shown.  Seriously watch it. It is kinda shocking, but it is funny as hell to see muppets gone awry.

      Well, Cincy was a good time. Actually, we were in the Newport area-very good time. Pate, Fugi, Blackstock, and the rest of the guys send their regards and wish more of yall could have hung out.   Me and Pig got to the hotel around 8:30 and had a drink with everyone while watching the games. Damn Eddie Satan and Oklahoma State-that son of a bitch. Anyway, we walk down to this German Bar, which was actually like a German Beer Garden and had a blast. Tom Beck is engaged now, I think they are planning the wedding date to be in January. Chris's new girlfriend is a sweetheart, I'm glad for him, she is a really cool chick to hang out with. Blackstock was in great form, as always with the quips.   Yall should have seen the size of these beer glasses-for 7.50 you got this monster glass with God knows how much beer in it. I myself went for the big phat Viking goblet or urn of Makers and Coke for $5.50. Dude is was Trump Tight on how much Makers got put into that thing-I just watched in awe as the bartender poured the bottle upside down and dumped half of it into my glass. We also ordered some soft freshly baked pretzels with cheese dip-now that was a tasty meal. There was a bachellorette party there and let's just say Blackstock and myself are on some good pics deflowering the bride on the table. Everyone got a good laugh out of it. We left there and went back to the hotel to discuss what to eat, and then it was said "WHITE CASTLES".  Now we have all been here before, you know you shouldn't, but for just .69 you can get a lovely warm cheeseburger, french fries for .89, I mean it is so tempting and tastes so good. The only problem is the aftermath after you eat them. I am just glad I was not staying in the hotel, because that place is gonna reak today. My stomach wasn't too thrilled with me this morning-ouch.   After eating and giving my good byes, I drove Pate and Melissa back to their car and then headed back to Louisville. I left there at 3:45 and got home at 5:00, so not too bad. I am very tired today. Oh well, back to work tomorrow and Trivia tomorrow night. Who's in??

      Like straight out of the f-ing movie "A Bronx Tale"  Let me rewind for a bit.   Jay has people over last night for a supposed cookout. I say this because it was just a night if drinking, basketball, drinking games, and some cat fighting-but I digress.  I am talking to this chick, Rhonda, who works for the same company I do, on Thursday night and she wanted to do something on Friday, so I suggested going over to Jay's with me. Friday I told her I would call her and we would figure out a time to meet up and go over there.  I was running some errands i.e. picking up stuff from Home Depot and getting some booze, when I called Rhonda to ask how she wanted to do the driving thing over to Jay's to hang out. She said she would just meet me somewhere and follow me to Matt and Jay's. Well we agreed on a spot, I ran home, cleaned up and got over to the spot right on the dot, she was already waiting when I pulled up-pretty good sign-a woman on time. So I pull up next to her car and asked her if it was okay if I stopped at McDonald's, because I hadn't eaten in a couple of hours and I was hungry. She said that was fine, but she wanted to know if she could ride with me.   Now pause with me for a second here, kindda like in Goodfellas, for about a second my brain is wondering why this very introverted chick, who originally wanted to follow me out there, now wants to ride with me? I know I am not the brightest crayon in the box or good at reading signals from women, but I took this as a good thing. Okay we can unpause now.  So she gets in the car with me, we swing by McDonald's, and head over to Jay's. Let's just say she had a few things to say about the way I drive. Of course as you all know, I do drive faster than most people and don't always go the normal route that others go i.e. through a parking lot versus using the street. I promise to get a racing harness put in for the 4 passenger spots in my car in the near future. We get over to Jay's and she asks me again if I told Jay or Matt that she was coming with me. I think she was nervous for a couple of reasons:  1) She probably thought all my friends were just like me, which I had already told her was untrue, I said us collectively are very eclectic, but have some similar base qualities. 2) Hanging out with crazy white people. It's like us going down to Valley Station or PRP, it will make you nervous. 3) Sometimes, I make people nervous. I am big and say crazy stuff sometimes.  I just walk in, to which I hear her say as I start bellowing my intros-"Aren't you supposed to knock first?" I introduce Rhonda to everyone present, which at the time was 5 people. Night stayed low key, the games were good, the Polar Bear Vodka was pretty good, and the drinking games were funny to listen in to.  The guys there had this to say: "She's really cute, fun to hang out with, seems pretty smart, but she doesn't talk a lot"  True, she seems very introverted, but considering it was the first time hanging out with us, I am not surprised. Plus, most chicks I go out with talk as much as me.  We leave for the night after Duke and Wake seem to have their games locked up. Well we walk to my car and I hit the unlock button and open her door. So once she is safely in, I hit the lock button, just to see what would happen, but the horn goes off, so I hit the unlock button, because that was very obvious and not smooth at all. Well, I barely clear the bumper of my car and she had reached over to open my door.  Guys understand something and women- take some notes , it is very rare for that to happen. In all of the dates I have ever been on in my life, or times I ever had women in the car taking them anywhere, a woman reaching over or just hitting the unlock button,so I could get in the car without unlocking it, had only happened twice before last night. I mean that was major in my head. Here is some chick who is maybe 5'2 and weighs barely a buck, reaches over and opens my door. I'm shocked and just impressed. So ladies, I know yall judge us with your little check list, well that is one of ours.  Anyway, I am not sure how to read this chick. Rhonda will be a challenge, because she doesn't talk a lot and is very guarded about what she lets out. I'm up for it. I did get a hug before she left to get back in her car. I am hoping I get to take her out tomorrow night, but we'll see about that. Yall know me and trying to get a chick out on a second date-easier said than done.   I leave for Cincy once I get off work, so yall have a good one tonight and stay safe-I'm out.   Bobby D

      Well tonight I think the plan is to hang out at Jay's for a cookout. I think Rhonda may come out and hang out, she works for the same company, just at a different location. Tomorrow night I am going to Cincy to see some friends, hope yall can handle holding down the fort.

      My manager calls me and tell me she needs me to pick up her business cards and run them down to her. Well I do that and to my surprise there are some really good looking chicks down there at the JTown Expo. All of the businesses that want to, get a booth and them they can pitch products to different people that walk by. Well, one of our MPS reps was there and I shot the shit with her, she's cute, but she's 38 and it's kind of weird when she hits on me. Anyway, there was a really cute chick at the Ferd Grisanti's booth. I signed up to win a free dinner for 2. I did win a free golf ball set from them. There was also this chick Julie who Hewett knows because she is friends with that model chick. I didn't talk to her, because she's only met me once or twice. She is very cute and she reminds me of Robin Givens-yum. I was walking by one isle and this really athletic blonde from Wagner Electrical wanted to know if I would check out they're display and talk to her since they were slow. Jeez, let me think-stop and talk to a hot blonde-hmmm. Very nice, can't remember her name for the life of me. We probably talked for 5 minutes until my manager found me and ruined my flow-lol The positive is that the blonde knows where I work and I hope she stops by and visits ;) Then there was this easy looking chick from TMobile that tried to convince me to change my wireless service. I told her I was quite happy with Cingular and was not switching anytime soon. She tried everything from rubbing up against me-at the 5/3 booth, to leaning over booth ways so I could get a good shot or her ass and cleavage. The cops and firefighters thought that was funny,   I got a lot of free novelty stuff that I gave to my staff; however, I kept the golf balls. Lata playas

      I am sitting here working, when one of my staff tells I have a call on the line. I didn't think anything of it, since we get calls all of the time from other banks. It's some lady on the phone saying that my payment is late on my Visa. First of all, I don't miss payments, never, I didn't almost get an 800 credit bureau score by being a dead beat. Anyway, I flip out completely, asking what has been charged, etc. Then something in my brain thinks this might have been bs. So I give her my new address and call the customer service line back. It seems that someone back in January changed my address from my condo to somewhere out in Kansas. I have them shut the card down due to exposure and find out what the deal is. The lady wasn't quite sure who authorized the address change, but that she could fax me a copy. I am waiting to see who in the #$%@#$^%#$ hell thought they were smart enough to #$# around with me. Now my account with them is lit up like a Christmas Tree. I have put some bells and whistles on, so next time if someone gets funny, they're screwed.  I hope to god I find whoever did this, because if they're not in jail or already dead, they are going to wish that they were.

      Man am I tired and I don't even know why-well sort of. I have been waking up early lately and I can't figure it out. It's not like I get out of bed, but I know that I am not fully asleep either. I need to get this resolved or I am going to crash and burn.  Any who, I did do some shopping for the crib yesterday-new light fixtures, screwdriver set, a box of nails, floor headers, etc. I am going to forsake my gym duty today and go shopping for bed stuff, a couple of lamps, etc. I need to get fitted for some new suits, which I should have done yesterday, but it just didn't work out. I need to get in gear, but shit with work, the fraternity, etc, etc.   I'm still tweaking the e.c to figure out what will go best where i.e. PS2, VCR, etc.  I'm out-I think I am going to go take a nap.

      Well, I got a lot of stuff done this weekend that I thought I wasn't.  Jay, Church, and I went up to Molly's on Friday to watch U of L's collapse. However, it was good since there were 2 hot ladies that I had never met before that I got to converse with and switch digits with. The one that ended up giving off the vibe, was the one that I originally thought wasn't interested, due to her being quiet and on the phone for some time at the beginning. It all worked out, had a good time and went to bed at a reasonable hour.   After working a Blitz here for the bank on Saturday, I got home, conversed with my brother, and then went out to eat with Waggs and Anthony. Once we got finished eating, Anthony stops at KMart, to which me and Waggs were trying to figure out why the f we were there. Well Anthony said we were going to see if we could find an entertainment center for my pad. Of course I scoughed at the idea and said we would have a better shot of finding gold in a piece of dog shit. Well, we get back to the isles that have home furnishings and sure as shit there is a really good looking one from O Sullivan's that is on sale. It always happens this way, Anthony says something, everyone says it's bullshit, and in the end he's right. We eventually got a truck and picked up the entertainment center. Waggs decides to get the thing out and start working on it. After about 15 minutes, Anthony says, hey since we have the truck, why not go get a TV. I agreed and we went to Circuit City and spent about as much time in there as a McDonalds Drive Thru. I found the TV I had been looking at and had it in the back of the pickup in less than 10 minutes. Yeah I know most of the time you don't spend 10 minutes in the drive thru, but it was  very quick for picking up a larger size TV. Well, it all got done and we all got to watch some games on the new flat screen. Went up to Back Door after that, hung out, got some food and some drinks and just chilled. Thanks again to Waggs and Anthony for helping me do that.   Sunday, was family day. My Aunt was in town from NYC, so my other aunt had everyone over for dinner. It was a great time. My cousins brought their kids and we had a good time playing around, good food, good conversation. My Dad's side of the family is very artsy and pretty well read, so the conversation is usually pretty good, plenty of good stories, and a lot of laughs. It was good to see everyone and have a good time.

      Just wanted to thank Will, Hewett, and Arru, for helping me, over the last several weeks, pick up and move furniture into my place. After much issue with getting the head board for the bed, it is now safe and secure inside the lair. I plan on getting the entertainment center and TV this weekend and officially moving into the condo. I really appreciate you 3 helping me and I am glad I have a bunch of friends that want to help me with moving stuff. I can't believe how many people have offered to help out, very glad that I have the friends that I have.  The headboard is cool, it is just in a really big box, so when Hewett went with me to pick up the stuff yesterday, it wouldn't fit, so I had to go back today with Arru and yank that SOB into the truck to move over to St. Matthews.  Tonight the word is the new BW3's off Bardstown Rd in the Highlands for the U of L game. I think 9 pm or so people should be filtering in. Come on out and hang out-should be a very good time.  Last night me and Anthony went around seeing if I could find the elusive entertainment center that had what I needed. I didn't find an entertainment center, however, I did find 2 good movies in the 2 for $11 pile at Wal Mart. The first one was "Wild Things"-yummy and "Airheads"-funny as hell, couldn't resist spending the dollars to get them.  By the way Trump Tight is a great phrase to those of you still confused by it's use and meaning. If something is tight, it is cool or really good. Trump, is of course the last name of millionaire Donald Trump. Thus if something is Trump Tight, it is very good. Let me use it in a sentence.  "I can't wait for the new GTO to come out, because that ride looks Trump Tight"  I am glad I got to drop some knowledge today. See yall this weekend.

      Well, I didn't go out and party like everyone else did. I went to the gym after work and got in a  very good work out, not as extensive as I wanted, but it was good to be in there for an hour and a half doing cardio and weights.  I did hang out with Waggs, Raul, and Lepus last night at Dark Star, sorry yall if I wasn't more fun, but it was nice to see you all and hang out for a bit. It was very good to see Lewis. I don't think I have seen him well over a year or so, but he is still Chef. Dark Star had a great vibe to it and I would recommend it for next year. If I had drank, those $2.00 16 oz of Killians would have been a good deal. I did enjoy walking up to and from Dark Star, which is at most 3 blocks from the rents.   On the way back it was a nice walk, I just thought about how Louisville really did have an Irish feel that night, weather wise. Even though I did not go out and party, it still was a very good St. Patty's Day. Of course my train of thought was in fact broken by a train. Frankfort Avenue has never turned into Bardstown Road is because a rail line goes right down the side of it, this preventing more crap from popping up. Well, I figured if I ran the last block and a half, I could cross at the light and beat the train. That was a mistake thinking a Rhino was faster than the train. I looked back and realized that if I didn't take the opportunity and run across the tracks, that I would be stuck for God knows how long. So with about a 30 yrd difference between me and the train I crossed in the grass and used the side street to get home. The conductor looked out his window at me when he passed, thinking that I must be crazy, drunk, Irish, or all 3 to pull that stunt.   Today I go and get my headboard, for my bed and hopefully, get the finishing touches completed on my condo. How Trump Tight would that be to finally be completed with this home ownership project?

      I am quite envious of the people who are off today in order to celebrate a great American Holiday. I agree with the Guinness add, that it should be a National Holiday, but jeez, that would create a lot of craziness, God knows we're a wee bit better than the Irish.  Anyway, since everyone is probably going to be going out drinking today and tonight, I figured all you drinkers should (in my best Irish Catholic Priest Voice) "Bow your heads and receive God's blessing"   An Irish Blessing    May the road rise to meet you, may the wind always be at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face and the rains fall softly on your fields. And, until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of his hand.   (Irish Catholic Priest Voice) "Now go out there ya bunch of Hooligans and drink one for ole' Ireland, and don't let me catch ya doing any of your shenanigans near the rectory"  Raise your glasses, say a prayer, and make a toast-Happy St. Patrick's Day

      Let me tell you about trivia last night. It gets moved from Flanagan's to OShea's, which to me was not a great way to start things off, since I am not and OShea's fan. I kind of took that as a bad omen. However,  The team of "Touched by a Drunken Monkey" aka Church, Will, Giz, and myself, did a veni, vidi, vici and smacked the crap out of everyone, winning by a solid 8 points. We rocked every bonus question, including the last one for 15 points. I only contributed 2 answers, but it felt awesome to put the smack down across the bar and win. I would say we were all pumped about getting $50 for next week. The one quote common for all of us after we won was "We're getting ripped next week". Next week the team name will be the following for those who show up:   "Geek,Dweeb,Spaz, Matt Church is the one with the $50 gift certificate!"   Besides winning we had a good time using the music selection to make new songs featuring the Baron.  Remember St. Patty's is tomorrow and I believe Raul is kicking things off at his place around 10 or 11 am. That should be interesting come 5 pm  lol  Lata playas

      Remember tonight up at Flanagan's is trivia night. We need to do a much better job this week and try to hit the top 3. We've done well in the first two rounds every other week, but we need to get a solid team together to crack up into the top 3. So if you can, please come out and play some trivia, eat some food, and hang out with your friends.  Lata playas

      Almost forgot, since I know some of yall didn't show up last night. The ladies I called did not come hang out last night. Honestly, if you all think my powers of persuasion had stepped up that much, you need to seek professional help.  Amanda never called me back, so I don't know what her and Erin did. Sarah didn't want to go to Molly Mallones, because she is so cool she went to Atmosphere instead(just kidding)  Boys if there is one thing I have told you all and you all know about me is that you can keep repetitively hit me in the head and it won't phase me, I just keep on going on keep on trying. My persistence will pay off or land me up with a dozen or so restraining orders and jail time lol.  However, there is one odd note to add about last night and the ladies.  Pam, who I met in New Orleans and is a friend of Mark's sister, called me out of the blue last night, I haven't spoken with her on the phone in over 3 months. Apparently, they were in Cincinnati for Spring Break, why Cincy who in the hell knows, maybe they were taking notes on how to riot properly. I missed the call and called her back probably 5 to 10 minutes after she called. Anyway, she called to say hi and how things were going and that she missed talking, yadda yadda yadda. I told her to come down and hang out(devilish grin), since it was only 12:30 am. Of course her and her friend were too drunk to drive, but I could drive up there and hang out with them. Yeah, that's it, I am going to ditch on my buddy's birthday party, where I am having a good time, to drive an hour and a half for pussy that may or may not open the door for Mr. Winkie, as Ace Ventura would put it. I am going down to Ft Lauderdale/Miami in August for an ADG thing and she said she would be down there and that we should spend some "quality time together" That's about the time when I needed to get to the bar and get another drink, so I had to end the call then and there. I told her to call me next time she had a chance and that we'd continue the conversation. Bitch is nuttier than a Snickers Bar.  Just figured I would share

      Louisville is not a terrible place to live and it isn't the best either.   The problem is I believe Louisville is going through a phase right now of figuring out what it wants to be and how it wants to get there. When the city and county governments merged to create one metro government, which they should have done back in the 60's or 70's, Louisville jumped into the top 20 list of America's biggest cities. I understand that we are not New York, Chicago, LA, Miami, St. Louis, Dallas, etc. As a group we aren't very suave, not very sophisticated, and don't have a lot of polish. This is in which lies the rub.  Louisville for most of it's history has been a blue collar town, like Chicago and STL. We have had, and still do, a lot of factories and manufacturing. We have our share of white collar types, but Louisvillians collectively, aren't very upity, although God knows some of them try. We do have some old school money here, but not on a really large basis.   So now with the merger, the politicians are trying to make outside businesses and people think that Louisville is this wonderful cosmopolitan town, when in fact it's not. We do have some great things here that some bigger cities don't have: An opera, an orchestra, a theatre, a ballet, an art museum, a science, museum, horse track, skate park, etc.  This makes some people here in town think that we now have an image to portray, which is total bullshit. Louisville is a good sized city, with good people, who just do regular boring stuff. I mean most people would rather go to a movie than the theatre. Go watch the game with some friends than hit the opera. We like to do Actors, Kentucky Center, etc every once in a while, but not on a real consistent basis. That's not who we are as a group.  Louisvillians are notorious for being very gracious hosts, very friendly, helpful, and very generous to charity organizations. However we do have some bad habits that naturally occur.  Most people in Louisville, that grew up here, have friends they have known well over a decade. I mean I have 3 friends I have known since I was born and at least 7 others I have known for over 10 years. If you come into Louisville, it's hard to break into our group. It's almost like a big club-you can hang out with us and come do stuff with us, but your still on the outside looking in on some things.  "Where did you go to school?"  "I went to the University of ___" "No I meant high school"  Only in Louisville, I swear. Any other major US city I go to, if someone asked where you went to school, they mean your university or college. Here in Louisville it's almost like being a bouncer at a bar "Let's see some id?" People can tell with one answer whether or not you are from here. It's just a very odd circumstance.  We pretty much do the same thing. Most people in Louisville do the same thing every weekend. Yeah, there are always changes to the normal schedule, but we pretty much have 2 camps. The people who go to bars and the ones that don't. Just like the political process we need a 3rd of 5th group.   Don't get me wrong Louisville has been this way since I was born and it will probably be that way until I get old. Eventually, Louisville will make a decision on which way it's going, but I can see now, no matter how hard the politicians and the pr people try it will always be this way. A normal city that wants to play with the big boys, but refuses to ante up to sit at the table.  I love Louisville it is my home town. I don't think I could really live anywhere else on a permanent basis. I really like it here because of my friends and family, so if neither of those were here, I believe Louisville would be like other cities are to me right now. Nice to visit and maybe temporarily be there, but it would never be home.

      Well I had a good time last night, I hope everyone else did the same. It was good to see people I hadn't seen in a while and just talk and bs. They had a semi-heated tent at Molly's, so you could converse and drink outside without freezing to death. It almost felt VIP there for a while. Jay I hope you had a good early birthday bro.  Molly's was crowded last night and besides the cover, there was a couple other reasons which reminded me of why I don't like going to that bar on any kind of consistent basis.   1) It's hard as hell to get a drink, but luckily that one chick who works behind the bar would help me out if we made direct eye contact. The bartenders there act like you are being a pain in their ass by asking to get a drink. Excuse me, don't you get paid the better I tip. I tip good anyway, but give me fast, friendly, and accurate service, I will overtip 80% of the time.  2) Too many dudes, is another reason not to go, I mean the ratio was 2 sausages for every 1 fish and that's no good.   3) No really good bands ever usually play up there. I like having good music being played when I am out, and Molly's usually doesn't have it.  4) Too many yuppies and people who think they are cool, when actually they are not.   5) Parking, parking, parking, and the lack thereof at that Dojo.  Once again, good to see everyone, and that everyone had a safe ride home ;)

      Well it looks like we have a tentative schedule of meeting at Jays and then going to Molly Mallone's. After Mollys I am not sure, but I will have the old trusty cell on me, so hit me up. So far I have a couple of confirmed ladies in attendance tonight, which is always good, regardless of whether or not sex will be the result at the end of the night, with ladies around there will be hugs, kisses, and the fact that women around us will in fact draw more women.   I digress, everyone suit up in there PIMP gear and make sure we hit Bardstown Rd in style playas. Fo shizzle my nizzles we're gonna roll this trizzle off the rizzles.   I'M RICH BIATCH!!!!!

      Some people are not very smart and should be rounded up and put in pens, because of that. I know this would never happen and I wouldn't support it, but sometimes stupid people get me frustrated. How many times and how many ways can you explain the same thing to the same person before you go nuts? I am honestly surprised I haven't gone to jail yet with the morons that come in and see me about situations that they created for themselves.   I'll get off my bitching box now.  Tonight, I assume we will all get together somewhere between 7 and 10 and go out and party with Jay. It will be chilly tonight-so ladies wear a coat and leave the padded bra at home. Ouch, did I say that?-how crass! Oh well, while I am on this subject, ladies leave the panties at home as well-lol  I hope to see a good number of you all out. I gotta go wrestle some redneck regarding his overdraft fees. Talk to yall in a few.

      Sorry but that skit on the Chapelle Show when Dave plays Lil' John cracks me up.  No present(s) on my Yahoo account. I will have to hope it comes soon.  Didn't do much last night but laundry, rest, and a good phone conversation. I don't know why, but I have seemed to master the use of the phone and my communication skills while on it. Me and the nice little lady on the other end seemed to have a flowing conversation and I made her laugh, which is always the key to making women feeling more comfortable. Hopefully, she will be more comfortable to hang out now that she seems at ease.  Hey I don't have my cell phone on me, so if any of yall need to get a hold of me 502-266-5113. I feel stupid for forgetting it and naked without it. Hopefully my brother will pick up the phone call me back and make a run out here to drop it off, but who knows if that will happen.

      Well, I am sorry I have not posted more today, but work has been steady and there has been enough paper work for me to do that I probably could have built my own "Chity Wall" to keep out those damn Mongolians.  I am feeling tired yet surprising devilish here at work, like I could go and do something peppy at any moment.   I get to work this weekend, but the plans for tomorrow night seem to be coming together nicely.  Huggy Bear Rules!!

      Well tomorrow night people are going out for an early Jay B-Day. I am not sure as to the local we will be at, but I hope everyone an come hang out. Hopefully, some of the ladies I know will be able to attend. Should be a good time.  Friday is going along okay. Paperwork left and right, but it's coming down.   I saw the movie Antwoine Fisher (sp) though it was a good film. If you get a chance to watch it, check it out.

      I couldn't figure out how to link it correctly, so at the bottom is the address for the story.   They had a bombing this morning at a train station in Madrid killing an estimated 173 people and wounding around 500. They say it is the worst bombing in Spanish history. Makes people going crazy with guns seem almost human. Bombings are a total chicken shit maneuver anyway, total bullshit. Anyway, if you can go to Yahoo or whoever and check it out. Pretty crazy.

      Get off of work last night and went to go work out. I usually hate getting there around 6:30 or so, because everyone gets off work and thinks they will actually stick to their bs New Year's resolutions. Attention all fat asses, 10 minutes on the treadmill and a few sets with dumbbells twice a week won't do shit. However, usually as the weather warms up, all of the yahoos revert back to their old ways, go to the  park or do something else with their time. I was figuring it wouldn't be that bad, but I still wasn't thrilled.  I get there and I get a parking space up front-very odd. I go inside and it was so sparse that I actually got an ellipse machine. For all of you non-gym goers, those are usually very hard to get, because of the low impact they have on your joints, everyone signs up for them and they usually aren't available from 5-8:30 or so. I finally realized why the gym wasn't crowded when I saw some people I know looking up at the TV's. I went over and looked for myself and then it became very clear-U of L was playing. I checked it out for a couple of minutes and then went back to working out. It was so sweet to have a run of the place. Being able to go from decline bench, to leg lifts, etc., etc. without having to wait or do something else. It was truly a relaxing work out.   I am glad U of L won, but I am not sure they will run the C-USA tourny. I hope they do, but they will have to shoot better than 33% to get that accomplished.  It looks like the weekend will be full of plenty of parties. When I find out who is doing what to who where, I will spread the info. Hope everyone has a good Thursday. Thank God tomorrow is Friday and payday, only drawback is me working 12 hours.

      Well, after talking to the wise men and some of the monks, I have more leads for possible weekend dates. Now I know, since most of my friends are guys, that we don't pre-plan a weekend; however, if anyone's band is playing or something give me shout, so that I can maneuver around that-cool. Trump Tight  As always-I'll keep yall posted.

      It comes to my attention that Church needs his own website. The only problem I see with this, is that everyone would be on Church's and not commenting on their own.   Church come on and grow a pair and start a site. You know it would be cool. Plus we could get a read out of weekend events, the section on chicks you know but won't date, and Jay's picks on weekend women  Come on playa!!!

      Well since I was off yesterday let me recap the interesting pace of Monday night.  I get off work later than expected and book home in order to pick up Raul and get over to Flanagan's for trivia. I get home and what do I see but a package from the USPS. Now it's one of those white, paper type that usually only contain t-shirts. To my excitement my Paris t-shirt had arrived. "I spent a night in Paris(wanna see the video) I threw it on laid some rubber down, collected Raul and DRUNKEN MONKEY and made it over to Flanagan's for Trivia Night.  Well, I have a couple of good things to say about trivia. Waggs, Raul, Lepus, Church, myself, and eventually Sarah, had a good time learning facts that George W wouldn't know. However, the food, drink, and company were very good and losing wasn't that bad, considering most teams point totals were pretty sad. Most of the bonus questions were hard and some of the questions were not cream puff questions.  After Trivia, Church, Raul, Sarah, and myself wandered over to Wicks to hang out and continue the drinking. Good time, just again, it was proven that just when I think I can grasp women they throw out the slider or a curve and I get caught looking as 3 strikes pass by. For example, the times I think I should show some reserve on my conversation I should be very open, almost to the point of bawdy. Other times, when I think it is clear to be as frank as I am around my friends, I should have watched my P's and Q's. Who knows, just a learning experience. Can't blame a guy for trying to get a "friends with benefits thing". Women go off of so much other stuff than us guys do, it's hard to understand a reaction or decision based on feelings. I mean I understand if a chick said you too cute or too ugly, too smart, too dumb, not rich enough, etc., but basically be told it's not you it's me kind of a thing just doesn't compute in my mind. So I spent the rest of the night analyzing where I am deficient and came to realize I am not. No one take this the wrong way. I like sex, but I am not going to go slumming to get some, I am somewhat selective on who I want to play with. I know what some of you have already said, but I still think the sex with her would have really kicked ass, besides she's a cool chick. The search goes on across the grasslands. I guess I just don't have enough spark lol  On Tuesday me and pops got my taxes finished. Not a ton coming back from Uncle Sam, but enough to make a dent on all the money I have spent on that condo recently. Hopefully, that will get back to me before May and I can pay some stuff off. It was good to hang out with pops and just discuss local and national events and political matters, as well as, other business stuff. It's good quality time.  Raul and I went searching the 7 seas yesterday for a TV that would fit my entertainment center. That won't happen unless I want to buy a 25 inch and that's a no go. So now I must find a entertainment center that will house at least a 27 inch TV, which for everyone's knowledge, is at least 30 inches wide and 23.5 inches tall.  When I was driving into work today, I heard that 80's song that Orgy remade "Black Tuesday"? Anyway I was thinking, when I get done with my movie script and eventually get a deal, that song is going into the movie somewhere during a car chase, shoot out, or really hot sex scene.  I hope everyone's week is going well. I am still drying out from Monday. Big Ups to Raul for hanging out like a trooper and drinking for what seemed like hours. It was good hanging out bro-very cool of you.

      Well the Nero Sun show went well on Friday. The band sounded good, a good crowd formed up at Wicks, and the booze flowed like the rain that was coming down earlier in the day. It seemed like everyone had a great time. I know I did ;)  Me and Raul went hunting for TV's yesterday and I have found one that will fit in my entertainment center. We tried Circuit City and Best Buy, but both were closed. Went over to WalMart 1 and didn't like the looks of things, so we went over to WalMart 2. We found the model, but it took us 5 or 10 minutes to find a sales associate, who said he didn't work that area, that he was working security and would get someone over to help me out. They were busy watching 8 or so Hispanics who were looking at CD's-ridiculous. We waited around until 8:13 pm, basically 20 minutes, and just left. Good to know WalMart is more worried about a loosing a $15 cd, that was bought by the way, than a customer who is ready to purchase a $400 TV. I am glad I didn't buy one, because when I got home HH Gregg was offering the same one for 70 bucks cheaper-Trump Tight baby. I will pick it up tomorrow night and it will be goood!!  The Sopranos season opener was last night-decent opener-someone got whacked-very funny scene I thought. Robert Logia and Steve Buschemi are in the season, and Tony and Dr. Melfi might get it on. She had a dream about nailing Tony with her on top. Man does Lorraine Brocco have some great breasts-yum.  Tonight Flannigans for Trivia a little before 7pm. If you feel like dropping some knowledge and winning a $50 bar tab head on up.  Oh yeah, for the record there was no date #2 this weekend, no worries.

      I was up rather late last night working on some stuff and the E channel had something about "manscaping". Now in case none of yall have heard, this is some dumb bitches cute idea of basically guys trimming or shaving their body hair. I totally blame this on "Sex and the City", I am so glad that show is gone. Anyway, I myself have trimmed south of the border, but never shaved it all off. Also I have shaved my chest and under my arms. I haven't shaved or trimmed in a while, partly due to laziness and part due to my schedule. I was just wondering what the ladies thought of hair vs no hair and what we guys think about the subject in general.   The other subject is due to me being nosy at the gym last night. This chick was complaining about going down on her guy, that it was gross. However, before I could go on a rant, her girlfriend said that it was just part of sex and that if the chick's boyfriend gave her oral, then she should reciprocate. Hearing that I just kept my mouth shut, because she said what I was going to. I mean, I know it is not easy for women to master the art of fellatio; however, figuring out how to make a woman cum while going down on her is not easy either. Honestly, I would never sleep with a chick that wouldn't go downtown. I love going down on a woman. Not only is it a turn on, but the ability to have that kind of power over someone's body is amazing. My theory is that oral is a reciprocal thing. Neither partner should expect the other to do it, if they aren't willing to do it themselves. I have never found giving a chick oral gross or disgusting. It is something different that I like and happen to be good at. Just wanted to get people's opinions on this one as well.   Just remember Hewett and his band are up at Gerstle's tonight starting at 10 pm. If you can make it up there, come hang out, have a drink, and give them some support. Lata playas

      Well I was off yesterday and got to watch 2 of my favorite sports shows PTI and Around the Horn. Both shows discussed the issue of players in baseball taking growth hormones and steroids. This has been going on in the MLB for quite some time now, the only thing new this time is that there is hard evidence and it seems as if a good portion of the players want drug testing instituted like in the NFL, NHL, NBA, etc. Of course there is no good test for the growth hormones, only the roids. Honestly, I will believe all of the named players are innocent until proven guilty, but I really do hope Bonds gets busted. He has put on a lot of muscle and I think the guy is an asshole.  Now being a former athlete, all be it on a small scale, you always had someone doing roids or something else to help boost their performance during the season. There weren't that many guys doing it, but you could tell when a guy gained 30 pounds of muscle over the summer with an attitude to go with it that he was on something. Luckily I was born crazy and had enough fat and muscle to play decent. I did address 2 of my team mates who I found out were shooting up. I know it's not my body, but when we were on a run to try to win a state championship, I didn't want anything getting in the way that could cost us that.  I think athletes are under a lot of pressure; however, I think the MLB will eventually get a testing system set up because the players want it. Gary Sheffield looked like he was ready to whip it out yesterday and take a test right on the spot, he was that serious that he didn't do anything to enhance his stats. It takes a lifetime to get to where these guys are at. A lot of hustle, working out, and sacrifices happen to get there. The steroids and hormones can win you stats, but like McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds, you can't win a title. If you think I am full of it with any of those 3, check them all out when they started and look how big they are now. Of course McGwire's body broke down after he quit taking his stuff.  Championships are a team thing

      Army of Darkness was on last night and it was good to be able to sit down and watch it.  Church is right about trivia; however, we did tie for first in round one, came in fourth for round two, and at the end of round three we were in second place. It was that friggin final bonus question. I digress, we all had a good time and had a lot of fun making fun of people, the questions, and the music. I don't think I helped the team too much, but my knowledge of my people's culture helped us get the "Black History Month" question right.  Just remember Hewett's band is playing tomorrow night at Gerstle's starting at 10 pm, so if you can get out there roll on up. I will be there a little early to get a seat. Also, on Friday Nero Sun will be at Wicks, I assume their start time is 10 pm as well. Hope everyone gets out for both shows.  I am glad someone got the lyric answers that was Trump Tight.

      Well since it looks like the masked Insight Poacher has left the game preserve, let's everyone get in a relaxed mood and play the lyric game.   Since there was some misunderstanding last time, I'll break it down for yall. I will list 5 lyrics. Email me your answers and whoever gets the most right wins the contest. If you don't know an answer just say so on your email, i.e. #2 I don't know. I will be out of the office tomorrow, so I will post the lyrics today and that gives yall until 2 pm or so on Wednesday to email me your answers. I believe that is fair enough.  1) "I am not your carpet ride, I am the sky" 2) "I'm the dog that gets beat, shove my nose in shit" 3) "Forget about the check, we'll get hell to pay" 4) "Your bones with build my palaces, your eyes will stud my crown, for I am Mars the god of war and I will strike you down" 5) "The blade of my knife passed away from your heart, those last few nights it turned and sliced you apart"

      In response to this new development I will not ban the dude or chick, because I really don't care, as of yet.   To you who is going around and responding to the entries on the various blogs I say this: No one cares that you make comments, it's the fact that you have been rather rude in what you have said. I am sure if we knew you, and we soon might, it may have been taken in a different manner. However, since no one seems to know you, yet, you have come off as rude, arrogant, and hostile. I would suggest, if you can, making amends. If you know us, then you will. If you don't know us and don't fix the mistakes you've made then you have made a serious error in judgement. I hope this is just a misunderstanding and that it all works out, because I hate it when everyone gets riled up.

      Well I had a date on Saturday night and I think things went alright. I got a good vibe off of it, she seems like a very cool chick. I guess I will wait and see if I get to take her out on a second date or not. I know some of you all met her and some did not. It seemed like those of you who met her had good things to say, which I am glad. For those of you who haven't met her, well we'll have to see if she hangs out again and that we're all at the same place at the same time. I'll keep everyone posted if I have a follow up. That would be nice to have a second date.

      Today, so far has been a very good day. I didn't have to come in until 9, I might get off early, I got a full 9 hours of sleep last night, we're slow, my new suit looks Trump Tight, and everything looks good for tonight. The only downside is the rain, but hey, as long as it clears up for tomorrow.   Dave Chappelle's voice is ringing in my head, so the next woman that pisses me off, I will say "You wear underwear with dickholes in them"  That line gets me to laugh everytime.

      Well, it looks as if season 2 of Chappelle show is over. At least from what I can tell they will be replaying seasons 1 and 2 this summer every Tuesday night at 10 pm.  Last night on the 10:30 episode, the infamous Season 1 "Haters Ball" was on. If you haven't seen this skit you are being deprived of laughing your ass off.   First of all they make it look like HBO is doing a documentary. ICE-T is the MC of the ball and Dave Chappelle plays Silky Johnson. ICE-T gets up to start the ball off and someone starts hating on ICE, who then replies "If one of you muthafuckers says anything else while I am talking...I'll shoot ya muthafucking ass!" The 2 funniest parts are Dave showing up to the ball and Charlie Murphy making fun of his fur coat and the other guy playing a character called "Beautiful" making remarks as well. Dave replies to Charlie Murphy that the fur coat is made out of Charlie's Mamma's pubic hairs and then said Beautiful was a stand in for Little Richard in Gay Porn. The second funny moment and probably the funniest is when they are showed pictures of celebrities like Puffy and the Osbornes and they all make comments on that person. They show a picture of Rosie O'Donnell on a red carpet thing with her finger broken. Dave Chappelle says "That bitch has dick holes in her underwear." They have to cut away from that part, because everyone in the skit starts laughing their asses off uncontrollably. I myself, have almost fell out of my chair typing it.  Last night was also funny, because the last Season 2 episode was all music clips and Dave Chappelle actually sang the theme song from the Dukes of Hazard, with John Mayer playing guitar and the drummer from the Roots. Classic shit right there.  I can't wait for season 3 and also buy Season 1 on DVD-because Dave Chappelle is one funny SOB. He is now my favorite comedian and I would put him in my top 5.  ICE-T, "Our next nominee for Hater of the Year is Silky Johnson. Silky called in a bomb threat to the Special Olympics because they were getting more attention that him"  LATA HATERS.....HATE,HATE,HATE,HATE,HATE.

      All I have to say is what a combined team play by Graham, Church, Wags, and myself. We win the trivia game last night by 9 points, with huge answers of Whitey Ford by Wags, Graham coming up with the map of India making it a slam dunk on where the Ganges empties into, Church with the Dune answer, and myself coming up with Meatloaf's birthname. It was a total route of Natty Sci or whatever they are calling themselves these days, and got the big $50 for next week. I must say that it truly was a great night. Hockey fights on one screen, hot women softball players on the other, good food, cold drinks, and good company. Congrats on a well played team effort.

      Sorry yall about last night. I just crashed at home watching "Snatch". It's something about my couch that just promotes sloth. The thing is so damn comfortable, I just start dozing off on it when I sit back on it. I will bet the good times rolled without the Rhino. No worries, for Derby is next weekend and we will be able to party hard then.   Sopranos at my house tonight if anyone wants to watch it. They finished the front parking lot, so all the spaces are back to normal out there.   Lata

      I just had a guy in my office named Check Bun, now that may not seem funny, but the way it was printed on his license was Bun, Check. It took a lot for me not to laugh about that name looking that way.  I really wanted to say, "Here you go Mr. Bun Check"  That is my little quip of humor for the day.  By the way Lepus Derby is not gay-it is just a pain in the ass dealing with these out of town assholes who come here and think they can do whatever they want just because they are pumping the local economy with cash. F'em, F'em in the ear!  lol  I'll give some of yall a call and see who's up for what tonight.  Lata Playas

      Now I can get a real officially licensed NY Giants Jersey with Manning on the back.   I think it is funny how The Mannings are refusing to let Eli go to the Chargers and that Archie Manning wants Eli playing for the Giants this year. I think it rocks, even if Eli has to sit out this season and suit up in 2005. I guess we'll see how the drama unfolds this weekend. I personally can't wait to see how it goes.

      I hate stupid people in general, but I really hate stupid customers. Working with peoples finances shows just how retarded people are, even though they have good jobs and make good money. This woman overdrew her account and didn't want to pay for it. I explained everything to her in great detail; however she thought I should give her money. I think she was really pissed off when:   she said "And how am I supposed to know when I don't have any money in my account?" I replied "Your checkbook register?" she replies "I want the name and number of your boss" I replied "Okay that info is........"   Pete almost had to get out and choke a bitch

      First let me comment that I was not drunk off of Finlandia, athough that is a very good vodka. On Thunder I started off with a quarter bottle of Bacardi O and Sunkist, then polished of the quarter bottle of Stoli I had, then moved to 2 Makers and Coke. Arru and Raul came and picked me up and I went with them to Beer-Hala; however that was closed and we ended up at Patricks. I was very disappointed not to play a good round of putt-putt, but I digress. At Patricks we played some pool and then went out on the back deck. At this point I had had 2 vodka and Cokes and was feeling the flow. I am a very big NY Giants fan and when the subject of "Jeff Hoss" was brought up I did go off. I didn't just say fuck him in the ear, it was fuck him in the eye, the nose, just fuck him all together. Contrary to what Waggs said, he was not Super Bowl 25 MVP. Hoss can go to hell and die for all I care. I hope LT finds him and breaks his legs. I can score LT some crack and get him rolling.   As for being Walter from the "Big Labowski" yes and no. I have never taken a Louisville Slugger to someone's car, although I have threatened a trespasser on my parents property with an aluminum TPX bat. I wasn't in Nam, I don't own a guns or many guns that it would take to fill up a gun rack, and I have never been married. I do have a tendency to go off and scare the living crap out of people. I think if I grew a goatee I would look more like him. Although if I had a picture taken of me holding a 9mm glock like Walter, it may be close.  Trvia was bad on Monday, but once again we were close to winning, just that damn last bonus question.  Last night was cool, because it was Back Yard Wrestling on PS2 and slushies. Arru, Raul, Waggs, and I had fun playing the characters. The 2 best moves are by the female character who does the "Earmuffs" and the "Southern Comfort" funny as hell and we all had a good time.  Is Wayne Brady gonna have to get out of this car and choke a bitch????

      If you missed his show last night, you possibly missed one of his funniest shows of the year. First, Dave as Lil Jon, talks with the actual Lil Jon. I can't stand Lil Jon, but the whole think was funny as hell. To top that off, Dave then becomes the "Black Bush" and recreates the whole scenario with going to war with Iraq, but from the perspective if Bush was black. I laughed so hard I was crying. The thing that the skit did that I wish actually happened, was a president that cursed at the reporters and made fun of weaker foreign powers. If you see the re-run come on, take the time to watch it, you'll have a great laugh over it.

      Well I had a great morning. Woke up at 8, had something to eat, watched some sports center, played some PS2, it was just a good morning. End up at work and nothing has gotten done in the past 2 days. So today I busted ass and got a ton of shit done. The monthly audit I wrapped up in 2 hours, in between customers and other bs. If you saw this audit you would understand that is a very good time frame. I cleaned up the pending and closed loan files in the office, 12 to be exact. Everything with the loans are current and I sent 3 for closing. Worked on 3 bankcard issues, cleaned up my holdover account, notarized 5 docs, and refilled the ATM. To too shabby for a pudgy guy.  Besides all that, I am finding out more and more that the possibilities are getting more slim of my regional returning from his shenanigans down in Florida. I love it. If he gets canned I will be very happy, possibly giddy over not having to deal or see him again. Triple Titanium Trump Tight

      Well my buddies came into town on Friday and we went out and partied pretty good Friday night. Went down to Saints, ate some very good pizza, drank quite a bit, played some pool, and grabbed some digits. Hit Twig N Leaf for some late night grub and then went home and crashed. Saturday I cooked up some eggs for breakfast, went to Hooters for lunch around noon, then Shenanigan's for some apps around 4, then Bucca Di Beppos for a really filling meal around 8. I don't think I will need to eat at all today. I am really full.  I am glad the games turned out the way they did. Eddie Satan, I mean Sutton will not get a shot at a national title and that minature Hitle, Krywegdhgwjkehflkjhfski will not get another one. All is right in the universe.  Hope yall are having a good weekend. Lata playas

      First of all if you don't know what happened pick up a newspaper, etc.  I want to state that originally I was against the war in Iraq. Now I know to some of you that may have come as a shock, but I am not for starting a fight with people who haven't started it. I believed, at the time, that we should have still been concentrating on Osama and killing him, but I digress.  Now that we are there, I believe firmly in protecting American lives and getting the hell out of there. Let the UN handle setting up whatever government the Iraqi people want and one that they deserve.  As to the fucking thugs that blew up that SUV with our countrymen in it, I say we kill them and anyone else caught hurting an American. I am not for hurting innocent men, women, or children. Most Iraqis, regardless of what some conservatives say, are normal people. They want a nice place to live, good food, medical attention when they need it, give their children a better future and so on. I say leave those people alone to continue on their peaceful lives and to help them maintain it. The thugs on the other hand, like anywhere else in the world, should be hunted down and shot where they are caught. I am not a violent person, I like living my life and letting everyone live theirs. However, when someone decides they want to harm me, my family, or try to disturb my life, then I am prepared to kill that person. No one has the right to hurt others. Now I know some of you are saying that I just said I would kill someone. True, I did, but only if they cross the line of natural order and interfere with my right to live.   You see, I know what some of these liberals will say and do "See America, people are dying we need to pull out, it's not our business, those people drug bodies through the streets, we need to get out!"  My response 'BULLSHIT!!!" Yeah, originally, we shouldn't have been there, our government sent our troops there for no real reason. The thing is that we're there now and we need to make sure that this kind of shit ceases immediately. We find out who did it and publicly execute them. Let their corpses rot in the streets until the decay-I don't care. That was someone's father, son, brother, uncle, who died, which honestly, was a possibility being over there, but to have your body disrespected like that is just wrong. It makes me so angry, I couldn't watch the whole thing on the news. It's like Somalia all over again.   If this administration wants to get back in office, they'll find those mother fuckers and kill them. Do it in the town square. I am sick and tired of seeing our people, yes our people-Americans, killed over some bullshit thing our government started and our government not having the balls to honor their memory. I would hate to think that someone I knew or loved would go off to some corner of the globe, die, and then my government pussy out and just say "Well, blah, blah, blah"  Does no one remember why Vietnam was ineffective?? We lost because we didn't go in balls to the wall and do the job, amongst other reasons. I am just so pissed this is going on and everyone is like "Ohh no this is bad we need to leave" No we need to Napalm the fucks that did this and then have a cook out over their flaming bodies.  Fuck the World, bring ever military person home, build a wall up, and tell the world to leave us out of their problems. I know our government has fucked stuff up, so let's fix what they did wrong and just let the rest of the world try to work their shit out.   I'm pissed. Just my thoughts on the bs going on.

      Well, here I sit, with 45 minutes left to go in the work day, while all the rest of you are out partying, well probably not, you all are probably eating dinner, watching TV, or lamenting the fact no one has a concrete plan for this nice 3 day weekend, 4 day in my case.  Raul said he is not having a throw down, so who's stepping up-Anthony are you going to have one then?  Tonight I will probably be low key, I need to lower my ears tomorrow and get some other things done, but party we will regardless if it's Frankfort Ave or the Highlands. Remember they are putting 60 more officers out for the holiday and thanks to those whiny assholes at the OHNA. Friggin hippie, yuppy scumbags.  Rhonda just called, which was odd, she seems happy to talk to me, that she is glad she has someone to talk to, but at the same time I can tell when I start to get into more of a personal or laid back discussion, she puts a wall up. I don't know why that freaks her out. Anyone, i.e. Jay, Hewett, etc. know if Carrie is single or not? I just want to take her out one night and see how it goes. I don't know her that well, which is why I would like to just get a couple of hours with her and chill out in a setting away from her model friends and away from yall-no offense. My guess is she is dating some rocker, model, athlete, etc. I will say it was a nice time just sitting next to her last night having a little bit of conversation. I still have to call Jennifer, no not Jennifer B, who we all know and love, but the one from the Southside and see what's up. Other than that, I don't think I have anymore prospects in town, but I do have 2 in STL and 1 in the other ville South of us. I do know my friend Bert G's mom is trying to hook me up, why I don't know.  When did it become odd for people to wait until they were settled, emmotionally, financially, etc. before they got married and had kids? I'm not even 30 yet-what is the big deal? My parents didn't get married until they were 30, so why are they, or should I say  my Dad-trying to rush me? Plus Pops is even saying stuff about not having grandkids yet-jeez.  Hopefully, the next time yall see me, the cut will be back to the proper fade of my normal style. I will say I have gotten a lot of compliments growing it out though. Friggin corporate-if they would just let me grow my ponytail once-I would be content for the rest of my life. One of these days I am growing it out. I just want to see what it looks like really, really, long.  30 minutes, all down hill from here. I plan on driving West bound on 64 with the shades on, windows down, and "99 Problems" blasting on the system-Roca Fella Yall! So watch out and get out of my way, cause I am doing it old school like "Bullet"  I'm Audi S8

      Well, last night Hewett and the boys aka Cabin opened up for the Von Bondies. Besides the fact that some people aka Cornett and Kelly were afraid of the Tornado that never was, the night started out very well. I grabbed 2 waters and hung with Tip, Waggs, the Baron and Baroneess, Jay, and Allie. All other seating was either occupied or being saved by other people. Carrie ended up coming out and I actually got a hug, which was nice, because I wasn't expecting it. Eventually, I got a seat, everyone eventually showed up and we got to watch Cabin do a great set. I thought it would be longer, but they only got 45 minutes?, but they did a great job with that time. Everyone eventually left after the 2 second band, but in all fairness to all the bands, I stuck around to hear the Von Bondies and sat with Carrie to watch them. We closed the place down and I left to go home. I am glad everyone could come out and support the band. Good to hang out and listen to some good music. I think there will be some partying this weekend, which will be cool. Talk to you all then.  This is my report on the 3 bands that played last night: Cabin, Christian?, and The Von Bondies.  To be honest Hewett's Band sounded very good. They were the most orginal sounding band at the performance. I liked the way the songs sounded and were performed. I was proud of them for doing a good job. I think if they would have played more it would have been even better.  The second band was the most energetic stage show I have seen in a very long time, only problem was that they are confused. They seem like good musicians, but the lyrics and music never seemed to click. No one really seemed to be into it, which is unfortunate, because these guys were going full speed all of the time. Hopefully a friend will talk to them.  The Von Bondies. Well, they were good, but the problem is that I think they sound like Jet, The Strokes, The White Stripes, etc. Just nothing new to see or hear, but they were a good band. I just didn't feel their vibe.

      Well boys and girls looks like Atmosphere will be just like the atmosphere-invisible, you know, can't be seen physically. We'll know for sure after the court battle between the owners and the city. First time I have rooted for the city in a long time, if ever.  It seems, thanks to the OHNA causing all the publicity over noise, crowds and everything else that goes with a few thousand people hanging out in a 3 block radius, that Atmosphere got audited. The audit found that Atmosphere can't claim restaurant status, due to the fact that they don't make 50% or more of their profits from food sales. By not having the 50%, the city would classify them as a bar. Unfortunately for Atmosphere and fortunately for the rest of us, The Outlook Inn is across the street. According to city policy you can't have 2 bars within 700 feet of each other. Since Outlook was there first, it seems that Atmosphere would have to close and go somewhere else. The owners of Atmosphere plan to fight the audit, but according to the head guy at the city, it looks like they're screwed, because their own receipts show otherwise. Tom Owen said he plans to make sure everyone gets audited. I am sure everyone else will be fine and that hell hole of a yuppie/white trash hang out will go by the wayside.  Atmosphere all I have to say, in the words of Dave Chappelle, LATER BITCHES!!!  If I see an article about it, I will forward it to yall.  On a side note.  urlLink It  is still going on over at Mid City Mall. That place should be glad someone wants to park outside in front of that shit hole. Jeez

      Anyone have any plans for the weekend? I know  urlLink Raul  said possibly having a get together at his crib, due to the remodling being completed. This is a 4 day for me and 3 for the rest of yall, so let's get cracking on a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday plan.  Don't forget that Cabin aka Hewett's band is playing at Headliners tomorrow night starting at 9 pm. Tickets can be purchased at Ear X Tacy for $10 or $12 at the door. 3 bands are playing, so don't give me shit over the price-I didn't set it. It should be a good time, so stop by and have some fun and start the weekend off right.

      Well, yesterday was a good day after the dentist. Me and  urlLink Raul  trecked over to Valhalla for the Senior PGA practice round. We got to watch Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Gill Morgan, and some other people tee off, putt around, and generally make some funny comments. Raul picked a good spot in front of the 17th tee, which was very shaded, and we literally were 2 feet from the guys as they took their drives. The course was, to quote Mike Meyers "FRIGGIN HUGE!", and I think our  urlLink special lady viking friend  would have liked being there. If I was a true viking I would have been pleased.   Now, don't get me wrong. Beerhalla is great and is easily in my range of talent and closer to my home. However, Valhalla, is truely a great course that gives the pros a challenge and will keep Louisville in the spot light for many years.

I myself am going for the Speaker City shirt like in "Old School"  Trivia Tonight-I have our name   "Didlo Baggins the Ass Raping Hobbit"   Any ideas on that one?

      I can't help it. I have been playing that album pretty much non stop since I got it, now granted I haven't listened to every song, but I do know if you hit tracks 6,7,9,10,11,12-not too bad.  Between 99 Problems, Dirt off ya Shoulder, and RIP, that's better than some rappers do in 4 albums. J has talent and it's too bad he is "retiring" assuming that stays true. I know he talks lots of shit about how good he is, but when it's true it's true.  If any of yall actually listen to rap, and I know some of you old skoolers do, check out  urlLink the web site  and look around. I know most stores have the album cheap still. I don't think this albumn tops "Blueprint", which is in my top 5 all time, but it is up there with "Hardknock Life Volume 2"  Sorry, but I've got 2 songs rotating in my head. I have to discuss to get them out.

      Well, I am working today and I doubt we will get any busier, which huffs nutts hard.  Got home from work yesterday and actually fired up my ac after returning from getting groceries, since I was all out of food. Hey, it was hot and I was hungry-always wanted to legitimately use that line from "Real Genius". By out of food, I mean I was out, unless you count crackers, pineapple slices, mayo, ketchup, peanut butter, champaign, wine, Jager, vodka, and Makers as food stuffs. I think I did pretty well stocking up for $40. I had hot dogs and mac n cheese for dinner then chilled out and watched a movie/Lakers T Wolves game, kept flipping back and forth. I was impressed with how the mac n cheese came out, since I haven't ever cooked the stuff before. I have done the micro wave stuff before, but this time I went out and bought the stuff you had to cook. I cooked a little too much for one person, but it was pretty good. I think I'll put in some more butter next time. Pretty uneventful night, but, it didn't look like anyone else was doing anything, at least I didn't get a call anyone was.  I am going into the gym today, because I need to do some cardio and 2 days in a week is sad, but only gone once is pathetic. I need to drop some weight, which is only around my abs. They only way I could get a six pack in the next few weeks is if I went to the store and bought one. After that I have no clue what's going on for tonight.  Has anyone noticed that I get zero posts on this thing. I know some of you SOB's are reading without commenting, which is cool, but it is nice to see some verbal banter. I guess knowing people read it is better than nothing.  Gonna roll off here and just sit back and maybe by a news paper. Luckily I can buy a USA Today here, but the Courier Journal is terrible. Why can't we get a decent paper in this town? I don't even mind the slant to the left, but for Chirst's sake can we get some decent reporting on local, regional, and national events? Shitty, shitty, shitty.   Later yall

      Well it is Friday. I have to work this weekend, but it is a fair trade for a 3 day weekend next week, plus Tuesday off to go to Valhalla and watch some golf.  urlLink Red Sonja  should like that.  Other than that I have a shit load of stuff to do at home from laundry to grocery shopping-hey Rhinos need more than grass and berries.  I also have to concur with  urlLink Waggs  about getting laid. It has been a couple of months and I am starting to feel edgy. Any ladies feel like helping me out-lol-just kiding.   Well everyone have a good weekend. Give me a buzz if anything is going on. Depending I may go out.  Lata

      Well a couple of good notes from yesterday and for the weekend.  My parents are in Cancun of all places. I got the nod that they were going Wednesday night, basically in time to know they were stepping onto a plane on Thursday morning. I was glad to know they told me they were leaving just in case something happens to them. Just hope my pops doesn't get arrested down there.  My brother is the new owner of a 1965 Ford Galaxy Custom 500 with a 352 engine. The thing is Triple Trump Tight. It needs a little bit of work, more cosmetic than anything. It does need new tires, spark plugs, hoses, belts, muffler, etc, but once that gets running correctly that thing will be a beast. Ahh, back when cars were made of steel. You didn't have to worry about the kids sitting on the hood or the trunk in fear of them cracking the plastic. This car holds 6 or 7 inside, plus 5 in the trunk. Very proud of the kid. Anyone's thoughts on his new car??  Speaking of cars, how f-d up would be to see  urlLink this  in your review mirror while committing a crime  If people want to come over tonight and hang out/watch movies/drink/PS2, etc. That's cool, just let me know.  Tomorrow, I just need to get a hair cut, a few poster frames, the gym, and just enjoy having a day off.  Sunday-free tickets to the Bats game. So that's where I'll be if yall need me.   I don't feel like any brain busting posts today. I'll leave that up to the rest of yall.

      Since no onse seems to be reading or posting I will shamelessly promote the links that seem to have a lot of conversation and interesting things going on aka  urlLink Church ,  urlLink tha Sci  and the  urlLink Big Pimp  himself, even though he promotes Hostetler.  I will say that that chick PFC will get stuck in prison, She sounds like a freak, regardless if she was taking orders or not. Not only did she have the dog collar around the naked Iraqi's neck, she was on video having sex in front of prisoners with other troops. Man what a fucking mess.

      Well I bought a DVD and a new CD when I went to Target to get a new smoke detector. I always end up getting more shit. Anyway the CD was GNR's greatest hits, all the shit you loved, plus the version of "sympathy for the Devil" that was on the "Interview with a Vampire" soundtrack. The DVD I got was "Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels" great movie by the way, but I liked "Snatch" better.  I do need to get more furniture, so I think I will go looking this weekend and see if I can find something decent and cheap.  Well my new regional is really cool, plus he brought as Homer would say "Dooughhhnuts" to the meeting this morning.  Gotta roll-catch you playas lata.  Will someone tell POWEN to get his site up.

      As odd as everyone makes out that people are so different, I find it refreshing that most Iraqis are as appalled at the  urlLink beheading  as we are about the prison incident.  Humans aren't that different after all.

      Well, I was at the gym yesterday, doing my weight routine, when I here some Creatine/Steroid dumbass' talking about politics. Before I got into a fight over their stupidity and the doom of any children they have, due to lack of intelligence, I decided to move over to a treadmill and do some cardio. I had a 25 pound weight in my hand and seriously considered beating them both in the head with it. My tollerance for listening or dealing with stupid people is getting low and I am worried I will end up beating someone's ass here soon.  I saw the stuff on TV regarding the beheading. I thought it was stupid of him to be over there, but then I thought-fuck it, people have been traveling the globe for centuries and he should have the right to move around where he wants. My thought is everyone should be able to go where they want-get hassled-probably-but not killed. Beheading a civilian, yeah, that makes me fucking sympathetic to everyone in Iraq right now-Fuck'em. We shouldn't ever mistreat POW's, but beheading a countrymen of mine to try to sway my thoughts on this war, only makes me angry enough to think we should just drive through the streets of the towns and shoot anything moving. I was sympathetic to those prisoners, I was already pissed off at our guys, and pissed off at military brass and the administration for not finding out and kicking the shit out of people sooner. This little beheading thing, only makes me stop in my tracks and think about supporting an even more agressive view on this war. About leaving my human compassion on the ground, picking up a gun, going over there and just start killing people. That's wrong and I know it is, but I see stuff sometimes and start to feel myself losing my temper and going into a rage. I don't think these Islamic militants understand the American mind very well. Leaving us alone will further your cause-fucking with us only makes the general masses want to fuck you up and spit on your cause. I mean how many times do you go to the store and some group is trying to get you to give them money. Don't most of yall usually give, considering the organization of course, if they are more passive than agressive? I am now on a holy war or Jihad of my own to take out all crazy militant religious nuts Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Shintos, etc. They're fucking up the rotation. I could use Jesus with a AK-47 and a banana clip right now the way I am feeling. Of course for the rest of you, your God with an AK-47 will work fine too.  If anyone didn't see Tim Russert on The Daily Show last night, it was really good. Him and Jon Stewart really brought up a lot of good points about everything going on. If you get to see the repeat-highly suggest you view it. Russert said Americans do have a responsibility, militarily to be held to a higher standard, because not only do we usually do it, we, as a citizen base, expect it as well. Not an exact quote-but yall get the jist. Like I said check it out when you can.

      FUCK JEFF HOSTETLER!!!  He is a piece of shit and I hate him. If I could, I would be a sticker logo with Calvin pissing on his head. I think he sucks and he is a punk. That cocksucker had the balls to talk shit about the Giants and Bill Parcells after the Giants cut his impotent ass from the team for being a whinning little bitch of a failure. I hate Jeff Hostetler. I hope he goes to prison and gets skull fucked by members of any of the big prison gangs.   Hey Hostetler-if you read this, and I hope by some divine intervention you do, I hope LT and Jeremy Shockey get fucked up and rip you to pieces. That or a crazy mob outside The Meadowlands treats you like and Iraqi war prisoner. You piece of fucking shit go to hell!  FUCK JEFF HOSTETLER!!!

      Well, it's good to see people are reading the site, even if they aren't making comments.  Anyway, let me talk a little bit about what is on everyone's mind recently.  Basically, I feel pretty strongly about my home Louisville KY USA. I love America, I love what I can do here, all the cool stuff I have seen, all the opportunities that are afforded to me.  That being said, I am very pissed off and disappointed in the recent issues regarding military personnel torturing prisoners and doing some pretty messed up stuff by my standards i.e. rape, getting guys naked, etc. I knew with the US going into the war, there would be prisoners that would get beaten for information-it happens every war. I never imagined the shit some of these assholes would be doing. I mean the Marqui De Sade(sp) had nothing on this. I mean, the guys and ladies doing this stuff to the prisoners are some sick fucks. We, as Americans, aren't supposed to behave this way. I shouldn't be surprised, I guess that is why I am pissed. There are plenty of people in this country who are very sick and twisted and all they do is going around hurting others. Our military is a reflection of us as a population. Thus why wouldn't there be some sick, twisted fucks in the military-on quite a few levels? It makes sense doesn't it?   Therefore I am offering a solution to the problem and a way to increase order and show the world we ain't taking shit off anyone, including our own. Anyone convicted by a military court privates, generals, whoever, of rape, torture, etc, should be publicly executed live on TV aired around the world. This country has gotten so scared of giving someone the ultimate punishment it's sad. Sometimes people can't be rehabilitated, they did something so wrong, or they are just plain evil. Therefore, the only way to ensure those people won't do anything to harm another human being-is to kill them. I know it is harsh, I know we want to be able to help everyone, but sometimes you can't do it. When you have 100% proof that someone is raping, killing, torturing, molesting, etc other people-the only answer is death for the offender.  Now, I know, some of you think I am wrong, but this would send a strong message to everyone-our troops, our people, our enemies, and our friends. If we are willing to kill our own for their wrong doings-what do you think we will do if you do the same to us. Ironic I know, considering we keep saying we treat prisoners ethically.   Maybe I am wrong, maybe the population of troops doing this stuff is small, and that the court hearing and public and administration outcry will make them curb their behavior or stop altogether. Maybe this will be an example to regular citizens that behaving like this is wrong and is not tolerable by anyone. Maybe the trials will be enough for our enemies and our allies.   I am a skeptic by nature and I say it won't be. Someone will be crying for blood somewhere and I am for giving it to them. I don't see any of those troops getting life in Leavenworth. I really don't. They honestly don't deserve to be alive after what they have done. I don't feel bad about saying it and I wouldn't feel pity if the government did it. Sometimes your mistakes must be paid for with your life. It may not sound right, but sometimes the right choices/decisions are the toughest to do or make.

      Well, we didn't place first at Trivia last night, but I'll take the $25 second place finish. Again we were in first place going into the final bonus question, but screwed it up. The good thing was no one got the question right-some teams just wagered less points. I will say  urlLink Raul  was right and we should have bet less or bet nothing at all.  However, it was a great team effort and I can't fault the performance.  urlLink Church  came through with a hell of a cast party(Willem Defoe, Barbara Hershey, and Harvey Keitel) answer, the movie was "The Last Temptation of Christ". Raul, Waggs, Neron, Steve-O, and myself all contributed on an equal level, just not nailing, excuse the pun, something like that. I do have to give it to  urlLink Tha Sci  for having the funniest team name I have ever heard up there, and believe me there are some choice ones. Their team name was "I left my creative juices on the wetnap at the Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen movie". The MC for the night commented he thought it was odd that John Stamos got divorced right after those 2 turned 18. Hey, they're both legal and hot-can you blame the guy if he does? Although Rebecca Rojmin(sp) is so hot-I'm proposing on the spot if I meet her.  I do have Dave Chappelle Season 1 on DVD. It didn't seem like anyone cared from my last post, but I like having it and think it's funny as hell. So next time you bitches are over we can watch it and enjoy a good laugh.  I did get a graduation invite from a chick I know in STL, although, I wasn't expecting it. I am going to call her tonight and figure out what the deal is. I know there has been some "good tension" going on, but nothing has ever happened. I'll have to be Inspector Gadget on this one. I'll refrain from any low brow humor with the "Go, Go Gadget...."  I do have some links up now for different people and different stuff if you want to check them out.  Lata playas

      I tell you what, the FDA better fix their  urlLink screw up . I understand some concerns about misuse, but hell people would find a way to do it anyway-over the counter or not. I think this would be a great thing to have out there and would not damper the safe sex train of thought. Mistakes happen in the heat of the moment and I am pretty sure most adults could admit to making a few. I think this would do more good than harm and obviously research is showing that.   If Bush and those religious nuts decide to get in the way, I hope they are prepared to duck for cover.  I swear religious zealots of any denomination really are asking to get an ass whoopin' and I am proudly ready to get in there and start dropping people with my size 13's. Worry about your own shit before telling people how to run their lives. Help people out when they need it or where something wrong is really occuring, but other than that fuck off.   Where's Jesus with a bullwhip when you need him?

      Well, being that work is very slow today, jeez couldn't be because of Mother's Day could it? I decided to get on the web, with the limited access I have, and read some current events. Well, I thought  urlLink this piece  was pretty interesting. Russia better go in and kill everyone or pull out. It's turning into another Afghanistan for them and most of us know how that turned out for Mother Russia.  Oh yeah, don't forget to scroll down, I have a few posts from Saturday some of yall might like to comment on.  Lata playas

I must admit I have been playing that JAY-Z song "99 problems" for 24 hours. For those of you who will see me this weekend, I will play it for you. Man that shit is dope.  "I didn't pass the bar, but I know a little bit-You ain't illegally searching my shit" "We'll see how smart you are when the canines come"  "I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one-hit me!"

      That's right. I ditched the gym yesterday to go to Best Buy and get Donnie Brasco and Chappelle Show on DVD. I also broke down and bought the new Jay Z record "The Black Album" because there is a killer track Rick Rubin produced called "99 Problems", which is basically Jay Z rapping over a rock loop-very good. ROCK A FELLA YALL!  Back to Dave-that DVD is great. There are out takes and all of the "Ask A Black Man with Paul Mooney", some of which never made the air. The funniest skit is still the Haters Ball-HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE!! lol One of the out takes had the guy playing Pitt Bull saying to Dave "Your Ho's look like a box of Skittles" then Dave says "I would say the same for you fat boy, but it looks like you already ate them" Then the entire set starts dying in laughter, to which I also started laughing greatly.  I didn't get kicked out of Jillians last night like I did the other time. It was a good time, had a couple of drinks and was social. Had 2 chicks that I work with flirt their asses off with me. Unfortunately, they were not hot. I did get one of the players cards and played this game in their back room from Sega, where you are some furturistic SWAT team guy blowing up stuff. I had a crowd gathered around me before I was out of tokens on the card. I was kicking ass, I was on point on my shots, really feeling the flow with the gun, etc-I pimped that game. The chick who the good bye party was for gave me a bear hug before I left. She was hammered, but she said she was going to miss me and that I was a big teddy bear.   I felt warm and fuzzy before going over to Back Door to play Foosball with Waggs, Steve-O, and Tip. It was my night, since the drink of the night for $2, was Vodka and choice of filler. I was a happy camper. I stuck around for a while and then went home to get some sleep before coming in here at 9am-man am I yawning.   Tonight, I have a graduation party to go to for a while and then hopefully out and about. I'll give yall players a call. Guys, don't forget Mother's Day is tomorrow-so get moving if you haven't already.   "I'M RICH BIATCH"

She's going out of town this weekend, which is why we'll talk on Sunday.  What's interesting is that I have the possibility of having something to do every night through next Monday.

      Well, I was watching TV this past Sunday with my friends, who were in town for Derby, and a commercial for Blue Rhino Propane came on. Now Blue Rhino is what you would use for your big outdoor gas grill. Now the voice of the narrator on the commercial sounded oddly familiar and sure enough it was John Goodman. Now I am just saying I am once step closer to the Zen of being one with Walter-I mean Walter and the Rhino in one commercial-what are the odds? However, I will still have to get married, divorced, be Jewish and be a Vet. Most of which, I am not willing to do, unless huge sums of money were thrown at me.  Also big ups to Red Sonja's site for listing me as Big Ride   Trump Tight

      Well I was off yesterday, which happened to be Cinco De Mayo, and I had a very interesting day. First I went to the gym and ran/jogged 3.5 miles. Pretty good for a big guy like me. I then went to go look for a card/ present for Mother's Day. My Hallmark Store got moved so I found another card store by Spencer Gifts. I hadn't been in Spencers in a while, so I went in to see what kind of posters the had. I lost my Goodfellas poster that had DeNiro, Liota, Pesci, and Sorvino, and I have been dying to get it back so that I can get it framed. Well, guess what. 20 posters in there it was. Now granted, not the same one I had in college, but close enough. After the mall I went home and clean myself up and just watched tv and some movies. Well, at 9 or so I was talking to Rhonda and watching The Whole 9 Yards, when some odd number came up on my cell. I didn't know who it was, so I kept talking to Rhonda. Then about 20 minutes after that another weird number popped up. Well, after I got done talking to Rhonda, I checked my voice mail and I had 2 messages-one from Jennifer B, who I haven't talked to in over a year and a half. The other was from Carolyn, whom I haven't talked to in over 2 months. It was very odd to talk to both of them. Carolyn was friendly, just didn't understand the ghost like stuff for this long. Jen, on the other hand, I think is up to something and I am totally suspect of why she is calling. If she wants to hook up for strictly sex-then I am okay with it, if she wants more than that-she can go jump off one of the bridges downtown. Anyway, from 9 until Midnight or so, I was drinking vodka and juice the whole time. I was surprised I wasn't flubbing my conversations. Anyway, that was my interesting night.  I will say that I have gone to the gym 2 days in a row, running a combined 7 miles for the 2 days. I plan on going again tonight and running a little bit. I get off at 8, I hate going that late, but I need to get in shape, especially, going to Miami in August. Need to look spiffy in my swim trunks. Later Yall

      The next quote is probably one of the top 5 funniest things I have ever heard and Dave Chappelle should do a skit on it.   We're sitting around last night and trying to figure out which French King wasn't legit when out of Waggs mouth came one of the most distrubing, yet hysterical, lines I have ever heard.   Peep Show Jizz Mopper   The whole table lost it and we, in a haze of tears and laughter, put that down for the answer, which was read aloud and horrified the rest of the bar. After that, we started thinking of bumper stickers, or how to explain at your 10 year reunion that you were actually working at a Peep Show doing that for a living. I haven't laughed that hard in a while.  My favorite bumper sticker would have been "My kid works as the Pee Show Jiz Mopper, where your Honor Roll kid jacks off" or "My kid beat the crap out of your Honor Roll Student with a Peep Show Jiz Mop"  It just went on for about 8 or 10 minutes before Waggs kept telling us we were wearing it out, to which I began laughing again and thus starting another round of hysterical laughter.  We should have won last night or finished in the top 3, if yall would have stuck with the original answers for the bonus-weak sister yall.  I am off work tomorrow, so yall have fun being a slave to the grind.

      What a weekend. It went by fast, but except for once instance it went well.  Friday I get off early and get home in time to see my friends rolling into my parking lot. We had reservations at Pat's Steakhouse at 9:00 pm, so being that it was 6:30, we cracked the Makers and started drinking and watched "The Big Labowski" to which almost everyone said I could be Walter. We all got a little buzzed and then got ready and went to dinner. All I have to say is that I think I ate half a cow there. The Fillet Minon(sp) was great, very juicy and the atmosphere was awesome. We then went over the Barons and checked out his party. I looked like UN huh? Trump Tight!! Then to Shenanigans for a couple of drinks and then home to get some sleep.  Saturday we got a late start on infield. Jager in the parking lot before walking from Papa Johns parking lot to the track. Once inside I won on races 6 and 8, got 4 numbers from some hot chicks, saw a lot of T&A&P. Stayed dry during the downpour. I did get some sun. After Derby went home, cleaned up, and went over to Buca's for dinner. Then went out to Saints and played some pool and had a few drinks. Came home around 2 and went to bed. My buddy Bryan woke me up around 3 to say there was a cop at the front door. I came to the door and the cops laughed at my tan, but said there had been a noise complaint. I said I had people over for Derby and we came home and went to bed. The cops went and got my jerkoff neighbor and he said that this was the second time in 6 months he had to tell me to be quiet. The cops looked at each other and shrugged and just looked like they couldn't believe they were called out for this. The cop standing by me had looked in to see that everyone was asleep and the lights were out. The cops then left and then I went back to bed. We all talked about what a pain in the ass he was and how much of a bitch he is. Everyone seemed to have a good time and left to go home.  I had a good time, I just hope my ASSHOLE neighbor realized he has strengthened my resolve to stay and to drive him out.  Hope everyone had a safe and Happy Derby  Pete

      I felt like starting a new post, but I was stumped for any kind of title.  Does anyone know how to let people view your profile off of your main blog? I have updated my profile, but can't find a way to get it where people can see it without making changes to it. Any help, as always, is appreciated.  My blog is now appearing on different web sites coast to coast. Who knew that a Rhino had such a wide roaming area. It's cool to see new people post on here. Some new flavor to the omelet.  Hung out with  urlLink Raul  and  urlLink Graham  for a bit last night. Raul is clearing up space in his pad for the soon to be Mrs. We saw this show that normally runs on Saturday night on KET called "The Red Green Show". It is Canadian, but it was very funny, so if you get a chance to watch it-worth your time.   I am still a little congested, but no coughing or headache, so I am much better. Thanks for the well wishes and notes. It takes a lot to remove this Rhino out of the game preserve.  Talked to Ms. Cincy last night. I will defer from using names until after the weekend. I will probably be going up there on Saturday instead of Sunday, but it all depends on her making up her damn mind. Note to the ladies-just make a decision and stick with it-please. It's not that hard, men do it all the time, it may not be right, but at least we don't spend more amounts of time going back and forth. When we make the wrong decision in a quarter of the time it takes you all to make the right one, that gives us the time to correct the mistake and taking half of the time of your alls decision. I digress and on to another topic.  Speaking of a new topic, I will have to think of something. 3..2..1..I have it. Everyone needs to get on  urlLink Church  for not posting over the last 3 days. Everyone else has, and I mean everyone, so why is Church so damn special? Get on his site and demand new material. All the rest of us have jobs and we are posting. He needs to get off his ass and get in gear. Viva La Revolution!!

      First of all, I want to say that I am sorry for the kid and his family. That being said,  urlLink the dad  reminds me of the Ron Goldman's dad during the OJ trial. Mr. Berg seems self centered and seems more concerned with his own agenda than what happened to his son. Also, his son went there of his own free will, as a civilian, not as military personnel. Besides, if any human doesn't think war is harmful, destructive, and bad, then that person is seriously warped. Many people and their families around the world have been devastated by this war and by many previous wars and many to come. I just think the guy sounds like a douche bag. I may be wrong, please tell me what you think.   urlLink This one , I just have always found a love of that city's name and would love to hear someone try to say it 3 times fast, especially drunk on tequila.  Like Raul, I am not that busy right now. I figured yall could use some good reading.

      mutha fucka  and now he is doing the voice over for Pontiac in some of their commercials. Talk about Trump Tight. I mean, who will get someone off their ass quicker to by a car than Sam Jackson. Could you imagine him coming into your house, as either Shaft or Jules, and yelling at you for not buying the GTO. The thought of it actually makes me laugh, assuming I wasn't on the end of his rant.  The GTO is out 5.7 V8, that is funny, because my brother's Ford Galaxy Custom 500 converts to that. Of course, it is much heavier than the GTO. I think Pontiac will tweak it out more next year and add more bells and whistles.  I still haven't seen the GXP, I think that is right, out on the market yet. It is a V8 as well and looks like a newer version of the old Grand Prix, before it went to shit in the new design. I don't know the 0-60 on it or any of the stats and dimensions, but I assume it's HP is around the high 2's or low 3's.   It's good to know Pontiac hasn't totally gone to shit. I still think they could do a lot to their interiors to compete with the Japanese and Germans. I mean, American car manufacturers need to really get into the game when it comes to that. I still say the Japanese have the most boring body designs next to Buick.   "That 151, just ain't no punk" Scarface of the Getto Boys.

      Yeah, I know, unoriginal title, but I am still groggy from the NyQuil I took last night. I am feeling better, but still not 100%. I left work last night, stopped by Walgreens picked up some Vapo Rub and the Quil and went home to try to heal myself. I hate Vapo Rub, but damn it, the stuff works. I took one shot of NyQuil and laid down to get some sleep. I forget what time I lost consciousness, but the next thing I know my alarm is going off this morning. My headache and most of my congestion is gone, but I still have some sinus problems, a cough, and I feel like I am high(that means the Quil is still in effect).  I may be bound for Cincy Sunday, assuming things are still a go. It should be interesting and fun, considering where I found out her piercings are.  Is anyone else thinking what a fucking big fat hypocrite Michael Moore is? If I ever meet that fat bastard, his 300 plus pound ass is going to get run over by this Rhino. How can you say you are a man of the people when you are a millionaire, run around with celebrities, and live in a gated community? Give me a fucking break Mike-you're a two faced douche bag like the rest of Hollywood, DC, West Palm Beach, the Hamptons, and every other community full of rich, white, bigots, who sit around and act like they really give a shit about anyone. Jeff Hostetler-you have a free pass now-because Michael Moore is now #1 on my shit list.  FUCK MICHAEL MOORE-FUCK HIM IN HIS BIG FAT EAR!!

      Well Saturday was the big day.  urlLink Raul's  Bachelor Party went off well, outside the fact that he was more sober than I thought he would or should be. I must give big props to Arru for making it all look flawless. BB's Bar-b-que was awesome, the Bats game was great, especially since Arru's photography skills are being put to use by Larry Flint-long story, then off to The Beer Depot for putt-putt, pool, foos, and drunkards, drunkards, every where and I didn't have a drink. Playing the DD was cool, I think anyone in my car for Motorhead's "Overkill" has hearing loss, but hey yall asked for it. Sunday, I woke up feeling very shitty, I think I have a sinus infection from smoking that cigar. Like  urlLink Graham , I haven't smoked in 3 or 4 years, so I think that is what caused it. Of course it may be a cold or the flu, but I highly doubt it. I don't think I will make it to Trivia tonight, because I feel like shit, due to the headache, not being able to breathe, etc. I am sure the team will done fine without me.  I am going to start getting to work and try to get most of my crap out of the way ASAP, so I can chill the rest of the day and do as little moving around as possible.  Later

      This has been a long day. I got up at 8:30, showered, folded laundry, and got ready to go out and find some curtains for my living room. I found some good curtains at JC Penny, but didn't find the right...alright, I am preparing for the jokes when I say this, rod. (I will give all of you with dirty minds like mine to laugh it up and prepare your comments) My living room window is 107 inches long by 52 inches tall, couldn't find anything that would fit the window. Sorry if I did not provide you all with more fodder mentioning rods and all.  I came into work and was met with a fire storm of s#@$. We have an issue with a business customer, which I will resolve. So I was in a meeting with my manager and on conference call with security for a good hour and a half. Then I had to run out to Oldham County and get that vehicle finally transferred. I waited 30 minutes to get to a clerk and another 15 to get it processed. I will get mileage for the trip and the clerk remembered me from earlier in the week and mentioned how much quieter it was this time. We both laughed over that one. Came back to the office and got debriefed over what I had missed for pretty much the whole day. Dealt with a few clients and cleaned up some paperwork.  My friend Emily in Cincy has a friend who I have been talking to this week. She seems nice and it looks like I have someone to have some fun with if I want to take the trek 120 miles North. That could be a serious option in the next 3 weeks and have some fun with no strings. She has some piercings in some interesting places, and God knows I love exploring.  Raul's Bachelor Party is tomorrow night, so it will be time to throw down and have some fun. Hope you all can make it.  Later

      I don't really, but I have been lacking sleep, sex, and the gym over the past few weeks and I just feel this lack of having a drink is slowly, but surely making me even more crazy and deranged than I originally was. My friend Kelly may come up from Tennessee this weekend. I'll keep you all posted. If she does, my not getting any streak will be down for the count. She is fun and she is cool, but I think a bit below what my standards are, but at this point, I am willing to stuff my standards in a crawl space for the time being. I think a really good carnal #@$! will do me some good. I digress, I am going to clean this place up and get out of here, I will post again tomorrow.  Audi S8

      Schwiggidy Schweet  My regional just emailed me to advise me that my bc was 4th in all of Louisville in profit YTD. That means I have hit all goals up to this point and I should be getting a nice bonus sometime in July or August. All I have to do is make sure nothing moves in a negative direction for 6 days and I am set. Man this has made my week. I do know we should be moving in a positive direction with some outstandings that should book within the next few days.  Best news I have heard at work in a while. Plus, everyone in upper management knows about it and I have gotten a few emails with congrats.  Sorry to be an ass and brag about it, but I am just very excited about it, and just wanted to share, more than anything. If I get the bonus in August, I will be drinking again, and a round or two will be on me.

      Sorry for my no posts on Monday and Tuesday, but yesterday I was barely in the office.  Had customer, who we have titling issues with. So my first leg of the journey is to drive downtown and get the paperwork I sent downtown back. I get down there in good time and find a parking meter on Muhammad Ali about 20 feet from 4th street-odds of that happening? My guess is 50:1. I get the paperwork and head back to the office, because the customer can't meet me until 2:30 at the Oldham County Clerks Office. I get some paperwork done and meet with a few customers and then head out at 2 pm to get to Lagrange by 2:30. I called the customer, who by the way said he wife would be meeting me, to let him know I would be about 10 minutes late, turns out I was only 3 minutes late-odds of that happening the way I drive 10:1. I did not realize all hell was about to break loose when I got there. The customer's wife is, in general, a pleasant woman. However, when it was found out that the dealership in Tennessee didn't return a signed VTR back. The State of Kentucky would do the transfer, but not at the sale price of the unit, they would do it at the blue books value, which would have been an extra amount out of the customer's pocket. 3..2..1..we have Super Bitch mode. She flipped out and kin a very raised voice said, to my and the clerks shock, "I'm not paying for this shit!" In the words of Keith Jackson of ABC "WHOA NELLIE!!" I reassured the customer that the dealership made the error and before I could even finish anything she shot back, "I don't care-I am dealing with you-it's your problem so fix it!" I then continued how I would overnight the form to the dealership and have them overnight it back. She continued, "I would hope so, we are going on vacation next week and I am not driving on expired tags and I am not coming back up here to do this-so you need to get this done!" The clerk looking shocked looked and me and said, "Just bring the VTR to me when you get it back and we'll wrap this up." I told her I would be back by Friday if things went well. I walked out with the customer and assured her everything would be fine. She continued to complain and then left. Didn't say, "Thanks for coming 25 miles out of your way to try to get this done today" "Sorry I flipped out" just left. I don't usually expect to be thanked for doing my job, and honestly I didn't feel like I was going that much out of my way, but when she went off like that I just felt like going off on her for being a rude bitch. I understand she needs these tags and that her and her husband wanted to get it all done yesterday, but I did everything right the first time and the dealership effed it up. What in the hell happened to manners, especially out in public.  This is where is gets real interesting, but cool. I start to drive out of Lagrange when I here a noise, not just any noise either, the noise you hear when you have a flat tire. "So I..pull over to the side of the road" sorry 99 Problems jumped into my head when I did that. I check all 4-nothing. I continue on and so does the noise. I pull over in the parking lot of a tire store and I go to look at the front drivers tire, since that is where it seems to be coming from, and sure as shit I hear the hissing noise of a tire loosing air and then I see it, a bolt, in my tire. No I am really angry, I need this like Kobe needs another white girl. This dude from the store, strolls over, this is the country you know.   So he says, "Well damned your luck on that one, pull your car over next to the pick up"  Me, "You have that model tire?" Him, "Naw man, we'll just patch it up for you-save you some time and money" Me, "Good deal"  These dudes were like a NASCAR pit crew. Before I had time to turn the car off, the jack was under the car and the guy was getting that phat daddy rachet that takes off the lug nuts. 15 minutes later I was ready to roll. I told the manager they did a great job and that if they needed something to call me as I handed him the business card. I get back to the office at 4, make a few calls and roll out to the gym.  At the gym I was thinking, how in the hell did you get all of the stuff done that you did in 8 hours, 2 hours of it being on the road. I didn't know how, but the thought of the day turning out right, even after being read the riot act, made me feel very content.   After working my ass of at the gym, made some soup, watched Gone in 60 Seconds, talked a little bit to Rhonda while having a couple of "Pop Ice". Yall remember them don't you? You get them in a box and they are like 100 in there and you store them in the freezer until they turn into popcicles-I love them. I then popped in Office Space talked to Kelly B and popped a great bag of popcorn-I mean all tasting great and only 10 or 15 kernels not popped-very Trump Tight.  Started good, ended good-just the way I like it.

      Well, you silly bastards pushed me to it and it will be here in 10 business days and you can bet your sweet candy asses that I am wearing it to trivia. You guessed it, the jersey of the greatest football player ever of the New York Giants Lawrence Taylor. Mr. 56, the man that changed the game of football and probably the greatest linebacker of all time. It's the home field jersey-old school-white with blue lettering with red etching. It will be Triple Titanium Trump Tight!!  I am going solo to  urlLink Raul's  wedding. I will also be sober, so that should greatly improve the odds of me not saying or doing anything asinine. Although, I am probably wrong.  Trivia tonight. If we play it right 4th week of being number one-I am pretty sure that has to be a record and we should get some kind of bonus money for that.  Steve-O, you better share the wealth with that Caroline chick. This woman was sexy, demure, gorgeous, etc. I didn't really have any in depth conversation with her, since like the rest of the group, we thought Steve-O was on a date and we didn't want to cramp his style. Don't think I don't see what you're trying to do Steve-O, it's slick alright, but almost Grace Slick to a point. Anyway, if you can get her to hang out more that would be very cool.  As for  urlLink Lepus'  site. I think I have lost 4 or 5 pounds since I did the no drinking think. Not a lot, but somewhat worth it. I am more edgy not having the stuff in my system. I am getting a contact buzz from gargling with Listerine lol. My thing is getting into the gym more often. I have to stick to it and unfortunately I was a slacker last week. Regardless, I will stay in the gym. I have gotten good results from it over the past 5 years, can't say that it was a quick drop in weight, but I am more in shape than I was when I was 21, which is a great thing.   urlLink Raul's  Bachelor Party this weekend, I am sure that will be interesting to report on.  Oh yeah, if you know anyone, that is responsible of course, that is looking for an apartment to share with someone, let  urlLink Church  know ASAP. With Jay moving out, Church would have to front all of the rent, and that just ain't right, so if you hear anything, let the man know.  Later yall

      First of all my apologies to  urlLink Chruch , for missing the screening last night of Phantoms, I heard Affleck was da bomb in Phantoms. I crashed on my couch once I got home looking at blinds, etc for the windows. I have just been tired lately and I am not sure what the cause is.  Almost got busted by 5-0 this morning. Coming from B-boro Rd on Watterson, this cop was in the middle of the median towards the mall. Well, he busted on the lights and I pulled over to the left emergency lane and 2 seconds later he went right past me. I thought he was going to nail that cherry red Mustang that had been in front of me. However he pulled no one over, not me or the Mustang. Both of us were doing at least 70 or 80 when we hit past him. I proceeded on my way as the cop drove down Watterson West bound. I saw him looking around inside his car, so I am counting my blessings that either he missed me or just wanted everyone to slow down. Either was, no ticket for the Rhino-thank you God.  Remember we have  urlLink Raul's  bacherlor party next Saturday-this will be a good time, so I suggest all yall mo fo's get your asses in gear and get with Arru about RSVP-ing to that. Also get those wedding invites mailed back to Will and Beth-July 1 is the deadline, but let's all act like our mamma's raised us right and get it back to them this week.  Have no clue what the plan is for tonight, I guess I will wait and see. I know I have to get into the gym today, this may be the source of my sloth as of late. Need to get the blood pumping.   Still looking at getting more ink added on to my body, around my current one, not a new one or anything. If I get something done, I will post it, but it's not like I have  alot of time to go look in order to get a new tattoo, so that may have to wait until the fall.  Audi S8

      Well, the Lakers are finished and the Detroit Pistons are NBA Champs. Never seen another team get beat so bad in my life. I feel bad for the LA Fans, they should get their money back for LA not showing up at all in the finals. I mean Detroit was up by 28 at one point in the 4th quarter.   There were several firsts for this series.  1) Larry Brown is the first coach to win an NCAA and NBA title-can anyone tell me which college team? 2) Since the final series went to a 2-3-2 format, Detroit is the first to win all their home games. 3) Phil Jackson has never lost an NBA finals appearance as a coach.  I am still debating blinds or curtains for my living room-any suggestions?  Any word for the weekend yet? I am still date hunting for the wedding. I should have a resolution by the end of the night tonight.  Audi S8

      Well, this was an interesting weekend.  Detroit is now up on LA 3-1, to all you Laker fans, just learn to deal with defeat graciously. If LA spent more time passing the ball, selecting their shots correctly, etc. they would be winning, instead of losing.  Helped Jay move in to his new place-with the rain and the angles of him being on the second floor, that was a pain in the ass, but it really didn't take us that long.   Saturday night was crazy with Tip and Steve-O trading off on Irish Carbombs-5 a piece, it got real messy real quick and I was glad I was sober to try to control it with the help of Church and Graham.  Sunday, woke up to hear the phone ring and my Dad telling me that my parents were going to stop by and visit. Talk about hauling ass. They showed up 45 minutes later and I had everything spic and span. Not that the pad was that messy, but had to make sure the living room got picked up. Raul was cool enough to have people over for food and movies. Thanks again, it was a good time, but the hang over from the Ether was a bitch-lol  Monday kicked ass. Hung some stuff up, bought some new stuff with some gift certificates, and showed up to Trivia where we placed 1st, for the 3rd week in a row. I love getting a free meal on Mondays. Church, Graham, Steve, and myself, rallied from a crappy first round. Had to be the worst 1st round our team has had in over a month, but we still managed to be in 3rd. We got most of the bonus questions right and stuck to the wager wisely strategy that has gotten us a top 2 finish for the last 6 weeks.   Tonight, the gym and seeing if Detroit can wrap the NBA season up with a win in Detroit. For the record, Jimmy Kimmel is right, they would have a riot in Detroit if they win.  Mercedes will be releasing the SLR McClaren this fall or this summer, I will have to consult back to the article and let you all know more. It is a bad ass looking car, I can say that.  Later yall

      Well, whew what a week. Pretty much, work wise, this has been one of my worst weeks ever, but I digress. My name is in the running for a promotion. My bosses boss said he put me in for it because he thinks I would do well. That really helped make things better here.  In the news Ronald W Reagan (40th US President) passed away and everything has been covered showing the viewing and the funeral today. Margaret Thatcher and Brian Mullrooney gave great speeches and had some great stories and kind words to say about Mr. Reagan. I think Clinton fell asleep during the funeral. No offense he looked stoned at the beginning of it. I still can't believe the casket Reagan is in weighs over 650 pounds-that's nuts. If I was placed in it and laid still that thing would almost weigh 900 pounds. It was very sad to see Nancy touch the casket the other day, she reminds me of my grandmother, god rest her soul, looking very fragile and petite, but at the same time looking very alert. My heart goes out to her, because the both of them were very much in love, and I would hope to find someone that I loved that much.  Ernie Fletcher almost got turned into bar-be-que by violating the no fly zone over DC. However, reports came back that the FAA waived the plane in, but opps, forgot to tell the military boys with the F-16's and the sidewinder missiles.  Chronicles of Riddick comes out this weekend-if I can I am there.  Detroit is up 2-1 over the Lakers and have had a command over the whole series. It should be 3-0, but it is what it is with Detroit losing Game 2 this past Tuesday.  Graham has his own Blog now and it is linked over to the right under, yup you guessed it, Graham. Welcome aboard Captain Stubing.  Rhonda stopped by last night to check out my condo and watch the first half. Very cool of her to stop by. She was intrigued that I had my Playboys on a bookcase. I thought it was cool she read the latest one ;)  Other than that, nothing new. Still trying to score a date to Raul's wedding, but if there will be a bunch of cute single female teachers there I may not.  Audi S8

      Well, Monday was crazy here at the office, so I do apologize for any lack of posts. Let me run down the last few days for yall and get some of you up to speed.  Saturday-worked all day, went to the gym for a hour and a half, watched Smarty Jones come one length away from becoming the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978, and went to a couple bars with  urlLink Church  and Jay.  Sunday-worked all day, then cleaned some stuff up around the house, watched the Sopranos season finale, which was very good, and the watched Detroit beat the crap out of LA. All was good at this point.  Monday-worked all day, catch the theme of this post, then went with  urlLink Raul  and the crew to Trivia to put the smack down on  urlLink Tha Sci . I give major congrats to  urlLink FJH aka Lepus  for coming up with an answer maybe only one other person knew. The song "It's My Job" was sung by Jimmy buffet or Conway Twitty. I am still kinda in shock over that one. I will say I knew that Connecticut is "The Nutmeg State". Again, our team wins a free bar tab for next week. 5 weeks straight placing 2nd or higher. What can I say, we're all smart. Maybe next week Tha Sci will come strong. I am waiting for another team to step up to the plate and give us a real challenge.  I'm off this weekend. I know I need to do a couple small things around the place, but other than that I am up for whatever. I really want to go back to bed. Eventually I will make it home and get to lie back down.

      I couldn't really think of anything whitty to put as the title for this one. I tried, but it just didn't work. So where did track 14 come from? It's the last song on the Black Album and it is stuck in my head due to the haunting rift on it-very blues-I need to find out who recorded that song that they got it from. We've been slammed all day, I know we should be, because it is Friday, but due to the fact that last Friday was before a holiday weekend, odds are we should have been this slammed last week. Anyway, I am working all weekend, which isn't too great, but it is what it is and I am sure I will get some things caught up and some things cleaned up around here.  So I got to listen to the Gray Album by Danger Mouse yesterday and it is great. My brother is going to burn me a copy and I will let you all hear it. Don't start rolling your eyes about how you hate rap or hate the Beatles, etc., just listen to it, you will be surprised. I am sure that once MJ and Jay Z's teams hear this things they will cut some deal and put it back on the shelves-it would sell rather well.  I did have a married woman come on to me today and I was flattered, but at the same time, I do have some kind of principles. Not to say her advances were blunt, but it was obvious what her point was. Very pretty for her age, but again-no dice-not the right thing to do. Is it hard to find some single women in my age bracket to have a no commitment relationship with? Dates, sex, etc, but not be totally exclusive or very serious? I seem to be very popular with the women 35 and up or the 20 something divorcees with kid(s), but you can't tell me there aren't some 24-30 year olds that are single? And family wonders why I don't settle down-shit!  Well, I think the no drinking, combined with the work out and diet is working. I am not really dropping pounds-just 3 or 4, but I can tell the difference in the mirror, a little more tone, muscles looks bigger, etc. I think I am going to take some Polaroids and then do it again in a month and compare the differences. I really do want to get into shape for the beach, then again, who doesn't.  Hope everyone has a great weekend. Tonight I am going to chill at my place. If anyone wants to stop by for a bit you are more than welcome to.  Audi S8

      Well I called my brother to make sure he could drive me to the airport when I go on vacation in August. We were going over the details, when I heard some recognizable music in the background. I asked him if he was listening to Jay Z, in particular, the Black Album, to which he said kinda. Now I was thinking he was being a smart ass, to which he further commented that it was a tape from Danger Mouse. Now for all you old skoolers out the Danger Mouse used to be a cartoon show back in the 80's about a super agent mouse and his bummbling side kick named Pumphrey or something of the like. Well there is a DJ or musician out of NYC calling himself that. What he seems to have done is mixed the Beatles "White Album" with Jay Z's "Black Album" and created the "Gray Album". Here's where it gets fun. Since Michael Jackson owns most of the Beatles publishing rights he sued, Jay Z got wind of it and he sued. I actually think Damon Dash sued instead of Jay, since Damon seems to be more of a prick. Anyways, the album got yanked due to the legal shit, but somehow, my crafty little brother got a copy of it and is going to let me listen to it. I'll give yall the scoop once I hear it

      Well, I have been to the gym 2 days straight and I have seen some very good things, a couple of bad things, and some ugly shit.  First, the good. I ran into Catherine at the gym, she is very hot by the way and if I get my chance I would let her be my suga momma, since she has some dough.  Yum!  Also, there have been other attractive women in there working out.   Now the bad. Guys, although women could be at fault on this as well, but I doubt it. When you go to a gym, put the weights back on the rack. Almost broke my neck on Tuesday tripping on a couple of weights left on the floor. Also, this shit about screaming or grunting loudly when you are lifting weights is  bullshit , especially when you are squatting what I benchpress. I mean for Christ's sake I don't get all noisy when I have 465 up on the bar and am doing my calf work out, so don't start making noise when you have 135 up. Also, ladies, please shut up on the cardio equipment. I don't care if you have some conversation, but I don't want to hear about your kids, women issues, yadda, yadda, yadda. Oh, and for those about to comment, I wasn't trying to listen in, they were talking loud enough to be heard half way across the place.  Everyone, please be courteous when you go to the gym with what you wear. Now I know that I do not have the perfect body, I know I need to work on my abs. This being said, I don't run into the gym shirtless. Of course if my obliques came down a little bit I might. There were at least 3 chicks in the gym between yesterday and Tuesday, that thought they looked great. WRONG!!! When you have thighs that are bigger than my chest (46 inches) and have more cottage cheese than Deans makes in a year,  don't wear short shorts!!  I mean that's just gross. Also, don't wear tight tops when you have a gut like John Goodman's. Who in the fuck wants to see that shit? I know I don't. Plus, expect for someone to make a comment that will offend you. This actually happened and I didn't say it. Tuesday, these 2 dudes said some stuff about this chick wearing short shorts, or at least they looked that way on her, they could have probably fit me fine. She took issue about it and of course it went from there. Maybe they were wrong, but her oozing out of those things like jelly from a jar didn't help her case.  There are plenty of people who are fat that work out, I mean that's good, they are trying to improve themselves bit by bit and I applaud their efforts, but please use the good god damn sense God gave you and have some courtesy, some sympathy, and some taste when you roll out to the gym.

      Now before I go on a rant about politics, Mike Tyson, work, women, etc, I am going to talk about what happened when I left work yesterday and got home.   WARNING -The following content is profane and will offend most of the general population. If you are weak willed, ill, pregnant, about to be pregnant, old, or a minor-please stop reading now. The content has been approved by Rhino Inc and is solely meant for this viewing audience. Any reprint or reproduction without permission is against the law.  Point 1) Yesterday was shit at work, although it was proven that I am the fuckin' man in the clutch, it was still bullshit. Mortgage brokers are mainly morons, impotent fat fucks, and people that think they can all become real estate tycoons. I drive home and pull into the parking lot and there is a shitty Ford Taurus sitting in my parking space. Bye-bye reason, bye-bye clean mouth..."Let's get ready for a tirade......." I drop my shit up in my place and start calling a towing company. You wanna play games, I hope you're wearing protection. They company I calls can't do it, but gives me the number for another place. I call St. Matthews to make sure I am within my rights, they say call Metro. Dispatch for Metro rings 8 or 9 times before I hang up. I am starting to call the other towing company, when my downstairs neighbor, who I really don't like tells me a nice little story about how the fucking bitch in 201 A has been parking back in my spot and other people's spot during the day. I say, which one is hers and my neighbor points. I then go to her back door and start pounding on the thing. I do this three times before I walk to the front door and proceed to do the same thing-no answer. I see if the association office is still open, which they are not. So I walk back down to her place with a note demanding she move her car. I get to the door and hear music playing, where as before it was a tv. I proceed to really hammer the door this time. Within seconds the door opens and the 5'2 20 something is staring at me.  Me "Do you own the Ford Taurus" Her "Yes" Me "I need you to move it right now" Her-gives me a funny look like she wants me to fuck off Me-in a clear, authoritative, sort of loud voice- "You're in my spot" Her "Ok" then shrugs her shoulders and gives me another look. Me-walks away to my car  Let me tell yall something in case you don't know. If you fuck with my stuff, be prepared for me to get angry. The best way to avoid me kicking your ass is to just comply and fix what you did wrong immediately. Otherwise, I have no problem beating the fuck out of you until you're not moving or dead, whichever-I don't give a fuck.  5 minutes later that business class cunt saunders her way out and moves her car. Brooke, which is her name, I hope by some stroke of divine intervention from God himself, leads you to read this. If you ever park your fucking car in my space again, so help me God, I will destroy your car, break down the door to your home, and shake you like a rag doll until your fucking neck breaks, you fucking teeny-bopper sorority skank. Do not fucking mess with my shit bitch-I can and will take it to the next level. To quote GNR "You wanna fuck with me, don't fuck with me, if you had better sense you'd just step aside and just let me be" You have been warned.  Oh yeah she drives probably an 02, Tan, Ford Taurus with Alabama Plates that expire in November 04 Plate number 38B9976. I am having those checked by the way.  I digress. I would not and do not advocate physical violence against anyone man or woman. I believe as an adult we can all politely work out our problems. However, fuck with my family, home, car, body, or livelihood, I can't promise I won't break my rule.  Point 2) Mike Tyson fought here last night and lost, shock there, what I thought was interesting is that Mike Tyson is my height and weighs about what I do, but is pure muscle, whereas I am not. Just proves that the BMI Index is total bullshit.  Point 3) Ladies, why do I get these sob calls at night about how your life sucks, you hate your current boyfriend, fuck buddy, fiance, etc? Stop it. I don't care. You already know what I think and how I feel about it. You're a grown woman and can take care of this shit without whining and crying to me. Don't call me with that shit ever again. I know I listen well, but I have better things to do, even if I am sitting at home watching a movie. Yall wonder why I don't pick up the phone for numbers I don't know? That's why, and I am sticking to my new policy of letting the machine or voicemail get it.  Point 4) Why, oh why, are some of you determined to be lemmings or sheep and just follow your political party around like they are good people. They are not, so stop fucking saying they are. The DNC put on a shameless display this past week and I am sure the RNC will do the same whenever the hell there's is. Who in the fuck uses kids to get adults to do what a politician wants? The Nazis, Big Business, Media Companies, and the DNC. They put a 13 yr old reject from Annie up on the podium to bitch about Dick Cheney. God willing I ever have children, I hope to protect them and give them the ability to make up their own minds on what they want, than to sell them out to a political party. I mean that is fucked up yall. Then we have Sharpton, Jackson, Gore, and the rest of these dipshits saying how much the Democrats care-are you out of your fucking mind?! Also, Republicans want to re-institute slavery, reverse the ERA, and basically make us poor. Oh yeah, I forgot, the Democrats are for the people-right. How mindless do you think I am John Kerry or any of you political fucks for that matter. Your all, Republicans and Democrats, full of hate, mis-information, greed, lies, etc.  Come November, I know how we can take the country back. Vote None of the Above. I know I am ripping off "Brewster's Millions", but damn it, it's a great idea. Why not take back the government with a huge show of no confidence in any of these rich, fat, mostly white fuckers. If we get everyone that is registers and votes to write in anyone elses name other than Kerry and Bush, we will be able to choose who we want. If you think this is a bad idea, I would love to hear suggestions. If you think George Bush or John Kerry gives a rats ass about you for anything else than your robotic ability to get them back in power or making money you are full of shit and very slow. These guys are assholes and shouldn't be allowed to be in charge of a paper route. Most of the Kerry supporters, sorry it's true, are easily led. I admit to voting for Bush in 2000, because I hate Al Gore, fuck that douche bag. However, I don't want him back in or Kerry taking over the seat. We need a change in this country and until everyone realizes what kind of shit we're in and what it will take to get out of it, we're all screwed, our kids will be screwed, and our grandkids. This is not how it is supposed to be. We must present a unified front against the career politicians like Mitch McConnell, John Kerry, Ted Kennedy, Jeb Bush, etc. These guys are fucking us over hard and there is no end in site, unless we all get together. I have heard so many people say how the 2 parties are exactly alike, how they are sick of choosing between piece of shit candidate A and piece of shit candidate B. Well, if you want to do something about it, we have 3 months to get going and get None of the Above on tha ballot in every state.  I feel much better.  Point 5) I will get GI Joe today. Tomorrow around 5, show up and we'll watch it and have a few drinks. If you want beer or something else, BYOB. I only have Jager and Makers.

      I was thinking, if I get GI Joe Season 1 part 2, anyone up for coming over Sunday when I get off work to&nbsp;watch it? We could start the viewing at 5 pm. I have the room to seat 7 comfortably in the living room now.&nbsp; I think that would be tight to drink some whiskey and watch the epic struggle between Tha Joes and Cobra.&nbsp; I think this would be Trump Tight, but if not we can always try for the weekend after I get back from vacation.   Well, what do you all think? Leave your thoughts in the comment section posted below and we'll get a plan together, because knowing is half the battle.   Oh yeah another 53 hours and it's drinking time.

      I leave for two days and everyone's blog goes crazy. My two days off were very busy, productive, and somewhat nerve racking. I have had to get a lot of stuff done in those days before I went on vacation next week.   Tuesday, the first thing I did was get my dry cleaning in. I probably won't pick it up until Friday, but it got in, which is always the hardest step for me. After that I stopped by my folks house to shoot the shit with my brother and then off to Sears to find a new dryer, dishwasher, and possible washer. I had done some research online first and they were the best place to go. The sales people there were really cool and didn't give me a lot of hassle. I just ended up getting a new dryer. It would have cost me more than a C-Note to get the combo and my washer is pretty new and in good condition. After that, I moved over to the dishwasher section and got a new one as well. The dishwasher wasn't in stock and it should be in tomorrow, which means I might have it installed on Monday. Trying to get everything scheduled got me a little stressed due to my car going in to the shop on Wednesday, the new tint on Thursday, and me working every day this week. After that, I went and got my haircut. I wanted to give it sometime to grow before going on vacation, plus it was long enough to get cut. Later in the afternoon I went to go get the couch and chair that Raul and the Mrs. said I could have. My brother and I went and grabbed it and moved it over to my place. Many thanks again for the really good furniture-looks great.   Wednesday, took my car in and they reconnected the trunk release button on the driver's door. It took them 15 minutes and I was back to my place to wait for the dryer to be delivered. Those guys were awesome-in and out in 10 minutes flat. My new dryer's new favorite feature is that when you open the door a light comes on inside the dryer. I know, I know, I am easily amused, but I have never had that on a dryer before, it is cool. I like it. I got my laundry started and went to the gym. I got back grabbed some grub, watched Serpico with Pacino and talked on the phone for a bit.  Vaction is next week and I am going to start prepping for the trip. I do need to grab some booze to take with me, but that can wait until Monday. Can't wait to hit the bottle and the beach and just relax and do nothing for 6 days.

      Well, I have to concur with my colleague Raul on where is Waggs? The link to his blog is out and I am not sure why. Can anyone offer a reasonable explanation to this occurance? Has anyone spoken to the man himself about this? We need to launch a full scale investigation and make sure Waggs is alright and get the man back online.   11:15 Addendum:   Waggs' site crashed. He will be working to get it back up soon. Please send all donations to the following-  Help Waggs get his site back up c/o Rhino 78 Safari Preserve Kenya Africa  Money, food, booze, and women are greatly appreciated.

       urlLink Raul  was nice enough to let me take a look at some furniture that will no longer be needed at the Scurvy residence. A nice couch and chair. The preserve is in need of more seating for the spectators, so I will get those moved hopefully in the next few days. They are in great condition and will go nicely in the living room. Thanks Raul for that, much appreciated. Once those are in I may have to have everyone over for a GI Joe Season 1 Part 2 viewing and alcohol consumption.   On the down side, my dryer is out, done, finished, so I guess I get to spend money getting that replaced, which means I will&nbsp; get a new washer as well, since that is usually more economical to buy the pair than just buy one. If I do that , does anyone need a washer?  If so say something now, or else I will have the dudes haul it away. I also figure since I will be having that stuff delivered, I will break down and get the new dishwasher, since I have been holding off spending a C note or 2 getting one. Can't say that this Rhino doesn't do his part to keep the preserve looking good and upgrading the facilities.  I am off tomorrow and Wednesday, so more peace and quiet for you all. I hope to get everything done I need to, since next week I am on vacation.&nbsp; Keep me posted on if any of yall are takers on the washer.   On a side note, I am coming up fast on Post 200, so I will have to think of something crazy to do for that.

      That was a big phat daddy big boy yawn.   Well last night The Baron and the Mrs. stopped by to check out the crib and graciously brought&nbsp; a bottle of fine Hungarian wine. Church, Kelly, and Jen stopped by as well. I believe everyone had a good time with all of the varied discussions. I see that the ladies really love the Cheese Its. The ones last night were Cheddar Jack. Mmm, mmm Good!   Everyone bugged out around 11:30 and I cleaned some stuff up and went to bed. Got up at 6 to help my friend Bert, no not Coomes, move some furniture for his parent's garage sale. I have been friends with him since before he was born. Our parents have been friends for years, so they are all like family. I helped them get the stuff set up. I haggled with an old guy about wicker chairs for like 5 minutes, but he paid what I told him. I kept doing the $20 each or 2 for $35. Works every friggin time. Anyway, his mom got Mickey Dees, which rocked, since I had left without getting to eat my toasted bagel with cream cheese. Around quarter till 8 I left to come here.   For those of you not in my area, the weather is awesome. Clear skies, sunny, a nice breeze and I think it's 72 outside right now. Awesome weather and we are sitting here bored out of our minds looking at it.   I heard V-Groove played last night at Headliners. I will check and see if they are tonight. If so-let's all roll down there and have some fun.

      I know I write more than some of you all do, and far less than others. I talk a lot, so it is not really surprising-right?&nbsp;Sometimes, I feel like I have something to say that is important, that you all would want to know about, or that I just want to get something out and hope someone listens.   You know, this is short to the amount of thoughts and things I want to talk about, but don't for whatever reason. With my discussion with Kim last night, I thought about how I would love for my writing to be well done, succinct, precise, and organized, but my head just doesn't work that way. I try to get all these thoughts out and try to do it the right way, but it doesn't seem to work out like that.   CC Deville from Poison once said in an interview "I had all the right influences and I know how I wanted it to sound, but it sounded like shit when it came out."   Now I am not saying his is a total shit guitar player, because I like some of his solos on their albums, but he's no Hendrix, Clapton, Page, etc. I guess I feel that way when I talk and right, I have all the right stuff to make it right, read some great authors, was taught by some fine teachers and professors, but it doesn't come out as well as I think it should.

      Yesterday ended on a good note, with much being done at work, good sales, etc, etc. Plus I had everyone in stiches with my version or Al Gore and Gomer Pile having an arguement over who invented the internet. I go leave work and decide to get groceries, but I go home first to make sure power is still on because of the storm. I know, I know, but there were 2 traffic lights out and this made me paranoid. Kim called my cell so we talked while I shopped, she thought I was Martha Stewart's new prison bitch, being all domesticated and all, but hey a Rhino has to eat. I did forget to get eggs. I love making scrambled eggs and omelets when I have&nbsp; a day off. I am pretty good at cooking both and always try to add different ingredients to get a good flavor, because eggs can be bland sometimes. Kroger's has some kickass deals on Red Baron pizzas-FYI. Kim and I talked for a while, said good night,&nbsp;and then I straightened the place up a bit before going to bed, due to the Baron and the Mrs. stopping by tonight, as they have not see the preserve since I bought it.   The bad part, is I will not be getting Monday off, as originally planned, so this adds another day to my streak which will end at 12 days in a row. The good thing is I will be off Tuesday and Wednesday. I have to get my windows re-tinted in my car, so Wednesday I have to be up early, but Tuesday, I can actually sleep in. Another bad thing is trying to get all of these outstanding loan files cleaned up, catch some delinquents that owe the company money, finish up my customer complaints file, and clean up 2 of my holdover accounts. I need to get this all done in the upcoming week before I go on vacation. The only problem is that gives me4 working business days to tie it all up. And you thought going from Atlanta to Texarkana and back hauling Coors in 24 hours was rough.  Elizabeth Hurley you ask? Well I had another re-occurring dream last night. I was in a house and trying to convince this very elderly wealthy woman to invest with me. I have had this dream once or twice before. She said she wanted to keep it secure, the market, yadda, yadda, but I kept pressing and she was buying into my pitch. The I feel this hand on my shoulder and it's Elizabeth Hurley asking if I was trying to con her Grand Mum-she even looked hot in my dream. I said no and then suddenly we're walking around, her arm wrapped around mine and her head leaned against my shoulder and we're just talking. Then there are all of these people in a buffet line, like we're at a business seminar. So we get plates and go to sit down. I then realize I need something to drink and ask her if she wants anything she smiles and says no. I go get me a glass of water, then I am back in my chair and my food is gone and so is Elizabeth and I say WTF really loud and someone says, oh you're at the wrong table your stuff is over there. I did a double take because I thought they were wrong, but there at the other table, which seemed 20 yards away, was my food. I get up to go get it and then I woke up. Yeah, beats the hell out of my what that meant or why I had it either, but it was cool to be chilling with Elizabeth Hurley.   Have no real clue what is up for the weekend, besides work. I do know I need to start getting ready for my vacation to Florida, which is in 10 days. Sweet. Everyone have a good one and I'll talk to yall later.   PS: Almost forgot-you, yeah you know who you are-you lost our bet and owe me, my question is how are you going to pay up? Don't give me any red tape either, well maybe some. Email me and we'll discuss.

      Well kiddos today has been busy as hell for me. Between me and Raul throwing crack left and right at each other, Graham planning a football trip, and trying to schedule furniture stuff, I have been actually working. I got some really good sales, closed $140,000 worth of loans, solved a lot of customer issues, and cleaned up some loose ends. I even had one customer drop of a bottle of Makers in appreciation of me helping him out. It's nice to bust your ass, have a shit load of stuff, and have all of it come to furition. It makes all of the mental strain worth it.   Like Cube said "Today was a good day"  True it's not over I still have another 2 hours and 15 minutes left, but it's down hill from here.   &nbsp;

      I am getting tired of talking about politics and LG&amp;E, but not to tired to talk about  urlLink this  asshole. I knew they had a lead down in Tennessee, but I didn't know they caught him, glad they did.   From what I understand police here are 98% sure this prick did it. This cocksucker beat to death a woman and a kid. I hope they just give him life so his fellow inmates can show him that real men are a little harder to beat up. I hope they beat him for a couple of hours and then throw him off a second or third tier at the state prison. This guy looks like a douche bag and someone should kick his ass for his smug, smartass look. Muthafucka I hope he gets everything he deserves and more. Punk. WTF is wrong with people these days? My question is-has society really gotten worse, or do we just see way more footage of the bad stuff people have always been doing? I know the media hypes stuff up, but this year it seems like some crazy shit is going around here in the county.

      Jesus H Christ, if I get one more email from you naive tree huggers with this title I am going to explode. How cute that 60's protest limerick are back in style. We're going to change the world with John Kerry, he can do anything. Yeah, I like politicians that will come take my money, let big business do what they want, and totally screw me, but at least it isn't Bush, who's controlled by big bushiness-yeah like Kerry isn't?   First of all, how stupid is this-there are quiet a number of people in Clinton's own administration that died mysteriously. Anyone remember Vince Foster or Ron Brown?? Also, does no one remember&nbsp;that little peace keeping mission in Yugoslavia? I guess no American died there in a land where the people there have been fighting and killing each other for centuries right? Our country has never butted where it didn't belong or stepped into the middle of a century old feud? I guess every war was moral and wasn't about rich people getting richer and politicians getting re-elected so they could get more money&nbsp;for themselves and their real bosses the&nbsp;Global Corporations, who couldn't give a fat fuck about us or our country.   Spanish American War, WWI, WWII, Korea, Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, Grenada, Gulf 1, Somalia, Yugoslavia, Iraq no fly zone, Gulf 2, etc. These were all to stop evil despots, help innocent people, and make the world a more happy sunshiny place right? None of these had anything to do with saving the vested interests of big, global companies right? None of those were fought because rich people said "Hey we could make some serious dough if you went in and kicked out whoever and let us in to "help the people"? Also, all of these wars were started by Republicans right? Oh wait-no, no, and no-opps my bad, all of these were done by rich, fat, greedy, sell out, old white guys who knew they and their families would be safe while they sent regular people to die and made money doing it. But the Democrats didn't put us in a long extended war right. Hmm, I wonder if a Democratic President got us into Nam, then another one screwed around because he was from Texas and knew how to win a war better than military officials, and then a Republican got us out? Don't you see these SOB's are all the same.   Are you blind to the fact that there are no term limits and that the only people that could make that effective are the same people who don't want them. What about campaign finance reform?-oopps same people. Politicians care about one group of people-themselves. If think there is a difference between the Democrats and the Republicans, then you are blind, deaf, and dumb. Last time I checked all&nbsp;these&nbsp;men and women&nbsp;had a couple of homes, wore Armani, drive really expensive cars, when they aren't being chauffeured around, and fly on private jets-ON OUR MONEY!!   You don't like or hate Bush fine, but let me remind you that everyone before him was a greedy little bastard too. You can argue which ones you like better, but in the end, every single one of them has stripped off a little piece of the constitution and our rights so they could make themselves more money. They have weakened this country so they could get paid by the highest bidder, no matter what happened to us or how many of us have and will die. To them money talks-period. Does anyone else not see this? I mean they are restricting what we can do, while they move above the law and do what they please.   So go ahead and say your politician is a good person, that he cares about you and your cause, but try to just walk in and see you buddy unannounced and see how far you get. Does your favorite politician that represents your area even live in your area? Can you go to the club where your favorite politician plays golf? etc. etc. etc. I bet the answer is no to&nbsp;most or all of them.&nbsp;   Believe what you want, but by making Americans think one party is good and the other is bad or that one party is for me as an individual, is exactly what keeps them in power and from us, the citizen base, from cleaning up this mess and trying to get America back to the way it should be. The electoral process needs to be totally overhauled-term limits, campaign finance reform, open books on who is giving money, and more than two very similar parties-we need 5. The more power we take out of their hands, the more we put back into our own. We have enough to clean up and take care of in this country and we need to start doing it now, before it's too late to fix it.   I'll get off my soap box now, until another naive dumbass sends me an email about how crappy Bush Jr is and how great Kerry will be. Speak about literally being in bed with big business.

      Well yesterday was a good day.&nbsp; &nbsp; Work was busy, but we got a lot done and I got some really good sales.&nbsp;  I got home to change for Trivia, when I saw my answering machine was blinking. Honestly, I thought it was Church, until I heard that the call came at 2 or 3 in the afternoon. It was a woman's voice saying she was with LG&amp;E-fuckin a I thought not again with "We wanted to confirm that your power was back on", but it wasn't-it was Vic Staffieri's secratary. She was calling to say he recieved my letter and that he would be getting back with me this week. I was stoked. My goal was pretty much accomplished. He now has to deal with me, good or bad, I got to the boss and now he has to address me. The more I think about it, I doubt he will call, that it will be one of his "assistants", but no matter Vic read my letter.  &nbsp;  I went to Trivia and told  urlLink Graham ,  urlLink Church , and Steve-O that and they all say I am doomed now to be forever without power. However, I think with all of the bad press Vic will just want to make sure I am not going to go screaming mad to the press, which has happened twice already here in town. Funny when those people did that. LG&amp;E had their power restored within an hour of the camera crew showing up. We placed 3rd, which was good, hopefully we will do better next time.  &nbsp;  Steve-O said he had not read my letter, and I figured why not. Listed below is the letter. Please do not be my High School English teacher, just read it and realize that I am not as low brow, crass, and etiquette challenged as some of you believe. I can be quite shrewed when it comes to business deals. Writting is always better for me because&nbsp;I have time to think about what I write, versus speaking and inserting a size 13 shoe in my mouth. Just remember that if a company, politician, etc. really pisses you off, you should do something about it. Letters have worked in the past for me and I will continue to write when a company does something that I feel is very egregious. Anyone can email or pick up the phone, but when you write a letter, it says that you are very pissed off and ready to take it to the next level which is legal action, getting on TV about that company or person, or you are shining up your AK waiting to start pulling the trigger.  Here it is, just in case yall want to rip it off and use it yourselves, which you shouldn't you little bastards.-get your own shit lol.  &nbsp;   "Mr. Staffieri:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the date of this letter I am still without power to my home. The power went out on Tuesday July 13, 2004 around 9:00 pm. I understand the circumstances causing this, but am quiet confused as to why no one is able to give me a reasonable explanation of why my neighbors and&nbsp;me are without power, yet the surrounding businesses around us all do? Also, why was our power turned on, and then 4 hours later shut right back off? I think these are fair questions to ask and should be met with some sort of intelligent reply. I have received no explanation of anything, except that the crews are working to get the power back up. So far I have seen one truck come out and look at the lines in front of our complex. There has not been much reassurance from your company to make me believe the situation is being handled expeditiously.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the third time in a three-month period a massive amount of customers are losing power for well over 48 hours. I am really at a loss why this keeps happening over and over again? I am sure with the size of LG&amp;E, preventative maintenance is a year round thing and that you all have the people and the equipment to do what is necessary to maintain service. However, with this recent re-occurrence of massive outages, I am starting to question LG&amp;E’s ability to provide service on a normal and continuous basis. My trust in your company has severely waned, if not faltered, due to these recent occurrences. My groceries have spoiled and must be replaced, but I am afraid to go out and buy anything in any great quantity, due to the fact that I could lose service again and be back to square one. I hope you understand my frustration at this point.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As your customer, I am asking to be kept informed with what is going on. I am literally in the dark with not only my power, but also why it is out and what is being done to fix it. I know there are intricacies that don’t need to be gone over, but I think I am intelligent enough to be told that a transformer is out and that the grid will be down until the crewmembers have it replaced and it is working properly again. As a customer you expect me to pay for the services that you render, that is the contract I entered into. However, being that you are the only utility in the area providing gas and electrical services, I don’t feel like you feel any obligation to keep up your end of the contract. If I am late on a payment or refuse to pay you can shut my power off and charge me penalties until I comply. My question is what kind of penalties can I impose on you for an extended loss of service you promised to provide, since I can’t switch companies to penalize you for this error? The situation needs to be rectified and I believe I, and many other citizens of the city, need to be made whole for this massive inconvenience. I would appreciate a response from you regarding this matter. I appreciate your time and wait to hear from you."  &nbsp;  I know pretty long, but I figured that was another punishment I could throw on him.  &nbsp;  12 more days and I am on a plane to sunny Florida-can't wait-it will be Trump Tight.

      Wanna guess what that number is? Well I will tell you. The time yesterday that my power came back on. I was on the phone when I heard a beep, which meant that the fire alarm hooked up to the main power supply was working. It took me 5 minutes getting all of the electronic stuff reset i.e. TV, VCR, Stereos, Clocks. I then ran down to do 2 loads of laundry. After that I ran over to Anthony's and we went out to grab some food. I haven't eaten anything but peanut butter for the last week, so I was in the mood to get something else. We went to Logan's and I got the 9 oz sirloin with a Caesar salad, rolls, and a loaded baked potato. I haven't had a good meal like that in, well over a week. Saw a couple of tough looking SL55 AMG's-I wish I could drop the 120K and buy one. Anyway, we ran into Pat C on the way back to Anthony's and just chilled out there for a while. It's great to be able to see in the morning, have my refrigerator work, and be able to listen to the radio and watch TV. I am in a much better mood today. I have an idea for a team name for Trivia tonight.  &nbsp;  LG&amp;E=Low Grade Efficiency  &nbsp;  How does that one work?

I found it and I can get it for only $15. This has really brightened up my day. I can't wait to get my paws on it, read it, then frame it, and put it on my wall.

      Muthafuckin' LG&amp;E called me at 8 this morning to let me know my power was back on. I said no it wasn't and just hung up the phone before the dude could say anything. I am still seething about this. 105.50 hours without power or 4.4 days. I might snap if this shit isn't back on by the time I get home.  &nbsp;  My apologies to yall who went out last night. I came home from the gym, showered and was reading a book on the couch and passed out.&nbsp;I didn't wake up until 4 this morning. Then I just rolled off the couch and stumbled into the bedroom.  &nbsp;  WTF? God&nbsp;damn it hold on....  &nbsp;  Some stupid old guy was beating on my door. I proceeded to unlock the door and tell him,&nbsp;in a stern manner, that we don't open&nbsp;until 11-fuckhead, hope he dies. I am really on a short fuse. This lack of electricity is making my patience about as thin as a runway model. I am surprised I have ripped into someone yet, besides the LG&amp;E people.  &nbsp;  I am glad almost all of you have your power back on. I know some of you needed it a lot more than I did, so maybe that is why I am waiting. I really don't need it, but it is driving me insane.

      I have been very down on women, as a group lately, because of the women&nbsp;in my life as of late. They are all driving me nuts for different reasons and it is casting a shadow on the female sex. I don't think it is a full moon, the monthly visitor, or God being angry with me, but for whatever reason it is wearing on me mentally. I can't wait until August 3, so I can get on the plane at 7:30 am and hit the beach at noon and leave it all behind for a week.  &nbsp;  Reasons the Ladies are driving me nuts:  &nbsp;   1)  Calling to talk, ask me how I am and what I am up to, then cutting me off and talking about yourself for 45 fucking minutes non stop. I ought to charge per minute if I have to listen that long and can't get a word in edge wise.   2)  Not returning calls, then asking why I don't call anymore. Phone works both ways genius-ask the phone company for a manual on how to operate it. I am busy and don't have time to play Robert DeNiro in Midnight Run.   3)  Going out to where you want to go and then hear you bitch on why we came to (insert location here) Why, why, why, do you do this? If you want to go somewhere and I agree don't act like it's my fault-you wanted to go-blame yourself.   4)  Bitching about the fact that I won't be exclusive with you. I am sorry, I thought I went over this rule when we met. I will know when I am ready to date one and only one woman. Right now that is not happening and if you expect me to change the rules in the middle of the game-you are very wrong and sadly mistaken.   5)  Saying that I don't care and only want one thing. No, that isn't true, I do care. I also want more than one thing. I just may want the different things from someone other than you.   6)  Calling me drunk at 2,3, or 4 in the morning for sex. Before anyone says anything, on a week night when I have to get up at 6 to go to work. Fuck that shit.&nbsp; If you wanted sex cutie, you should have called around 9,10, or even 11, that or call Matt Church-he will put out.   7)  Crying. Unless someone died, is dying, you lost everything you owned, you're going to prison, or something else like that-just stop it. Crying to get me to change my mind doesn't work. It only makes me want to hang up the phone on you that much quicker.   8)  Telling me what to do, like you are God, my mother, my father, my boss, or someone trying to save me from grave danger. I hate that.&nbsp; Stop it, I have told you to stop it before, why do you continue to do that?! Now if you want to pay me an hourly rate like a plumber, electrician, mechanic, etc. Then fine. Going rate is $75 an hour-cash or credit card-no checks-Thank You-Management.   9)  Cursing at me, calling me names, or antagonizing me in other ways. Not only will I hang up the phone on you, I will&nbsp;ask you&nbsp;to leave&nbsp;my place, or we will leave if we are out in public. If you don't leave with me TARC and Yellow Cab provide ways back to where you live.   10)  Bringing up a subject or asking my opinion, then telling me I shouldn't bitch or mind my own business. WTF!! You can't be serious? You asked me for an opinion or brought up a subject, why is it all of the sudden my fault!  &nbsp;  This is all driving me nuts. True, it is my fault for dating, sleeping with, or talking to the women who have done what is written above, but I happen to like women, I just wish yall had stickers on you that read "Damaged" "Dangerous Female" "Sharp Tongued Object Do Not Touch" or something like that. If you are a woman I talk to and I don't pick up the phone, assuming it is a normal hour, then I just maybe taking some time to figure out who I want to still hang out with and who I need to distance myself from.

      Well, I went to bed early last night, early being 10:30, since I had to be at work at 9 am.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I didn't sleep great, due to the fact that I am afraid I will oversleep and be late. You can't be late being a big dog, or Rhino in this case, looks bad. My phone rings. Now I have put in a request that my family call me when I have to work to make sure I am up. Being that I do not have a clock and was half asleep, that is who I figured was calling.  &nbsp;  Me half asleep and sounding like shit "Yeah"  Woman "This is (insert name) with LG&amp;E we were calling to make sure your power is back on"  Me-half asleep and now angry "Hell no it's not on yet! What time is it?"  Woman "You're sure your power is not on"  Me "6:45 on a Saturday?-are you nuts? No I don't have power-it's dark"  Woman "Well we do have crews working in your area to get it back on, we will try back at a later time to check on your status"  Me "Thanks for the wake up call" Slams phone down.  &nbsp;  Not only have these assholes cost me money, but they are calling me on a Saturday morning at quarter till 7? Fucking SOB's WTF?! Who in the hell calls someone that early on a Saturday?? This frigging blows my mind. Stupid muthafuckas. I went back to bed until my real wake up call happened.&nbsp; I am now officially at war with LG&amp;E-you hear me cock suckers it's on. I have now been calling every half hour to report my power out and will continue to do so until I get home tonight.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

If you weren't out with us last night, you missed one of my more crazier performances at the Highland Tap Room. I can pretty much say I had people busting a gut, just ask Church, Graham, or Steve-O. &nbsp; Lata playas

      I have decided to get rid of the anonymous posts. Not because I do not find them amusing or not find out who is doing what. The reason being is that it is taking up time,&nbsp;&nbsp;which I don't feel the need to spend on p.o.s's who don't have the "minimals" , as they say on the other side of the pond, to speak their minds without putting themselves down for others to rebut. I mean, I know who is who, but not everyone else commenting here does, which makes a retort a little more difficult. So from now on say what you want, but you have to say who you are to get up to the podium. &nbsp;  Power is still out on the Preserve and the letters to the two top guys at LG&amp;E have been sent. Fuck 'em. $50 worth groceries down the tubes.  &nbsp;  Went out last night and had a good time. Nice to be out and not thinking about all the shit I will have to do to get my place back in order.  &nbsp;  If my power does come back on,&nbsp; I'll call yall up and have people over, assuming I am not the last one to get my electricity restored.  &nbsp;  Hope everyone has a good weekend.

      You wanted who to really bitch at, I found  urlLink them .  I plan on writing both Vic Staffieri and Ralph Bowling and tell them what a bunch of bullshit it is not having power and losing money on groceries. This is crap and even if I don't get money from them, which I will desperately try to do, I at least will get a response back from one of them.   I don't think we should sit around and take this. I am surprised that some of you are like, oh well not their fault.  BULLSHIT!!  The job of a utility company is not only to provide the service, but to maintain that service and make upgrades when it is necessary. I don't think they have been doing their jobs of that. If you all want to sit around and take it fine, but don't count me in. I will have to spend another $50-70 replacing food I should have been able to eat, not replace. LG&E have not been able to effectively explain why they can't get my power up or when it will be up. There are not trees down around my building, in the streets, or in near by streets. I haven't seen a down wire. All of the surrounding businesses, churches, etc are up-why not me and my neighbor's. I plan on calling LG&E every half hour until they fix it.   Just like Shaq, you don't want to play against me while I am mad.  LG&E-be prepared, I am coming and Hell is coming with me.

      Well, thanks to the fuck ups at LG&E, I had a lot of time to read on my off day. I then came across the article that I said about a month ago I would post on.  2005 Mercedes SLR McLaren  5.5 litre V8 with 626 horsepower and hits sixty in 3.7 seconds. It's a 5 speed auto, because Mercedes' AMG Group has a computer that can shift the transmission into gear quicker than any human possibly could. This car is based on the 60's SLR 300. It is a bad ass looking car that will have everyone looking, of course at $450,000, I don't think anyone I know will be buying one soon. They said the dealership in Beverly Hills is getting one for right now and that there are only a handful coming state side. If I had the cash-that would be my car.

      As far as reading Motley Crue's book "The Dirt" it tore the last part of respect I had for them as people out of my consciousness, like the last strain of a tendon holding on to the bone-gone.  Tommy Lee's family life was kind of like mine, Mom and Dad, syblings, middle class upbringing, etc. However, he himself reminded me of my brother-high energy, big heart, and sometimes being easily swayed or manipulated.  I like Mick, "Fuck the drugs just give me a bottle of booze and my guitar." I dig people that do their own thing and are content on their own and that is Mick.   As for Vince, well, I would have given my left nut to have had some of the women he had. However, I don't think I am even close in relating with him. I was never got the women, never was really extremely popular, or could talk my way out of anything. Vince is a cool guy I wouldn't mind hanging out with him for a while, but his stupidity while drinking would bother me and we would get in a fight.  Nikki is more like my personality, which huffs, because I think Nikki is a self righteous asshole. We were both angry people through out our childhood and through high school. I never really understood why I was mad when I was younger. I do know why I was mad through to college. I was tired of being fat, then when I stopped being fat I was tired of being picked on, then it was my Dad for being cost effective and my Mom for being over protective. I guess I just didn't like the skin I was in. The more I read the book yesterday, the more I realized that I talked a lot of shit, beat up some people who didn't deserve it, was mean as hell for a lot of years, and just plain thought I was the shit and should have listened to the people trying to help me out. Nikki didn't fit in, was more of a nerd than anything, and could never seem to figure women out-I am checking all of these off on my score card as well. Outside of football, having some really kickass friends is all I ever had. I never had the right clothes, car, etc. I have spent my life trying to show people being me was good enough, cool enough, and that if they hung around long enough would know that. I never even came close to the life of Nikki Sixx, or the drugs for that matter, but dealing with the anger and the pain causing it is something only time will help you figure out and fix-that's where we kind of met, dealing with that and getting past it-moving forward. I hate the fact that I am closer to him in personality than the other guys, because Nikki has said and done some stuff I really don't get. There have been times throughout the years I wanted to just beat the shit out of him and leave him in a heap. He's a royal asshole and a fuck up. If we ever meet somewhere other than the concerts I attended, I think we would just size each other up and walk off. I think I would rather just go drink at a bar with Mick and have him teach me how to play guitar. Oh well, could be worse, could be someone from Warrant or Winger.  I guess when you are a kid, you think your favorite band, as people, are as cool as their music. When you are a teenager, some of the bad shit they do make them cool and the music more real, when you get to be an adult you're skeptical and realize that there is a difference between the people and the music. They guys that made up the band you thought was awesome are really unintelligent, pathetic, junkie crybabies who don't know what to do with the money, women, etc. I still think their music rocks, but the book only confirmed what I had known for the last 7 or 8 years, they as people didn't. I guess that is what made the music good. I still think they have another Dr. Feelgood in them, the question is whether they can get together and do it. Hope so-just for one last time.

       Friday night -I left work with my brother and his friend Billy to go grab my ride. I get my car, throw in Motorhead and off we go to get the hell of off Dixie Highway before it got dark on a Friday night. My brother said that while we were waiting at a light he had to turn up his radio, because he could hear "Overkill" way too loud. Billy said the bass/drums combo in that song made it sound like thunder or light artillery. That made me happy. I thought my brother was going to stop by later, but he didn't. I wasn't really shocked by that, I didn't think he would, but I stayed up till Midnight just in case.   Saturday -I woke up around 7 am, I don't know why, I just did. When I looked at the clock, the only thing that entered my head was GNR's "Mr. Brownstone". I got up and trudged over to the bathroom to clean up before heading to the gym. I ended up getting to the gym around 9 and did some cardio and weights for about and hour and a half. I ran over to Borders, because I had a coupon and I wanted to get the book. The book in question is Motley Crue's "The Dirt". After I left there I went to Hallmark to pick up some cards, especially one for wedding. I can't speak enough on how proud I am of Will and Beth. Both of them are very nice and genuine people. I am very luck to have such a good friend like Will. Beth makes them very happy and I am sure they will be 110 walking around town holding hands. It's a very good thing. It did take me a while to pick a card for them. I always like to give something that is sincere, heart felt, etc. It's hard to find a card that isn't too sappy or too religious. I hope they liked what I picked. I always get nervous about that kind of stuff. I stopped by my house and then my Dad called right in the middle of me writing the note on the card. He said something about me stopping by because he needed me to sign some papers. I told him I would do it on Sunday and then ended the conversation. I called back 3 minutes later and said I would be over to sign them. I knew it would only take 5 minutes to get down to my parents house, 5 or 10 minutes there, and then back to my pad to get ready for the wedding. I came back home and cleaned up. I did such a good job shaving my face it was more smooth that a strippers thigh covered in baby oil. Ate some lunch, got dressed, made some phone calls, and then rolled on over to the Church. I got there and Church, Graham, Jay, and Steve-O were all out front. The weather was hot and muggy, but for some reason it still seemed cooler than earlier. Eventually, we went inside, talked to Waggs, Dominic, and The Baron, who were all groomsmen. The Baron walked us to a pew, it reminded me of Columbus finding the Dominican Republic, because he wasn't sure where he was going and we all questioned where the hell he dropped us at. We sat there talking smack back and forth and Graham couldn't believe how rude, crude, and socially unacceptable we were being in a Church. I think he thought the altar would split due to the groups unholy behavior. Eventually, Doug, Christine, Beck, Pat, Tipton, and Bill all showed up. I bit my tongue, because I knew I would get in trouble at some of the comments I was ready to dish out. Church was throwing zingers left and right and everyone to the right of Graham was following suit. The wedding was great, the Priest looked like Principal Skinner's and Willie the Groundskeeper's love child. The reception brought more craziness from Steve-O saying the keyboard player looked like Janet Reno, to everyone thinking me and Red Sonja were doing a drug deal in the parking lot, to The Baron dancing like a nut. The band was awesome and Christine wanted to dance at every song and I got punched when I politely declined. We all eventually made plans for Shenanigan's at 7:30 and said our goodbyes to the Bride and Groom. On the way home we got a downpour that looked like it was Monsoon season in Bangladesh. I got home, loaded the free pop ice into the freezer, checked my mail, and got out of my wet suit.   Saturday Night -I picked up Graham and then went over and picked up Steve-O and Church. Rolled over to Shenanigan's around 8 or so and we all took over 3 tables outside. It was like a gang 14 or 16 people sitting around. Everyone was drinking, having fun, telling stories, and the good times kept rolling from the reception. Then, a Land Rover pulled up and 4 hotties rolled out. 3 of which were blonde Amazonian Godesses. I think every guy there-single or not, looked over at the eye candy after my jaw dropped. Two words came to mind "Yum..Me" Anyway, the drinking continued, the stories kept rolling, and then it started getting dark, and that is when the mood shifted. I don't know if everyone was tired or had to much to drink, but I could tell on people's faces that they weren't having a good time. Comments went from people kidding around, to some rougher remarks. We then moved part of the party over to The Back Door. Church and I ran our sober team against everyone and one. I did enjoy beating the guy that thought he was a pimp. He seemed cool, but he was very cocky after beating a very drunk Graham and Steve-O. Good player, but Church and his 5 man fury, couldn't be stopped. I blocked a couple of decent shots by the guy and that's what did it. I think we beat him 2 or 3 times and then I just wanted to sit down. I was starting to slow down and I was dying for a drink, but I couldn't, I made a deal with myself that come August 1st, it's on again, and I would stick to it. After that Church, Graham, Steve-O, and myself went over to the Tap Room. I was really tired at this point, and don't know if it was that, the sobriety, women issues or what, but I just sat down and kinda zoned out. Eventually, Steve-O lost his fight with gravity. I got a phone call late from a chick I haven't talked to in a couple of weeks that night and she was drunk. I should have just let the phone ring, but I didn't. I knew what she wanted, but I just didn't feel like going over to her place. I eventually said she was breaking up and I hung up the phone. She called back 10 minutes later and I just told her that I was busy and that I had to go. I eventually took Church home and then went home and crashed after that.   Sunday -I finally woke up and got out of bed around noon and started reading "The Dirt". Jennifer called me around 1..2? I can't remember and wanted to talk and see about coming over. I was tired still and didn't feel like getting cleaned up so she could come over talk about her problems and leave 45 minutes later after having a few drinks and maybe some oral. She sounded disappointed, but sobriety is driving me nuts and I just needed some time to chill yesterday and not really deal with any people. I told her we would pick another day for her to come over and hang out. I kept reading the book, breaking to watch a movie or eat some pizza. I eventually looked up at the clock when my phone buzzed at me-it was 10. I could believe that I had been reading this book for that long. I looked at the caller ID-again, I should have left it alone.   Her "Hey" Me "Sup" Her "I wanted to call and talk to someone that could make me laugh"  That right there told me that she just wanted to talk, because something crazy was going on and she knew I was stupid enough to listen to her babble. I told her a joke and made her laugh a little. She pisses me off and I really don't like her a bit, but something tugged at me and told me to listen, because she sounded different this time. I don't know if it was her tone, inflection, or timing of her call, but I just put my book down, sat on the couch and did a half-ass listening job. We talked for maybe 20 minutes and then I got back to reading my book. By the time I was finished reading it was 1:30 and I remembered I forgot to call Ursula. I felt bad because she is a friend, a woman that I really respect and can have good conversations and good laughs with. I know she won't be too upset when I call tonight, but some how I think it disappoints her and makes her sad when I forget. Right now I remembered I didn't call Heather C and go to the movies yesterday. She never called, so she probably forgot as well. I am sure I will hear her bitch though next time I see her. Kelly left me a text message late last night and it made me feel warm and fuzzy when I came in this morning.   Re-Edit -After reading the ups and downs of Motley Crue, I realized the little drama we all were in and some of the similarities:  1)That even through fights, women, booze, drugs, etc. Most of us are still good friends and would go to the mat for each other.  2)Women are crazy. Rich, beautiful women are even crazier, will take everything you have, and sick the cops and the legal system on you. 3)Sobriety, makes you take a different look at your friends, yourself, and stuff going on at bars. To quote Ozzy, "Sobriety Sucks!" 4)We all say things, that at the time we think are funny and taken as a joke. In actuality, the person we said it about is pissed, keeps quiet, and broods about it. 5)Just because your friend is making money, don't assume he's piling it up. If you aren't his accountant-you don't know what's coming in and what's going out. 6)Family and friends are that damn important. It's good to have someone that will tell you you're wrong or say no, when everyone else is kissing your ass. 7)Things happen for wired reasons and at wired times. You won't know why, but it is usually for the best. For example at Will's wedding there was a discussion about Spiderman 2. Then we talked about the movies that the actor who plays Doc Oc has been in. Well Bill said a line from "Raiders of The Lost Ark" I remembered him being in it. Yesterday, guess what the first thing on when I turned on the TV was? Right, "Raiders of The Lost Ark"  I had a good time, could have been better, but I got to see, hear, and read some pretty good shit this weekend. Congrats again to Will and Beth. Motley Crue's book "The Dirt" is a good read. I am getting Lemmy's book next. I am off for 2 days, so see yall Thursday.

      Well, got out  my aggression last night by working out, cleaning my place up, and chowing down on burgers. I was very relaxed at that point until I was on the phone with Kelly watching "Bullshit" which is hosted by Penn and Teller. They covered PETA and I will reserve another post for that rant.  This morning the dealership is fixing the window for free, due to warranty. The only problem is that they have to replace the window. I was bummed about it, but at least it will all be fixed today. I got a shuttle ride from the dealership to work. I go talk to my boss about some stuff, when one of our customers, who does tinting and auto detailing/accessories, comes in. I ask him for a price and he said he would redo the 2 windows for $30. I was stoked, so next Wednesday I will be getting that done.   As for the women stuff, nuts to it, I don't give a shit. I have better things to do then deal with a bunch of crap.   Raul's wedding is tomorrow and that should be a great time. I hope to see some of you there.

      Ladies listen up.   If you want something from a guy-ask him straight up, don't give us signs, hint at it, use suggestive language, just spit it out. If it is something we don't mind we will say yes, if we don't like it we will say no. Women wonder why men are not happy and well adjusted, it is due to you all and your lack of being straight forward.

      Getting out of bed this morning wasn't easy, I was still tired, I don't think I have had one day in the last 3 weeks, where I didn't have something going on in the morning. I go out to go to work, put my stuff in my car and start it up. Everything is 100% so far. I then go to roll my window down and I hear a click. I look over in the direction of said click and there is my window, off the fucking track. So I go to roll it back up, figuring it is something minor and I will be able to get it back on. Nope, I hear something fall down into the door. I clench my teeth and feel my jaw get real solid. I get the window back in place where it isn't moving and isn't out of place. I get back in the car and drive to work screaming obscenities the whole way.   I had an 8 am meeting for my region. I am coming out of the meeting, I am sure looking unhappy, and some new chick goes "Smile, it's a great day"  Here's what I wanted to say while leaning about an inch from her face "FUCK OFF YOU STUPID BITCH AND LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!!!"  Here's what I really said "Nice opinion."  I hate having things broken and having to wait to get them fixed. If something is wrong I like to fix it then and there, I am very impatient when it comes to that stuff and it puts me in a bad mood until it is corrected. Hopefully, the dealership will have it taken care of tomorrow. The only problem is I will have to be at the dealership at 8 and then work until 8-fucking a this ain't right.

      Well, I thought about this one. I know there is a certain amount of curiosity among you all as to the little road trip I did this weekend. I have decided to give you all some information without going into great details. I will say it was a very slow, sensual, relaxing experience. We took our time with everything and that made it very enjoyable. I would say we spent a good two hours before we even got to sex. The first hour we just kissed, talked, caressed and massaged each other. The next hour yall can figure out what came next. After that, well, I am not going into vast detail, but the sex was slow, rhythmic, and passionate. I think the morning version was more fun, of course I always think the morning version is that way.   I think she is a very sexy and sexual woman, who is also very sweet. We had a good time and probably will again.   There are some things if you email and ask me, I will tell you, although I am reserving the right to keep what is mine, well, mine. I am expecting some fodder, but that's what happens when you lay stuff out to people. Now, you who are my friends, I did this post for you all, because I have always been pretty honest and forthcoming-sometimes regardless if you wanted to know or not. The dynamics of our relationship merit me telling yall some of this. To the rest of you, sorry it's not as steamy and as detailed as you had hoped.

      Has anyone seen the VH1 Behind the Music on Guns and Roses? I think it is pretty half ass compared with some of the other ones they did. I mean, they didn't even get a current interview with Duff? I know Axl aka Bill Bailey is a prick, but no one could get him to talk? I am also not impressed with the dirt they showed. Pretty f-ing weak if you ask me. VH1 I give you a C minus on that one.

      Well, Monday, I met my Dad around noon to take the boat out and grab some lunch. We launched into the river and headed towards Downtown. My Dad told me to take the controls on the top side, so that we could enjoy the weather rather than sit in the cabin. The weather was awesome, plenty of sun and there was a nice wind coming in from the South West. We stopped by Jimmy's and got some lunch. The whole time we just talked about regular stuff, no business or anything crazy. Just regular father/son stuff. I think that was part of the best part, because me and my Dad really have never done a lot of just regular conversation. We docked the boat just before a huge thunderstorm hit. Very heavy winds and torrential downpour. Graham is on the money when he says that area of town got hit hard. I stopped by my parents house to see my mom and see how she was. We talked for a while and I picked up some mail, that for some strange reason keeps coming there instead of to my place. Circuit City sent me a $25 gift card, which I promptly used to pick up two movies "Swingers" and "The Man Who Knew Too Little" both movies are awesome and the latter one is probably Bill Murray's funniest movie. Trivia was great due to team names and the fact that we got in the money for the first time in 2 weeks. Nice way to end a day.  Tuesday was a long day. The plumber stopped by to check out my bathroom sink and see what the deal was with the clogs and check out my water heater. The sink was no big deal and only cost me a C note. The big pain in the ass was the water heater. We went down to the basement to check on the PTV Valve and see what was up. Bad news came soon in the form of the whole thing had to be replaced. The bottom was rusting out. He said he would have to come back later in the afternoon and it would cost around 5 C notes. I wasn't too thrilled, but my parents have been using him for years and the guy is reliable, efficient, and honest, so I agreed. The main thing was having the afternoon tied up. I took the time and went and got my oil changed, since the trip to Cincy added a couple hundred miles to it. He came back around 3:30, changed out the water heaters and boom, by 5 or so he was out the door. I proceeded to fix a couple of burgers for dinner and watch some ESPN.   Raul's wedding is this weekend, which should be very fun. I can't wait to see what occurs at the reception.  I can't believe Anthony has a site! I mean I am not online for 2 days and this is what happens. WTF Anth!? I thought you would never have a blog site. I guess Hell has frozen over.  As for Sunday night/Monday morning in Cincy, well, I am still mulling over how to write about that experience. I will post something, so everyone relax. I will say that it was great and that the whole thing was very cool.

      Well yesterday at work was bullshit. We didn't do anything after lunch around 12:30, provided by those wonderful people at KFC. Yeah, I know some of yall out there don't like them, but their food is great, so if you want to help them make great tasting food without death to chickens, well go for it. I on the other hand will be dipping the chicken strips in the left over gravy from the mashed potatoes while eating a biscuit.  I got off work and went to the gym, I was surprised that I was able to do the same weights and reps with no problem, considering it had been a week since I had been there. I was there maybe 45 minutes and went home-broke a sweat, but didn't kill myself. Cleaned up and went grocery shopping since I was pretty much out of food. Took me 10 minutes to get in and out of the store and I think I am stacked up with food for a month or so for only $50-not too shabby. Finished up my laundry from early in the day. I know, aren't I the domesticated one, but it had to get done and I was the only one to do it. Chilled out for a half hour after that watching some TV and then Em called.  Em works with me at the bank and she had told me earlier in the week that she wanted me to hang out with her and her friends up at a bar where one of their friends bands was playing. Honestly, I didn't think she would call, women are terrible for remembering to call, but she proved me wrong. Em is about 5'6, blonde curly hair, great body, and I love the perfume she wears. Anyway, the band was "Who's Hundley" and they do covers. They're not the greatest, but the way they had the crowd going last night, you would have thought so. Everyone had a great time and the songs were good. I liked this band, because they would let their friends come up and sing songs with them. This one big dude, I mean about 6'5 300?, looked like an ex-ball player came up and sang "Give Me Two Steps" by Skynard. It was the good vibe they had that made them a fun band to watch play live. I talked to Em a bit, but she was drunk when I got there and hammered by the time I left. Her friends were cool, but they were there with their husbands or boyfriends, so I really was the odd man out. I left around 1 or so, the band was done and I really didn't feel like hanging around to chill out with that group. Em gave me a hug before I left, which was nice, but I felt like I was a freshman in high school leaving a mixer when I left that bar. I didn't really know too many people, watched others have a good time, and left without a chick. I guess I was looking for more of an opportunity to talk to her and I thought there would be more people I knew at the bar. Don't get me wrong, I talked to the people I was with and it was alright, but still it left me with an awkward feeling.  Everyone else wasn't doing shit, so I drove around for a bit before going home. You know how sometimes everyone else wants to call it a night and you just don't feel it. The air felt good and I wanted to just relax and take the car around the block or two for a bit before going home. It was nice to have the windows down and just hear the car's engine and the other night sounds. Very relaxing. A good drive always winds me down.  Today I am leaving for Cincy after work. I know this is providing major fodder for my friends. I often wonder why I tell people stuff like that, I mean, I have friends that don't say dime one about when they fuck, who they fuck, or how they fuck. However, I am the Mouth of the South-Jimmy Hart ain't got shit on me, and I feel like my friends deserve a little better than a bland response of what I am doing. Most of the time I try to play down anything I am doing with a woman and any insinuations about what we are doing. I am still not sure if I will go into any details about tonight. It's funny how half of my friends want the dirt and the other half cringe in a way like hearing about your parents sex life if I try to dish them anything. I figure I will try to walk the wire yall put up for me.   This should be a lot of fun and a nice way to relax for the holiday weekend. I'll be back in town tomorrow, because I have a lunch appointment with my Dad. I think he wants to show me his new boat, so if the weather and the river are right, I guess we'll go out for that. Always seems like business when I get together with Popps. Tomorrow night is trivia and I will be back in full force-so no excuses for not being in the money this week mutha fuccas.

      The man that made the role is dead at 80. Marlon Brando, in my opinion was a great actor with a very long and great career. From "On the Waterfront" to "Godfather" to "Apocolyse Now" to "The Score" he was a favorite of mine. He did some odd ball films, but he was just being himself. The guy was a walking soap opera with his son killing his daughter's boyfriend or something, his weight, the maid having his kids, etc. Good actor though and I know he will be missed.

      Well, my morning did not start off great. My bathroom sink is backed up. I put some drain cleaner in it, but I am not sure if that will work or not, so I am going to see if I can get a plumber to come out to the crib next Tuesday, my only day off next week to get errands done. So, sorry to say, but let's hold off using my place until the sink is working.  There have been two good points this morning so far.  1) The Yankees beat the Red Sox last night 5 to 4 in the bottom of the 14,or 15. The highlights were great. Jeter made a crazy catch and dove headfirst into the 3rd base seats after making the catch. I know all you Red Sox fans are sick with the way the season is ending up, considering it started out great.   2) I saw 2 very sweet cars on I-64 on my way to work, both of which I believe are brand new, a BMW M5 coupe and an E55 Mercedes AMG sedan. The Mercedes was hauling ass, by that I mean, doing at least 90 mph. The BMW wasn't even gonna try to mess with him. The funny this was seeing some Sk8tr/GDog/Eminem dumbass in a VW Passat get on the E55's bumper. What happened next got me laughing my ass off. The fast lane cleared and the E55 was gone-I mean gone. Dipshit in the VW didn't realize he was messing with one of the fastest sedans on the planet and got to eat shit trying to keep up. I took the opportunity to pass the VW, roll down my window, and scream "You got knocked the Fuck out maannn!!". I know he/she/it couldn't hear me with their windows up, but I had to say it. That's like me trying to do that with mine. I love my car to death, but a driver has to know his car's limitations.  I have never seen an E55 before, but it had a very nice design. The BMW looked more sporty, but the Mercedes is a sleeper-you'd never see it coming-and could probably seat 5 comfortably. I would love to see the interior, hell I would love to drive one. I felt like I worked for Car and Driver watching the 2 cars move down the interstate it was very Trump Tight.  After today only 2 more days and everything is back to normal at work no more 10 or 12 hour days and no working 7 days in a row. Everyone have a good 4th and try not to blow yourself up in the process.

      I work this weekend, but I am off on Monday.  My theory is to have a big party on Saturday with the Tropical Shirt Theme. Friday I say putt-putt at The Beer Depot. We can start at my place and go from there. Sunday, well, we can use some Wolf-Pack smoke bombs and go crazy.  Someone send out some emails and let's get the Party started.

      Yeah, I know, the Game Preserve looks different. Well, we got some government funding and put up some new huts and some extra strength fencing to keep the animals in.  I am pretty sure I got everyone's address listed over to the right. If I had you up before and you don't see yourself on there now, please let me know and I will fix that. I know there is one person who is not on there, but I should be able to correct that by the end of the weekend.  Also, I don't know why some stuff looks highlighted and other stuff doesn't. Email me if you want to go on a technical rant, leave the posts alone.  I like the new format a little better. I assure yall that I will keep trying to upgrade the site.

      I called Ms. Cincy last night, conversation is going well, and about 10 or 15 minutes into the conversation this is what happens:   Me, "When am I coming up there, Saturday or Sunday?"   Then a pause. Now ladies, I know what happens when you all pause, it means no, or whatever I just said was wrong, you're angry at me, etc. So before she can get a word out, I start to go into my speech about why I can't come up and have some "adult" fun with her. I will not go into her responses she gave, because they are weak and basically it makes me pissed off. You see, both my parents are excellent in the skill of debate, hell it's part of their jobs. Growing up, I had to be quick with responses, and valid ones at that, or else I wasn't going to do what I was asking to do or asking for.   After batting down her excuses, I mean responses, I start to quit in the debate, discussion, whatever, and I get quiet, because I am thinking this is bullshit-she's the one that asked me up and how she wanted to get together.  Hearing the silence she flippantly says, "Well come up next weekend"  That did it. Not only is one of my best friends getting married next weekend to a sweetheart of a woman, I didn't appreciate the tone and inflection with which she said it, so I say, "Are you out of your mind, my friend is getting married next weekend, I have told you that before."  Her, "Well come up after it's over" Me, "I don't know when that's gonna be, besides, you said you wanted to get together this weekend-am I wrong on that?" Her, "No, I did, but.." Me cutting her off, "Then we're not getting together this weekend and we'll have to figure something out for August" Her, "You're mad aren't you? You know how I feel and I do want to get together, I just forgot about it being the 4th this weekend. If you wanted to, you could find time before August."  Let me pause the conversation here for a second, if yall don't mind. Let me go over her errors in what she said.  1) Am I mad? Damn right I am, I am horny as hell, and was lead to believe I was going to have some hot, wild, wet sex this weekend and now I am getting cockblocked by the pussy itself. 2) How in the @$#! do you not know it's the 4th of July?! I mean Jesus Christ, it isn't like Memorial Day or Labor Day where you don't know the date.  IT'S THE FUCKING 4TH DAY OF JULY EVERY YEAR!!  3) Let's see, the only weekend I have off until August is the weekend Raul is getting married. I do have Sunday off, so I am being a brat in that respect, I could drive up there that day, so I have defeated myself on that point-glad she didn't bring that up. However, I am not driving up there on a Saturday night, when I have to work the next Sunday. I even admit now that I really can only go off about 2 points, the third one makes me look like a 4 year old throwing a temper tantrum.  Don't ever insult my intellignce-please. Make fun of my looks, my car, my house, my clothes, etc. This is one way to make me angry very fast.  Conversation on  Me, "You know my schedule is crazy and you want me to drive up there. If you really want to you can drive down here during a weekend I work." Her, "I could...I don't know"  This is the part where she continues to talk, while I sit there and watch the Yankees game pretty much hearing her talk, but not paying a lick of attention. Eventually, I say I am tired and I need to go to bed. She throws the-sure you're not mad and let's talk tomorrow I'll work something out phrase in. I appreciate it, but the mood is ruined. It's not like I only planned on doing this once, I figured I could make a couple of weekend trips up to Cincy to get together. Now my interest is down and I am mulling over what to do. I know she is in the pilot's seat, as far as me coming up, but I am not going to just follow her directions.  I had to vent. The week has been long enough and chocked full 'o shit to be dealing with a potential lay giving me crap.

      Boring day. I feel very uncreative. My shoulders are almost 100% back to normal from the sunburn. Hey Rhinos get burned as well. My place looks like dog shit-laundry, mail, and other shit all over the place. I did get my bonus from last quarter-that's all going towards paying on what I spent last week lol. *In a Rick James voice* "I ran a hell of a bar tab"  I am getting some road trips in September. So the Rhino maybe coming to a town near you. World Tour 2004 baby.

      I don't know why I am posting. I don't really have anything interesting to say, at least from my perspective.  I do know I am making headway getting all of the lost numbers reprogrammed into my phone. I am missing maybe a fourth of what I had before, but it is decreasing everyday. I do appreciate everyone getting me their info. I was lucky enough to have most of what I would consider important numbers back in my phone within 5 days. Once I get all of the numbers back in, I will have to go back to do the voice recognition thing.  Well, anyone doing anything this weekend? I am up for something Saturday night. Keep me posted.

      This maybe old stuff for yall, but I figured I would post it anyway.  Last Friday Rick James died, which means no more Chappelle skits. Rumor is he OD'd on Coke on tour with Tina Marie. Speaking of Dave, he got a huge deal with Comedy Central on doing more seasons of Chappelle Show. I didn't see the figures, but I heard he cleaned up.  Locally, a big drug dealer got busted by the feds while getting coke from 2 Hispanic guys from Columbus OH. I heard the Feds landed a couple hundred thousand in cash, guns, and a good number of keys of cocaine. Looks like an airtight case because of the surveillance video. When will people learn not to do stuff like this in public and this guy was big time?-jeez.

      Whew, what a trip. I am both happy and not so happy to be back home in the game preserve. I am still very tired, going through alcohol withdrawal, and nursing a very bad sun burn on my right shoulder i.e. blisters.  Let me start things off right-at least date wise.  Sunday August 1- urlLink Graham ,  urlLink Waggs , Steve-O,  urlLink Christine , and myself drank and laughed at G I Joe Season 1 Part 2. Basically, I got drunk drinking half bottle or 3 quarters of a bottle of Makers.  Monday August 2-Got up and started packing to get ready for my trip. The guys came around 1:30 to put the new dishwasher in. Finished up packing and had a glass of vodka to help with my hang over.  Tuesday August 3-The earliest I remember ever getting up 5:45. Double checked what I packed, had my brother pick me up, grabbed one of my buddies and flew down with another frat buddy to Ft Lauderdale. We got to the hotel around 1:30, checked in, did some Jaeger shots, and walked down A1A to grab some grub. Everyone was in t shirt and shorts, except for me torn jeans, boots, and a t-shirt. We found a nice Italian place with a great view of the beach with Calzones as big as your head-well not that big, but very big. Then "To The Beach!" I was in heaven. The water was very warm, sand was soft and I got to see some Manta Rays swimming around with me 40 yards off shore. Very cool. Eventually went back to the hotel and met up with some friends of mine who just came in and were at the bar at the pool. Couple shots of Jack later shooting Jaeger in a suite and just chilling out. Around 11 or so, I got bored and went to the room to just watch some TV and relax.  Wednesday August 4-Lunch, Volleyball for 3 hours-I kick ass by the way-Mike Blackstock better learn not to spike it against a well timed vert by the Rhino. After that we went back to the hotel and cleaned up before hitting some Irish bar by the hotel. The manager of the bar told of of my buddy's that the 30 of us made his month-I guess we ran some good tabs. After some pool and a shit load of drinking we went to Howlin' at the Moons and sang along with the cute Piano ladies who played anything I asked for, which were only 3 songs "You don't even call me by my name" by David Allan Coe, "Piano Man" by Billy Joel, and "Home Sweet Home" by Motley Crue. Apparently, I grabbed a fishbowl drink off of a table full of sorority girls, before sitting on stage and singing with the piano ladies. I guess they didn't mind me nabbing the booze. I then left there, back to the hotel, and to the beach to go swimming at 3 am-that was awesome by the way.  Thursday August 5-Beach, beach, beach, that's all I did that day was Beach. Got invited to dinner at Piasano's that some of my friends from STL were going to. Everyone else went to Jaxson's. A limo picked us up and took us to dinner in Southbeach. I really went because Mark's sister and Pam were going-how can I turn down dinner with 2 cuties like that. Nice restaurant and a fun time, but fuck the itty bitty $9 glass of Vodka on the Rocks. My phone literally died that morning. I appreciate my friend Javi driving me to Cingular to get it fixed, but they couldn't, all they could do is overnight me a new one. The best part was losing all of my numbers, so apologies to  urlLink Murphy  for not calling about being in the area. We hit a bar called the Clevelander, which was cool and had a few drinks. After that, back to the limo for a ride back. Went to Quarterdeckers in Ft Lauderdale and had a huge party. There were about 50 of us there drinking like fiends. I got a really good buzz on, but not stupid drunk. I got some really good pictures with some lovely ladies. We ran the bar out following beer that night:Budweiser, Bud Light, Miller Light, Michelobe, and Michelobe Light. The bar only had a half bottle of Jaeger left, 4 cases of Coors Light, a bottle and a half of vodka, and one bottle of rum. The waitress said she had never seen them this busy, but that we were all nice, good tippers, and probably made the bar's quarter. I know of 4 tabs in the triple digits. Left the bar and went swimming in the ocean with a few of my buddies and a few of the ladies. Eventually we went back to the hotel pool, while I went to the hot tub. Security showed up and kicked everyone out and eventually found me in the hot tub with a nice lady, luckily, not in a compromising position and said we had to leave. Eventually everyone hit there rooms and I think I was in bed by 5 or 6.  Friday August 6-Lunch at Cafe Del Mar? I think that was it with Becca and Pam then to the beach for some swimming, lewd comments, and then some beach football. After that a casino cruise, which had terrible lounge singers and I dropped $40 way to quick. Walked around the ship and just chilled until we got back from the hotel. I didn't go out, because I was dumb and got my shoulders burnt. They hurt like a mother so I just watched ESPN and their coverage of the NFL and went to bed.  Saturday August 7-Weather was crappy stayed at the hotel, had dinner, and then to Howlin' at the Moon for drinks and some fun. Too crowded, so I went down to the beach for a half hour to relax and then headed back up there. Stayed there for a while and then went back to the hotel at 3 to get up at 6 to get to the Airport and on our flight home.  Sunday August 8-Flight out at 8:10 in Louisville at 12:15, back on the road at 3 or so. Some really good sex at 6:00. I think we eventually got out and grabbed some dinner at 8? I dunno  Monday August 9-Early morning sex, nap, morning sex, nap, noon sex, nap. Back home around 7:30. Started laundry, cleaning up pad, going through mail, watching Football, and eventually going to sleep.  Tuesday August 10-210 emails when I came in at 7:30 feeling tired, alcohol withdrawal, and having my shoulder still sore(hopefully that will heal from the second degree burn by Friday)  Any donations from my crazy spending can be sent to me. God knows I need it after spending that kind of cash.

      Ah vacationing on the sunny warm beaches of Ft Lauderdale aka Lauddy Dauddy and Miami are that much closer. I am sure the folks down there don't want to see my white ass, but I will tan or burn quickly.  Yesterday was pretty good. Decent work out at the gym, then over to Circuit City to by some DVD's(all of which I got great deals on), then to the liquor store to get my ammo for next week(a bottle of Skyy and a bottle of Jager), then home to unpack and shower. Grabbed some grub and watched "Carlito's Way". Jay and Graham called and hatched up a plan to go to the Tap Room and hang out. Me and Church vs Steve-O and Graham in foos. Matt and I usually lost, but I got in good shots and played good D three quarters of the time. Even Graham gave me some props for stone walling him a couple of times. For those of you that don't know, Graham is pretty good at foos, so when he says you do alright, then you are doing alright. Jen came up and hung out for a bit. It struck midnight and Graham said that since my no drinking was officially over that I should have a drink. I said I didn't need to, but under the duress of peer pressure, I relented and had a shot of Jager/Rumplemintz. We all then decided to move to Wet Willies, or so I thought. I dropped Jen off at her place and then drove by the movie site. Yes, they are doing 2 movies here right now. One is directed by Cameron Crowe and I am not sure about the other one. Went down to Wet Willies and hung out with Jay and Allie. For those in the crew here in town, Joe Cormney is a bartender there. I don't think he remembers anyone, which is good, because I don't feel like talking to him. The scene was very yuppie, GAP, aka Eurotrash. Wasn't jam packed, but there was a good number of people there. I was bored, wasn't my scene, and just was glad when we left. The cops nodded at me when we left the joint. I will say I get less flack from law enforcement when I have a fresh cut. Home and in bed by 3 am  People are welcome over to the crib tonight around 5 to hang out and have a few drinks.  I will be on vacation come Monday and will not be posting or anything via a computer until August 10. I hope everyone has a great week and I will talk to yall when I get home.
