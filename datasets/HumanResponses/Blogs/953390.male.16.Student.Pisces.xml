      Seriously, have a good Memorial Day... though I wish FedEx would run today for obvious reasons. Oh, I have a case of the hives. It's so retarded. I went to see my doctor about it because I had no idea what these big-ass 'bug-bites' were, but they were freakin' huge! Looked like plateaus on my arms and knees. So, he said that they were hives, but not because of allergies (I was about to say... I had a test and I have no allergies, but I swear I have one to grits!). It was due to 'an indirect reaction to a virus.' Tyler, my little brother, had a tummy bug, so instead of getting sick, my body is fighting it and getting these stupid, itching-like-buggers, plateaus. So, for next 4-5 days, I have to wear loose clothing, pop Benadryl like a crack fiend, and hang around 'till they disappear. Yay for me! :-/ I gave someone my web address and they asked me if it were some gay porn website. That about killed me from laughter. :-D

      OK, I must profess my undying love for the band  Scissor Sisters.  They must be musical perfection, because there is no better that I can think of within 2 minutes. ;-P I just got the UK version of their self-titled album, which must be the only thing even resembling something close to boring (that is, the title). I especially love 'It Can't Come Quickly Enough.'  THAT  is the textbook example of perfect song. I don't think I've heard male vocals achieve as much as that on electronica.   GO JAKE SHEARS!!!   I really don't want to sound like a fanatic but... if you ever read this, please  urlLink email me here.  Or IM me @ sockeatingdryer (AIM)

      Today has been such a  boooorrrrriiiinnnnngggg  day. It doesn't really feel like summer; more like a weekend. I keep expecting to have to go to school tomorrow. I'm ready to   go somewhere!   Of course, I will be the week after next. Mum got reservations at  urlLink Largo Mar,  this little slightly upscale place in PC Beach we go to for all next week. She even said I could take a friend! I think I know who. My little brother can't, though. Too bad. :-( I checked my email this morn and... lo and behold, I got an email from Apple saying that my eMac shipped yesterday. Hooray! Welp, I think I'll go back to groovin' out to  urlLink 'Whenever You Feel Like It'  by Kylie Minogue. LOL

      Hoo, boy, am I excited! I ordered my new eMac from the online Apple Store yesterday morning! I can't wait to get it! If you are interested in purchasing my iMac from me or swapping it for a 2nd or 3rd generation iPod, please email me  urlLink here  or if you are using Hotmail/Gmail/Yahoo, send one to sockeatingdryer[at]gmail[dot]com. Thanks so much! I also would like to say Happy Birthday to one of my favourite sirens, Kylie Minogue! I want to just snog with you!

      Well, I went on an adventure with my mother this morning/early afternoon. The adventure? Going to get groceries and Chinese for lunch. I had to get some supplies for my AP summerwork (see -- 'a lot'), and I got 3 binders, 3 notebooks, 3 sets of dividers, and a set of slash pockets for my reports and PowerPoint CDs. Oh, and 2 of those  urlLink Pilot Pens that I love.  I also had a little stalker while I was there. While Mum went to go get groceries, I did my own little trip for my AP stuff. There was this guy who walked up in the binder/presentation sets aisle (at WalMart) and appeared to be looking for something; I had seen him earlier in the cat care aisle. I thought nothing of it, found the  urlLink binders I needed,  and left for the pens/pencils aisle. While I was there, he popped up in the paper/filing aisle. Looking at the paper and glancing at me. I still thought nothing of it and walked over to there to pick up some 90-Brightness Ink Jet paper (I like brighter paper -- the brighter, whiter; the better). I left then for the grocer's section to go to my mum. Then I noticed he was walking in the same direction as I. I then took notice and thought it a coincidence. Later I had to pick up some rock salt, so I went to do that, but I didn't know exactly where it was, other than near the fabrics aisle. So, I wondered around the (what I thought to be) the fabrics aisle, looking for the home-made ice-cream supplies. I saw him a few times, and was beginning to get really freaked out. I finally turned around one corner to find his face on the other side of the aisle, peering over the corner right beside me, looking at me! OH MY GOD DID I JUMP! I just said, 'Hello,' nervously and decided that this was one freak who thought I was guardian-less and saw me as his prey. I walked as fast as I could, pushing my cart, towards my mummy. He was following me a few feet behind. I finally got to the open area of the grocer's section and found my mother. I was pretty scared. Freak. I came home and Leonard said I got a parcel in the post. I didn't expect one, but it was  urlLink Microsoft Office:Mac 2004, Student & Teacher edition!  For my new eMac next week! YAY! Good ol' Grandaddy. He  did  order it for me! I asked him if he would get Toast for me at the same time I asked for Office, so maybe that'll come, too... I hope. I'm so happy!

      Oh, finally! School is out! And not a moment too soon! (But a day or two late, as evidenced by yesterday's little fit.) I feel better about my math exam. I honestly think I got the grade needed. (Mainly because my friend Rebecca Remington and I had a little 'sharing ring' going on, but... it's survival of the cleverest.) My math teacher was one of the most cheating-obtuse people I've known, and due to serious lack of experience, I am not a good cheater. Besides, it was only like 10 problems out of 60... I feel a tad bit guilty, but she should have left us a  professional  teacher instead of some sub who resembled Cheri Oteri's wacked-out druggie character while she was gone, oh, I don't know...  half the semester!  This time, the ends  so  justified the means! It feels no different being a Junior. I guess that'll change later on when school starts again. (Yuck, don't make me even  think  about it.) I just know I have a butt-load of summerwork for AP Psych, AP Language, and AP United States History. [sigh...] As you know, I was invited to the Worth County 4-H Awards Banquet, and I am most certainly going. It's tomorrow evening. How exciting!

      In an effort to boost my  urlLink Fark  submission number, I put in 2 submissions: one about the Conyers fire and then something about jobs and stupid email handles. (You know, the kind like BabyD2034030473âˆž) That always gets on my nerves. If you do funny, do witty, like sockeatingdryer or mr.humphries. LOL I got out of school really early today due to that I only had one exam today. I have washed my hands of 4 classes as of today. Next up: Algebra II and 10th Literature. Speaking of which, I am phreaking out over my Algebra exam. I don't remember how to do all of the stuff on it, and I am so scared. I have to make a 70 or above on my exam to get credit this semester (I'm smart in everything but math and the occasional science) and I don't remember how to do it. Golly-gee, I am in a pickle. I was invited to attend the Worth County 4-H Awards Banquet this Thursday evening. I think I'll do it. I already know what I'm gonna wear. Speaking of 4-H, today's 4-H Day @ Wild Adventures, and most of the cool counties are going. But guess whose county's school system isn't out yet.   ME!!!   You know, this whole pushing-break-back, pulling-first-day thing is really grating on my nerves. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE TRIPS AND I'M MISSING IT BECAUSE THE DAMN SCHOOL BUREAUCRATS THINK THAT MAKING US GO TO SCHOOL MORE IS GOING TO IMPROVE SCORES WHEN IT'S REALLY NOT BECAUSE IT JUST BURNS PEOPLE OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY GET TIRED AND OVER-WORKED! ... [sigh.]

      My first day of exams went pretty well, except for Drama. Urp! My scene partner forgot her lines and started skipping along... I didn't know what to do or how to respond...! To make the long story short, I probably got a horrible grade because  someone  can't do their damn lines. What was  I  supposed to do? Buttface. >:-} I also got my AP U.S. History summer work today. You know, maybe I should not do it this year. It's going to be very hard, doing 3 AP classes. That's three exams, three times as much HW, dear God! What have I gotten myself into?! So here I sit. Home early. Tomorrow I'm out  early.  10:20, to be exact.  You know what, I want some tacos for dinner.

      Forget my comment on 'Reinvention.' Too much has happened already! I get my eMac next week, and you will be seeing the site now. As you can see by my little 'about' section, I am on the Southwest District 4-H Senior Board of Directors. Anyway, we had our get-to-know-each-other Ice Cream Social last weekend. We are all deciding nicknames for our jerseys. I like 'Jigga' (don't ask), and this cool chick named Laura, under my suggestion, is doing 'Freek-A-Leek.' But I just thought that maybe we can do that whole Spears/Timberlake thing. She could be 'Pinky' (which is appropriate considering she loves pink) and I'd be 'Stinky' (even though I am not, it's cool). It'd be innocent fun. I had some Mexican food last night. I was in taste ecstacy, considering I'd been  craving  it for 2 weeks. Oh, and we have exams next week. AAAAAAHHHHH! I am so scared about my math exam. I stink so bad at Algebra. Why would they make me take that crap, anyway? I'm going to be a reporter. Where would I use that at the anchor's desk, may I inquire?

      This is Chris' blog, version 7. I've been a pretty good member of the blogging community since 2000 (the moment before the big boom of blogging), but my  urlLink last one  found me catching flak. So, I'm taking it down permanently. I find Blogging therapeutic, so I'm moving away from the Cary Project and starting over from scratch. I actually find this a good time to start one, since my Sophomore year ends next Wednesday, and I have a big summer ahead of me. I'm also getting a new computer, so by the time you see this I am using an  urlLink eMac  (April 2004 revision). Specs: 8x SuperDrive, 1.25gHz G4, 80G HD, 512M RAM, Bluetooth. I plan on not having to create a new blog for a loooong time. For now, just watch me as my summer unfolds!

      - I was inducted. It was so great. - I got my board polo, my name tag, and my GREEN BLAZER! - One of my best homies, Jamey, got elected to State and is going to GOT with me. Awesome. - I've only gotten a collective 8 hours of sleep out of, what, 72 hours?

      Well, it's "State Council-eve," and I  cannot wait!  Friday will be so awesome when I get there! - Laura and I are talking about all of us Senior Board Members waking up really early (a little before/right when they start serving breakfast) and just going in our pyjamas. No shower, nothing. Just us and bedclothes. Of course, we go back to our cabins and get ready to meet LPJ (that's Dr. Laura to  you ) at 8:30, right before our induction. - That's the only thing I have to say right at the moment. Bye!

      My brother would not stop his damn annoying me about getting a farking  urlLink Gmail  account from me! It was starting to  really  piss me off, so I just made one and gave it to him without giving him a choice of name or password. Spammers, send email to  tyler.uppole@gmail.com  about penis enlargement. I'm sure he needs it. Lawd knows he didn't get any of the same genes as me! A one-parent difference can make a BIG gap, believe me. >:-P - My mother is dragging me to this gay  urlLink train ride  from Cordele to some other hick-town. (don't offend yourselves, Cordele 4-H'ers) I don't want to go, I have to work on my State Congress presentation, gosh-darn it! - That's all that's happened lately. Sorry my life's so boring right now.

      My mom got my report card & next year's schedule (see bottom of post) for me yesterday. I had kinda been dreading the moment, you know, with all that past controversy and all. And that damn Drama exam. (GOD that was embarrassing!) - I am officially a Junior in high school. Yay, team, and all that rot. - I LURVE my new schedule. I have Mr. Davis for 2 consecutive periods. That is a blessing from God! (or maybe a curse from Satan? Time will tell.) And Mrs. Massey. I knew about that, but I'm still overjoyed about it. However, I have my math teacher from Freshman year again. I didn't really like him  then,  why would I now?  Ugh.  - My Drama exam didn't kill me too bad, actually. I still had a high B for the semester. - For Anatomy, I have this Ã¼ber-rightist commando-dude. (The kind that makes us conservatives look bad.) This guy's farther right than me! If there's anything that makes me sick, it's the Ã¼ber-right. I'll be suppressing the gag reflex all year, and it won't be from the dissection labs.   My Schedule  1st - Geometry (Whitman) 2nd - Advanced Drama 2 (Davis) 3rd - AP Language/Compostion (Davis) 4th - AP United States History (Thurman) 5th - Anatomy (Hyde) 6th - AP Psychology (Massey)

      And who doesn't? - Well, I am back at home. The day I got back, I turned on my old iMac, got my Address Book, old Mail, my fonts, etc. and transferred them to my new eMac. It's nice having my iChat buddy list with names again! - I'm phreaking out over State Congress! I haven't had time to think about my Senior Board induction, and next week I will be busy bee working on the physical presentation. Then the next week I will be polishing the nuances, etc, of the new speech. I think I will be moving the concentration from Blogging for personal use to journalistic purposes. And, since I can run Keynote now, you KNOW it will be so much more professional. I'm taking my image to white on black (I'm such a fan of that now, I think I have too many Apple & Miyake influences). I'll be using Gill Sans instead of Myriad Pro, strangely. It'll look good when I'm done with it. I'm sweating bullets over it. It's my baby! - Next week I shall commence the networking. I need to arrange a UPS pick-up of my suit from Rock Eagle, pick a new jersey nickname (apparently the pinky/stinky combo Laura and I have can be construed as pervy), and pay for my summer events. - I still have to pick up my report card and 2004-2005 schedule from the high school. Like I WANT to be reminded of this past year. I'm really afraid Russell tried some retribution on false pretenses with my grades this 6-weeks. Also, I'm a little worried about my Drama exam hurting my semester grade. (DAMN my scene partner! Can't do anything right!) I still can't believe she blamed her forgetting lines on   ME!

      OK, I was going through the MacRumors  urlLink forum  as a sort of victory lap about my eMac coming in, and I saw in this one member's signature that his friend was attempting to put up a Mac-related  urlLink website.  First I thought, "Well good for him!" Then I saw his 19 May entry. Unfortunately it appears that he's only well-informed in the computing area. He's a moron politically. Sorry, buddy: You are a political retard. If you'd rather have someone who has the charm of a plantar wart, the face of a clapped-out nag, the wisdom of Anna Nicole, the leadership ethics of Pol Pot, and the truthfulness of O.J. Simpson, then you are nothing more than a silly little liberal idiot.

      My eMac arrived via FedEx today, if you didn't see using that tracking link. I'm so happy! I'm writing this post on it... everything's all set up, except transferring my Address Book contacts and the rest of the Mail messages I haven't already sent over. All in less than an hour, everything was all done up. That's using an Apple for you. My jaw is still dropping over the performance jump! Of course, after using a 466 G3, anything could be better. But Quartz Extreme has really taken it to the next level. Everything is SO SMOOTH! And talk about fast. And it's so silent! Man, that iMac really always sounded like a wind tunnel (the Bondi Blue iMacs were before they became convection-cooled), but this is so quiet. I will have a hard time sleeping... it will be too quiet in my room. LOL I like this SuperDrive. I'm watching Bridget Jones' Diary right now on it. Amazing how it does in the background, really.

      I went to the taping of "Facing The Giants" and I'm going to be in a movie!  Also, I saw my first, FIRST 'school' best friend from  urlLink Sherwood Christian Academy (Yes, I will and always be a private-school kid.)  It was so cool to see Corey Lawson. Oh, it was so neat. We used to be on the football (soccer) team together, we always sat at the lunch table together, sat in neighbouring desks, played on the playground, etc. (This was Grades 1-3) I felt so sad. Apparently, by the link above, they have a website. I sent an email to my first grade teacher (who is now the head of the entire SCA system) and I checked up on what I've been missing. I want to go back so badly now! It brings back so many good memories (as in my first crush: April O'Keefe, who I saw)! And it brought back the culture shock when I first moved to Lee and had to go to... a public school(!) You know, I've always wanted to be closer to God, and you can't get that in druggie-central Lee County. I think I oughta go back to Sherwood. I'll be driving, and I can ask Grandmomma & Grandaddy to do my tuition. It wouldn't hurt to ask. They have AP English... and a Drama program. I can still go to 4-H. OoOoO I want to so bad, now. :-(

      Well, I ordered my AP Psychology and AP Language reads today from  urlLink Amazon.com.  For AP Language, I have to read  Sophie's World  and  The Crucible.  For AP Psychology, I chose  The Three Faces of Eve  out of a list. (Mainly because I saw the movie in Drama, which is apparently accurate to the book.) So, that's good and all. Also, I mailed in my State Council "Code of Conduct" & "Medical Release" forms for the Board. Oh, and I letter I finished inking to Holly (our former 4-H'er & Program Assistant), who's at camp as a counselor. Other than that, it rained again today.

      Last night, I heard something banging on my window. It was kinda scary, you know, having something bang at your window. Well, it was my cat, Sophie. Somebody must have shut her out. It must have shocked her something good, because when I picked her up at the door, she was shaking. Being in Georgia, you know it wasn't from cold. I need to call my friend to tell him about the beach thing. Maybe I will now.

And stop with that damn typeface.  urlLink "And your little dog, too!"  - I'm going back to my old stylist Doris. She may be more expensive, but she's so. much. better. - Man, the above thought sounds more flaming than Elton. - I really don't have all that much to write about (and  I  make fun of kids who post daily); I just needed something to divert my mind from this  urlLink Neverending Story...!

      I can't think of a title. Or an opening paragraph. Sorry. Like you were disappointed anyway.* - Mom & my stepdad decided to take a trip to town. They only said Jared needed a haircut and they were going to get lunch at Sonny's Barbeque. At first I wasn't going to go, but I did anyway thinking it was going to be quick trip. Then Tyler decided  he  had to go... after finally waking up. That made me a little upset. But I went anyway. Jared got a cut, then we went to lunch, as planned. THEN Mom decided she must go to Staples for Tyler's last school supplies. So we went. Then Leonard (my stepdad) decides he must take an hour and a half at our attourney's office. I hate lawyers. - I got this snazzy USB 2.0 hub that, of course, looks cool with my eMac. But, I'd better not say that... because apparently it labels me as a hipster... Zak. - I'm really considering a new title. If you have any suggestions,  urlLink email me.

      Well, I just wrapped up my 4-H trip of the summer, the Tubing Rally. It was great fun, the skit was so awesome, and I set a new dance trend. LOL I'm rather sad, as the Tubing Rally marks the last event of the 4-H summer season, and it's on to the fall, the Fair, and the harvest! However, it does mean the start of a new 4-H year. So I have a whole new year ahead of me on board and such. 'Reflective Mode Off' - I am going to start excercising. I've got the thin thing down, now I just need some definition fo' sheezy. Since I need to start getting up early and get into the whole swing of things in terms of time cycles for school, I may take some of that extra time and take up jogging. Then I'm going to do drylands from the swim team. Oh, yeah. Grebel. - Well, I have 11 days until school begins. Time to finish Sophie's World and that textbook work! I'm glad I did all my school supply shopping earlier this month. Now all I need is a haircut and I'll be prepared. Good for me. - More than likely I will be  coaching  the Lee County 4-H Challenge Bowl team this year! That is, if there are enough Seniors this time around. I'm thinking there will be enough. If there aren't, of course I'll take the lead of the "A" team again, gladly. But, I've come to understand that things aren't about all about me. I've had my turn, gave it my best shot, and we got 3rd in the state! That's not bad, considering the top 2 were from the same county, and they cheat badly. (Sharing questions and answers with radios, anyone?) So really we placed 1st. LOL. But, I've had my turn, and I want to be a teacher and a leader now. I was elected to be a leader and that's my new role: to set an example. - I've decided to use journalism as a backup. I was told to 'find my passion' at GOT, and my passion is 4-H. Therefore, I'm going a career in 4-H. Start out as a Program Assistant in college, 4-H agent out of college, get promoted to district, then to state... and so forth. - My blog (I can't believe I still have it around!) will have a newer, less gay, name and URL. If you see this from now on, you got an email or someone told you.

Yikes! - I've officially decided I won't do Varsity swimming this year. However, I will be doing some sort of exercise. Taking up running, maybe. I need to do something to get my definition back since there will be no 'on-season.' - I'm going to bed.  Bye!

      I haven't made a real post in a long while. I wondered about this... and I found the reason: by the end of this month, I will have had a 4-H overnight/week-long trip every week this month and 2 weeks of last month. I could say I've spent a total of 1/2 to 1/3 of my summer on 4-H. To quote Neo, "Woah." - Well, State Congress was pretty nice, now that I've had some rest. - (The Positive) I placed second; I saw many of my friends, alot from GOT; I talked to Mrs. Cheryl and making Tech Team sounds like a good possibility; I got closer to many people; I spent some quality time with this pretty girl named Morgan; Six Flags was fun; I love lookin' so fresh and so clean; I met a new person from Tift County (after running, it's hard to find someone new); I beat someone who kinda gets on my nerves - (The Negative) I placed second; I saw many people that get on my nerves; I had roommates from hell*; I didn't have a choice about that quality time; I got too close to some people; My feet hurt from those damn dress shoes every day; That kid from TIft County has a head so big it will float away by 2005. What a jerk. - Now it's time for one of my favourite events of the year... THE TUBING RALLY! I never thought it could get better... until I got elected, that is. It will be so fun! The skit is hilarious and everything is so great. My mum will be going as an adult leader. How neat! - Tech team announcements are at the beginning of the week. Yay!

      Hello State Congress Judges!  See how easy it is to create a professional-looking Blog? You can create something like this in under   5 minutes!    Imagine the possibilities for corporations, professionals, and the like harnessing the power of such ease, versatility, and conciseness... like the internet should be.  Chris.

      ...is a  urlLink Scion xA.  I went and looked at it again at Fairway Toyota. For someone who has one as a stepdad, I sure hate car salesmen. Oh, wait, I forgot... he's a  sales associate.  - Well, I am back, not only in person, but as of now in consciousness from Georgia Officer Training (GOT). I sent in an application for getting in the  urlLink tech team.  This doesn't officially make me a nerd, I tell you. LOL. Actually, I'll be the only Mac guy apparently. - John Kerry selected John Edwards as his vice president. "If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all..." - I've been noticing no comments lately. You  do  know you don't need a Blogger account. You can "post anonymously" and write in your name. Unlike some services... you know who you are and better be glad I like you enough to sign up for spam from Xa.... never mind. - I have been procrastinating long enough. I need to do my AP work  now.  3 books to read, 13 chapters in text books, and 3 papers. Yikes! - State Congress is coming up. I know I won't master, but who cares. LOL

      Lately I've found a lack of things to write about. I'm so busy, but it's with stuff most people would find boring. Maybe I'm outgrowing this stuff? I really just need to get down and make a true webpage than this crap. - Speaking of growing, I think I'm changing... I don't know, maturing? I feel different than I did 3 months ago. How odd. It's more mental than physical. Emotionally I'm different. Perhaps this is the last stage of adolescence. It's odd, though, to have your mental growth faster than physical.... ok, this post is already becoming too reflective to be coherent. - Board update: GOT. Georgia Officer Training is next Tuesday. How exciting! - My mother's going to be a chaperone at this year's 4-H Tubing Rally. This... could be a bad thing or a good thing. ;-) - I'm wanting to wrap up "Sophie's World" this weekend. But, then there's that  urlLink iTunes contest...  so tempting. - I have an immense headache and a yearning for my bed. Good night.

      ...for the 12th time. - 1st period: (Geometry) Lovely. (sarcasm) I've got Mr. Whitman, the math teacher I had my freshman year (different) and some dumb kids in my class who I don't know/don't care for. Except one, who was my buddy in math last year! Yay! We sat together and protect each other from the disgusting masses. ;-) - 2nd period: (Adv. Drama 2) Welp, Mr. Davis won't be here till Monday. Hellacious sub-work to ensue. But everything's fine. Got my best homes wit' me.... and everyone I know and like. Just the Drama crew. [two minutes later] Oh, wait... who are  those  walking in the class? Are they supposed to be in here? Davis will have 'em kicked out within a week. I LOVE THIS CLASS! - 3rd period: (AP Lang/Comp) Yay! I get to stay in the same room for another hour with one of my favourite teachers. This is a tight schedule! And look, some of my buddies are here. This is awesome! - Lunch: Same group, same table. What a coincidence. Cool beans. - 4th period: (AP U.S. Hist) Well, got Mrs. Thurman. What?! A test? Well, I gots this crapola together. Got some good folks in this room. Good period. - 5th period: (Anatomy) Same story as first. I think they try to insult me with my regular classes. Dumb people... all but one. My friend/chica Lindsey! Well, we'll sit together. 5th will be a bucket of laughs. - 6th period: (AP Psych) One of my favourite classes. Gots some seniors up in this room. That's OK, I'm an upperclassman too. Got Mrs. Massey, some cool people.... nothing can go wrong with this class. Perfecto way to end my day.

      Well, here it is. The 'real post' I was alluring to yesterday. The whole enchilada. - My stepdad got a Jack R. pup this past Monday. Her name is Lucy, and boy is she annoying. In an endearing way, I mean, she's OK when sedated. Needless to say, my cat wasn't taking too kindly to this. But she's getting better, with me being her moral cord and all. - School starts on the day after tomorrow. That's bad news. We don't have to take those damn brats next door. That's good news. Our classes are 'abbreviated' on Tuesday. That's good news. Alot of my friends will be gone on the first week of school. That's bad news. In short about the first day:   Meh.   - I read that we don't get our class rings on th first week of school. That really sucks. I want my class ring, darn it. They pushed back the last date of payment, so I think that's part of the reason. Listen, you slackers: if you can't afford it, don't get the farking ring! You ruin it for those of us who can.  There's  why socialism doesn't work. It brings everything down to the lowest common denominator. [/rant off] - I'm wanting an iPod. You may be, too. But for pete's sake, don't do that dumb "free iPod" scam ring. OK?

      To all my fellow 4-H'ers in Ben Hill county (SW District), your town, Fitzgerald, is in the  urlLink news.  Here in Lee County, we have a problem with chickenheads! :-D - Real post tomorrow. I promise.

      ...in large amounts. I was supposed to start my getting up early and running bit this morning, but I had a hard time falling asleep last night, so... you get the rest. My mother says it's stress, probably caused by school starting and my AP work. What's next? Propecia? - Well, I finished my big fat book report for AP Psychology yesterday evening. It's somewhat more significant including the fact that I had to take a fast 101 on the MLA format, which I did not know before yesterday. I did a damn good job @ 1,219 words. Eve, you had three faces. - Now, it's on to the textbook work. AP Pysch wants three chapters read and notes taken. AP US Hist want ten chapters read and notes. Buggers!
