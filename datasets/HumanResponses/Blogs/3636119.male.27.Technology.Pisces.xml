      The good folks at  urlLink Super Hero Hype  have posted a picture of a concept statue of The Thing for the Fantastic Four movie. It's apparently from a makeup show and could be exactly or nothing like it at all.  Click  urlLink here  for the story.  UPDATE: Ok so it's NOT what the Thing will look like. It's another fx company's bid. That company did not get the contract.

      Ok so after what feels like a month of sleep I'm alive again.   I also realized this blog is a little bit boring. Ok so it's a lot boring. Ok so it even puts me to sleep and it's my life I'm writing about. I plan on spicing it up a bit. Details to follow.

      Wow. The  urlLink Iced Earth  show rocked last night. They played a really tight, fast set. After getting to bed at 3 A.M. though I'm a wee bit tired. Damn, I'm not 22 anymore. Who am I kidding, I was a wuss back then too.

      Ok so the Shield last night was excellent. Season 4 coming in 2005?!?!? Ugh. Now the Dead Zone is officially the only show on tv worth watching until 24 comes back.  'Iced Earth' concert tonight in Rhode Island. It's going to kick ass. I'm warming up to Tim Owens so we'll see how they are live.

      Michael Chicklis was on the radio this morning. He was different than I thought. Definitely funnier. Though I really think I expected Vic Mackey setting radio people on fire. Oh well.  This is a shameless plug to watch The Shield. You won't regret it.     urlLink http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/the_shield/   urlLink http://www.theshieldfans.com/

      From the "I can't believe thjs actually happened" file: &nbsp; "Some California legislators are angry with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger after he referred to them as "girlie-men" during a speech on Saturday. " &nbsp; So awesome. &nbsp; "The movie star-turned-politican used the term to describe opposition Democrats he said who are too weak to stand up to unions and trial lawyers demanding changes in the governor's state budget proposal. " &nbsp; And he also said that if they did not approve his budget proposals it would be the "End of Days for them!" Also they would have a "Total Recall of the State's past budget problems." &nbsp; I love the governator. &nbsp; News Source  urlLink Voice of America News   &nbsp; Sorry about the rehashed jokes. They're still funny to me.

      Ok so the size of the car pics sent my little sidebar packing. It's on the bottom of the screen now. I need to shrink the car pics a little when i get a chance. I used to be good at this whole "World Wide Web" thing. :) &nbsp; Update: I fixed it. Go me. :)

      Ok so here's the new wheels. Yes, I'm definitely a dad in this car. It's an '05 Toyota Carolla.  Thanks to  urlLink AutoFair  in Manchester for all of the help. They were great to deal with and they have really good pricing.   Toyota dealerships can be a solid pain in the ass to deal with in general. I like Autofair but I had to go there twice to find a salesperson I liked.  Anyway, so here's the rig:  Outside:          Inside:     These pictures are a little bright, but I didn't really want to screw around with them too much.     And of course, the trunk:   Yeah this thing basically has a mafia trunk. It can fit 37 Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders with the help of a chainsaw. Thanks to Boo(tm) for that joke.
