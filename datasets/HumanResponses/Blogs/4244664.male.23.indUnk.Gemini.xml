      I just did my first day of training at the track. Imagine a thousand  urlLink Henry Chinaskis  quietly barking numbers and code like "per" "Tri" while you stare at a keyboard not knowing what you're doing.  Kelly (of the rob-dan-kelly) chain was also applying for a job there. I wonder if she went crazy or not.  The big question is whether or not I should drive 2 hours for this job or not. Hmm. I have no clue. same thing tomorrow I guess.

       urlLink This is sick and makes me want to puke.    urlLink Sorry Amers, you have to be 18 or younger for the double double dash tournaments.    urlLink half of the blair witch brains team is RIP (poor guy).   I can't cook. I feel like a hated housewife most of the time. My best effort isn't good enough. I'm going to stick to writing. This zine should produce some blossoms. I hope the NC likes it and that I can do it in a timely fashion. Maybe I'll start tonight.

      my sleep has been on off lately. I'm tired now, but probably not in five minutes.  urlLink Bob Mould has a blog ! Those of you who are unfamiliar with the god of post-punk should read it. Smart guy. Kind of dwells on being gay a bit. But hey, who doesn't?  For some reason I can get people's friends-only journals on my rss-eater thing (which is good). Only when I'm logged in on livejournal, and I'm their friend. This is good news! I noticed it with Manuel's journal, but couldn't crack my way into other people's journals. Hmmm...  Tomorrow, Gardening, eating eggs. Same thing as yesterday.  I've been reading so much news aggregated its scary!

      I had to shrink this picture for my blogger icon. I am a sell-out for getting a blogger aren't I?     If you don't hear from me again it's because Amers has killed and buried me.    Amy took it, I don't know why. but it looks cool.   come to ram's horn    My name is ryan and I don't know how cars work      awww....     our new pet.   our new ice cream pet that I ate.
