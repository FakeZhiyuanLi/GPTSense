      Lesson of Life       Once upon a time there was a race ... by frogs   The goal was to reach the top of a high tower.      Many people gathered to see and support them. The race began.  In reality, the people probably didn't believe that it was possible that  the frogs could reach the top of the tower, and all the phrases that one  could hear were of this kind :    "What pain !!! They ll never make it!"        The frogs began to resign, except for one who kept on climbing        The people continued :   "... What pain !!! They'll never make it!..."      And the frogs admitted defeat, except for the frog who continued to insist. At the end, all the frogs quit, except the one who, alone and with an enormous effort, reached the top of the tower. The others wanted to know how did he do it. One of them approached him to ask him how he had done it - to finish the race.      And discovered that he... was deaf! ...Never listen to people who have the bad habit of being negative...  because they steal the best aspirations of your heart! Always remind yourself of the power of the words that we hear or read. That's why, you always have to think positive     POSITIVE !    Conclusion:   Always be deaf to someone who tells you that you can't and won't achieve  your goals or make your dreams come true.
