      i don't know about anyone else's crushin' style, but mine usually involves several hotties of the male gender, sometimes a female, that i work with...and it's just because i'm around them all the time...you can't help it, i even read that there is some horomone or something that people secrete that being in it's presence (through close and/or frequent contact) makes you happier, thus feeling better about yourself, thus you begin to ponder the idea of a fling or even a full blown relationship.  that's the science behind it anyway.  i try to keep, as a friend would say, my assets spread out--lots of mini, non-serious crushes.  but this time, one got away...it took off in a dead sprint and before i knew it, i had a full-blown, yearnin' n' pinin' crush on my co-worker.  i know it won't behoove me any and so tried to convince myself i didn't like him just to protect myself from the inevitable rejection--it sure helped when i noticed his burnin' flame for some other chick (the derogatory sense implied here please).  that tingly-ache still fizzles in my chest  everytime i see him hug her so sweetly though and so i know it's not over, i'll just have to keep building that bridge until i'm far enough on the otherside to burn it...

      i know all the business about optimism saving and lengthening your life...blah, blah, blah...but sometimes i just have a down day.  used to be i could turn that day into weeks and months, but alas, i'm changing my ways, i'm adopting a new outlook.  those one day things are a bitch though.  i just can't help getting sucked into the black hole that is missing someone.  especially those someones that have died, there is no cure for that lonliness.  you think maybe alcohol or painkillers could fill the void, but they seem to just acidically eat away the edges making it so much bigger.  so how are you supposed to deal with missing people or things or intimacy, because really, that's where a  lot of bad habits stem from.  that's the reason i still call my ex-boyfriend and say things like "i don't care about any of the stuff that happened between us because i still love you no matter what!!!"  while that may be true, there were a lot of serious reasons for us breaking up and logic says it won't work out.  it's just that logic isn't always in accordance with our feelings and i'd like to say not only does that suck, but it's also confusing as hell!  and so i wonder is life a competition to fake it?  in the end, if you can be happy with all the shit that happens (and it happens to EVERYBODY)  is that the meaning...the purpose?  if it is, maybe i should go looking for trouble and fudge my way through it with a big ol' grin.  then of course, i'm afraid murphy's law would kick in and i wouldn't be able to find trouble if i was riding in it.  and so it goes that i'm going to stick up my chin, and grin, and sing...as long as life is still in the making, it's still sweet.
