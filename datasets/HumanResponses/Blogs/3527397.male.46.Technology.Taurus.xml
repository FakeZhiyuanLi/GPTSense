       Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage  And then is heard no more: it is a tale  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,  Signifying nothing.  -The Bard

      What can you do? Even the best laid plans can fail.  Over all a good day. The new low carb Atkins diet is no real stress and I am prob. eating better.  I do need to pull out the Nordic trak and start exercising to speed things up. I would also not be surprised to find out it makes me feel better.  I have been dry long enough to not have to worry on that account and need to get off the sugar.  The job lead is still hot.

      Fine she wants to take my happiness and kill it? Fine! Have at it it's what she does best! So what's a wife for anyway if not to ensure your misery and murder your hope.  Hell I'm not even allowed the luxury of bitterness.

      Hate   4364. I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.  James Baldwin  4365. Hatred is self-punishment. Hosea Ballou  4366. Hatred is the vice of narrow souls; they feed it with all their littlenesses, and make it the pretexts of base tyrannies. Honore' De Balzac          4367. Forcible ways make not an end of evil, but leave hatred and malice behind them. Sir Thomas Browne         4368. Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule. Buddha  4369. Never in this world can hatred be stilled by hatred; it will be stilled only by non-hatred - this is the law eternal. Gautama Buddha       4370. Hatred is the madness of the heart. Baron George Gordon Byron        4371. Hate burns up more energy than anything else, more than hard work, illness or justifiable worry.  So when hatred is entering our hearts, let us just put it out, make room for pleasant thoughts instead, save our precious God-given energy for something worthy of it. Dale Carnegie         4372. When we hate our enemies, we are giving them power over us: power over our sleep, our appetites, our blood pressure, our health, and our happiness.  Our enemies would dance with joy if only they knew how they were worrying us, lacerating us, and getting even with us!  Our hate is not hurting them at all, but our hate is turning our own days and nights into a hellish turmoil. Dale Carnegie          4373. The price of hating other human beings is loving oneself less. Eldridge Cleaver  4374. We hate some persons because we do not know them; and we will not know them because we hate them. Charles Caleb Colton         4375. There is no hate without fear.  Hate is crystallized fear, fear's dividend, fear objectives.  We hate what we fear and so where hate is, fear is lurking.  Thus we hate what threatens our person, our liberty, our privacy, our income, popularity, vanity and our dreams and plans for ourselves.  If we can isolate this element in what we hate we may learn to cease from hating. Cyril Connolly          4376. There is a community of hatred.  Hatred floods your mind with the ideas of the one you hate.  Your thought reflects his, and you act in his spirit.  If you wish to be like your enemy, to be wholly his, open your mind and hate him. Charles Horton Cooley          4377. Hatred - The anger of the weak. Alphonse Daulet          4378. It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love.  This is how the whole scheme works. All good things are difficult to achieve and all bad things are very easy to get. Morarji Desai            4379. We shall always discover reasons, which we shall proclaim inevitable and divinely ordained, for hating one another. Paul Eldridge          4380. There are glances of hatred that stab and raise no cry of murder. George Eliot  4381. Hating people is like burning down your own house to get rid of a rat. Harry Emerson Fosdick           4382. He that fears your presence will hate your absence. Thomas Fuller   4383. Hate is a dead thing.  Who of us would be a tomb? Kahlil Gibran     4384. Hatred is active, and envy passive dislike; there is but one step from envy to hate. Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe          4385.  Hate is that evil  State of mind Which feeds the worst In human kind.   Edgar A. Guest          4386. A man's hatred is always concentrated upon that which makes him conscious of his bad qualities.  Carl Gustav Jung           4387. Hate is always tragic.  It is as injurious to the hater as it is the hated.  It distorts the personality and scars to the soul.  As a race we must work passionately and unrelentingly for first-class citizenship, but we must never use second-class methods to gain it. Luther King          4388. We never get to love by hate, least of all by self-hatred. Basil W. Maturin          4389. The rage of the southern poor white against the Negro suspected of some dereliction is referable to the hate he feels inwardly at having been like the Negro, unwanted.  The same is perhaps true in the situation of Germans and Jews and in many other situations which give the opportunity for the expression of hatred in the feeling of being rejected. Dr. Karl A. Menninger      4390. It would be a rather serious error if the child did not learn to hate certain things.  The real fact seems to be that he does not learn to hate; he comes into the world equipped with it, for better or for worse, and then he learns to use it, wisely or unwisely according to his experiences. Dr. Karl A. Menninger          4391. If I wanted to punish an enemy it should be by fastening on him the trouble of constantly hating somebody. Hannah More            4392. Psychiatrists today see the irrational hostility that people everywhere vent upon one another as chiefly projected self-hate. Bonaro Overstreet            4393. Hate is always a clash between our spirit and someone else's body. Cesare Pavese  4394. Dislike what deserves it, but never hate, for that is of the nature of malice, which is applied to persons, not to things. William Penn         4395. If you hate your enemies, you will contract such a vicious habit of mind as by degrees will break out upon those who are your friends, or those who are indifferent to you.   Plutarch           4396. When our hatred is violent, it sinks us even beneath those we hate. Francois de La Rochefoucauld          4397. The value of love will always be stronger than the value of hate.  Any nation or group of nations which employs hatred eventually is torn to pieces by hatred. Franklin Delano Roosevelt            4398. Hatred of enemies is easier and more intense than love of friends.  But from men who are more anxious to injure opponents than to benefit the world at large no great good is to be expected. Lord Bertrand Russell          4399. Hatred is the coward's revenge for being intimidated. George Bernard Shaw        4400. The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them; that's the essence of inhumanity. George Bernard Shaw         4401. Malice can always find a mark to shoot at and a pretense to fire Charles Simmons  4402. Hate is able to provoke disorders, to ruin a social organization, to cast a country into a period of bloody revolutions; but it produces nothing. Georges Sorel        4403. It is human nature to hate him whom you have injured. Tacitus          4404. There are people who will hide their love from you, and people who hide their hate, and you will be wise to stay away from both. Author Unknown          4405. The neurotic usually obeys his own Golden Rule: Hate thy neighbor as thyself. Author Unknown        4406. Hate pollutes the mind. Author Unknown           4407. Hatred is cancer of the intellect. Author Unknown          4408. Doctors tell us that hating can cause cancer, heart attacks, headaches, skin rashes, and asthma.  It doesn't make the people we hate feel too good either. Author Unknown  4409. Hate is the most inefficient use a person can make of his mind. Author Unknown       4410. Hatred is a luxury no one can afford. Author Unknown           4411.

      People more and more need to hate. I do not want to hate any one so I am a perfect target for hate.   You hate me because I have a receding hairline.  You hate me because I am over-weight. God are they gearing up to hate the fat.  You hate me because I am a "nice" guy and that deserves your scorn.  You hate me because I do not have wealth.  You hate me because I tried to be happy.  You hate me because I wont share your hate.  I will always be hated and their is nothing I can do about it.

      Let's face it, there is no happiness to life. To delude yourself into believing such a thing exists just sets you up as a target for all the people who can't understand why they are so miserable.   No I will NEVER be happy..All I can do is minimize the pain. If I accept the fact that no one wants me to have joy will hopefully make them stop attacking me.  There is nothing left to make life good so I must try to avoid some of the pain.  Life sucks and then you die.  I promise never to be happy now please just leave me alone.

      A Second Adulthood? I like the sound of it! Hell I did okay with the first one before I crashed and burned. So now I can start over and take advantage of my experience.  I find I would like to stay in the same field and in fact feel rejuvenated. I like working with computers.  I also know that loyalty to a work place is an illusion so this time around I will look out for myself. I can even have fun doing it because I don't feel the need to advance at all costs.  I can see now that I let others push me into things I didn't want to do. Why go into management if you don't care if the company lives or dies? Right?  I will pursue my own interests and see where they take me. Let everyone else flail around in misery. I want to live laugh and love.  Who cares who's president or if there's a war on I can't change it so I'm not going to worry about it. This country deserves a 911 attack every week. If they want it let them have it I can't change it so I'll keep my head down. Enjoy, I'll be making a pesto pizza!  Hey now! This is liberating, I like it man. A second adulthood on my own terms.

      I seem to have tweaked my back today. Crap!! I hate this! My back has been stable for years. What the hell is going on? Now it will have to be worked.  I love the way liberals have been sitting on their hands re: Reagan. It has too be killing them to be civil, certainly not a normal state of affairs for this bunch.  The "experts" now say dogs can understand words. Gee tell us dog lovers something we didn't know. And we are supposed to believe that global warming exists? HAHAHA! Nice try, I think I will go out and murder a tree today :)

      I love what that guy did in Granby, way cool. More people should do the same. Long live the revolution!  I saw that 250,000 new jobs in May. Great the economy is finally getting going. Now if we can just keep the terrs. from causing another 911 we can all get back to work. I would love to finally get a better job. I have paid my dues doing this one. I will never, ever, ever, EVER give any company the slightest bit of loyalty for the rest of my life. From now on I look out for number one. Hey they showed their true colors when all the layoffs went down so they get what they gave. Fuck them! I will walk away from a project and screw over an entire team depending on me for another $1.00 an hour.No loyalty on more baby!

       Check it out:        Middle East - AP      Iraq PM: U.S. Departure Would Be Disaster   10 minutes ago    By HAMZA HENDAWI, Associated Press Writer   BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraq (news - web sites)'s new prime minister made his first address to the nation Friday, saying security was his top priority, calling for an end to guerrilla attacks and telling Iraqis that the withdrawal of U.S.-led troops now would be a "major disaster."    AP Photo    AFP    Slideshow: Iraq     Cleric Gives Tacit Boost to New Iraqi Gov't  (AP Video)        Latest headlines:   · Sadr militia, army signal truce, toll of US killed in action hits 600  AFP - 3 minutes ago   · Iraq PM: U.S. Departure Would Be Disaster  AP - 10 minutes ago   · Pope Urges Bush to Hasten Iraq Self Rule  AP - 14 minutes ago   Special Coverage             The televised speech by Iyad Allawi — a longtime exile with close ties to the CIA (news - web sites) and State Department but with little popular support in Iraq — was the first by an Iraqi head of government since Saddam Hussein (news - web sites) fell a year ago.    For the past year, such addresses have come from L. Paul Bremer, the top official in the U.S. occupation authority — or from the president of the U.S.-picked Iraqi Governing Council, a position that rotated every month.    Allawi, appointed last week to head the interim government taking power on June 30, told Iraqis: "Your government sees that only the restoration of security and the safeguarding of citizens' dignity, honor and money will allow us to successfully proceed on the political track and achieve the transfer of full sovereignty."    He defended the continued presence of 138,000 U.S. troops and thousands of troops from other nations on Iraqi soil even after the handover of sovereignty.    "The targeting of the multinational forces under the leadership of the United States to force them to leave Iraq would inflict a major disaster on Iraq, especially before the completion of the building of security and military institutions," Allawi said.    "And I would like to mention here that the coalition forces, too, have offered up the blood of their sons as a result of terror attacks," he said.    The speech was aired on Al-Iraqiyah, the nationwide TV station set up and funded by the United States, and was picked up by Arab satellite stations Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya. Throughout the speech, the camera focused tightly on Allawi's face, giving no indication of where he was speaking from.    Allawi also said the new president, Ghazi al-Yawer, will attend the Group of Eight summit being hosted by President Bush (news - web sites) in Sea Island, Ga. next week.    Allawi was named to head the 33-member government in part because he was seen as strong on security. The administration will rule Iraq until elections are held by Jan. 31 to create a national assembly, which will then choose a new government.    The prime minister thanked the United States, Britain and other coalition nations for their role in ousting the former regime. But he added "Iraqis can never accept occupation."    "We are ready to end the occupation and receive sovereignty on June 30 and our government has begun effective participation in the ongoing discussions in the (U.N.) Security Council to adopt a new resolution regarding the transfer of full sovereignty to the interim Iraqi government," he said.    Allawi said his administration would work toward national unity after the divisions created by the fall of Saddam Hussein and the U.S. occupation.    "Former Baathists can live with dignity in society so long as they have not committed any crimes," he added.    The government will soon issue regulations on the entry of foreigners into the country. Iraqis have complained that U.S. forces were not diligent enough in curbing the entry of foreign terrorists and criminals following the collapse of Saddam's regime in April 2003.    Allawi, a Shiite Muslim, also expressed appreciation to the country's most influential Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani, and others in the "revered religious leadership in supporting the political process..."    Al-Sistani gave a tacit endorsement of the new government if it succeeds in regaining full sovereignty, preparing for new elections, and improving security and conditions for Iraq's 25 million people.          On the economy, Allawi cited inflation, unemployment and a weak purchasing power as the main economic problem facing Iraq. He said the government planned to stabilize the exchange rate for the dinar, improve living conditions and boost oil output. He offered no details.

      We must see this through! We either pacify the mid-east now or we do it later at a much higher cost.  Don't cry for terrorists remember 911 they started this fight and we must end it if we have to kill 100 million of them.  Remember:  They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.                                  -Ben Franklin

      When oh when will they reach the IT field, ay? I have been preparing, getting my long over due A+ and Network+ certifications. I am now working on my MCP(WindowsXP). Will they help as the economy improves? I hope so, and, so after the MCP what next? Either go for the MCSA or the CCNA. One must improve one's martketability, shouldn't one?  My current job supporting the poor abused customers of CompUSA is not taxing and helps pay the bills. It also allows me to study for the certs..  Bush will win this fall much to the dismay of the haters out there :)

      I'm feeling much better today...Thank you my Higher Power. Cruising toward 4 mos. sober and I fall into depression. On the bright side I did not want to drink. I just feel bad for the people that have to deal with me. But! When I'm good I'm real good!  I realize that the day at a time approach is the only way to go. I's all we really have control over in any meaningful way. Take care of business today and tomorrow will take care of it's self.
