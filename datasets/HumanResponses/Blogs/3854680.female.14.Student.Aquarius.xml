       I wanna test this new font. :-P    &nbsp;  Okay, back from South Carolina. It was fun, if you "forget" about the whole 'getting up at 6/7 EVERY morning' thing. I went down there with $120, and came back with $ 0.35.. hahaha..    &nbsp;  Yeah, the plane ride down wasn't bad, because the plane wasn't&nbsp;tiny like they made it sound..it was LARGE. I mean..HUGELY large. We had a layover in Detroit, Michigan (their airport is the COOLEST of the cool), and needless to say, the plane after that was the smaller of the two. The first day, we went shopping (shocker...?) and then tried to go on this ghost tour thing, but the tourguide never showed up (yeah, what the hell, right?).     &nbsp;  The next day, we went to Fort Jackson and saw Chad. That Army Base is HUGE!! Holy Cow..we got lost so many times. It was awesome seeing all of those army guys walking around in their cool outfits, though. ^_~    I was correct, his face thinned out a LOT. He didn't LOSE weight, so much as he gained muscle. He IS smaller, don't get me wrong, but he's not "skinny". What's left, though, is all muscle. Holy Cow, eh?   Okay, I'm backing it up. When we first got to the base (our hotel was about half a mile away, it was really close and not bad or hard to find at all), we had to go to this briefing thing where they basically made us cry by telling us how wonderful our family members were and showing us movie&nbsp;clips of them but not actually letting us SEE them. Then we walked outside, and,&nbsp;low and behold, there&nbsp;were TONS of soldiers out there. Maybe around 800? Anyways, I'm scanning the crowd for my big brother, and then I hear, "KARI!!" and I turn, and there's Chad, with my dad, grandpa, mom, sister, and grandma crowded around him. I ran up to him and was just SHOCKED. No more slouching. Everything he said came out completely clear-no muttering, no stumbling over words, no stuttering, he barely even paused to think. His patience has grown TONS and TONNNNNS, and he looked amazing in his army thingy. He's also a lot more generous-he flat out told me to go into his bedroom and use whatever I found in there to my convinience. Before, if he even caught the scent of my shampoo in there, he'd throw a fit. But anyways, have you ever seen those old movies, where they see their loved one in an airport, and drop all luggage and forget about everyone around them except for that ONE person, because they missed them sooo much that they're all that matters? That's kinda how I would believe that I felt. My knees were SO weak, and I was about to burst out crying because I was so happy to see him. Of course, it was different because those are all about "I love you, let's get married and create some offspring on our honeymoon" kinda things, but that's kind of the only way I can explain it. We could take him places, but only on base. We took him to Burger King. The whole thing was odd, because they have all of this fun stuff on base (including a waterpark) but the soldiers barely even know about it. Chad only knew there was a Burger King because he saw it when they went out for jogs every day. There was a hour and a half wait in line before we got the food, and it took Chad about 5 minutes to eat it all. He goes, "Wow, you're slow." and I go, "No, you're just incredibly fast.." After&nbsp; few seconds, he goes, "Yeah, I guess so..I only have 10 minutes to eat my food everyday."    We went to all of these army stores that you can only be in if you have a soldier with you (well, it's SUPPOSED to be that way, even though we went in there later without him and didn't face any problems..) I bought 2 T-Shirts, a hat, a bumper sticker, blah blah blah, the list goes on forever. Hey, I'm never gonna be there again, and it was MY money..why not splurge a little? ^_~..    &nbsp;  Whatever, even though he acted all proper, I knew that my brother was in there somewhere.    &nbsp;  ..Mostly because when nobody was listening, he'd still joke around with me.   Good 'Ol Chad.    &nbsp;  The&nbsp;third day was his graduation.&nbsp;It was odd..they all lined up on one end of&nbsp;a huge field, marched over to the center, repeated a bunch of stuff, marched over to&nbsp;this OTHER field, said a bunch of stuff, and it was all over. It couldn't have lasted more than&nbsp;30 minutes. It took us forever to find him, though. I stood over by the buses (if the soldiers couldn't find their family, they were instructed to get on the bus and ride over to the place where we first met them, so&nbsp;they could meet&nbsp;up).&nbsp;so if he couldn't find us and headed over there, I would see him before he got on one. That day, we were allowed to take him off-campus, so we brought him out to eat (of course) and to a museum. To tell you the truth, I don't remember exactly where else we took him, but whatever. He had to be back earlier than the other soldiers that night (he had to be back at 7:30, they had to be back at 9:00) because he had fireguard duty (which really wasn't fair to any of us, but there's no use in complaining). So of course we brought him back early and everything, but this time he had a C.D. player, 3 C.D.'s, a bunch of cards, soap, and batteries. It was sort of a present to him, because after Bootcamp, they were allowed to have the stuff. The soap, however, was something he asked for, because they had some girly stuff that he didn't like.    When we said goodbye, my mom cried, my sister ALMOST cried, and my dad and grandpa were close to tears. This is something Chad's always wanted, and yeah, I miss him like hell, but I don't want to make him feel bad by crying in front of him, so I did the best I could to keep it in. What really got me was when my grandma started crying. It was hard to keep it in, then, because when you see your grandma cry..well, it's a horrible thing to see. Trust me.     &nbsp;  The fourth day we toured mansions, which was kinda cool, but not as great as you would've expected. We also went and saw the rest of the museum that we missed the day before, and drove to the airport to make sure that we knew where it was. We were gonna go on the ghost tour, but it wasn't until 9:00 that night, and my mom's a wimp. ^_~    &nbsp;  Fifth day, got up, went to the airport, RUSHED to get to the next flight on time (we got there as it was boarding), got to the Milwaukee Airport, my aunt drove us home. End of story. This thing is too long, anyways. I bet right now, if you're reading this sentence, you haven't read the whole thing.    &nbsp;  ..You jerk. ^_~    &nbsp;  By the way, I AM happy to be home, and I DID miss you all. Don't be too depressed. ^_~

      Alrighty, then. We leave tomorrow for South Carolina (in case you couldn't hear my Southern accent, there was one. ^_~). I love you all, and I'll miss you all dearly. Andrew, I'll make an attempt to call you if my sister allows it (it would be her cellphone, if it was going to happen). If I don't, I apologize greatly. You always have Emily to call (although, when you're gone, I just deal with it and don't call anybody..^_~).  Deanna, if you're reading this, the post underneath this is Clay. Quit freaking out going, "SHE LIED TO ME! SHE BROKE THE PROMISE!!"  ..I didn't.   TALK TO YOU ALL IN A WEEK!  *MUAH!*

       urlLink    I made a promise that I have to keep. A few days ago (the..10th? Correct me if I'm wrong, Dea), Deanna Joy Strasse went to Appleton, Wisconsin to a Clay Aiken concert, and actually got to TOUCH Clay. I promised her that I would post this, shouting it to the world. Deanna's dream come true. Congrats, shveetie pie!

Alrighty then, I don't know if I'm going to post again before leaving, or not. If I don't, then bye and I love you all, and if I do, well, then just forget about this post, kay? ^_~

      I just got woken up by a call from Grandma..it's quarter to ten. I can't decide if this is early for me, or late..  It's weird, because I kept getting woken up by noises around every half hour (7:00, 7:30, 8:00..), and kept blaming my mom since all of the animals were right by me. But I just looked at the alarm clock, and it says that she got up at 5:00, which means she started at 6:00..which means she wasn't even HERE.  ..hm..   Creepiest dream..me and 2 other friends were driving in a car (me being the driver) and this guy pulls out in front of us..I swerve to avoid him and end up going into the other lane, where this semi crashes into my side of the car. Next thing I know, people are by my bedside at the hospital crying and praying and stuff, but I'm like.."wait..am I dead..how can I be standing RIGHT HERE and no one can see me..???"  Then I woke up.   Well, the countdown begins..3 days till I go to South Carolina.

      I just posted 2 more pics-one of me, and one of Andrew. I should put the one up of me in my Martha Stewart costume at Halloween. ;)  Today, I got yelled at (BEFORE I even got up), then got woken up again, yelled at, got ready, got called by Andrew and had an extremely short conversation, then went shopping until around 3:00. Oh, fun. I cashed my check ($125.84), bought 2 books ($1.98 & 14.97), bought a headband ($4.00) and a new bag (mom insisted that I had one that could go over my shoulder- $10.00). Now I have somewhere around $90 left to take to South Carolina to buy useless crap with.   Ya know, 2 weeks ago if someone would've told me that I would have $125, I would have laughed at them. Then I would've freaked because of how much money that is.  ..I'm discovering that it really ISN'T that much, and this discovery depresses me greatly.  We're leaving at around 5:00 on Tuesday morning to go to South Carolina, then getting back in..around..a week..? South Carolina doesn't seem that exciting, but I get to see my brother, and our hotel doesn't have a time limit on the pool, so it's all good. Hopefully they'll have cool crap to buy at the Army Base (for those of you that don't know, my brother enlisted in the Army, and is graduating on July 15. That's why we're going down there).  Then the week after that, Andrew has county fair. 2 more weeks of no Andrew. Stupid summertime.   So my computer is really retarded..

      I posted my attackers below. Dunno why, just kinda..felt like it. I want you all to see who's making my life a living hell.  By the way, if at any point during reading these posts you feel like I'm complimenting these sad excuses for humans, just keep in mind that anything that sounds nice is pure sarcasm.  After this I'm putting up one more of me and Andrew. This one is actually pretty cute.

       Muuuuch better day than yesterday. No stupid people online, no degrading calls from daddy, nothing bad. My sister came over and started saying that I couldn't go to 6 Flags, but they're not going this weekend anyways, so it's no big deal. I may go to a movie tomorrow, though.   I went golfing with Andrew (putt-putt golfing..I think that's how it's spelled..whatever..) today, and kicked his little behind. ^__~  ..Actually, no, he beat me. Most likely by a LARGE margin. But that's okay, we can pretend that I won. ^__^ Then Culver's, where I spilled a bunch of melted shake all over the table. I can't really feel bad for the person responsible for cleaning it up, though..*I* clean tables..it isn't as horrible as people think. "*GASP!* DID SHE JUST SAY THAT SHE DOESN'T PITY THE WORKERS AT A LOW-PAYING FAST FOOD RESTAURANT!! HOW DARE SHE!!"   -Yes, I did say that. *I* WORK AT ONE. Uh-oh? Send the cops after me. Please. I dare you.  Then Andrew dropped me off and met my Zoey and Pepper and birds, and saw the extremely dirty fish tank (yeah, gotta clean that sometime..), but I stopped him before going in my room. Disaster zone. Sorry Andrew, but seriously, *I* don't even go in there unless I have to. Honestly.  So, I have *NO* life. Right when I get through the door, I sat down at the computer, checked my messages, my email, Beautiful Dreamer for updates, and then came on here to make a post. I think I may actually keep up with this one. I have about 40 different web diaries that I never did anything with, because..well, if no one reads them, then what's the point..? Hopefully all of my buddies at Beautiful Dreamer will keep my butt motivated to update.  When I get back from South Carolina (leaving..Tuesday..I think?), I'm gonna take my next paycheck and develop film. School film, party film, everything. I'm gonna get my pictures P.O.S.T.E.D. I have to do it sometime.  Wow, am I tired..  AND I FINALLY GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE..Praise the LORD!!! ..I was going insane. My life was; get up, go to work, come home, go on the phone/internet, go to sleep, get up, and do it all over again. It sounds okay, but doing it every day of the summertime SUCKS. So I'm in a much better mood now (Gotta love Andrew's Mom).  So this concludes my post. He-ave a ne-ice de-ay.  ..Oh, Elemental, thanks for the comment. It's much appreciated. And enjoyed. Go ahead, harass her, warn her, do whatever ya wanna do to her. Have fun. I'm done with sticking up for her or trying to save her ass. Hell, if I wouldn't have blocked her already, *I'd* be harassing her. Oh man, would I be harassing her..

      I'm  INCREDIBLY sick of Ashley. If what I said doesn't bother her, then why won't she just LEAVE ME ALONE?! Seriously, she has all of her little friends ganging up on me now, because she can't stick up for herself. Read this, you'll understand (auto response is my away message, for all of you non-IMmers):  FezRus7211: your a bitch! ur an ugly fuckin duish! This is ashley and mary and kaihla! we hate u so bad. the only ass u can get is a gurl, cough cough. ur such as fuckin ugly loser. omg u r just so damn sick to look at ur face.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Auto response from xOxInnocenTxOx27: Oh, Lord, am I tired..  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FezRus7211: ur face looks like my ass FezRus7211: only my ass is hotter then you ever wish to be FezRus7211: if only the world could see how ugly kari really is FezRus7211: sigh FezRus7211: she has no friends and a shim bf FezRus7211: o wait you are a man so i guess it all works out FezRus7211: stop saying bad shit about ashley shes prettyer then ull ever be u hoe FezRus7211: i talked to dylan and he doesnt even know who you are and we showed him your pic and he said what the hell happened to her? FezRus7211: got nothing to say now bitch?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Auto response from xOxInnocenTxOx27: Oh, Lord, am I tired..  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FezRus7211: tired from what sleeping with your girlfriend  My response to her: xOxInnocenTxOx27: I don't sleep with people, I'm not a slut like Ashley. I was at work all day, because I do things other than complaining and being an immature little girl. My mommy doesn't have to tie my shoelaces anymore. No, Dylan didn't say that he didn't know me, because he does. I don't know if he said that I was ugly or not, and to tell you the truth, I could give less of a shit. And I never said I wanted to be prettier than Ashley, so get over it. xOxInnocenTxOx27: Don't you have anything better to do with your time? xOxInnocenTxOx27: Get a life.   I'm trying to be mature about this whole thing (it may not seem like it, but there's SO many things i want to say about her, to her, and DO to her, just to torture her at little bit right now..). Compared to what I want to do, that's mature enough for me. In all honesty, I'm about to kick some blonde little butt. "Shim bf"? Why does she have to bring him into this? He didn't do ANYTHING to her, and he wasn't even involved in our argument. She doesn't have enough crap on me to get me angry, so she has to bash those that I care about.  I'm ready to bash her head in.  I don't care if she talks about me, but talking about my friends (and on top of it all, my BOYFRIEND)?! Whatever. Seriously, people, do something better with your time. Spinning in circles is more productive. Lord.

Keep in mind, not one of us is photogenic, but whatever, here they are anyways.  I still have to get some developed from the end of the year *coughcoughlunchtimecoughcoughcoughcough*.. And when I do, they WILL be posted, despite protests from a few (or one) of my closest friends..  Yes, you know who you are. Hopefully you'll still love me afterwards. ^__~  Check 'em out. Have fun.    ..just not *too* much fun..and make sure it's not at *my* expense.. ^__~
