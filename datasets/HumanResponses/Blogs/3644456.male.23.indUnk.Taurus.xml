      Thoughts about the weekends' happenings in sports:  Ken Griffey Jr. of the Cincinnati Reds FINALLY got homerun #500 versus the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday.  A lot of people have been asking, "Well, should Griffey make the Baseball Hall of Fame?"  I don't even know WHY people are asking the question: of COURSE he should!  Consider the numbers, first:  Only 20 players have ever hit 500 or more homeruns, and now he is one of them.  That's an elite group in my book, especially being the *6th youngest player (age 34) to accomplish the feat.  Griffey was also the youngest to get to 400, which is significant because it proves how much injuries over the last 4 years have really messed up a potential for a HISTORIC career, rather than a great one.  His career numbers, as of now: a .293 career batting average, .562 slugging, a .378 On Base Percentage, with 2143 hits and over 1438 RBI.  He's only 34!  Plus, he WAS the star player of the league in which he dominated (with Seattle) from 1993-1998.  AND he still has a good shot in the next 5-7 years of winning a ring (maybe even this year the way CIN has been playing).  Yeah, I think the guy deserves to be in the Hall.  Fred McGriff on the other hand, has played to long (19 years) and STILL doesn't have #500 (493), his RBI numbers are way too low for his career (1549), and he's just not as had an impact on the game compared to others that got in.  He is however.....  ....ON the hottest team in basbeall, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays!  Can you believe these guys have won 11 in a row?  I didn't even know until this morning that they won YESTERDAY, never mind 11 in a row.  Too bad they play in the toughest division in baseball. They are 32-34 this year and 10/5 games behind the Yankees.  But hey, where else can a fan feel good while saying, "Look, we're ONLY 10.5 games out of 1st place!"  All in all, just be glad that Lou Pinella won't have a heart attack for another 4 days........  Noting that milestone, it also makes me cringe that the Red Sox are now ONLY 6 games above the Devil Rays in the AL East.  I'm not panicking (or at least not trying too), but the Sox usually make a June Swoon each and every single year, especially during interleague play.  I think, if you are a fan, the things you have to focus on the most is that we now have Trot and Nomar back (and they're starting to play better), our pitching is still better than the Yankees (but their offense is WAY superior, kinda the opposite of last year between these 2 teams), and the fact that if you're talking Wild Card, that Texas (a good, young lineup that has average pitching) and Anaheim (a team that was my pick to go to the ALCS earlier in the year, but with all of these nagging injuries around the roster, as well as suspect starting pitching, they'll be lucky to finish 3rd in the tough AL West) are struggling, and with the Minnesota Twins/Chicago White Sox (It's like division 1-AA compared to the other tougher division in baseball) "battling" it out in the AL Central, I think the Sox will be OK.    They just need to make sure they win each series against Minnesota coming up, and the Yankees at the end of the month.  It's a marathon, not a race......  .....finally congrats to South Africa's Retief Goosen on winning his second U.S. Open in Golf on Sunday.  I watched and laughed as Phil Mickelson completely had a brain fart on the final two holes and not only lost the Open, but also the chance for a Grand Slam (winnign ALL FOUR major tourneys - Masters, US Open, British Open, and the PGA Championships).  This guy has blown more big shots than Tera Patrick on a glory hole video.  Good thing he won the Masters last month, otherwise ALL we would be talking about is how much of a choke master he is.  He's still making more money than most people combined, I think he will be fine.  One thing ALL golfers must be happy with: Tiger Woods becoming a non-factor all of a sudden.  After dominating the last few years, he hasn't even been CLOSE to any of the major titles, never mind winning them.  He barely made the cut this time!  Maybe Tiger needs to go back to the Army to train, "Abu-Gharib " style, or maybe have Nike make some super golf shoes or something.  I'll be in Cambridge tonight @ Derek Gerry's Mounting the Hump show at the Cantab Lounge on 738 Mass Ave near the Central Sq T stop.  Show starts @ 8, and is FREE.

      From Friday's Boston Globe:     "Boston is too racist for me,'' he said. "I couldn't play there."    "Only what guys have said," he said, "but that's been going on ever since my dad [Bobby] was playing baseball. I can't play like that. That's not for me, brother."  When it was suggested the racial climate has changed in Boston, Bonds demurred.  "It ain't changing," he said. "It ain't changing nowhere."  They built a tunnel to honor Ted Williams in Boston. What did he imagine would be built for him?  "Nothing, man," he said. "I'm black. They don't build stuff for blacks."  ------------------------------------------------------------  O.K., why does Barry Bonds have to go out of his way to diss my city, huh?  I'm sure if he was confronted on his improper grammer for the use of the wrod, "ain't", he'd probably blame that on "The Man" too.  Does Boston have racist undertones?  Yes.  Even the Red Sox do (The original owner, Tom Yawkey, was from Tennessee and a former plantation owner).  If you ever get a chance, read Boston Herald's columnist Howard Bryant's book, "Shut Out".  Great stuff about how the Sox were the last team in the MLB to have a black player (Yankees were 2nd to last.  You see?  We CAN beat them at something!).  That was also the famed tryout of where Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, and Josh Gibson were on the Fenway grass and someone yelled out, "Get those niggers off the field!"   The city itself has had a shaky history, I'll admit it.  We had the segregation of busing in South Boston during the 70's, the Charles Stewart dibacle, Bill Russell's house getting ransacked in the 'burbs, former Celtic Dee Brown being confused for a bank robber in a Wellesley bank when he was a rookie, and of course Malcolm X calling Boston, "The most racist city in America".    It's still somewhat uncomfortable to minorities.  Ever listen to WJAMN (Jam'n) 94.5?  Yeah, it's a "Hip Hop" radio station not owned or run by black people.  Listen to it someday.  It shows because it sucks.  But the people in Boston arn't THAT bad!  This isn't fucking KKKtown, Arkansas.  For every one racist moment we have had, Anytown, MS has had probably around 20 to match it.  It's not like we're burning crosses on lawns or having different proms for white and black students.  Even black Boston athletes are being recieved more here than they ever have. And they feel more comfortable because of it. Look at Pokey Reese; corn rows n' all, he's by far the most popular player out of all of the new additions this year (AND that's including Schilling and Foulke).  Plus, if Barry had known Boston's history, he would have known that when the first federal census was enumerated in 1790, Massachusetts was the only state in the Union to record NO slaves.  He also said that Boston doesn't build stuff for blacks, where in fact, the African American Meeting house was built by the city in 1805 so blacks could have a church to call home (because they faced minor discrimination in white churches, and that was just by forcing them to the bleacher seats - but hey, at least the city acknowledged they're bigots!)  In addition to its religious and educational activities, the meeting house became a place for celebrations and political and anti-slavery meetings, including a famous speech by Socalist Frederick Douglas.  See, Barry?  We arn't so bad when it comes to racism!  Maybe if you came here and saw for yourself how warm of a city Boston is to minorites (And unlike in New York City, you'll even get a cab from the airport!), you would think twice about what you said.  Plus, we would EVEN build something for your arrival to prove we're not racist AND to make you feel comfortable.....  We'd build a needle.......a BIG GIANT needle.  You'll feel right at home.  Prick.

      DID you see that god awful performance put up by the L.A. Lakers last night?  Phew, for an elimination Game 5 in the NBA Finals, they sure bent over nicely for Detroit like Last Comic Standing's Ant in the U.S. diving team's locker room (Kobe might have to get used to bending over if he gets convicted during this summer).    There are so many questions for the Lakers.  Will Malone retire (Yes)?  Is Shaq coming back (I think he is)?  Where will Kobe be in 5 months (I say he'll be on the Clippers........of the Eagle County Penal League)?    How about Phil Jackson?   Even last night while on the bench, he seemed to be so exhausted from managing so many larger than life egos and diffusing various time bombs for the last 5 years. It’s kind of like my seeing my dad in the backyard when I was young, cleaning his 9 mm while drinking cans of Miller Lite, sitting around fantasizing about when I will finally be out of the house, then looking at me and realizing that I’m coming back for another year.  I always said the one problem with the Lakers coming into this year would be their chemistry.  When you looked at their roster before the season on paper, and then looked at their terrible play last night, no one thought they would ever be saying things after the season like, "Yeah, they picked up a Hall of Famer like Karl Malone, but the Lakers sure will miss Robert Horry." or "I knew the Lakers were done in January when they put 53 year old Horace grant on Injured Reserve."  All kidding aside, at least those guys played together.  They were part of the system, they didn't try to be the star or say anything to disrupt the team's flow.  Even the young talent the Lakers have is promising.  Hell, guys like Kareem Rush and Luke Walton are the types of young talent you want to develop for your future.  Too bad they never got to shoot the ball, as Kobe was hogging it most of the time.  Kobe wasn't even doing what he does best - penitrating to the hole >:-)  I think Kobe and Shaq are done with each other.  They got their rings, had their moment, now it's time to part.  I just wish Reality TV pheomoneon would be the same.  These Lakers remind of you of every dysfuctional family that you see on COPS. Even during the Finals, they were constantly bickering, yelling and blaming each other in front of the police while at the same time incoherently denying that they just finished smoking a crack pipe.  Gary Payton sucked BALLS this whole year; he seriously needs to retire and get back to selling pot like he did in the early 90's.  They don't call him "The Glove", for nothing (cause that's where the weed was in his car).   Hats off to the Pistons, though.  I took a poll on ESPN.COM that asked who was the biggest factor for the Pistons, and i voted for the WHOLE TEAM.  They just played together.  The coach Larry Brown got them to get what he was selling, and they sacrificed individual glory for the ring.  A real great season, a real great defense, and clutch offense........sounds like the Patriots!

      A report out of  urlLink espn.com today says that Ricky Williams would have failed a drug test  if he would has played this year, serving a 4 game suspension (which means he's tested positive twice before).  And check out these pro-pot quotes (FYI, Ricky Williams has&nbsp;had a long bout with depression and was diagonsed with social-anxiety disorder,&nbsp;so he takes Paxil):    "(Marijuana) It's just a plant"       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   ''Marijuana is 10 times better for me than Paxil,'' he said.    From Dolphins head coach, Dave Wannstedt:  "We knew nothing about it," Wannstedt said. "I'm totally surprised and shocked again."  He apparently has actually  urlLink gotten away with smoking weed while on the job for the last two years by drinking a masking agent that fools scientists on urine tests , and forgot to take this masking&nbsp;supplement this year&nbsp;before this year's round of drug&nbsp;tests(How can the Dolphins be suprised this guy smokes pot?&nbsp; Not only is he friends with Lenny Kravitz, he's got dreadlocks and admires the life of Bob Marley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have they ever watched this guy at the lunch line?).&nbsp;&nbsp;   Masking agent that he used to fool the NFL (and ever since his retirement, has given tons of free publicity to)?    "Urine Luck."       &nbsp;   That has to be one of the greatest names for a product, ever!    &nbsp;

      So, Miami Dolphin running back  urlLink Ricky Williams is retired ; I say..............good for him!&nbsp; I totally support him quitting a life of football just so he can spend this fall/winter in the Fuji Islands smoking pot out of his bong.&nbsp; Especially since the fact that he was the best player on a team that plays MY favorite team (Pats), twice a year.  Although the timing is suspect, I again thank Ricky for waiting until Antwoin Smith AND Eddie George were signed on to other teams before he called it quits.  Maybe he is a closeted Pats fan, who knew?  The Red Sox need an outfielder since  urlLink Nixon will most likely be out for a loooooong time .&nbsp; I love Gabe Kapler, he's a good spot guy off the bench with great athletism and of course one hell of a right hand, but&nbsp;you you need someone who is more consistent with his bat, and has been in the playoff spotlight before,&nbsp;even though Kapler's hot right now.&nbsp;   I recommend either  urlLink this guy &nbsp;or ESPECIALLY  urlLink this guy .&nbsp; If FiInley goes to NY, that could mean Johnson is going right with him.  The DNC is here in Boston this week.&nbsp; My dad, who's a Republican&nbsp;cop that's working 24/6.5 (other .5 for sleep) shifts, commented on the chopper noise he's been hearing on his details:  "I hope John Kerry doesn't have any flashbacks about Charlie!"  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      First of all, what&nbsp;a turn-a-round weekend for the Red Sox!&nbsp;   They lose Friday night's game in a fashion that they ALWAYS do: Take the lead early, relenquish it via errors and a bad starting pitching performance by Schilling, then fight back to tie the game in the 8th just to lose it in the 9th under the cut fastball of Mariano Rivera.  This scenario has been happening for about 7 straight years.  Then something happened.&nbsp; Something I've never seen before.  Down 3-0 in Saturday's tilt, Bronson Arroyo (who's pitched better than his record and has more runs unearned than a tourist at a shitty* Mexican hotel) decides to hit Alex Rodriguez in the back with a change-up (which, if you usually want to hit somebody, you do it with a fastball).  *pun INtended  A-Rod tells Arroyo to go, "fuck himself" (Thanks to Tivo for the mountless times I've watched this fight this weekend).&nbsp; Varitek, the catcher,&nbsp;tells him to, "shut the fuck up".&nbsp; A-Rod responds with about 11&nbsp;"fuck you!"'s, and Varitek goes after A-Rod with a bitch slap,&nbsp;and then we got ourselves a brawl!&nbsp; Varitek takes A-Rod to the ground like he's his 11 year old brother, followed by Gabe Kapler absolutely bubbles up Tanyon&nbsp;Sturtze,&nbsp;(who was stupid in being the starting pitcher, going after the most atheltically fit guy on the team) who's now bleeding profusely like he's just gotten himself into a steel cage with Terry Funk.&nbsp; He has to leave the game, and in the process we knock A-Rod out of the game as well with an ejection......  SO, we win the fight........  NOW to win the game, which it looked like they wouldn't.&nbsp; After fighting back to take a 4-3 lead in the 5th, the Sox proceeded to walk about every Yankee hitter in the lineup and then fall down to the tune of 9-4 in the bottom of the inning.  But, this team, for the first time all year, shows some fight!&nbsp; Some spark!&nbsp; They come back to get the game close at 9-8 (followed by Nomar striking out, as usual).&nbsp; The Yankees get a homerun at the bottom of the inning and it goes to 10-8 into the bottom of the ninth.  Then, for the first time in a while, the Sox come back like they did last year.&nbsp; Nomar and Millar each get a hit (a rarity in the same inning), followed by&nbsp;a Bill Mueller walk-off homerun off Rivera in the 9th to take the 11-10 victory!  We win the fight AND the game.&nbsp; That's huge in for a momentum stand point.&nbsp; The Bruins did this 2 years ago, where they beat the shit out of Ottawa (at the time in 1st) on the ice and with their fist, then rolled off 10 straight wins.&nbsp; This is the type of game that CAN change things......if the Sox don't fuck it up.  It was really one of the more enetertaining regular season games, ever, in my history of watching sports.&nbsp; And it was a huge win for a team that needed it.&nbsp; Now they must continue to keep winning through this 12 game road trip to convince me, and the rest of Red Sox nation, NOT to open up the Thursday paper just for the Patriots articles.&nbsp;   Speaking off, good article here on the subject:&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/07/26/sports_crazy

      "The Hit Dog",&nbsp;a.k.a former Red Sox 1B and SUV accident tester Mo Vaughn is now in a lawsuit with former teammate and current&nbsp;Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra over a confidential&nbsp;internet mailing list&nbsp;that that was alledgedly stolen by Vaughn's former agent which was&nbsp;used to solicit&nbsp;clients for Nomar's hitting clinic.&nbsp; (Story here:  urlLink http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/07/21/the_hit_dog_harmony_ends_in_court_filing ).  Apparently, everytime someone would open up the Nomar emails, they would get a huge amount of pop-ups.  &nbsp;

       Rave : Gabe Kapler filling in for a "hobbled" Manny Ramirez during the last few games versus Anaheim.&nbsp; I've always liked Gabe for the athletism and occasional hot bat he brings to the team.&nbsp; He's the type of guy the Sox usually don't have; they alwaysd go for the "slow yet has homerun power" guys like Burks and Millar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's hope he continues his good play in Seattle. &nbsp;  Rant : Manny Ramirez's Hamstring.&nbsp; Is it bothering him?&nbsp; Is it a hoax?&nbsp; He is a robot like Dick Cheney?&nbsp; I really don't care, I just want the guy heathly enough for the Yankee series.&nbsp; He's so valuable, yet he at times can be SO frustrating with his often puzzled behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;Francoma ain't helping the situation.&nbsp; The type of guy Freud would have a ball with. &nbsp;  Rant N' Rave :&nbsp; David Ortiz.&nbsp; WHAT IN THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING!&nbsp;&nbsp; His good play over the weekend too just demonstrates&nbsp;how much the Red Sox need him, and why it was so unnessicary to throw 2 bats at umpires on the field after being ejected during Friday's 4-2 win.&nbsp; I'll say he will get a 5-7 game suspension.......but the appeal will last long enough that he&nbsp;will make at least 2 out of the 3 Yankee series this weekend. &nbsp;  Rant :&nbsp; Pedro, you're a funny guy.&nbsp; We love how you clown around in the dugout during wins.&nbsp; But during a blowout loss?&nbsp; Dude, you just need to chill and be a bit more professional.&nbsp; Or take some Ritalin. &nbsp;  Rave: &nbsp; A split in Anaheim over the Angels, very key.&nbsp; The Angels will come on during the enxt few weeks, so it was important the Sox came out even.&nbsp;&nbsp;They SHOULD take 2 games in Seattle this week, even without Manny.&nbsp; Seattle SUCKS. &nbsp;  Rant :&nbsp; Why haven't the Sox put in a claim on John Olerud yet?&nbsp; I like Dave McCarty, but Olerud is an excellent 1B who hits for average and is a seasoned veteran.&nbsp; He has had a subpar season with Seattle only because that team is older that the Bible.&nbsp; He might go under retirement, but still - the Sox need a guy like him on the team for the stretch run. &nbsp;  Rave : I don't know about you, but I would do a Shoppach, Alvarez,&nbsp;&amp; Nixon deal for Houston's Carlos Beltran ANY second.&nbsp; Love ya, Trot, but Carlos Beltran is a young star, and you're will always be an above average player who, in my mind, is damaged goods at this point. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Great job by David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez reppin' the Sox last night with 2 2 run HRs a piece in the AL's 9-4 romp over the NL.  A lot of people say they should of been co-MVPs, but Alfonso Soriano's 3 run shot really set a tone and put the game out of reach.  Plus, it was a HUGE blast over the rightfield wall in Houston.  I am so glad that guy doesn't play for the Yankees anymore......he's actually developed patience over the plate, which is scary.  Bud Selig wants the "The winning league gets the home field in the World Series" thing renewed.  Of course he does, because he's stupid.  Not only does it devalue a win/loss record for the regular season, it also pins a square advantage to someone in a championship series via an EXHIBITION game!  That's like giving someone the White House just because he only won the state of Florida........  Going into Stage 10 today, Lance Armstrong is in real danger of losing the Tour de France for the first time in 5 years.  I've always found it ironic that in France's biggest race (a country known for surrendering and pissing on people), the leader and winner of the race gets a yellow shirt.  I don't know why everyone outside of the USA is in a tussle over Lance's alleged doping.  The guy had testicular cancer!  I think he's allowed to take steroids after getting a nut cut off!  If there's ANYTHING that critics should go after, it should be the fact that Lance has a huge speed advantage by being 2-3 lbs lighter for only having that one nut.  The critics sure dropped the  ball  on that one (ok, I'll stop).......  I hope Randy Johnson does come to the Red Sox, not only to help them win a World Series, but maybe he can put a huge dent into this over population of pidgeons we have in this city.  We used to have a big rat problem around here, but it got taken care of because those rats evoled and grew wings.  When you see 4 albino pidgeons having breakfast at *2* different Dunkin Donuts', they're fucking too much.  Pidgeons are the one of the many reason's the NRA could be a fun club to be in.  It would be like duck hunt, except the dog would be replaced with a cat.......armed with lasers.     Big series coming up in Anaheim this week.  And they need to win more than we do so they can look more attractive to the "Big Unit".  Speaking of being attractive to units, a sex video shot by a former husband of Baywatch blonde beauty Gena Lee Nolin (warning!  not work friendly! http://www.anothersite.co.uk/gena-lee-nolin.htm ) is out.  I was very impressed because it's her best acting performance she's had since.........wait, she could never act in the first place.  But she sure can play it up for the camera!  Now THERE'S talent!   Gena.....Hey now, you're an All Star!

      Well, it's baseball's all star break, and we're 86 games through the season.  The Sox stand at a decent 48-38 clip, a game ahead of the wild card over Oakland and 7 games behind the Yankees, who I still think arn't that good.   Who would have guessed that the Sox AND Cubs would be 7 games behind in their perspective divisions?  These teams have so much talent before the season, that's like saying that Jimmy Fallon AND Nicole Richie will get Oscars by the end of the decade.  I was at the game yesterday, still pretty bummed how they lost.  Those umpires SUCKED, they had a major case of, "We want to go home-itis".    At least my DAG % (Drunkness At Games percentage) is still at 1.000.  Jesus HAS reincarnated himself as Johnny Damon (for now).  I mean, look at the similaries!  The hair, the closeness of the initals (JC, JD), and the many miracle plays over the past 8 games.  Now if he can only turn the warm Bud Light drafts at games into GOOD beer.......  Roger Clemens to the Red Sox, right?  Sounds good and look good right?  *SMACK*!  It's never going to happen......  Randy Johnson MIGHT still go to NY.......but odds are he'll go to Anaheim (if they play well in the next 12 games).  The Red Sox in my baseball season on EA's MVP BASEBALL 2004 are 60-26.  I'm the man, and so is Nomar, who in my season, is hitting .354 with 34 HRs and 70 RBI with a .400 OBP.  Barry Bonds is hitting .415!  NCAA Football 2005 comes out July 15th.  Madden 2005 comes out 2 weeks later.  Two MORE reasons why I don't need a girlfriend........  Sitting in the bleachers yesterday drunk off my ass looking at cute girls in skimpy Red Sox clothing the ONLY reason to have a girlfriend......  Shaq to the Heat?  That's OK, ain't like the Celtics are going to win the division for the next 10 years, anyways.  A show at the Cantab Lounge today on 738 Mass Ave near Central Sq on the Red Line.

      Hey folks, sorry I haven't been posting for a while, but it's been a busy week for me with the July 4th holiday, a great end to the fiscal year at my job (which came with a nice bonus at around 4 figures), fishing in Falmouth, playing poker, and of course, the drunken 6 day therapy binge I have gone through with the Red Sox over the last week.  I haven't wrote anything basically because I was physically zapped by watching all 6 of these last games versus Atlanta and New York.  If it wasn't for Curt Schilling, I would probably done a Charles Stewart and jumped into the Charles River right now.  That's how frustrating it is, and it's only the beginning of July.  As many in the nation (including the Reverend Tim about to hang himself) have witnessed over this past horrible week, one has to conclude and ask:  Do the Red Sox actually have a chance to be, agasp, competitve this year?  They're now 3 games over the Devil Rays (I can't believe I just wrote that) and pretty much heading into a (they have to at least win 4 out of the next 6) big homestand versus AL West and Wild Card contenders Texas and Oakland.  They are currently 9 games behind the NY Yankees, and unless a collapse by NY happens in the last 81 games (which could happen, as bad as the Sox are playing now, NY has serious issues with it's starting pitching and just got over a sweep by the rival NY Mets), the Sox will have to be thinking Wild Card....again.  wITH THE STRUGGLES AND STEADY DECLINE, HOWEVER, ONE NOW HAS TO CONSIDER - DO WE BECOME SELLERS AT THE TRADING DEALINE?  a) Nomar sitting on the bench during the 13 inning debacle still gives me fits (and for once, you could argue that Nomar should have stuck it out for at least one inning so Crespo should have been in the game over Millar in rightfield, so that Cairo ball doesn't turn into a double).  Nomar is also not the .330/30/110 guy he used to be.  And he's a free agent who's already rejected a 4 YEAR 60 MILLION dollar deal (wha?).   He's going to the Dogdgers....so why not get Cesar Izturis and Odalis Perez in return?  b) Derek Lowe pretty much psyched himself out of any type of talent since rejecting his 3 year, 27 million dollar deal and putting tons of pressure on himself to pitch well in his contract year.  Oh well, Derek; have fun going out in the free market: "Will Walk for Free Food".  Too bad he's pitching so bad they are talking about putting him BACK in the bullpen.  He needs a psychiatrist like I need to get laid.  c) And Kevin Millar, who suprises me every time he's on the field, because his career died about a year ago after hitting .220 in the last half of 2003.  He just dyed his hair blond too.  Hey Kevin....BOY BAND UP!    Plus, why is HE the KFC spokeperson?  He sucks!  People will REJECT KFC now that he's promoting it. I think Pokey Reese would be a much better choice.  SO, if this team doesn't get on a streak, and soon, these guys will be the first to go.  And I think a deal should be made reguardless because this team needs a change.  It's too comfortable.  And too poisitive, thanks to "I won't sacrifice" Zen Master and Moby look-alike Terry Francona.  Thanks to the Moneyball/Murphy's law "defensive errors happen" theory, the Red Sox now make more errors than the Bush Administration.  Terry's a nice guy, but he's not a good manager.  Aargh!!!!  I told everyone they should have hired Bobby Valentine!  They're are some good things about this year that make you still have hope.  There are the Sox All Stars in Schilling, Ortiz, and Manny.  And Pedro has been real optimistic in his quotes over the last few days.  When things usually went this bad in the past, he usually uses the "my 5th grandmother got sick" excuse and goes into seclusion into the Dominican Republic for 7 days.    And they are always the Patriots.  One movie that made me feel good about all of this that I saw today was, "Major League".  You take away a few things from the movie: like the fact that Cleveland sucks, Charlie Sheen is a great method pitcher, the mystery of Corbin Bernsen's career, and that Pedro Serrano, despite hot being able to hit a curveball and worshipping the peagan god, Jobu, will still eventually become the President of the United States someday.    The main goal of the movie, though, is that it basically reminds fans that if you keep the faith, you'll eventually get a winner.  I say to Sox fans, just look at the bright side in that they are still 81 games left this year, and thank god for the Wild Card and 4th place!    As Jack Byrne says in the movie, "We're somehow still in this thing".

      Here are some news and notes in the world o' sports:   Out of Red Sox injury report : Reports  urlLink have claimed that reliever Scott Williamson's right forearm  has swelled to twice the size of a normal forearm. Why is this a problem? After all, it never seemed to keep Popeye out of the bullpen; just give him less spinach, he'll be fine.   Notes from last night :   urlLink Tampa Bay left fielder Robert Fick's  last name means "fuck" in German. That gives him the most obscene name in the majors since the retirement of   urlLink Rusty Kuntz (not making this up)  .   Soccer : The French National Soccer team has recently named Richard Fucka to their Olympic squad.   Dick Fucka will be a key role player off the bench, as he will provide distraction in laughter from the other team everytime he turns his back.   Football News :  Since retiring because he failed a pot test, Ricky Williams is now in the process of chasing a film career.  Since he, and follow running back and Raven's star Jamal Lewis (who's on trial for laundering money and cocaine trafficking) will have plenty of time on their hands, they are now in the process of filming the comedy,   "Ricky and Jamal Go to White Castle".    If Jamal can get to the set, expect to see this movie in about 20 years to life.   Basketball :  Former Los Angeles Laker Rick Fox is divorcing wife Vanessa Williams (Vanessa Williams!), citing irreconicible differences and potential infidelity by Fox.  Apparently, Vanessa (Vanessa Williams!) is not quite good enough for his L.A. acting lifestyle. (Vanessa fucking Williams!) Too bad he's heading back to Boston in a trade that happened last week.   Remember Boston, Rick?  I live here now; good luck finding L.A.-quality hotties.   You'll still get laid for who you are, because most Boston women are tools, but you won't find any L.A. quality hotties.   Basketball :  Rick Fox has now reitred at the age of 35 after comedian Sean Caulfield reminded him of how much Boston is a sausage fest and why the female dating pool here mostly sucks.   Sports business :   urlLink Madden NFL 2005  for all videogame entertainment systems comes out today in select locations.  On a personal level, I am psyched because I had Terrell Owens and Corey Dillon traded to their new teams in the 2004 Madden franchises before they actually were.  By the way, I haven't had a girlfriend in over 4 years.  See bitterness above.   Olympics :  Yeah, I couldn't make any jokes about it, either.   Girls are hot, though.

      So Nomar is gone as we all know, and I say, good for him, and good for the Red Sox.   He wasn't going to stay, and he was acting like a bitch the last few weeks because he wasn't getting any attention, and he wanted to be healthy for free agency.   "I called him in his hotel room just to wish him luck and thank him for all he did for the franchise," Sox CEO Larry Lucchino said last night. "Then I asked him, 'How's the heel?' He said, 'It's great.'" "(I said,) 'Great? How can it be great? Two days ago, you thought you were going to have to go on the DL.' He said, 'Yeah, well, it's great now.'"  Sox sources even alleged that Garciaparra said that he wanted to make sure he was healthy at the end of the season, when he would have to take a  November physical  as part of the free agent process.    The Sox (and new ownership) weren't going to resign him, and were offended when he rejected a 4yr/15m dollar contract last year.  So, pressured to make a deal, Theo though we might as well get some players out of this before he leaves for free (Cabrera isn't a bad player, and that play last night wasn't his fault - that's Terry's for not telling him the correct relay position.  It's ALSO terry's fault that Pedro wasn;t in the game in the 8th inning.)  Nomar was being a cancer in the clubhouse, despite the fact the guy DOES play as hard as he can while in there (and produces with stats).  But the other players were tired with the, "woe is me" bullshit, and Nomar was tired of the daily soap opera that is Boston Red Sox Nation.  The problem with Nomar, as we are now finding out, is intangibles.  You never know what to get with Nomar (see: sitting out 13 inning games versus Yankees this year), even though statistically (and even physical talent wise) he has the greater past.  Remember when Sox and Yankee fans used to debate whether Jeter or Nomar was better?  Well, the debate is similar to "Who's career will be better? Michael Jackson and Prince?"    Michael Jackson, early in his career, was a young and hot talent.  A young prospect with great dancing talent from the Jackson 5, he came out solo and was winning awards.  He carried on his family's tradition.  He was the face of pop music, making millions..............  All in while Prince just kept the consistency turning out hit after hit, being original and gaining a fan base, making a movie, and maybe not outselling Jackson, but doing enough to be a force. He was making money and being a big player in music.   Then, MJ fell off the face of the earth when he became a white pedo pop queen; while Prince became a Jehovah's witness and STILL continues to make good, solid albums that quietly get the job done on the charts.  He OUTLASTED him.  As Chris Rock said, "In the end.....dat nigga Prince won!"  Quietly, with a little flair, and consistency.......that's Derek Jeter.  Just like Prince, you know he's going to come around again and again and never disappoint, especially in the clutch.  He was never GREAT in terms of stats (or album sales or in dancing talent when comparing Prince to MJ) but you know what you're getting with him: a true leader and gamer who'll play every game with blood and sweat all while batting .310 with 15-20 HR and 80-90 RBI,  and a .400+ OBP with over 100 runs scored; and of course......banging hotter chicks (which is true in BOTH cases).  Nomar?  Once a much better player in the field and on the plate, his numbers have decreased over the years.  He can't play everyday (Orlando Cabrera, can) .  His defense isn't what it used to be.  His heel, ankle, and wrist are a concern.  A 2 time batting champ and once hitting .325 with 30/100+, now he's about as good as Jose Valentin with a little better batting average.  Oh, and his OBP STINKS (partly due to his philosophy at the plate, but every time Nomar popped up I wanted to kick MYSELF in the nuts).  I think that's why we had to give the Cubs an extra prospect.....because THEY knew what the risks where in getting this guy.  He's a head case (just look at him in the plate).  He was the most paranoid player in Boston sports history; the media gave him good press, and the fans (esp. kids) loved him, and he still thought everyone was out to get him as if he was Alex Jones at a Republican dinner.  Like Drew Bledsoe, it was time to go.  Time will tell if Nomar will take a page ad in both the Herald and Globe to at the least, thank the fans of Boston who loved him and remembered the GREAT times (1997-2000), even when frustrated (this one included).  He needed a change, and so did we.  We gave up a great shortstop, but we got depth, defense, and some intangibles back (Doug Mient....whatever his name is a good friend of David Ortiz, and is a leader.)  Only time will tell in wins and losses (and where Nomar goes next) whether how things will play out.
