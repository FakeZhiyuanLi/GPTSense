       A--- and I just had our 55th "discussion" about us. He doesn't seem to understand where I'm coming from, or his own emotions. He listed off 8 things he would like to do with me in the next month (including taking me shopping for lingerie, seeing movies, and giving me orgasms). I then asked him, if I said ok, could he actually do those things. He said, "I would definitely try, but sepember is very busy. I don't want you to have high expectations, or even medium." Dear God!  The more I know him, the more I realize he is just wired differently than everyone else. To him, the thing that matters is that he wants to do those things--and I should feel totally given to and loved because he wants to do them. To me, all I see are empty promises and someone who says "You can't depend on me. Don't depend on me."  I told him to contact me if and when he is at a place where I CAN depend on him to do the things he promises.  I think Erik's post, that said I am caught between the desire for him to be the person I want and my physical desire--that is what is going on. Although in my defense, I am pretty much emotionally disconnected from A. at this point. Except he drives me crazy!!! I think IM is the worst thing that ever happened! (Alas, it works well for real work stuff.)  I watched the Olympics last night. Did anyone see that truly anorexic gymnast from Russia? Svetlana, perhaps? Oh my, I felt like I was watching a walking skeleton. I was surprised she didn't keel over from lack of energy.

       I went out to lunch with A--- yesterday. All my negative feelings seem to have resolved themselves, because we had a lot of fun. He would love to maintain our "relationship" but we actually didn't talk about that. He had a hard time not touching me--constantly just brushing my hand or my knee or grabbing my arm.  He seemed a lot more normal than he did when I was so upset. Hmmmm. I project my feelings as much as everyone else, I guess. Too bad he can't get it together and tolerate time with someone.  I'm still very physically attracted to him. Whatever he has that appeals to me, it sure appeals.

       So the topic that dominates my mind (this is so stereotypically woman) is romantic relationships. It's the one thing that I think I am worst at doing well. Lately I have been on a terrible streak. I'm 34, a single heterosexual woman, never married, and I haven't been in a long relationship since college.  Although I have had a few positive relationships, the two men I have "hung out with" in the past year have been terrible for me. I'm sure they are nice enough men on their own, but they were bad matches.  The most recent was A-----. A is a 34 year old male who I met on the second week of my new job (I work as a human resources analyst doing HR systems).  He captured my attention because he seemed smart and witty, although he clearly had some ADD. We started chatting online (our work has an in-house IM function); he works across the building from me, so it's actually fairly meaningless that we work together.  A began revealing inappropriate info to me right away--within 24 hours of starting to talk, he had referenced his sexual proclivities and apparatus, told me all about his prior wife and girlfriends, etc. etc. We began going to lunch regularly, and at the end of the first week, we went out for drinks after work.  Part of my brain kept saying, "this will never work, this is crazy." Another part of me really liked the attention and that pheremonal attraction. I was more physically attracted to this guy than I have been to anyone, ever--he's not that attractive, per se, but it was the right combination of body, personality, smells, whatever.  It turned out that A has almost no time in his life, but worse, that he needs large blocks of time to himself to feel okay. He admitted he needed 3-4 hours alone every day to feel okay. So his priorities of work, time alone, and some side work he did as a photographer used up all his time. Over the three months we hung out, we only met outside of work 2 times. Our "relationship" consisted of this: hours of IMing during work and sometimes at night at home; a couple lunches during the week together (although this tapered off dramatically after the first few weeks); once a week or so, making out in the backseat of his car for 45 minutes after work (ouch! painful to write); phone calls 2-3 times per week. Plus two hours of drinks the first week we met (mentioned above), and 3 hours at my house one time about 8 weeks after we met. He also took me out to a nice lunch on my birthday. Those were our 3 "dates."  Now I don't think many rational people would call this a relationship. I got very emotionally wrapped up in it, however, because we were spending so much time IMing. Worse, he was pushing my emotional buttons in a big way, because he was promising so much. He would talk as if marriage was in our future, but then he couldn't make time to see me. I railed and railed against him about his--I told him he was being a huge tease for being so emotionally intimate on a verbal level when he couldn't put any time or companionship in on an actual level.  Lest you think this was all one-sided, a little game I was playing in my own mind, let me tell you: he was telling me he loved me, that he wanted to take care of me, that I was the most amazing woman he had ever met, that he wanted me to move in with him. He wanted to be my gardener, and I was the garden. His own words!  It was just so confusing, so troubling, so hurtful--here was a man I was attracted to, who spent hours upon hours talking to me via IM, who professed love and adoration. But he couldn't spend any time with me. And he couldn't see that this was a contradiction, a problem. He thought I couldn't accept his love, and I was creating difficulties so that I didn't have to accept the love of a "healthy" man.  Anyway, I tried to cut it off multiple times, but he would just ignore that and continue as is. Finally, I laid it down that I didn't want him to talk to me about anything sexual or romantic, and I stopped logging on to the IM function at work. This seems to have finally stopped him. But I was so mad at him for so long. It felt like he was holding out a platter of love and then always yanking it back when I walked toward him.  There are other details here, painful to admit. I'll stop here--if you want to know more, tell me.  And remember, all analysis is fair game!

       Here's my idea: what if I tell you all about my life, and I invite you (whoever you are) to analyze me? I was googling the words "analyze me," hoping for some amazing web tool where you popped in a few of your personality quirks and the tool spit out a spot-on personality analysis--complete with potential solutions. Hah! Obviously, it wasn't there. But it led me to this thought: what if there was a blogging community that invited others to read and analyze the writer?  So, here's the official invitation: PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR ANALYSIS AND FEEDBACK. You can comment on any aspect of my psychology or life. You can project your own issues on me (a little counter-transference, anyone?). Use me, my words, my life, as a mystery for you to solve. Pretend I am a film, or a client on the couch, or a mystery novel, or your own weird dream in which you happened to be naked in high school--analyze at will.  Really, it seems to me that this is how many of us relate to other people anyway--by analyzing them consciously or unconsciously. So why not make the process explicit?
