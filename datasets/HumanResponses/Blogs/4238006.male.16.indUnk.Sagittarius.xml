      School is back in YAY!!! Well my week was pretty uninventful. I went Bowling on Friday and I also went to a Chruch Lockin. It was pretty fun, we played Mafia and a game called Underground Chruch. It's relly hard for me to explain in typing, but trust me when i say it's like hide and go seak on crack...it's a sweet game. Well thats about all I got now, i'll try to do something more interresting later on in this week.

      * Beware this is a long post*   Well I guess not that I have yet to get any sleep I'll go ahead and tell you guys about my adventures on Wensday through Friday. Ok it all started out with my friend Andrew calling and telling me that there was a Halo party at my other friend Tom's house (we do this ever so ofter, this was different because we had 2 X-Boxes). Well after a few hours went bye I called my other friend whow as going Nathan and asked what the hold up was. It seems my friend can't count and doesn't know the difference between 10 and 7. Well at about 10 or 9:30 after Nathan called this other guy i know who i guess i could call a friend now Walter comes and picks me up. It takes some time but we make it to Tom's house, and on the way invite another friend Wyatt. We get to the house to relize that 1.) we have the wrong A.V. cables and 2.) Microsoft has to squeeze every penny out of you they can so we need to get a X-Box ethernet cable. Well this takes us to a closed Big-K mart, and a Super Wallmart...and as you can guess, the Super Wallmart doesn't have the freaking cord we need. Well we call Wyatt, or he calls us...I can't remember, and we decide to meet them at the Wallmart because it's closer to them. As we wait we (Nathan, Tom, and I) decide to get some food while Walter plays Deer Hunter. We end up stocking up with a box of 120 pizza rolls for like 9 bucks, 4 pizza's that are $.98 a peice, 2 sodas that are 2 for $1 and a pack of swiss rolls that are $1.09...yeah we were loaded. So we end up meetin Wyatt and Andrew...and it's about 11 or so at this point in time. And we go off on our way back to Tom's house with our newly aquired food. We start playing X-Box for a while and we play some Super Smash Brothers Melee. After this Nathan, Tom, and I start to prepare our food, when suddenly the bejesus is scared out of us by Casey, Heather, and Luran (yes more friends). We at first think we mass hullicinated and tell Andrew, Walter, and Wyatt what we saw. We then get a call saying that they want to meet us at a bowling alley...we at first decline, but a few of us put up a fight and it is decided that we go...oh and it is 1 am now. Well, we get outside and notice that Walter's car has been wrapped with plastic wrap...and as we then find out they put crisco inside the door handles. At this point we're pumped...except Tom who has decided to go to sleep (lightweight)...and decide to plan a counter attack. For this talk we get 1.) Flour 2.) Soap 3.) A Super Soaker (anti-personale) 4.) Eggs. Well we decide that we are going to flower the bejesus out of their cars and make it stick with the liquid soap we have...the eggs serve no use in the first attack and we end up buying more. Back to the present, we figure out that they are at a Waffle House and meet them there before we go to the bowling alley, we play it cool and act as if nothing had happened...and we notice their insecurity. We both go together to get gas and after Walter refules his car they decide to go back to the house at which they are staying and switch cars. Wyatt then come up with a brilliant plan of going to the house, waiting for them to leave and striking at the cars that are left over. This is facilitated by Andrew getting us balls lost around their neighborhood, how does this work out you say?? Well as we finally know where we are going we see their newly aquired car turn out onto the road we're using. We immedantly pull over and turn our lights off. What then follows is a tatical strike that totally demolished their cars. They are covered in flour and soap, not to mention pizza (i forgot to mention we brought a pizza with us) which was stuffed under the door handles. We go bowling and from what I gather they struck at us in the parking lot taking a 2/3 stance...oh and they still at this point have no idea what we've done. They get us good though when we get back to Tom's they pelt us with water balloons...very inaccuratly though. This all takes place bewteen 1 and 6 in the morning. The next night is proceded by another ninja esque strike where Walter and I meet with them to discuss the rules. We have our firends Maggie, Paul, and Wyatt bail and we use a cover story of them getting lost and we need to go look for them. What then happens is us taking them around the building and having to dart for Walters car due to our perfectly mastered strike, the retelation the plan is ineffectual when we manage to bipass the crappy road block they have created, pick up the crew and move back to the foward base (Nathan's house tonight)...oh the strike was a flowering and us using the window markers you see on car windows to write I think it was Cunt all over their car. As it so happens Walter leaves at 3 in the morning thus they have no car to strike at...but as it seems they manage to hit Maggie's car by writing explatives over her car. I'm not sure if the war was continued on Friday...but I don't think it was. All in all I would like to conclude that we won the major battles and our percision got us the war...but if nothing else we tied. It was a fair fight and one I think would be fun to continue later on.

      Well, I've finally done it....I have a blog. I though I'd get one so I could write down all the remenial tasks I do a day, cause I know everyone is interrested in my sweet ass life. I like the name, but I'm suprised it wasn't taken...like everything else I tried to choose for my screen name and web adress. I'll leave all you people out there to figure it's reference out...and once I get to it.. and if I can figure it out I'll try to post the random pictures I've taken out of boredom. I'm sure if you've come here you have my AIM screen name...as it's the only refuge for the link, but if you don't my moniker is Killerfurball. Ok for those of you who know nothing about me my real name is Michael and I live in Nashville, TN...please no hick jokes. I like a lot of different forms of music...such as Rock, Rap, some Techno, and....thats it really. Oh I have a complete distaste for Country music. I like video games, they are a good drain of my time, and I find them very entertaining, especially the RPG's, anything with an emersive story can usually pull me in....though I never realy liked the FF series. Ok well to the actual reason I created this blog....I like to write...even though I have yet to write 4 AP US History essays due in...well...1 day. I have a few links everyone need to check out (I'll have even more once my friend gets on AIM and I can copy and paste them to this) www.seizurerobots.com oh, please don't go to that if your an epileptic...I don't want anyone having a seizure  urlLink www.lowwatermusic.com  I like this band...they have 3 mp3's for download on their site and 3 videoes. Just because I know everyone is dieing to know what I am doing at this ungodly hour...I seem to be watching a Snoop Dogg video on MTV2, I think I might just switch it back to Old School though...thats a good movie, I suggest everyone go see AVP...on the premsis that it's Aliens vs Preaditor...I mean that alone warrents a good movie (pfft), actually it wasn't as bad as I though it was going to be...least it wasn't Van Helsing, god I can't believe I paid 8 bucks to see that movie. Well, I guess I'll post more stuff in this blog later today...I'm going to allow comments but please guys/gals keep it down.
