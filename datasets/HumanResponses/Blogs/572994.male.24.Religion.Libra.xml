      i had a very eventful weekend. my wife and i are buying a house. it is a process that God will walk, neigh, crawl us through to the end. so much to do and wait for and learn and blah, blah. but we are very very excited. this is the woman that i want to spend my whole life with and we will move into our first house together soon. it's cool, you should see it. things are interesting. i am letting the devil have a lot of control over my thoughts, and then i read in Romans that there is no condemnation awaiting those in Jesus. the law was made weak by the sinful nature of man, but made holy by Jesus coming and dying after living a perfect life. i am free. i have to exercise that liberty in a responsible way. i pray that this week will bring me into a place of clear and holy thinking, so that God will be glorified with my life. brother willy is awesome, God is huge. good night.

      this week has been a drag. i feel so empty and tired and thirsty. i don't have any fellowship in a church up here. i miss that. i need that. i need worship. this is good and i am glad i am doing it habitually, but i need to express worship more. i need to stop whining that is what i need to do. i am focusing on a Bible study by the wonderful Louis Giglio tonight...   come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! come buy wine and milk without money and without cost. - Isaiah 55:1   wow, what a thought. we were hardwired to desire the company of God. He created us for Him, and we seek to fill thta desire our whole life, when God is right there all along. He just wants us to find peace in Him. peace in Him, that is tough sometimes, at least for me. i like to organize my face off. i need control, and it is difficult for me to surrender all of that to God. pray for me in that way.   ...my chosen, the people I formed for Myself that they may proclaim my praise - Isaiah 43:20-21   God has hardwired us to desire him and to proclaim His praise, this is the longing we all feel. we seek refuge and it is found in the name of Christ Jesus. He doesn't need us to worship, as the rocks will cry out if we don't, but we are created for that very purpose. Awesome. because God is eternal, our hunger is such that it cannot be satisfied with temporary things. Our appetite will not be satisfied on this earth by earthly things.  in the search for satisfaction we seek and dig our own wells that run dry very quickly. God is an eternal stream of living water that will never run out. find peace in that thought brothers and sisters! So many scripture references in Jerimiah and James about drawing near to God and finding that we were created for Him. that is the answer to the question. find rest and peace in the eternal stream. drink from the living well. good stuff man.

      recently, i had someone ask me if i always had turned to God (in terms of over time). well, the answer to that isn't as simple as it should be. i always knew about God. i was brought into the Lord's company as a small child. in retrospect (looking at my life over the years) i know that God had me then as He has me even now. i just didn't pursue Him like i should've. i am glad that i was asked that question. no i have not always turned to God, but He has always been right there anyway.  yesterday i ogt up early and felt pretty good about doing my Bible study in the morning as opposed to at night. the truth is i woke up because i had a bad dream. probobly the worst dream a man that loves a woman can dream, and after nearly squeezing the life out of wife after waking up (and waking her up which was not so good an idea), i sought refuge in the Word. i do the same now. i am feeling like i am slowly drifting back into the doomloop that has been my walk over the last four years. i want God and all of His love and affection, but i know that even if i do not feel that, i carry on in obedience. "as i walk through the wilderness, blessed be Your name"    are you so foolish? after beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort? - Galatians 3:3   chapter 3 of Galatians focuses on the church's attempts to receive the Spirit by obeying the law. it is only to believe. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law...   ...cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree. - Galatians 3:13   He even took on the curse of the law so that we could be blessed as Abraham was. Christ took all of this on because God wanted to be intimate with us. He missed us. He made the first move. He died a sinner's death after living a perfect life, so now we act on that blessing. HE MADE THE FIRST MOVE. grace is freedom from the law. We respect the law, and we obey it for the reason of having God glorified through our works, but our relationship with Him and our salvation comes from Christ and Christ alone. His wounds healed us. each lash of the whip was for our iniquity. that is love, i want to be intimate with that God, Jesus is King of the World and I submit to His perfect will.    This world has nothing for me, and this world has everything - Caedmon's Call

      it has been too long. God will allow you to rationalize your way out of anything. "i'm too tired", "well i was at a Christian music festival all night", or "i have done it every other night". i decided to get up early and do it this morning to start my week. i need God. the sermon yesterday was amazing. it was all about intimacy with God and how badly He wants that with us. i feel led to read in galatians...  galatians is known by some as the "magna carta" of Christian liberty. it was martin luther's favorite letter, and he frequently preached from it during the time of the reformation.   ...if i were still trying to please men, i would not be a servant of Christ - Galatians 1:10   my purpose on this earth is not to please man. it is not to acquire things or impress anyone. it is simply this; to love God with all my heart and to love others. know God and make Him known.   chapter 1 verse 11 is so important,  ...the gospel that i preached is not something that man made up.  paul actually received the words as a direct revelation of God. he goes on to discuss his past and how God called him out of persecuting the church. it is so important to paul for us to believe that he is telling the truth that he assures us before God that he isn't lying.  as is evidenced in chapter 2 verse 10, peter had a primary interest in serving the poor. this is something that we should always remember. i know ,this is just a side note, i won't preach on politics (not today).   know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. so we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law, no one will be justified - Galatians 2:16   in the verse above, paul is scolding peter for comprimising in the face of persecution. the "judaizers" had come to teach that all Jews, even Christian Jews, must be justified by living under sacred Jewish law. peter was afraid of these people and kind of backed away when they were around. paul states, in verse 21, that if we could be justified by the law, Christ died for nothing and the cross is worthless. i don't believe that, do you?

      that is an appropriate title. when i hit my knees to pray a few minutes ago, God gave me peace almost immediately. the Christian faith is not one that is built on "feelings" or "emotions", however, those are tools that God has hardwired into our beings. for me, as a human, it is important to my intellectual and emotional security to feel at peace, and that is what God did for me last night after a long day, and tonight once again. i think that it would be appropriate for me to seek Him in the morning as well. to start my day with that peace, would lead to less requirement, on my part, for that blessing again at the end of the day. good thing God doesn't keep score like that.   dear friends, do not be suprised at the painful trial you are suffering...rejoice that you share in the sufferings of Christ so that you may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed - 1 Peter 4:12-13   everytime Christ reveals Himself to me in some small way, i rejoice. i truly do. the last week has been a roller coaster. it is probobly nothing compared to what lies ahead, but imagine when God's glory is fully revealed. oh, what a time! i think that i need to do something to make more of a stand at work. i mean, should i seek to be insulted for my faith? maybe just make it more evident that i am more than just a "very nice boy" who just so happens to look awesome in khaki's, but i digress. i pray that God would give me an opening to discuss church or my faith with someone tomorrow at work. i am so faithful that God is going to do that. man, He's cool.   humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that He may lift you up in due time. cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you. be self-controlled and alert your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. resist him, standing firm in the faith - 1 Peter 5:6-9   this redirected me to Phillipians 4:6-7 which implores Christians to cast their worries at His feet, and pray, so that Jesus can guard our hearts. this devotion feels kind of like an episode of sienfeld right now, there are a number things going on that are tying together in my mind right now. 1 Peter 5 is about the roles within the church; young, be humble and pray; old, be eager examples. throughout all of this, God is right there for you to pray to and He is faithful to guard your heart against the arrows of the devil. man, i can beat the devil. God already has.

       whoever serves me must follow me; and where i am, my servant also will be. my father will honor the one who serves me - John 12:26   are you God's servant? if so, are you where He is? do you follow Him. He doesn't follow you, you follow Him. the moral character of the people of this earth is going to continue to decline, unless our hearts are HUMBLED before God and we are where He is. God is great. God is love. how do we get where He is? PRAY. SEEK HIM DAILY, NIGHTLY, WITHOUT CEASING. this is how we seek God, then we find Him in His word. oh God you are merciful on a sinner, so good and merciful. just use me.

      i am so tired. this weekend was very nice. it is alwasy nice to return home. i spent a little too long in the sun, though and now i am paying the price. nicole too. we got cooked. it was nice though to see the fam. we will return in a couple of weeks to see her family. i met with floyd on sunday morning and we had a very productive conversation. i know that i am hearing a lot of people telling me to wait on God, but i am so afraid of getting complacent, and i want to go now. i need to leark self-control. that is what a lot of last week's Bible study was about. i got to hear willy preach this weekend. that was a treat as usual. the man speaks with great authority and he carries truth. i love him as a pastor and i look forward to meeting with him in a couple of weeks.i suppose i will start seminary classes this fall. don't know how i will pay for them. nicole needs to go to school and she has been waiting longer than me. she is so amazing and wonderful. her heart is just so huge and i love her very deeply. i am leary about what to with my job now. taht will pan out in God's time i know. there are a couple of entries in my written journal from the weekend, so i didn't post here. i need prayer. i need lots of it. i am going to have to remain strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. God has been eternally good to me and i will worship him. thank you Lord for all you have done. give me an unrelenting burden and push me forward on toward the goal. thank you for being so good God!

      i didn't post last night because i wrote in my journal. nicole was using the computer to print resume packets for ministry jobs. she is a true servant and i am grateful for her. i love the fact that she loves me. i am wonderful. i am excited about going to pensacola for the weekend. i am excited about what lies ahead in the next few days. i am troubled by the prospect of leaving where i am now because i did make them a committment. today was my eval and she gave the rest of the day off, and then i locked my keys in my car. oh well, at least i got to hang out outside with chasey. i pray for repentance today. i need God's love very much. humble is the key word if the last 24 hours. it's not about me.

      obedience is the part of our relationship with Christ that sometimes prevents us from moving forward. is it possible that God plants ideas or notions on our hearts and minds and then removes that initial excitement to build the character that we need to follow through on His calling? this is not to say that i am not as excited as i can be about the prospects that lie ahead in full-time ministry; it is to say that God will allow you to be challenged. i will follow through on this calling. i keep hearing that i need to be patient. i know this, but i continue to allow my spirit to perpetuate a restless sensation. i want to serve, and i know that God has called me to do it full-time. who knows what is going to happen next week? who knows what is going to happen tomorrow. i just want my heart filled with Christ’s love, and if I don’t “feel” it there, i am going to act on it anyway, out of obedience.

      humble me. forgive me. bless me.  it's funny how the devil works, trying to make you forget about things by just getting you to focus on the routine. not the things that have to be done in life, but the things that don't that are part of your routine anyway. tv, internet, laying around. i need to take actions and i don't know yet what that means. i asked nicole (today is our 5 month anniversary...i love her) to pray for me because i want to fast to focus on prayer. i am going to do it on friday i think. from midnight thursday to midnight friday. i don't know if i am supposed to reveal that, but no one reads this right now anyway. boy oh boy how i want to take action....on to the word.when i was tucking nicole in tonight, she asked me to read Ecclesiastes chapter 2; so i shall.  unbelieveable. solomon asked for wisdom, God gave it to him. solomon tried to find pleasure in earthly things, but there was none. his wisdom stayed with him, showing him that God is true and just and fulfills our needs. verse 3 actually says  embracing folly ! i put this off all night to watch last comic standing. worldly things have no value next to God's will. wisdom is good on this earth, but even it passes away. fullfillment is in God and God alone. this is why i am called to serve. even though i will pass away, along with all of the things i have done on the earth, i can serve Him and store riches in Heaven. oh to live for eternity, if only all could see.   ...he who has suffered in his body is done with sin - 1 Peter 4:1   'serious suffering for Christ advances the progress of sanctification'. when we suffer (persecuted, humbled), we begin to place our priorities in a more apprpriate order until we realize that God is all that truly matters.   for you have spent enough time in the past...they think it strange that you od not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and the heap abuse on you - 1 Peter 4:3-4   some people will not understand. it is not for me to judge. the very next verse states that they will meet God. i am not meant to live that life. i am not meant to be day-to-day in a secular job. God will lift me up as i humble myself (which can only be done by God). again with the clear mind in verse 7. i must be self-controlled and focused.  focused .  i will serve with the strength given to me by God. pray for me that God will make clear to me my path. i am going to pray a while now.

       the God of peace will soon crush satan under your feet - Romans 16:20   the Word says YOUR feet. through Christ's power, we have the stregth to crush satan under our feet. i have just prayed him out of this room, and i now sit with tears in my eyes over how powerful prayer is immediately. what a struggle exsists right now to keep my heart seperate from my mind. while i am to think with a clear mind (see last night), i know what is in my heart, and that is where God speaks to me now. It is amazing how distacting little things can be: web browsing, food, reality TV! i have a looooong way to go to where God will have me equipped to point where i can lead a full-time ministry, i know this. i also know, however, that right now is when i answer His call.  i am still reading in 1st Peter, but i had that verse from Roman's brought to me to overcome a time of distraction. 1st Peter chapter 3 is on relationships. how is what i am about to do going to affect all of my relationships? my wife is a lot like the wife described in the first few verses of the chapter   your beauty should not come from outward adornment  (although she is gorgeous   :)).... it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight - 1 Peter 3:2-4   she will lift me up and i will lift her up. verse 7 states that my prayers will be hindered if i don't do right by her. she knows how much i love her. what an amazing woman and amazing example she is to me. thank God for her.  verses 8-10 are lessons on how to relate to others. insult for insult, evil for evil. not quite. even if i wanted to apply these in my life now it is different as i am not called to a secular life. i am to apply these daily ion my full time ministry. (i get a chill when i think about that, i mean what a bonehead thing to put this off for so long).   ...always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciouly against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander - 1 Peter 3:15-16   again with the gentleness. there is a place for indignation, but the attitude of Christ is the one we are to mirror, and how many times did dude get worked up in the Word? once. one time in 33 years. i'm just going to keep it real. this is all about praying satan out of your life and the world around you. he will creep back up in there if you do not pray unceasingly. this is my plan for now. as God makes clear to me what He has for me, i will pray unceasingly. unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly unceasingly.... (ok sorry just kidding, not about praying, i mean i will pray unceasingly, but i was kidding about writing it over and over and over, but i guess i am not because i did it right? so if i am kidding then that would mean that i didn't actually write it and, wait...i've gone cross-eyed).

      my prayer is that i will decrease and God will increase. i am nothing apart frlom Him. i need His love in my life. i pray that he fills me with his love. that is all that i want. i want to please Him. i know that i must seek His word. i am going to do that right now, i just have to find a place to start. i am desparate. i am thirsty. i want God.  the book of 1st Peter is one of the NT books in which it is very clear, historically to know that Peter is indeed the author. nicole quoted from here last night about being clear-minded, and God has led me here even now to see the authority of this book.   1 Peter 1:13 - therefore prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given to you when Jesus Christ is revealed.   just like you prepare for battle, prepare for the Christian life. Jesus was perfect (1 Pet. 1:19)! men are perishable and will wither like the flowers of the field (1:24). the beauty is that salvation is for everyone on this earth; "once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God" (1 Pet 2:10).  live a good life so that nonbelievers will take notice and glorify God!   1 Peter 2:16-17 - live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God. show proper respect to everyone: love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.   boy, just read 1st Peter chapter 2. if you are beaten for doing wrong, then good, but if you endure the beatings that are given for doing right, then this is commendable, for we are to live as Christ lived. He was without blemish, and yet never retaliated when insults were hurled at Him.  dude, Christ took a beating and basically says taht we should do the same. i pray that i am prepared for this. how does this affect my relationships? chapter 3 is on husbands and wives...

      today is different. i have made a decision to give up everything i have and follow Jesus for my life's purpose. i don't mean increasing bible study time or being more involved. i mean i am quitting my job and moving forward to a full-time vocational ministry. i am going to work with young people and lead them in bible study, worship, growth, missions, and anything else God chooses to charge me with. my wonderful wife is with me, and together, we are going to do it. not like that pervert (well, maybe like that later today). God is so good, and i am so excited about the ministry that He has planned for me. for so long i put this off. i answered a call to ministry many years ago in high school and then just let it fall be the wayside. i pray for His forgiveness and beg that He pushes me forward in ministry. i am a couple of years behind in getting started, but that is ok. God is bigger than all of this and He will guide my path. i wish i could just jump in now, but i know He wants to equip me first, so i will wait on Him. pray for me. this is scary and exciting. humble me Lord. prepare me. it's all about You.

      it is crazy sometimes to think about the path that God leads you down. i have a great job with plenty of room to advance and make lots and lots of money; this, however, makes me sad and empty when i think about doing it for the rest of my life. my wife doesn't care about having a particular social status or having a lot of money. for a few hours i might have thought that that was important, but God is too big and too real to allow one of His own proceed too far with that mindset.  i realize that in this life we have a few options. live for God, live for ourselves, or live for everyone else. i have chosen to live for God. that is the bottom line. where that decision will lead me remains to be seen, but i know that when we step out on faith, God provides. peter stepped out on the water and walked until he lost faith that Jesus could keep him there. he then sank and felt pretty silly, and i imagine quite humbled. that is the word to me that decribes in the best way the way it feels to experience God. We live our lives very quickly with goals and direction and realize at some point (for some that is later than others, and for some too late) that it has been lucifer dangling a proverbial carrot in front of our face only to rip it away and poop on us. while i now aspire to succeed as a youth minister, that word "success" has a new meaning. it now means "to glorify God in everything that i do and say".  i have a long way to go in this regard. i will probobly never reach that point. we need Jesus because of this. it is quite simple really; God loves us and wants a relationship with us, so He became human and offered us the chance. i accept. i want that. it is truth, and truth is, in fact, what we all seek. what a feeling (yes i am talking about emotion) to be right in the middle of that. God hardwired me to crave Him, and i am now having that craving fulfilled, and hope to equip others to find the same thing and pass it on. this is ministry, and i want to do it full time.

      it has been almost a week since i have posted. nicole's family has been here. they are a lot of fun. i have enjoyed their company and i have gotten to know them much better. never try to go to a baseball game that is sold out if you don't have seats together, especially with lovely ladies who are prone to nervousness, bless their hearts. i heard one of, if not the, best sermons i have ever heard on sunday. it was patriotic, but not in a toby keith, flag-waving kind of way. it glorified God and espoused humility and love as the virtues of patriotism. call me a hippie. i did get four new shirts, so that is cool. i haven't had new shirts in ages (except for what my wife got me, they were awesome) our 6 month anniversary is friday. a half a year for pete's sake. we also got approved for our home loan today, so God is blessing. to the word...   ...the kings of the earth belong to God - Psalm 47:9    Psalm 47 is all about singing praises to God. we are not called to praise our leaders, although that is not to say that we can't. we are called to  clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy. - Psalm 47:1 . what a cause to celebrate. God reigns. He reigns over nations, kings, leaders, nobles, royals, preachers, worship leaders, money, the mountains, the sea, your river runs with love for...wait never mind, i digress. i can cry out to God and know that He is faithful to hear my prayer and answer it. it is going to be His way, but what would we need prayer for if it went our way all the time. sing praises, taht is very simple and it is repeated about 321 times in this Psalm. i am getting my guitar now. i will write tomorrow. He reigns!

      it has been close to a month since i last blogged. things have a way don’t they. you just get distracted. or maybe just lazy. yes, i think that is more appropriate. lazy. i am lazy. my goodness, i am lazy. i don’t even know where to start i’m so lazy. i sit around and watch tv and hang out with my wonderful wife and dogs (that’s right, plural, i have two: chasey and jay barker). it is something that i enjoy a great deal, because these are the most important people (and dogs) in the world to me. nicole is out of town this week and i miss her immensely. i don’t think i enjoy sleeping alone. no, not at all.  it is at a point where i must run after God as hard and as fast as i can. this is how the devil operates. i blame it on him, but it is my laziness that has kept me from sitting and truly seeking for the last couple of weeks. i need prayer and fellowship. i need scripture. i don’t know if anyone reads this, but if you do, pray for me. pray that i receive a “spark” of motivation that will spur me on toward the race. i am God’s and that will never change. jesus took me in and that will never change. i now have a responsibility to chase the principles by which i am called to live. relentlessly but with self control. heal me God.
