      So yeah, basically, I'm in California, Maryland right now, after a 4 hour drive.  Why would anyone name a city after a state?  Hollywood is right down the street, lol.  The hotel is ok I guess, and they have free internet access, which is what I happen to be using at the moment.  Aim Express SUCKS ASS.  Anyways, tomorrow, we'll drive the rest of the way to St. Mary's City, where my mom will drop me off and I'll be for 3 weeks, and she'll drive home.  And I'm sure that it'll be tons o' fun.  We're going to dinner soon at this crab restaurant thingy.  This place is the ultimate Hicksville, and in the middle of nowhere.  I heard that St. Mary's City is kind of like Jamestown.  *shrugs*.  It was only a 4 hour drive, with one rest stop.  There are all of these random baseball players running around in towels coming from the pool.  *wink wink*.  Apparently there's some type of tornement going on.  But they're like 12 though -_-.  But some are older, ;).  Lol.  So that's about it for my life at the moment.  I'LL MISS YOU GUYS!  I'm hoping that I can go online at camp.  *crosses fingers*.  Anyways, you can just call me on my cellphone I suppose.  (610)283-3553  ...la Gu

      Today is my last day posting for THREE WHOLE WEEKS!  That's because tomorrow, my mother and I are driving for 4 hours to Lexington, a city about 15 miles from St. Mary's City.  The next day on Sunday, we're driving to St. Mary's City and checking in at John Hopkin's CTY for camp for 3 weeks.  I'm taking a Cryptology course there.  Yay!  Lol.  But I'm pretty sure I won't have internet access, *tear*.  The reason that we're going a day early is so we won't be too rushed on Sunday.  Good idea, huh?  So since I'm like leaving tomorrow, I should probably be packing today, shouldn't I?  My first attempt to pack, I put my sheets in the bag, and then I went over to my next door neighbor's and hung out with Jamie, Evan (Jamie's friend), and Mia for a few hours until Jamie and Mia left for camp.  Evan was like flirting with Mia the entire morning.  Ick.  Then Liz and I walked to the Hair cuttery to get haircuts.  I got two inches off and got it angled in the front.  It looks like exactly the same.  Eh, whatever.  The second attempt at packing, Liz was just about to go to work, and she asked me to go get some film developed for her.  So being the nice sister that I am, I walked up to Rite Aid and got it developed.  Then I kind of decided that I didn't feel like going to Britta's party, cause I really need to pack, and because I'm rather lethargic today.  So blah, now I'm here, writing this, and I should be packing.  Third time's the charm.  Oh yeah, and tomorrow morning, right before I leave, Liz is leaving for the airport to fly to Los Angelos for 6 weeks to take summer courses at USC (University of Southern California).  So basically, until my dad gets back from Salt Lake City, my mother will be home alone.  How sad.  I'LL MISS YOU GUYS!!!  And I'm sure that you'll miss me too.  ;)  ...la Gu

      Oh my god!  The party was sooo much fun!  Even though like, Jen, Amy, Faich, and Dot didn't go into the pool once, it was uber fun.  Everyone came other than Jamie, cause he had friends over, and S'rah, who apparently never said she could come considering it's her birthday, but apparently, I have hearing problems when it comes to the phone.  Can and can't sound very much alike you know.  Anyways, everyone came in little groups that kind of amused me.  Both people from Villanova, Sam and Rachel came together.  All the guy Narbs came together, Faich, Tim, and Ben.  And that's about it for groups.  And I have no idea why I found that amusing.  *ponders*.  Anyways, we had food and stuff, even though we were a little behind schedule.  There was pizza, cake, and soda, all the necessities for a heart attack.  The pool was actually pretty clean, though it was kind of cold and Tim, Sam, Ben, Rachel, me, and finally Maggie and Sophie in the last half hour of the party actually swam and played games.  The other people just kind of hung out in the hammock and talked and ate and junk like that.  Mia didn't come until near the end of the party, and since she goes to a different school, only really talked to Sophie, my sis, and Dot.  It saddened me.  But eh, whatever.  And there were no teary good byes this time 'cause most of the people are going to Britta's party tomorrow.  w00t w00t.  Earlier that day I went to the mall and got some really cute capris from Aeropostale!  Shut up Alicia/Faich.  Then we went shopping for stuff for the party, like globe lights for the umbrella, and citronella tikis/candles.  The tikis were set all around the pool and looked really pretty at night.  There may have been a fire hazard considering the trees, lol.  But even with all the citronella filling the air, I still got like 2 mosquito bites.  Grrr.  But that's not nearly as many as I got at Tim's party!  Yay!  Hope you guys had as much fun as I did!  ...la Gu

      PART-AY!!!! Lol.  Yes, the party is tomorrow night!  Yay!  The final guest list pretty much is:  Dot, Mia, Sam, Jen, Rachel Fink, Amy, Maggie, S'rah, Sophie, Tim, Faich, Jamie, and Ben Fraimow  Since that's only 13 people, I may be making more calls tomorrow.  Stinky Alicia will still be at the shore for the party.  Grrr.  Anyways, I didn't really do much today other than discover like the bestest game ever, thanks to Dot.  It's called " urlLink Avatar High ", and it's kind of like the Sims online.  You make a highschool with 8 students and basically control what they do and who they have a crush on.  All the while they're also controlling themselves and making more crushes and relationships, and doing random stuff.  It's really fun, but it like uses up all of the memory on my laptop so I have to restart like ever 20 minutes.  I'm addicted.  Also, earlier today, I went to Suburban Square with Mia, and I got a shirt from Express, and some really pretty chrome nail polish.  It was fun.  I'm going to camp soon so I'm going to the mall tomorrow to buy stuff before the party.  Yay for the mall!  And then the next day, I'm going to Britta's birthday party and I'm in Sam's group.  We're going to dress up as the Spice Girls to get extra money, lol.  It's a scavenger hunt and we only get $20 to start out, so we need to do whatever we can to get more money, since there are 100 items.  Then I have a day to pack before I'm going to John Hopkins CTY (Center for Talented Youth) camp thingy in Saint Mary's City, Maryland, for three weeks.  I'll miss you guys!  (And I'm sure you'll miss me too)  I think I might die without internet.  Bleh.  ...la Gu

      Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I finally finished the book "Wicked: the times and tales of the Wicked Witch of the West" today.  It's been like what, two months?  Not that I was actually reading it half the time.  It's a very good book, and it really makes you think.  I would suggest it.  Two thumbs up.  ...la Gu

      Today I saw the movie  Saved! , an indie film with Mandy Moore.  It was very funny, and yet sad at the same time.  Dark comedy.  :D.  It's about these girl at a Christian school, who was very religious until she found out that her boyfriend was gay and she tried having sex to "cure him" and she got pregnant.  Mandy Moore plays one of her friends that becomes an enemy after the girl loses her religion.  "I'm filled with Christ love!"  Heh heh.  I saw it with the sis/Liz and with Dot.  Dot's sister, Nora, was supposed to come too, but she had work which sucks.  It was to be the Dellapennas and the Goldbergers reunited!  Because when we were young, Dot and I were best friends, and Liz and Nora were best friends.  But eh, it was still fun.  After the movie Liz and I went over to Dot's house, and Mix Master Dot is currently making us both CD mixes.  :D.  Then Liz and I both had dermatologist appointments, and while my mother and I were at Tepper Pharmacy, where we happened to see Nora working, it started raining like no other.  It was like a hurricane outside.  And the storm only lasted for like 20 minutes.  Craaaaazzzzy.  That's about it for the day.  ...la Gu

      Today was the first official day of summer!  Yay!  Even though I hate summer because I hate hot weather!  Yay!  Today, was a way to celebrate summer I suppose, my sister and I went swimming in our pool for the first time this year.  The water was amazingly clear and gorgeous, especially compared to the green it has been for the past 2 weeks.  Thank god for algaecide.  Everyone must go to my pool party on Thursday night from 7-10 p.m.  Actually, technically it's my sister's post graduation/pool/going away party since she's going away to Los Angelos for 6 weeks on Saturday.  But she said I could invite 15 of my friends too.  Her party isnt' starting until 9 and doesn't even have an ending time.  The guest list as is followed (changes may be made):  Alicia, Dot, Mia, Kim, Rachel Fink, Amy, Maggie, Sophie Quentin, Timothy, Faich, Jamie Kent, Chris Wert, Jake "Flash"  Well that's about it, if you made the list and haven't actually been invited yet, call me and tell me if you can go!  Go go go!  Anyways, today, I watched  Unda Cova Brotha  at my next door neighbor's house, and movies like that piss me off.  Because even though they're really funny, all they do is make fun of white people for 2 hours.  If a movie was ever made like that making fun black people, there would be no end to the complaints and controversies.  What people don't realize is that racism goes both ways.  Grrrrr.  Though I still like that movie.  We watched  Big Fish  too!  I love that movie!  Lol.  Not that I actually understand most of it.  That's about it for my day.  ...la Gu

      My father can just forget about Father's Day.  He doesn't need any presents.  :D  Anyways, New York, New York.  I would wilt away if I ever lived in that city.  Yesterday was the first time I've been there other than to go to the JFK Airport since I was too young to remember.  It was a  gorgeous  day, and the city actually looked pretty in the non slums part of Manhattan.    I had to wake up at 8, and I happened to go to sleep at 2:30, giving me only 5 and a half hours of sleep.  We left at 8:50, picked up my Uncle Bill and Aunt Helen, her mother, and my cousin Alex, the biggest brat ever born.  We got to New York at around 12.  We saw my Auntie Cathie's and Uncle Raymond's apartment, and then went to lunch at this Taiwanese style food court at this sorry excuse for a mall in the Chinatown in Queens.  It had pretty good food, and it was apparently very authentic.    After that we went to the Chinatown in Manhattan to buy cheap knock off purses from this woman that my Auntie Cathie knew.  She was kind of worried that she wouldn't still be there because the police had been shutting down a lot of these shops lately.  It was actually kind of funny, because it was like a shop on the street, and the bags were behind this metal door.  She had like ten lookouts on the street, and when it was clear, she would open the metal door really quickly, and you would have to grab the bags you wanted as quickly as you could before one of the lookouts saw a cop car and she would close it.  She would put your purses in trash bags and then you would pay in cash.  From her we got 4 Coach bags, 1 Louis Vuitton bag, and 1 Burberry bag for only $120!  I mean, that's the price of a very cheap Coach bag by itself.  Then we saw this lady on the street with bags we liked, and we literally jumped out of the car to buy another Coach bag, and another Louis Vuitton bag.  Then we went to this park in Downtown by the Hudson River which was very pretty, yet very windy.  The way the sun reflected off of all of the buildings was beautiful, and I regret not bringing my camera.  If I were ever to live in New York, I would want to live there, though it would be  VERY  expensive.  Then we went over to Ground Zero, and across the street outside of a Burger King, we bought 2 Gucci watches for only $20, and I got a Kate Spade bag for only $15.  Thank god for the police, because when they turned on their sirens, the sellers got really nervous and were willing to give you the stuff for any price.  After that we went to 5th Avenue, and while we were there, we saw the Olympic Torch on its way to being passed.  Like 5 minutes ahead of it were these vans for Samsung and for Coke, and we got free cans of C2!  Lol.  That stuff sucks.  *Coke Classic*.  After walking down 5th Avenue for a while, we got hungry and we finally went to dinner at around 9 at "Joe's Shanghai Restaurant".  Apparently this place is famous, and they invented the 'soup dumpling' which is a dumpling with soup inside.  But since it was famous, the wait was a half hour, grrrr.  We ended up not eating until 9:30, and we didn't finish until 11.  The food wasn't that amazing.  Grrrr.  That means that my mother and I didn't get home until around 2:30 a.m., the same time my sister got home from whatever she was doing. I slept most of the way home though.  Yay for sleeping!  That's about it for New York.  But still, I would never ever want to live there.  You can't go five minutes without hearing a car honking, it's dirty, it's crowded, the traffic is always horrible, you're always rushed, you can never let your gaurd down, and all in all, apart from the cheap designer stuff, it's not that pleasent of a place, and it's not that amazing.  I'm more of a Philadelphia/suburbian girl.  Philly is a much more layed back city and the suburbs are made for me.  w00t w00t.  Sorry for such a long post.  ...la Gu  P.S. I'm currently happy because I now personally have 3 Coach bags, a Kate Spade bag, and a Gucci watch :D.  No one needs to know that they're not real.  I mean, they're not even "Couch", or "Gukki".

      I almost forgot, I'm going to New York City tomorrow to see my Aunt Cathie!  It's kind of funny cause I hate NYC!  It's like my least favorite city ever, but I kind of actually want to go cause apparently she knows this store where they sell Coach/Burberry/Louis Viotton bags for only like 25 bucks!  That's uber cheap and I must get some.  I love Coach!  At least we're not staying overnight.  We're just going to go Saturday morning, and return Saturday night.  Fun times.  ...la Gu

      Okay, so I just back from Tim's birthday party, which was actually pretty fun!  Alicia and I collaberated and just blackmailed everyone so we could get oodles and oodles of cash since we didn't really care about the mystery.  At the end, since we knew we couldn't win with only our money, we just convinced everyone else to give us their money and we won the award for most wealth since we had like at least 7,000 dollars.  All I got were these stupid blue dice though.  But then Tim started handing out prizes randomly and I got a cap gun/caps!  Yay!  Then when everyone was leaving, everyone was like all like hugging and crying cause his party was probably like the last time they'll ever see some of their friends again since we're all going to different schools.  I was like pretending to be really sad with my fake whiney voice (which I'm very good at by the way) and it was fun.  Lots of hugging.  It was really funny, when Faich was leaving, he knows how homophobic Tim is, so he hugged Tim, and then gave him kiss on the cheek.  Tim was just standing there petrified and was like, ewwwwwwwwww.  And then I started fake whining again, so Tim gave me a hug, and he was like, "I'm gonna give her a kiss to make her feel better" and I didn't think he was actually serious, and then he like actually did give me a kiss and I was like.... eh... and I kind of just stood there frozen for like 5 minutes cause I was not expecting that.  I mean, it's Tim.  He asked me what a hickey was earlier this year.  Bleh.  Before the party Alicia and I went to the mall!  Yay!  We spent like four hours there in a last attempt to get Tim a present, and in the last ten minutes, we just bought one out of desperation.  It's actually really cool and it wasn't that expensive, yet it was very heavy to carry the entire length of the mall and we like switched off who held it every ten feet.  It's a massage chair!  Well actually like a pad that you put on a chair and it massages you.  It was only 50 dollars, and on sale from 100 dollars, so we only had to pay 25 dollars each.  Totally awesome.  And he really liked it considering we were like the only people who didn't buy him a gift certificate.  We kind of told people at the party that it was just a gift certificate in a giant box, and they believed us.  It was fun.  That's about it for now.  ...la Gu

        IT'S FINALLY RAINING!!! YAY!!!    Now let's just hope the humidity goes down after the rain stops.  Hmm... I hope Tim's party doesn't get rained out, though that would give me an extra day to get him a present... hmmm...  ...la Gu

      Okay, so at the moment there is 89% humidity, and I'm dying.  I mean, it's not even raning outside, and it's basically 90% humidity.  That's horrible.  The worst part is that it's been like this for like at least 3 days now, and death is upon me.  And worst of all, there's constant lightening/thunder, making stupid power outages that last less than a second.  Why can't it just rain already?  God damnit.  Well today, I didn't wake up till 4:30 p.m., w00t.  But that's probably because I didn't go to sleep at 5 a.m.  Heh heh.  I would have stayed up longer, but the sun was rising and the birds were starting to chirp.  I actually did wake up at 9:30, but I didn't think that 4 and a half hours of sleep were enough, so I went back to sleep.  I'm still feeling nauseous, bleh.  Tomorrow is Tim's bday party and I have yet to get him a present.  Halfsies anyone?  Now to quote Homer Simpson, "Marriage is like a coffin, and each kid is like another nail..."  ...la Gu

      God, I feel so fucking nauseous at the moment, and I've felt that way for the past few days.  Damn sleep deficit.  I ran out of steam over a month ago.  Today was the last day of school... which means that I'm probably never gonna see my friends that are going to Harriton ever again... *tear*.  All that we did today was get more people to sign our yearbooks, take pictures, and go to the talent show, which was pretty crappy.  They cut out all of the 6th grade acts, and I heard some were really bad, some were really good.  There were these 3 random 7th graders dancing.  Can you say future sluts of America?  That act made me even more nauseous than I already was.  The bands were all pretty good, like Tim and Sam ;)!  Lol.  But most of the solo singers were crap other than that first singer, and that random opera kid dude.  The little child prodegies of the Qian twins both played rather simple piano pieces.  The kid who cracked his knuckles was disgusting.  But the teacher band was soooooo cool.  Go Mr. Eskin!  Flute!  Lol.  I didn't know that Mr. Pitonyak played bass, but he was really good.  Does Ethan ever sit down while playing piano?!  *shudders*.  Dre and company were good.  It took me forever to realize that they were paired off in short colors, lol.  But the MCs were pretty bad.  They tried too hard and their jokes were horrible.  "Mirror, Mirror, in my hand, who's the fairest in the land?"  Haha.  After school I went to Kim's house for a pool/graduation party.  It was fun fun fun, though Alicia didn't go.  All we did was swim, eat, gossip, and watch  Love Actually , which is a very good movie.  The pool was so heated that there was steam rising from the water, lol.  They had this random guy from LM there as a lifegaurd and he knew my sister.  Eh, whatever.  It was fun, though Kim's mom was overly protective of her couch.  NO MORE DAYS LEFT OF SCHOOL!!!!!  ...la Gu

      So yeah, since I *graduated* today, my parents got me a camera phone as a graduation present!!! Yay!  It's sooo awesome.  I have Jamie's lava lamp as my background.  It's the same phone that my sister got for her graduation.  Graduation wasn't that bad actually.  It was outside (thank god) and it wasn't too hot.  I didn't trip or anything!  Yay!  though I was like getting chest pains and felt nauseous while waiting to "march" to my seat.  I got paired with Ian Packman... Eh.  Dr. Rosenau actually came up with a new speech this year!  Lol.  Though like the entire thing was bragging about how good he was at life.  And I mean, who would hate someone just because they had poor eyesight?  I don't get the logistics of that.  Whatever.  Tyrone didn't graduate.  He just kind of walked across stage when his name wasn't called.  Sucks for him.  It's hard to believe that the school year is over.  Good bye Welsh Valley.  I hated my experiance there, and I hate most of the people there, but eh, I'll miss it, slightly.  Yay for Lower Merion!  Yay for BC people!  Harriton   SUCKS ASS!  .  Anyways, after graduation I went out to lunch with my mom and my sister and we went to Fuji Mountain, which is like my favorite Japanese restaurant.  After I came back was lunch at school and yearbook signing.  It was a lot of fun, though it was overly hot outside.  I got soooo many signatures.  I got every single teacher's signature that I've had over all three years except for Munro's (since he pretended to hurt his arm), Mrs. Machnicki (since I didn't see her), and Mrs. Pillard (since I hate her).  Fun times.  And my picture wasn't overly bad, at least compared to last years and the year before.  De gustibus non disputandem est.  ONLY A HALF MORE DAY OF SCHOOL!!!!!!!  ...la Gu

      So basically, the class trip was today, and it was awesome.  I went on sooooo many rides and it was soooooo much fun.  But it's kind of annoying because now that I've been on all of the rides, and I'm used to them and don't get the adrenaline rush anymore, which was the best ride.  Nothing is scary to me anymore.  It's kind of ironic because just last year I refused to go on any of the big rides and hated roller coasters.  Now I'm a roller coaster addict.  Let's see... I went on Talon 5 times, Steel Force twice, Hang Time thrice, Waveswinger twice, the Dominater (the green tower), Thundercreek Mountain twice, White Water Landing, Thunder Canyon, Scrambler, Enterprise, the Wild Mouse, the Seadragon,  and probably some other rides that I forgot.  There were absolutely no lines at all and no wait was longer than 5 minutes.  It was amazing.  Harry lost his manhood on Hang Time, the last time I went on it, lol.  He has like this little bag of stuff and since he got on the ride too late to stow it to the side, he stuffed it down his shorts.  What he didn't realize is that the harnesses close down at the exact point where he put the bag and it kind of got crushed up against his "manhood".  In his own words, "It hurts every time we swing forward."  He was like seriously screaming from pain on the last part of the ride where you get held facing the ground and go downward and he was limping when he got off the ride.  It was hilarious, but I also felt really bad for him.  Eh, *shrugs*.    WE'RE GRADUATION TOMORROW!!! OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!  WELSH VALLEY CLASS OF 2004 BABY!  Heh heh, according to like every teacher in Welsh Valley, we're the worst class that they've had in 25 years.  :D  ONLY 1 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu

      Mwahahahahaha.  So apparently, my parents decided to get my sister a new picture phone for her graduation present.  And therefore, I got her old cellphone!!! Yay!  It's not as good as a camera phone, but it's better than nothing.  I'm really happy now!  And I can also send up to 100 text messages a month so expect to receive a lot of text messages.  Mwahahahahahaha.  Anyways, other than that, today was pretty uneventful.  I hung out with Jamie and Mia for a few hours and watched  The Birdcage , which was this movie about drag queens and such and I finally watched  Grind  which had like the most unbelieveable plot ever, but was still a good movie.  I *heart* Adam Brody, the guy who played the main character, and the guy who played "Sweet Lou".  They were all incredibly hot.  After that, I went to the city to see my brother, and we saw  Troy .  Bleh, they got the entire sequence of the entire war messed up, and they made it seem like the war lasted about a week instead of 10 years.  But they did cover most of the key events, though they left out a little and several Greeks died that weren't supposed to.  They left out all God intervention, which pissed me off but eh, you can't have everything.  The actress who played Helen was hardly beautiful enough to have launched a thousand ships.  Bleh.  I can't wait for the class trip to Dorney Park tomorrow!!! It's going to be so much fun, even though a lot of people aren't going, including Dot.  Whatever.  After Dorney Park, there's only graduation, yearbook signing, and the 8th grade talent show left and then it's Good Bye Welsh Valley, I won't miss you.  ONLY 2 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu

      Okay, this morning, Alicia wakes me up at 9:30 I managed to not actually get up until 11:30.  I'm soo good at that, considering I do it every morning when my dad wakes me up for school.  Then we watched the MTV movies awards, and my mom picked us up and drove us to my house.  We played some slime volleyball, and then walked to Faich's house, which only took like half an hour, but Alicia enjoys exaggerating.  We got there at like 2:40, and we didn't get home until like 6:30.  Basically, we hardly sat down at all that entire time, except when we ate lunch at  Maido  so my feet hurt.  Bleh.  But oh my god, I totally want to get this totally awesome camera phone where you can rotate the camera thingy around so it can face you.  It's hard to explain, but whatever, it's awesome.   When I got home, Alicia left, and I went to hang out with Jamie, my next-door neighbor for those who don't know.  We watched  The Big Lebowski  which is a very funny movie and we watched  Alex and Emma  with Mia, his sister, who's like my best friend ever.  We started to watch  Grind  which I've wanted to see forever, and which Jamie has seen like 50 times, but my dad called and made me come home.  Which makes sense considering it was like already 11.  Eh, whatever.  I'll probably just finish watching it tomorrow.  Yay!  I *heart* Adam Brody.  ...la Gu

      Okay, so yeah, the graduation party was surprisingly fun.  I did human bowling, and it was like totally trippy, and it kind of hurt, but it was really fun.  I was really afraid that everyone would beable to see up my skirt, but my friends said that you weren't able to.  I like pulled down my skirt like every 5 seconds cause I was really nervous.  Apart from that, there was basketball, football, skeeball, a velcro-wall, pitching, horrible music, dancing, and FREE FOOD!  I totally pigged out, lol.  There were Dippin' Dots, junk food, soda, pretzals, and more!  Lol.  It was fun hanging out with my friends, considering it's probably like the last time I'll ever hang out with most of them ever again, since most are going to Harriton.  The exceptions are Maggie, Faich, Ariadne, Jake, and some others.  Now that the party is over, I'm sleeping over at Alicia's!  Yay!  Since we weren't actually planning this, I have to wear Alicia's pjs, which are amazingly short on me.  It's kind of funny actually.  But whatever.  Fun times.  ONLY 2 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu

      So apparently, when I posted earlier, I forgot to talk about my amazing accomplishments!  I got Distinguished Honors, as usual.  I was really worried that Mrs. Pillard would give me an S and I wouldn't get anything at all, cause she was threatening me since I never actually do anything in her class.  But she was too lazy to change grades, which is what I expected.  And it's not like that do that badly in her class anyways.  Since I did mange to get Distinguished Honors, I have gotten Distinguished Honors every quarter of this year, which is the first year that I managed to pull that off.  In 6th grade, I got a stupido 91 in Science, and therefore a B, and I also got an S in Intro to Tech because I didn't finish all of the stupid typing tests since I couldn't type in 6th grade at all.  In the first quarter of 7th grade, Mrs. Waters gave me a stupido S in FACS because apparently I didn't do the stupid "Random Acts of Kindness" assignment and she was all like "you need to complete your homework more consistently."  And of course I had Mrs. Pillard as well in 7th grade and I always get an S in her class because I'm too lazy to do a stupid project in Physical Education.  God, these people take their classes too seriously.  Anyways, that's why I haven't had a perfect year until this year, and I'm very proud of myself.  And I got some random latin awards too.  An award for getting a *Gold Medal* (while Alicia got Magna cum laude) on the National Latin Exam, and two awards for PCS, one for my amazing project, and one for the academic PCS award, or at least that's what I think.  I'm not actually sure why I got two certificates for PCS.  Whatever.  Currently, Alicia is attempting to find an outfit for the graduation celebration thingy, without much luck.  Lol.  And we should probably be leaving right around now since it's like starting in 10 minutes.  Whatever.  The party is gonna be so much fun!  Human bowling and a velcro wall.  w00t w00t.  ONLY 2 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu

      Yay for being at Alicia's house!  I didn't feel like going home today, so I just got on Alicia's bus, without a bus pass.  Heh heh.  Alicia oh so nervous, but the bus driver didn't even notice me, so whatever.  And now we're having oodles of fun torturing Magus.  And I'm eating slim jims, yummy!    Anyways, tonight is the graduation celebration thingy!  And neither me nor Alicia have any school supplies to donate, but whatever.  Grrrr, I keep making typos cause Alicia's keyboard is icky.  Alicia is defending her keyboard and says, "It's awesome!  You just can't harness its awesome power."  Today was like the last real day of school, even though we didn't even do anything today other than graduation practice, which was boring, as usual.  We watched  Scary Movie 3  in Language Arts because Dan Stadlin had the DVD in his locker and it was uber funny.  Mrs. Lawley didn't even mind that they cursed like every 3 seconds.  That's about it for today.  I'll probably post again when I get back from the celebration thingy.  Thank god this week is finally over.  ONLY 2 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ..la Gu

      So yeah... for some strange non apparent reason, I'm updating again today... because I feel like it.  Anyways, haha, the Harriton graduation got rained out!  Sucks for them.  There was perfect weather for the Lower Merion Graduation, though it was a bit hot.  It cooled down today (thank god) but it's like still really muggy out.  Had Chinese food for dinner.  Yummy in my tummy.  Heh heh.  Tomorrow is Friday at last!  This week has taken forever to go by.  It was like the longest week ever.  Every day this week has felt like Friday, but of course, they were just being evil and trying to trick me, and they were all fake Fridays.  Grrrrrr.  But tomorrow is a real Friday!  Yay!  Oh yes, and I figured out what Nikhil and Bernard were doing.  I'm pretty sure that they were playing a game where each would try and get the most high fives from people on the bus, since they were doing it today too, and they were counting the high fives.  It was kind of weird yesterday, cause they didn't start until my stop, so I was like, "What the fuck."  They tried again today, but yet again, I was like, "No," and got off of the bus.  Pssssh, whatever.  GIVE ME A COMMENT NOW GOD DAMNIT!!!  IF YOU DON'T, YOU WILL DIE A HORRIBLE AND PAINFUL DEATH IN THE NEAR FUTURE!  GOT IT?!  Heh heh...  ONLY 3 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu

      Okay, well currently, I think my brain is about to melt.  Graduation practice is like the most pointless and boring thing ever.  We had an hour and a half practice today for the "promotion ceremony."  Soooo boring, considering basically all we did was practice leaving, practice entering, and then we just sat in our seats the entire time waiting for the entire grade to go up one by one and having each row practice standing up in unison.  And the most annoying part is that like Ian Cohen, Chelsea Citron, Justin Cerone, and Stephanie Cirillo were all sitting right in front of me playing this really annoying game, and it was like, shut the fuck up, especially considering that Stephanie and Chelsea were very bad at this game.  And of course everyone was sitting right into the sun so I was being blinded the entire time.  At least it's not as hot as yesterday.  And another thing adding to my brain meltage is the fact that the teachers aren't even trying to teach anymore, and all we're doing is watching movies.  I mean, it's nice at first, but when it's just like non stop, my brain basically dies.  Bleh.  In Science we would have watched  Jumanji , but we had Graduation practice instead, in Orchestra all we did was play "keep up the rhythm" and other such games considering it was a free period, in SS, the last teaching group finished, and then we started watching  Antz .  Then in Family and Consumer Science (FACS) we did our foreign food labs.  God, Mrs. Waters is like a dysfunctional Stepford wife, if that's possible.  My group was making canolis, since our country was Italy, and she couldn't get canoli shells, so she gave us tortillas instead.  Nasty.  Then at lunch two random girls were sitting at our table, and it was just like, fuck off!  Then in Language Arts, we just finished watching  12 Angry Men  which was surprisingly good for a movie in black and white about a jury.  And finally, in Math, we finished watching  School Ties  which was a really really good movie with Brendon Fraisure, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and others.  Now that we've finished watching all of these movies, I wonder what we'll do tomorrow.  If we have nothing but free periods, I think my mind will officially die from boredome.  Anyways, I've been rambling for quite a while now, so I think I'll stop.  I CAN'T WANT UNTIL DORNEY ON MONDAY!!!!  w00t w00t.  ONLY 3 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu  P.S.  Yay for Alicia getting her braces off!

      Okay, so it's 91°F right now, and with 38% humidity (damn Schuylkyll and Deleware Rivers), it currently feels like 93°F out, and therefore, I'm fucking dying at the moment.  I hate heat.  I love winter.  Even my eyelids were sweating today.  Gah.  At least I didn't have graduation practice yesterday, because as hot as it was yesterday, it was even hotter today.  Bleh.  Well anyways, it's my sister's graduation today.  Yay!  I wish it didn't have to be on such a hot day though, considering the graduation is outside.  It can't be as bad as last years though.  It was pouring and they had a four hour power outage.  I would just walk home if that happened.  Yay for living 5 seconds away from Lower Merion!  Yay for Liz graduating!  On a different note, it was soooo random.  When I was getting off the bus, Nikhil Gregg and Bernard (this 7th grader who's been expelled from 3 other schools) tried to give me a high five.  I was like, "What the fuck?" and just got off the bus.  Sooo random.  And I know they were doing it just to annoy me, but still.  Whatever, I hate them anyways.  ONLY FOUR AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu

      GRRRRRRRRRRRR.  Today we had "Graduation Practice", but in reality it was just simple torture.  Everyone with the last names "A-L" had to sit out in the burning hot sun for half an hour while Dr. Rosenau just told us the same things over and over that he could have told us in the nice cool auditorium instead of outside where we would have graduation.  I mean, we didn't even do anything.  GOD.  Die, Dr. Rosenau, die.  And the best thing is, is that he's leaving on "sebatical" the year that we leave Welsh Valley.  We never get to experiance Welsh Valley without him.  Double grrrrrr.  Anyways, on a more sane note, I got a 96 on my Extra Credit, Open Note Science Final!!! That is the same as my current average, so I get 10 extra credit points that I don't need!  Isn't that amazing?  I feel really sorry for Tim though, cause he got a 90 on it, and has a 91 average.  If he had gotten one more question right, he would have gotten an A for the quarter.  Poor Timothy.  Well I've ranted enough for today, so I shall stop now, though I know you don't want me to stop.  Lol.  ONLY 5 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!! ...la Gu

      Oh my god, I can't believe that I finished all of my finals, even though they were all like uber easy, and didn't even really count for much.  Today I took my Science Final, which was just Mr. Plumly's desperate attempt to have more than 5 people pass his class.  I mean, it's an EXTRA CREDIT, OPEN NOTE Final, how desperate is that?  Well it was really easy anyways, and i didn't even need my notes, so whatever.  Basically, if you get your average or higher on the final, you get 10 extra credit points, which really doesn't do much for the people who actually need it, so yet again, another stupid idea from Mr. Plumly!  And since I have like a 96 average (almost as good as Alicia, grrr), it doesn't really matter anyway.    Oh yeah, and just as Alicia has, I've been trying to find all the secret facts on  urlLink J.K. Rowling's Official Website .  So far I've found three, just as alicia has, and I can't think of anymore places to look.  IT'S REALLY ANNOYING!!! Grrrr.  So yeah, that's basically what I'm wasting my time on at the moment.

      Umm... yeah... I felt like going with the crowd and making a blog of my own!  Isn't that amazing?  So yeah, this is my blog!  I probably won't actually update it like ever... or do anything with it... but I might as well have one.. right?  Anyways... school is almost over, life is good, and I'm getting Distinguished Honors for the last quarter of 8th grade, if everything goes well that is.  That means I have gotten Honors every quarter, and I get a special star next to my name at graduation!!! Yay for me!!! Lol.  So basically... my life is boring as crap at the moment, so who gives a fuck?  Not me!  w00t w00t.  Now that you have read that pointlessness, have fun writing a comment!  ...la Gu  P.S.  And by the way, if you were wondering, the dates are in Hungarian! w00t!  Go Hungarian heritage! Lol.

       Today my father had like this weird party thing for these Enviromental lawyer people from Mainland China that are working at Temple... or something like that.&nbsp; O_o.&nbsp; It was strange, and I kind of refused to make an appearance until the last hour.&nbsp; Though I was forced to help with the preperations by the evil, slave driving parents.&nbsp; NEVER GET A POOL!&nbsp; It requires waaay too much work.&nbsp; I had to hand vacuum it today, and dang is that thing heavy, and it took forever.&nbsp; Grrrr.&nbsp; And no one even swam.&nbsp; What a waste.&nbsp; I actually had an excuse not to go to the party though.&nbsp; I was "packing", or more like waiting for my clothes to dry because my dryer is retarded.&nbsp; Grrrrrrrr.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I finally actually got down to packing at around 6, and I'm currently not finished yet, though I'm close.&nbsp; w00t.&nbsp; Somehow, it seems like I haven't packed as much this year, but whatever.&nbsp; I probably over packed anyways, like I always do.&nbsp; At CTY, I still had clothes that I never wore once.&nbsp; Bleh, labeling everything is what took me so long.&nbsp; It's such a PAIN IN THE ASS.&nbsp; Okay, that's my outburst for the day.&nbsp; Hmmmm... I should probably get back to packing.    &nbsp;  Oh yeah!&nbsp; I almost forgot!&nbsp; I got a haircut on Thursday and now my hair is like shoulder length.&nbsp; I didn't want to get that much off, but my mother made me because apparently I have split ends, which somehow, I am unable to see.    &nbsp;  ...la Gu    &nbsp;  Contact meh:    &nbsp;  Eugenia Dellapenna   c/o Appel Farm Arts and Music Center   P.O.

       Okay, so yesterday, I cleaned off my desk at last!&nbsp; There was like a foot high pile of junk on it and I cleaned it all off and I'm very proud of myself.&nbsp; It took 2 and a half hours in all.&nbsp; I even polished it and my hands smelt like orange oil afterwards.&nbsp; Then Alicia came to sleep over because she couldn't get a ride over tomorrow.    &nbsp;  This morning, we watched  Life or Something Like It  with Angelina Jolie, and left for the train station at 1:30.&nbsp; The train didn't come till 2, grrrrr.&nbsp; But at the train station we met these crazy, yet nice,&nbsp;people from Harriton.&nbsp; Then this weird homeless man came up to us after Alicia complained about the rain.&nbsp; He was like, you are blessed with whatever weather there is and that you should respect your parents and so on.&nbsp; I couldn't understand half of it considering that he had a really strong Jamaican accent, and it was slightly scary.    &nbsp;  Then we finally got on the trian, and we were slightly afraid that we would miss our stop, Market East.&nbsp; But of course we didn't because I would never let us do that.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; Then we walked like at least 15 blocks to get to South Street.&nbsp; -_-.&nbsp; Bleh.&nbsp; Then we found the store Guacamole surprisingly.&nbsp; That's the store that sell Floaties, and the only reason we went to Souf Street is to buy Floaties.&nbsp; Actually, that was Alicia's reason.&nbsp; My reason was to meet up with Jimmi, but he couldn't get a ride from Kutztown.&nbsp; Grrr.&nbsp; Then we kind of wasted away another hour because we were getting picked up at 4, and didn't even get there until around 3.&nbsp; And it started raining within the first 20 minutes and didn't stop.&nbsp; Bleh.&nbsp; But we didn't get THAT wet, only completely.&nbsp; We kind of just ran between stores, and played cards in Starbucks.    &nbsp;  After my dearest father picked us up, we went to Pat's Steaks, which are totally better than Geno's for any people who ever doubted it.&nbsp; Pat's literally invented cheese steaks, and even Alicia admitted that they were very good.&nbsp; It was her first time there, surprisingly enough.&nbsp; Alicia has a thing against South Philly, or all of Philadelphia to be more exact.&nbsp; She's kind of right behind me at the moment commentating on what I write.&nbsp; That's about it for the moment.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;*headbangs to the Ramones*    &nbsp;  ...la Gu

       Okay, so basically to sum up the past two days, I slept, and I watched a ton of Vh1.&nbsp; This is what happens when there's nothing to do, and this is why I choose camp over staying home all summer being bored.    &nbsp;  Yesterday, I watched  I love the 90's  and other Vh1 shows, which are all hilariouso.&nbsp; And then when I got bored, I called Dot, and ended up walking over to her house.&nbsp; We watched  High Fidelity , a movie about John Cusack and his relationshiop problems.&nbsp; I *heart* John Cusack.&nbsp; We also attempted to make pizza, but the top got burned, and the bottom didnt' cook at all, so it didn't work out very well.&nbsp; Wipe the vomit off my tongue.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; Then I got a ride home, and watched more Vh1.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; I attempted to call Dylan at like 11:30, but apparently he was asleep.&nbsp; Whoops.&nbsp; I think I woke up his father too.&nbsp; *blushes*.&nbsp; Heh heh.    &nbsp;  Then today, I watched Vh1, ate, took a 4 hour nap in the afternoon, read, watched Vh1, and wrote this.&nbsp; Now that's excitement.&nbsp; I think I have developed an unhealthy obsession with Vh1, but the shows are just so good!&nbsp; At least I'll get away on Friday when I'm going to Souf Street with Alicia, Dot, and S'rah.&nbsp; I'm planning to meet up with Jimmi there too, but they don't know that yet.&nbsp; Shhhhh...!    &nbsp;  ...la Gu

       Yay!&nbsp; I went to the mall today for the first time in like a month!&nbsp; Yaaayyyy!&nbsp; And my inner directory of the mall almost returned fully to me in the 4 hours that I was there.&nbsp; Though I did wander more than I usually do today, I actually knew where I was going for half the time.&nbsp; All of those mall trips really pay off.&nbsp; I was supposed to have this BBQ thingy with my Uncle/Aunt today, but it rained, so it was cancelled, and Alicia and I decided to go to the mall.&nbsp; Then it turned out that my Uncle was at the mall at the same time that I was, and he came over to our house anyways, but I still got to shop, so I was happy.&nbsp; I got a black skirt with white polka dots from Delia*s, a pair of&nbsp;dark blue, satin&nbsp;Chucks for only $20, shoe laces to go with them from Hot Topic, and a blue flower pin from Express, for only $5.&nbsp; I'm so proud of my buys, and that fact that I didn't majorly splurge, which I have a tendency to do when I've had mall deprivation, and when I have a lot of money with me, which I did today.&nbsp; I mean, I actually had money left over in the end.&nbsp; I think that Alicia and me have had our shopping skills decrease since we've been away from the mall for so long.&nbsp; It's quite sad really.&nbsp; I mean, we actually had left over time in the end, and we were only there for 4 hours.&nbsp; We've been crammed for time before when we went for 6 hours.&nbsp; What a travesty.&nbsp; But since we were planning to go to the mall this Friday, and obviously aren't anymore, we're planning on going to South Street Friday so Alicia can get some Floaties!&nbsp; Yay!    &nbsp;  Anyways, after&nbsp;my long sought after mall trip, I came home to a Chinese family gathering.&nbsp; Fun fun fun.&nbsp; Basically, that means lots of Chinese food, lots of talking in Chinese (which I am unable to do), having to spend time with prying relatives, watching my little bratty cousin, and of course, having your parents show off through their children.&nbsp; It's the Chinese way.&nbsp; At least my family isn't as bad as Alicia's family, heh heh.&nbsp; But it did mean that I had to play piano for them, and considering I haven't played piano in over a year, I wasn't too happy about that.&nbsp; But I didn't play toooo badly, just utterly and completely.&nbsp; I didn't even bother playing the whole song, I just played the first part of each and expected them to think it was over.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; And then they left... and junk...    &nbsp;  Oh yes, and during multiple times in the day, I called Dylan!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; We talked, it was fun.&nbsp; And then his mom yelled at him to get off the phone, so we're not talking anymore.&nbsp; *tear*.&nbsp; That's about it for my day.&nbsp; w00t.    &nbsp;  ...la Gu

Camp was oodles and oodles of fun, and I'm sure that you all missed me very much.&nbsp; I made tons o' friends, since I decided to get over my usual shyness, and be loud and outgoing.&nbsp; Everyone thought it was funny that I actually said, "W-T-F" like non stop, and several people called me the WTF girl, which is kind of disturbing when you think about it.&nbsp; This other guy, Mark, who's very strange btw, called me the "Hi" girl, since I always said hi to him, and that doesn't sound much better.&nbsp; So I'm now officially the "what the fuck" girl, and the "high" girl.&nbsp; w00t.&nbsp;&nbsp;And bleh, I got a rash from rolling in the grass.&nbsp; >.     &nbsp;
