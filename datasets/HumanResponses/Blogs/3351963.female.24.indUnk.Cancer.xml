      RESPONSIBILITIES OF FACILITY ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE OFFICERS   The Facility Ethics and Compliance Officer (ECO) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Corporate Ethics and Compliance Program at the Facility level.  It is anticipated that each ECO will take into consideration the available resources at his or her Facility and delegate the administration of those responsibilities that are assignable.  Specifically, the ECO will:  ·Provide leadership for the Facility’s Ethics and Compliance Program. 	 ·Encourage and stimulate a culture of ethical sensitivity and compliant behavior. 	 ·Distribute the Code of Conduct and ensure related training is conducted. 	 ·Communicate ethics and compliance standards, including the Code of Conduct and Corporate policies and procedures, at the facility. 	 ·Coordinate and monitor training regarding compliance with laws, regulations and Corporate policies and ensure appropriate documentation of such training. 	 ·Coordinate and support Corporate monitoring and auditing procedures, including internal audits. 	 ·Provide advice to facility colleagues regarding ethics and compliance issues and forward to, or encourage the use of, the Ethics Line when appropriate. 	 ·Coordinate investigations of alleged violations of ethics and compliance standards. 	 ·Review all Internal Audit reports and investigation reports pertaining to the facility and ascertain whether appropriate corrective and preventive action has been accomplished. 	 ·Serve as liaison to the facility’s Board on issues of ethics and compliance at the facility. 	 ·Coordinate, as necessary, with the facility clinical ethics committee. 	 ·Performs other related duties as required to support the Ethics and Compliance Program.  This comes from the HCA website.

           In the readings for this week, Chapter 2b (Perry) discusses healthcare ethics committees. I found an interesting study in  The American Journal of Bioethics  about healthcare ethics committees. The study, A National Study of Ethics Committees, was one of the first studies done on healthcare ethics committees. I encourage everyone to read the study; it was very interesting. I have provided a brief synopsis of the study.       In 1999 the University of Pennsylvania Ethics Committee Research Group (ECRG) completed the first national survey of the presence, composition, and activities of U.S healthcare ethics committees. The study revealed some surprising facts about the management of ethical issues in hospitals in America. The research group randomly selected 1,000 U.S hospitals and sent the director of the ethics committee a detailed questionnaire.        The goal of the study was to gain an overview of the structure and function on the healthcare ethics committees in the U.S. Of the 1,000 questionnaires sent, only 356 people responded. According to the study, 86% of ethics committees reported that they play a role in ongoing clinical decision making through clinical ethics consultation. The study also revealed that although 4.5% of healthcare ethics committees write policy on managed care, 50% of committee chairs feel inadequately prepared to address managed care. Although the study had a low response and faced limitations, the results can provide a benchmark for current activity of healthcare ethics committees.  McGee, G., Caplan, A., Spanpgle, J., Asch. D. (2001).  The    American Journal of Bioethics.  A National Study of Ethics   Committees. MIT Press, Volume 1, Number 4.

      Going along with this week’s theme in the readings in Hofmann and Nelson, I did some research and found an interesting article on ethics and medical errors. The article,"Patients' and Physicians' Attitudes Regarding the Disclosure of Medical Errors", was taken from The Journal of the American Medical Association.  Brief Summary: Thirteen focus groups, consisting of patients and physicians were organized in order to determine their attitudes regarding error disclosure. The results revealed that patients wanted disclosure of all harmful errors and wanted to know everything, such as why the error happened, how it happened and how it would be prevented in the future. Physicians felt that although information about harmful errors should be disclosed, they were reluctant to provide details. Patients also wanted emotional support from physicians but physicians thought that if they provided emotional support it would look like they were apologizing and could lead to legal ramifications.   I think information regarding errors should be disclosed to the patient and their family. Physicians need to take responsibility for their actions regardless of the financial and legal ramifications. Patients put their trust and lives in the hands of physicians and when an error is made they have the right to know how it happened.

      Ethics plays a big part in the healthcare industry. Physicians and nurses are faced with ethical dilemmas everyday. When a human life is at stake, ethics can play a major role. Ethics can also cause a lot of conflict between the medical staff and the administrative staff. Sometimes physicians what to make decisions based on morals and what is right for the patient regardless of rules and regulations and mangers want to make decisions based on rules and regulations. Physicians often don't think about the financial or legal consequences because they only care about doing what is right. Mangers, I believe have a harder role because they want to do what is ethical but at the same time need to follow rules that their organization and the healthcare industry have established and their decision may not always be the best decision.   The legal system creates laws that are fair but in some cases may benefit the patient and in some cases may benefit the organization whether it is the "right" decision or not, laws have to be followed and I think that is where ethics plays a major role in healthcare.   I look forward to reading through both books and seeing how mangers face these decisions and seeing what the authors have to say about ethics in healthcare.

           This weeks reading was on human resources. I started to think of the nursing shortage and why we have such a shortage. Why aren’t more people interested in going to nursing schools or medical school? Just from information in the media, readings and my conversations with people in the field I have a better understand of the reasons behind the nursing shortage.  Hospitals need to do a better job of recruiting nurses, offering sign-on bonuses aren’t enough.        I work in a hospital and I know how overworked and underappreciated nurses are. I wouldn’t want to be a nurse, not only are they overworked but they are the first to be blamed for mistakes regardless of the circumstances. Hospitals need to make sure the nurses they do have are happy first before they sign on more nurses and throw them into an unhappy, unhealthy environment. I think if schools and recruiters did a better job of making nurses feel that they are important that nurses would be much happier in their job. 	      I am a true believer in “happy employees make happy customers”. This age old philosophy that has been used in HR books is true. Nurses are pulled into so many directions. They have to wear so many hats. Although the nursing shortage is due to many things, the impossible environment that nurses are expected to work in is definitely one reason why we have a nursing shortage. After working in a hospital, I have a new found respect for nurses and think that they are just as important as physicians if not more!

      I was reading this weeks assigned reading, and the topic of moral obligation in healthcare was discussed. I started to think about the different moral obligations that the healthcare industry are confronted with. I think that all hospitals should be not-for-profit. I feel that  hospitals should not make money off someone’s illness or life. I understand that hospitals are a business and they need money to stay in business and continue to save lives, but the money they make should be used to purchase better equipment, expand the facility, and recruit more physicians. It should not be used to increase the salaries of administration. 	 	Although all hospitals say providing quality care for their patients is their number one priority, it seems that for-profit hospitals have other priorities. During my job search I had the opportunity to talk to many healthcare professionals, and almost all of them told me that working for a not-for-profit hospital would be better in the long run. They say the environment is completely different; people aren’t obsessed with bringing in patients to increase profits or putting pressure on physicians to bring in more patients. Hospitals top priority should be to protect the health of its consumers by proving quality care not to make a profit off of someone’s life. I think that moral obligations are often lost in the midst of making money. With the elimination of profits, hospitals are able to focus on what is important.

      Mergers have to be carefully planned out in any industry. Like Hofmann said, each organizations objectives, mission and goals need to be compatible. This will ensure that the merger is successful and that minimal compromises need to be made by each organization. In the case of the Roman Catholic Hospital merging with the small nonsectarian community was a bad idea. The religious aspects have limited the services once offered by the small hospital. You have to pick your partners wisely because both organizations’ future are at stake. We have seen some powerful and appropriate mergers such as AOL Time Warner. These two powerful organizations were already powerful by themselves, but by merging they have become one big powerful company that has gained a significant percentage of the market by combining two popular services. Many other business entities have had successful mergers by merging with organizations that can enhance their market share by combining two complementary services.  Hospitals or other healthcare organizations can also be successful and gain a larger percentage of the market share by merging with the right organizations. For example, if a few small hospitals merged then they could control a large percentage of the market share. However, I think it is tricky when a religious hospital merges with a non-religious hospital. The different beliefs can create a problem for both organizations and the community involved. Before merging, organizations need to do extensive research on the benefits and pitfalls of merging; it’s a big risk for both organizations and takes careful planning and implementation.

      Long gone are the days of simple 9-5 jobs, where you put in your eight hours and go home and enjoy the rest of the day. We are a generation of hard workers, we work more than eight hours a day, often times work through lunch and bring home work just to get up the next day and do it all over again. It’s hard to find that ideal balance between your professional and personal life, especially when you have a job that is so demanding. 	  However, the authors of Managing Ethically: an Executives Guide bring up a good point when they say how you manage your personal priorities has an affect on how you manage you professional priorities. Your decisions affect your character and how you respond to certain situations. Mangers are often required to work beyond the normal hours because of the role they play in their organization.   Personally, although I have worked hard in school to get a degree and get a good job, I think at the end of the day it is still just a job, and if I have to give up a lot of personal priorities then it may not be worth it. Although it may be hard to find a job that accommodates all your personal priorities, I think it is important to have a job that allows you to have a life outside of work.
