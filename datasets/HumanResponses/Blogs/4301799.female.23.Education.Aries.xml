        Welcome to the first day of class. Each class will be keeping a 'BLOG' as a way of accessing and rembering content that we cover in class.   Each day one of you will be posting a summary of what we did in class.  Writing this summary will earn you five bonus points to be added to your grade.  Anyone can make these posts however, you must sign up with Mrs. Greer and make sure that everyone in class is given an equal opportunity to earn these bonus points.

      Welcome to our class blog's.  As you can see I've decided to use the internet as a way of having my students document and keep track of things we cover in class.  Having this record online allows easy access to all students and to you - so that you can see what we're doing in class.  This particular blog can be used as an additional way for you to communicate with me.   Please feel free to post questions or comments to this blog that way the student blogs can be restricted to class content.  I look forward to working with you and your child this year. -Mrs. Greer
