        Throat's aching the hell out of me, my knee's aching like nobody's business, my head's aching(feels like elephants stomping in my head!) my back hurts like hell(especially the pelvis!) Hmm, bad day right? I got this feeling that i'm going to fail my a-maths test this time round, again. Sigh! Today after the tests, i prepared for NDP practice again. It's dumb. We walked down the stairs(not exactly walking, more like raising our thighs up 90 degrees when going down the stairs) and freeze somewhere. It's so below standard! Gosh! Throughout the whole thing my knee's throbbing, my head's giving me problem.      Now i'm being the crappy me, I tried playing the same music on this computer while my bro played it on his comp! Hahaha! well, it's cool, it has this surround sound feeling! I succeeded!-_-V Smart rite? Bwahahaha! Bet he's going: what is Jocelyn doing? Crappy person! But what can i do? I got to perk myself up somehow right? Hahaha! Kz, enough of amusing myself. Next week there's bio test, the whole book! Sooo, later i'm going to go study, like a good little girl. O_o'''      I planned everything out for myself but can i succeed in accomplishing what i set myself? Do i know what i just got myself into? Planned to get to VJ if possible, then go for Nanyang Polytechnic or fly over to UK and study physiotherapy there. Is it a good idea? Or is it one dream that i can't achieve? Is it what i really what to be? I don't know. Guess i'll take one thing at a time. *Cough Cough* Better get myself back to bed, i'm think i'm down with flu...sheesh!

       Heya! Got to complain about today, no choice! :) Weelll, today's first period-PE. I HATE MY PE TEACHER! Not that i hate the lessons, but the teacher is horrible! I busted my knee and gave her a doctor's MC(can't get her a doc's letter 'til i go for the next appointment right?) I can't do PE so i just stay in my pinafore( look! if u are going to take it out and later wear it back later, what's the point of taking it out?) She made me and a couple of other friends go all the way to the front and ask us why we can't PE. I mean, yea, it's NAPFA test and stuff, but in the whole school, how many people get a busted knee? It's me only! When i told her i don't have a doctor's letter she asked me to go and change! Sheesh! Well, i rebuked her by saying: " I gave you an MC!" And the reply? "Oh is it? I better go check it out..." How shallow can she get? Sigh! Anywayz, in my own free will, i went running the last lap with my friend(who had suffered under that teacher too) She's not feeling well and she don't have a doctor's letter, so she got to run. Being the guilty me, i ran with her so now, i'm stuck with a throbbing knee which hurts like hell. I can't blame anyone right?   Hmm, boring week actually. Loads of my teachers are absent this week, so i got loads of free periods. I studied as much as i could(obviously not a lot) Yupx! So now i'm here, slunking in the computer chair typing crap. Hahaha! What rubbish! Well, gotta go! Ciao!   PeaCe oUT~   Jocelyn

I cannot forget       &nbsp;   I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do     Follow me there     A beautiful somewhere     A place that I can share with you       &nbsp;   I can tell that you don't know me anymore     I    t's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget     And being on this road is anything but sure     Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget       &nbsp;   I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do     Follow me there     A beautiful somewhere     A place that I can share with you       &nbsp;   So many nights, legs tangled tight     Wrap me up in a dream with you     Close up these eyes, try not to cry     All that I've got to pull me through is memories of you     Memories of you     Memories of you     Memories of you       &nbsp;   I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do     Follow me there     A beautiful somewhere     A place that we can share     Falling into memories of you and things we used to do

        I'm back! It's monday and i don't have Monday blues! For once!(weird!) well, today was really queer. I hadn't been in my class much! We've been moving around the whole school. Yea, don't ask me why. First, we went to computer lab 4 for chinese, then we go over to IT Resource Room for E-maths, then it's recess. Followed by Geography in Class 1/2 and English in Computer lab 4 again, A-maths in class and Social studies in Class&nbsp;1/3.&nbsp;    Something really funny happened during&nbsp;Geog lesson.&nbsp;The sec 1s are so funny. Amusing actually! They came to their classroom and were&nbsp;kinda shocked to see us(it's their recess you see) and they were discussing among themselves, is this our classroom? what are they doing here? Hahaha!&nbsp;My geog teacher was going, "&nbsp;Come in! Put your books and&nbsp;go for your recess!) And&nbsp;none of them dared to come in! Hahaha! How lame! Anywayz, i&nbsp;got back my test paper for geog. Quite disappointing that i got a B3, i was hoping to get an A2 at least. I spotted one mistake&nbsp;that my teacher made! Maybe i'll&nbsp;get an A2(i got a&nbsp;high B3! Yay!)&nbsp;    It was kinda funny that i don't feel like sleeping during social studies. Isn't it one which you can practically doze off without knowing? Lolz!&nbsp;I was listening so attentively that i meself&nbsp;were surprised.&nbsp;The whole topic's about romantic Venice. With it's&nbsp;clear&nbsp;blue skies and beautiful artifacts and old buildings. The many streets you can&nbsp;lose yourself in and the many canals that serve as roads. I want to go over there,&nbsp;for a real trip maybe by myself or with some&nbsp;friends whom share the&nbsp;same passion for travelling with me, to explore. It's so beautiful. I just wish i can tour around the world( without the 80 days of course!&nbsp;i wanna take my own sweet time!) ...sigh! *Smack!* Day dreaming again!O_o'''&nbsp;    Okie, back&nbsp;to topic. I just found out i&nbsp;forgot all about the footdrill lesson that me and Qiutong promised to teach our sec&nbsp;2 juniors! Oops!(Sorry Qiuts!)&nbsp;Yea, i rushed home asap. Just for the fun of it and to use the computer! hehehe!&nbsp;    Just now, my mom came&nbsp;pestering me.&nbsp;About studying and doing&nbsp;ten year series and stuff. She kept telling me that i got to do more than&nbsp;3 times&nbsp;of the&nbsp;TYS! Gosh!&nbsp;Cut me some slack! I really am studying! Whoa! I&nbsp;KNOW prelims around the corner, and I KNOW that i&nbsp;gotta study so i DON'T&nbsp;NEED ANYMORE STRESS! If i don't score well, i guess it's my loss! But i hope to score well, get into a great JC and move on to physiotherapy. I really wish to do well, better than my brother. No kidding, so now i'm gonna wish my old self back! The one which brought me to TKGS and the one that brought me through sec&nbsp;1 and 2 with flying colours! I&nbsp;swear that i'll do well, really&nbsp;well and let my&nbsp;parents' money become worthwhile! (tuition fees, it's really&nbsp;high! too high! and i don't want it, although i need it.):(&nbsp; Do well! More motivation! Bwahahaha!     *Dreams are touchstones of our character.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Henry David Thoreau-* &nbsp;    PeaCe OuT!~&nbsp;    Jocelyn&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Sunday's today. Non-stop tuitions like always. Read yesterday's entry and i think i'm just moody, like always. Lolx! Just finished my biology tuition and now, sitting in front of the computer, trying to add my worth of words before i get "banned" from using the computer in...half a month time.    Okie, i&nbsp;went for a-maths tuition, give ear rubs to both Whiskey and Pabby. Being the crappy me, i gave some indian foodstuff that my teacher gave me, to Pabby( horrible right? the food is hot!) Weelll, smart Pabby took a little nibble and spit it right on the floor! He got this blur look, i thought he would eat it and run off for water!   Did some a-maths, preparation for the test on sat. Hope i can score well!    Well, now all i'm doing is crapping, then i'm back to studying wish me all the best! Bwahahaha! Ciao    &nbsp;  PeaCe OuT!~   Jocelyn    &nbsp;

       OKie, I know this is so dumb, 2nd entry of the day! Maybe i'm just bored and stuff...i should be studying my ass off now, but i'm online, freaking hell! Sorry for all the curses, just not in the mood. I keep thinking, am i missing something really good over at the cadet's recognition day? i'm not so sure...maybe they'll get something to talk about later, but i'm the "extra" one...like always. Like talentime, like link telematch...maybe i'm jealous, maybe. But i wanted to join, what's so wrong with that? Did i make the wrong choice? Or is my life going to be like this forever? I never know? Haha, maybe my blog title is totally out, sheesh! I'm using this to crap all my questions that pent up inside me.   Well, my mother just came back from this meeting, what's more, she screamed at me, like always. The main reason: I didn't help her keep the clothes and i somehow or another messed up the instructions she gave me, to wash my brother's army clothes. I know i'm in the wrong, but did she have to yell at me? IN THE BACKYARD? Now ALL our neighbours knew that i mess up something. Talking about my gram being like that and she got to suffer the humiliation, now it's happening to US, her kids! Gosh! What has the world come to? Or am i going mad?    Mom is always screaming at me, not once did she really keep a smiling face and really talk to me. That's probably why i don't share stuff with her. I mean, i don't feel home&nbsp;in my home at all. All i do say to them mostly, is hi and goodbye, and that i'm staying back&nbsp;before i'm back, hiding in my room, where i find solace. It's been like this for a while. (Don't tell me i'm PMSing!)    Hate is too strong a word to use, i never wanted to use that word. More like dislike. I want to go out and stay out. sometimes, i just don't think i belong anywhere! If i do&nbsp;go out, many would think me as a chatterbox, always smiling and stuff. Is that what reality is supposed to be?   Man! this is totally depressing, if i go on like this i'll probably land myself in Woodbridge! I used to laugh it out, does it still work? i work all of them out in sports but that's out of the question now. Study my heads off? For what? all i get is a&nbsp;degree and i got to slog my ass off too. I can't shop for my favourite clothes, my mom don't agree. So what? What's life? really?&nbsp;Where's the old me? When Simon told me that i still sound&nbsp;the same to&nbsp;him, is it true? Why do i feel so...different? As if i had aged alot, and all i feel is&nbsp;tiredness. I can go on sleeping and sleeping(don't worry, i won't end my life so soon!)&nbsp;   Maybe i should just get to some layback countryside, where i can bother about my own life and nobody's there to yell at me.&nbsp;Loneliness sometimes can kill i guess, but i don't give a damn(Pardon my french!Heez!)    If i go on like this i'm really going to freak out and breakdown, and that's definitely not what i want! I&nbsp;did proud by not crying my head off for these 2 weeks~&nbsp;and i hope to make it last forever! No more tears, uh-uh! Yun Qi told me i was too compassionate, too&nbsp;sensitive and too sympathetic, willing to help. Is that really true? Maybe it does, and it does hurt. I may not tell, and i&nbsp;do keep a happy face. Maybe i should change. Change out of all this pathetic me. Stop trying to help and just shut up..reminds me of the song that Avril sang.    " I wake&nbsp;up in the morning, put on my face. The one that&nbsp;will&nbsp;take me, through another day..." Quite true. Better end!   Jocelyn &nbsp;&nbsp;

       A week had gone by, so soon, annddd...i'm all alone at home. Not that i hate it!:) I mean, i'm&nbsp;always so proud of&nbsp;my own room and the silence(or noisy atmosphere-music&nbsp;blasting from radio)!&nbsp;Weelll, the only way to know&nbsp;if i'm at home is to check if&nbsp;the&nbsp;music is blasting!&nbsp;hahaha! No choice right? i practically live there!    Can't wait for prelims and Os to end, then i can have fun. Seems like my life now is stationary and boring. Not a sparkle of light...sigh! It's so...predictable! My life had never been so predictable! :X    Anywayz, today had been "fun". After my e-maths test( lucky me! it's not that difficult!I actually KNEW how to do the questions!Gosh!), I got to rush off(kais not exactly rush, i got time to polish my boots and get my uniform on really slowly)&nbsp;and practice&nbsp;flag bearing for NDP. It's alright i guess. We&nbsp;practised over and over again. Carry the state&nbsp;flag is no easy feat! (I'm sooo short that's why i'm in front!O_o''') You got to&nbsp;make sure that the flag&nbsp;is straight and taut all the time...sigh!&nbsp;    After that, i got to rush off(this time i really did, changed into my school uniform and sports shoes in 3 mins!&nbsp;Record time! Yay!)&nbsp;and get to the career awareness talks! Sheesh! Maybe it's not that interesting, but i found out all i need to know&nbsp;about physiothearapy! I can go&nbsp;overseas to study(a nice experience!) for 4 years straight or a 3 years course&nbsp;in NYP(Nanyang Polytechnic) and 1 year overseas. But i don't want to be bonded to any hospital and stuff...quite an eye-opener!    I went out to have&nbsp;lunch with my boss that's&nbsp;Yun Qi,&nbsp;Hui Yee, Soo Ting. Sigh! Gotta have lunch with some les(no offence!) but i mean they can act a little more decent right? I'm innocent and stuff!(weelll, maybe not&nbsp;THAT innocent!)&nbsp; Now i'm Home Alone. Listen to California,&nbsp;song&nbsp;from OC the series.&nbsp;Some people say that if&nbsp;the song is played backwards it's some message from satan. Hmmm, i don't know if it's true and i refuse to try&nbsp;it! Hahaha! The song's nice though! But i&nbsp;still like the song i posted previously! Hahaha! Kaiz,&nbsp;that's all for today&nbsp;i guess!     * Never be bullied into silence. Never allow&nbsp;yourself to be made a victim.

       Tomorrow's test day, like always. What am i supposed to do? Bad day like always...Hmmm, guess today's brooding day...sigh! First thing first...i got the shock of my life again(though i should know already) how near prelim is! Argh! Anyway, i got totally freaked out, i mean, if you put an e-maths paper in front of me now, i'll flunk it! Totally! Oh no! I want to practice but what am i doing here? I never know...    There's this career awareness talk tomorrow. Bet my bed that it's gonna be boring! What's more, i got flag bearer's practice tomorrow too! Sigh! why, in the first place, did i become soft-hearted and joined? All of them are sec 3s! Dumb me!    I feel rather guilty now. Should I? since i'm not going for the cadet's recognition day. Is that okay? I mean, am i missing something that i'll regret all my life? I really don't know...and i don't wanna know.    Today, i must really thank YC. She did a whole compilation of the 4 years we had in TKGRCY, making my day much more depressing. And the trip back home from school doesn't help! I blasted my music so that i won't think about anything. But all it gave me was a headache. I'm&nbsp;still thinking about&nbsp;end of the&nbsp;year, about&nbsp;next year, and the future...and suddenly, i'm just afraid. I don't know why, i'm&nbsp;frightened and the urge to cry is always there...maybe&nbsp;it's just me, being too sensitive and all. Guess i'll just shut up over here and go on brooding my night away and doing my&nbsp;revision for maths.     &nbsp;   *The day&nbsp;went by and became yesterday.

       Sunday! In the park you'll see people strolling and stuff, and what am I doing? Having tuitions...-_-''' Nice life! I went over for A-maths&nbsp;and like always, a routine for me, give Whiskey a belly rub, Pabby a scratch behind his ears, a pat on the head for Marble and some crackers to Kiko!( All dogs mind you!) Before we&nbsp;went right in depth tooo(drum roll pls!) Linear&nbsp;Law!-_-'''&nbsp;    Hmm, what's nice is that my cousin came over! Yupx! My ever dearest cutest little baby cousin! He's sooo cute! He was so amused by the Winnie-the-Pooh ball(my younger brother picked it up, how cheapskate can he get?!)! You just gotta bounce the ball once, and he went laughing in that cute effectious giggle! Adorable kid!    BUUUTTT! (a but is always there, sigh!) I had biology tuition! What luck! ANNDDD, i just found out how close to Prelims and Os i were! it's less than 2 months! God help me!Argh! The news just hit me in the head, literally!(My bio teacher boing me&nbsp;on the head with it!) Enough to give me a reality check! Darn!

       Well, life is fine. My brother just came out from NS, so i spent some time with him.&nbsp;I had geography AND chemistry&nbsp;CAs today...it's not that difficult.&nbsp;What's more, i actually studied hard for it! Just hope i can really score well...    Thinking of joining HQ&nbsp;after going&nbsp;JC (provided&nbsp;that i'm going of course!)&nbsp;but i can't do much running. Can't believe why i'm so careless-&nbsp;busted my knee! -_-''' How lame can i get?&nbsp;I wanna go for swimming too.&nbsp;Will that&nbsp;be too stressful? I really have no idea...    Met Simon Lim online today, unbelievable! (someone slap me or something) He actually came back to Singapore not long ago and i missed him( someone slap me again)! Hmm, i don't know why it takes so long to just find his contact, 4 long years! Guess when Tasha came back for 2 weeks of holidays let me think of the bittersweet memories when we're young and innocent. Haha! Sound so....dotz~Reminiscing...

        Today's cross country. Yesterday night i stayed up late to draw the dumb dragon's head and tail. I took 2 hrs to get the dumb snout out. Sheesh! I was so tired then, i decided to go and sleep. The dragon's for the balloon float you see. I set my alarm at 1am, but i overslept. Darn! I literally jumped out of bed at 5am and tada! I went about rushing, painting the dragon as best as i can and finished the head in an hour. By then it's 6am! Sheesh! I haven't even make my princess hat! I bathed and changed in record time(5 mins)and went about doing the hat. I finished in 15mins. Yea, and off i go running to Cross Country which is held at East Coast Park. I really like my dragon's head! Hehehe! Not that i'm big head or anything, everyone said it was really nice, and Mel took it home!(So flattered!)      my class ran and got 3rd for running, though i did not run, i feel really happy. I really wanted to run, but sigh, my knee, again. It's fun to run and challenge one's body to the extreme. I joined last year and i'm so stupid, i didn't stretch and i got a hell of a stitch! Not really nice to run with. I got through though, barely. Hahaha! This year's the only year i joined the Zany Green parade and stuff, we paraded alright, with the balloon float dragon. We got a really yucky idea. Hahaha! We got 4 people dressed as knights and the rest of us as princesses. When we reached the judges, the "knights" yelled and charged forward and we "princesses" were supposed to gush over them and run after them like some mad fans or something! Hahaha! We did that alright! With loads of screaming! Lolx! It's really cool. I had fun but it's also one of the most boring one. (Course every year i'll be running or doing first aid duty.)     Later we went off for Mac, and ate. (Duh!) Then i got home for Bio tuition, and here i am, crapping. Better go off to have my dinner! Ciao!      PeaCe oUT~     Jocelyn

        Okie, today's the same. Lessons as usual. Later i'm going to watch Singapore Idol, it's sooo stupid! Everyone wants to be the next William Hungs! A little stupid huh? Copycats!      I did something really horrible today. I borrowed 2 comic books from Xin Hui, supposedly, but i ended up being the bad gal. I took the comics and i didn't know they actually belong to Rachel's sister! And it's overdue! *Groans!* And i got Rach into trouble! Sorry rach! I'm gonna go with her to return them, it's my fault! Her sister's screaming at her! I'm soo soo soo sorry! Guilt ridden! Better get running! Ciao     PeaCe ouT!~     Jocelyn

       I'll probably be laughing my head off when the Os are done, but what can i do? Well, Yu Ching invited me to go studying with them today at the Marine Parade Library and i bet this will be the only time. I think they find me irritating, which is quite weird cause i didn't really talk alot. I had tried to study and obviously it did work. I finished 2 chapters today. Tomorrow there's Social Studies test. Essay test. Sigh.    I'm now extremely tired. It's rubbish to feel tired now, but i've been concentrating! Really, for once. Maybe i should go and study more often. Chemistry tuition after that, learnt something about polymers and polymerization.    Yesterday was National Day. It's not really a holiday, i went for 2 tuitions-Biology and A-maths. Study, study, study. I dying of boredom! On my way back from A-maths, i sent a little postcard to Simon( it's supposed to be a surprise, but if he reads this, then...:P)    I watched the last few parts of National Day Parade. It's interesting and i really envy those over at the stadium. No use getting jealous really, but being in the contingent once is really a once in a lifetime experience, hope next year i can join it again.    The problem is that my mom WANTS free tickets! Sheesh! i'm not one who gets free tickets! They're really glad to watch it, and i'm proud of their constant support of NDP, but must they be sooo.....kiasu?!   Next is Singapore Idol. It's totally crap! I didn't really see much of talents, but more of the next William Hungs. O_o''' It shouldn't be this way. I find Dick Lee so cool! He's one cool judge! Hahaha! No wonder his songs always rock! He's really good too. One of Amanda's friend got into the 2nd round, if i'm correct. Wish her all the best then!    Better go over to read and get some sleep. I'll wake up early to study. Hope i can wake up! Hahaha!    *The pure and simple truth is rarely pure and is never simple.                                                                              -Mark Twain-*    Peace Out~   Jocelyn

       National Day's around the corner and we got our well deserved school holidays until tuesday and on the oncoming wednesday? we got Social Studies Test, Essay! *Cried out in dismay* Time to study? Yupx, that's an underestatment!    My parents want my bro to talk to me about something, and i can bet that it's about my mobile bills again. I know, it's been horrible, me using past the limits and stuff, but it's because of the ringtones! I swear! I didn't mean to overuse it! Okie, i guess i better swear upon my room, that i shall not overuse it again! Sigh! My mobile's screen has a scratch and only God knows how it got there! *Heartache*    Yesterday's been a really relaxing day, i did nothing except watching tv and i'm getting rather guilty about it. The problem is it's getting on my nerves, all the studying. Is that how you should feel before a big, humungous and of serious importance test? 'Tis all i can do to not lie in bed everyday, reading stories about Scotland and it's ruddy land. 'Tis really interesting. Hahaha! Better stop this crap. :P     Speaking of which, i better start studying and get some serious work done, if i still want to travel the world that is! And still dead-fix in that! I want to explore the beautiful Venice, the tower of Pisa, the wondrous land of Scotland and New Zealand. The rich culture of Holland and how can i forget Spain and UK? i want to see US with my own eyes, California, San Fransico and all the beautiful beaches. Nice dreams and they can only be fulfiled if one has the gold to spare. All that really counts in this world is money, right?      Sheesh! What am I doing? I should be studying not daydreaming! Sigh! Mom's been screaming today again. See, today's not such a great day afterall. Not a nice one to wake up to one's screaming. Especially in a loud and screechy voice. I know i'm rude(sorry Mom) but i'm really pissed off by that. She scolded me for arranging my tuition at 10. But what can i do? I have many tuitions to arrange as well as for my brother! I can't always spoon feed him and helping everytime! It's not easy, and i need to do well so as to not get the two folks worrying. I must do well, for their sake AND my sake. Right? Sigh! All i want to do is write songs, but it's impossible cause my songs are not good, and my poems sucks. So ya, what's the point of keeping that, right? Kz, enough of it, going offline to really study!      *Un croquis vaut mieux qu'un long discours.    Fr.

        I woke up to my mom's screechy voice, waking me up for Chemistry tuition. I somehow or other started to like chemistry. Thanks to my tutor i supposed. I like organic chemistry! It's cool! Hahaha!      My mom screamed at me, again. No big news. But being the good girl(yea right!) After tuition i helped her keep the clothes. Planning to do some studying over this National Day holiday. It's 5 days, almost a week. What can i do, besides studying and reading of course?     I wonder when i taste for music become rather mild, not the usual quite loud ones anymore...like Avril Lavigne. I went for piano songs and ballads. Funny. I find the usual songs...loud. Remembering last night. Trying to arrange tuitions on National Day itself on my mobile, i played a couple of songs played on piano, and i fell asleep. With the lights on and music still playing. My mom shook me awake at about 11. Sheesh! And it's too late to reply my teachers, so i got up and turn off the radio and went right back to sleep.      My mom, after her nap(which is during my tuition *roll eyes*) came down and for once, didn't scream at me when she saw me downstairs(Thank God!) I'm really guilty for screaming at her sometimes. But i have no choice! See, i like to come downstairs to relax and i don't need another person to push me to study! In fact if i'm pushed, i'll rebel and NOT study! Isn't that worse? I can't talk to her. Never can.      Now, i really do miss those days when i'm ignorant, nothing to worry about except being tomboyish. Hahaha! Having all these emotions coursing through me is rather unbearable. Now i'm just bored, bored of studying.     Supposed to go for Leon's party today.(Sorry leon!) But i didn't go(obviously, or else why am i typing this?!) i just don't feel like and can't party. No way, i'll probably bring down the atmosphere or act stupidly. Hahaha! I got this feeling that a splitting headache's coming. Sheesh! Better get running, i think i'll go for a round of piano playing before going for lunch.       *Telling us to obey instinct is like telling us to obey 'people'.

       I had fun today, in school. Surprisingly, i survived in my kebaya! Whoa! big feat for me this kind of tomboy! Okie, i'm on heels, and the heels are really thin! Gosh! How can i go about in that?! *Shake my head in wonder* Anyway, i got skin tear because of the strap of the heels, but what's it compare to the fun i had?Later, maybe, i'll post a my pic in friendster...heehee, just for the fun of it!    First thing first, the flag bearing! I almost break down and weep(kz, it's too exaggerated!)  I ALMOST dropped the flag! I can feel it slipping off my fingers and i'm thinking: okie, focus jocelyn, FOCUS! no dropping of flag, no way. You got to hold on, tight! and I mean REALLY tight! Don't ask me HOW we managed to get the flag to the podium without dropping it! For what i found out later, all of us nearly dropped the flag!(jaws dropped) i can imagine the state flag floating down onto the floor...But thank God! It didn't happen! Later we got to wait for everyone to clear out before we can fall out. The people were really really inconsiderate! They stood there for aeons and took pictures of us as if we're some models or some statue in some exotic museum! Not that i'm not proud of my badges and my rank(erhmm, 2nd highest rank-Warrant Officer, and proud owner of 12 badges that's really important to me!) But my busted knee was giving me problem(sigh, like always!) It sort of give up on me sometime in between. it went numb....-_-''' and in the end, i can't fall out. Sigh! After that i changed into my kebaya, and parade around the school and events happened. Many photos taken and i'm in it! hahahaha! first time i would volunteer to be in the picture! Sheesh! Then i went over to pass leon his present. He messaged me saying that he liked the present. i hope it's true and all the best for his party tomorrow! I went home after that, meeting one of my fellow sec 3 flag bearer. We chatted all the way home, on the bus, on the way to the mrt station, on the mrt until i left the train. Hahaha! soo much to talk about! Anywayz, i ended up walking a little distance with my form teacher, Mrs Thong. She's alright, but i felt rather uncomfortable talking to her.:P Sorry! Hehehe! I got home in the end(obviously!) I missed all the fun, i got invited to go to watch a video, but i didn't go because my mom flared her temper at me (like always) and wanted me to go back home for lunch. Apparently it didn't appease her anger, she screamed at me. Now, i'm always in my room, i don't like to stay downstairs. I really envy those people who can talk about anything under the sun with their mother. Although i know it's partly my fault that they can't talk to me, i'm just not one who will open up to anyone. I like to keep some stuff to myself. I don't like to leave myself open for everyone's viewing. Sigh! I can't convey things to my mom, i can'ta talk to her, i don't like the way she always brings up prelims when i'm trying to get my mind of studying for a little while. That's why i always lock myself up in my room and read storybooks to relax, keep myself sane. It's true, no one can go through a long period of time without crying, and stuff, but i hadn't been crying for 2 weeks(and i'm planning to keep up on it.) No way am i going to break down during this period of time, and no way am i going to be sick! It's kind of a motivation for me, typing all this. This kept me, well, me. Like what Simon said, there's no real friends around him. Indeed, but it's not him, it's me. There's no true friends around, and i'm always putting a face up, a face that i find hard to remove after a few months. A face that i don't even recognise.  *Death is the only inescapable, unaviodable, sure thing. We are sentenced to die the day we're born.           -Gary Mark Gilmore-*  Peace out.

       Cool! Guess what? tomorrow's National Day celebrations! Hahaha! no school just PARTY all day! Get up and party!!! We get to wear different ethnic costumes. Nice huh? As i previously typed, i'm gonna wear a baju kurong...It's nice, but i bet it won't look good on me. I'm going to march early in the morn(Thanks ma'am Sarah, for lending me your rank! *My rank is out of stock...-_-'''*) Hope we all did good. God look over us and don't let us do some stupid mistake in front of the whole school!    I'm going to go get Leon's present today, though he asked me to go for his party(that's really sweet of him), but i can't go, i doubt i can go anyway. Guess i'll get him a spiderman 2 soundtrack cd. Don't know if he'll like it, but whatever, it's a present right? (and it's $18.90!) not cheap. Hahaha!    Yesterday i had the best night! I slept at 9.30pm! early huh? but i still get up this morning! =X Oops!(Sorry mom, got to let you climb up and down the stairs, screaming at the top of your lungs trying to get us down!:P) How lazy can i get? Heehee. Today's quite relaxing. Nothing much, just lab after lab. BUT i got to climb the stairs...O_o''' I hate it, it's not that i hate sports, or anything strenuous but my knee's getting on my nerves. It's hurting again, and so is my pelvis. I'm not joking...it's the right side. How am i supposed to get well? i want to be well when i get to JC. i don't want others to think i'm some weakling! Uh-uh! No way! I'm going to be one of the sportiest and one of the most outgoing person! (Okie, i'm boosting my own morale...heehee! so thick-skinned!)    Hope tomorrow goes well, i'll keep my fingers crossed and hopefully, with God's help, everything will be grand!!

        Hey, today's a tough day for me. Trying to cramp everything into my brain, dumb bio test. We're supposed to study the WHOLE BOOK! Gosh! Sigh! I can't really sleep last night, maybe i did but i can't remember. But now, it's over! YAY!! hahaha! But my head's still throbbing...O_o'''    Worrying our heads off, we sec 4s nearly strangled the sec 3s today, during assembly. As you should know, last year, thanks to SARS, we could not go to OBS. Sooo this year, the Sec 3s decided to dig into it. They started crapping about how nice it was(though it sounded boring to me, the way the said it). Reminds me of one who stab a person and twist the knife rather slowly and enjoy every single second of it. Yea, that's how the sec 3s are. After the looonnnggg, boring talk. The head prefect decided to do the most irritating thing of all-a cheer...-_-''' I mean, can't they be more sensitive? We, sec 4s, most of us were worrying our heads off for our coming bio test(it's after school hours) and THEY decided to take our LUNCHTIME and do a DUMB CHEER! Ya, i know it's all for next week's cross-country and stuff but isn't it too soon? We decided to just stone there and yea, not do anything. Hahaha! the head prefect was soo pissed off!(",)V So bittersweet! Hahaha!    The bio test was a terrible mess! i fell asleep(for a minute) in the middle of the paper! Sheesh! I hope, really do, that i can pass though i know i can't get flying colours. Yea, i totally freaked out when i got the paper. I better go back and study, always lack of time to study.   National Day's coming and NDP celebration's on this friday. Great! and i'm the flag bearer. Not that i don't like it, i'm just tired of all this stuff. My knee's throbbing too. And it's cranky. I get to wear a baju kurong. (Thanks ash! Though the 2nd button's gone..)Cool huh? After the march-in with state flag of course!(i'm supposed to be in full uniform...sigh!) And i get to wear heels!(Thanks Mel for lending me ur heels!) Duh, obviously i'm too short and the baju kurong is just a little too long...it's maroon in colour and i can wear all my necklace and earrings~ hahaha! i sound like some pathetic little girl, going to play dress up! Dotx! Hahaha! hmm, better get going i wanna go take a bath before coming down for dinner...

        Yoyo! Managed to sneak online, though i'm not supposed to! Hmm, i'm sick! Darn, gastric AND flu! How unlucky can one get? *Sigh*    I read Simon's blog today(sorry if i got to add some stuff here, no offence Simon!)   Whatever happens(i shan't mention, to keep one's privacy!), we just got to make sure we live life to its fullest, NEVER half-full. I learnt that after 2 friends left and we lost all contact(though i found one!:P) I really think back, what have i done today? Did i do what i think i should do? Did i do anything wrong? I'll make sure i pray for everyone tonight. Really, no kidding! Some people probably think that everything is nothing. Just something to lean on, but faith is always important. Faith in yourself, and faith in others. I know my English is horrible(Pardon me, my brain's not working!) but i don't know how to describe what i feel.     Went to see the doc today. My knee and my flu. 2 doctors in a day!(Man! what happened to the an apple a day keeps the doc away? I ate a banana!) My knee's still the same, no change, i hate it. It still hurts like hell and the doc pressed on it. (It's this electric shock feeling. But it hurts!) Maybe i'm just,u know, lousy, can't take the pain. U must also remember that throbbing knees give u bad moods! Bwahahaha! But i'm not that horrible! I got MC til the end of the year! Hahaha! what can i do? It's funny. AND i'm being lame, AGAIN! what's wrong with me? Sigh!       Guess i better go sleep. The drowsy med is getting on my nerves and throat's aching like no one's business! sheesh! Nitex!
