        urlLink    First photo of Egypt: The Great Pyramid of Cheops on the left, the Pyramid of Khefren on the right, and a Dromedary in the middle.     urlLink    If this guy saw me take his picture, I guarantee I'd be charged at least 30 EGP.      urlLink    The Great Pyramid, un-encased.      urlLink    Sphinx and Pyramid. Postcard anyone?      urlLink    The obligatory touristy shot. ...this one was not my idea.      urlLink    The colored lights of Cairo nights: on a boat on the Nile, passing another boat with similar fluorescent-rainbow lighting.      urlLink    First photo of Alexandria! What a relief it was to visit this breezy coastal city, especially as it was right at sundown on the only day I observed the fast of Ramadan.      urlLink    Top Gym. For bigger bodies and smaller craniums. At an Alexandria near you.      urlLink    The view from the balcony (yes, Balcony!) in our Alexandria Hotel. Our room, if I remember correctly, cost roughly 30 EGP/ night. This translates into Â£3.00, and it was the best hired accomodation of the trip.      urlLink    Too cool for Cairo.      urlLink    Ah, the Cecil! Home of many a mirror-world meeting.      urlLink    The mirror in which Darley met Justine...      urlLink    The Temple of Luxor. (This is funny because "Luxor" comes from the Arabic "Al-Uqsar," meaning "The Palaces." The Temple of Luxor, then, nonsensically means "The Temple of Palaces.")      urlLink    More of the Temple of Luxor.      urlLink    The Temple of Hatshepsut in the Valley of the Queens across the river from Luxor.      urlLink    Hieroglyphs in Hatshepsut's temple.      urlLink    Stark scenery of the Temple of Hatshepsut     urlLink    Competition was fierce at this year's contest...      urlLink    Peakaboo: I see Hatshepsut-Hathor!      urlLink    Amazingly preserved hierogylphics--check out the color!      urlLink    The Colossi of Memnon outside the Valley of the Kings near Luxor.      urlLink    The afternoon sun over the Nile from a posh hotel in Luxor.      urlLink    Nothing compares to the sight of the sun setting slowly over the Nile, a felucca darting in and out of the flame, while drinking Chai 'Annan (Mint Tea) after an exhausting day. Nothing.      urlLink    On the last trip of the trip: a first-class sleeper journey from Luxor to Cairo. Theoretically two days from home, but realistically miles from anywhere...&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Here are some of the cherry blossoms that line many of the paths through The Meadows.  These ones are along Jawbone Walk.  Boy I love spring, especially when it soon leads to summer.&nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink    On my recent trip home, I was lucky enough to attend the wedding of two of my friends from Denison, Kara and Katie, above.  Don't they look so happy?  These pictures are from immediately after the ceremony and include many from Denison.     urlLink    Here they are again, this time posing for somebody else's picture.     urlLink    Katie with her mother.     urlLink    Some people don't like their pictures taken...     urlLink    But I got her this time.  Nancy, Rachel, and Hydy.     urlLink    Sarah and Debbie     urlLink    And here she is again!  The little shutterbug...     urlLink    Just two seconds too late... Here are Lisa and Sarah.     urlLink    Sarah again, tripod provided by Nancy.     urlLink    The Best Cake Ever.     urlLink    Debbie, Rob, and Sage (and a dozen other people) throw around the ol' disc.     urlLink    A bit of clever cropping, and you can hardly tell we have no idea where the camera is aimed.     urlLink    What?  What's this?  Someone's been sitting in my tonka toy, and here she is!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I was able to visit my high school buddy Stephanie while I was home to cook a meal for her and her husband Joe.  They showed me around their new, beautiful home, and I also had the pleasure of meeting the addition to the household, their bouncing baby, Zachary.  Right now he's working on focusing on individual people, but I'm sure he'll soon learn to do the dishes, take out the trash, mow the lawn, rake the leaves, resurface the driveway...     urlLink    A little bit of father-son bonding.    urlLink    And then there were three.  Ah, look at those smiles of pre-toddler bliss.&nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink    As always happens when it rains a lot with little down-time between rains, our yard flooded and spilled over the driveway.  To think we used to swim in that when we were younger... that water's nasty!     urlLink    This is just a closeup of the cherry tree... for something different.  I think I might use it as a background for my desktop.     urlLink    Cherries ripe for the pickin' on a tree in our yard.     urlLink    And fresh strawberries, too!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    A Delta gypsy moth trap placed by my sister Jackie.  One of the things she's doing this summer is working with the state to track these bugs' migration.  And -- I'm embarassed to admit this -- it's actually quite fun!&nbsp; urlLink
