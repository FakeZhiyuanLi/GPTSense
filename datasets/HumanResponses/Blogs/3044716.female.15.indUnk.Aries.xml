      Haiz...didn't blog 4 the last few daes becos i gt too much work to do. Homework after homework &amp; test after test.So sad :(  Monday: Gt performances during the two recesses n is quite gd (i tink so) . The lower sec. is more supportive than the upper sec. During band ms xia came n when i wan to tell her to test kenny whether to let him change instrument , she left n mr ong came. If i ask him, he will sure let him change so better not. we need to bring home our instrument n is sososos heavy. I need to study for two test n is chinese n amath. ((I am so stress wif all the test!!!))  Tuesday: Woke up feeling so stress. We will be having chinese test first than amath after school. The amath test was so difficuit n worse is i did not finish the paper. After the test , peiqi cried becos she oso did not finish the paper. Than we went for the IT course, the teacher ask why we were late n they oso did not have enough com. to go around.They did not teach anytink but wan us to complete on our project.After tat we ( huili,Jingfeng,sharon,bing xiong n weiwei) went to mac to have a bite.Then went home to do hw.  Wednesday: Nothing really happened on tat dae. After school , we (huili,peiqi,kimkim,sharon n siew hiang) went to LJS to have our lunch n i felt tat huili, sharon n siew hiang were abit odd.Then we went to library to return n borrow bks. After tat, we all went home.  Thursday: Today nothing happen in school. I have lunch wif peiqi at the coffeeshop than we went home. Then i was blogging now.Later prepare to finish my amath hw. Tml will be having fun fair at school.
