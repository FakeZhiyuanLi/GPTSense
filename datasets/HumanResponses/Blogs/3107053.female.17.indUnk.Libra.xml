      Today I walked down Silver Avenue in that haphazard, care free sort of way that can only be walked by someone who is uncooked.  I was feeling a bit blue, so I made a conscious effort to brighten up the day.  Little did I know that the next stranger I bumped into would eventually change my life.  You see, I was just taking a nice little stroll down a shady little street where the Dutch Elm trees sort of reached over the fences of their yards and tickled the sidewalk with their long droppy boughs, when out of the shady green leaves popped the funniest young man I had ever seen.  He was a sharp looking character, I'll give you that, dressed up real snazy like he was out to a party - decked out in his black jacket and wide white collar.  But the most peculiar thing about him was this hat he was wearing.  Now the make of that hat was not that unusual, all be it outdated.  It was a fine felt fedora with a fine satin band around it, but its colour was the thing that really tickled me.  Not so much its colour, either, as its pattern.  I mean, who in their right mind would be wearing a traffic-sign-orange plaid fedora with a classy black suit and shiny black shoes in the middle of Winnipeg?    So upon awkwardly bumping into this peculiar man, I thought to myself, "Well this is far too rich an encounter to pass up."  So I sort of gestured to the man and his hat and kind of asked what sort of notion had been put into his head when he bought such an outrageous luxery item.  And I called it a luxery item because it certainly was not a neccesity, seeing as it was June and 28 degrees outside with a relative hummidity of 80%, who would be wearing a felt fedora?  Well, the young man simply grinned the aloof grin of someone who is uncooked and casually answered, It's a conversation piece.  And what a piece it was.  As it turned out, this man and I were both heading to the park for music and fireworks.  Offering me his well-outfitted arm, we both took to that casual sort of stroll belonging only to those who are uncooked and continued the day's festivities with fantastic conversation.

      What has it been now, Romeo, a year, two?  Something like that.  My how time flies when you're having fun, but I've been thinking:  Will I always be this devoted/infatuated/swooned?  In my past experienced I remember this emtional high, this period of sheer bliss and captivation, but that all fades.  Doesn't it?  Unless by some God given gift we fit together, aren't we still doomed like all the other blooming adults out there?  Today I was watching you when you didn't see me, and I could not imagine a time or a place where I would not be attracted to you.  But what if this is the climax before the start of a very long downward sprial.
