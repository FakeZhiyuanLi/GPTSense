						   Well I know I need to do this daily.  Here's wjat's been going on with me since the last time I posted.  I have two people I consider friends hashing it out with one another in the Enterprise NG and another friend who can't see that she's being used.  I've tried to ease both problems and made very little progress but at least I tried.  I've learned the hard way you can only do so much to effect things going on around you.  This is especially true with people around you.  The best you can do is be there for your friends when they need you. It's a hard thing to do but it's what you have to.  On a lighter note I've had a real good time in Chat the last couple of nights.  There is nothing like the give n take of a chat channel like #stngs and #SciFi+ of course the mods are the main reason everything stays cool.  Thanks Wickeddoll in #stngs and Sexy Ninja and others in #SciFi+ for keeping thing drama free.  Well that's all for now, I won't make any promises about when I get back to post again but I will try to make it tomorrow.

						   Well I missed posting yesterday, but nothing much happen that's worth talking about. Today I hung around the enterprise ng and the #SciFi+ . I need to have a private chat with Kai to tell him I will not discuss what happens in #stngs on another channel.  Tomorrow off to try to get food stamps!

						   Well I took a walk around my Yard today to snap some pictures and spent more time than usual processing them.  The turned out pretty good.  I also spent too much time napping. I've got to get on the stick and exersize more.  It's funny how things that you think you gotten over sudden come back to you.  Last night all my feelings about Kathy aka Shygal came out in a dream.  My it was something that need to happen and I'm glad it did.  Maybe what I went thorugh with here a three years ago is finally purged from me.  I didn't realize the hurt and anger was still there.  So maybe my recent heart attack had something to do with it.  I've started on season 1 of Enterprise and hopely by next weekend I have most of that downloaded.  I burned season 3 except for the most recent ones to normal CD-R's so I can reused my cd-rw's for season one and two.  Ya tomorrow!

Did my review for the latest episode of Star Trek:Enterprise and posted it in alt.tv.star-trek.enterprise.  Been feeling much better and I have almost got caught up on Enterprise's third season or Series 3 for those outside the USA.  I know I need to get outside more and walk or at least use that exercise walker I found and I will do that starting in the morning.  Well see ya tomorrow night take care everyone.

						   Well over the last couple of days I've heard from some old web tv buddies and have been posting in a usnet group for webbers and former webbers.  Things in my old haunts of Alt.discuss haven't been pleasent it appears to be worse than the BC wars I went though.  Overall though I've got some good memories of webbie and that want change.  I've updated my Website Riverton Common the news section is now more polished and the photo section has been two.  The site looks great and I'm hoping that soon I will be getting a lot of vistors.  Well that's all for to night.
