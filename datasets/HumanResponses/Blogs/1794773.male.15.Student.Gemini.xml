Erica i really dont wanna stop you from goin to cedar point with poms though. We really all need to get together soon if we wanna work out plans and have a movie night. About that.

      rach I think thats a great idea. I guess I don't have to go with poms. I'm not even sure if we're going. but we will need to make plans for that real soon. like when and how we'll get there. I'm not sure if it will all work out but I think it will be really fun. so krista or rachael or anyone who hasnt had a movie night I think we should have one real soon. just pick a day any day is fine for me. cuz we sure have lots and lots to talk about.   LOVE, Erica.

      Ok guys, I have an idea. Maybe we should all get together and go to Cedar Point!! Becca, Kristin, and I didnt exactly have the best time last time we went. It's just an idea though. I wanna go on all of the rides that i missed last time. If you guys agree or wanna do it just write back or call me and maybe we can work out a plan. Ah Erica you are going with poms though. We can talk about that later. I really wanna talk to you guys! I miss you a lot. Love, Rach

            OMG guys. Orlando was soooo awesome. I'm so glad that I saw all of u there except Carissa... what happened to you. I dunno maybe I'm  just blind. but the Relient K concert was so much fun. They are soo good. Me and Maryel and other peace ppl were in the front row. I mean front and center it was so awesome. but it got kinda crazy cuz everyone was jumping and it was so futching hot and I was so sweating and on top of that everyone was pushing us and then we fell over. but other then that it was really fun.          I have more to say but I can't think of it right now. and we really need to have a movie night really soon b4 school starts cuz we have alot of things we need to talk about.

      Hey girls, sorry i didn't write for a really really long time. Orlando was so futching awesome!!! i'm so glad i saw most of y'all. we saw some mighty fine men down there. ;) i have lots of good stories too so lets have a sleepover. and i hate how we always say we are gonna hang out and never do so we need to stop doing that. love you all!!!

      Ok so Orlando was the best thing ever! I had such an awesome experience and i have SO many stories to tell. Krista, whens the movie night? I thought everything was so cool there, and it worked out great. Our hotel was super super awesome! Erica im so sorry i didnt call you on the last night. I was out in the lobby till like 3. I hated that one skit though about the v space crap. Omg if you guys heard someone say: yeah!!" a bunch of times, that was lil old Micah. lol. Jen left for California today. I think that was one of the hardest things to do, say goodbye to her. When i got on our shuttle bus after i said goodbye, all the guys were just looking at me. I could tell they didnt know what to say. Steve Morrill is so extremely nice though.  Oh and im just feeling like crap. You guys, i have never felt this way ever before. I hate it with a passion. I am not going to write it online though. I just feel like my world is going to end tomorrow. I dunno ill talk to you about it later. Im glad i got to see you all in Orlando though!! I made sure to see all of you. I love you guys! Love, Rachael P.S.~ did i mention that orlando was freaking awesome? it sucks to be in Saginaw now. It went by so fast.

      ORLANDO IS TOMORROW!!!! Oh am I ever so excited. Well here are some random things. No let me say&nbsp;REALLY random things..... We all (the&nbsp; pajama gang) need to get a picture where we are all in a circle with our heads looking down and the person taking the picture is underneath us. Trust me its the coolest thing. People have done it in poms. and another random thing...... Well, you know how my brother walks funny with his bounce.... well I think its hereditery or whatever its called (in the genes) because I just found out that my Uncle and cousin both walk the same way (with the bounce). Hehe. I just thought that was really funny and that I'd let u all know that. Well there is a Michigan dinner or something in Orlando so maybe we'll see each other there. Who knows???&nbsp;&nbsp; Love you all bunches.

      Ok guys, my group is going to the lunch thing for the Michigan District thing too! Oh and if you are looking for my group, on 1 of the 7 days, we will be wearing Orange tee shirts, and im gonna have an orange bandana on and orange tube socks!!! So look for the weird girl in all orange. Omg you guys, my brother found our website and hes threatening me that hes gonna look at it! I totally freaked out! AHH!! Hopefully my dad threatens him if ya know what i mean lol. Ok Orlando so far is going great!! Omg my youth leader left a couple of days ago for Orlando, and his flight got cancelled and delayed 2ce!! He said that most of the Northwest Airlines will be cancelled or delayed at least once! So maybe tomorrow wont be the best, but im sure ill have fun. I'm looking so forward to this trip. I really am gonna make an effort to find you guys! I love you guys so much! Love,&nbsp; Rach

      so I went to see Sleepover with Maryel yesterday and that was like the best movie ever. I mean it was so funny and very cute. I thought it was gonna be very stupid and cheesy, but it was awesome. Me and Maryel were laughing through the whole thing but I don't think anyone else thought it was but it was fun.&nbsp; Oh yea and another plus is that the main guy in it sooooooo frickin hot I couldn't stand it. So I just wanted to recommend that movie to all of you. and i would see it again if anyone wants to go see it after Orlando. or we could see a different movie if you want cuz there are tons of good movies out there. and I really miss you guys so maybe we could all get together after Orlando and do something. I dunno.... just a thought. Love, Erica

I really hope you guys come to the dances at our hotel so we can hang out and take some lil pictures!! hehe! I finally got a tanline this summer, lol. Yes, that makes me proud.lol. I hope that you guys are safe in Orlando if i dont see you!! I'll look for you guys out of the 35,000 ppl at the convention center!! Love, Rach

      since I'm gonna be with Maryel the whole time at Orlando, you guys can call her cell whenever you want cuz she'll have it on her at all times. so her # is 284-2280. so if you want to get together and do something (any of you) just call and we can go from there. I'm so excited for Orlando only 2 more days.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love, Erica

       ohhh Erica that sucks! I wonder why he still likes Nicole though. I mean he's been gone all summer anyways. I wouldn't give up if i were you though. He needs to see what a great person you are!! :) You and I should hang out sometime. Like Wednesday or something, we should go and see A Cinderella Story or something!!! I am so so so pumped for Orlando guys.  &nbsp;Ok guys, i was hanging out with Jen the other day, and i couldnt help but noticing of how much she talked about mullet. I dunno maybe it was just me. I CANT stop thinking about if i like him or not. I know once i see him im gonna start all over again. I really just wanna say something, but im soo afraid that hes gonna laugh. What do you guys think i should do? Hey brit, i havent talked to you in forever!! lol sorry guys that was random. Well if anyone wants to hang out, seriously call me! I'm up for anything. Love, Rach &nbsp;

Hey guys on Sunday July 18th my church is having&nbsp; a car wash to raise money! If you wanna continue being friends with me you should come. JK!! But if you need a car wash you guys can stop by. Oh, and i dont think i like mullet anymore. But, once i see him i prolly will. I hate this so much, seriously. That is what my dreams are about. I gotta go though. Much love, Rach

Everyone, if you see Jen at Orlando,&nbsp; make sure you give her a hug, because right now is her last week in Michigan. I think she might be having a hard time. Just to let you know.

Ahh Becca i dont have a cell phone or i would tell you it. I wish there was another way we could keep in contact. :(.&nbsp; We also need to have another movie night in August. Krista, if you wanna do yours just tell me. If not, I'd be happy to have one at my house. OMG KRISTA,&nbsp; i think i left some of my brothers movies in your van on the way back from Kristin's, because i dont have them here and my brother is gettin a lil angry. Just write me back or call me. I really wanna hang out with you guys!

       I am really bored. I'm actually kinda excited for school to start back up. but i'm not looking forward to the homework part. Now that always sucks. Is Nicole gonna have a movie night?? cuz I really want her to. i'm actually excited for the scary movies. hehe. but i dont think that it would be a good idea if the guys came over (luke and dave) not only cuz most of us wouldnt have anyone to hold onto, but because it might be a little wierd having guys coming to our movie nights. I say lets keep it to girls only. I think we should have movie nights every night. hehe jk. well thats it. love you all bunches and bunches. toodles.

      Rach... I'm glad you chose what you wanted to do. i think you made the right decision and don't worry I'm behind you in your decision. oh yeah and i think i left my camera at your house so i dont know when you can get that back to me. i probly wont be seeing you till school starts so thats fine if you get it back to me then. About Cedar Point... i dont think that will work out cuz everything is so crazy and we wont be able to set a date. so maybe next summer we can do that.

          Hi Rach!!!  I'm glad you went with your gut and did what you thought was best.  I'm proud of you.  I luv ya bunches!!!  Um... I don't know what you mean by needing a deal for Cedar Point.  But I know Dennis Weiss and Jake Petzold were kind of planning a trip to Cedar Point too.  I mean, we don't have to hang out with them the whole time, but if it's cheaper to have 2 more people then i guess we could ask them.  I don't really know what's going on I'm just stating some stuff than I know.  Okay, luv luv   Brittany Lou

       I HATE CHOOSING!!!! I'm not doing basketball. I'll prolly regret it once or twice or more, but i think that i dont like it anymore. Carissa and I talked for awhile, and she told me that i should go for what my gut says. So I am. I really would appreciate it if you guys wouldnt like be on top of me and asking me why i didnt go out, because im a horrible wreck right now. You all know how hard it is for me to make decisions. Oh and i dunno if the cedar point thing is gonna work out, becuase Bill and Micah come back the 19th, so they wouldnt be able to give us a deal. I dunno what you guys wanna do though. Just call me or something, because i need friends right now. lol. Love, Rach

            That's so cool, Carissa!!!  Aren't they the ones you were praying for in Algebra all the time?  Well, I'm very happy for Scott and Judy.    I'm so sad that you might not be able to come... but that's still a maybe right?  So you might be able to come.  We were maybe thinking about not making it scary movie night... so I don't know.  If we have just a regular ole happy night we can watch the scary movies later.   Oh, but then Rachael would actually be able to come and we'd watch scary stuff  Oh Shoot!!!  I don't know.  I'll let Nicole figure all this out.  It's her party.  We still have to invite Krista, Becca, and Kristin.  Geesh!!!    Okay, Rachael's was really fun!!!  I am so tired right now.  We got back from church and I just wanted to crash on the couch and sleep.  Carissa or Kristin when is our first practice???  I really don't want to miss it.     Okay I've written enough.  It's gonna take all day to publish this bad boy.  Luv ya guys!!!

      hello again to all my friends. im glad you came to play. the fun and learning never ends. here's what we learned today:

-when you have a choice between going camping with your family and going to rachael's house, you should probly pick your family but it sucks

-richville is a lonely place to live

-i miss my friends

-summer should be twice as long as it is

-most guys write really short e-mails and i dont like it

-Nicole still isn't part of this blog

love you all, hope you had fun at rachael's

       Alright! i guess if Becca can't go to the movie night, I'll still have it because i know everyone is excited.That will only be 5 ppl though. I dunno. Someone call me or something and talk to me about it. I have bandanas too Erica, if you dont wanna bring yours. Yes, we should talk about Cedar Point. That would be awesome to go, it would kinda be like the last summer  thing with our Pajama Gang! I'm thinkin i might rent: Confessions of...., 13 going on 30, and if the Prince and Me is out too. How does that sound? I'm so excited!! Love, Rach

      Alright, so far I am having my movie night. Becca is supposed to call me today and tell me if she can or not. If she can't, i dunno if ill have one then. If i do, BRING MOVIES! I only have like 1 that we could watch. If we haven't seen them, or they are new, just bring em right over. You guys can prolly come over anytime after 11:00 AM. On Saturday you guys can stay as long as you want. If ya wanna bring anything else, you can. I'm so sorry we don't have a pool or anything. :( . Call me if you want to know anything! Brittany, I got your message. I'm so glad your coming!! Oh! and bring your pictures if you have them from Orlando. I'm thinkin we should all take turns and just tell all of our stories without any interruptions. How does that sound? Love, Rarch

      Ok where is everyone? WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND PLAN WHAT WE ARE GONNA DO. like movie nights or cedar point, that kinda stuff. Just call eachother and plan a lil somethin. Ok, if Krista doesnt have her movie night this week, i prolly will. So someone inform me when krista is having one. K? I got my pictures back a few days ago already and half of them didnt turn out. I really wanted some with all of the guys ( wink wink) lol. I am so angry that my whole week there, i didnt get any with them. That was practically my  last chance too. Oh well. Love, RAch

            Hi guys!!!!  Orlando was soooo much fun!!!  I think I saw just about everyone except Becca... i saw your brother and a bunch of people from your group, but not you... Oh well, I'll see you at school or at a movie night if we do get around to having one.  Did you all have a great time?  I'm really really sad about Jenn leaving... I'm gonna miss her.  I'm glad I got to see her in Florida though to say good bye.     Yeah, that V Space thing was kind of retarded.  I didn't understand any of it.  And when she was in the hospital and she was almost dead it looked like they brought her back to life with mustard!!!  It was just too weird for me.  Well, I guess I'll talk to you guys later.  luvluv    Brittany Lou
