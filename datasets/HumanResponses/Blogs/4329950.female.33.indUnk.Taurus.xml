      Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a genetically inherited disorder which causes congenital blindness or very severe visual impairment. The genes causing LCA are many, each involving different physiological processes, but all concerning the retina's photoreceptors, or the retinal pigment epithelium. Vision in LCA ranges from total blindness to low vision. It is generally diagnosed in the first few months of life. Currently 6 genes responsible for LCA have been identified, and researchers think at least as many are there to be discovered.  In some forms of LCA, the retinas don't develop correctly; in others, the photoreceptors gradually degenerate; in other types the retina remains intact, photoreceptors are healthy but don't function properly ( urlLink Koenekoop 2004 ).  THE FUTURE: LCA MAY BE TREATED!  LCA is the most severe form of congenital blindness, yet recent studies have demonstrated that it may be one of those conditions amenable for treatment. Since it usually only affects the outer layers of the person's retinas, and the rest of the visual pathway seems to remain intact, even in adult subjects, vision may be restored - at least in selected LCA patients.  Possible future treatments include:  1. GENE THERAPY: in simple terms - I'm not a doctor! - gene therapy aims at replacing a person's faulty gene with a healthy one. The genetic material is introduced into the body by means of a virus (a good virus), which once in the body starts to replicate and spreads the good genes to the target cells. In 2001, researchers at Cornell University restored vision in dogs affected by a form of LCA caused by a mutation in the RPE65 gene ( urlLink Acland 2001 ). This proved that gene therapy does work for at least one form of LCA. Clinical trials on humans carrying the RPE65 mutation are planned for as early as 2005. If gene therapy proves successful it is very likely that it can be extended to patients carrying different LCA mutations.  urlLink Click here  to view a recent, very clear and comprehensive explanation of gene therapy and its prospects for LCA and other retinal diseases, by the Foundation Fighting Blindness.  2. RETINAL CELL TRANSPLANTATION: since LCA affects the photoreceptors of the retina (rods and cones, cells which transform light into visual impulses) or the retinal pigment epithelium (the outermost layer of the retina which is essential for photoreceptor nourishment and maintenance) usually leaving the rest of the visual pathway intact, vision may be restored by replacing the faulty cells with healthy ones, from healthy donors or stem cells. Various trials on animal models have shown that transplanted cells do survive indefinitely, and that to a certain extent they form synapses (they build a contact) with the rest of the retina. Researchers now have to find ways to improve synapses, which will allow the brain to receive clear information from the retina. This is challenging, but very thrilling, as such a procedure has the potential to restore vision to a blind eye affected by most retinal diseases.  3. PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY: for some types of LCA where the retinas remain intact and photoreceptors don't die - though they don't function properly - drugs may be developed which can slow or even reverse the problem. Currently, to my knowledge, researchers are trying to develop such a drug for LCA1 (LCA caused by mutations in the photoreceptor specific retinal guanylate cyclase gene GUCY2D), using a mouse model (Perrault 2003).  4. ARTIFICIAL RETINA: in many laboatories around the world, researchers have been working  for years at the development of an artificial retina, or retinal chip, which will act as the person's lost or malfunctioning photoreceptors and turn light into visual impulses sent to the brain. Each lab is using a different technique: some implants work with solar energy, others require batteries and a camera linked to a pair of glasses. Some are positioned on top of the retina, others under the outer layer. Human trials have been going on for a few years, and though final results are not yet known, it has been established that the implants are safe and cause no damage to the patient. Projects currently underway include:   urlLink Artificial Silicon Retina    urlLink The Boston Retinal Implant Project    urlLink Artificial Retina Project   IMPORTANT  Like I said, I'm not a doctor and the information provided may not be 100% scientifically accurate. I am a 33 year-old patient with LCA, and I constantly keep myself up-to-date with research, anxiously waiting for breakthroughs.  If you have any question, need information, or would like me to post something specific on this site, please email me using the contact link on this page and I'll get back to you asap. If you would like to post your comments or experiences with LCA on this site, just drop me an email and I'll be more than glad to consider it.

      Buongiorno a tutti! Sono Francesca, una ragazza italiana di 33 anni affetta dalla Amaurosi Congenita di Leber, LCA. Ho creato questo blog per diffondere e condividere informazioni utili su questa patologia. Tutte queste pagine sono in inglese – al fine di renderle accessibili al maggior numero possibile di visitatori – ma non esitate a contattarmi per email usando questo  urlLink modulo  e sarò felice di rispondervi in italiano.  In Italia esiste un’associazione no-profit che riunisce pazienti con LCA e le loro famiglie, denominata IALCA (Italian Association LCA), creata nel 1999 con sede a Pavia. La funzione dell’Associazione è quella di diffondere informazioni sempre aggiornate sulla patologia e di promuovere la ricerca, inviando campioni di sangue dei pazienti ai laboratori preposti e aiutando le famiglie a mantenere rapporti diretti con essi.  urlLink Clicca qui  per visualizzare il sito della IALCA, per contattarli, o per dare un contributo.  Un altro sito italiano interessante e informativo sulla LCA è quello dedicato a  urlLink Matteo , un bambino fantastico e travolgente, affetto da LCA di tipo 1.  Cari saluti a tutti  Francesca - Parma

      Hope for a cure for Leber’s congenital amaurosis LCA is becoming more and more realistic, and may not be too far ahead, at least for some forms of the disease. Since LCA is a collective name for very different retinal conditions, treatments will probably need to be disease-type specific. The type of LCA is determined by the genetic mutation the patient carries. It’s therefore important that THE blood of the patients is analyzed in order to find out which gene is defective.  If you have been diagnosed with LCA, you  should consider giving a blood sample to labs specialized in genetic testing for two reasons:  1.	If you still haven't been tested for the six LCA genes known so far, the test will reveal if you do carry one of them.  2.	If the six LCA genes are ruled out in your case, your blood will be further studied in order to determine the gene responsible for your disorder, which will benefit both you and the entire LCA community.  SPECIALIZED LABS  LCA is a rare disorder, and only specialized labs so far are concerned with it. The number is growing and they are scattered all over the world. What follows is a link of researchers you may want to contact to have more information. Some labs may only perform genetic testing of the known genes, while others are also carrying out research. Also, some may require a fee, while others may offer it for free. Please contact them and ask, or  urlLink email me  and I will see if I can help. Please note that this list is not comprehensive and there may be many other labs involved with LCA that I don’t know of.

      Researchers from Paris have just announced the discovery of another gene causing Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis!!  It is the photoreceptor-specific RDH12 gene. All patients carrying RDH12 mutations seem to exhibit a severe, progressive rod-cone dystrophy with severe macular atrophy.  Another exciting step forward toward future treatments!   urlLink Click here  for the abstract of the article published this month
