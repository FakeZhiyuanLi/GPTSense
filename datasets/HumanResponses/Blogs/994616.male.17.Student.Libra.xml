       urlLink mental garage (she's nubs)  I dont know WHy nit automatically links to the page im what while im blogging but i guess it does give some insite into the sites that i visit.  I am so glad that i finally -almost-finished my art major work. i just have to edit some video pick up some prints get nekkid and im done. It's great. ofcourse starting next week life = groupwork. Mr O. helped us more in 3 lessons than Mr Baines did in weeks, just shows who's the better... urm... thing.  To rewardmyself for all the art effort i've been doing i bought myself minority report... well.. almost. i bought a DVD that has it on it; Minority Report thus bringing my  dvd collection to a taggering 8 dvds.  Im going to try to get a better comments thingo, im going to see if enetations will work for me now, they were lazy slackers before.  I jus realised even now that blogger and blogspot is working properly almost all the time people arent like yay, just goes to show how humans notice when things dont work not when they do.  Poison Mushroom to my brother for having lots of people over and making lots of noise last night  1up mushroom pokmemon cards i got some ruby and saffire ones!!! i rock!!!

      Ok, first i would like to apologise to caroline. I guess i never really understood what you meant when you said i devalued your emotion. i think i had to experiance it to understand it. the person who has been "miffing" me makes it sound like my concern is of no importance.  he makes it sound like its ok for him to ignore me because my form of attention seeking doesnt work on him any more. he makes me feel like my art is worse than jess like my thoughts arent as good as evan's like im not as good as luke.   further he has made me so incredibly self critical, everystatement i make, everything i write, every though i think gets analysed - was that an attempt for attention? what aproch for attention was that? why do i need attention? why do i need confirmation of my ideas opinions and thoughts?   even now...  1 up mushroom: drama IP its done, i like it  poison mushroom: i wonder.....

      Yeah yeah, i know i dont get it. and i know im not supposed to delete posts. however i have leniancy with that rule as long as it was writtten after 11:00 pm, or at some time whenm i am incredibly (or should that be incriminatingly?) tired.  I broke my dicman. it's times like these i wished i had an iPor,. or atleast a discman that wasnt crappy ie made by sony.  I saw   The Italian Job  tonight. Review:  The basic plot line was good. There wasn't enough character development. There was just enough for you to know that this personj loved that person etcetera. The revenge stuff wasn't that strong either.   the acting was average. the comic parts could have been delivered better too.  im pretty tired, so i think i will finish this review up with 2 monkeys out of 5  g'night

      Someone has been seriously pissing me off recently. Well thats a lie. He has been indifferent to me. Take that in both ways the sentence could be interpretted. ie he is acting indifferently to me and I have felt indifferent to him.  His indifferance has been seriously pissing me off though. There, that statement is more accurate. I think he has made the conscious decision that he is going to give me less attention (or negative attention) because I seek attention. However while this is going on he gives Luke Jess and Evan equal ammounts of attention while being an attention seeker himself. Does this seem cool to you? maybe i'm just bugging.

We aqlso went down the bush for a while. there was an onld rusty car there, which was amusing for about 13 seconds. We sat and chatted for a while, and decided that if were just sitting and chatting that we  could just do that at aaron's place.  We got to aaron's place and did what we said, sat and chatted.

      Y'know what i just thought, Even though it is currntly fashionable to be Bi, bi people aren't getting much media attention. I, personally, don't watch queer as folk, but im pretty sure that's a pure queer show. Then there is also Will and grace, another smash hit with either straight or queer people. and finally there is a new show - queer eye for teh straight guy. Again a smash hit and it focusing on ngay peoplel. Whats more is that lesbianism seems to have gone OUT of fashion. Ohwell, mi guess its not all that enthralling stuff it is just TV.

      Ok it's the flavor of the month to discuss Georgea and Erin's alcohol problems. Sure i would never go to school tips like they did, but fuck tis not that bad. They had no periods left so they weren't missing out on any thing. All they did was get drunk at school. Ok it sounds bad but lets break it down. They didnt have anything important to do, i don't think they hurt anyone (other than, possibly, themselves). MY brother's friends have done worse more often. They think it's terrible that she is drunk at school, which hurts no one, yet they think its funny that they steal countless things from school, break countless things at school. I am envious of them, I have never been all that good at breaking rules but erin does it all the time, and that is one of the reasons why she is so fun, because she is willing to do stuff. Finally what is the worst thing that could come of this a yell and a slap on the wrist, nothing terrible. I knwo i am just repeating myself again and again, and I apologise im just trying to think of the best way to explain it.   1 Up Shroom Ezza and George for doing something that i have always wanted to do  Poisoned Shroom Hypocrisy

        You're Minority Report.  Colin plays Danny, at first you hate him because he's so annoying, yet sexy, and then when he tries to help Tom Cruise he gets shot by an old man.  Even though he dies, he's still very sexy.

      Ok , as you all know, well none of you, but anyways i cant decided between brown and blue for my web page. i found a very cool script that would allow the visitor to choose, i would put it in the "Random blue rectangle" and then there would be a drop down menuy and you could choose, blue or brown. but it is far too confusing for me to impliment. I might figure it out when im bored.

      yay I did 2.5 hours of driving today! I'm hoping to do about 5 hours a week. That would mean 6 weeks untill Ps, and i forgot to go job hunting so theres even less chance now, but in the event of winning the lottery 28 weeks until minidom.  I just remembered part of the dream i had last night. all i remember is the part where i got 59 as my UAI. but that was ok because it was only the uai that i got for english so if i did good in the other parts then i could get a better uai. yes it was odd. yes i do enjoy penguins. no not in that way  1up: mini  Poisoned Shroom: for maing me go grocery shopping after itake a ritalin so i end up getting no work done

      I have had the most fantastic night since the hsc. It felt fresh when everything else in my life has felt stale. Me and Evan were planning to go to Pirates of the Caribbean. The fantastic evening started right from when we picked Evan up he was hypo - which is always good. We got there and Pirates was was sold out. At this point Ingrid and Tiffany ( I love the name Tiffany) turned up. They were seeing Legally Blonde 2 so Even and I saw that with them. It was another exponential comedy - started off not funny but by the end you were in stitches. Anyways Evan had told his parents to pick us up at 11 something but Legally Blonde went for an hour shorter than Pirates so Evan Ingrid Tiff and I chatted in the food court and it was HILARIOUS. All I can say is; badger b-bang kuh-jah and *slaps table* SEX! I think that was the best night I can remember. I made a conscious decision to write this before I read anyone else's blog because I KNOW that this good had to cause someone else something bad...  1up 'shroom: Evan, Tiff and Dingo, some truely great people.

I saw hollywood Homicide last night... it was ok. it was an exponential comedy ie it started off kinda meh ish but by the end you were chocking on noodles.. the acting was good. plot good. it wasnt great and it wasnt crap so that lands it squarly on 5 .  i always forget hopw good it feels to make other people laugh.   1 up shroom: CK for making such comfortable underwear *laughs at gropssed out look on carolines face*  Poisoned Shroom: fruit chews. its noisy opening each in-duh-vidual candy thing i was embarassed to hell so i opened as many as i could before the movie started.

      why does everyone have to have different taste to me. why doesnt anyone else like "i wrote this song" by monica or lets get retarded by the black eyed peas. they're great songs but i would never dream of recomending them to any of my friends. and its crap because listening to music i dont like puts me in a fucked up mood, especially loud music. i dont know what im going to go at schoolies right now i dont really feel like going. unless i have an ipod and noise counseling headfones. but that would cost me $2000 so its not going to happen  i've figured out that if i get a job and save mosty of my allowance i should be able to afford a mini. how roxxor is that. i looooove the new mini. they're dead sexy.   1 up shroom: bmw for designing such a sexy mini  Poison Shroom: all my friends for their terrible taste in music, and for always maiing me feel shit about my taste in music

      Ok because Bloggers not working Im writing this in word and will post it later, so you could be reading a stale (possibly mouldy) blog.  Id just like to say that My Little Eye is freaky. With horror movie I get to terrified pretty quickly but it takes a lot to get me to fucking terrified and this movie failed. I mean it was scary and it was scarier than the ring but I mean its still a movie maybe its just that Im reflecting it was pretty gross in the cinema. The acting wasnt bad if a bit over done. The cinematography was interesting but it had to be. It had a sock rocking ending though. All in all it was like a good Identity. Actually now that I say that its pretty damn similar to identity except without the subplot. Though a subplot could have made the movie more interesting.  Im thinking about taking up a sport to get fit and make my body better. Vi dunno what sport I have a few floating around in my head. Im not sure I want something that I can do by myself so I dont have to be a team player, I hate relying on other people I guess Im just not trusting.  I also had a brief look at some cars today and here the shock the mini had the most leg room out of all th cars I looked at including an astra and a Peugeot 206. the mini had the nicest interior with a kinky CD player. The back seats looked like theyd be shit for sex though the seatbelts stuck right up. But I suppose the car is sexy not used for sex, lol. Oh well it was THAT much better than all of the other cars, and it has like 6 airbaags so its good for safety.  1up shroom to: Tiffany who is ingrids friend whos pretty cool and smart  Poisoned Shroom to: australian for society, why does everything have to close so late?

       Levi I am now an official fan of Levi Strauss. When they discovered that their Bangladesh suppliers employed children under 14, Rather demanding that they be fired (they were the only support their families had) Levi paid for their education  and persuaded the suppliers to continue paying their wages while they went to school and give them a job whence they finished. now if that doesn't sound like a commendable company then i don't know what does.

       Common Room I think the single biggest reminder that year 12 is over the the lack of change essay. When your in grade 10 and eleven you hear people talk of the change essay, it sounds like it is the most important part of school life in year twelve. And now it is gone. no more change essay. I suppose the bored of studies thought it would be ironic to get rid of "change" right at the beginning of a massive change.  Isn't the irony Delicious ?

On the upside they got paid $750 million from Microsoft.   Aol has also been dropped from them moniker "Aol Time Warner" apparently it was having a negative impact on the consumer brand.  Yeah...

       It's Good I've come to the conclusion that it's good. What's good? the new JT (Justin Timberlake for all of you out there in TV land) song, of course! ITs 80s, its random, its funky, its catchy its everything a song should be. In fact it even has a catchy, marketable, slogan "'m Lovin' It" Of course due to new copy protection stuff -a-ma-jig  don't actually have the song, however right now I'm listening to  X Gonna Give It To Ya  by DMX for more info on them click  urlLink here . I'd give this song about 3 stars out of 5

       Shopping Spree Shopping spree Today!!!, I purchased:  A brown T-Shirt. IT has one of those funny v-necks. It looks like it will have a round collar, but then there's a bit cut out. i hope that made sense. And it has "Groupindividual" written across the top, which makes me look like i have broader shoulder. Which reminds me, it is impossible for me to find a suit that fits because my shoulders are too wide and my waist too thin... i thoughts how it was supposed to be. It was only $18  Another brown T-shirt without wacky collar. This ones a light kinda yellow-tan colour, I'm not that big of a fan of that. then it has brown writing and lines scrawled horizontally across it. It went against my "no horizontal line" rule, but mom liked it, so I got it. Another downside is that it  looks incredibly gay. It will be a low wear item.  To go with the shirts I got some jean shorts. they have these random velcro flaps, that do nothing at all except, of course, aesthetasize. they're 3/4 shorts. I have wanted a pair of 3/4 jean shorts for a while - John Hobbey wears them all the time, and he is cool so then the shorts must be cool. (except they remind me of a video-game for some reason)  I also got a blue grey shirt that has some fluorescent orange on it. it says M ONE 1, and a little square of it on the collar, i liked it the best of the shirts from Depot (all of the above). its slightly tighter, i could just like it because i fit in a small.  Then to General Pants Co for board shorts. i HHATE board shorts, they are the bane of my fashion existence. They VERY loosely follow fashion, and usually have very "busy" patterns.  Imagine my surprise when I found a very nice simple brown (my new favorite colour in clothes for some reason) pair of board shorts.   Then on lay by i have:  At esprit I got a pair of linen 3/4 shorts. they're really nice and light. they're plain white. Really simple. Cool pockets which are hard to explain. I really like them.   The at JAG (my favorite clothes store) i got another (third) brown T. this one has a faded print on the front saying "Floats Like A (picture of butterfly)" and on the back it says "Stings like A (picture of bee)"  And finally there was a pair of army print shorts in JAG, just sitting on the rack they looked but ugly but they looked good on the guy in the picture, so i tried them o and they didn't look too bad.  The catch? I'm not allowed to wear any of it untill schoolies, it's part of a graduation gift.   I'm supposed to be doing math right now, but i decided to write a really long boring post, my aim is 500 words, half my change essay.  I just can not do math at home, the only time i can study math is when I am at someone else's place like Luke or my tutor's.  I'm listening to  Never Give Up On The Good Times  from the album "Spiceworld" by The Spice Girls for more info on them click  urlLink here . I'd give this song about 4 stars out of 5

       Muzak Another trip to the library today, Hurrah, and we all know what the library means - thats right - NEW MUSIC!!!. today i got   Pnau *Jared Feints*  thats right, australian music. the cover pushed me over the edge. and most of the songs are as good as or better than follow me, so i'm content.  Garbage *Jared falls into coma* Its version 2 Pretty awesome, not as good as the tracks that i have from beautiful garbage yet, still good though  Britney Spears Oops... I did it again Old school pop, and mick liked the cover art.  John Mayer room for squares not bad, kinda boring though.  Hit Machine 18 absolute shit, boring no decent songs. waste of time etc  Placebo - without you i'm nothing not my type of music, the bitter end had more of a dance edge and that was what i was expecting

       Oreo Shakes 5 oreo cookies 5 scoops of ice cream milk  Take the five Oreos and lick the icing from inside of them. then place the exterior wafer things into a blender(its alright if you leave the icing in, i usually do), blend for a few seconds to ensure they are broken up. Next add the ice cream, then fill with milk up to the top of the ice cream, to fill in any gaps. Blend until parents yell at you for "All that noise". Pour into glass(es). Sreve fresh, and cold.   Caution: do not mix with stress, causes ill feeling in stummy  On yeah, just incase i didn't make it obvious i had an oreo milkshake tonight

       rule breaking Ok Ok, i know i have an unspoken rule whereby i don't talk about the hsc but i found one thing baffling. There was no visual text to analyze... oh well.   I liked my creative writing, it was about Little Red Riding Hood and Jack (from the beanstalk fame) it started off with each of their stories, and the lumber jack saves them both. but in the second half of the story its bout all of the repercussions of their actions. Little red Riding Hood had psychological problems from seeing a wolf murdered right in front of her, and jack after killing the giant, then had to get a mortgage, tried insurance fraud, and was caught. He was tried for murder, theft, insurance fraud and well thats all :)  I'm listening to  Sleep Together  from the album "Version 2.0" by Garbage for more info on them click  urlLink here .

       Alexander  Ok which is better? Oliver Stone with anthony hopkins with Angelina Jolie With  Colin Farrell With Val Kilmer  OR  Baz Luhrmann With Nicole Kidman With Leo  Preparation for his current film role has left Hollywood badboy  Colin Farrell with severe pain in his pants. The Irish star was getting into character for his role as historical legend Alexander  The Great, and injured his groin while honing his bareback horse-riding skills. Colin groans, "I had to ride bareback, which is something I haven't done before. It's a pain in the b*****ks, literally a                pain in the balls. "I have a really sore scrotum. They had nothing in those days so we have had to do the same. And that means no saddles or stirrups."   lol

       Music, again It's another one about  music  so you may not want to read this, but like y'know whatever :P  My current gripe is with people who say one type of music is better than another. Some people say Britney is crap because she makes pop music, and it's written for by someone else. Of course because she didn't make it herself it's not good, and because lots of people like it it is crap. Well, Christo merely designs an artwork (wrapping pont neuf it may be) and then he gets other people to do it, does that make his art any less valid? no. Shakespeare was popular at his time, does that mean that he was bad? no.   With all of the artistic areas (visual performing musical...) i think there is two layers, one layer wich is the artistic explorative, the stuff normal people don't get(why does the curtain only go up half way, why are they just a random sploge of paint etc  And then thereis the area for the common person, stuff that is there to look and sound good.Britney, Anything from Hollywood, posters and advertisements,   in conclusion i think there are two levels to art the high art, which is meant for artistes and the common level things which arent normally called are, but are pretty similar, poster adds etc..

       The art debate rages. [my bold] "For  some  " I think Linez is right. For some people it is sacred,  something  for some other people (like me) its something that, I feel, should be part of our society -something anyone can (and should) have an opinion on. art is just a creation, just like any other object the only difference is why they were created.   The new super-slim iPod once again redefines what a digital music player should be. It�s lighter than 2 CDs, can hold up to 10,000 songs, and downloads music at blazing speeds. Now you can take your entire music collection with you wherever you go. Available for Mac and Windows.  Over a million sold Now in its third generation, the iPod is, hands-down, everyone�s favourite digital music player. And with its unrivaled performance and stunning design, it�s the must-have player for music-loving Mac and Windows users, who keep buying the iPod in record numbers. This in turn has pushed iPod sales to well over a million units.

       Art Ok, so we're not supposed to express our opinion art, or our ideas about art. we are supposed to walk through a gallery in complete silence. We are not supposed to talk things over before we do them. right it sounds like someone wants art to be elitist.  art should be discussed and thought about so you get as many different angles, points of view, ideas and information so you can make a better work / opinion yourself.  I didn't want to talk about my art major work because i was basing it on my experiences, though that later changed. however some artworks should be planned, discussed, modified to get their idea across better or to refine their idea. Yeah i know i have repeated myself but its this goddamn touch typing i swear.

      Most  supercomputers  cost upwards of 100 million dollars, some people at"virginia tech university have recently made the second most powerful supercomputer in the world. Everyone knows macs are expensive and that is what they used the new mac g5. Guess how much it cost them? 5 million dollars thats right a 20th of the cost of most supercomputers. The price of the fastest supercomputer? $350 million ie  70 times  the price payed by virginia tech, interesting huh?

       iTMS iPod and OutKast I'm listening to  Hey Ya  by OutKast for more info on them click  urlLink here . I'd give this song about 4 stars out of 5 it rocks!  it has the  trippiest  video-clip using superimposing, blue-screens and what not! And there is so much green, so very very green. The only problem is that there aren't any specific lines i can quote of sing, - though i suppose thats  good thing for the people who hang around wit me.    Don't read this:  First some background on the two competing media types. All the new PC  music download  programs use  WMA  (windows media audio). This is a propriety Microsoft format, which means that every song sold makes money for Microsoft. Apple uses  AAC  (advanced audio codec) in their iTunes Music Store. This was developed by Dolby and is an open format (no one makes money from the sales).   The iPod, which has over 50% of the mp3 player market, doesn't support  WMA. Apple is launching the iTunes Music Store (iTMS) for windows. If Apple makes a huge enough marketing push they should be able to get an even more massive chunk of the mp3 player market, and while doing this if they choose not to support WMA then anyone who owns / buys an iPod will be forced to use the iTMS thereby  ensuring the success of the iTMS . However this would perpetuate the idea that apple computers don't work well with non apple products.  The other option is to make the iPod play WMA which would give the iPod an even larger  market share in the mp3 player market.  This would probably be the better option because apple makes more money from the iPod than they would from the iTMS and it would make apple appear more user friendly.    ok you can start reading again   1 up shroom to: Apple - having the (voted) #1 coolest product - the iPod  Poisoned Shroom to: King Lear

       Hey - a title Last night was Caroline's 18th. Well, I suppose the entire day was Caroline's eighteenth, but i'll focus on the evening. In the evening we all piled in our cars in two and fours and made our ways to the Chinese Restaurant on Terminous street. The night started off fairly decently - Caroline was opening her presents, a book of erotic stories, some disney princess books - come to think of it though they're one in the same- and some condoms, a very interesting series of gifts. She had the most beautiful ring too  The real fun started when Jared, Horwood, Luke and Evan got up and sung. The did house of the rising sun. The main gripe i have is (remember that karaoke is there for bad singing) was that either they held the mikes too far from their mouthes or they were too quiet - SPEAK UP DAMNIT. Caroline and Jenny sang, i think the most rousing part of the song was "Gek Australia" moving and yet touching.  I had a talk with Aaron and he's going to try to be nicer - which is good. No more avoiding him :P Though one thing i didn't get to say to him was that even though there has been a retro revival tight pants and button shirts without undershirts didn't come back. on the upside though he wore red which is more of his colour :P  Now because luke went offline before I had a chance to say this to him I shall say it here.  Luke I know you have  high hopes, and I know that right now your feeling a bit disheartened but giving up won't help you. It's tough  but you have to have the determination and one of the things i have always admired in you is that you CAN do it, you do work, you do study, if you do try; don't stop that now, you beat me in the trials at  math, and I (lets face it) rock at math, so that says something. Don't forget the math trials are ALOT harder than the HSC. Also the math course is a hard one, there were entire school where not a single student 'passed'.  And don't forget you have all sorts of resources to help you you can try the HSC help line teachers I'm sure Evan's willing to lend a hand. In summary : You rock, and therefor you can do it so don't stop trying  1 up shroom: Luke  Poisoned shroom: My king lear essay which, again hasn't gotten done  I'm listening to  It's Gonna Be Me  by N'Sync for more info on them click  urlLink here  I'd say its about 3 out of 5

      There are some basic thing that can give something you say the apppearance of not being a rant 1)Spelling 2)Grammer These two things are eaily remedied by initially writing it in word, then copying it intop the forum / comments section They also give the apearance of not 'losing your cool' 3)Introduce some structure, i dont mean intro body conclusion, but reply to points the person before made, then make new point, or there might be something better but dont just ramble on 4)avoid emotive language, and ecessive adjectives this makes it appear less facutal and more bias 5)Length - make sit look like you put more thought into your response 6) Agree with them about soem minor point, thatway it looks like your looking at the problem from both sides.  Here is a bad one:  You realy need to grow up everyone nows that pcs are are bettr than macs because they are suported by more software. this is really important good software makes the computer good macs dont have and good games too wich is boring and no fun macs suck.  (in my opinion) a better one:  Macs have lots available software, also the ammount of software is not as important as the quality of the software. For example the Windows Movie Maker software is available, but that does not mean it is good or frequently used, whereas iMovie 3 on Mac is simple to use and, therefor, is more commonly used. I do agree with your point that there aren't enough games, however most of the major games do come to Mac. What I do believe makes up for this is how simple it is to use Macs, and the software that is included with Macs.   Ah yes, any chance to sell either Mac or Nintendo...

      Based on my experiance with the band (wich is limited mainly to version 2.0) I'm going to have to disagree with jared about his garbage theory, i for one belive that beautiful garbage is their best cd (i've heard 5 of the songs). To me it sounds like garbage were exparimenting with more sounds,  most of the songs on version 2.0 are pretty samey... ohwell i'm downloading 5 more garbage songs so my opinion might change.

      two interesting things on tv tongiht  the first:  queer eye for the straight guy, it was prpetty funnyespecially when they were waxing that guy's back *shudder* and when they were watching him aon the actual date.   the next thing  was the recruit it was pretty predicable (if you already knew the ending) but hey it had colin Farrell in it, and he is always a pleasure - not like that.

      Don't you love americans, this is taken directly from the compaq help page:  Compaq FAQ: Where do I find the "Any" key on my keyboard? (FAQ2859)       The term "any key" does not refer to a particular key on the keyboard. It simply means to strike any one of the keys on your keyboard or handheld screen.

That's impossible. That would ntotally never happen. ITS A MOVIE, DAMNIT. if anythinng hapens that can't wont shouldn't or couldn't then it was the magic movie magic, yes magic movie magic, not regular movie magic. I'm not entirely sure if it's the job of the director or the audiance for this little thing called 'suspension of disbeliefe' but i htink the audiance has a little something to do with it, or at least laugh at the lookey monkeys quietly...  Saw tomb raider tongiht, and LXG last night. if i saw tomb raider alone (like not afer LXG) i would have liked it, its the type of aqdventure movie i love, you know the type of movie that LXG is. except LXG has some awesome special effects, and skinner has an incredibly sexy accent, i'm moving to liverpool... NOW *waves*  Apparently Gerard Butler is to play the lead in the movie adaptation of the phantom of the opera, as directed by Joel shumacher. Damn why joel schumacher? sure phone book was good, and  A Time To Kill wasn't bad either, but let me just say Batman forever and then batman and robin... yes.... i'm sorry too, no i can't do anything. anyways this is the new lead for the fantom of the opera:  Damn i can't find a better shot of him :    1 Up Shroom to: Skinner's Accent  Poisoned Shroom to: lack of suspended disbelief...

      Alright, i have edited my blog, but all i have done is get rid of all alusions to my flash crush, soem social evetns and minimised referances to other people. menh if your THAT curious then you can email me at pacmacmikey@yahoo.com  I totally dig Holly's new song, state of mind its got an electronicy dancy edge to it. the videoclip is totally 80s too. i did some research on 80s clothes and what are acid wash jeans exactly? arent they just like the worn look of today? menh.   Marioparty later at deons place, wit luke should be very cool, sorry for no long interesting sentences or chains of thought but my mind was used up when i was trying to figure out math. can anyone explain to me how to diferentiate tan^3(x/3) ? or was it 3/x either way i dont get it. if it was just tan(x/3) it'd be easy. i probably should have paid attention in math.   lots of good notes tonight, and here's another i might be going to krispy kreme tomorrow, mmm krispyliscious...this time though i shall get two boxes of plain - they're the best.   1 up shroom Censoring for audiance - i feel like FOX 'News' and i use the term news loosley  Poisoned shroom: *insert name of clash crush who isnt quite gone yet* damn flash crush remnants

       I'm Full Of Posts Today I'm full of posts today,   Because of all the "controversy" surrounding the suspicion that Briotney slept with Colin Farrell he sent a shirt to Britney saying  "I slept with Colin Farrell and all I got was this lousy T-Shirt"   and a bumper stick reading  "Honk if you've slept with Colin Farrell"  Apparently she wasn't too happy, and when when on the fone he was laughing so hard that she started yelling and hung up on him

      I was just thinking.... how significant are first impressions if you have already met / gotten to know the person online? I already figured out first impressions online (when I "met" the same person twice, once on AOL and once on Yahoo - he thought i knew it was him, I thought he was completely different people, it was then that i learnt the impact of first impressions)   But what if you already know someone online and then meet them in real life? Does your opinion of them change? I could understand if people didnt really think of online people as people, and  therefor meeting this net person was like a "new" person who you just knew alot about the background. I could also understand if it was like meeting a friend you hadn't seen in 10 years and you kind of have to re-evaluate your relationship to see if it is still where it should be. And then it might just be like meeting someone you already knew. And then there's the question of how much all of this changed when you add in audio chat, and then when you add in video conferancing...

      I can't believe how excited about buying a small, material possesion. I can only think of like three reasons. Artificial need created by Apple, need to impress with gadgets and there is probably one more, but I can't think of it right now.    Artificial need creation   This is one of the main complaints against advertising, that it makes people think they need things they don't. It's responsible for the sterile cleanliness of houses of today. 50 years ago there was no domestos, but somehow people managed to survive those nasty bacteria. However in this case they might be making me think that I need this because it will make me cool.   Need To Impress / Image   Everyone knows I'm a mac nerd, so I have to have the stuff that makes me a mac nerd right? I need it to help highlight my image etcetera. It's hard to explain, let's just say why do people pay so much for that little thing that says "Gucci"  If I think of the reasons I am using to justify my purchase they are: Can use it at the gym Don't have to borrow john's discman Listen to music at any time Games, for when im bored Superiour product design Works best with iTunes  (ie can't buy a cheaper one)  Are those decent reasons to spend an obscene abount of money?  Other things I could buy: 2 More Gamecube controllers (Wireless),  Mariokart Double Dash!!, Soul Caliber 2 and Fzero x Good speakers for my computer, and have $ left over  I've survived without music 27 / 7 before. Why can't I now?

      Logic board is the original term, and motherboard comes from from a  reverse naming scheme. They called cards that plugged into the  logic board "Daughter cards" and thus the logic board became  "motherboard".  I was wondering what it meant when I had a crack in my logic board, and when they werent sure if it was the ide cord going from my screen to my logic bored. Well now I know.

      Isn't it funny when people say things that completely devalues what they were saying seconds ago? Especially when they think they are making a powerful statement (which is really just a cliche either being used perfectly, and subtly or completely incorrectly, for the sake of my amusement I have choosen the latter).  Side note 1; The reason some of my posts are decidedly vague like this one is because they relate to someone I believe may occasionaly read McThis.  Side note 2; I shall be posting on abbreviated schedual for the next week for reasons I prefer to not disclose, as they may harm the percieved integrity of the parties involved.

      I saw  urlLink  Le Divorce   last night. It was a pretty good movie. It was kinda boring but overall pleasant. It is about a girl who goes to  urlLink France  to see her sister, who is about to get married. But just as she arrives the fiance is leaving. The rest of the movie is about the different problems that arise from this, and how the Americans and the French deal with things differently.   urlLink Kate Hudson   has a sort of appearance where you cant take you're eyes off her, She lights up the room which lends the movie a happy feeling. The costumes were fantastic,Ingris and I kept leaning over and commenting on the different clothes they were wearing. some of the jokes were misses but most of them were pretty funny.   The only things that sucked were her hair cut for the second half,  urlLink James Ivory  needed to build up the relationships a bit more (I didn't realise that two of the characters were dating until she said "I can't get a new husband until i get rid of my old one") and the plot did meander a bit. The times that were boring should have been used to develop and fill in some of the smaller plot strands. The crazy american lover could definitely been used for a few more laughs.  All in all a  pleasant comedy  set in france. Any change to laugh at the  urlLink french  is good. Kate Hudson just made it better. I would give it 7 / 10.  Sorry for the lack of a LOTD yesterday, i didn't get home until 12:07 so I missed out. Here's two to make up for it    urlLink  NaNoWriMo   Its a challenge - write an entire 50,000 word novel between Nov. 1 and Nov. 30 People who are getting  sponsors for their  urlLink children  .  There's my attempt at utisiling the web medium, but writing only brief ammounts, utilising  urlLink linking ,  boldening  the important words and allowing interaction.

       New New New blog Ok first of all I didn't know the other template was pink, as far as i could see it was grey and white. I swear. Second of all it used tables, tables, tables. Everywhere i looked there were tables. Tables are bad, CSS is good. CSS is good because it makes everything more consistent and easier to read and modify.  The links are on the left. This should make life easier because the mouse will most likely already be at the side because that is where the scroll bar is.   There are a few things to change. Heres a list of them 1) The bold is going from the links on the right (to put more emphasis on the headings  [ links archives description] for easier navigation) 2)I'm going to fix the archives 3) There's more but i can't be assed to figure it out now.  Please, comment!

       Matrix recycles "When Moss and Reeves lock lips, it looks like  two wire coat hangers trying to get it on. "    i wonder if i can find many more like this...  The Wachowskis must have  emptied every S&#38;M and leather store in Australia  (the films' shooting location) in order to dress the extras in this scene.  After living in New York and L.A., I thought I had seen everything.  I was wrong.     ok thats interesting  Nonetheless he&#8217;s able to reach an agreement with the machine leader--a roiling, disembodied face that&#8217;s amusingly  reminiscent of Zordon from the old &#8220;Power Rangers&#8221;  series--   It&#8217;s taken &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; only three episodes to reach the level of turgid mediocrity that George Lucas didn&#8217;t succumb to until his second &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; trilogy.  About the only thing one can be  thankful for in &#8220;The Matrix Revolutions&#8221; is that Jar Jar Binks isn't in it.    dumberer "S/M club" sequence, which could only inspire more laughter if it included Leslie Nielsen in nipple clamps. Obviously, this silly stuff's a  matter of taste, or lack thereof.    With their third (and hopefully, final) Matrix movie, the Wachowski brothers have delivered a dud so disappointing, they may as well have  bussed in Ewoks to save Zion .   The dialogue is so bad that the audience was  laughing its collective ass  off in my screening.   I'm undecided if im going to see it or not.

       Sunday Today doesn't feel like a wednesday. On wednesday the week is supposed to be catching up with you, but you're getting used to it, you may even begin to be looking forward to the weekend. That was not today. Today was DEFINITELY a sunday. You've done all the interesting stuff on the Friday and the Saturday so on sunday you kinda wander around the house knowing you should be doing work of some kind, but purring it off because its still the weekend.   LOTD :  Ever wondered who owns Channel ten? then felt disappointed that a large portion was owned by a canadian company? No? i have. If you ever do you can find out  urlLink here . Did you know that VH1 and MTV are both owned by Viacomm?   I saw the best product placement on  Merrick and Russo unplanned  tonight. Well it wasn't product placement per say - it wasn't  planned  (get it). What happened was that one of them had duct tape on their chest (I missed that part) and he tore it off. One of the members of the audience asked to have it so she could sell it on Ebay. Everyone knows that to get the product said costs double than what it to get it seen. Then she repeated it - twice. Even to the extent of claiming she was the "Queen of  urlLink Ebay ".   Thank you and goodnight. Hopefully tonight will be better than last night when i couldn't get to sleep until 2 a, because...well never you mind why

       Cube Rulez "the sales rate of GameCube has quadrupled in the 35 days since the company dropped the price of the system to the mass-market [US]$99 point. The console has grabbed 18 points of market share from PlayStation 2 and Xbox, Nintendo said, more than doubling its previous 19 percent piece of the pie to 37 percent -- a much larger slice. GameCube now runs a "strong second" to PlayStation 2 in monthly sales, at least based on October sell-through data. "  Being that the GameCube is now only $199 down here, i think it would be a great opportunity for people to pick it up, with games like Mario Party, Beach Spikers, Mario Kart Double Dash (nov. 14) and more who wouldn't want it?

      In a quite preposterous and perplexing move, I may be relocating to  urlLink Orange  for University. The preposterous part? It's still called Sydney University even though it is definately no where near Sydney. The perplexing part? How I will survive in a rural community (Yes I know it is already a  urlLink TV Show ) Right now im looking at either doing bachelor of the arts or of liberal studies at orange. In either case i am reminded of what will said on  urlLink Will and Grace  "Next year, I want a real cowboy"  I suppose if I want to fulfil my part in both shows though, I will have to release a porn tape.

      Some people think paying AUD$ 11 for a movie is way too much money, however every now and again a great deal comes along. In the case of  Love Actually  (  urlLink Rotten Tomatos,   urlLink IMDB  ) you get nine fantastic movies for the price of one. They are all based on semi-stereotypical characters and almost cliched storylines, but this serves as a way of allowing the director to explore the romantic comedy genre. Comparing this to  urlLink Scream  would be taking it a notch too far, but it does poke fun of itself in the same way. Lines about movies, a fairy tale ending and closing scenes coupled with the tagline "The ultimate romantic comedy" clearly highlights the intentions of this film.  One of the things that makes this venture into fairy land so special, and credible, is the fantastic acting on the behalf of the stunning cast.  urlLink Hugh Grant  plays the mischievious and lovable Prime Minister with impeccible comic timing.  urlLink Colin Firth  make's an almost farcical (and ironically least comic) story line seem realistic and believable.  urlLink Emma Thompson  managed to give reason to the script, without over powering it. The last role I saw her in was as Beatrice in  urlLink Much Ado About Nothing  and although the two characters are externally very differant, they are intrinsically similar. The only time the acting faltered was with the children, but this is to be expected.  The direction was excelent for  urlLink  Richard Curtis'  first outing. In saying this there were flaws, such as the irregular pace and perhapse too fairy tale story which left you longing for more scandal, or at least someone getting dumped.   In all a hilarious charming formulaic romantic comedy that doesnt take its self too seriously.   92/100   I'm sure Caroline will most likely describe this movie some what along the lines of "A venture into Mike's mind"

Colin Farrell has played bulsey (in tight leather, like the bikey) has been a police officer 3 times,  has been a cowboy, like the indian, and has been in the army thrice... hmmmm

      there are words that sound plural that arent and words that can be plural but shouldnt today i shall give a vague example / discussion  Sheep sounds plural. eit SHOULDNT be a singular aswell its why i keep trying to get people to say shOOp for one and shEEp for two, its much more logical really it is.  but the real reason i wrote this was the word 'gays' HONESTLY gay is an adjective not a french connection united kingdom ing noun it should be gay people. you dont say he is a gay yoou say he is gay. like you dont say he's a running (unless it a vierd accent) you say he is running. if there are alot of people running you dont say look at all of the runnings you say look at all the running people.   ps i like stuff

I then realised that I didnt want to use the word diet ie i was one of those people. FYI I'm eating healthy....

As for confusion i came online to find sam online, and i typers out a long boring message about my day, involving cuts 'n' what not. i looked at my contact list because it looked like sam was away ... then i looked up the list and sam was online... i know two sams...

      I just read:   urlLink  What You Can't Say  its pretty interesting, and odd.   On another note I just found something that highlights how much I have changed over the past 2 years. In grade ten I gave out questionnaires to see how people percieved me. They ranged from simple impersonal questions to moderately personal. However its not the answers to the questions which show how i've changed but the actual questionnaire (and the incoherant english used in my wording of some of the questions). Back then i was completely agaisnt censoring my thoughts and.. I left before finishing the post and now have been overtaken by a feeling of tired so this sentence is not complete.

      The night started off by being rejected not once, not twice but thrice! four times if you count my stomach rejecting the idea of not causing me grief. First Aaron was like, nah im not up for it tonight, Then evan was like like nah im totally not allowed, then luke was like I'd love to, that is untill i got to his place then he was all dude im not allowed either. So i put on my favourite song, show me your soul, and started the long drive to carolines. It would have been simple excpet i missed a road three times, and then another one three times! all in all i did about 8 3 point turns. I was so much fun. infact it was Pain inducing fun! Caroline was all like i need a nurofen all this smiling's starting to hurt.

      Every now and again I forget why I don't talk to deon, but whenever I do I am almost always immediately reminded. I was just talking to him and I say that my Mini is steptronic. He immediately tells me it isnt, y'know because he is an expert at Mini's. I copy and paste from their webpage and he tell's me they're wrong. And then he laughs at me because Mini is made by BMW. By this point I'm fairly irritated so I make my usual call that BMWs are better than Audis (Which Australia's two main auto magazines, Wheels and Motos, seem to agree with), With the exception of the A8 which is supposed to be better (I'm not sur eby how much) than the BMW 7 series. Deon tells me that Audi owns Lamburghini (Or however it's spelt) so that automatically means they're better. Well for one thing just because one company owns another doesnt mean thatget ALL of their technology, Audi still does most of their own stuff, or shares it with VW (VW is the parent company of Audi, Bently and Lambo). But according to VW Lamburghini is run as close to being a seperate company as possible to keep the same feel etc within their cars. and unless that has changed fairly recently im pretty sure im right.   But i mean that's not all that bother's me: The fact that I get a new car and he implies its crap He goes offline repeatedly so I can't rebutt he throws a whole bunch of semi related links which arent written by professionals and then thinks these few loosly related amateur sites are the truth  Tehres mroe but im far too irritated

      Just because i am such a competative twat I am going to out link  urlLink Caroline .   I just finished watching urlLink The Simpsons  it was pretty good, they even had  urlLink Ian McKellan  and the chick that wrote  urlLink Harry Potter   My dad got his  urlLink BMW  today it was a  urlLink 318I  pretty nice except its in the ugliest white colour. I looked at a  urlLink Mini  today. It was blue with a black roof. It also had a sun roof and funky wheels. I'm getting it off (not in THAT sence) the hottest guy, well at least an 8 and I know he's  urlLink gay  because he was wearing a  urlLink Fendi  watch. His name was... wait for it... Colin!!! Y'know like the totally dreamy  urlLink Colin Farrell  *swoons*  I'm mildly irritated with  urlLink Yahoo!   urlLink mail  I can't use it from a  urlLink POP3  email  urlLink client    I had an idea for  urlLink emoticons . I thought that the eyes should be based on which you use; colon or semi colon etc. that way you could have a wink and a smile or a wink and a frown etc. IT wouldnt be that hard to do, contextual smiley faces, I like.   I'm going to take a break to watch  urlLink The Resort  on  urlLink Channel Ten . Back, I got bored half way through and left, it definately wasnt ass good as the first episode. But I think that's because the first episode focused more on the people. Thats why I heart  urlLink Big Brother    Speaking of  urlLink OutKast  (on  urlLink Caroline 's blog) I really like the new song  urlLink The Way You Move  it has an odd video clip. Buy yeah I agree with caroline  urlLink Hey Ya!  is awesome too. Oh and just because i think people need them here are some good music pages  urlLink Launch  Video clips and general info  urlLink iTunes Link Maker   urlLink IGN Music  I usually disagree with their reviews so I dont know why I'm recomending them  urlLink Rolling Stone  The quintessential music mag  Oh and relating to  urlLink Caroline 's entry again, this time about the  urlLink iPod .  urlLink Caroline 's getting one, I've got one Dodds' got one,  urlLink Jenny 's getting one, Mick's getting one and Evan might be getting one. Now I see why everyone's talking about how great they are, and I see why  urlLink Apple 's releasing the iPod mini! I totally heart my iPod, I have all my phone number on there just incase my phone isnt with me. The second best thing about the iPod (First being the scroll wheel) is definately  urlLink iTunes .   32, Can't Touch This! (I feel so MC Hammer)

       1.   urlLink Norah Jones ' new  urlLink videoclip for sunrise  is awesome, and by awesome I mean that the part where she dances is hilarious!   2.  I started a meme ( urlLink definition )(I think)   Correction  I was wrong  urlLink Caroline  informs me that she picked it up from  urlLink Carson , I think I remember reading it once from  urlLink Kottke  or a link from there, but in a different context. I did not know that  urlLink Carson  said it, but him saying it means it is 30% more stylish, I apologise here is the rest of this point as it was before.  I said "Heart" a few times to  urlLink Caroline  and then she started to say it. Her saying it started  urlLink Jenny  saying it. I wonder how far it will go.   3.   urlLink I   Hate You    So Much    Right Now    4.  I heart  urlLink  Carnival Town  by  urlLink Norah Jones    5.  I discovered how to link to songs in  urlLink iTunes  (see carnival town links). Want to do it too? Go to www.apple.com/itunes/linkmaker/ I had it linked before but for somereason it changed the address and directed it to a 404 error. It added "http://blogger.com/lofi/" to the beginning of it so if anyone (IE you  urlLink Caroline  or  Luke ) knows how to fix this give me a hollar in the comments section.   6.  I am getting bloody good at this  urlLink linking  thing   7.  I got 16 links in this entry, do I rock or do I  urlLink rock ? Make that 17!  That Is All

      I will never shop in Grace Bros. again. Not by choice or anything but because it doesnt exist any more. I vam shocked that i am so pissed off at this. I was always a David Jones man, but I still liked going to Grace Brothers. They had nice christmas decorations and funky clothes. But now where there was Grace Brothers there is Myer. For one thing theiur logo looks like they are trying too hard to be David Jones. Well not really. But I liked the old Grace Bros. logo. It was red, a very bold choice for a high end company, but the flower symbolised the australianess of the company and simply haveing "bros" in their name showed how they were family oriented. David jones what the up market for snooty people store and grace brothers was for the upmarket normal people, or atleast thats how it looked to me. Myer.. what the fuck is a myer?! It's for letters and doesnt end with a "S" it doesnt even sound normal. And that font, it's pugly. It's like they're just flushing all the branding efforts down the toilet. I didnt even see any "Grace bros is now myer, same company different name" or "Same store, same quality your used to but now a different name. Myer" No. Now it seems like a hostile takeover where the grace family was muscled out of their business.  Brands are recorded in peoples brains in a similar way that friends are. It feels like Myers just murdered one of my acquantances.

      I bought Tasty      I hadn't even thought about buying Tasty before I left the house. I had  planned to get the new Norah Jones CD, however as I was comparing the merit's of Norah Jones soothing voice, Shannon Noll's country themed songs  and The Black Eyed Peas' soon-to-be-3 #1s a lovely lady caught my eye, a lovely lady named Kelis. I pretty much knew I was going to buy that CD, but of course I made myself pretend to evaluate it (listening to it, debating if it was worth taking a chance if it would work with iTunes[wack copy protection]). Of course as soon as I walked out of the store I realised I had been a victim of great  graphic design .  The cover looks a lot better in real life. How awesome is that cover picture. The makeup  brings your eyes stright to her's and then to her lips , which are flourescent pink, which strongly contrast her flourescent white teeth. Everything seems to have a reddish tint to it. This, coupled with the fact that you don't see any clothes on her (suggesting nakedness) creates a  sexy atmosphere . Her eyes, however, are lined a silvery colour with big dark eyelashes which is more innocent than sexy. Her hair fills up the rest of the cover to create interesting texture and push the focus to her face.  "Kelis" is written in a very unique curvey  font  which seems playful, cutting edge and cool at the same time. By placing this ontop of everything it gets pushed to the front. While "Kelis" is made to stand out "Tasty" is practically hidden, its pushed to the back by the use of a simple pinkish red colour for the font, as well as a similar shinyness to it as the rest of the objects on the cover. This with the fact that it seems to be a part of her rather than floating on top of her pushes it so far into the background that it is virtually the last thing you see.    By having her name and her face being the focus, not the album itself it is clear that this release is designed  promote Kelis  to the status of celebrity. This is also shown in her image make over. The last time I remember seeing her she had a multicoloured afro, and now she has a more natural looking hairstyle. She is also going for the sultry sexy look, compared to the playfully loud "I hate you so much right now" look.   On the back of the cover is a  mini poster , just like the one from the Junior Senior CD. It depicts her laying on her side. on a large red reflective suface. Her legs look like they're a kilometer long below an ass that evern Sir-Mix-Alot could (and I'm sure does) love.   Moments later I saw   urlLink Something's Gotta Give  . It wan't bad it was pretty funny, had a bit of a boring middle and definately needed younger actors! *shudders at thought of  urlLink Diane Keaton  almost naked* but overall about a  7/10

      I know EXACTLY what my mini is going to be called. I was talking to  urlLink Caroline  and I said "they may as well have called  urlLink The Italian Job  The  urlLink Mini  Product Placement" So I was thinking about it and since I think  urlLink Jason Statham  is kinda how (body & accent are 10 / 10) I've decided to name my mini Handsome Rob! So who want's to be the first to ride Handsome Rob with me?

      I spent the entire lecture staring at him, or whenever the lecturer was talking writing about him. But that was purely because I was basing a slash character on him. He has the most fantastic eyes, I don't even think there is a word for the colour that they are. It's kinda like the colour of the ocean except really light. And he has the nicest hair, it's really dark brown - almost black. He keeps it hidden under a trucker ha, which is a similar colour to his eyes. He has a really simple goatee too just a parch under his chin. All of his clothes match his hat and his eyes. Well, at least i know he's gay *giggles*  This guy is so hot he defines the word Hotacular. If you type into google "Define: Hotacular" it will have a picture of him. If you type in just "hotacular" into google and then hit I'm Feeling Lucky it will take you to a picture of him.   Only problem is I think he thinks I'm a wierdo. I forgot to shave I forgot deoderant I didn't have paper / pen so I got the tutor to write her email on my arm I probably had a red mark on my face from leaning on my arm I'm Canadian

      I had luke evan and Caroline voer tonight. Luke and evan were making music, but we stopped them because it was antisocial. That is untill me and caroline got in on the fun, then it was OK. But first to piss off caroline because it is just wasted space, and to piss off luke because well.. it's a semi naked male here is a   hot cowboy      Here's the song  urlLink  Better Than Jess   The title was caroline's idea after she saw the last song i had made was "jesstastic" which can be found below as song #2 i believe

      Truth be told i'm not all that happy with Panther. They said expose would change the way i use my computer (they not being apple but all the other computer nerds) It didn't. They said it would be noticable faster ont he same computer. I got a new computer with a much better processor and it seems vitrually identicle to my old one. Definately not "noticable faster". It doesnt seem to beach ball any less. I dunno.. i guess i was just expecting too much...

      I had another odd dream.  In this one Wilson was filthy rich, and for some reason had Colin Farrell staying with him.  All that i remember other than that was that i was trying to convince him to get an Aston Martin and that i had a conversation with Colin Farrell even though wilson didn't want me to know that Colin was there. Apparently he didn't want Colin to feel uncomfortable or something... Wierd!

      Luke talks about how how spain shouldn't call 200 dead "the spanish 9/11" because it devalues the real "9/11". Of course the "real 9/11" devalues the  18,000 people who die a day from hunger or a related cause.   The bush admin spend 40 billion on its army for two things 1) the war on terror and 2) saddam hussein. So lets say  half of that went to fighting terrorism because of the twin towers. That's about 20 Billion Dollars. That could sponsor 714 285 children for a month.  /rant  I have the best lecture on mondays. It's for my introduction to texts which could be an incredibly boring subject, but so far he hath shown us the tongue commercial, read to us a story about billy and the barglebogle, and a range of other very spiffy stuff. The only problem is that i always start thingking and coming up with ideas. Damn manipulative lecturer.

      I used to always read these things about RSS feeds and how their webpages were now better for them, or how they hated how some other webpages dealed with it. I would always think "Pfft, what has RSS ever done for me" then i saw a little link on  urlLink Lancearthur.com  saying "add to  urlLink My Yahoo! ". So lo and behold My Yahoo! now supports RSS feeds. I now understand why RSS is such a beautiful thing.  It means that i can check if most of my commonly read blogs have updated at once instead of going from blog to blog to blog. and now i am going to figure out how to make an RSS feed of my McBlog.

      I had a dream the other night, first time in a while. I dont remember much except there was this part where i was going down a road and it got all twisty and stuff (not just left and right twisty but it kinda went up on its side and stuff) it just kept getting twistier untill it was practivally verticle on it side.  as this was happenigng the doad was heading deeper into a half stereotypical forrest / half canadian type forrest. and there were kinda spirits around. Apparently (no joke this is what happened) whenever you buy an apple product someone's spirit gets trapped there. lol  I had another dream which as far as i can tell had two possible endings. It starts off with this giant game of hide and seek in version 1 i run and hide in this abandoned building, of coruse the abadnoned beulding turns oout to be a hotel, which ahs a very odd elecator and hall structre. it seemed to be based on triangles. The other ending is where i go to hide in this confectionary store and end up working there and integrating all their computer so that they have a much faster business or soemthing like that, but then i had to go because the camp counselors were angry at me for hiding out of bounds (how the hell was i supposed to kow)

      I hat eit when people get me thinking, So much effort that could be spent on better things (Plotting how to get Colin Farrell to move in with me ;) ) But after my first text lectures and the discussion about "Wardrobe Malfunction" I was thinking about an article that was linked to a while ago. The two of them together basically went along the lines that some thing's dont exist untill you give them a name. The next day I had a lecture on adversiting, and i was wondering why there hadn't been as many "evil corperations" or so much advertising untill recently. And then it hiot me this is when western civilisation has been labeled capitalist. As soon as we knew what we were we worked on being the best at that as we could. Same with advertising.   Anyways im probably wrong, after all i do go to UWS, not USYD, so nyeh

      I'd be lying if I was to say that I had something specific in mind when i started wrtinging this. In fact I would be lieing if I said I had something in mind right now. The only reason I'm writing right now is becaue I don't want to get back to work on my assignment yet.  I suppose the only real thing to say right now is that I'm chatting to a relatively cute guy on MSN. He's kinda bufftacular. He's got one of those pictures where if i met him in real life he couold be hot or he could be not... Who knows.

      LUSAKA (Reuters) - A 50-year-old Zambian man has hanged himself after his wife found him having sex with a hen, police said Friday.  The woman caught him in the act when she rushed into their house to investigate a noise.  "He attempted to kill her but she managed to escape," a police spokesman said.  The man from the town of Chongwe, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Lusaka, killed himself after being admonished by other villagers.  The hen was slaughtered after the incident.

      I just read  urlLink Famtracker  (probably a bad idea after my last post). They have their commentary on People's (America's version of Who) 50 Most Beautiful people. Here are the highlights.  Bloom's nose is featured in a section titled "Most Wanted," which details the "most wanted" lips, eyes, nose, cheekbones of the stars. The possessor of each perfect feature is described with a snappy, verb-centric sentence; for example, of Nicole Kidman's skin: "She glows." Or Johnny Depp's cheekbones: "He smolders." Of Bloom's coveted nose: "He commands."   That's right. Orlando Bloom's nose commands. It commands you! To do what, it's not entirely clear. Assumedly, to get thee to a rhinoplasty clinic.   ---  All the familiar characters are here: the token actress of a certain age (Diane Keaton); the token sports guy (Yankee Alex Rodriguez, barely nosing out his pin-up boy teammate, Derek Jeter); the token woman still desperately trying to shed the masculine residue of an Oscar-winning role (Hilary Swank); the token divinely anointed hunk of beefcake (Jim Caviezel); the token Jennifer Aniston (Jennifer Aniston).  ---  But where do we fit in? How do I compare on the percentile-scale of true beauty? It's easy to find out! Here's the formula: "To do a self-analysis, draw an imaginary line from the pupil of your eye down toward your jaw. Draw a second line from the nostrils across your cheeks. The bottom of your cheekbone should fall at or below the intersection of these lines. If it is higher, your face may appear flat and masculine."  If your cheekbone falls at or below the intersection of these lines, please take your flat and masculine face and report to your local repurposing plant, where you will be reprocessed as protein-rich feed for the beautiful.  She glows. She sparkles. He smolders. You suck.

      I had a dream about Colin Farrell last night. I really love drema like that, where you get to meet someone that you've had a crush on and they meet and exceed all of your expectations, because everything is perfect in your dreams. The dream basically consiisted of me coming home (to a really awesome home) and seeing Colin there. We talked for a while - I have no idea what about. Then we both had to get ready to go out (to seperate places). And we left, I think ym dream continued for a while longer, but I'm not sure.   Now like i said I love the dreams, I don't love the effects my dreams about Colin (we're on a first name basis :P ) has on me. The first one is that my near obsession of Colin is rekindled for the next few days / weeks. And it's even worse because I get the crazy fleeting thoughts like "what if he's having the same dreams as me - then whe he actually meets me we'll fall in love bla bla bla"    The second effect is that is rekindles my need to be a movie star, model or some other famous person. This one sucks just as hard becaust it makes me semi-depressed. I feel like my life is going to be less worthwhile because no one will know my name. I'll just be this little anonymous guy that convinces you to try the new brand of window cleaner.

      I think Aaron's sexist, though they don't usually use that word to describe queerness. He seemed to think that my one ... 'adventure' was worse than jess' 'adventure'. He seemed entirely reluctant to believe I was anything but a slut, he seemed to get irritated to think of anything other than that I was a slut. I think he just doesnt realise he's sexist. Or at least that's the excuse I'm using so I can stay his friend,  Reasons to: Because I always have  Reasons not to: No Fun Never helps me feel better Makes me feel bad Have nothing in common I never get to see  Well I never studied history so I don't know if it's worth it.

      Friday i was going to meet Adam for a drink then we'd go clubbing. But he got sick and gave me plentiful notice, so that's ok.  But then today i was supposed to meet Eddie for a movie. He was a no show, no message etc either. Though mikey (not me) had told me (me) that eddie has a tendancy to do that, and he had a party last night, so i was kinda prepared.   Ohwell big brother makes up for it

      Last night: Wow, i saw steve at the exam, and i didn't get all excited. I think i may finally be over him. I mean he didn't return my call, so i guess he's not into me. Tonight:  Me:Oh my god that was STEVE.  Jess: Steve? oh STEVE!   --- Yay STEVE!!!!!! (if you're reading this, call me, let's do brunch) --  Unrelated Sigh. I need to get some new friends, there are less than few people who i would describe my relationship as 'close'.  Hell you could count them on one finger. I think i way too similar to Lance Arthur. He is exactly what i will be in 20 years. He only just got his first relationship. Read about it  urlLink here  Now damnit! He's witty and insightful and what not. It's like me in that it sounds like he doesnt really know how to have a relationship (i'm not just referring to romantic, im talking about any).   Sigh im breaking my rule of no blogging after 11. You can see why the rule exits, i get whiney and incoherant. I can't be that bad if i can still say "incoher- inco- IncoHerAnt" Damn.

      He always makes me depressed. It's like "hey look at me I'm rich and famous - y'know everything that's important in life" Then I tell myself that those things aren't really what's impoirtant. It's happiness etc etc. I still don't believe it though.

       urlLink orkut.com  is a new social networking service named for the Google engineer who developed it, Orkut Buyukkokten. (Orkut is easier to spell and pronounce than Buyukkokten.) This was created as an independent project and is not part of the Google product portfolio.

      Now those you you that saw male and model together and jsut want to the the blurry noisy too bright pictures go  urlLink here  but for those you that want the previous post about my Steve translated continue reading.  Basically, last night me and ingrid went to a movie then i was telling ehr about the male model contest and she said she would go, so we went. We got there, looked at pretty males for about 5 minuits (that's how long they were on stage for) and then we danced for a while. All in all a pretty tame night right? Wrong! After that, as we were leaving, guess who I saw? that's right, the world's hottest male... Steve! he was leaving too, so I didn't get to say anything. But then it turned out he was just going to his car for a few seconds, then he turned around and came back! I managed to say "hey Steve." Impressed? Yeah, me neither. The impressive part came when I ... wait for it.. GAVE HIM MY NUMBER. Yeah ok, it wasn't actualy as in lets go on a date and have sex number it was a someone's organising something with the blokes, i'll give you a call when i know what number giving thing. exciting none the less, because it means i can run into him at the tav more foten now

       Don't Read this. Really, it's not coherant, goes off on tangents and just generally doesnt make much sense.  I know everyone's over me steve babble, but you're going to have to take two more posts of it, at a minimum. Now when I set off to write this post, I wanted to make it beautiful, descriptive and sexy. Then I remembered it was two AM, and what I create at two am and think is beautiful, looks like a drunk lumbering beefalo that's rolled around in glue, tar and a box of discarded meat. (how's that for graphic?) Ok now that you've had that mental image, time to juxtapose it with The Steve. You're standing there, and you see him walk out of the bar, but you're on the phone to you can't say anything. Whe you ge toff the phone you tunr to your best friend and go "Oh My God THAT was STEVE" then you stare at him for a few seconds before realising he's coming back. You gather you courage and manage to say the single coolest line in the world "Hey Steve". You have been thinking about him for an hour a day, being awestruck at his beauty, and general coolness. He, doesnt remember you. That's ok though, because th eonly time you talked to him he was off his nut. As you talk to him you study his features. Pale blue eyes, perfect nose, dark hair 5 o'clock shadow (on a tagent why does the word o'clock even exist? It's the stupedest word in the world, it has an apostrophe as the second symbol, rather than second last. Did they think they were being ironic by doing it backwards? or maybe it was cool back then) a perfectly trimmedgoatee, sitting on a perfect jaw just above perfect pecs covered by an armani shirt (how sexy is money? just kidding) You say hi, and shake hands, you talk for a while, and shake hande, you talk a bit longer, shake hands you give him your cell number, you scream in your head, say see ya , shake hands, talki a bit longer, shake hands, then part ways. Wow Oh yeah, and there were topless male models...but STEVE!!!! steve steve steve steve steve steve steve!!!!!

      I just saw Mogenic's new 'We're coming on the 6.6.04' page And i can't decide if i really like it or dislike it. It has lots of 80s / 90s feeling to it (especially in the grey background - how much more 90s can you get) The fonts are cool. I'm not sure about the people outliney things. I dunno, i'll make my mind up in 2 days

      I spent $135 on CDs and DVDs a few days ago (and now have about $30). I bought;    urlLink Fame   (5/10 value for money)  It's a not bad movie, but it takes a while to get started. It also there for takes a while to get you into the movie. The intro is kinda cool but it feels kinda disjointed to me. Probably just because I'm used to modern movies - though Citizen Kane was good.     urlLink Everything you wanted to know about sex*  *but were afraid to ask   (5/10 value for money)  I've only watched part of this but the first part i saw was rather boring, but the second part was pretty funny, so I will have to wait and see if it's goo(d).    urlLink Tigerland   (7/10 value for money)  It has Colin Farrell, and it has his screen test. Perfect.    urlLink Jamelia's Thank You   (8/10 value for money)  I LOVE Superstar, Thank You and See it in a Boy's Eyes. From the singles (those just listed) you'd think it was RnB / Pop, but it's more RnB... it's crazy. It's like expecting Celebrity and getting Justified.     urlLink Ministry of Sound's Sessions One   (13/10 value for money) WOW. This is why I impulse buy CDs incase i find something like this. Great mix of songs, great songs, mixed well. anyways i love it. It has all of the singles i was thinking of buying... well about 5 anyways. It's up there with This is me... Then and D-D-Don't Stop The Beat.   Two singles  (8 / 10 value for money) Both pretty good. Counting crow's accidentilly in love and Janet's all night.

      I blame evan for making me want to be an actor again. He asked if i'd ever felt like i really wanted to be an actor, and then we discussed it on and off, i REALLY wanted to discuss it but yeah. Sigh. I don't know what i want to do right now... would it hurt for me to take a year off uni and try acting scool? I'd probaby go to  urlLink  the ensemble theatre's school  because they teach based on the method, from what i've heard. I think that wouold be best for me, a nice developed system. It seems interesting, and -woah - my drama teacher went there (Mr O'brien if you're wondering) hmm... I'll think about it. I don't see how it would hurt to take a year off. *ponders*

      Dear Steve  I saw you with a Woman tonight. That seriously jeopardises our relationship. It means that we can't have sex, which would be OK, but it also mean we can't date. I would also be fine with that too, except for the combination of the two, that's the bad part. So I inform you that we can't have a relationship.  Well, unless she's a beard.   She can't be a beard though. A beard is another accessory, so it should make you look more attractive, right? However he had a tall, blonde beard. He is a short brunette, they totally don't match. he's thick and muscled, she is paper thin. It so doesn't work.   Sincerly You're rabid Fangrrl*, Mike  *According to Caroline and the 2001 censor of panda's  Hmm seeing steve with woman (that doesn't match) and then going home to see a romantinc comedy was a REALLY bad idea. Now i'm even MORE depressed.

      Well the two stars are good, but i'm sure that's just because Matthew McCaughnahey and Jennifer Lopez are cool. The rest of the cast are sub standard. but the script isn't bad so far.

      I really like that heading for this specific audience. I know that most of my friends have a very negative opinion of hollywood, on an unrelated note...'  What are the main reasons for staying friends with someone... what are good enough reasons for not being friends.  Someone that is disgusted by part of you, someone that's not much fun to be around, someone that doesnt have anything in common with you, who never instigates any activities with you, never calls... you get the idea

      So I'm inventing a device that will discover crevaces in the arctic. It bascially works by collecting space dust then shooting it towards the offending spot. If it cracks (and reveals three blank CDs and aniTunes Logo, and you fall on to a beach) it works. If you can't tell, i'm writing out my drems. I walked along this beach where i saw a mayan group of people doing something. i was kinda scared so i walked faster. Then realised i was waist deep in water so i yelled at the aboriginal groupd of people i was by "Little help?" The quickly obliged and took me into their area. Apparently there was a burial thing going on, hence and we had to lean over the water and do something, but i didn't know what and got kinda confused. Every one seemed happy though, so that was good. We then proceeded to sit down to a meal of mexican food - nachos tacos burritos etc. Later i left (and somehow appeared at the entrance to the wildlife park with Caroline and Erin)  We were going to go back to the camp so i could show it to them. There was a big sign sying something along the lines of "if you see any cockroaches please kill them for us, every little bit helps." We continued walking (and killing) untill we  eventually Erin dissapeared and we ended up at a little sitting eating area where there was a playground carved out of a rock. Now i think we ran into a famous children's book author. Caroline dissapears, something happens with children's books and colours, and then i'm in caroline's passenger seat recounting much of the experience to her. Then i pause and go "wait - you're driving - does that mean you got your Ps?" "yep, with a big grin" "then i give her a big hug while she's driving and she sweves a bit because of it.   The other dream is decidedly less remembered  We, my family and I, were on an elevator on a cruise ship that was also carrying some prisoners.Anyways we decided to sleep in an empty room towards the bottom of the ship (no I don't know why) At some late part of the night some people sneaked in to an empty room down the hall. We went to investigate. it sounded like they were planning to take over the ship! That's when they heard us. We then tried to hide, but they knew where we went so they threw some knives at us. I think they had a never ending ammount. After a while of this my brother did something that reminded them of some hero, whom they all stopped to remember for a few seconds, which gave us a chance to escape.
