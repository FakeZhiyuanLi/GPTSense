      i slept in at 10pm and woke up 5 hours later at 4am... lolz & wow... i didn't know that i could slept 5 hours only and still wake up all by myself !!!  anyways... that's a good thing... cuz i was suppose to meet jun hong at our soccer usual hangout later at 9am... but i wouldn't be kicking so much... cuz i still have to recover from the injury 1st right ?  but the bad thing is... that i was woke up from the sound of thunder... and when i signed in to Yahoo! instant messenger... the weather forecast all points to a thunderstorm... so i hope it will rain now and subside later...  yesterday i went to SSC for Counta-Striking with darren, wei hong and fairuz... wow i can't actually believe that a free frag (MF) could actually be soo good with his M4A1 or AK47... but i'll rather use my MAC10 or my TMP... (i developing a fondness of using submachine guns over rifles...) my sniping was... what i think... ok-ok lor... (my best sniper rifle is SCOUT...) but i still sucks at using AWP...  i think i'll need to improve my camping skill and accuracy... but then again... playing too much CS is bad for health... (LOLZ !!!)  there still 4 hours before i go out... so...  what should i do now ???

      well gonna run off to sembawang shopping center for another day of "Counta-Striking"... and it's gonna rain soon... lolz... whenever i tried to go out... the weather always seems to be working against me !!!  hope the recent unusual cool, rainy days wouldn't be there when i go to sentosa on June 9...  well i ain't going to change my blog template until someone submit a better template to blogskins or else... i would have to change the code myself... and my understanding of the codes is little 'til now...  haiz...

      My sleeping problem... perhaps not as bad as my friend Nic's... is somewhat irregular... i could sometimes sleep at 11pm or worse 4am... and would then wake up at around 5am to 2pm...  well that aside... i'm going to watch 'The Day After Tomorrow' on Wednesday at GV Yishun...  well... school will be starting soon... i hope nothing will go wrong...

      well planning to watch 'the day after tomorrow' (TDAT) on saturday at GV Yishun or perhaps maybe at Sun Plaza... well all that's after careful consideration that it would not  SERIOUSLY  hurt my budget for the Sentona trip on June 9...  i'm now playing some games on the PlayStation 2... namely  Winning Eleven 7 ,  Genso Suikoden III ,  Gran Turismo III A-Spec ,  Resident Evil: Outbreak  &  FIFA Soccer 2004 ... and also playing the PC version of both  Final Fantasy VII / VIII  since i can't find the PlayStation discs for both games... (did i lend it to somebody ???) and i'm anticipating the release of  Gran Turismo IV (end-2004 hopeful) ,  Genso Suikoden IV (Jan - Mar '05?)  &  Final Fantasy XII (Summer 2005... WOW ! What a long wait...)   about the other website I've constructed... I'm going to change it into something else... although I do not know the end-product will be... but it's still in it's early development stage...  it's 2:33am now... and i'm going to turn off my monitor and shift my attention to playing  Suikoden III ...  (P.S.: The Internet is a boring place to be in unless you've a blog of your own...)

      one thing that's for sure... my sleeping time is sure a screwed up version of most Singaporean... i could sleep at 9pm one day and 1am the next... i just can't get a proper sleep nowaday...  here's a rough example of my sleeping time...  Sleeping: 9pm ~ 3am Waking  : 5am ~ 2pm (explanation: one day i could sleep at 9pm, the other maybe 11pm or maybe 3am... same for the waking time...)  my sleeping and waking time varies too much liao... and when i could get a proper... i would always woke up cuz of external factors... something like raining (yesterday), my bro playing com (the day before...) or mosquitoes...  and wat's worse... i'm actually feeling sleepy as i type the post...  (P.S.: i'm planning to buy a notebook soon... anyone got a good suggestion... ?)

      downloaded  urlLink ePSXe  and its other plugins (like sound, graphic)... tried playing Suikoden II on it and i was a bit surprised that the emulator is better than the other like Bleem!... but still cannot get the game running like what it's suppose to look like if it's on the PS...  try changing the FPS about and found out that the best FPS for any PS game is around 50... (the default is 200 !!! how fast can that be... and what's worse... if i'm playing any game that have a ATB or real-time combat...with the FPS at 200... the game will be soo damn fast...)  abt the sentosa outing... heard from yin luan that maybe there will not be any overnight stay depending on the number of people wanting to stay overnight...  sianz sia... nothing to do...

      Two words to sum up for today, "Can't Sleep..."  can't sleep... dunno y... just can't sleep...  watched 'The Day After Tomorrow' yesterday and planning to watch 'Spiderman 2' next... but i think i'll have to save enough for Sentosa... right?  regarding the Sentona outing... i think i wouldn't be staying overnight (the possibility is abt 60%) cuz i was thinking the other day... what if i can't sleep... if i can't sleep... i'll hafta gaze at the stars  IF  the sky is clear... LOLZ !!!  well i think i'll have a maximum of SGD$50 for the outing... hope i wouldn't overspend cuz i'll also need the money to buy something else...  (possible item to be bought...) CS: Condition Zero (40%) The Sims Collector's Pack 2 (30%) Clothings (29%) Food (1%)  (LOLZ !!!)  one more week to the outing... not really looking forward to sunburning... lolz !!!  after i get back from the outing... i think i'll hafta re-adjust my sleeping schedule  IF  i stayed overnight...  ... and the rest of the three weeks of my final month of holiday will be spent preparing for the new school term... starting... er... i dunno... i will know the starting date once i go for the orientation at either 23, 24 or 25 June 2004...  (P.S.: Why did i put a 2004 at the end ??? it cuz my time is somewhat stuck at 2003... timelag...)

      AH!!!!!!!!!!  alright... 2day i got no lectures but 2 hours of tutorials and the rest were all either breaks or lab...  lemme sum up this whole week:  computing mathematics 1 : very very interested in it... essentials of inforcomm technology: ...alright- Web application development: Super-duper interested !!! Data Structure & Programming Techniques: HUH???!!! I dun get it... essentials of marketing: sounds too easy to be true... business communication 1: it might be hard for me... accounting fundamentals: "..."  the rest of the modules is alright alright lar except for...  DATA STRUCTURE & PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES !!!  Java Programming is too complex for my simple brain to 'tahan'...  so i borrowed books on Java 2 Programming from the NYP library with wee hong and kelvin (both r from DBI0406... and kelvin also happened to be from Peixin Primary...) wee hong borrowed all books from 'Sams publishing'... ha... next time instead of calling him 'Prince' bryan i can call him the 'Sams publisher supporter' (LAME!!!)  alright... the future looks a bit cloudy for me... maybe i just haf to work hard myself...  changed of mind...: i decided not to join kendo after i decided that i want to work almost everyday... so my onli active cca will be bowling and i heard from many sources tat it's $12 per session and 1 session per 2 weeks...  gtg liao... going arcade and play some arcade games...  and tml i gtg to causeway to take some photos cuz Audrey is migrating to Australia... and midway from the train ride back home, alf says tat he wouldn't be going tml... but the phone call bryan made changed all tat...  waiting for the bowling-cca-in-charge to contact me as well as the manager from edo sushi abt the schedule of my work... i hope to finalise my time management by... hopefully... next wednesday...  k going to shower den haf my dinner den go to the arcade liao... (and maybe play counter-strike or c&c generals but the counter-strike there is still 1.3 while the c&c generals they didn't update it to c&c generals zero hour... haiz... maybe playing red alert 2...

      okay... 1st day was a    BORE !!!   i'm sure tml can turn out to be better than 2day...  well...  spent a total of $18.30 for the business modules' notes... ( we [DBI0405] actually received notes for BM0030 and BM0031... we're suppose to collect the BM0032's note first thing on tml morning... ) and will be buying the IT modules notes by tml ( i will hafta get abt $15 ready... )and the book titled 'Essentials of Marketing' for the business module which cost around...    SGD $36 !!!   how @#^%$ expensive can tat be... $30 for the book and $6 for the online thingy...  so by tml... i would have spend at most $100 on things tat r needed for semester 1   ONLY...   wow... i think i need to cut back on my budget for this month...

      i went out to Marine Bay at abt 2:52pm and was suppose to meet my fellow classmates at Marina Bay MRT Control Station @ 4:00pm sharp... but... i over-estimated the time (i estimated tat the ride from Yishun to Marina Bay would take abt 45 mins to 1 hour but in the end... the ride was onli 40 mins long...) and was there since 3:30pm (a 30-mins long long wait... :x )  luckily i didn't hafta wait for long b4 my classmate starts arriving by groups... den finally we set off 20 mins late off our schedule time...  took a bus to get there... den after choosing over some restaurants to eat at... we managed to settle at one...  the price range was this:  -Adult $12 -Children $5  there was live crabs and prawns but i'm allergic to both of these so i nv eat a single one of them...  den our OGLs starts to come... PK arrive at around 6:00pm plus followed by Gary... he came at 7:45pm after everyone cannot tahan the food liao...  oh yeah i forgot abt it liao...  we also celebrated Michelle's b'day... (her nick's in IRC is dRaGoNLuV...)  den i and soon poh head to superbowl for 2 rounds of bowling... the 1st round was a joke... since i always took the 1st round as warm-ups so i did only a 99 for the 1st round... den 2nd round is back to my former self... 142... i thought my 1st round i lose form sia... but got a double at the 10th frame so i could get 99...  den we all play a round of pool... for $2... which continues on and on and on... qiqi, xiao qin and bobby are quite skill in their pool... but i'm more inclined towards bowling so i always lose to the three of them (btw... my victory over bobby was sheer luck... he wanted to hook the ball but it hit the black ( 8 ) ball and it went in... otherwise i was trailing him for like 4 balls...)  after that we went home...  !!! HOME SWEET HOME !!!  okay tat all of my updates... i too tired to type anymore... so...  i'll think of something else to write later after i finished watching Euro 2004 Semi-Final 2: Greece (Surprise !!!) versus Czech Republic...  my personal opinion is tat Czech will win this one... but den again... if Greece managed to snuff our their numerous attacks and could score via counter-attacking... den compact their defenses... den Greece will win...  (my guess: Greece 2 - 3 Czech Republic)  but i'm against soccer betting so i nv bet for this nor other matches...  cya...
