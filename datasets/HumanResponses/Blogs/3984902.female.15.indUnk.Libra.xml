      ...a supergod cries   Today is a new beginning for me. I know that sounds stupid, but it is. I'm starting my New Year's Resolutions in August. I'm going to push myself to succeed, but I'll know my own limits. I'm not going to try to please anyone but myself, because the people who truly care about me should be happy I'm happy.  And I'm finally happy. I have soccer tonight, and I love being active. I'm getting together with some friends this weekend who I haven't seen in a long time, and they're really my core group. I've known them since elementary school, and we know eachother so well that sometimes it's scary. :-)  Life is good because I'm making it good. No more wallowing in self-pity and depression.

      ...take my hand as we go down and down and down, I'm lookin' for water.    Didn't do too much today, but it wasn't bad for once. Woke up and played piano for a while, then practiced guitar. Ate a little breakfast, read part of a book, played some video games, sketched a little, then went to the doctor's. Blah, I hate the doctor's.   I'm actually lookin' forward to school starting. New clothes, new classes, fun stuff like that. I think I'm gonna start taking my camera to school to take pictures of people and places and just random things I see each day. I could kinda keep a photo journal or something on my computer. That'd be pretty cool. No offense to blogger, but I don't have much freedom to do stuff on this site without buying extra stuff. Same with Xanga. Oh well, we'll see.   Music of the day: Reality, David Bowie Movie of the day: Kill Bill vol. 1 (Vol. 2 comes out Aug 10!)

      *yawn* Current feeling: Boredom  Gah, I like having a break from school, but summer gets kinda boring nearing the end. I feel like writing something, but nothing's happened to me lately so everything I write sounds really dry and jaded.

      ...but now they're deeply buried in the past.   nothing really happened today. i woke up. i went on the computer. i waited for brett to come home. brett came home with a friend, so i just stayed on the computer. then watched some tv. then went to soccer, then came back here.  woo-fuckin-hoo.  i lead such an amazing life. and tomorrow i have to go to the frickin doctor's to get a physical. gah i hate those. oh well, at least it'll be over. then i won't have to go back for another year...or however long it is between those damn things.
