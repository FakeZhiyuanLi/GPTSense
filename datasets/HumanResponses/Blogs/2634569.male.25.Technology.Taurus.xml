      it's midnight on a saturday, well sunday now and while the rest of NYC is on their way out i'm on my way to bed  from the window of my second floor apartment i stand in my pajamas and watch as my neighbors and their friends leave the comforts of home for the night only to return early in the morning exhausted yet satisfied  i should go out i would go out if only i really knew what going out was, what it meant and how to go about doing it and also if there were others- friends with which i could say my time was spent  but here i stand looking out at a world that is passing me by and swallowing me whole  different people passing- coming and going but only one thought set in stone i wish i was going out tonight and i wish i wasn't alone

      a mind is a terrible thing to waste but i wish mine would leave me alone for a while because it is causing an internal struggle between itself and my heart  all you gotta do is say yes don't deny what you feel... the game is mind over matter and my mind don't feel like playin' 'cuz it does not like to lose and yet, it has never really won  so i am left always watching needing wanting but never fulfilling or fueling the dreams of the stone cold furnace lying within my soul longing to be ingited  i need internal peace and quiet unforced and unfabricated  thoughts  to run free in my brain those are the ones that will calm the storm and end the struggle  my heart is trying to win- it's up against a longtime companion and foe... it's mind over matter

      legs and arms- immobile body- aching mind- frazzled and confused Will- exhausted  my body is not used to this but it still tries and tries hard to get to where it wants to be and how it wants and needs to move  a dream deferred may end up shriveled like a raisin in the sun but a dream on the road to fulfillment is leaving me tired, afraid, optimistic & concerned as i am traveling down this road alone  like a dark victory my life is an oxymoron the glass is both half empty and half full  but i still truly believe it'll happen i'm just venting out of frustration no rest for the weary and no success for the well rested so with baby steps & wavering determination i forge ahead exhausted

      she moved in a while ago no face to face introductions only a conversing of slammed doors and glimpses of presence through light & movement  i'm forced to wonder about my new neighbor's occupation as once in a while is fine but coming home at 3 in the morning on a nightly basis is something i've never before been privy to and besides that, it interrupts my sleep  stripper? nah dj? maybe but definitely not a 9-5  never able to ask as our schedules are obviously conflicting but as my sleep was interrupted again last night my assumptions were clarified  3:15am- right on time click of the lock slam of the door switch of the light to a bright and fluorescent glow and an addition to tonite's repertoire...  a song slow, jazzy and sweet an obvious lasting residual of the evening's events  reminded me of Lutie Johnson in Ann Petry's "the street" who came alive at night in manhattan's night clubs a sassy songstress and other stories known to me as my reason for moving to NYC  she's an artist with a song to sing  and now her 3am arrival is no longer an interruption but a slow, sweet lullaby

      i have to admit, i'm upset right now whether it's at you or simply at the universe- i'm not quite sure i just know that i'm upset  you see, all my life i've had this thing i've come to know as faith faith in you faith in there actually being a purpose for me in this life faith that i'm not to spend the rest of my life asking questions  happiness seems to come in very short pieces of time or so it seems- at least recently i know i should count my blessings as they are now, and i do but i can remember a time when things made sense when i was always happy- and about everything now i find myself asking "what the fuck" or "what's the point" and "why... just why?"  why am i crippled i so many ways why can't i find the strength, courage & wisdom i need to surpass all this why do i have so many questions & so few answers and if you are a God that is too good for us to have fear, why am i always scared?  i keep believing & trusting that it'll all turn around & get better but i don't know how much longer i can last i know i'm here in this place & time for a reason but at this point it seems it's just to take up space  i still have faith but that candle begins to flicker more and more with each passing day as this bubble in which i am confined gets tighter and void of oxygen  i'd love to breathe again i'd love to be free again  so if you'd kindly burst this bubble and set this eagle free it would be GREATLY appreciated  thank you, will

      cds 3 dollars dvds 5 dollars how ' bout a Louis Vuitton bag for 35  knock offs cheaper than you can imagine sold from a blanket on 47th St. in Times Square NYC and almost every person walking by a tourist and potential buyer  "see somethin' you like miss?" i hear being said as i pass by "you have such nice stuff- ooohhh, Sarah, look at this one yes, i think i'll take-"  "shit, pack-it up, let's go!! FUCK! sorry, miss C'MON!!" and other words spoken in a foreign tongue  "wait- what about my bag? what happened?" she asks me i let my finger answer as i point to an officer in pursuit  "oh, the cops?" she asks, "that's the reason why?" i laugh to myself, a smirk on my face "Go Home" my only reply.

      vanilla ice cream chocolate chips caramel, fudge & cookie dough  search the contents within healing the parts that do not show  whatever emotions feelings hurt and anger that currently exist  are refreshed and restored back to normal just like the earth from a springtime mist  however temporary the gratification of this quick fix may last  each spoonfuls slowly and delectably leads my frustrations into the past  and although after this last bite i'll still be all alone  with a smile & face covered in ice cream i'll turn around and say hey look ma... no cone!

      ...the answer was no because you have over 300 friends and you don't need another  the answer was no because friendship's not where we were headed, you wanted a lover  i'm at a loss for words because i truly cared for you and i still do but our paths just crossed at the wrong time when neither one of us were ready  it hurt so much to say what i had to say and see the reaction on your face but it also hurt to hear your anger and feel your shade  i'm just extremely saddened and rather upset at the universe carrots dangled in my face and taken away so suddenly with no rhyme or reason what's the point where's the lesson why do i even try i meet someone i could potentially love but because of cicrumstance have to pass him by  and now, once again the drive has been fumbled as my ice cream's on the ground, & my sweet candy cone...crumpled.

      you've been running around in my head for almost a week now every minute. second. moment. in every task & every sentence I've allowed to enter my mind it has never been so good which is why now it hurts so bad  like a child given an ice cream cone i was ecstatic & you were all that mattered walking, talking, partaking, enjoying but i did not see that piece of earth up ahead waiting for my foot, waiting for my ice cream cone and TRIP - i fall  i rise shaken and stirred, cone still in hand but my long-awaited desert lies melting on the land neither one of our faults as it was part of life's plan but for reasons too complicated for me to understand  i've written about crying & my inability to do so now my tears are falling hard and fast and i sob for life's cruelty has grabbed me once again  uncontrolled by my emotions i forget i'm not alone as i'm reminded of what's left of the empty candy cone still lying in my hand just as sweet, just as good  i try to walk ahead looking back as i go wanting to pick up my ice cream, but instead must say no i'd like to move on with the cone & continue with the show but will the   cone   still want   me   now things are different?  don't know...

      awkward and usually uncomfortable hugs and salutations between strangers  is this coupling of people a date or just 2 friends meeting  for the first time  i'm never sure in these sit-uations  un certainty mysterious and elusive  but the evening goes on and so do the introductions  to:  personalities views nature and self  beauty i never knew existed amongst the trees and the lakes that make up the center of this city this universe  conversation in which I never knew I could engage amongst the cynicism and insecurity that make up the center of this mind this man  comfort and calm i never knew i could feel amongst the turbulence and inexperience that make up the center of this existence this life  burgers and fries willow trees and mosquito flies seductive conversing of eyes and i find myself at peace  not wanting to say goodbye  alas all great things must come to an end  a lovely early evening in Central Park a budding friendship a chance to see you again  certainty  no longer a mystery  as our  introductions   are now a part of history

        Funk    April 20, 2004   This mood I'm in  Nothin's happened - everything's normal As normal as it always has been but not really as normal as it should be  It's hard to explain I can't even explain it to myself let alone provide an answer to your prodding questions Getting Late playing over, and over Not simply because it's good, but because it's somewhat sad And right now, sad seems to be what I can relate to the most  It's not what's being said but how  It's not the rhythm of the music but how the vibe and delivery of the words match the melody of the song and how the melody matches the current state of my soul  I wanna cry... but never can  "How's about I let you Touch this space that you left behind The day that you stopped smiling The day that the tears started falling..."  I've been here before I recognize this feeling I could start crying at any moment And wouldn't be able to tell you why  It's a scary and unsetling feeling, really But also comfortable and familiar  Where's that smile You know, the one from not too long ago un-forced, un-fabricated Genuine and real  Lost. at least for the moment In this Funk

        Incense and Happiness    April 5, 2004   It all begins with a match a match in your hand or within your soul suddenly sparking the fire's ignited Let it burn  Smoke stemming from the root The party has started Much like the smoke rising you're flying Sometimes calmly and sensually Sometimes vibrantly Always from the same place never un satisfying but never completely gratifying  Rising Flowing Living Glowing Each smoke signal off to find a different part of the room Each action off to find a different part of life And the ashes that are left behind go unnoticed Let it burn  The stick is getting shorter but the smoke is releasing faster and hotter than before the smell more intense the smile even brighter and the feeling of joy and peace insurmountable  It's over- the smoke's gone Now all that's left are ashes and memories The scent is still strong but it's not enough Time for more Where's the box?  Push the ashes aside Deal with them later I need a new stick NOW They were never really that important anyway They're just the remains of my life and what matters is now and not then, right?  Sweet, there's the box Yes, a nice long-lasting stick will do this time All set It's time to Let it burn Now all I need is a  Shit, I'm outta matches And what the fuck's with all these ashes...

        Goodbye    Jan. 30, 2004   You came into my life and turned it all around Like morning you presented a brand new day And created a brand new me Filled with change, hope and opportunity  You lifted me higher than I ever thought I could go Yet disappeared so suddenly leaving me with nothing But memories And while memories are great My heart, like the Grand Canyon, remains empty Longing for completion once again  Laughing together until tears streamed from our eyes And crying ourselves to sleep only to see you later in my dreams Were the greatest experiences of my life Now you’re gone and what you created seems to have died  When I see you now, you’re different Like you and I were never WE I never was as quick as you Blinded by love I guess The fire’s almost out; is it even burning at all? Or are my eyes just showing me a glimpse of the flame we once shared A flame long extinguished in your soul, but burning strong in mine  You’ve found new love I guess it’s time for me to do the same But before I go Thank you For everything Thank you for me And most of all, Thank you for this lesson  I know I’ll be seeing you again Only now through different eyes You have nothing more to offer me So consider this last Thank You- Goodbye.

        Chicken Shit    October 21, 2003   My phone book gets increasingly larger with numbers I won't call Why is that? My experiences fewer and fewer cuz I'm too afraid to fall Why is that? Countless nights and weekends are spent just home alone Why is that? Rumaging through the numbers of my un-used telephone When out with friends and mates I have nothing at all to say Why is that? Yet the pages of this journal grow fuller and fuller each day So many dreams and aspirations, yet all I do is sit Why is that? I'll tell you in 2 words simply, it's cuz I'm Chicken Shit!

        Untitled    June 19, 2003   "You're going to Hell!" they chant, "That's your punishment for being gay" "You're going to Hell!" I chant, that's your punishment for the words you say This "sin" as you call it is something I didn't choose You don't know me but you hate me, I can tell- I see your work on the nightly news Matthew Shephard & countless others taken way before their time By you claiming to be doing "God's Word," um.... no, it's called a Hate Crime! We'll stand before the gates of Heaven waiting to get in You'll get to the front, they'll pause and say, "Wait... You violated one of the 10" So let's not judge or fight each other for the battle is already won For God has room for all of us You his straight daughter, and me his gay son.

        Dues    June 5, 2003   50 Dollars Broken Bones Maybe even 5 years to life These things we pay, we call our "Dues", for everyone a different price Some pay little, some pay more; we pay forever- or so it seems To claim a reality we've wanted since childhood, you remember- your life-long dreams For me, my dues come in different forms like insecurity, fear or a worthless job In fact they're the inspiration for these words swimming around in my head like a blob I watch tv or a picture show wishing it was me Attempts of suppression never really work when it comes to jealousy or envy But soon my time will come and I'll be free from all this bull And then I'll recieve a statement that reads... "Your Dues are paid in FULL!"

        No One Told Me    June 3, 2003   No one told me life would be easy No one told me life would be hard No one told me the deck of cards I'd be dealt would keep me isolated and sometimes scarred No one told me that I'd be gay and live most of my youth in seclusion And while harsh words & threats fostered fear, no one told me that fear was an illusion No one told me I'd want so much No one told me I'd need so little And as far as Black or White was concerned, no one told me I'd be stuck in the middle No one told me that I'd be odd or that I'd be odd for a reason And after giving up on the idea of being a late bloomer, no one told me every flower has it's own season No one told me that I'd be happy No one told me that I'd be blessed And while thinking of what the future could hold No one told me I'd forget the rest.

        Sexual Timebomb    May 28, 2003   I am a sexual timebomb ready to explode My virginity's got me trapped craving to blow my load I swear I'm not a prude- I just don't wanna die For something so hot that feels so good inside "Masturbate" you say, "That'll make you feel much better" Been there, done that, I only wake up wetter So many thoughts are running through my head Like the one where I see myself taking you to bed Sexual frustration is something everyone goes through Sex is the one thing we all have in common, but my problem is... with who? I can't believe I'm writing this down, it's actually kind of fun And safer and easier that chatting with someone named "FuckmetilIcum."

      purposed as a quick means of escape used as a permanent escape from reality most of my time spent in another world daydreaming  realities get too complicated and can often be unsatisfying too often  there are no questions in daydreaming that go unanswered the hero always slays the dragon  CONTROL  gears shifted, paths traveled by a thought send in one direction as opposed to another does he find purpose? does he get the boy? in reality no one knows and since my reality is offers no answers with my daydreams i cure my woes  ...but i'm tired of getting through life in dreams

      a picture says a thousand words this one says i was young once a baby an infant a newborn a child  fresh from the womb far from the tomb this little boy whom we've come to know as Will or Nyerere if you're family  memories i never knew i had songs i never knew i sang movies i never knew i made a life i always knew was fun  i was a baby once the proof is here in my lap and after 25 years of living my first glance at my baby pictures close the gap  how i got to this man from that newborn holding back tears, i finally understood these pictures show a bouncing baby boy these pictures show my happy childhood.
