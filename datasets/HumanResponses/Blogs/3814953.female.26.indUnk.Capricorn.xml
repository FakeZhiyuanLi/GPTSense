         Oh how I feel for someone! Somehow, things are coming up roses for me lately. But then I could not feel all that good because one of the people very close to me is not feeling so good lately. Just remember that this too, shall pass. There is a rainbow waiting after a storm. Just hang on in there. You’ll get by! =)          I wasn’t able to get a confirmation for my flight on Friday. So I’m leaving Saturday, which is a good thing, because I haven’t packed anything yet!

         PR and I went to the cemetery to visit Carlo after we had lunch in Luisita. I sneaked in a few minutes to visit my lolo and my youngest brother who didn’t make it to see the world, leaving a few minutes of quality time for PR and Carlo. I haven’t been to Carlo’s since the time he playfully “logged-in” to yahoo messenger a few weeks ago. Although I’m quite positive that it wasn’t really him who logged in, but he usually does things that would really make his presence felt. Like making the bathroom feel so cold the night we went to his wake; like on our first night in Boracay, he visited me and my sister Ann, in our dreams a few minutes before we wake up and Voltz almost choking to death that same morning. Before he left us, he was telling me to move our trip a week early (the week after holy week), since he and his friends were booked that week so we could all hang-out by the beach, but I told him to move theirs instead, but he didn’t want to kase the week after holy week is the best time to go. So maybe, his way of visiting us in our dreams is one of his kind ways to give in to my request. And maybe, Voltz’ choking incident is his way of fooling around with our “queer” friend. I heard a lot of stories from PR too, mostly, visiting all his friends in same-scenario dreams. So there, I hope PR and I were able to amuse you again with our girl-talk, Carlo! Now you know my secrets! =)

         I went to see dentist #1 this morning to have one of my teeth fixed. There’s nothing wrong really. It’s just that while I was flossing one night, I accidentally pulled a part of the tooth, which made it kinda cracked. Turned out, dentist #2, the one who did it before didn’t do a very good “pasta” job. I knew there is something wrong with the procedure. In the 4 years that I dated dentist #3, he was able to explain to me how a good dental procedure is done and what type of materials are used so somehow, I know a good job when I see one. Anyway, just to end a confusing story, I am thankful to dentist #1. He was able save my tooth!

         I watched Mean Girls last weekend. After the movie, it made me think of all the mean things I did back in grade school. I was a very bad girl before. In 1 st  grade, where I was class president, I made the boys eat chalks, you know, the white thing used to write on blackboards, when they do not want to keep quiet. I hit their hands with a stick when their hands wouldn’t be on their tables. I did all these without being scolded by the teacher because she asked me to do that and I kinda abused the “power” given to me.         In 4 th  grade, when the boys moved to Don Bosco, making our school exclusive to girls, cat fights were the “in” thing. And as far as I remember, I was in it in almost everytime. We would pass notes to each other and agree to see each other at the back of the canteen or the back of the stage, wherever there are no passersby. We would call each other names, pick on each other’s flaws, sometimes, there’s even slapping of the face and there was one time I even splashed the drink I had in hand to my enemy’s face (I know, I’m bad!). And all these fights started because of the famous “head-to-toe-look”!          I did so many bad things before and maybe as time went by, I was able to forget all the bad things I’ve done towards other people. One of my friends who live in   Florida   now told me that in 6 th  grade, we sort of made another girl carry our bags for us. Grabe, I was really, really bad!             In highschool, I started to change when I started to mature. I realized that if I continue to do all the mean things I do, people would hate me and I wouldn’t have friends. Good thing, some people gave me the chance to prove that I’m not all that bad. Instead of idolizing Cherie Gil in all the movies she did with Sharon Cuneta, I started leaning over to   Sharon  ’s character. =)          A lot of my friends, people who are very close to me would always come to my defense now and tell people who do not buy the “new” Ricci, how much I’ve changed from a bruhilda to somebody normal =). It’s funny how it’s so humbling that these people who were once my enemies, who are now some of my closest friends, would come to my defense.          Changing is hard. The transition is harder. As I struggle day by day to change into a better me, I meet some people along the way who really try very hard to test my patience. There are times when I wanted to give up, thinking that becoming a good person is not a good idea because there will always be people who would want to hurt you and pull you down. But when I get back to my senses, the realization that if I keep up with what I have started (changing for the better), in no time, I would get there.         So now, I would want to say sorry to all my grade school and high school classmates, who in one way or the other, I’ve hurt intentionally or unintentionally. I would really want to write all your names but you are just too many! =) I hope you find it in your hearts to forgive whatever childishness I have done to hurt you.         There is a “mean girl” in each of us. Sometimes, we’re just too proud to acknowledge the fact.

       I just want to share this with you. Being the eldest among 4 siblings, I could definitely relate!       This is an ex cerpt from an article by Minotte Rodrigo-Cuenca of The Philippine Star, published on May 27, 2003:           Birth  order is one way to gain an understanding of our children, friends,     family  members  and  ourselves. Discover how personality is influenced by     your  position  in the family. Whether you're the firstborn in the family,   middle   or   only  child,  find  out  what  your  (and  your  children's)     predispositions are from Dr. Kevin Leman, author of The Birth Order Book.          FIRSTBORNS                                                                                                                    Firstborns tend to be highly motivated to achieve. Of the first 23             astronauts sent into outer space, 21 were firstborns or only children.                                                                                       Positive traits: They are natural leaders and often high achievers. The        majority of politicians, spokespersons and managing directors are              firstborns. They frequently live with a sense of entitlement and even          superiority, they sometimes don't have to prove themselves. They often         come in two flavors: Compliant nurturers/caregivers (the ates) or              aggressive movers and shakers (the kuyas). Both are in control; they just      use different methods. As a rule, firstborns are picky, precise people and     have difficulty adjusting. They pay attention to detail, tend to be            punctual, organized, and competent. They want to see things done right the   first time.                                                                                                                                                  Negative traits: They don't like surprises and have to learn how to            express more emotion. They are often moody and occasionally lack               sensitivity. They can be intimidating and pushy. Sometimes they can be a       bit "know-it-all," and often, they are poor at delegating ? largely            because they don't trust other people as much as themselves. They also       tend to be bossy, perfectionists and overly-conscientious.                                                                                                   Parenting tip: According to www.parenting.com, the oldest or only child        tends to be a "discouraged perfectionist," setting impossible standards      for himself, and may be at risk for burning out in the future.                 Acknowledgement and praise come naturally their way. Encourage these           children, however, to lower the bar so that real success is not an             impossible dream. Learning to settle for excellence (as opposed to             perfection) makes life happier and more fulfilling. Enroll them in sports      where they can express their competitive streak and where they may learn       teamwork and how to lose graciously (and not take himself too seriously)       as well.

          As much as I didn’t want to make my page views exclusive to my friends, I had no choice but to do that. I realized that my profile is attracting negative reactions from some people. So at least now, only my friends can read my profile. What’s so sad about it is that friendster is supposed to be for making friends or finding long lost friends. Not a way to make enemies! But still, I am thankful to these so-called  “fiendsters,”  who makes me feel all the more special because they really take the time out to make bogus accounts. I hope they find peace and happiness in their hearts. You see, there are so many things to be grateful about to even think of trying to make somebody else’s life miserable.

      Behrouz in Greenhills. I just so love their Chelo Kebab! But they have a set meal that has 2 Kebabs and a plateful of steamed rice that’s called Chelo Barq I think. That’s what I usually get. I heard their calf’s brain is very good too. And price is very reasonable! A bandihado-full of rice with butter plus two Kebabs, plus their yogurt sauce = One Very Happy and Very Full Ricci!   Causeway in Banawe. Dimsum is super delish! I love their bean curd thingy. The most authentic Chinese food you can get in this side of the city! Price is cheap too!  Jade Garden. I love their Steamed lapu-lapu and their 3-way duck. Nothing compares!  Burger King. I don’t know if they have the Burger Beefsteak meal anywhere else in the world where there is Burger King. But I’m glad they have it here. It is a 2-piece burger patty on a bed of rice, served with beefsteak sauce. I always eat it with French fries. Yeah, I know, my tastebuds are weird! There was even a time, when my parents are went to Manila without me, since we do not have Burger King in Tarlac, I called them to buy 2 orders for me. I was so excited to meet them up in the garage when they got home. But to my disappointment, they weren’t able to buy. I got sooo mad, I cried! =)   Taco Bell. I could eat as much as five taco bell supreme without tomatoes plus their mild hot sauce in one seating. Yummy! Everytime I get to LAX, the first stop would always be.. you guessed it, Taco Bell!!  Europa’s Deli. I loooove their Hungarian beef and their special garlic rice that is mixed with butter. I swear, I could not eat garlic rice at all because I hate how the garlic tastes like when I bite on it but Europa’s rice is an exemption. You will never see the garlic. But it tastes like garlic!  Jollibee. Jolly hotdog + French fries + spaghetti + coke in can = Perfect combination!   Siapno’s in Pangasinan. A trip to Manaoag will never be the same without eating lunch at Siapno’s. They charge more than their counterparts, but I swear the way they cook their food is way better than the rest. Their sinigang na Malaga is the best. And the halabos na hipon, and the juicy inihaw na baboy! Not to forget, their inihaw na bangus is very good as well! They give free coconut candies/pastillas also when you pay the bill.  East Ocean in Greenhills. This restaurant closed so many years ago. But I still consider it as one of my favorites. I could only remember their steamed shrimps that are just so sweet! And their spicy crabs that is so yummy! Their 3-way duck is the best also. Now, I could only reminisce about the good old taste! =)  Hongkong’s sidewalk restaurants. The adventurous side of me is the one talking here. My family would always welcome the idea of trying new restaurants that is why good food hunting is always fun for us. There are a lot of sidewalk restos that are very good in HK, although the utensils are not cleaned properly and the service is really bad. But I guess the real come on is that of some customers spitting on the floor while you eat! =)  Tommy’s. My God, if there’s anything that smells like a stinky armpit but is heavenly delicious, it must be Tommy’s! I love their double cheeseburger without onions and pickles and chili fries. Sometimes I would think twice if I could finish a whole burger because of its humongous size. But most of the time, I would prove myself wrong. It must be the chili sauce! Oh how I love it!  Uva. Their food, I do not fancy that much because it is fusion. But I love their Chocnut Ice cream! It’s like tasting a bit of heaven in every bite!  Arirang. I just soo love Korean food! Arirang’s bulgogi is unlike any other bulgogis! And their Kimchi is to die for. Oh and how I love their free side dishes! The pickled spinach and cucumber! Too bad they closed their Philippine franchise. The closest you could get a taste of it is in HK! Arirang brings back a lot of wonderful childhood memories. Every Christmas, we were always waiting for them to open for dinner every single day we were in HI Golden Mile. We would walk all the way to Ocean Terminal just so we could eat there. We, the kids, loved how we could grill what we eat. And everytime, we would brave thru the long walks and the cold nights eventhough how our kiddie feet hurts! And during Christmas, they would give free Pineapple sorbets for dessert! Oh how I love that sorbet! They do not make them anymore these days. But I could still taste it like I did so many years ago! And on our way back to the hotel, when Redo and Ann were still babies, the yaya and dad would take turns in carrying them because they were already tired and sleepy while John holds mommy’s hand and I hold on to daddy’s belt loops so that we wouldn’t get lost! By the time we get settled back in our rooms, we are hungry again! =) Maybe that’s why I love the restaurant so much. Excellent food + wonderful childhood memories = the best restaurant for Ricci.  Actually, I have a lot more favorite restaurants. I am just tired of writing. And I am getting hungry and frustrated because I know I could not eat what I want tonight because I am in Tarlac! Anyway, more to come next time. =)

      Yesterday, JI and I had lunch. We were together for 11 whole hours! And all we did was talk and eat and drink and talk. Actually, JI did most of the talking, as usual! =) Then MM followed. I enjoyed spending the day with them so much that I am thankful I did not have an 8-5 job! (Not that it’s a bad thing, okay, I’m just thankful!).  J2 dropped by for dinner. She is in deep shit! But just when I thought I’ve had enough girl-talk to last me a week, 30 minutes after I got home, J2 called. She talked about her love problems. I didn’t know how to calm her down or to make things at least a little better for her that we didn’t notice the time! My God! It was already 2:30am when we finally put down the phone! And I still have to shower! At last, I was able to sleep at 3am!  When I woke up this morning with barely 5 hours of sleep, I sort of blamed J2 for depriving me of my precious 8-hour sleep! =) I just could not function very well! I really hope J2 could fix the mess she’s gotten herself into real soon. Or else, I will be the one to fix it and kick Pumpkin’s ass off again! =)  And so, with all the pressures from work, the sad love stories and the puyat I’ve been having and hearing the past few days, I decided to succumb to what my body is telling me. I had a massage! The two-hour pure indulgence I had this afternoon certainly calmed my tensed muscles. Haaay, sarap! Thank God for Mariet (the masahista)!

      I have not always been the fuzzy-girly type. That is why people think I’m a bit aloof. Many people do not like me because of this. And I don’t blame them. I do not expect people to like me. And I don’t make an effort for them to do so. But I am always polite.  In life, you seldom find true friends who will be there for you through it all. There are some who masks themselves in beautiful, decorative, sparkling packages that would make you feel that you have found the perfect friend. Only to find out how rotten they really are underneath.  One of my best friends called me up today. After a long time of not talking to each other (we had issues) she finally gave up her pride and warmed up to me. She said that she was sorry for taking me for granted after all these months. And that she has now found out who her true friends are. As she was talking, I started to cry. Hearing her say all those things about how I have become a friend to her through thick and thin, touched me. I am not one who makes “beso” whenever I see my friends or hug my friends or hold my friend’s hand while walking or even say I love you to a friend. So you could just imagine what it could take for me to become mushy!   Of all my friends, there are only a handful of people to whom I could trust my dear life with, including this girl. And I feel so blessed that I have true friends. They are the ones who knows the real me. They are always there to fight for me, when I feel weak enough to fight for myself. They are always there to listen to me, even though sometimes, my stories are never-ending! They are always there to give good advices and it’s up to me to take their advices or leave it. They are always there when I need comfort. They’ve seen the worst of me, heard every whine and gripe, knows me inside out and yet, they are still there, still accepting and loving me just as I am.  I am so grateful that God has given me all my friends. My life has become richer with every friendship I share with them!

      I hate pop-ups! For a month now, Tickle.com’s windows keep popping out of my screen. But today, instead of hitting the X button, something caught my attention. A free IQ test! Lately, I am really bothered about how I am doing intellectually. Since I am always at home and watching TV, I had “doubts” that I’ve become dumb! =) Although I am making my best effort to keep myself well-read in every aspect. Anyway, I took 3 tests. Two of which are IQ tests and one Career Interest Inventory. Here are the results:  CLASSIC IQ TEST: Congratulations, ricci! Your IQ score is 118  This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others.  Your Intellectual Type is Insightful Linguist. This means you are highly intelligent and have the natural fluency of a writer and the visual and spatial strengths of an artist. Those skills contribute to your creative and expressive mind. And that's just some of what we know about you from your test results.  SUPER IQ TEST The Super IQ Test How Smart Are You Really?  Welcome to Tickle's Super IQ Test — the most accurate, comprehensive, and thorough intelligence assessment of its kind and an in-depth version of our famous Classic IQ Test. Previously offered only to corporations, schools, and certified professionals — this highly accurate intelligence assessment test is now available to you directly from Tickle.  In addition to measuring your IQ, the Super IQ Test also assesses how well you score in 8 different areas of intelligence to uncover your key intellectual strengths and what they reveal about you.  Developed by PhDs, our exclusive Super IQ test is free, private, and reflects the best research available.  RESULT: ricci, your Super IQ score is 106  Your overall intelligence quotient is the result of a scientifically-tested formula based on how many questions you answered correctly. But it's only part of what we learned about you from your answers on the test. We also determined the way you process information.  The way you think about things makes you a Concrete Thinker. This means your intelligence is grounded in a clear understanding of what is happening around you. In situations where others are confused, things are crystal clear to you. In addition, you have the unusual combination of strong verbal and numerical skills. You are able to solve equations and then use your verbal skills to explain those solutions to others.  How did we determine that your thinking style is that of a Concrete Thinker? When we examined your test results further, we analyzed how you scored on 8 dimensions of intelligence: spatial, organizational, abstract reasoning, logical, mechanical, verbal, visual and numerical. The 3 dimensions you scored highest on combine to make you a Concrete Thinker. Only 6 out of 1,000 people have this rare combination of abilities.   CAREER INTEREST INVENTORY ricci, based on your responses, your top career area is Business Relations  Careers in this field often demand that you possess keen observational skills and shrewd thinking. Being successful in this area involves anticipating your opponent's goals and client's needs. Most likely, you enjoy the challenge of quick thinking and taking calculated risks.  Okay, here are my results. I don’t know if they are good or bad, but at least I’m still doing okay. My IQ in college, maybe it’s the same as that of Tickle’s Super IQ Test, is somewhere between 119 to 124. I dunno what happened now. Diba defensive? Haha! I better start eating more brain food like chocolates… Haha! Speaking of chocolates, this is what’s making me smile in the morning… Macadamia nut-covered chocolates (grabe, i'm cheap!)… I eat a boxful everyday, which is about 600kcal! Maybe tomorrow, I have to eat 2 boxes-full! =)

        Mom and dad had a date with me and Redo in Glorietta. We tried the new Japanese/Korean resto where Furusato used to be. I forgot the name of the restaurant but Redo could only laugh at disbelief why they actually named it that. The weekly 2 hour drive to Glorietta is always a bonding time with my parents. Daddy always tells us that it is the only time when he could gather all his children in one place and not have any way out. Redo tried to wrestle with me a couple of times because I was telling on him! =) Too bad Ann and John didn’t go with us. Ann, as usual is tamad to go and John is with his girlfriend.   We went to Pricesmart after we dropped off the baby in the condo. Mommy wanted to buy this weighing scale but when she tried it, she got so mad at it and called it a liar! =)    The ride home was a breeze! Dad, mom and I were too absorbed in the conversation that we were surprised we were already home!   This is why I love Sundays! It is not always how fabulous or festive a get-together should be. But the laughter, the squabbles, the kwentuhan, the just being there as a family that makes us all look forward to yet, another family day!

      It was a relief that I finally attended the Jaycee meeting last night after a long time. Our guest speaker was the 1st ever lady politician elected to that post in Tarlac. I forgot if I actually voted for her last elections but I’m glad she won.   I had a hot choco and Belgian waffles to satisfy my sweet tooth at 11pm! with J2 and MD at Starbuck’s. It is such a heavenly treat! Who cares about calories! =)  The ribs we had for lunch tasted like steak! Yumyum! I think I overate again! =(  Bonding with my baby bro – Redo! He’s sick!

      There are nights like this when my mind is so full of wonderful thoughts that I would want to share to people I care about. Nights when I think of amazing friendships with people who has made my life more meaningful. Nights when I am overwhelmed with so much blessings the Lord has given me. And so, after all the complaining on my previous online journal, I decided to make one that would celebrate all the wonderful things I am blessed with.

      A friend sent me this email. I thought it was nice so I just want to share it with you!   Did you know that when you envy someone, it's because you really like that person?  Did you know that those who appear to be very strong in heart, are realweaklings and most susceptible?  Did you know that those who spend their time protecting others are the ones thatreally need some one to protect them?  Did you know that the three most difficult things to say are: I love you, Sorryand help me The people who say these are those that actually need them or reallyfeel them, and they are the ones you really need to treasure, because they have said them.
