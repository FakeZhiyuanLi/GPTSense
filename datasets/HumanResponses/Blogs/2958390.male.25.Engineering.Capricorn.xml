            A LITTLE BIT ABOUT mEf.... I GOT MY NICKNAME "mEf" WAY BACK IN DECEMBER 1995. ((mEfStEr WOULD THEN BE AN ALIAS BY 1996)) IT WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A GRAFFITI WRITER NAME. THIS WAS AROUND THE FIRST TIME I DROPPED ACID. I "DROPPED" OFF AND ON FROM LATE '95 TIL ABOUT MID '98. WHEN I HAD EXPERIENCED A "BAD TRIP" SHORTLY BEFORE I HAD QUIT ACID, I TRIED SHROOMS. SOON AFTER, MY ACID DAYS WERE OVER. I HAD FOUND MY TRUE HALLUCINOGEN OF CHOICE; PSILOCYBIN MUSHROOMS. UP TO THIS DATE, I HAVE ONLY TRIPPED ON SHROOMS ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES. THERE IS SOMETHING MAGICAL THAT HAPPENS TO ME WHEN I EAT SHROOMS, I AM SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED. THINGS IN GENERAL SEEM SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING, I GET ALOT OF MY INSPIRATION FROM THESE "TRIPS" AFTER THEY HAVE HAPPENED. I ALSO SMOKE ALOT OF CANNABIS, I HAVE BEEN SMOKING WEED SINCE AROUND LATE 1994.

        It was a beautiful day today, no rain just sunshine! Unfortunately, I didn't have anything to do tonight. Well I could've went to a party but I decided not to go. I went to the movies on Friday, I saw  "Dawn of the Dead"  I thought it was pretty good, It is typical of me to like zombie movies but this one was a good one. After the movie I went to take a walk in the neighborhood, to see who was around; then I went by my friend's house. We were just chilli'n in his attic drinking beers with some of my other friend's, who also came by. I stayed there until 2AM or so. I talked to a few people earlier today, and there wasn't much going on. Everyone was out and about, it was like 65 degrees today, spring is almost here! Well I guess I will just play it by ear right now, and see if anything happens tonight. Because, people always have a habit of calling me last minute, to go out and do something. Well that's it for right now.  Laterz   ~~mEf....

        Here is an excerpt from my friend's personal writings ~NAmiXmiO ZEnLAzoG~  (M.G.)    Sitting on a foreign couch, in a foreign room, in a foreign house; with a familiar friend, one of few of my brotheron, whose friendship and companionship is more fulfilling and addicting than cocaine or injected heroin. Through my blood make it bubble and boil. It's the love and respect I have for my brotheron making my soul and body shudder; making me see clear, removing from my mind is all this clutter. Purifying my thoughts, my flesh, my spirit, for I need to prepare my solid, but fragile weak me for the wicked world, that almost killed me in the past. When my mind was full of intellect but not yet stable, where my body was a slave to pleasure and sin. Where my spirit, so weak it was easily manipulated and embraced and into the arms of evil. So naive, believed everything that was fed to me/forced-fed to me. I ran with the crowd, wore it's fashion, talked the talk, walk the board walk. And at this point when I was a phony, fixated, pathetic poser; I should have been on the concrete, an outline made of chalk. But after many heavy hits, I woke up and realized I am not a machine . Though, for a time I operated like one.

         " The Terra Revolution and Venus "     People must never be afraid of the paths chosen by God.... In their hearts, they see the  path so much more clearly and truthfully than even the eyes. But in time, the tempting beautiful body only as far as the eyes will in time, come to pass. Today I burn under my brains consciences of what propels me out of trouble at times into Time itself, outside into the space of it all.... My body cannot breathe  there... What is my mind doing there? Why is my soul surpassing curious, egos, security, etc., going as fast as the speed of thought. The fastest and longest far reaching thing we know. Long ago sleepless nights would drift in with their bags and books of wonderment's and self debates.... Not of myself but of stars, music, Saturn's rings astro-notions. Before  L.S.D.  there were visions of eternities....   So many blisters un-medicated, unraped by human eyes as today on all across this Earth and through this house and home. That need not be explained to you but to the Devil.. The truth shall be to all.... The will to accept the truth must be fed, never suspiciously bled. It's just that we must prepare for one.... The amazement in how the truth shall be presented.   Nature shows more than anything and it does get pretty amazing. What's sometimes more amazing is how, people miss the warnings of tidal waves, Volcanoes....Earthquakes, etc... I know inside they pretend to miss the message we really could not care for our children. How can you push it back on yourself in the long run?    As we feel.. Eventually, we shall be our own children....

          St. Patrick's Day     Yeah I haven't updated in a few days or so. I have been so busy lately, right now I'm writing this; and drinking some dEw. I am going to be posting my friend's poetry on this page within the next day or two. He goes by the name of; ~NAmiXmiO ZEnLAzOg~ Anyway, he saw my page and he said it would be great if I could put his stuff here. So I agreed to do just that, when I get the time. I mean this page is supposed to be about mEf, but I feel that my friend's are a part of this inspiration.

        ...:::ThE 36 hOUr BiNgE:::..      I  t was  Friday March 12, 2004 . I woke up around noon, as a result of whatever I did the previous night; which I don't remember. Anyways, I got  sToNEd  around two 'O clock or so, it was some really good  [@nn@bi$.     2:00 P.M.- 8:00 P.M.*  NoThiNg MuCh GoiNg On ArOuNd ThiS tiME....          Just got $t[]nEd;/   9:00 P.M.*  I was sitting around listening to some HEnDriX and, a friend called my cEll around 9:05 and asked me if I was going to do anything tonight. And I said, I don't know? So I hung up or whatever.   * Around ten 'O clock  my friend called me back and said she was on her way to pick me up. So we had talked and decided to go by my good friend's and chill. My friend was there and, he was waiting for someone to to drop off some  "y@Yo"  So I did about two nice r @i\_$  and drank some beers. There were about 6 of us chilli'n by my friend's we were all  W|r#d.  It was around 11:30PM or so, when someone rang the doorbell. It was three more people, they had some [@nn@bi$; and we smoked about two or three j[]|NT$. Then another friend called my cEll and said he was on his way with 4 or 5 other people, I was like cOOL.... So they came, then most of us decided to get some more y@Yo, and more beer.    b\_AH, b\_AH,  b\_AH,    eTc....   11:30 - 3:00A.M? *  Mostly everyone left by now, including my ride home but; I decided to stay because,  my friend was getting more y@Y. Then around 4:00 I was going to walk home (I live about 1 1/4 mi. away). So my friend came with back to my house, we brought a twelve pack of beer with too. So we were at my house by 4:30.   5:00AM - 7:00AM *   The sun was shining bright through  my  livingroom window , it was about 30 degrees outside. And my friend asked me If I  wanted to take a walk to get an   "EiG#t b@\_\_"   of Y@Yo, So I said; yeah fuck it lets go. It was about a  1/4 mile walk from my house. So we go there, he knocked on the door, and I felt so fucking tense at this time because, we were there so early in the morning on a Saturday. The person answers, and invites us in. My friend told them the business and they said O.K. We get what we wanted and left, we got back to my house and, continued the party at 7:45AM!   8:00AM - 11:30AM * Sitting around my house FUCKED up! Listening to some music. It was around 11:45AM A friend called and said he had some [@nn@bi$ for sale, and to stop on by. Around this time I was up for nearly 24 hours with no sleep. So we went over there around 12 Noon and  $M[]KED a b\_unT outside, it was around 50 degrees. We stayed until 2:30PM or so. And walked around the neighborhood, when my friend saw his crazy cousin, standing oustside in front of his house. So we went over there to talk to him, and see what was going on. He asked us if we wanted to come inside and drink. We said sure, and we went in and smoked some more [@nn@bi$. And of course, drink more beer. We stayed there until 5 'O clock and, we went back to my other friend's house; where we were earlier.    5:00PM - 9:45PM *  We were still by my friend's and, again we got some more Y@YO. We were listening to some DEicidE, DEAth, then he put on some punk, DEAd KEnnEdY's, the RamonEs, and SpArE ChAngE, a local ChicAgo punk rock band. It was around 9:45PM  I was soooo tired. I went home, but my friend stayed. I went home to eat something and take a shower, I needed it. Then went to bed around 11:45PM. Ending the whole thing.

        I just hate Sunday's, they are sooo boring. I didn't do anything last night. I was listening to some music and, a spark of inspiration hit me. I just so happened to have a pen handy, I think it was something from an experience long time ago. Yeah, a  "blast from the past"  Although I don't this it is quite finished yet, I wanted to put it here anyway. March 21, 2004 1:05 AM.    Alone.... I'm talking about freedom, freedom to do whatever I want to do. I'm talking about the altered states of my mind, to see what is everything and beyond, even in between. And  everything that was ever seen, became reality as in a dream....     Whenever I get more idea's for it I will finish it, and put it here. I have really nothing going on today, I've been trying to score some  bud    since Friday, but this fucking neighborhood is so dry. Hopefully I'll get some this week. I hope so, I really need it.     ~mEF~

        Yeah I know, I haven't wrote here in a while.... I haven't forgot about it, I don't have any time these days. Well, here I am. Another reason is, I don't want this page to become a place for my daily life, I'm sure some people do just that. But, I would rather write about my  ExperiEncE's  or I can just write about  "certain"  event's.  Sign the guestbook at: http://guestbook.de/gb.cgi?gid=765989&prot=bzdxpe ~mEf

          I have some terrible news, on April 14, 2004 my computer crashed on me. Only later did I find out that my C.D. ROM drive broke. Good news is that I was able to recover my memory, all of my MP3 files among other stuff are still OK. What had happened, I was trying to "RESTORE" my computer because it had some serious problems, and the C.D. just went blank. So after a week went by and countless times trying to get this bootdisk to work, I  found out it was my [E:] drive.  :( Right now I am on my friend's computer typing this, until I get the CPU. Fixed I'll probably cancel my DSL connection. :p Well, I will try to get to my friend's house from time 2 time to access a computer. Until then I will try to stay StOnEd! :) pEAcE oUt!         ~mEfStEr =SEA=
