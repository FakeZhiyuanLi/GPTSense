       Man, I swear I'm starting to forget what going to school feels like.   Sick   again  today! This is just getting annoying now. One of my nostrils doesn't work, but at least the runny nose stopped. I'm coughing now though. This must be a new phase of the disease, because I wasn't coughing before. Well anyway, the other day I lied. "This Love" by Maroon 5 is good, but it's no longer the bestest song ever. This is it:  Deep inside your soul there's a hole you don't wanna see Every single day what you say makes no sense to me Even though I try I can't get my head around you  Somewhere in the night there's a light in front of me Heaven up above with a shove, I beg it's me Even though I try I fall in the river of you You've managed to bring me down too  All you're faking (Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up) Shows you're aching (Get Up, Get Up, Get Up)  Every single day what you say makes no sense to me Lettin' you inside, isn't right, don't mess with me I never really know what's really going on inside you I can't get my head around you  All you're feeling (Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up) Shows you're breathing (Get Up, Get Up, Get Up)  Deep inside your soul there's a hole you don't wanna see Covering it up like a cut with the likes of me  You know I've really tried, I can't do anymore about you  The cut's getting deeper (Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh) The hill's getting steeper (Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh)  I guess I'll never know what's really going on inside you I can't get my head around you I can't get my head around you I can't get my head around you I can't get my head around you -"(Can't Get My) Head Around You," Offspring

                              Man, this being sick thing is getting old.   I'm sick again today and for some reason my ears feel all water-logged. You know when you're listening to your music on headphones and you try to tell someone something, and you don't realize that you're yelling because the music is so loud? It feels like that all day for me. But anyway, I was watching MTV and people, this is officially the bestest song ever:  I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in her eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I tried my best to feed her appetite Keep her coming every night So hard to keep her satisfied Kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave again  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright My pressure on your hips Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of you Cause I know that's what you want me to do -"This Love," Maroon 5

                  I'm sick. In more ways than one.   I'm home sick today. I've got that coughey-sinusey-headachey-dizzy-sore-throughtey-slight-feverey-virus. Yeah, I'm feeling really phlegmy. I've used enough tissues already to absorb Crater Lake. But hey, on a lighter note, the Oscars were yesterday. Lord of the Rings finally got props for the Trilogy, which is good, because up until now the academy's been giving them the cold shoulder. I just saw the movie Matchstick Men on DVD. Oh my God that is the worst movie ever. It totally sabatoges itself with the ending. I get that he's a con man and in the end he gets conned, but did they have to con him so fricken hard? He's Obsessive Compulsive for heaven sakes! And the epilogue! That was was the worst thing I have ever seen. It says  ONE YEAR LATER  but the girl looks like she's friggen 19! If you've never seen the movie you can't realate to my anger, but if you have seen it then more than likely you feel the same way I do. I'm going to Panera Bread for lunch. They have good sandwiches there. And good soup. Maybe that'll make me feel better. I'm going to buy School of Rock on DVD tomorrow. I guess I'll watch it on the family DVD Player because mine's busted. I guess that's what happens when you buy a DVD Player from Winn Dixie. It was only 40 bucks though, how could I lose? This is probably my fourth Blog in the past year. I keep forgetting my user name's and password's. Maybe I should write it down somewhere...

                           Double-Swallowed Chicken and Random Questions     Have you ever thrown up and then swallowed it back again? I did that today. It was chicken. How come when you swallow something it tastes good, (usually) but when you taste it again it tastes nasty? Have I been deprived if I've never eaten Fruity Pebbles? People Tell me they're good. Aren't Fruity Pebbles made of rice? Isn't vodka made of rice? Didn't the Russians make up vodka? If Chinese people eat rice everyday (most likely) then why didn't Chinese people make up Vodka? Do Russians even eat rice? Did you know that marshmallows are 80% air? It's like people are paying for air! We should sart an uprising for this cannot be tolerated! The marshmallow people should downsize their marshmallow prices by 80%. Well I'm getting bored and I'm running out of stupid, random things to say, so I'll just save you the pain of reading any further. See ya my peeps!

       If you like pina coladas, getting caught in the rain, duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh   Somebody spilled smoothie all down the aisle of the bus on the way back from Montgomery. It got all up on my shoe. The trip was somewhat fun, though. Me and Dillon must have gotten those trucks to honk their horns like 20 times. Did we ever find out who knocked down that picture in the Rosa Parks Museum? It wasn't me, that's all I know. Oh my God, that woman in the Judicial Building said keplar, but it's kevlar. She even spelled it out: K-E-P-L-A-R. Woo, some people are just...argh. The mall was fun. Did you know that they have Skittles in Limited Too? That guy in Hot Topic looked like Michael with a mowhawk, I swear. When we got back, and played outside it was fun. I rolled. I got dirty. I was having fun. Then, something happened. I got a Math study guide. Ouch.

                                   No, I'm not dead.   Sorry, I didn't have time to post for awhile. I went back to school though. Surprisingly  some   people were glad to see me. That was new. Maybe I should be sick more often... Anyway, school was boring. I wish Mr. Sipes, the Science teacher, would wear his Indiana warm-up suit again. Then we could laugh at him. Well,  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  is the best browser ever, is better than IE, and is faster too. Cool.

       Wow.   I have just witnessed the nastiest thing I've ever seen before. At A-Day there was this old lady sitting in front of me. All of a sudden she took off her shoes and started clipping her toenails. I swear, I almost threw up. She kept picking at, and caressing her old, wrinkly feet. She didn't stop the whole time. She just kept going and going-like the Energizer Bunny. Other than that though, it was a pretty good game. *Shiver* Bad Imagery...

No matter who you are, you know me. I'm that guy in the back of the room always going, "Huh?" Yeah you know me. I store candy in my trumpet case. Yeah you know me, I tripped and fell into the trash can. You know me, I'm the only guy in class who's ever forgotten to wear underwear. You know me.

       I can't think of anything good to put in this little space...   So we got report cards today...OH YEAH, I GOT ALL A'S, DUH-NUH-NUH-NUH-NUH-NUH. I need like my own theme song. I could just freestyle a tune while I walk maybe. OK, I've decided to fill out a list of things about me:   How I would like to die : TIE: Suffocating in Jello, or Drowning in chocolate syrup.  The best feeling in the world : TIE: When you get whipped cream on your face, or when you have to pee for a really long time, and then you finally do pee.  I feel cool the most when : I'm sliding across the kitchen floor in my socks.  Favorite Website :  urlLink Tech TV   Most Habitual Activity : TIE: Chewing a straw, or humming  Favorite color : Gray  Most Said Phrase : "Huh?"  Music : Love it, thanks KaZaA.  Isn't that illeagal? : Love it, thanks KaZaA.  Aspirations : Sleeping, eating, dying.

                                                         1. Shpants (Noun): a. Pants that usually extend beyond the knee, but no farther than the shin. b. Often considered as a mix between Shorts and pants   I just love shpants. They are so awesome. They make me feel good and comfortable.  urlLink Shpants.Net  has many good examples of shpant-wearers and testimonials from people who love shpants as much as I do. The other day I was walking in my shpants and it hit me: Shpants are the most comfortable things ever. Yes, as I write this I am wearing shpants. I love them. I love them like a brother...wait, I already have a brother...

My grandfather bought a 5-pack of 'em, but got sick after eating one, so he gave them to us. I thought, it couldn't be too bad...I was wrong. I ate that bagel and BOOM, I was sick all day. Not cool Mr. Evil Bagel, not cool at all.

       Holy Crap, we really are rednecks.   I saw this story and, being an Alabamian, just couldn't let it go:   In a move that will surely improve the southern state's image, Alabama's Senate has named Conecuh Ridge Fine Alabama Whiskey the official state spirit. Conecuh Ridge Fine Alabama Whiskey traces its roots back to an illegal moonshine made in the woods near southeast Montgomery and now joins the largemouth bass, the pecan, and the yellowhammer in the pantheon known as State Symbols of Alabama.   The resolution to make the whiskey the state spirit was vetoed twice by the governor and both times was overridden by the state Senate, thus making it official. A spokesperson for the governor's office was quoted as saying "The Legislature should have more important things to do," and went on to say that taking time to override the governor's veto made no sense given the economic problems that the state faces. State Sen. Pat Lindsey responded by saying "I thought the resolution was harmless and humorous." The governor vetoed the measure because he felt that official designations were meant for historic, natural, or native items and not for commercial products.   This kind of thing really makes me want to hurt people. Have we really sunk this low, that we have glorified a descendent of an illegal drink originally created in the back woods of some drunk guy's shack? I guess we have. What's the use of fighting it. In the end it's gonna overwhelm us, and we won't be able to do anything about it. I'm very depressed now. Very depressed indeed.

       Ouch = Self-Enlightenment   Today Megan accidentally slammed her locker door into my head. It hurt for the time being, it hurt. But, after awhile, I realized: It could have been much worse. I could have been hit in the crotch or knocked unconsious. I realize now that I should live life to the fullest, because any day I could be knocked into a coma, get a legged chopped off, or get shot in the stomach. I'll now try to be kinder to people. Give more than I'm already giving. Yep, that door slam has made me a better person. Yeah, it hurt like crap, but I thank Megan for it. Thank you Megan.

       If gum was a drug, I'd be in rehab.   By the way, the whole " z being cool" thing is now over. Well, for spring break, I went to Disneyworld, and the whole time I couldn't buy gum. Ouch. That hurts Disneyworld, that hurts. The rest of the trip was pretty cool, though. My feet hurted a lot during it, but that's okay...

       Bored...A feeling I am now used to.   The other day I stepped on a shard of glass. It was painful, but it didn't really start flaring up till now. I got a digital camera for my birthday though. That makes me feel a little better. I'm still bored though... I cant really walk all that much...yeah...But anyway, I should probably do something...that doesn't involve walking. I'm feeling a little melancholic. Betcha didn't know I knew that word. But still, I'm a little depressed...Maybe nothing is better than school...Or maybe not...

         Before today, i could never tell u who i just cant stand at certain moments. with normal ppl i could get mad at them for maybe 5 minutes, with shmitty it just seems to drag out! he is the only person i can truly say i love/hate. but at this moment i hate!! i hate him more than i hate hitler, ok maybe not that much but pretty bad! he's just upset cuz he's girl dumped him! so shmitty all i have to say is "burn in hell bastard!" felicia out.

       I knew I wasn't just entertaining myself.   Finally all my hard blogging has paid off. I got a G-Mail Account! Peeps, that's a gigabyte of mail storage. Way more than any other mail client you'll find out there. So the moral of this story is: Blog hard, and you will be rewarded. Oh yeah, and my partner McKlevlin didn't get it. Just me. HAHA!

       HAHA! I didn't brush my teeth today!   It's true. I was in a hurry this morning and boo-yah! no one told me to so hey, that's almost like telling me not to, right? Yep. Got the Franz Ferdinand CD yesterday. It's really awesome. By the way, I went to AU Summer Band Camp last week. It was pretty cool. Me and Michael made a huge straw out of 30 inter-connected straws. I would've got a picture of it, but I didn't bring my camera,(Mom: "Don't bring it, it could get stolen")and the huge straw was hardly portable, so we just tore it apart and threw it away. Pity...

       Know what annoys me?   PEOPLE THAT CLAP WHEN THEY LAUGH! GOD! I was at the movie theater seeing The Terminal,which was good except for this lady in the front who kept clapping when she laughed. The half of the dialogue that I could hear over the earthshaking clapfest was good though. Sheesh. Shmitty out.

      Boredom + Awesome CD = Jubilation  I got a new CD today:    Two words: Freaking Awesome.  Especially on Time is Running Out, Sing for Absolution, and Stokholm Syndrome. Probably the best album I've ever bought. Vocals = Amazing. My new favorite band. $14.03 well spent. Shmitty out.

      Kinda of bored so i decided to make a list of stuff i like and dislike:        WHY I LIKE USHER! 1) he is beyond sexy, it's just every part of him is just.....WO! 2) he's a gentlemen, respects women, doesnt seem to be thinkin bout their butts every 5 seconds *cough shmitty* 3)he knows how to dress! which also goes back to number 1 but lets not go their! 4)he is rich! see how it's not at the top, but it's still a good reason.         WHY I CANT STAND SHMITTY SOMETIMES! 1) he gets so annoyin, it's....annoying! i gotta find more adjectives. 2) he is very vague about stuff sometimes, and it drives me crazy. y cant guys just get straight to the point. 3) he makes me laugh when im mad at him! cant stand that either! 4) he wants useless things! like a guitar, like he would be able to play it! he can hardly play the trumpet and he takes lessons! jk! he's really good at trumpet. but not as good as matt!         WHY I CANT STAND MCKLEVLIN SOMETIMES! *basicly it's everythin for shmitty cuz there kinda like one person except there 2 people. but i do have reasons y i like them.  1-4) they talk to me when im bored! haha jk!     cutey out!

       Announcement.     &nbsp;  Ms. Felicia Carpe Retundre III has been relieved of her duties, upon review of her participation.&nbsp;I have recently&nbsp;discovered that she has done 12.7% of the posts. Not only that, most of them were saying ugly things about me. This cannot be tolerated. As such she will not be participating at this blog anymore. Good riddance.

       Good...     &nbsp;  That could be classified as an actual thought. Good job girl!   Blogger changed the Post interface so the font and stuff might change, but oh well...  I've just been at the lake for the weekend. I'm sunburnt and everything feels like it's floating, but overall, it was a cool experience.   I burnt my little brother a CD to blow the Jackson 5&nbsp;right out of him. It is as follows:   1.) Anthem of Our Dying Day - Story&nbsp;of the Year (He'd already heard this one and liked it&nbsp;so I put it in.)&nbsp;  2.) Memory - Sugarcult  3.) Our Time is Running Out - Muse  4.) Are You Gonna Be My Girl (Once again, one he heard and liked.)  5.) Lithium - Nirvana  6.) Somebody Told Me - The Killers  7.) Alive - Ima Robot  8.) Ch-Check It Out - Beastie Boys  9.) Walkie Talkie Man&nbsp;- Steriogram  10.) Walk Idiot Walk - The Hives  11.) Hate to Say I Told You So - The Hives  12.) Meant To Live - Switchfoot (Once again, one he had&nbsp;heard and liked.  13.) Ride - The Vines  14.) Stockholm Syndrome - Muse  Hopefully, Now he won't go to meet Michael Jackson and get molested. Hopefully.

       Could someone play Taps in the background please?     A small time ago, one of our own, Felicia Carpe Retundre III, was discharged from service. Angry, she decided to form her own blog with Amelia, in protest of us Spazzes. And, as I predicted, it failed. So, today, we look upon it's memorial, with tears of sorrow:     Just Kidding. Shmitty Out.

       Ender's Game Movie...Another Excuse to eat Popcorn!   I'm really excited about a movie that's going to be coming out, an adaptation of probably my favorite book ever written,  urlLink Ender's Game . It was announced on both  urlLink Ain't It Cool News  and  urlLink Fresco Pictures . Not much information has been announced, but I'll be eagerly awaiting!
