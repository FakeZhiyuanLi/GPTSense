      I read parts from Douglas Adams' books fairly regularly even though I have read most of his books several times over. I frequently come across stuff that I somehow did not pay adequate attention to. Today, I came across this:  Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, then everything else in life becomes eerily easy.  - Douglas Adams (Mostly Harmless)  I think I missed this one because it had an SEP field around it ;-)

      Guess you must have heard about Chetan Bhagat's book 'Five Point Someone'. The book is the story of IIT from the insider's perspective. Chetan is IIT Delhi and IIM A passout. The book was launched in Bangalore over the weekend. Do check out  urlLink a review .   Disclaimer: I don't have any vested interest in the book and I haven't read it myself. However, I have heard rave reviews from friends, so thought of recommending it to you guys, before I go and pick up a copy for myself.

      Rated: R ( For use of strong language.)  Don’t read any further in this post if you are a goody-good kitsch asshole. I have posted many others for people like you but this one goes out as homage to  urlLink Holden Caulfield .  If you are reading this then you probably know what a blog is and in all likelihood you'll have one of your own. You often wonder that why your blog isn't as popular as some of the other pretentious bastards on the net who have got nothing else to do but brag about their stupid mundane life or voice their opinions about things that they can do nothing about. Then why do you do it? The simplest reason for this is the fact that as humans you are craving for attention and have a belief that you are the centre of the universe. You give too much importance to yourselves. You are part of a generation that has been raised by television commercials to run after things which do not make much sense but are a status symbol in the society. The whole fuss about a 1 GB GMAIL account all over the tech savvy community proves it.  I know that you are lying if you say you never wished for a GMAIL account. In all probability you would have mailed your friends for it, contacted complete strangers requesting for it, posted petitions on various blogs, yahoo groups and orkut communities. Just look inside and try to answer to yourself,   "Why do I need a 1 GB email account? "  I doubt that the most common answer will be something other than  status symbol .  Why is it that you can’t accept the harsh realities of life? Why is it that you are always looking for other people to approve your actions? Why do you  give a fuck  to what other people say about you?  I reread this post and changed all the  WE s and  I s to  YOU s so that it makes a better impact. I am also a part of the same ostentatious world you live in and think like you do. And if there are some people who are still looking for GMAIL invites, mail me your full name and email address, I have got 5 left.   urlLink My Blog

If anyone still needs them, mail me your full name and email address at ravihanda@gmail.com. yahoo is creating some trouble with Gmail invites by sending them in BulkMail folder or treating them as Spam so i request you to give a non-yahoo email address.

      the little red devils come marching upon me to take my body and claim my soul they know no limits, know no boundary they just march in to eat me whole  they march right in when i am sleeping they have no god apart from need from every crevice they come out creeping feeding on death, their only creed  they're everywhere the eye can see inside my room, upon my bed they crawl on my skin full of glee they even crawl inside my head  i cannot run, i cannot hide cornered thus, i have to fight they hurt me hard,they wound my pride crushing my soul with all their might  they have their fill,they take the spoils they leave me hurt, in deepest sorrow i make a resolve, my anger boils i'll kill those goddamned ants tomorrow!!!   this poem was inspired by an attack of red ants in my room(which hasn't been cleaned for ages and is fertile ground for wildlife activity!!!) which left me red-patched and itchy all over...

       urlLink Al Pacino  once said in an interview, “You are as good as your last movie.” and I think the same concept can be applied to blogs too. If I create the profile of an average visitor to this blog it would be a 20-25 year old male, probably IITian, who never really had an actual opportunity to be in love. The question that I want to raise now is  “Is there hope?”  Frankly speaking, I don’t think so.    Love  , in my opinion, requires a certain amount of stupidity to become a real success. As the time passes by we become mature and finally reach an age when we judge everything rationally. The loss of   rational   is an extremely necessary prerequisite for love. Considering my personal case, which I presume is of majority of the readers, I was busy with studies in my high school years and I never looked so good that females would drop as I passed by. I had neither the time nor the inclination for the incidental fling in those years and never had the opportunity once I was out of high school. Spending four or five years in a college where the boy : girl ratio is 20 : 1, its human to give up on love. But, I don’t think that even after I pass out from here, I will have the chance to look for my soul mate. I know that I am not  urlLink Richard Bach  who could abandon everything and leave in search for true love. This happens only in books like  urlLink “The Bridge Across Forever”  or some Yash Chopra movie. Two years from now, most probably, I would be doing a 9 in the morning to 10 in the night job at a software firm which would not leave me any time other than weekends. Finding a girl in that time would be extremely hard as, lets face it, I would be out partying with my guy friends.   I remember Tim Robbins in  urlLink The Shawshank Redemption  when he said, “Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” Well, Mr. Robbins mine is taking its few last breaths.

      I just found a site called  urlLink  GMail Swap  . Their tagline says  Because people are nice .  And there was another one that talked about a chain of free GMail invites. Their tagline was  Pay It Forward .  Now,  Pay It Forward  is one of my favourite movies. So, I've decided to be nice and give away the 3 Gmail invites I have for free. The only condition being that you do the same when you get those free invites.  Of course, I have no way of ensuring that you will actually send those invites for free, but I will trust you.  Because people are nice.  Leave a comment here with your e-mail address and name. The first 3 will get the invites. And more when I get more invites to send out.  [ Edited on June 21 ]  I have got more invites now. Send in your request as a comment on this post with  Full Name  and  e-mail id .

      Considering that this blog has been mostly dormant, apart from serving as a list of links to some great blogs of course (which in itself is no mean deed), I thought of starting a discussion (hoping to start at least). I posted this at my blog a couple of days back, and had a decent enough response. Let's see how you guys react.  --------------------------------   I came across  urlLink this  article by Tavleen Singh via  urlLink Wonderbug's blog .  Moreover,  urlLink her last post  also got me thinking, or rather thinking again, on this topic. I left a long comment too at her post. Funny how some issues never get redundant!   Now I am not a very devout Hindu by any long shot. I never go to temples, attend  poojas  once in a while only because my parents stress on it (which they rarely ever do). In fact, I have often thought of converting to some other religion, most likely Islam, just to see if it makes the slightest bit of difference to me. But that doesn't mean that I am not aware of my history and heritage. I know more about my religion, and my caste than most people I have come across. I also take avid interest in reading up on the history and evolution of other religions. And all this has taught me one thing - many of us give a hell of a lot of importance to something as personal as one's religion and beliefs, more than what is sanely necessary. This is what politicians, most of them at least, make full use of.   I am not apologetic about being a Hindu. Just as I am not apologetic about being an Indian, Bihari, 22-year old, male, human being. I was born into it, and it is what I make of it, not what some ignorant western journalist projects it to be. That is why, it really offends me to my core when I hear the word 'Hindu' being mentioned in the media as something with orthodox, millitant, intolerant, despicable connotations. And that happens quite a lot to have missed your senses. I really don't care much about what BBC or CNN thinks of Hindus, which translates to a majority of Indians, apart from the fact that these are also inadvertently shaping the average foreigner's opinion about me. This is not very different form the picture that Hollywood portrayed of India as a land of loin-cloth clad, snake-charming, elephant-riding, mantras-chanting, black magic-practising, Kali-worshipping, idiots, for a very long time. But, what takes my goose is that even our own politicians are misusing 'secular' to mean 'anti-Hindu'.  BJP's been branded a Hindu nationalist party for eternity. There are people, and a substantial number at that, who might be dangerous to the idea of 'secularism', but there are saner people too, who just happen to be simply proud of being Hindus. It will be very naive on our part if we just get blinded by the media hype, and utterances by 'secular' parties' leaders, to believe that every single BJP worker is sharpening his knife to stab the next innocent minority community member that passes by. Come on, let's use our brains too, for once. Respect for another person is not possible in the true sense if you don't respect your own self. Similarly, you can't really respect another man's religion unless you respect your own religion too.  Actually, there are too many aspects to this and with all the thoughts erupting in my mind, I am afraid I might lose coherence. Any person with a basic sense of logic, an average memory, and some knowledge of our recent history can judge that no party today in our polity is really secular. There are some persons in every party who are, others who aren't. And so, judging an entire political party that is made up of so many brilliant individuals with their own individual traits and personalities as non-secular and fundamentalist smacks of ignorance. I could go on and on talking about the 'secular' credentials of other parties, but I am sure we are all knowledgable people here, and are already aware. The point is that public memory, as they say, is very short and very soon Gujarat riots would be forgotten. Just as Delhi re-elected Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler. Political parties, and the public, don't really care about how many people died in the riots, or who perpetrated them. Right now Gujarat is being cited by BJP baiters because it's fresh in our memory, fresh enough to extract political gains.  So to sum up there are two points that I want people to consider seriously. One, don't judge any party on the basis of whether it is secular or not, as none truly is. Two, and more importantly, don't get influenced by the media, and start believing that every thing Hindu is bad. Most of it is not. As with any religion. And that is my interpretation of Hindutva.

      Have you ever been to Dalhousie? I plan to go there over the coming weekend. If you have been there and can give me some fundaes (we can never give up IIT lingo, can we?).. that would be great!  What are the places around that one can see? I've checked a few things on the net, but a first-hand idea would probably be better.  Anyone in Delhi willing to take a break and visit Dalhousie?

      These IIT blogs are good fun. I am slowly getting pretty addicted to reading them on a regular basis. It gives me enthu to blog as well. Though, I am guessing, I am a little over the hill for blogging (seems like the average age of the blogger is below 25).  Also, seems like the Tag board/Doodle board is a permanent fixture on most blogs. Am wondering if anyone knows the approx % of current students in IIT who blog? Are they from a specific insti, dept, hostel etc. Or is the phenomena widespread?   Also all you bloggers beware. NY Times is calling it a  urlLink serious addiction  :)  On another note, We have a feature which provides a script that allows bloggers to recommend favorites.  You can check it out here:   urlLink AiYo favorites   Sorry for the shameless self-promotional plug... But thought that it was relevant to blogging and may even be fun for ppl.

      I was always branded as a pseudo-hostelite. Truth is, I went home only to watch TV, play on the comp, and more importantly: do the laundry. What that little two days spent at home afforded in terms of reducing home-sickness is just trivial. I hardly ever got homesick during the 4 year period, inspite of once staying a month in the hostel during a difficult period of end-sem exams. Thus, while I may not get classified as a true "Hostelite" as I had only stayed on an average 5 days a week in the hostel, it did give me a good perspective on what hostel-life is all about.  My original hostel had been, as mentioned before: Mandakini. But as the leaf turned over, it so happened that not enough seniors left in order to accomodate all the incoming juniors. So some had to invariably shift. That some included me. I was transferred, or rather, asked to be transferred to Alakananda Hostel, where there was a larger proportion of Chennai-ities and a larger proportion of branch-mates in my batch. Was it a change for the better. I suppose it was.   I still remember:   The long nite-outs, spent many times farting (meaningless gossiping, NOT creating an atmosphere of noxius air and pungent smells), discussing events, rumors, anecdotes, stories, news, books, academics, silly profs and their sillier actions and their silliest method of teaching courses; spent sometimes studying for exams; spent many times gaming; and finally spent doing nothing but watching movies.    The sometimes early morning rides I undertook with friends to the nearby Beasant Nagar beach to enjoy the morning sun, and sometimes a cool walk.   The afternoons spent crashing heavily, until someone with some sense decided to wake us up so that he could have company to go the mess for tea.   The evenings sometimes spent playing games, sometimes swimming, sometimes reading books (some new book always found the way into the wingmates - new books ready to be read, reviewed, criticised and then shamelessly passed on).   The messing around in the mess, noon and nites, eating food aka  grub  (though it could hardly be classified as one) with a heavy heart, discussing abject subjects with an even abject interest. Fussy Lucky ones managed to stay out of the circle of hostel messes completely, feeding solely on the snack crumbs at the nearby bakery in the evenings and a regular "Garden restaurant" in the nite and once again, in the late-nite. The availability of ice-creams in the messes and the opening of a Dhaba really spiced up the last year of hostel-stay.  That was completely offset by the innumerable treats that were given (and shamelessly taken too) in multifarious restaurants around the city. Popular ones being the Sangeetha and Shakes & Creams in Adyar, Residency, Dhaba Express in Beasant Nagar to name a few.  I also contributed by bringing grub from my house which relatives pretentiously left at my place thinking that I lived in a out-of-civilisation tribal area. Grub that included tasty namkeens, washed out chips, cakes, pastries, and some traditional sweets. I just assumed that it was in their best interests. But that did help me in me becoming more popular among the guys because I got good food to offset the measly hostel grub.   The Eating Out that sometimes formed a part of End-Sem completion celebrations, mostly observed by dipping bodily into the waters of the Bay of Bengal, frolicking in the sand and consummated finally by cosuming food at nearby restaurants.   While all this seemed rosy, there were quite a few disadvantages of staying in hostels, especially at IIT Madras; a scenario quite not possible in other IIT's. Problem: Lack of water. The lack of water which coerced hostel management to get water supply through tankers, which effected the release of water daily to be limited to a period of 2 hours: one in the morning and one in the evening, forcing the billigerant hostelites to catch water every nite so that water would be available in the morning to atleast brush teeth and "Do the Loo", and if possible, take bath, or better yet, stay bath-free for a week. THANK GOD for Deoderants. This total water scarcity which had forced compression of more than two semesters (from 5 day week to 6 day week so that the sem would close 3 weeks earlier) also caused the non-washing of the BOGS (Bathroom Of Graduate Students, as we always called 'em) resulting in toilets so dirty for weeks that we would have gladly used the public corporation toilets.   Another "Unique" problem to IIT hostels: Monkeys. Actually: the common  langur . Initial observation brands them as:  " Oh, Look at it. Its so cute nibbling on that leaf." "Wow. Look there. Its so cuddly." "Hey. There is one grooming the other. Can there be anything sweeter?".  Bull s**t. One week of stay in the hostel is enough to change anybody to gun-toting, shotgun riding, ready-to-shoot-any-monkey mood. One week. Thats all it takes.  My first experience with them: First year. I brought a huge load of home-made namkeens and a cake from house. While going to the afternoon session of class, the window was left open by mistake. Come evening. I open the door the a nite-mare. Namkeen spilt and spread all over the floor. Mineral-water-in-a-can tipped over, gurgling slowly, wetting and softening everything. And to complete the party celeberations, columns of red ants that decided to do the cleaning work.  Ended up spending the whole evening cleaning the mess. Come every afternoon, there is a monkey raid. Apart from tipping over garbage bins and making the corridors dirty, they surreptitiously enter the rooms, make everything dirty, untidy, and untouchable and sometimes entertain us by "making babies". Thw worst part was, just after the BOGS are cleaned, they come over, spoil and soil everything, leave the taps running (wasting the little water that was available for bathing) and sometimes scare innocent hostelmates doing their loo. Argh. I still hate em. All this apart, life in hostel was fun, inspite of not having even LAN among the rooms. I must say that the magic of staying in hostels completely took me by surprise. A feeling that shud, rather, ought to be enjoyed by anybody who joins this institution.

      I admit. Academics in college IS different from that of a school. But what I didnt expect when I took that leap from school to college is the total stark change in the method of teaching, the system of academics and the intricacies of college education.   First Day. Monday morning (Why does it always have to be a Mon Day?) Me. Cycling furiously in sweltering weather towards the distant classes. (On retrospection, the distance seems to have reduced as the years passed by.) Reaching the Class Room Complex. Confused as to where to go. Asking equally, if not more, confused students where to go. (Remember the dis-orienting orientation?) First class: Material Sciences. 100 (equally?-)brite students jotting down seriously and sincerely the syllabus, books, prof's names, email id's and room no's followed by the heaving at the overwhelming enormousness of the entire thing, the quizzes, the mid-term exams, the end-sems, the assignments.   Days passed. Courses passed. Snickering remarks behind the back of bad profs, didnt-know-what-they-were-teaching profs, pedantic profs, passed. Exams passed. Assignments successfully passed. End semesters successfully passed.  Waiting anxiously for grades, passed. And then the whole routine, again. Over and over again. 7 more times. The only thing changing: more courses, more tougher courses, more assignments, more difficult exams; and the added project work in the last sem.   Typical first year problems faced by me and everybody, fazed me and everybody. A course called ID110, Engineering Design Principles, which involved the brains to sow their engineering skills into practical problems: like measuring the length of a 2km long road, without surveying instruments; like measuring the height of a water tower, using trignometry: like developing a cantilever out of broomstik and have the maximum weight held/cantilever weight, (Mine came third at 500gm/8gm) did kindle the interest of all students. An interest which was never rekindled afterwards. A course called Engineering drawing. Memories revived everyday by seeing juniors hurrying to classes in their huge drafters, and the even larger chart boxes. It was quite a fun course. 3 hour long sessions of drawing, followed by even more furious rubbing, moving scales around, asking the girls innocently as to what to do next, inspite of having finished it already. The AutoCAD sessions really spiced my day. They made the job of Engineering drawing much more easier. (The S grades I had got in both the Drawing courses did help buoy my spirits).   The dreaded workshop. Especially the fitting workshop. 3 hour workshop Heads made us 3 (sometimes 4) hour drones, shafing the file mindlessly over a stupid iron piece which wouldnt care less if it werent filed and then, miraculously increased in size. The files, with equally ridiculous names, only job was to file away our hands, leaving way to blisters and torn skin to take over the pain that resided for the next week.   For the not so lucky: NCC. A dreaded 3 letter 4 hour gruelling session, that dragged us every weekend day early in the morning, for 20 days a year. Wasting most of the energy saved from eating the thimble sized morsels at the hostel mess into stomping the ground in torn, but yet, still hard boots under a hot sweltering sun; the only consolation being a small creamless cake and a hot puff, which, most of the time went to the mouth of a more hungry dog that promptly and punctiliously came to every NCC session. The 20 day "compulsory" "camp" conducted in one of the hostels was perhaps the last straw.   Somehow, the last 4 years have passed by. 'N' nerve-wracking nite-outs doing assignments, mugging for exams, doing project work. I persevered. I didnt give up, unlike the exceptionally some who did. I survived.  Academically, I was, perhaps, successful. I can't say otherwise. So many other things I had wanted to do, yet couldnt...   Next Post: Hostel Life.  To be continued...

      This is a first of a series of posts: posts which are a conglameration of memories of my college-years, which just got terminated recently. Memories, triggered by the Invitation to my Convocation, signifying the end of all ties with my college, and the recent counselling sessions, the beginnning of any student's entry into IIT.  Besides, these are memories that should be closely treasured by, before they all  Just. Wither. Away. So incoming, a collexion of the recollexion of memories, anecdotes, interesting bits and memorabilia, that just go to make up my college life.    Down the Memory Lane, Part I    I still remember the very first trip I had made into IIT, just to see the rank I had got. Even though it was posted at the entrance, and even though I did not go more than 10 meters into the campus, it just got me a whole lot closer to the dream I had had since my 10th.   I still remember the counselling sessions (mine was on the first day itself) , where we had to choose the branch and the IIT where we had to go. The last minute decision (it was, infact, exactly the last minute) to bump up Mechanical @  IIT Madras  over Electrical @  IIT Kharagpur  made me what I am today. The thought that  my blog  mite not even have existed does put a bit of fear. I am happy now that things have headed in a good direction.   I still remember the orientation function afterwards. In my mind, as in everybody else's, it was as dis-orienting as possible. The seniors (including girls, or non-males, as everybody refers to) giggling from the floors above, sneering at the next victims that they could pounce upon as soon as we entered the hostels did not present a pleasant site.   I still remember the day I moved into the hostel - Mandakini, to be exact, on the eve of the day before the classes started. We were bunched up, three in a room (designed for two). It was often said by returning alumni, that the one thing they would remember after leaving IIT, is their hostel room numbers, which almost becomes engraved in one's mind. I cannot just put it in any other better way. Mine was 368 A, the 'A' signifying that I was the first in that room; the other two being a Northie guy in Electrical, and then luckily, a Tam guy in Metallurgical, who had come to the same JEE coaching classes with me. Consolation for me.  Sudhon  was in the same hostel, 4 rooms from mine.   I still remember the first time I got ragged. A group of quite note-worthy seniors caught me just as my parents left me and then asked me to do some quite wierd stuff. I got through, and IT was quite a mental hell for me. Then on, the decision never to rag others stuck to my mind.   I still remember the first food that I had had at the mess. While, to some, it did cause allergic reactions, constipations, and some vomitting even, I could just manage it. Physically, I could not find anything wrong with it. Apart from the insects, beetles and spiders which occasionally find its way into the huge buckets of sambar, rasam, equally huge vessels competing for size for rice and curry and the dinner plates, or the water that would have made sea water taste like mineral water, there was nothing wrong with it. It was just plain boring, and not tasty either. But, it was just food. And a man needs to eat. I soon ended up competing for the lowest mess bill that month, by not eating any of the extra stuff provided with the basic food (like cool drinks for a hot afternoon, vegetable kurmas, egg curry, puffs and samosas to accompany tea, ice-creams during dinner...). One thing I am glad about is the fact that eating in the mess, immunises anyone against any food and water borne diseases in the future - that ocould come in quite handy.    To be continued...

      I was talking with a friend recently and these questions just popped up.   Is there something like a  Typical IITian ?  If there is, then who exactly is a  Typical IITian ?   What are the characterstics of such a person?   Let me clarify right in the beginning that JEE is  not  something that can be counted as a common  characterstic . On similar lines, living in IIT and such superficial things are out.  What I am really interested is, in finding out whether there is a concept of  Typical IITian , to which a large majority of IITians would confirm?  Personally, I find it hard to define such a thing because we IITians can be quite a difficult study.   On one hand, you have strong individualistic guys and on the other hand, there are the herd mentality guys. If that was not complicated enough, the very same people who tend to follow the herd in some aspects would turn out to be extremely individualistic in some other traits.  That was just an example. But its true for quite a lot of traits that one might be interested in looking for.  So ultimately, I find it hard to define a  Typical IITian . But a lot of people apply that description to a lot of IITians.  Throw some light people!

      I must confess, I always thought  Why 42? , every time I came across it in Douglas Adams's works. And even otherwise.  It gives me great pleasure to find that Douglas Adams had answered this question:   The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do' I typed it out. End of story.   Find the relevant post  urlLink  here  .  And take a chill pill now. Rest in peace. The answer is  42 .

      Going to college is a huge transition step for anybody. Including me. The entire cycle of meeting friends everyday, academics, hostel life, cultural and technical festivals are sure to come as a new experience for everybody.  What I am going to try to describe here is only a slice of that.  You have to be IN HERE to get the whole cake.   As first years, we were only headed by the (un)trusty seniors who asked us to go and cheer for the hostel in the Inter-hostel WM finals, or do some layman's job like cycling around for the clues in the Treasure Hunt or volunteer work for the Hostel Fete, etc. While all this seemed quite a bit boring (to say the list), it is what got many interested into the entire world different from what IIT's are associated with, academically. That interest did seep into me to, but after the first year, I couldn't sustain it for long. I was more inclined towards studies.  Sudhon  would be a better guide here. (Probably, I should ask him to write a bit here.   Of course, another aspect where IIT Madras was always famous for  Saarang  (Mardi Gras, for ol-timers), the biga-mega-giga culfest, and  Shaastra  - the tech fest. The first Saarang, I was unfortunate to miss (I was invited to attend the RD parade in New Delhi - at the same time). But the other three, I did put my head there. (U can read my review of the last one in the January Archives).  Saarang was always the grand conglameration of spicey events and high-voltage gigs and, of course, I admit it, a literal Baywatch. The mega quizzes which ran into the wee hours of the morning, the head-banging rock shows, the informal stalls designed to make everybody look like fools, and yet tempt them with prizes, the popular dramatics, choreo and the JAM sessions were all but Masalas in a tasty pickle. The Saarang '04 T-shirt sayings:   Bush around the beat. 	Leave no turn unstoned. 	Leaf over a new turn. 	Live a Saarang   But Saarang was much more than all of that. A quintessential thread of the  Spirit of Saarang  ran through it, which could only be realised, understood and digested, but never can be taken.   Shaastra, the tech fest, more famous for attracting geeks, and non-geeks into fellow geeks. Jus Kidding This techfest, now having recently got the ISO 9001 certificate (which means that all events started and ended on time - a stark contrast to Saarang), is but a conglobation of events tied up to represent a tech fest. I literally wanted my body in many parts so that I could attend the quizzes, the gaming arena, the lectures, the video-conferences, the workshops and many many other events. But I loved the gameodrome the best. For two Shaastras I had put nite-outs to play some of my fav-games on the LAN with eight other equally enthusiastic people. This truly unique event, I will miss a lot.   Apart from Saarang and Shaastra, we had events all year round; the points won by the teams being added to hostel points, so that, at the end of the year, it could be decided which was the best hostel. (In fact, that title was taken by my hostel after a very long time). While these were the more happier aspects of being in IITM, there are, still some placid aspects for the diffident. The innumerable runs to the Academic sections (which I still have to do), ganging up together to go to the outside world, the innumerable treats at swank hotels, the hostel nites everybody's life was turned inside out and where final farewells were given and innumerable events, episodes and debacles that go to form part of the everyday life at IIT, which are too big to describe in words, is what makes it different from other colleges. Finally, the convocation which got over the day-before, was probably the final time I would meet most of my college. Friendships forged over a long period of time, will now be strained taut with only the emails and messengers saving it. (Ironical, isn't it, as it is Friendship Day today). I will truly miss all the people whom I have had acquaintance with and felt close.   With the getting of the degree, one of the threads holding us to this honorable institution has now been cut. Only the Alumni Association, can hopefully, keep us in contact. From the first sight of IIT during my early years of life, to now, I have gone through many stages and events, but IIT WILL ALWAYS BE A PART OF MY HEART. A remembrance of who I am and what I am and how much I owe to this noble institution and the country which has it.    That concludes this Mini-series. Hope you had as much fun reading it, as I did, writing it.

      For programmers working on java, IDEA is&nbsp;*the* IDE to use for all development.&nbsp;Most of the other projects like eclipse, visual studio .net 2005&nbsp;are&nbsp;still trying to catch up with the features that this&nbsp;cool&nbsp;IDE provides ( urlLink www.jetbrains.com ).  &nbsp; There is an&nbsp;interview with the CEO of jetbrains at  urlLink www.codegeneration.net  where there is a discussion about "language oriented programming". Makes for a&nbsp; very interesting read. And given their track record of doing things which seem impossible till they are done, I wont be surprised if they strike something big.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I have been going through my mail archives and I came across this in a mail which I wrote to my classmates.   "'Money is not everything da' according to OP who is perhaps the first millionaire amongst us"  The surprising thing was OP was a fairly worldly person and I found it pretty odd that he should say such a thing. In fact, after a few months he quit his plum job and moved on for further studies... So this set me thinking - is there any truth in what he has said? How serious was he in making such a statement?  After years of experience, I now realize that what he said is true - Money is not everything, we need power, fame and position too :-). I realized the basic tenet is that a human being is never happy in absolute terms; he feels good only when has more in relation to others according to some (however arbitrary) criteria - money, power, grades, knowledge, position, looks....  Hmmm.. wonder if evolution is such a big thing after all.  I have intentionally changed the names(initials) here to protect the privacy of individuals concerned :)

      Wanted to learn and write a tutorial on windbg. But you know what, someone beat me to it :(.  http://www.codeproject.com/debug/windbg_part1.asp provides a nice introduction.   Why learn a new debugger? you may ask. Well here are some reasons:       Cool value    Scare your peers when they come to your office (assuming they dont know :) )    You can say, this can be done easily in windbg when you dont know what to do.    It has the wt (call graphs of each call) command     Execute arbitrary commands on break point and continue    Good logging features

      Wiki is an awesome piece of collaborative software which enables anyone with just a browser to contribute and maintain shared information/knowledge. In the past my teams have used it to maintain project level information like faq's, process information relating to build, checkins, codereads, release, new hire pages, install docs and what not.  Usually I find that wiki's are much better than having a set of word documents checked into some project or database for the simple reason that the latter makes it harder to access, make modifications and check them back in. Many issues come up like read/write access to the shared repository, necessity of having some office clone installed on the machine you are currently working on etc. And to round it up, most wikis have cool features like full text search, title search, ability to view history and restore a page etc.. which makes them far more flexible than the usual alternatives.  Once we started using the wiki, the rtfm equivalents on my team have been "Did you read the wiki?", "Can you put that on the wiki?" "why is not on the wiki?" etc.. :)  Want to try it out? Try out the  urlLink  wiki sandbox  .   You can find a lot of implementations to choose from  urlLink  here    If you are in a software company think about why your team is not using a wiki !!

Catching up with my reading as my build gets done and here are my picks:       Interview with Chomsky - it is a  urlLink  must read  . Has references to Animal Farm and to educated people like you and me.    Another interesting article about  urlLink free speech unless it is critical      Makes one wonder if iraqis are the only ones who have opressive regimes

      Who is Tinku ?  We moved recently to a new place to reduce the insane commute times to office. And we landed up at what we thought was a nice apartment complex.   As we settled down and got introduced to neighbours and all, who do I see but this 12 year old kid by the name Tinku calling me 'Uncle'. I took an immediate dislike to him, though I not sure why.  Now he barges into our home whenever he feels like it, shouting 'Uncle' in a shrill voice to tell me about some new thing that he has learnt. I think the fact that my mother gives him something or the other to eat whenever he comes is encouraging him even more.  Now coming to the interesting part - he is hardly the size of my computer table but he already knows the difference between DDR Ram and SD Ram, has his own computer, knows a couple of scripting languages - python and ruby and constantly embarasses me with questions about them.  I decide that he is too young for stuff like this and tell his mother that this is the age to play and it is likely that he will have all kinds of problems in his later years if he does not stop all this immediately.  Instead of taking it in the right spirit, she told me that I should learn more if I can't answer his questions instead of asking him to stop learning. "And I thought you were from IIT" was her last statement as I left in a huff!  Will this next door menace be the creator of the next Sasser Worm? Very possible, unless something is done about it :)  On an entirely unrelated note, I now have a copy of "Python Cookbook".

      Changed the look and feel to something better :)  In addition I have linked to a few other blogs too:  Vishal - was a colleague at  urlLink Trilogy  where we both used to work. He is now heading to IIM A. CAT enthusiasts will find his blog very useful - the way he planned, his concerns, strategy for the test, the gds and the interviews :). If you ask him now - "How do u prepare for cat?" I am sure he will reply "No big deal da. Just mug and go and u will get !" But blogs dont lie, do they ;) ?  Not Srinivas - He was my college junior and a colleague at my current company. In addition he is a CE from ISC.    The rest are assorted techies ...

       urlLink Gullu  has always been one of the greatest performers I have seen when it comes to academics or profession.  So when he  urlLink says  that  there is more to life than grades and a plum job  ,    I can't help but wonder if he is trying to not be a part of my new sadistic defination of IITians.        As per this defination, all IITians are nothing but  Note Chapne ki Machine  ... All their life they do nothing but sit on a table with a xerox machine printing out currency. People come, take the currency and leave to do whatever they want. In return, they give you food, clothes, shelter and sometimes love. This is somewhat similar to the rat race described in Rich Dad, Poor Dad.  I shouldn't take all the credit for this sadistic thought. It came out a few days ago when I was talking to 2-3 friends of mine (Mota, BKP and Vikas). Mota is being placed in Bareilly by his employer where he has nothing but the xerox machine. So now you know where the thought originated from.  So if I know all this, then why am I not doing anything to make life worthwhile. Well, I am trying for sure.

      My general opinion on  Friendship day  (or any such day for that matter) is that these days have been defined by Greeting Card companies to promote their sales. However, I have been pretty nostalgic in the past few days remembering the good old days of college and bangalore. Maybe because delhi still doesn't provide me the same home feeling as I used to have in these two places. The tragedy of my kind of life is that we keep on moving, changing places and in the process, go far away from the great friends we make. Time once gone never comes back, but I am happy to say that I spent the best days of my life so far during IIT and Bangalore and I am proud that I have such great friends. A big thank you to all of you my dear friends ... Hail friendship and hail Shakti for being so much more lucky than Sanjay.

      I have been pretty involved one of the video games from  The legend of Zelda  series, namely  The Ocarina of Time . An adventurous game, I have already spent 3 weeks on it and I have not yet reached half stage.    This game was made for the Nintendo 64 console in 1995. Even though made almost a decade ago, it has decent graphics and the sound effects and music are just fantastic. It still remains one of the most popular games for N64 console.   Thanks to certain good  urlLink N64 emulators  and  urlLink walkthroughs  (and less work load in office ;-), I have been able to enjoy it on my pc.    This added with the fact that there have not been any good movie releases since lakshya, there is really not much stuff to blog.

      Finally saw Lakshya. Based on the Kargil war, I found the movie pretty decent to watch. For once, I didn't find performance by any actor exceptionally good or bad. Though I did feel that while amitabh bachchan looked good without his frenchie, he looked a bit old for the part of commanding officer.   There are two things that I liked about the movie. Firstly, the photography. There were some great scenes of the himalayas and the leh route. The scenery is beautiful. Then there is an exceptional sequence of rock climbing in the himalayas. Second is the song  Main aisa kyun hoon . While I have never been the biggest fan of the actor Hritik, I think he is one of the best dancers the industry has ever produced. The song and his dance on it has a freshness attached with it. And Hritik has not done badly with acting either.  Two points on the character of Preity Zinta. One .. Hritik runs away from military training. She says that she doesn't want to meet him again. Two .. she is engaged to another guy. She wants to go to Kargil but this guy doesn't want her to go. Guess what, she returns her engagement ring immediately and goes to Kargil. Is this what they call love?

      Google started Gmail on 1st April, 2004 with a big bang but a handful of test users. Now after two and half months, they have started rapidly increasing their userbase through invitations. Being a gmail member since quite some time now, I am getting gmail invites almost everyday since past few days. This makes me feel that the final release of Gmail is not very far away now.  The whole concept of 1 GB mailboxes triggered a revolution. One one hand, sites like  urlLink AventureMail  and  urlLink SpyMac  tried to take the initial advantage by providing the same or higher disk space before gmail goes public and thus increase their userbase. On the other hand, existing portals like  urlLink Yahoo  and  urlLink Rediff  have also increased their disk quotas. However, my personal opinion is that Google will still emerge as the leader with Yahoo as closest competitor. The primary reason here is because google's technology is far more superior than others. They have developed something called  Google OS , great technology for  backup and failure recovery . On top of it, They provide a great UI. Gullu has already written a  urlLink review  from a user's perspective. Yahoo will remain because of its spam filter(which is the best I have seen so far), messenger program and other portals like photos, briefcase, yahoogroups etc. But other sites don't have much to offer. Reminds me of Netscape and IE war.  P.S. Ping me in case anyone needs a Gmail account :-)

      The thing with maintaining a blog is that half the time I end up writing because I'm tired of seeing the same starting line of the last entry everytime I visit MY blog (to check out what MY written material looks on screen and all that sort of a thing).I was just lying around on my bed thinking deeply about how the week had gone, thinking... about the HORRIBLE organic chemistry test that I wrote today, wondering if I could have humanly screwed it up any more(sigh!). Can't really blame me though. The whole week is spent in keeping up with school or writing records or something so...where is the time to study for a test? And the reason gains even more justification when the subject for the test is organic chemistry!  My tuition batch consists of roughly about 26 students. Young, zealous, waiting to be moulded, desperate to learn more... are some of the characteristics that you might link with a bunch of 16,17 (18??) year olds. Well, look at it optimistically(as my dad would say) . You might have been even further away from the truth. Except for the young part, the other parts are pure elephant's shit.Zealous be damned and desperate to learn? YE GODS! I've never seen a more disinterested bunch of gargoyles.For example, today for the test; only half the class turned up;and out of the half that did turn up 5 people gave up on the one and a half hour test after about ahem.. 20 minutes. And mind you this is a drastic improvement; back in April it used to be 10 minutes and believe me I'm (for once) NOT exaggerating. Not that they are dumb or anything...just plain disinterested and I hate it when I've to sit for 3 hours in the sort of environment where everyone looks like hey its Buffy the vampire slayer time and look its the return of the decaying zombies!!The chemistry teacher obviously doesnt offer big time contribution since, as a bonus, I also get to hear her drawl on forever about the preparation of RDX!!( I mean to say RDX,the explosive)what the hell were those CBSE dudes and dudettes thinking anyway? Anyone would think that they wanted India to be full of terrorists or kidnappers(yeh, we did cholroform too) .  I know what you are thinking (you= general junta)..you are thinking get a life ya moron! If you don't have anything to write about then say it straight! But alas! the numerous history papers that I've written in my previous years of err ''education'' make sure that I say anything 'if and only if' I've about a gazillion ways of beating around the bush and then slowly, gradually WHEN the need arises, make half hearted attempts to get to the point!  The fact is, that my life currently revolves (or apparently revolves) around academics; so bear with moi woes, fellow earthlings is all I can say.  Anyway you can let the fresh air in now; I just caught sight of the Floyd-Relics album on my table. The music has a slight weirdness to it but then it is Floyd and whats more, its brilliant!There is this song called 'remember a day' that is currently on my hitlist.  Climb your favorite apple tree Try to catch the sun Hide from your little brother's gun Dream yourself away -Floyd.

      &nbsp;    There is a definite increase in the entropy of my room. The main cause might ofcourse be the ''recent'' (they finished today!) set of tests that I had . The whole week, needless to say has been about a series of equations, reactions, derivations, weird mechanisms involving a salamander's and cockroach's nutrition intake and digestive system respectively. It has ofcourse, also been about my classmates and I endlessly ranting about how 'we wished we could lay our hands on that idiot Gauss who couldnt mind his own business and had to go around making laws about electric flux; and that moron who invented integration' and blah blah but then, thats really pretty normal; I can't, technically speaking call it exam paranoia. What I infer about 12th std till now is that the major thing for you to do is to write tests.Class tests, cumulative tests, tuition tests, unit tests...you would think they would atleast run out of names or something but they just keep experiencing brilliance and when they run out of suitable prefixes for 'tests' they just replace the word tests with exams and voila my life is about 50 times more miserable!! &nbsp; So obviously my room is in a complete state of chaos. All the people I know (for eg:relatives, friends blah) have this tendency of giving me their old books right after they are done with their academic year. They tell me that they have only ''my best interests at heart'' but I KNOW BETTER there's no room for thrash in my room, you dope; so you take it! is what they are really thinking.   I've been listening to the beatles and stuff and honestly some of their stuff's really good!&nbsp;I mean half the time people are just discrediting them because they are supposed to be like&nbsp;the jhang jhang types and not the pukka fundoo rock that is ''in'' these days. But&nbsp;its like real nice and acoustic; atleast some of their stuff is and hell they've about a gazillion albums! If all of them turned out right&nbsp;I would probably get scared and chuck listening to them!The best part is that my dads always liked them and all so I would've heard most of the tapes that I'm listening to (voluntarily) now. I love it when stuff like that happens, like you think that you are going to listen to a song for the first time but you find that you already know the words and the tune and stuff&nbsp; and its even better if you end up liking the music! Currently theres this song called blackbird on. Here are some of the words: &nbsp; Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise. Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these sunken eyes and learn to see All your life  You were only waiting for this moment to be free. Blackbird fly  Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night.  Ah how could I forget; I still havent come to the sob story part!( general message: that means that the parts till now dont categorize as sob storyish. Right ho! just making things a little clear for the uninitiated). Those cable tv maddy geese have gone on some strike or something so no cable tv and to think I&nbsp;had been nurturing hopes of seeing atleast the news( talking &nbsp;about desperation,&nbsp;I wonder how my friends from school manage...they have only dd1 now that would classify as UNDILUTED TORTURE!!)&nbsp;on my two-week-something old tv which I haven't experienced whole heartedly yet.  The phone's dead as well. The only thing that is left is the power supply but then it had its share of (F*****) cuts all through my goddamn tests.   All this activation of unused energy has made me hungry so I'll go now...sit around listen to the beatles and go speak sweet words to my mum so she'll fix me a snack.

      Okay! So it has been PRETTY long since I last updated this thing. And no, my life hasn’t got down in the doldrums or become terribly boring or anything of the sort. It is just that I haven’t been able to find the time to sit down and actually WRITE something and of course there is also the possibility that I have gotten as lazy as I could get in recent times but ah well, why look at the demoralizing side effects of summer vacations.  I for one am in awe of holidays. They are in a world of their own. They STAND out. Days of complete leisure, a slow uptake on everything that comes your way and other things of this caliber are what holidays are all about. Trust me to see the bright side of the whole thing two days before school reopens. Last week I was probably cribbing about how there was ABSOLUTELY nothing to do. But now, with the prospect of school being 48 hours away, the trees outside suddenly seem like objects in paradise. I might have not minded going back to school and everything. You always get used to stuff like that (thank god for small mercies). But OBVIOUSLY there IS a catch. Right on the reopening day, starting from the English teacher to the principal, everyone is generously handing out these HUMUNGOUS lectures about how we should be completely refreshed after a 50 day break and get ready to hit the books. And of course they also announce the last year board exam results ‘officially’. And it just isn’t my cup of tea to hear about how people blissfully got a freaking 97.999% in class 12th especially because, after hearing about a living example; the whole thing suddenly doesn’t seem too impossible to my parents and the rest of the ‘oh we are your well wishers’ gang and everyone is trying (tactfully) to tell me that I’m supposed to get a score that is something like that even if it is not accurately that. And of course they will NEVER say it straight to my face. They’ll say something like ‘do us proud’ and then I find myself just stuck there.  The power’s been gone since yesterday evening. It is strange really, just a while back I was thinking if I’ll be able to manage without technology and the likes. Well! That is a pretty quick reply I must say. Who the heck except the ghost of Darwin cares about survival of the fittest anyway?  I WANT FAN!  I’ve been reading ‘Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance’ that is to say fitting it between meals and blah. It has been a pretty decent book till now; has some interesting pointers and everything. Otherwise I’m ‘reading’ R.D Sharma- Math for higher secondary; application of derivatives; we even have a test on that today. Constructive way to spend study time, writing about power cuts and so on I must say. Ah well. Okay! It is time to read the omens again. The power’s back, Led Zeppelin’s on in the music system, I have had a good breakfast and reluctantly if I may say so, it is time to apply differentiation.

      31/05/04 It is not like I’ve anything against rains. In fact, rains are quite nice; but that is mostly when you are sitting by the window in the warmth of your house, with a good book to read. What I don’t fancy, is the idea of getting stuck, after 3 hours of grueling tuitions in the middle of a busy road when the auto driver asks my friend and me to please get out since he couldn’t possibly go any further. We spent the next 20 minutes walking in knee deep ‘water’ (God knows what else we must have stepped in). The market that we were walking in was definitely amazing. And the jerks that were standing outside shops jeering at all the vehicles that got stuck in the slush and laughing their what not off at poor, troubled people like my friend and me were even more amazing. But some of the people were really concerned. There were people who were actually standing outside their houses to warn pedestrians so that they wouldn’t fall in the drain. I then had to call my dad up to come and pick us up. We had to wait for another hour IN THE RAIN till my dad arrived like a saint who performed kind acts for those who weren’t too privileged or whatever. Anyway I reckon it is going to be pretty wet and ‘ichak pichak’ for a while. So everyone might as well get used to it.

      26/05/04 I got back to the general tuitions regime this week. After a week which consisted mostly of lazing around, “playing” some tennis, reading, music and other things which have no connection whatsoever to the “revision” that I was supposed to be doing, getting back to the mundane routine was almost traumatic! But anyway, I’m kinda getting used to it, so maybe after about 10 months (by which time, 12th would be done with for good (hopefully) I would’ve definitely blended in.  My dad returned from his first ever trip to the U S of A, yesterday. Owing to the fact that my relatives have equally distributed themselves in the U.S and Bangalore, I’ve heard my dad’s version of his trip, roughly about 15.5 times (yeah, by the 15.5th time I was definitely PUKKOFIED) But anyway, it was pretty interesting to hear about a foreign lifestyle and everything. From the sound of it, Americans seem to do everything in a XXL size. Apparently, they buy HUGE groceries, use extensive amounts of electricity and water and are also pretty huge themselves. Basically, they WASTE everything that they have. Some guy, after hearing that my dad was from India, asked him whether he was from some tribe or something. After a detailed explanation from my dad about how people in India aren’t mostly tribal but are actually pretty civilized and that India was in the south of Asia, NOT Africa; the guy nodded enlightenment and finally when my dad was about to leave, asked him if he could meet up with him when he was visiting Chile next month!  But other than that it seems an alright place. I saw a couple of photographs and it is almost shocking how even the trees look perfectly fresh and green. My dad had difficulty breathing for a while, since he couldn’t quite get used to the fact that the place was completely dust free! It is tragic how India is unlikely to ever reach those standards.  ARGH power cut!!! This is happening too often these days.So much for “India Shining’’!

      ''A little to the left, yeah thats it! Now, raise your head, a little more to the right DON'T MOVE!!'' And no there wasn't a trace of zeal in that voice.On the contrary, it was as disinterested, morose and boring as any hairstylist's voice could get. She needn't have wasted so much of her precious energy to tell me that. The moment I sat in the chair, I'd accepted even the intake of Oxygen with some reluctance.   Now, I'm definitely not the kind of person who could be too bothered about what sheI looks like and blah. But my hair(God bless it) has this tendency of growing breadthwise more than it has the tendency to grow lenghtwise. So, after a couple of''Sneha, tie your hair; we can't see the T.V screen'' remarks from my dear family members I decided that there was no choice but to embark and get a hair cut.  ''Take your glasses off'' mademoiselle hairstylist barked at me. I would call that order pretty smart since without my glasses, my clear vision is limited to about a distance of 20 cm from my eyes and in comparison with that the mirror was quite far away. The next moment I heard a whisper in my ear ''it'll cost you 120 ruppees''; and it'll cost you about 50,000 frosty nosed killing stares from my mum you cold witch I whispered inaudibly (I hope)  So, all this being settled the process finally began. With my limited vision I saw black hair all over the floor...MY HAIR. After about 20 minutes of undiluted discomfort and misery ''done'' she yelled. With trembling hands I reached for my specs and took a closer look in the mirror; I was too much in a daze to even scream at the horror that looked back at me. My dear mother, on the other hand who was giving the renowned ''hairstylist'' the 50,000 stares (mentioned earlier) while handing out the 120 bucks started off on some big time''Oh, sweetheart don't worry about it. You look just fine. You have to try new styles, you know'' dialogue frenzy. ''Right ho'' I mumbled, now completely convinced that along with looking like a half evolved specimen from the distant lands of planet Zog, I now looked like a  half evolved specimen from the distant lands of planet Zog with weird hair. moral: Don't trust hairstylists who sound morose. They are probably facing serious problems in their lives and want to take their anger out in novel ways; for eg:cutting your hair and making you look more like a monster than the average homo sapien.Amen.

      15/05/04 It is time to get your popcorn bowls out and wait for the grand finale. Alright corny I admit but I’m just quoting from that stupid newspaper…yeah! Times of India! For the life of me I can’t figure out the hype that is attached with the whole affair. I mean yes, ‘elections decide the future of this country’…blah…but, what I’m trying to say is that its more like everyone’s betted their lives on who’s going to win the goddamn lottery or something!  BJP lost, Congress won and instead of considering the fact that the former party is headed by an old man who probably has difficulty walking, let alone think of the welfare of a country whose population is one of the largest in today’s world (Incidentally, I don’t know what relevance this has to anything but as a kid; I used to be proud of the fact that India had the second biggest janasankhya. I also used to be proud of the fact that I was living in the largest continent and…OKAY snap out of it you ignoramus I say to myself and get back to the point) I mean, with all due respect to Mr Vajpayijee; I think he did a pretty decent job and everything but I also think that he…err shouldn’t strain himself too much at this…err…ripe old age. So anyway instead of considering all this and looking more optimistically at the whole situation AND acknowledging the fact that maybe Sonia has more to her than an accented language, (I speak as a mere onlooker here, I mean I wouldn’t really know too much about Mrs Gandhi so as to decide whether she would make an able P.M for our country.) what do people do? They crib about her foreign origin!!!  The main point that everyone seems to be missing here is that at least there is a likely possibility that Sonia may not emphasize on all that religion bullshit that the NDA were so intent on. Ah well! What is there to do but to watch and wait…and tell myself to stop being so desperate and do just about anything (which includes writing A class zilch) to get away from that fat physics book.
