        Good Eats   So all along I thought I didn't like eggrolls...who knew that I was so very wrong?? One night while sitting down to some takeout I watched as others enjoyed the crunchy goodness and I could no longer resist. That was the night of my first bite and there has been no turning back! I am loving them so much that I want to have one everyday!! I started craving them! I was afraid I wouldn't be able to support my new habit ~ so with my dear husband's encouragement (and empty belly) I learned to make them myself! The turn out wasn't too bad - definitely room for improvement but tasty none the less.  So for my photo of the day....Here is the making of the Homemade Takout.   Raw EggRolls Being Fried To A Good Crunchy State      EggRolls Being Browned In The Wok      Sesame Chicken Noodles With Red Pepper Entering The Oven      The Drum Roll Please - Final Presentation     Countdown to the weekend has begun: one and a half hours to go   LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

        Free Book Tuesday    So yesterday I walk into my house to find a package at the front door. Who doesn't love a free package? Turns out that as a result of submitting my name to a book club leaders website/forum I have been choosen to receive an advanced copy of a soon to be released book. So aside from liking free packages - who desn't like to be given something in advance of everyone else?  but wait....theres more!  If I respond to the publishing house by March 1st with my book club's size and the date we would be reviewing the book...We will get a free copy of the book for all club members PLUS on the day we review the book we will get an Alaskan (part of the book takes place in Alaska) seafood basket to enjoy during our discussion. Now mind you I dont care for seafood but the marketing idea behind this is just great!!  SO...I hereby reinstate the GF Bookclub (that may or may not have ever existed in the first place). Now I just need to find some members that like seafood!   Applause and kudos to the geniuses at  urlLink TooFar  Publishing for sending me the book!  THEN - on my way home last night I was driving down my street when I came across a book in the road. My curiosity got the best of me and I had to go see what it was. As an avid lover of books - I couldn't let is just lay in the street - what if it was a book released into the wild by  urlLink BookCrossings  (which I am just dying to come across some day!!). So I picked it up and turned it over to find a copy of 365 Days of Bible Verses...now what am I to do? I can't leave a bible in the road...especially on the eve of Ash Wednesday. I brought it into the house. I may be intrigued enough to read some of it...or release it back into the wild - we shall see!

      ok - so here I am starting what I didn't think would be possible for me...In hopes that I can start to create a daily entry to capture important or not so important nuances of my life. In starting each day with a picture of the day I hope to 1. Get good use of this digital camera and 2. Create a visual reminder of the year. Some things you may get to read about: my experiments with photography and recipes, reviews of some of my favorite things, great ideas in marketing, books or music I am currently enjoying, and any other good things I come across and don't want to loose.  So let the fun begin!

        My Day In Tea     Well I log in today and try to make some more fun changes and all I get is the white screen of blog...UGH! I screwed up my template and had to restart...bugger!  anyway   Thought I should let you know that I am doing my part to will spring here. I have a new hairdo ~ new make-up colors (very spring like) and I am sipping on Pink Lemonade Tea! Now spring just has to do its part!!   And if spring takes its time getting here...then the cozy taste of Vanilla will hold me over!   And in honor of my much needed vacation I will hopefully get some of this tasty treat while enjoying the cherry blossoms in our nations Capitol    So yes - there it is my day in some of my favorite teas! Which brings me to my most recent quandary...  How should one feel when they are a part of something and it all of the sudden takes off and becomes more mainstream? At times one can feel great being in on the early end of some new trend - take tea drinking for example...I have always been a tea girl never coffee! Now all of the sudden tea is everywhere - some restaurants even have  urlLink tea sommeliers.  On one hand its great - the thing you love becomes wide spread more variety enters into the market and your choice are now expanded upon. But on the other hand the exclusiveness / uniqueness of your group is gone. Selfish? Perhaps!  I have also been on the other end of this with the recent widespread knitting craze. I go with my husband to visit his grandfather in the nursing home. While there I come across a woman who is making the most fun scarf I have ever seen. I fall in love with it and vow that I will learn how to make one myself. So I head to the store and find that apparently everyone else has the exact same idea. All the sudden the uniqueness of making my own scarf is slightly diminished. Locally the craze became so bad that I was practically on a waiting list for black fun fur yarn!   Finally I finished my scarf and I love the thing - I see why so many people want to have one. I love to wear the crazy thing! So I am thankful to all the other knitters who let me into their "club" and I shall take it as a lesson to be less smug in my own future endeavors.   urlLink ');" target="_self"> postCount(' ');    |  urlLink ');" target="_self"> postCountTB(' ');

        A Worthy Site    I have blogged too long without talking about one of my all time favorite sites!  urlLink Expoldingdog  gets my seal of approval!  ~~~Official Seal of Approval~~~  the site opperator (sam) allows people to submit titles to which he then (if he feels the urge) creates a sketch to match. My favorites usually involve  urlLink stars , or are  urlLink witty , or are done in just  urlLink black and red . The best part is the pics are already the perfect size for saving as a desktop background. Enjoy!   Title: can you see me when you  look

        Spring   Well my attempts at willing spring here have not quite worked... But yesterday on the way to my car I did notice a dead bee in the parking lot. A small sign that spring is trying to come - but it can't be here just yet!  RANDOM THOUGHT: Wouldn't  urlLink Doggie Howser, M.D.  be super impressed with Blogging?   So the trip out of town was great - offered time for introspective thoughts. Mostly inspired by music through the week. A friend (p.l.) once commented on how computer terms have seeped into our everyday language - a realization of this was made when I quiped "when we get home I have to delete some of the stuff in my closet" as I said it I knew it was wrong but at the same time I couldn't figure out what the right word was that I was looking for...crazy!  Anyway - I have some ideas running through my head about journaling. Getting some life goals and plans out on paper or blog (that is the current debate). Also thinking of starting one for some great marketing work ideas so they dont slip away.  anyway - I should get back to work for now...maybe to return here later. In the meantime check out the link to my blog of stuff I would love to own (over in the link section to the left ("no dayna your other right")  ciao!

        This Just In...    This just in... a response to the  HOT DOG DANGER  feature of yesterday...   "Lets institue a law requiring the mandatory puree'ing of all foods until the  legal voting age of 18  1 child every 5 days? shit thats only 73 kids, not even 2 per state per year!  New rule, since riding in a car obviously kills more kids that hotdogs let  us outlaw children from being in cars unless they are going to daycare or  for medical reasons, hell lets just keep them lying in bed until they are 18  Fear marketing, journalist and vigalante's looking for somethign to talk  about.  Obviously talking to parents about universal choking hazards for kids, yes  of course. Hotdogs contribute to the choking hazard, That lady never spoke  of the skins adding extra dangers.  A parent probably should not be feeding anything to a child so full of  preservatives and ambiguous in origin anyway.  (MY FAVORITE PART!!!)   clink... clink... my two cents"   -from my dear sweet husband!!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *********Now....Back to our program!********* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  So here I am strolling through the web today and come across a site that I instantly fealt a connection to!!

        Important To Know    Please note the dangers of hot dogs:      urlLink  "I am an educated person but I never realized how dangerous a hot dog could be."     urlLink Here some mom's discuss alternative ways to serve hot dogs     "Always supervise young children while they're eating or playing. Don't allow children under age 6 to eat round or hard foods like peanuts, other nuts, raw carrots, popcorn, seeds or hard candy. They also should not eat hot dogs or grapes unless the skin is removed and the food is chopped into small, non-round pieces. Keep small items such as coins, safety pins, jewelry and buttons out of children's reach. Learn First Aid and CPR"   urlLink to read more...       ~keep in touch~

        The Great Deletion   The great Deletion of 2004 is well underway! The slimming down and removal of excess from my life has begun; quite successfully I might add. Tim refers to it as Marriage version 2.0. A good time to purge all the crap that we have collected for one reason or another (and I say we that means mostly me!!).  What started out as a small closet cleaning resulted in a six hour project that saw us taking 6 garbage bags, 2 giant pottery barn bags, and 3 boxes of clothes to the local thrift shop (a great little place that sells all clothing for a $1 the last time I checked). We also dropped off two giant boxes of random kitchen accessories that I was keeping in our attic just-in-case "what if while making one pitcher of margaritas I also need to puree potato soup?" ahhh what would Martha do??  a photo of the completion of phase one...     LESSON LEARNED~  "A Garage Sale Price Can Make Crap Look Nice"  When there is something I want I should really save until I have the money to buy exactly what I want. It is far better to spend $60 on a sweater you will wear often then spend $10 each on 6 sweaters which will hang in your closet for all of eternity. There were a few items in my closet which fit this description - so I took photos of me wearing the worst offenses and will keep them close to my credit card to serve as a retail reminder!  So now in keeping with the spirit of the GREAT DELETION project here is the list of the rest of the house I would like to thin out... stay tuned for updates and photos of my progress.  · spare dresser in the dining room · mom's dresser (apparently I have some clothing lingering over here too) · the attic (to be brokecategories catagories later) · top drawer of my drrecipeÃÂ· my receipe collection (needs some good organization to it) · the kitchen (all cabinets need a good going over)  ok so that is my personal deleting goal - which is sure to expand as I see fit.   ~keep in touch~

        Signs of Spring    So it would seem as though my religious principals are crooked (as  urlLink Mitch Hedberg  would say...dont see him if he is in your town - he is even better after a lengthy roadtrip). One would imagine that the onset of lent would be a good indication that the rebirth caused by spring was well on its way. Well what if you dont partake in lent? What else would alert one to the fact that spring and for that matter that easter are just around the bend?  Why PEEPS Marshmallow-y treats of course!! Once these sugary confections start arriving in stores I know that a trip to the Broadway Market is not far off.  so today a dedication to easter basket goodness...  A creative goal for the weekend may be to try to assemble these cuties!!   (thanks to martha for these...that woman is an amazing multi-tasker...she can fight legal battles all while creating a slew of spring time "Good Thing's" this is the kind of woman D.Trump needs on his team!)  So if you are as crazy as me you can attempt this step-by-step method to create your own:   urlLink Martha's Version   or if you want to know how peeps are really made, buy cool peeps merchandise, or see great peeps crafts and receipes...check out their very own  urlLink homepage .  If that attempt fails miserably it will be off to pay a visit to my good friends at WHAM-O who have been so kind as to create a PEEPS TREAT MAKER.    Lastly - dont eat the darn things fresh or out-of-season!!!  Happy SPRING!

        Disgrunteled Consuming    Why is it that advertisers feel the need to intice me with such very small rewards and then not pay out?   - Tim Hortons ...you spend oodles of money on your Roll Up The Rim To Win game...so why is it that you can't give every single person at least a free Tim Bit. How do you expect us to go to work with a positive attitude when I start out the moring with such phrases as "try again". Might as well just go back to bed and start off fresh tomorrow. If you dont have enough money to give everyone who plays some very small food bit - then please just make a few large prizes that I will also not win. And while we are on the subject - can't you just make a peel off piece? I suggest you take the advice of the Mc'Opoly people... or is it that you have an in with the pshychiatrists who are now treating patients who are pretty sure that just last week they threw out the large ticket winning game piece?   - Pepsi  My compalint to you is similar to that of the mini doughnut folks. Why if you have tons of money to invest in a promotion that you can't give everyone a free iTunes download? I know that you did not pay .99 per song. Would it have killed you to let everyone get a winning game piece? Maybe it would have...maybe you would have suffered a large financial loss if everyone of your loyal consumers won a drink. DOUBT IT!!! If that was the case you would have done a better job hiding the fact if a bottle was a winning bottle or not.  urlLink See how to get a winner everytime ? Even if you dont - check it out anyway - the pictures are great!!  So I am not going to fall for the tom foolery advertising campaigns any longer. I am off to buy a plain tim bit and the new Nora Jones song.   Total Cost =$1.18  Disapointment Level = NONE No Marketing Data Collected From Me = Priceless

        Am I Alone    Ok so am I alone in the fact that anytime there is a commercial for the Ronco Rotissere Cooker I get ZOMBIE EYES. I just cant stop watching because I have to see the bizarre solid food injector part!     so here is the deal on the piece...  "The Solid Food Injector allows you to infuse whole foods such as garlic, sundried tomatoes, olives, apricots, apples, pineapple, onions, basil, oregano and more right into your foods for incredible flavor!"    Dear Mr. Popeil  Why do you make such un-natural dinners? No one slices open a turkey expecting to see whole garlic cloves or apple pieces - let alone a giant black olive staring back at them. Although I will not be purchasing your ghastly invention I will be watching your infomercial over and over. Maybe you should cosider selling a DVD version of the solid food injector in use - a cult following would surely be created!  Sincerely, Viewer with Deer in Headlights Look

        Cigarettes Bad - Art Good.    Well here is a twist on making something old new again and a kitschy one at that. Who doesn't remember the good ol' pull handle cigarette machines? We are talking the kind that didn't have automatic dollar slots or push button coding like the beasts of now a days...  Anyway - someone with some entrepreneurial spirit turned the little buggers into an art dispenser. Now you know I just wanna have one of these! And if I cant have my very own - then who wants to roadtrip with me??  urlLink Have one near you ?? Let me know!  urlLink Want your own art in one ?  Check them out:  urlLink Art*o*Mat        and since we are talking vending machines...I just read an article about a potential replacement for the convenience store. Imagine a giant full wall vending machine featuring everything from pantyhose to pop! Although this isn't the original image it gives you an idea. Check out the  urlLink original article . It may have a few flaws but in the right venue (hotel lobbies, university campuses) minus some flaws (brake-in ability) it has some great potential!

        The Great Deletion - An Update      Since the first great deletion project I have remained fairly steady in coming up with more action plans at eliminating extra crap from my life. I even sifted through hundreds (I am not kidding) of ripped out recipes to find ones that I may attempt and put them in clear plastic sleeves sorted by meal type! Now I just need to actually prepare some of them...and if they are good add some digital photos - and if they don't make the cut - toss them out!  Most recently I have started to sort through some of the many books I have been holding on to. Typically I will read a book once - so this notion of holding them to re-read for someday is bunk! I think I have reread a book only once - EVER! So I created a little list and headed over to  urlLink half.com  where I am selling them to others who may love them too! So far so good in two days I have made $28 not bad!! Money is always a good motivator! Check out what I am  urlLink selling .  So overall I am feeling great on slimming down on my junk - tonight me and the hubby will be conducting a kitchen redo. We will delete what we don't need and move other less used pieces to better locations in the house - see ya later wok - to the attic with you. This should result in another happy part of the house - the first being my uncluttered closet!  I still haven't parted with the high school graphing calculator - BABY STEPS!!

        A Little Competition Is a Good Thing!     OK so it has to be a little under a week ago when I first heard the radio industries anti-satellite radio ads. Have you heard them? They are the one where supposed patrons who have used or thought of using the system decided against it and give you their lame excuses. My personal favorite being something along the lines of..."They allow swear words to be aired...Its just a disgrace" you can hear them here:  urlLink http://www.radiotown.net/audio/  or just listen to local talk radio. One is more ridiculous then the next.  I was always taught in business and marketing classes that competition was a good thing. If you had a product or service that people liked and used, that is you set yourself apart from the others in some sort of niche that you would succeed. We were told that competition would serve to keep you on your toes - to always be offering the best that you could for your patrons. So why is it now a days that industries that have been around for ages are feeling entitled to operate without such competitors? Customization is KEY - people want to feel like they have options.  To read a better put together piece on this check out what Mark Ramsey has to say about it on the radio industry blog:  urlLink Radio Marketing Nexus

        Determine Your Personality Through Shapes & Color     Find out more about your personality through  urlLink shape and color . This is a quick personality test. I choose a first and second.  Here are my responses:  Introspective Sensitive Reflective    You come to grips more frequently and thoroughly with yourself and your environment than do most people. You detest superficiality; you'd rather be alone than have to suffer through small talk. But your relationships with your friends are very strong, which gives you the inner tranquility and harmony that you require. You do not mind being alone for extended periods of time; you rarely become bored.    and my second...   Down to Earth Well-Balanced Harmonious   You value a natural style and love that which is uncomplicated. People admire you because you have both feet planted firmly on the ground and they can depend on you. You give those who are close to you security and space. You are perceived as being warm and human. You reject everything that is garish and trite. You tend to be skeptical toward the whims of fashion trends. For you, clothing has to be practical and unobtrusively elegant.   Enjoy and let me know your results...or send me a link to more fun self revealing quizzes!

        Dylan & Panties     I may be alone when I say I like the new Bob Dylan and Victoria's Secret commercial. What is it I like? Not sure... I can't quite get a grip on the whole thing. Now mind you I am a Dylan fan - but not a huge VS fan. Here is my breakdown of the commercial:  -Haunting background music -  LOVE IT  I guess the raspyness of the song could help define rugged sexiness on some level.  -Black & White Imagery -  LOVE IT  definitely gives an edgy sexiness as well.  -Lyrics -  NOT SURE   "I'm sick of love I wish I'd never met you"  I like the lyrics for my own reason - which I am sure are not the same reason they were chosen for this ad spot.  -Venice Back Drop -  LOVE IT  Yep   - that also sells sex appeal  -Dylan In The Ad -  NOT SURE  I think he has a certain sex appeal - but I wasn't so sure that was the same market that buys under garments from VS!  -Model Wearing Dylan's Cowboy Hat  -  LIKE IT  We had a theory in HS that if a girl tried to wear a guys hat - she had some sort of crush going on. Another interesting twist on this rugged sex appeal.  THE MESSAGE - alright this is where the whole thing is lost on me.  any ideas other then...."Hey old 60's rocker look at me Im half naked and young enough to be your daughter"  ok that's creepy!  Have another idea?? Fill me in!!

        Music Funk     Over the last month or so I have not been able to go to our CD shelf and finding something I was excited to listen to. A musical funk has descended upon our house. I even tried to listen to some of the very first music I ordered the first time I joined Columbia House - that kept me entertained for a little while. It is amazing that I can remember lyrics to songs I haven't heard in over 6 years - but try to recite French vocabulary I have been given a week ago and FORGET IT!!  Anyway this all got me to thinking about the very first record I ever owned...and I am not counting the entire Care Bares Collection or Songs That Make You Giggle records. I am talking about the first record that I consciously choose for myself. I received it as a gift for a years worth of good grades (note this was the only time I got a good grades gift. After that year I was told "Your good grades are your present!" and "You don't get gifts for expected behavior" aha fine parenting at work)     what fun times I had playing this record over and over again. My mom used to make me wear headphones so she didn't have to hear it on repeat mode. Only problem is when I wore headphones I would sing out loud - which you would want to hear is a real toss up!  So what was your first record, tape, 8-trak? Help me get out of the funk - suggest some music you think I would enjoy!

        A Good Ending     Well ... over the weekend I finished the book I was reading.   Life of Pi   by Yann Martel. Fantastic is all I can say! A good book for challenging the way you beleive in a higher being. I know there was a lot of hype about this one - beleive it - it was a great read!  As you may remember I was sent a free advanced reading copy of Wild Animus. I also just received the other 10 copies for some friends to join me in the reading. We shall all share some seafood as we dish about this one. I think it may be difficult to read so I am going to co-read the Lovely Bones at the same time.  and in case you were wondering the WOK has moved to the attic - the NEW kitchen is slowly taking shape :)

        McMARKETING      McDonalds, after realizing that is helping our nation "grow" to astronomic proportions has developed a new food plan.  Is the new "Get Fit" meal is aimed to ward off some of the criticisms? The new meal is an adult Happy Meal that would contain a salad, bottled water, and in place of a toy a pedometer to encourage walking.  We have all seen McD's try this health route before to no avail...What makes this approach different?? The Free Prize - I imagine that will have some appeal for a while but in the end will the result still be that America likes McD's for a variety of reasons - none of which are their healthy menu!

        MBA     Well tonight will mark the end of the first (but not last) season of the APPRENTICE. Let me just say that I LOVE this show. Reality TV meets marketing and sales - what better way to spend some down time? At first I feel some guilt for watching reality tv but I easily justify it by looking at the show as a career boosting 1 hour free seminar!  So what will the end result be?? Will they guy with the real life experiences of owning business' win over the one with an Ivy league MBA?   Which brings me to a thought that I had over the weekend. Would it be possible to earn a self given MBA? Certainly there would be no official certificate of completion...but the idea runs something like this...  1. Make a list of those industry experts whom I admire. 2. Contact said members of list and inform them of my goal (self earned MBA) 3. Ask them to make a list of books that they have read and would feel are beneficial 4. Review list of resulting readings and then choose an order 5. Dig in and digest the readings.  Would this have the desired results I am looking for? Not receiving a traditional MBA but being comfortable in the fact that I have considerable knowledge on the subject -coupled with the real life experience.   and if yes - what other areas could I apply it to... Maybe that culinary degree I would also like to have? Are the above steps sufecient enough or would there be more required?  So the question is posed what amount of research and reading would make one proficient in an area (of course assuming that comprehension and retention were a given)? Or on the other hand... Would it not work i.e. "Hey dayna I know you read 5 books about cake baking and decorating and you have experimented...but this girl over here - she took all three Wilton Cake classes - she is more knowledgeable then you!"  send me your thoughts - can self teaching be just as good as a school based education?

        Something is Fishy     That would be my freezer to be exact. Remember a while ago - when I started this blog, I posted about a publishing company that sent me a free book and promised one for all member of my book club? While they have delivered HUGE! Not only did they send me a free copy of the book WILD ANIMUS for all members of the club but they also sent me two of the Taste of Alaska seafood packages from  urlLink Ed's Kasilof Seafood . Here is the packages contents:  Taste of Alaska   A unique variety of wild Alaskan Seafoods. Includes 1 lb. of smoked salmon spread, 1 lb. of smoked salmon, 1 lb. of smoked halibut, 1 lb. of fresh frozen salmon, 1 lb. of fresh frozen halibut, and 1 lb. of Nova lox. (6-8 oz vacuum sealed portions)  #2008 (6 lb) -$94.74 (HOLY CRAP!!! They sent me two of these buggers)  SO - it is about that time book club readers - make your final book notes and lets finalize the date - we are having a seafood extravaganza. I am interested to see what you all think of the book! And by the way - who knows how to cook or prepare the above goodies??  Here are pics of the package that arrived in the mail at work~  The box itself:     Fun stickers identifying contents:      All the fun fish info:    and of course all the contents:

        Self Discovery     I went to a creative marketing conference this past week. I found the reason why I have spent large portions of my life struggling to find my  ONE  thing. The one thing that will serve to define me as a person. The moderator clicked the powerpoint slide and up came these words...    "Creative people are GENERALISTS"    at first I laughed and thought of the  urlLink generalists website . Then it struck me - I may never have a ONE thing - other then being a creative type. I may spend so much time dabbling in a variety of different areas that I may never truly develop a taste for one particular area. I have difficulty in finishing tasks - because I am already off thinking of the next one I can create.  Stick with me while I weigh the pros and cons of my new found discovery... and find ways to harness my new knowledge.

        Adventures in Cake Decor     One or two birthday's ago I promised the sister in law that we would persue our cake decorating educations. While here we are still in pre-k. When will our schedules ever fall in line so we can learn how to spice things up with frosting?  A few weeks ago I posted a question... Is it possible to truly self teach yourself on subject matter - enough to reach some sort of class equivalent level (i.e. MBA or in this instance Wilton Cake Decor Level 1 Course Completion Certificate)   While before I head out on the long road to the home school MBA I thought I would test out my theory with the cake decorating. I assembled all my equipment and read through chapter one. The results were ... tasty...you be the judge on aesthetically pleasing.  Here are my thoughts so far: COURSE ONE COMPLETED... 1. More practice is necessary. 2. Cake frosting is extremely difficult to clean without LOTS of soap and HOT water. 3. Following the NEW WILTON frosting recipe yielded EXTREMELY delicious results (and I am not a frosting fan. The taste received rave reviews). 4. Dedicating time to sit and practice is tough to do! Something to overcome in order to achieve mastery levels.  THE PHOTOS: assembled tools    Frosting in the Kitchen Aid Mixer (did I mention how very much I love this thing??)    Testing out my hand (basically a trace board where you practice your frosting technique)    The final project for course one: Frosted Strawberry Cupcakes:    FINAL GOAL: To create these two pieces... Midterm: Fresh Raspberry Cake   Final Project: Reduplicate My Wedding Cake (compliments of Martha Stewart)    Grapevine Cake This grape-themed cake is frosted with buttercream the color of antique linenÃ&#151;shapes and textures reminiscent of the Tuscan countryside. Real grape leaves were used to mold the chocolate ones sprouting from the tiers of this cake, but any smooth nonpoisonous leaf can be used. Caramel-coated grapes and caramel "tendrils" complete the theme.

        It's What Day?     Well the alarm rang this morning - while dreaming I smugly thought "That alarm is not for me ... it is Saturday afterall". Much to my dismay it went off again - and the hubby confired it was only Thursday - UGH. Which in essence is not all bad...it is little Friday!  I once read a  urlLink blog  that refered to people who have parties on thursday's as bad asses (you can be sure I am paraphrasing here). Considering one would have to wake and report to work the next am - and function...  Is it a sign of being old if you are in awe of those who can party it up on a Thursday night?

        A Night On The Hill     A trip to the southern portion of the county had me longing to sing old McDonald - but in a cosmopolitan farmer sort of way. You see I have always loved the outdoors. Any chance I could have to spend time away from the city and out in fresh air was welcome.   I have never minded neighbors - nor the fact that they lived close enough for me to hear their phone ring. But I have begun to think that if they were a short stroll down a dirt path with fresh fruit in hand - that wouldn't be so bad. Certainly not as bad as not even knowing your city neighbors name.  I always thought I would be a city girl - and I know if I ever leave it people will line up to give me the big I told ya so. Maybe they knew better then me all along.   So back to my thoughts of Dayna's roadside stand, the Victorian farm house, the great pumpkin empire, and looking cute with dirt under the nails.  E-I-E-I-O

        Self Discovery II     So I have posted before about being a generalist. This past Friday I had an opportunity for some more self discovery with the help of some Wild Turkey. Now the weekend started innocently enough. We would get together with some friends, have a lovely meal and unwind and catch-up...of course while enjoying a few libations. Well the "few" libations turned into a "few" shots and much talking and dancing. I am pretty sure that mad jack and I even discussed some art.  anyway the point of posting all of this is to bring up our conversation on WHO IS DAYNA? I was without a concise and clear answer... General thoughts were all I could seem to come up with.  So I have spent a good portion of the rest of the weekend trying to come up with a more concrete definition of who I am.   Funny thing is that after really thinking about the answer - I realize that I may have some work to do in order to become the person I am.  more to come on this...

        Original Thought    Original thought is almost an oxy-moron. I find it harder and harder to determine whether ideas I formulate are my own or some conglomeration of many tidbits of info stored in my brain.  Recently I entered a craft swap where the theme was aprons. You were giving another swappers name and some background info and you were to create an apron specifically for that person. In return someone else will send an apron to you!  So I came up with what I am pretty sure was a bonofied Dayna original!! The denim overall converted to apron. Behold a completed project ("completed" = another amazing feat - may I mention done ahead of schedule!)  -Enjoy and feel free to take a tidbit of this project store it in your brain and use it later as your own -  Original Piece From Amvets = $2.50    Finished Piece:    I hope my swapee likes it!!

        "Ever Here of Pavlov?"    Well this post has been a while in the making...This one goes out to TIM!  A while ago while traveling in the car with my dear husband we got to talking about farming (remember my post about moving to the country). Now I am talking more about fancy farming - cosmopolitan country...I will get into this more later!  So while talking my husband recollects growing up on a grape farm and near cherry farms (or are the orchards??) Anyway in an attempt to scare birds away from the fruit an air cannon is used. Now for those not familiar an air cannon is a device set up in the fields that sends off a booming noise at pre-determined times (Each cannon consists of a propane gas bottle, where compressed air forced into a chamber is heated, then propelled through a plastic gun barrel with a loud pop that scares off nearby birds.  urlLink source )- this noise scares the birds right out of the fields.  ----follow me to a slight side story here---- Not only does this scare the bajeepers out of birds it also creates moments of panic in city girls who are "trespassing" on said property. My husband proposed to me in the grape fields behind his childhood home. HE had contacted the owner and gained permission - but I was unaware...So while we are roaming the rows of grapes the dang cannon shoots off and all I can imagine is an angry farmer standing on his front porch with a shot-gun firing off a warning round! Ahh yes my first experience with an air cannon...Green Acres here I come!! ----now back to our regularly scheduled program---  So....while in the car thinking about my crafty farm plans...I pondered the air cannon. I blurted "What a dumb idea" to which Tim looked at me baffled. I said don't the birds just get conditioned to the sound or timing of the cannon? It just can't be that effective of a method to get rid of birds. He disagreed and challenged me to prove it. I thought by mentioning good ole Pavlov that the entire subject would be moot. But alas here is some hard evidence to support my claim!  From our good friends at  urlLink Animal Planet :  Traditional methods to frighten birds from runways, such as firing cannons or disseminating bird distress signals along the runway, are often ineffective because the birds eventually become immune to the sounds.   Get a look at some of the  urlLink devices  that create "Scare Zones" for birds.  ahh sweet victory!

        Mammalian Truths     Over the holiday weekend I stumbled into a mammal conversation. It just so happened that a lactation nurse was on hand for this lively discussion. As a group we were trying to decide if any of us had ever seen a momma whale nursing a baby whale. Once it was a greed that no one had - we set out to see if whales nursed at all.   The results are in...  "Whale mothers have breasts and nipples, but baby whales cannot move their lips and so cannot suckle. When it is feeding time, the mother ejects her milk (which is the consistency of sour cream), the baby then drinks it out of the water."  source:http://www.breastfeeding.com/reading_room/test_iq.html  or are they????  this comes from the sea world website:   "Calves nurse below water, close to the surface.  The mother glides in a horizontal position with her tail arched, and the calf swims on its side with its mouth on the right or left mammary gland. To nurse, a calf swims on its side and suckles from nipples concealed in abdominal mammary slits."    Another philosophical drinking mystery still undetermined!

        The Good Ole Days     Gone are the days of having the Cleavers as your neighbors. I always wanted to get to know my neighbors - considering we live so close I can hear their phone ring and smell their pancake breakfasts. I was always a little sad when I didn't get to talk to new people...  Last night I came out to my car to find the neighbor (of 10 years) called the cops because I was parked on the wrong side of the street for over 20 minutes (mind you I was loading and unloading). I tried to explain that I was loading and leaving but that was not good enough she proclaimed. She yelled at me about how my car being parked where it was made it difficult to get her truck into her driveway - to which I retorted..."Maybe it's the beer that makes it tough to drive" as her drunk husband ambled towards me -open can in hand.  I will now go back to being happy to have quite keep to themselves neighbors. Bring on my knight on a shining John Deer - I need a driveway and some acres distance between the next house!

        Marketeers Making A Difference     In continuing the theme of things I love...Let's get into my field of study MARKETING/ADVERTISING. Here are some companies that I am loving for their creative approach. They took products that were ordinary and found ways to make them extraordinary and at the same time charge a premium price for something unique. I am always looking for more examples...do you know a company or product that is being marketed in a way you like? We can all think of campaigns that are annoying - or that appear in places we once thought were "sacred" (I don't mean in the biblical sense here)...tell me about the good stuff!!  Here are a few of the ones I appreciate:     urlLink www.dittie.com  Feminine hygiene products with real style. Uses online games, cleaver slogans on packaging, great illustrations...and more " to develop a new brand of feminine protection that didn't look at a woman's cycle as an ailment"  Go and play the bowling game to win a sample pack! "It's Kicking Taboos"     urlLink www.pomwonderful.com  Ok pomegranates have been around for almost all of time...now with a shapely bottle - the juice is NEW again! Great play on the many health benefits.  and to round off my marketing hat trick...     urlLink www.methodhome.com  Two college friends team up with famous packaging designer and along comes the most stylish cleaners you have ever seen. The extra bonus is they are environmentally safe and smell great! Their philosophy is based on the desire for house cleaning to not be such a chore! Move over boring harsh chemical cleaners - there is a new method to this house wife's madness.  -ENJOY!

        A Visual Oxymoron     Does this thought make anyone else laugh a little bit?    This is an illustration for to stake a sapling. Where I live there is a small park like setting where they just planted a whole bunch of new trees. The saplings are all staked off. The part that makes me laugh is that the saplings are staked off with pieces of wood. What a funny idea to cut down trees to make stakes to then tie new trees to. Now I do realize that there is some logical explanation...But I prefer to enjoy the visual oxymoron of it all if you will!  Now here is a  urlLink guy  that has the tree business all figured out!

        Much Like Oprah's Fav's...     Everyone is always curious what thing Oprah loves. Well today I had a request to post some of what I love.  Here are some sites I visit with some frequency:  (and for the four of you who read my blog - you already have found one another so they are not posted below...but know that I do send my love on a daily basis)   urlLink The amateur Gourmet  - Great cooking blog with lots of fun editorial and photos! Atkins lovers - Be forewarned - Recipes may contain ingredients which can be deemed offensive.   urlLink Not Martha  - A crafty site minus all fraudulent investment strategies. Besides being a great site - the author and I share a birthdate and an aversion to flip-flops with the little piece that goes between your toes - slip ons only please (see her side piece on flip flops  urlLink here  a consumer reports style piece on alternative summer footwear!)   urlLink Halley's Comment  - A business woman's take on things. Daily observations and interesting takes on common subjects - with a slant towards the business world, mothering, and love! And if you enjoy this - even a little bit check out the online blog magazine she writes for:  urlLink WORTHWHILE  ... brings up daily discussions from a group of bloggers that co-create discussions on the work place (mostly) and living the good life.   urlLink My Urban Dig  - a photo a day of some sort of random object with description. All objects are part of the authors personal collection on display for your enjoyment. I urge you to check it out just once...it is addictive. A sort of virtual serach through someones drawers - of course minus all the bad things that statement might imply! I am never disapointed! For more info on the site check out the "Huh, what is this section"  ok - that is all for today...more to come! Let me know what you think of them...or feel free to leave me one of your favorite places!

        1 + 1 =?     We begin today with some simple math for the masses: Let's all go back to the day of proofs.  Let Us Assume That:  1. People Who Steal Are Mean 2. All Mean People Suck   Therefore we can deduce that the varmint that stole my gmail account overnight  SUCKS .  Lesson concluded - there shall be a quiz on Monday :)   *Note if by reading this post you feel overwhelmed with grief and sadness for me fear not. A lovely person has sent me an invitation and I have the proper authorities in hot pursuit of the crook.

        KUDOS - Before They Were Snacks     Today I offer up Kudos to Budweiser's Agency of Record for creating the Real Men of Genius Spot - entitled: Mr. Over The Top Carb Counter. Although I couldn't find the actual (or entire for that matter) text of the radio spot...here is a summary of the original which had me giggling all the way to work. To all my fellow carb cravers I give you MR OVER THE TOP CARB COUNTER - We Salute You:  P.S. Kudos to any readers who can find the actual text of the spot for me :)  Today we salute you, Mr. Over the Top Carb Counter.  (...Despite the pressures of a career and family, you chose your number one priority to be counting carbs  Brushing aside such things as friends and family, you meticulously count every single carb hoping that in the end it all adds up to your target number... Zero.  Did that artichoke have 13.5 or 13.6 grams of carbs? Better look it up while you crack open another pound of bacon.  You know that the next best thing to meat and potatoes is meat and meat. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ While searching for the above radio spot I came across eGullet posting boards where chatters were carrying on about all of the finer qualities of bacon. I found this one posted by ALIKAT to be most wonderful!! I have bolded my most favorite parts!!   "Who can forget this showstopper from The Sound of Breakfast:  Raindrops on bacon And bacon on kittens Bright crispy bacon  And  warm bacon mittens  Brown bacon packages tied up with strings Bacon is one of my favorite things  Girls in white dresses with  pink bacon sashes   Bacon grease smeared On my nose and eyelashes  Silvery bacon that melts in the pan I must eat bacon whenever I can  When the dog eats All my bacon And I'm feeling sad I simply remember There's more in the fridge And then I don't feeeeel Soooooo baaaaaaaaaaaaad!"    For the original post and more talk of Bacon poems and songs click  urlLink here .  **Side note  If you are busily counting carbs or calories or fat grams - STOP for a moment and laugh at the above. You can thank me later for all the beneficial  urlLink side effects !  GO BACON!

        Forever Young     Every now and again I love to get myself caught up in the world that children's minds and imaginations often occupy. The Harry Potter series has a great way of doing this for me. I love to forget about adult life for a while and be an uninhibited thinker - even if for just a bit. (check out author  urlLink J.K. Rowlings  new site!)  This past week my younger sister turned 13. Despite all the other teen type influences my sister remains a free spirit of sorts. She avoids all that is girly and "grown-up" she knows how to have fun! She has a great way with humor and uses it very well. I love watching her consume all of life's offerings.   Birthdays always provide me with some sort of stress as I try to find the "perfect" gift - especially for my siblings. My husband came up with the great idea of a Venus Fly Trap Plant. I purchased one here: plantsforkids.com  Playing up on childhood imagination I thought about the excitement of a carnivorous plant and came up with this packaging:        It was a hit...She saw the writing and didn't last two presents before getting up to hand selecting the stamp labeled package. I smiled - gift giving success was mine - curiosity and wonderment achieved!  Happy Birthday Britt!

        Online Rorschach Ink Blot Test        The fine folks at Tickle.com have now prepared an ink blot test. Find out about your personality through this semi short  urlLink ink blot test .   What Is Your Subconcious Mind Driven By?  ***~~~~~~~~***~~~~~~~~***~~~~~~~~***~~~~~~~~***~~~~~~~~  My Results: My subconscious mind is driven most by  Kindness    This means you have a deep desire to be kind and fair to others. You may even be preoccupied with finding kindness in the world around you, far more than you realize on a conscious level.   It is possible that the underlying reason you seek kindness in the world around you, is that you fear cruelty, the opposite of kindness. That could drive you to unconsciously project kindness wherever possible into your world. Regardless of its origin, your steadfast adherence to being kind to others is felt by people you are close to.   You are probably more susceptible than others to being overwhelmed by emotions — both yours and others'. It is possible that your unusually empathic nature is a result of your natural sensitivity to others' pain, and your desire to help them avoid it. For this reason, things might affect you more than they affect your friends and family. To protect yourself from too much emotional intensity, you might want to keep an eye out so you can recognize it when it starts. That will allow you to slow things down until you feel grounded again.   Overall, your strong orientation towards kindness gives you an optimistic nature, which translates into you seeing the best in the people around you. Because you're not one to be overly judgmental, others may seek out your company when they need a friend to talk to. People close to you likely know that you care deeply about the inner lives of others and can listen to what they have to say without imposing your views on them.

        A "Potpourri"     1. When you are moving and you don't properly pack hangers:   You end up with either a box of hangers at the trash ala my new neighbors or an angry husband who stares at said barrel of monkey hanger pile wondering when will the madness end?  2. I was driving around wondering just how long will we be keeping flags at half staff in honor of former president Reagan? Well no need to fret over such a question - just consult the  urlLink flag code  established by Congress in 1942. Which will let you know that the flag will fly for 30 days in honor of a past president.  3. Here is a great website with some really unique artsy piece for sale... urlLink Thorsten Van Elten .

        "Pop Goes The Toaster"     I have had quite a run in with appliances today. I started the morning by rifling through a rubbermaid of "summer" clothes. I am pretty sure I pulled out the dress with the most wrinkles. While ironing all the water leaked out of the crack that has appeared in our year and a half old iron. I checked the manufacturers site - good to know they cover repairs on all products less then 100 days old! So off to work in a freshly wet ironed dress.  Any recommendations on an Iron you LOVE!?  *Note to self clean puddle on carpet below puddle on ironing board.  I have the afternoon munchies so I decided to make an English  muffin with peanut butter. WHY do I insist on watching the last seconds of the toasting process? It seems like forever and I ALWAYS jump when the toaster oven dings - as if in 25 years of making toast it is just the darndest surprise every time. Which leads me to think... Why don't they make a Jack In The Box Toaster?

        A Penny Saved Is Sometimes Just Cheap     Frugal is definitely a word I have at times used to describe myself. I use it sparingly because of its at times negative connotation. Ultimately I find nothing wrong with trying to save a little here or there.   I had to laugh this past weekend as I was reading an article entitled "Re-serving a birthday cake and other penny-pinching tales". The article by Michelle Singletary goes on to tell the tale of contestants who entered their frugal tips to the authors annual "Penny Pincher of The Year" contest.  As one can imagine by the articles title the author describes her own money saving tactics at her son and husbands recent birthdays. Lucky for her wallet the husband and son have the same first name. So instead of buying two cakes this year she purchased on sheet cake and urged her husband not to cut the part that read "Happy Birthday Kevin" she then froze that half and pulled it out later for her son's 6th birthday. She claims he was thrilled just to have a cake with his name on it. Even deeming it his "Best Birthday EVER"  The article named the top three winners. Each received a monetary prize and a t-shirt.   Third Place  goes to the woman whose husband in an effort to save $7 only replaced one of his wiperblades. His rationale was that the passenger seat is empty most times.   Second Place  is held by the frugal mom who tried to invent her own sports drink for her athletically inclined daughters. Her secret recipe: Kool-Aid, water, salt, and sugar. (Correct me if I am wrong - but isn't that just the regular Kool-Aid recipe plus SALT?? I was not aware of the magical replenishing nature of salt)   First Place  was awarded to the cheap husband who refused to take the quicker toll-road to the hospital while his wife was in the passenger seat in labor. So how much did he save by going regular roads...A whopping $2. Thankfully his wife can now laugh about it and even appreciates all the money this penny-pinching dad has saved their new family!

        Adult Food & First Loves     A photo of Wonder Woman flashed across the screen the other night and my husband was smitten. I saw his eyes glaze over as he rehashed his childhood love affair with the lasso brandishing beauty. It got me to thinking of my own first crush. I had my first experience with infatuation after watching Stand By Me. I was pretty sure I was going to marry  urlLink Wil Wheaton . He was sensible, a leader, a little nerdy, he was fair to the whole gang, and he was just cute!   In essence I did marry Wil (does anyone see the resemblance). So did my hubby get his very own Lynda Carter? To Be Determined...Kind of interesting that both of our crushes initials were W.W.  As a childhood side note. I grew up in a household that didn't have much money for discretionary spending. One time at the grocery store Tim and I were walking through the isles and I started to drool over drumstick ice cream cones. I told him how they were "Adult" food in our house. Us kids got the no-name knock offs. Pepperidge Farms Milano cookies also fit in this boat of off-limits food. Tim laughed and was amazed that we had separate snacks for adults and kids. I kind of like the idea. The forbidden food is such a treat for me to enjoy now. How about your houses - did you have off limits food or were my parents just stingy? :)

        If I Had 290 Million Dollars     Last night the hubby and I consumed a generous gift of anniversary champagne. We were celebrating the one year anniversary of our business! The chilled bubbly was delish! A brief moment of praise to my husband for all that he has accomplished in one years time.  ~~~~~~......~~~~~~......~~~~~~...... I am more proud then I can express. You set out to do something many people in this country only get to dream of doing. Your actions are deliberate and conscientious. You are knowledgeable and caring. People can sense your genuine nature. I am forever grateful that you have taken me along on this journey. Here is to many more years of goal setting!(baring we don't win the lotto tonight)  ~~~~~~......~~~~~~......~~~~~~......  sooo...  after a bottle of champagne we got to thinking about this lotto thing and I spent some time amusing myself with some of the irregular type things I could do with the money - which by the way has been raised to 290Million now. Here were my ideas:  1. I would pay the NY Times to NOT run their crossword puzzle for one week. In order to receive the money they would also have to deny that they ever had a crossword puzzle when people called in perplexed.  2. I would pay members of the WWE to give me wrestling lessons.  3. I would give friends and family a chance at their own personal endowment by way of my favorite game show LETS MAKE A DEAL. I would even buy the old set to stage the event. Relatives would approach the stage and have to pick what was behind door number 1...2...or 3 or course their would be zany side offers!! One door would contain the cash another a crazy lavish gift chosen by me specifically for them and the third...Livestock of course!  4. I would write a book and not sell it...I would print it and then distribute all the copied through bookcrossing.com  If you have any other ideas feel free to suggest them now - because when I win that kitty tonight I am chartering a plane outta town for a little bit!

        Great Work If You Can Get It     Should money be no object here are a list of business ideas that I would like to pursue.  1. Giant Pumpkin Patch & Roadside Fruit Emporium 2. Day Spa 3. Camp Ground  4. Bed and Breakfast 5. Book Store 6. Photography Studio 7. Restaurant - something small and cozy with a unique specialty  I think that all of these options would give me that "I love what I do feeling". What would do it for you? What would be the perfect work situation?

        I Antied Up The Dollar Now Here Is My Dream     The pot has reached $280 million dollars. Raise your hand if you too have problems with completely fathoming that sum of money. The collection went around the office and now 16 of us wait in baited breath for our "lucky" numbers to be called in on Friday!  So what would I do with the money...WoW Where to start!!  My latest and greatest idea is to purchase the waterfront property in town and revamp this city. Then sit back and make the money that the city should have been making for years. First I would have to remove the toxic waste...but after that :)

        Smell      Chopping up fresh herbs and vegtables is so addicting. I love to have a yummy smell tucked away faintly in the fold of lines on my hands. Today it is a distant garlic deliciousness. Occassionally it is a hint of rosemary sprigs or the earthly sexiness of a tomato plant.    ummmmm summer....    other strange smells that I love...    Skunks  Gas  Clothes that have campfire lingering  Static Electric Air

        And We Wait...     Once in college I helped a friend and participated in a brain wave study. My friend applied small goo filled receptors to points on my scalp. Once secured I was put through a variety of mental challenges with visual and audio stimulation. All the while I was instructed to move as little as possible. After the test I was told that I was the most still and patient person to have come through the lab.    Last weekend I stood by a fence post for three hours straight. I was directing traffic. During my three hour shift a total of 7 cars drove by - note that three of the cars drove past me twice! Now granted I was bored - but I occupied myself and made it though without much trouble.    so why is it (if I have been blessed with all this patience) that 47 seconds in line at the DMV has me fidgiting like I sat on an ant hill? While in line today I must have looked at my watch 15 times - and that was just in the first 3 minutes. I counted heads of people in front trying to estimate my wait time. I smiled nicely at the clerks who were delighted to be taking their sweet old time. I tried counting in my head. I was internally yelling at people who didn't mve up to the open wondow quick enough.    I actually developed a stomach ache waiting to be told that my paperwork was insuffecient. What is it about the DMV?

        "Hi Sam - How are you?"   Did you ever notice how much idle chatter fills the air? Ever take a moment and realize the amount of banal converstations you partake in? There is one gentelman who I encounter on an almost daily basis. Our conversations (if you can call them that) are always upbeat and exude friendliness. However this is the repetitious script...    me:  "Hi Sam - How are ya today?"   * note that on occasion I switch it up with a  "how are things?"     sam:  "going well thank you"      to get the true feel repeat daily for about a year!    So hear is the deal...     I realize I know just next to nothing about someone who has an almost daily role in my life and I am disturbed by that! I propose that I will stop asking how sam is doing. In no lengthy terms - does anyone who asks really mean it anyways? Especially for someone you know little about. From this day forward I will now great Sam and direct a question his way. Of course I will explain my reasoning for the new greeting - I am hopefully he does not recoil in fear that I have become an interrogator!    Today I kicked things off - and learned that Sam will be on vacation for about two weeks. This is the perfect amount of time for me to start drafting my easy a.m. questions. I will be raring to go next time we shall meet!     Feel free to drop me a question or two - I am taking requests!    Some more inspiration to meet the people in your life:  From:  urlLink http://www.inspirationpeak.com/shortstories.html#Cleaning%20Lady                          The Cleaning Lady                      During my second month of nursing school, our               professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and               had breezed through the questions, until I read the last one:               "What is the first name of the woman who cleans the               school?" Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the               cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her               50s, but how would I know her name?  I handed in my paper,               leaving the last question blank. Before class ended, one student               asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.                "Absolutely," said the professor. "In your careers               you will meet many people. All are                significant.  They deserve your attention and care, even if               all you do is smile and say  'Hello'."                                I've never forgotten that lesson.  I also learned her name               was Dorothy.                         ~ Joanne C. Jones

        Back & Better For Having Been Gone     The weekend has past but the memories will remain. Many new discoveries were made at this years festival. Without sounding cliche - it was a vacation of great music, super food, amazing conversation and some of the finest people I would care to spend my free time with! I would elaborate more but quite frankly I like being stingy with my thoughts of the long weekend. For one it is too hard to recreate in words and secondly once I do I feel further removed from the original experience.  One Story To Share...  One point over the weekend I had come back from the outhouses and was a little bit irked that people had taken marker to the walls. The entire inside of the stall had been coated in permanent marker. None of the text was of value (mostly swear words and scribbles). When I returned back to the campsite I relayed my disappointment. I was amazed to hear a friend question why I had a problem with the whole thing. Long after the conversation had moved on I still was trying to think of reasons why someone wouldn't mind bathroom graffiti...that was until yesterday morning. Now I am not saying that the following info is the reason my friend took his point of view...I am merely using it as an example.  Yesterday morning I opened my inbox to an industry newsletter entitled STREET ART. The purpose of the piece was to talk about the increasing trend of artists fighting advertisers for public space. At what level is it ok for an advertiser to use up public space to display a message and not ok for individuals? The ahh-ha moment came for me in the quote from Marc Shiller as reported in Reveries Magazine. "Why is the ad I see in the Gap any more acceptable than any art that I hang on a public lamppost?" What defines one as right and the other as wrong?   We can't base the right or wrong on the content of the message. Some would find the ad below to be just as offensive as the words "John go F*%K yourself and crawl back under the rock you came from" scrawled out in black ink.    Weigh in with your opinion. What dictates fair use of public space in your mind? Does everyone have the Riga to express themselves in a public venue or just those who pay for the ad space?  While you are thinking about it...check out some really great street art. Art can range from simple painted stickers on lamp posts to elaborate silk screen techniques, lithography and even pieces that involve ceramics.   TAKE A LOOK   Marc Shiller (quoted above) hosts a site called  urlLink  Wooster Collective  . An online collection of some amazing examples of street art. Well worth a quick look.    urlLink Swoon  a street artist spends up to two weeks at times creating giant cut-outs to paste on walls around NYC.   urlLink Dave  this website features a great variety of the artists fun vibrant pieces.

        Enjoy Life      This week has delivered to me the message that life is to precious to waste.    This week I have watched one funeral procession, attended one wake, will be attending one funeral, and watched very sad new get delivered. None of these events were related to one another.    I sit here reading the 9-11 Report and the horror of that day is coming back to me.     Life is as the cliche describes it...too short to waste.          Don't forgot to tackle some of those "someday" ideas!      Tell someone you love them!      Enjoy the simple things.    Recently I visited the Lance Armstrong Foundation's  urlLink website     I made a donation to the foundation by purchasing 10 LIVESTRONG bracelets.        I love the message.     I have a few more...  Do you want one? Drop me a line!

        Farmers Market      This weekend I ventured to the local Farmer's Market. I had a great time looking at all the rows of fresh homegrown produce. I also got to spend some time reminiscing about the many many Saturdays I spent at the Market with my grandma and grandpa. I got all kinds of goodies for $9.50    Corn, Hot Peppers, Mustard, Kosher Salt, Bacon Dip, Two Bell Peppers, Peppercorns, and Garlic.       The primary reson for the trip was to pick up 3-4 pounds of hot peppers so I could make a pack of pickled peppers.        The canning went well...just counting down the days till I can open this can up and enjoy!     Thanks to Aunt Carroll and Dan for this recipe!

        On My Trip      After lunch today I took a small trip to the post office. I turned left at a stop light and ended up behind a yellow Cavalier. I looked down at the licence plate...   SXXXYMAN   Talk about a "vanity" plate.  I can't imagine this would increase your date night options. I could be wrong though - maybe the driver isn't vain but is in the adult entertainment industry - there are three X's after all... hmmmm.

        Things to See While Your Here      Welcome to the world wide web I will be your tour guide today. I would now like to point your attention to two sites.    1. Have you ever visited Amazon.com? Have you seen how guests can use listmania to create a list of products? Well you can!! Some people make lists of their favorite young adult books, best books on history, top 10 funniest books etc... Check this one out - the list is entitled " urlLink So You're Going To Jail " . I heard Martha Stewart say she was looking for a good guide - perhaps she will find the link here!    2. Let me help you be the office hero! How you wonder? Most companies want to know an excellent way in which they can save money. The secret is in the miracle of printer inks and toner. Visit  urlLink LaserMonks   - yes they are real monks and the make money to use for charity and the likes by manufacturing and selling printer ink. You wont even believe the discount. There was a $7 difference in the price of my printers black ink (compare Laser Monks and Office Depot). They even offer a recycling program for empty print cartridges. Not in the market for ink? You can still visit their site and make a prayer request (see the right hand side towards bottom of page) or listen to some Gregorian Chants. I have also heard that the occasional shipment that leaves their facility comes with a handwritten note from a monk. GREAT MARKETING - they have all the right parts to make this work for them. Spread the word!    I hope you enjoyed your tour - I will now open it up for any questions....yes, you in the back?

        Fun Photo Talent      I came across Audrey Heller's website (though some link this a.m. that I can't recall...). She is a photographer that specializes in everyday objects that have a Honey I Shrunk The Kid's type of feel. I have often wondered what it would be like if humans were more on the size scale of ants.     Here is a teaser photo of her work...now go see the rest!!

        Hopes For You...      I hope that at one time in your life you own the most perfect vehicle for going to the drive in movies.     I hope that you can someday stop and recall an event from your past by a faint smell carried in the wind.    I hope that one day you can laugh so very hard that you think you may just never have this much fun again - but then your wrong and you do it again and again.    I hope that at some point in time you reconnect with the adventurer of your youth and dare to attempt the impossible just for the wonder of it all.    I hope that in the future you wake up every morning and do something you love.    I hope that you can look up at the stars or out at the ocean and realize the miracle of your existence.

        Slimming Down      I am a stuff accumulator - as we have all seen with the GREAT DELEATION photos. I think part of the problem stems from me not liking change too much. I have issues parting with things. The worst part of that being that they are indeed just "things". I have a horrible attachment to inanimate objects. I have even been known on occasion to attach human like qualities to objects - yes, the first step to recovery is admitting the problem.    Once upon a time ago I received the ugliest card in the mail. Upon opening it I realized that my aunt had mailed it to me because she knew that I would have been sad for this card. Sad that because it was soo ugly no one would buy it...so she figured it was better off "living " with me. BAH - when will the madness end?    not any time soon....apparently Toyota is working on a car that can express emotions to other drivers. The article doesn't state if the prototype has a middle finger option.         25 years worth of stuff has been accumulated in a variety of rubbermaid containers and I debate what to do with it all. I have decided that I would like to live a little more minimally. I wish that I had the guts (or at least interesting enough "stuff") to do what  urlLink John Freyer  did.    (excerpt from www.allmylifeforsale.com)   Welcome                                  to Allmylifeforsale, an online project that explored                                  our relationship to the objects around us, their                                  role in the concept of identity, as well as the                                  emerging commercial systems of the Internet. Using                                  the public/commercial space of the online trading                                  community  urlLink Ebay                                   in conjunction with his online catalogue Allmylifeforsale.com,                                  John Freyer catalogued and sold nearly everything                                  that he owned, from his kitchen cutlery to his                                  personal hygiene products, his Star Wars sheets                                  and finally even the domain name Allmylifeforsale.com                                  itself.     The best part being that he offered to try and visit the people who bought things from him while he traveled around with the money he made. He even got people to buy his old electrical bills.    My focus for the next little bit will be to create ways to live more streamlined. I will need to get over the following fears:    1. I will someday be unprepared because I got rid of XYZ ITEM  2. Just when I get rid of XYZ PRODUCT I will have come up with a new purpose/need for the thing.  3.  As a result of Fear 2 I will now have to spend more money to buy the same or a similar XYZ type items to fill said purpose/need.    words of encouragement or suggestions on  deleting  more crap from my life??

        Has Me Laughing    I read these first couple paragraphs on an  urlLink E-Lifestyle site  and had to laugh at two parts. The article was titled Who Wants To Marry Tom Cruise. Has he fallen in anyone elses ranks ... or just mine?         As his newest flick, Collateral, is about to hit the screens, Hollywood megastar  Tom Cruise confesses that he's on the lookout for another wife.    Despite two failed marriage and a recent breakup with longtime gal pal Penelope Cruz, Cruise says he's ready to fall in love again.  ' I will never be down with love. Ever. I’m the guy who loves relationships. I love women, ' he told the Daily Mirror. 'I’m the guy who’s going to get married again. I’m not going to give up on that. I really love that kind of friendship and intimacy.'

        Incredible News!!    I just got a call from my hubby (on my new cell phone which rings to the old favorite SMURF theme) and I was alerted to the fact that we are getting......             T - I - V - O!!!  This is one of those things that I have wanted for a long time but since we didn't have cable it wasn't really necessary...I mean I have already seen every possible Seinfeld, Simpsons, and Will and Grace on reruns not to mention Antiques Roadshow.  Sure I would love to get a cuisenart food processor - but I can wait...I will now feast on TV goodness. I can tape every dumb show imaginable!  I will save the entire season of the OC to watch whenever I feel like...not to mention the wedding story and all kinds of chick crap on TLC and Lifetime! Watch out FoodNetwork here I come!  oh YIPIEE!!!

        Advertising    Saw two ads and a spoof today that caught my attention and made me laugh. The first - two ads for vacuums (Rowenta and Electrolux) both seen on the ad-rag.com - They are worth a peak...good creative use of outdoor advertising. See them  urlLink here .  The spoof is  urlLink Will Ferrell  doing a George Bush political commercial. Worth a look - I got a few laughs out of it. It is along the lines of a Satuday Night Live sketch.  -Enjoy (both pieces found on adrants.com)
