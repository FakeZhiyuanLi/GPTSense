      All alone, or in two's, The ones who really love you Walk up and down outside the wall. Some hand in hand And some gathered together in bands. The bleeding hearts and artists  Make their stand.  And when they've given you their all Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall.  -pink floyd

      Its so simple and complicated the way you can crush me No matter how much this hurts This is through I get as far as your door before I get caught I make up excuses just to touch you and I can't stop, I can't stop So are we playing for keeps These days begin and they don't end for weeks Leave me left out of anything to do with you Excuse me while I fall apart don't flatter yourself sweetheart Let me take the wheel and I'll crash this car Do you have to make this So hard Your so good At pretending everything is alright Your as welcome as cancer but my door is always unlocked

      so ive come to a conclusion... friends arent people your suppose to compare yourself to and try n compete with... your friends are suppose to be the total opposite of that. like u can have a friend who hates your music... or the way you dress or doesnt beleive in the same things as u... but as long as you respect each others ways... your still friends... im not saying you cant have things in common... i mean hello... theres obviously something that brings you together... like theyre still always the friends who r into the same shit as u... but thats not whats always important... and the relationships between people change throughout the years... like one year ur inseperable and the next you see each other about once a week. but that doesnt mean that you dont care about those people.... and if they are your real friends... they should be there for you no matter what... whether your crisis is a broken nail or a broken heart!.... you should be able to trust that person.... that doesnt mean they have to know every fact about u... and you dont necessarily have to be on good terms 24/7... like some of your best friends can be the people u hate at times! and sometimes people need space... and sometimes friends do things towards their friends that they do regret... and if your going to say sorry for something you did.... you should actually be sorry!... and now i have to piss....
