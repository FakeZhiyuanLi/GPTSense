      So I put my rose from grad in a vase, even though I'm going away today, and when I come back it'll be dead. I'm not sure why I bothered. I guess to preserve the memories attatched to it that I want to remember...yet I'm also tempted to tear it up.

      School is officially over and I'm supposed to be happy, but I'm not...because I am once again confused about N.P. He was all nice and everything during grad and I was so tempted to ask him out. SO tempted, but the practical part of me made me stop myself, because I knew that he'd probably say no. I doubt he's interested in me in THAT way, because there are hundreds of other prettier girls in the school that he could have...Well, In that statement I'm kinda assuming unfairly that he is shallow enough to care that much about looks, but still... I'm disappointed at the prospect of a long summer without him, but I guess I'll have to move on, and keep going without him. I hate this SO much. I can't even explain how I feel. I guess heartbroken and utterly disappointed. I realise that I'm really dramatic and emotionally intense so I'm probably making everything 20 times worse for myself, but I can't handle this...

      I'm so pissed for 1,000's of reasons but I think I'll just write about the least important ones. First off: Virgin Records sucks serious butt. They don't carry the Jinxed CD called Beyond the Obvious or any Fall Out Boy stuff, so now I have to pay $40.00 to order each specially. It's not my fault that all the best bands are signed to small record labels and are not particularly popular, so why do I have to pay extra because of it? Life sucks... Anywho, tomorrow is grad. I should probably go off and waste my time removing my turquoise nail polish, but I'd really rather not...

      It's the last day of school and I threw out all of the assignments that I spent countless hours perfecting...it kinda felt like I was throwing the whole year away...I guess I was throwing Elementary School away, Wasn't I??? Next year means highschool, which is good, and I'm stoked about that but, in the short term all I have to look forward to is summer, and in actuality I'm dreading it...I'm going to go insane with boredom. I still have the biggest thing for N.P. but I guess it's a one sided thing. I'm used to that so I can live with it, it's just kinda disappointing because he created the illusion that there was something there. I want to be over him enough to kick his ass, but I'm not, and right now I seriously doubt I ever will be...

      I'm such an idealistic retard. I swear that all of that supposed "chemistry" between me and N.P. was my imagination...  Loss of Belief  I've wasted all of my time thinking of you I've been making you up to be more than you are There's nothing that sets you apart  You created the illusion that you cared and you made me believe you but no longer can you catch me in the web of lies that you've spun  Deceitful and insensitive tonight is the last night you'll ever see me again and you'll wonder why you ever left me behind  At least I don't have to feel anymore because your faults created the nightmare that we're living  tomorrow's too late you can never take back the words that you spoke to me that I can't forget...  -End-  I think the poem speaks for itself.

      Permeate Me (Random words! Hee hee!)  Clouds drift across the sky as we drift away and disappear no one will remember us anyways we'll slip into the (insert adjective here) surf completely unnoticed I'll swim among mermaids cling to dolphins and the only words you gave me I can only hope that they were true..  -Chorus- Lower the anchor hit the ocean floor strand us amid this abysmal blue with no escape  I sense the rocks beneath me in this deep blue dream slippery seaweed teases at my toes as I take in my surroundings I wonder, why you're not with me...  -Chorus-

      I haven't really seen N.P. since that day due to my being home sick, but I was thinking...would it be worse to ask him out and be turned down or live thinking of what could've been? I think the latter is worse, but it's what I'll probably end up doing cuz I'm so insufferably shy and screwed up...I feel like there's this major battle going on inside of me and I can't escape it no matter how I try. I'm seriously a really angry, emotionally intense person inside, and sometimes I scare myself...all of this has been totally apparent in my poetry and song lyrics that I've written and co-written with one of my friends lately. I wish I could just snuff this out like a candle or watch it fade quickly like a weak fire...I don't like being stuck in the purgatory of Indecision.  Have you noticed that everything is just one big analogy, and if it's overexplained and picked apart too much it loses it's splendor? Actually, I don't even get that...it was something that just suddenly formed in my head but what I'm trying to get at is that I wish I could stop analysing this situation, and linger in N.P's eyes...even though they won't last for ever. They'll burn out and I'll never see them again...oh God, I totally can't deal with that...I'm scared. I'm scared of myself, and what I'm feeling, and what I'm writing. I'm not in control of anything and that's seriously unnerving. It scares me that EVERYTHING that he seems to be doing that suggests he might possibly like me could all just be my imagination. Am I a romantic who's just totally desperate for this to begin? It scares me that I'm not in control of what I'm feeling I just have to go with the flow, and take risks, even though I've never been able to take them before...What's to say I'm ready to take a risk now??! There's so much at stake here and it frightens me that one decision could totally turn everything upside down. Why can't he just do all of this fucking thinking instead of me? Why am I pondering about this and Him constantly?? Why can't I forget? No matter how hard I try to distract myself, there's always someone who looks like him, only of course they'll never measure up to him...IS this an infatuation?? Am I in love?  Maybe I am, because I feel like I am...but see that's the thing, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?? I've always believed that we should leave some mystery in life and live without defining things of people, but right now I feel like I really just want to know so much stuff that I'll never find out...for example, how is he feeling about this whole thing? I bet he hasn't thought about it once...well, I'm thinking enough for both of us, aren't I? I'm getting exasperated...I went to this Grad dance thingy after school on Monday, and I passed him and he waved and yelled "Bye Emily!" and I can't even explain how I felt hearing his voice directed towards me...it was one of those little things that just makes you feel awesome. And I want more of those little moments with him...is that too much to ask for? I don't even need to date him...I just want to be with him sometimes. Right now that's the only thing I really want, but only, of course, if he wants it too. I wish I knew what he wanted because that would make this so much simpler. I'd rather know that he secretly hated me than not know anything at all...besides, that would make for some wicked emo songs...maybe I'll try to ask him discreetly about how he feels. I know I hardly know him, but the thing is if I don't move this whole thing along quickly nothing will come of all of this time spent thinking, or of my feelings...Maybe I'll ask him, and I'll be prepared for the worst, because emo will come of it, and writing an awesome song always seems to make everything alright...

      Irredeemable Me  Raindrops spill down the tinted glass blurring the line between reality and fantasy. I see a distorted reflection of myself in the water broken by ripples that begin to slip away and I imagine you beside me...  Can't you see that I'm spilling my heart into these pages?  When you speak I'm never quite sure what you mean are there hidden messages in your voice that rings out like the soft tone of churchbells?  I can't quite define what I'm feeling in words All I can say is that I'm drowning in this ceaseless storm and I'm drowning in the words you speak that I can't quite comprehend.

      Life always plays the strangest games...I was sorta listening to a lot of cheesy punk rock ( I Don't Wanna Know by NFG, Falling for you by the Starting Line, etc.), and wishing for something like that to happen in my life, and yesterday, I met someone...Wait, I should start from the beginning, shouldn't I? OK, so I was having a crappy day, and my teacher announced that we would be rehearsing for our graduation ceremony that takes place next Monday. Yesterday it was thirty-two degrees celsius and our school was totally boiling, so of course being cramped into the confines of the gym for an hour didn't sound exactly fun to me, or my fellow students. So, we're put in alphabetical order and I'm between a couple of French immersion (sp??!) guys that I've never actually met before. The staff ushers us into our seats, and I'm sitting at the very end of the row next to one of these guys, who I will from now on reffer to as N.P. (his anitials) The teachers were talking and I was just, you know...staring at the ceiling and wishing for it to end. All of the immersion guys wear their hair sort of like Jet and Rooney do, and N.P., who is not an exception to this whole hair thing, keeps shaking it out of his eyes and glancing over at me.The cynic that I am, I assumed that there was probably something on my face. For what other reason would he keep looking at me like that? He goes, "So, what's your name again?" I reply, "Em." "Ah, that explains the wristbands." And we talk a bit more and he seems genuinely....nice, you know? And I realised that I was sort of in "like" with him. He's actually really good looking and he has a really good sense of humour, and who can really help who they crush on anyways?  Further into the rehearsal I catch him staring at me again, and I laugh and smile because I don't really mind...  N.P: "You like to laugh, don't you?"  Me: "Life is funny."  And so rehearsal comes to a close, and by then I'm actually kind of wishing that the whole thing would just never end, although I have pretty much no idea what was going on there, and still don't. The thing that really sux is that, because he's in French immersion he is almost certainly going to transfer to a different school than me, which gives me all of four days to see him before summer begins, and I totally don't know what to do or what's going on...and I still can't figure any of this out.

      Check out the book revolutions on Canvas, published by Ad Astra books. I just read a couple of excellent exerpts, that were enough to convince me to buy it. I just need to find a book store that carries it, cuz my parents are super paranoid of buying stuff online! You can read some exerpts from it at http://www.adastrabooks.com/cover/excerpts/hello/hello.html  Have fun!

      I've been doing a lot of nothing lately. I found some new bands (well not new, but new to me) through alternative press and the internet and stuff, which is exciting! Other than that I've been burning up because it's so hot and humid here. I haven't really slept for a couple of nights because of this, so I'm kinda grumpy...Anywo, if you're passing by and you have a lot of time on your hands check out: Autopilot Off (although I'm sure all of you know them already. There isn't really an emo following here in Vancouver, so I find all of this out myself.) Small towns burn a little slower, Amber Pacific, Fall Out Boy, and Jinxed. Well, I must go now!

      (written at Gold Pan on the way back to Vancouver) It's very deserty here. There's this neverending chorus of crickets coming from a hill nearby that's kind of irritating, but it also reminds me of time spent in dingy hotels where crickets chirped endlessly all through the night. I travelled so much when I was little, and it's all sort of a blur. I really miss it though. Now all I do are these five hour drives back and forth to our cabin. I think I'd rather go to Europe...

      I'm out here sitting in the sun. My mom is continuing her constant narrative about life, the universe, and everything which is kind of annoying, thus I am zoning out and writing. My time spent here has been pretty good. I've been reading, writing, and listening to music a lot. I think I'm going to go canoeing and visit the ranch later, which is always fairly entertaining. I'll write later!  (Written later) So I'm standing here actually inside the abbandoned ranch. It smells a lot like mildew and cow crap in here, but I'm starting not to notice. All of the structures here are infested with bugs, and are the homes to swallows. (the kind of bird that tried to attack me 15 minutes ago!) They make their nests in the rafters, and sing constantly. Anyways, I'm in my favourite building. There are actually more windows than walls in here, and I have no idea as to what it's purpose was, but somehow it feels safer than the others. The other buildings give off these sort of creepy vibes; probably because people actually lived in them. It's like being in someone elses home uninvited. This one wasn't anyone's home, and I feel like I can almost call it mine.  Paragons  Indigo butterflies surround me they flit in and out of broken windows, portals into the past.  I stand among the ashes of someone's life my ears filled with the music of the birds that sing of days gone by when this house was filled with laughter and no one dared to scry in the mirror they forgot of the past rejected the future and  immersed themselves in the present  I listen to the tremble of the dragonfly's wings and obliterate the lacy cobwebs that surround me ready to pull me in.  I think I'll leave this place undisrupted and undisturbed let it dwindle to the ground as wood splinters and rafters fall  I'll speak to my reflection in the water and hope that unrelentless time doesn't tear me apart...

      Car Crash  I've spent endless hours trapped in Nowhere I'm lost in this nothingness Red and blue lights flash incessantly in the distance but I focus on the horizon uniting the ocean and the endless expanse of gray sky Time is slipping away the hourglass is broken and I scream for release Your words bind me I'm unable to escape them entranced by your beauty I follow your every move will you set me free tonight so I can scatter the dew drops over Eden and shatter this enchantment you've spun over me.  (I'm writing this somewhere on this neverending highway! lol!) We just travelled through this enormous storm. Frozen rain was streaming from the clouds, but after driving for 2 kms. the suns muffled rays reached us. Funny how things like this always seem to happen in the Cariboo. (sp?) So we R driving from 70 Mile House back to B.B.L. I can't really remember why we drove here, but there was probaBly a reason...but it's just been constant road work and car accidents all the way, which is making the already lengthy drive 10 times longer and 20 times more tedious. I got a really big fudgsicle tho...which made it all worth while. :D All of the houses and stores around here are either totally run down, abbandoned, or for sale. It's depressing seeing everything just you know, falling apart, hence the sort of bitter tone in this entry. I did get to fraternise (hee hee!) with the locals...well if a couple "Hello's" and dogs trying to eat my food counts as fraternising...and I'll just say that it does. The people in the country are so different than city people. This hot 14 year old guy bumped into me and actually said sorry. It was really bizarre...city guys would just say "move" or whatever, but that's probably because people in the city tend to be a lot more judgemental. Like I doubt those guys would say "move" to some blonde girl wearing slutty clothes and too much make-up, because that's what they consider "attractive." But because I'm just a freak standing around wearing chokers and band T-shirts I don't seem to matter. North American society is so shallow.

      So I'm at my cabin at Big Bar Lake. I should probably talk about the lake a bit shouldn't I? OK, well it's 5 hours away from Vancouver. The drive is really long and tiring and you pass through what seems like hundreds of towns that are falling apart. The last of these being a town called Clinton. Big Bar Lake is 45 minutes away from this town, and can be reached by driving along this brutal gravel road. There's a point in the road where you can finally see the lake, and it looks really cool. The water is actually several colours depending on the it's depth. There's the indigo part, the turquoise part, and the teal part. There's a marshy portion which is the closest part when you look at it from this little view point in the road. Anywho, as you continue along the road you pass this old, abbandoned ranch, that actually has foot long grass sprouting out of it's roof. It's very creatively stimulating to go there alone, and I probably will later this visit. After this you reach my family's cabin-y thing, which actually looks really strange from outside, but In other news, my birthday's coming up! Yay! I'm hoping for a lot of CD's. :D Hee hee! OOh, dinner's ready so I'll be saying goodbye for a bit!

      Today sorta sucked. We had to present and finish composing our hip hop routines today. God, I hate that stuff. We had to do our routines to this really loud crap music and I get seriously pissed just listening to the stuff. You can't even really classify it as music...it's just sort of noise with a few catchy melodies thrown in here and there. I seriously felt like injuring the person who made us do hip hop. And, everyone was bugging me trying to borrow my Converse shoes and stuff, and I was like "Uh..no.Go buy your own stupid shoes." I'll shutup now, and stop making everyone elses lives miserable. To make this post more interesting I'll post a poem.  Hourglass  There's no time to remember just time to forget  Visions of you creep through my mind like whispers I never should have heard I never had you and I don't deserve you yet I can't lie and say I don't want you but I can pretend.  Everydays a cherade put on to hide from you I don't need to speak when I have a pen to translate raw emotions into words that you'll never hear cuz they will never escape the pages of this book.  We will always be stuck on opposite sides of the looking glass and I can't break this glass time is running out for us.

      Bonjour! I'm posting yet again. Here's another song. It's a little worse than the last one, and I haven't finished it yet. I know you should never post a work in progress, but I think I'll just fuck that cuz no one ever reads this anyways. Hee hee! OK, so here it is...  Symptoms of Total Collapse (Another totally irrelevent name)  I've been wasting my days on failed attempts at poetry been wasting my days on you I've been wasting my nights on ten hours sleep been wasting my nights on you  You've distorted the archives of my life quite enough I'd like to forget  I'm sure you're sorry so how about you say it You know I'm hurting But what are you gonna do about it? Just forget? (let ME forget)  Slip into the sheets of frozen rain awaiting you beyond this door go on, let the ice penetrate your skin and pierce your heart the same way that apologetic look pierced mine  Yeah, I know it's not me it's you why did you have to say what we both already know skip the cliches and move on to the truth  "Let's just be friends." After you've killed me with your words and your apologetic look?  I'm sure you're sorry so how about you say it? you know I'm hurting  But what are you gonna do about it? Just forget? (Let ME forget)  I love this city we live in I can hide among high rise buildings write your name on their walls  I'm sure you're sorry so how about you say it? You know I'm hurting But what are you gonna do agout it? Just forget?! (Let ME forget!!!!)  I hope I've torn you apart with song I'll write in my book of tangents once more and then I'll forget.

      (I'm here procrastinating again. There's not much to say so I think I'll just post this song I wrote last night. It was wierd because usually when I write songs I think of the melody first, and the lyrics later, but I still don't actually have a melody to go along with this one.)   Kansas Here I am standing in Somewhere That Doesn't Matter I glance at the window and draw pictures on hazy glass only to see them fade into summer.  Here I am someone who doesn't matter It's a quarter past nine and I don't know what to do with myself shall I hang the stars in the sky or blot out the moon with my fists?  Shall I let myself be broken with words? Shall I drown in your eyes and live with regrets?  Rearrange the hotel curtains as stale cigarette smoke enters my ruin I read postcards from home and wonder how I ever got so far away I can't bear to be with you can't bear to be without you you're a drug, a guilty pleasure  a habit that I just can't break.  Shall I let myself be broken with words? Shall I drown in your eyes and live with regrets? Shall I hide in this city of stars where the light never reaches anyone's gaze?  I look in the shattered mirror and see pieces of me. was it my rage that pierced that glass? It's just that the seasons never change here, the people never feel here. it's called paradise but it's becoming my hell.  Shall I let myself be broken with words? Shall I drown in your eyes and live with regrets? Shall I kill the night for you?!  I could string together thousands of words but say nothing at all Now I utter the first truth to the hotel curtains "I need you."  Shall I let myself be broken with words? (BROKEN BY YOU) Shall I drown in your eyes and live with regrets?   Here I am someone who doesn't matter fading into you.

      Hello again. I am, as you may have guessed, procrastinating. School ends soon anyways. Who cares about the last two weeks or however long it is untill summer? Everyone except for those obsessed with school are just kind of trying to finish everything as fast as possible without failing, or at least that's how it works at my school where we're all slackers! Tee hee! Anyways...my life's good. I've been doing a lot of sleeping and sugar eating this weekend so i'm actully very, very, very happy right now! *contented sigh* I think I'll go write a book!

      Rectitude  There's a mirror on the wall a twisted rose envelopes it's frame and I glimpse at the glass it caresses I look beyond my reflection I permeate the looking glass and see all of my hidden secrets written across my face.  I wonder how I've ignored them for so long there's a tear cascading down my cheek it's my offering to U but it will never be enough.  There's a scar along my face it's so easy to see that I've been broken and shoved back together  forced to go on without you and it's killing me  There's a shimmer of something Unnamed in my eyes there are words that cling to my lips words that I've never spoken until tonight.  "I need U..."  So as the sun descends  as the water stills I'll be awaiting your reply. though it might be too soon and it might be too late for U to hear me.

      You know those moments when everything is right?? Like when the guy you like smiles at you and you just know that he's not looking at the girl behind you and that there's no strange pimple on your forehead. Or when you sit around with your friends listening to music and you suddenly know why the band Soundtrack of Our Lives chose the name and they did and you're aware that you've been subconcsiuosly creating the soundtrack to your life for years. Or when the guy you like talks to you when he doesn't have to and he stares right into your eyes and you run home and dance around in your room listening to Hit Or Miss by NFG. And you sing along like no one's listening cuz even if they are U could care less.  And I've had those moments. I wish they were just a little less rare, because looking forward to them would seem more reasonable. But I don't know...I never do.

      What It is to Burn by Finch  "Today's on fire  The sky is beating above me, and I am blister  I walk these signs of blasphemy, every day  And still:   Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her  She's the only one who knows, what it is to burn   I feel diseased  Is there no sympathy, for the sun  The sky's still fire  But I am safe in here, from the world outside   So tell me  What's the price to pay for glory   Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her  She's the only one who knows, what it is to burn   Today is fine, and she burns  Today is fine, and she burns  She burns  She burns  She burns  She burns  She burns  She burns   Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her  She's the only one who knows, what it is to burn"

      My venting is done now, as is my Spill-Canvas-listening-period. I also listened to Hawthorne Heights, in an attempt to convince myself that I am not entirely "mushy." Heh heh. Anywho, I had some totally insane dreams last night. It's wierd, cuz I always have wicked dreams when I eat pickles and/or chocolate ice cream b4 I go to bed. Funny hey?? Yeah...there was a lot of climbing up stairs, conversing with nuns, smashing glass, and maniacal laughter going on. I went into my dream dictionary and looked all that stuff up and it told me that I need to control that temper of mine, that I will soon go thru a trying period of my life, and that love life is going to improve. Bullshit. K, I refuse to get depressed again...I think I'll sleep away another day. (lol!)

      You know what? I hate N.P. for tearing me apart with fucking silence. I hate him for being so hard to hate. He's too wonderful to fully loathe. Why couldn't he just be an asshole?? That would make everything so much better cuz I could just be like, "Fuck you. I'm too good for you anyways." But honestly, I don't deserve him because I'm such a jaded retard. I hope he goes off with his little friend Agnes (not her real name, it's just a shitty name, so she deserves it) cuz she's so much easier to understand and she's so fucking obvious in the way she feels about him. I'm emotionless. Emotions lead to pain, embarrassment, etc. But to Him, I'm sorry for being such a cold hard bitch. I tried not to be, but it didn't work. God, I hate him for so many reasons. I hate him for making me believe that every little moment meant something, and that he actually liked me in that way, although maybe I imagined it all. I hate him for disappearing, and leaving me hanging. I hate him because he's probably forgotten about everything...and I hate him for making me  feel all this shit, but what can I do??? Absolutely nothing...except for listening to The Spill Canvas, and sulking. I'm such a loser.

      For N.P.  My eyes are fighting sleep as I write this for you my pen skims across the paper it's not capable of capturing any of this  I'm transparent as glass when I'm with you pleas don't shatter me don't disappoint me  Just cast your shadow on the walls and I'll speak to it I cannot bear to meet your eyes they penetrate me they permeate my skin  you have unimaginable power over me  All I want is for you to stay here with me don't disappear into the night the way you always seem to  please tell me the truth What is it you want?? yet you speak your own language and I can't understand  Yes, I'm transparent as glass when I'm with you but don't make assumptions don't take me for granted  Just breathe in the night air  listen to the wind speak  and sty here with me.

      Among the Roses  I lie here trapped among roses the colour of blood there's a thorn in my side but I dare not move and break this noiseless perfection  I'm awaiting you're arrival awaiting you return to me and this empire of silence.  I want you to pull me from my bed of thorns an d reawaken the spirit within me I want you to take me away show me the atmosphere you travel the hillsides strewn with flowers that you walk show me how to live again  You're long overdue here Will you ever come?? Are you just an image created by this foolishly hopeful mind?  I whisper, "every noise I hear I think it's you every breath I take I take for you but it's not enough to bring you back to me..."  Day fades to night stars spill across an otherwise empty sky as the fermament bleeds fire  I lift myself from among the roses look upon this emptiness that has been my prison and I think of you...  I pull a scarlet blossom and crush it in my hand let the petals complete there soft descent and slowly hit the ground  I turn my back nd leave these ruins with only a scar on my side left to remind me of my Waiting.

      Life's been uneventful. I've been reading, writing, thinking about a certain person and all of the other things I seem to spend countless hours doing...I saw Spider-Man 2 yesterday, and I thought it was pretty good. The way it was filmed and some of the little things that were included for pure entertainment made it in some ways better than the first, but the ending was kind of...meh. You know?? I got a ben and jerry's cherry garcia bar to eat there and that was really delicious. *Hee hee! Hawksley Workman!* -inside joke with myself!- So,y eah that was good. I'm planning my birthday party too...it's kind of a lot later than my actual birthday but, whatever. I'm currently obsessed with The Spill Canvas, and this Dashboard Confessional song called Screaming Infidelites that I'm sure everyone knows...Oh, God...I'm getting into all this sentimental, acoustic-y stuff!! AHHHHH! Hee hee...sudden bursts of hyperness...I'm also into The Prize Fight, Northstar, The Juliana Theory (as I've probably mentioned!!), The Starting Line, and With Broken Wings. I actually named this blog after one of their songs. It's such a bad emo-ish title for a blog but I seriously ran out of ideas and it started playing on I-tunes, and I was like, "Hey! How about Sympathy Page?!" Yeah so I'll stop rambling now...Except, I need to post this one poem that I actually like up here. Oh, and I'm still waiting for Revolutions on Canvas to come...shipping is so slow!! Oh well, I'm shutting up...

      So...today is the day when the Vans Warped Tour comes to Vancouver, and I can't go. I am left home alone with a box of pizza that seems to be mysteriously emptying. (I'm so bloated now...) My song writing is all sucking, probably because I'm all depressed because I can't write a song like "Oh the world is cruel/I cannot go to the wartped tour and see Taking Back Sunday, Story of the Year, Hazen Street, etc." Well, I could but it would suck worse than usual...Anywho, I don't know if I mentioned that my brother ordered Revolutions on Canvas for my birthday. I'm stoked to read it! Other than that my life's been a whole lot of nothing lately, although I suppose I haven't been tempting fate or anything while I sit around and eat large quantities of food at home. I did go to Becky's for a sleep over, but I think I'm allergic to her rats or something because I've never sneezed so much in my life! LOL! They R adorable though..Everyone is always like "rats??! EEW!" but they R so sweet! People judge them just because they have creepy tails. They can't help it! Yeah, so yesterday Becky, Melissa, and I went shopping and took the wrong bus, and we had to call my brother and be like "Uh...how do we get to Park Royal from Phibbs Exchange??" It was actually incredibly hillarious, cuz it's kinda hard to do what we did. Well it was funny except for the fact that we were on a bus for 2 and a half hours and we ate lunch at like 3:00. But, shopping was good. It was kinda our attempt to get Melissa some new clothes so that she can avoid the whole skank label next year, cuz she's going to a different highschool than Becky and she has this tendancy to pick out the worst clothes ever. At one point she found this lime green mini skirt that was all frilly and we were like "Umm...there's something about it that's not quite right..." LOL! Oh, and I haven't seen N.P. since grad, but I have yet to forget him...

      OK, so I've been away for awhile at my cabin and have had no access to the internet which sux, but now I get to write an incredibly long post! Fun, fun! OK, so I went up to the cabin on June 29th and stayed until July 2nd or something. I did a lot of writing and thinking and picture taking and canoeing and a lot of other things that one often does in the summmer time. The weather was pretty nice, except for the two hail storms we had, but that is to be expected when you stay in the Cariboo (sp??). I celebrated my birthday and received the new Spitalfield CD, which is really good. If anyone reading this is interested in Jimmy Eat world, and similar sounding bands you will probably take a liking to Spitalfield, as they have the same sort of vibe. Ummm...I've for the most part tried to stop thinking of N.P. I'm way to good for him anyway! LOL! So that's what happened @ big bar lake, but afterwards I visited my friend's cabin, which was really fun despite an infestation of carpenter ants. The architecture in the area is totally insane though! There were houses painted fuschia and turquoise and lime green and stuff, which was very different from the dull greys and whites that are frequently seen in Vancouver. I got to watch a bagpiping concert there too!! It was deffinitely a new type of music for me! The performers even wore the traditional tartan kilts and stuff, which was kind of strange. After watching the concert there's only one thing I should say: the bagpipes are perhaps THE most difficult instrument ever. Just watching them play I was like "Wow..." So that was entertaining, and I am in slightly better shape after walks and hikes and swimming and stuff. So, that has been my life lately. I'll post a couple of songs and poems in a moment....  Bad Dogs and Gentlemen  I burned down your house and watched the flames lick at it I'm not a pyromaniac yet the sense of satisfaction was immense  -Chorus- this is the calm before the storm a chance for us to breathe before we dive right into the tempest  The lightning's your words the thunder my bitter retorts that fades into the night and is forgotten  I'll escape from these flames and slip thru the door like the breath U let out before you told me you didn't mean for it to be like this  -Chorus-  U said, "I never meant to lead U on I never meant to make you believe I felt that way I never meant to deceive U."  too bad you can't change what's already happened (bring an end to this tempest)  -Chorus-  Yeah, nothing ever seems to change... -end-  Creaking Floorboards (giving away secrets.)  The wolf howls as the sun dips ever lower the beauty of this forsaken lake but I'm not sure if this is heaven of if it's hell please deffine what I can't seem to put into words...  I'm powerless as your eyes meet mine but will you be my saviour pull me from destruction or will you push me ever deeper into the flames??  Soon I'll know what it is to have one's life stolen by fire to burn with no release...  I don't know what I'm feeling anyomre I've opened my own wounds ever wider and I wonder why they never seem to heal.  the sun slips away behind the hillsides as the full moon errupts from it's hiding place it spreads it's shallow light over the fields encompassed in a darkness that's otherwise unbroken  I can't seem to hide from you anymore so I cling to whispers of you and these glowing embers that burn out so quickly I'm just asking to be hurt... -end-  Flight 187  The land that lies below me appears as patchwork I'm spinning through the air in a craft I've no reason to trust flight is so unnatural to me...  When tomorrow dawns I'll be miles away from home miles away from reality my past will be unknown I'll meander through crowds, Anonymous.  I'm the secret that everyone's dying to know I'm the one mystery in a world that's been robbed of all it's cryptic secrets  I'm the shadow that hides when it rains I'm the whisper you never should have heard yet will never forget -end-  Fountains of youth  Would you like to buy the world from me?? God knows it's falling into disrepair This empty countryside stretches into forever and there's nothing here that I haven't seen before.  Although the signs claim there's so much to be had here we both know that's a lie all that's left are broken dreams and jaded creatures  -Chorus- Life's for sale won't U buy into this?? Though we said "cross my heart and hope to die we never kept our word and now nothing really maters anymore. (NOTHING REALLY MATTERS)  Heaven spits on us for we've betrayed the angels  Our dreams for lives behind white picket fences have faded away we locked them up somewhere and lost the key...  -chorus-  I've lost the power to slow this down (SLoW THIS DOWN) What happened to the time we had left?? (TIME SLIPS AWAY)  -chorus-  please buy the world from me -end-  Talking backwards  The church parking lot's empty this morning they say the believers never die but did anyone believe all of this??  Chorus And now we're talking backwards not meaning what we say can't you break this silence?? and fix what I have broken  This small town's falling apart I can't reconstruct it because it was never mine  now there's a car parked on your front lawn I thought you'd like to know  -chorus-  we're all to wrapped up in our own problems to bother with yours... (there's a car on your front lawn..) ---roundy thing----  -chorus-

      I wish that I could write decent songs...Thursday's written a fucking masterpiece, so why can't I? I'm told that my expectations are too high, but whatever. I seem to be only able to write some very mediochre melodies, and lyrics and it's frustrating and depressing when you're not very good at the one thing that you really live for. Yeah...I'm depressed. I think I'll blame it on The Catcher In The Rye, which I am very nearly done now. It's a good book, but it's depressing. I find that I feel sorry for just about every character. I don't know why. Half the time Holden Caulfield or whoever he is is like "and it made me kind of feel sorry for him/her in a wierd way." They didn't exactly have to say that. You already feel this wierd pity towards everyone in the book. The part about the prostitute was funny though...anywho...here's some mediochre poetry that I know you're all really excited to read.   Turn Off Your Mind  I wish that I could touch your star spattered face but I am unworthy of You I am Jaded where as you could fly among angels if you wanted to they'd accept you arms outstretched wings caught in flight eyes afire with the hope, and goodness that is oh so charecteristic of the Angel and they'd kiss you goodbye bid you farewell and wish you good luck living in a world among the Jaded but you would never want to fly with them now is not the time you're convinced that you belong here you're so uncorrupted and beautiful I shouldn't even be thinking of you I should cross uot your eyes hide them under a strand of darkness like the teenaged delinquents on T.V. no, I think I'll just turn off my mind for the time being so I can forget about you...

      Hello. It's 9:45 and I'm sitting in bed listening to Three Doors Down. The song is called Be Like That. It's nice to fall asleep to...I can smell gasoline from the world outside my window.It's also nice to smell the city. You don't really notice a lot of things until you're re-introduced to them. Only when I've been away can I come home and appreciate the sirens, and gasoline, and constant barking of dogs. "If I could be like that, what would I do??" I don't think I'd ever want to be anyone except myself...except maybe the girl that he* loves, but that would be living a lie.. The song just changed. It's Iris by The Goo Goo Dolls. "I'd give up forever to touch you.." God, this song makes me depressed...I can be such an emo kid sometimes, and at other times I'm the total opposite. Some emotions scare me. Like being in Love...I don't have to worry about that. It's not like I'm actually in love or anything...I just have a crush on a guy...Crush. I hate that word. It soundsa so juvenile and meaningless. Maybe that's why I wanted to call it love, tho it was probably a one sided love.. It meant something to me. Actually, it still means something to me. It shouldn't though. I know that. I can't quite accept it though... The song just changed again. It's If All Else Fails by Matchbook Romance. It's hard not to go all "emo" when you're listening to lyrics like MBR's. Yeah. It's all Andrew Jordan's fault.... It's not like it could be mine, or anything...  Please don't let me cry again tonight stop the tears before they've begun and kiss me goodnight and then forever will be alright I know it will...

I wish that I could believe in something be my own religion that might just be enough...

      Last night I had the wierdest dream. There was this blue vase full of dead flowers, and all of these questions filled my head, and I was really frantic cuz the flowers COULDN'T be dead. And I was thinking, "Why are they dead? Who killed them? Was it me? What's happening?" This dream may have been a result of the chocolate cake, or this book I'm writing that involves dead flowers. I don't know. I was going to look it up in my dream dictionary but I've decided not to, cuz that's all bullshit and it was too real, and too wierdly frightening to be dissected by some stupid book written by some guy who thinks he knows all of this deep stuff, that's actually just BS...

      I feel like telling U where I stand on the worlds Ashlee Simpson obsession. I've only heard like one song by her but I think she's having an identity crisis. She wants to be everything her sister isn't in order to distinguish herself from her sister. It's all just a rebellion for her. I doubt that she gives  a fuck about music.

      "Aw! You'd make such a cute couple!" Those were the first words my friend said when I confessed about "him", but I don't know. You see, he's one of those Beautiful People, and he fully doesn't sit in front of the mirror in order to achieve that. He just IS...and then there's me. Jaded. Freakish. Wierd. You know who I am. I don't blame him for not loving someone like that. Maybe I'm making excuses. I'm just telling myself that it wouldn't have worked out in order to make myself feel OK for not doing anything. I don't know what I'm doing........ Is it wierd to miss someone U barely know? Is it wierd to want to kiss that person? Is it wierd for that person to appear in almost all of your dreams? He usually is just some inconspicuous person that walks by and smiles. Sometimes He says something. I can never remember what. Sometimes we kiss. Those are the times that I don't really want to wake up but maybe that's what I need to do...Wake Up.

      I wish someone would just comment. Tell me that my poetry sucks, tell me that I'm wasting my time on Him. Just say anything, because I feel really alone right now, like I'm not really here... I was gonna do all of these things today but I never really got around to doing them so I just sat down, listened to the Smiths, and tried not to cry. I know everyone's thinking that I'm all sentimental and that my results from the emo quiz @ Fuali.com were totally right, but I'm not always like this. I just write in my blog when I'm in one of thes "moods." But it's not really a mood. Sometimes a song is totally saying everything that you feel, and it's kinda uncanny. That's the way it was when I cried along to Iris, and Here is Gone by the Goo Goo Dolls, and Asleep by the Smiths, and This Ride by the Starting Line, and I Don't Wanna Know by NFG. That's a good example, because right after my whole thing with Him I went home and I turned on Catalyst and I listened to that song. And everything thy said I felt, but that time it was a happy listen, cuz I thought that everything might still end up right, and the Handsworth thing wouldn't change anything. But now everytime I listen to I don't Wanna Know it just makes me think of that moment and it makes me wish that I could live caught in that happiness, in those moments where nothing matters and it's OK to be naive. I wish that was what life was like. I wish that I could stop overanalysing situations, and stop being obsessive, and stop having my "rules" the way my brother says I should. I think I've lived my whole life with those "rules", and I haven't just thrown them away and been like "Fuck this. How about I just have fun?" That's  a hard thing for me to do.  I don't know why...It shouldn't be, because I'm thirteen. That's what I'm supposed to be like but I'm so independant...too independant, and I like to make my own decisions, yet I always wait to long, thinking about the pros and cons of making the decision to actually make it. I get caught in between the do and the don't and when I've finally made my choice it's too late, because I'll have wasted too much time, and then I sit with my regrets and write melodramatic teenaged poetry. Yes, I'm aware that a lot of my stuff is shit, except for the last one I wrote and Kansas...most of it's just me wallowing in self pity or whatever.  But yeah. Just comment and say anything to remind me that I'm still OK........

      So I'm starting to read The Catcher In The Rye and it's really good so far, but I'm trying to save it so I can have it to look forward to when I get all depressed. Mood swings suck, but I am told that "That's just the hormones." Sometimes it's nice to always have excuses like that to fall back on. I'm getting kind of nervous/excited for school because it starts soon, and I guess it's kind of scary this year because of the whole highschool thing.  But I'm kinda trying to convince myself that I'll be fine, but as I am, according to my brother, parents, and friends dyslexic with directions it's hard to believe that I won't get lost less than ten times. Does that sentence make sense?? Oh well...it doesn't matter. So I'm also trying to convince myself that just because He's going to Handsworth doesn't mean I'll never see him again, but it's like even if I do what the hell do I say?? "Hi! I haven't seen U since like June, but do U wanna go out sometime?" I think not.  Am I being obsessive?? I took this personality disorder test online that was supposedly written by proffessionals and everything and I'm 40% obsessive compulsive. I'm 60% schizotypal too, whatever that means. The rest I was like five percent. But, what the hell do these supposed "proffessionals" know about me? Nothing.  But I guess they're on the same level as almost everyone else out there...I'm talking in circles, aren't I? Sorry...I'll try to stop that...OK, that's all for now! P.S. It's so good to be back in the city...I just had to write that... :D

      And I think you should know that it makes me sick to know that you fuck him not for love, but for fucks sake. yeah, you make me sick sometimes you and your lust and your well-we-all-have-needs crap and the excuses that you make for all of your bad decisions.  U say, "What's wrong with you? You never used to be like this..." and that's what they've all been saying lately yeah, that's what they all say and darling, I wish that I knew.  I'll light a match just to watch it burn you can't shed light on this situation. (x2)  You should know that it makes me sick to know that you fuck him for fucks sake. YOU MAKE ME SICK....

      Faces of Rememberance  These useless trinkets crowd my room I wonder why I saved them Oh yes they were to remind me of all of the summers and set me off on the remember-when's that I've already forgotten.  Your face crowds my mind and disrupts my thoughts you make it hard to think straight I wish that you never happened I wish that I weren't sitting here wondering how you taste wondering what you're thinking and then cursing you and cursing me for letting myself fall into you like I am...  And I never wanted to be trapped in silence I never wanted to come down with this Illness I never wanted to need you but what I want doesn't seem to matter anymore no what I want has never mattered I just liked to pretend that it did.  *    *    *    *    *  Rainy Days  Today I questioned reality and I stared at the fragments of blue sky that weren't covered by a blanket of Gray and I wondered if today would ever end.  I brushed out my hair and stained the carpets and the blankets with my tears who I cry for  I still don't know.  I am hopeless.  I watched as the birds flew away and I waved them a temporary goodbye they know that there's nothing left for them here but I'm still struggling to accept that thought I'm still trying to Convince myself thta this is paradise  We both know it's not  So I'll tie a string around my finger so I can remember to forget  I went outside to pick some wildflowers so I could save them form the storm that was approaching instead I drowned them in my tears.  WHO DO I CRY FOR? answer me please cuz I still don't know...  I never have time to think about it though I'm too busy tieing a string 'round my finger so I can remember to forget.

      So I'm sitting here and nothing's enough. Losing myself in my writing isn't enough. That's how I've been living lately. Through fictional characters and through him. I hope his life is better than mine. And I'm praying for a storm so I can just lie here, undisrupted and be lathargic. But IS that what I want?? I don't know anymore...I used to thrive thinking about the next CD i would buy and the next song I would write as if music could remedy everything. I think I genuinely believed that, but now I don't know. Am I just being cynical? Is it normal to feel like this? Is this how depressed people think? But I'm not depressed...I just have mood swings. Sometimes there's everything to live for and sometimes there's nothing. It all depends on the time, the light, the weather, and me. Me. I should probably just live for me instead of living for other people, and CDs, and storms, and long drives at night. Or maybe I should just live and not question why the way that I am. It's just that I've never been like that...

      (sorry, just had to say that..)  Do You Ever  Do you ever  drift away in dreams where we are together Unbroken?  Do you ever  open your window just to taste the rain in all it's sweet, faded glory?  Do you ever look in the mirror see what you've become and hide among sheets from the world you've bee beatewn by again?  Do you ever play games with my heart?  Would you ever leave me to bleed in my world of concrete and shadow where I'll be alone with my suicide notes and the ghost of a sick smile playing on my lips?  Do you ever run from decisions let fate make them for you as you just watch the scenery fly by? (green, gray, and aquamarine)  Do you ever  close your eyes and think of the what-if's, the maybe's, and the never-minds or are you just another boy that I've wasted time on?  Do you know  what it is to bleed or to feel so alive?  Yeah, do you ever? Do you know? Did you ever?   *    *    *    *    *  This is a one time offer take it or leave it you decide  I'm not gonna wait forever make up your mind  Do you want me?  You should know by now or do you want me to decide for U? If it comes to that forget it. Just forget about me and all of this.  *    *    *    *    *  Spit out your pleases and your thankyous that's all we want from U.   Now, please keep your mouth closed sweetheart it just overflows with lies you are deceit incarnate.  *    *    *    *    *

      I am empty now your smiles left with August I can't bring them back.  *    *    *    *    *  The sun slides away as threads of colour and light bleed across the sky.  *    *    *    *    *  Embroider my heart with your needle and thread "Deal with a little pain it won't hurt too much." So I'm to be your canvas let you do what you want with me? Please go find yourself another fool who will fall for your charm and your perfect teeth and will pass her heart to you willingly so it can bew embroidered with lies in living colour red white and blue.  *    *    *    *    *  Lawlessness  The clock strikes midnight and sleep is disrupted we'll slip through the hallways candle in hand casting shadow that linger on the walls.  We'll break free from redundancy become a walking disaster ready to kill the shadows that stalk us wherever we go.  catastrophe, cateclysm (sp?), disorder Anarchy runs free tonight turmoil, chaos the laws that we so dutifully abide by have all been broken come midnight and we can't even remember our sins.

      The sky totally looked like a Salvador Dali painting tonight. It was just the way the sun hit the clouds and made them look amber, and the way the clouds were shaped...it was all totally Dali-esque, but I'm wierd sometimes...  Bulletin Boards  Yours is the face on the poster that reads MISSING, LOST.  Yours is the story that at the first listen drew a tear but by the third we're making you disappear MISSING we push you deeper under the label and as day turn to years all that will be left of you is a faded poster that reads MISSING,  Lost.

      I'm sick and all I can hear is my mom's Joni Mitchell CD and I don't really like it. It makes me feel all nostalgic for a generation I was never part of, if that makes any sense, which it probably doesn't. My head is spinning...The blinds are flapping and everything is making me think of the lyrics to Kansas. Because a fiva and a half our drive might as well take days, you know?? I have 7 days to go here and I'm going insane. Yes, I was already insane, but now it's 25 times worse. I've listened to all of my CD's and cried to the Goo Goo Dolls the way I always seem to. It's impoaaible to exlpain why. I need to stop being like this...
