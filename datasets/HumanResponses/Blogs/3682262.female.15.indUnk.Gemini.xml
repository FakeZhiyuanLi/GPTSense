      Hi! Well if you haven't guessed already I did NOT write that last post! haha. Beth Collins is very sneaky and changed my password to make an entry. lol So I'm  not  a lesbian w/ Cassie and I think Tommy Hunt is  very nasty . (just for the record! haha) Oh and something else for the record- Beth doesn't get me things to eat &/or drink when I need them. She says- go get it yourself! Now that everything is cleared up I have to tell y'all that Evan is not exactly single anymore. (sorry ladies, haha) He has a 'long-distance lova'! haha No more details for you! Well I just got off the phone with Beth and she's gonna try to be sneaky again, so any entries withiin the next 17 days are not me! (obviously, cuz I'll be in Canada... then NYC!) alrighty well I'm leaving tomorrow morning and I haven't even started packin (bad news! haha) so I got to jet! Bye!

      Hey everybody! Okay, so I'm Laurel Mallory and I love Beth Collins more than life itself. She is my everything. I wish I could see her all the time, but unfortunately, I'm going to Canada and then New York so I'm gonna be without her for like a month. She's my best friend. What in the hell would I do without Beth? She does everything for me. She does all my favors for me. When I need something to drink, who goes to get it? Beth does. When I'm hungry, who goes to get me food? BETH DOES! Who calls me when I'm sad? BeTh DoEs! She has a toothbrush at Brandon's house. How cool is she?! VERY! Okay well I just thought I'd let the whole world know how much I love Beth. And how much Cassie Brummet and I have lesbian tendencies. Yes. We have phone sex. She's my LUVVAAA! I love Tommy Hunt, too. He loves to give me lovin'. He's my MAN LUVVAAA! Alright, time to leave. THESE STUPID BLACK PEOPLE DONT KNOW HOWTA DANCE!!! Love ya! *Laurel Fucking Mallory!*

      Well I was talking to Evan earlier bout this whole blog thang and he was like is there anything about me in it? and i was like no... so I'm makin him happy now haha. (plus, I think this is the only way to get him to ever look at this haha) Well he's like my best guy friend and we've been friends for about 2 years I reckon. His middle name is James and his last name is Dusynzki. (I don't think I spelled that right, I never do- I'm awful, I know!) Some ppl call him Ed for short... but I don't! I call him Evie, haha. He's the same age as me (15) and in my grade (10th). He has blonde hair and he's like um, not real tall but not short. (I'm guessing 5'7"?) He likes playin sports (soccer, basketball...) and of course he like watchin them on tv. He's a good guy- nice, cute, smart, alla that good stuff. (And he's single unless there's something he's not tellin me so go for it girls. haha) Okay, I hope he's happy now cuz this took me a while and I'm gonna go now! Choi! (oh and his AIM sn is Ed407 and he's gonna kill me for puttin this on here but I think it's funny, so IM him!)

      This is what I put on my profile about Brandon:   Brandon Cutwright LOVES Joey Brown!!! (bjcballer)- Brandon, (JoeyDBrown)- Joey! bjcballer: i give head for quarters, i give joey head for free, but i gotta charge for everybody else so tell everybody u know, im tryin to make money  okay, I'll tell you about Joey Brown- he's this guy from Alabama and Brandon talked to him on the internet a lot and thought he was really cool... well one day Joey got on and they were talking bout doing stuff with girls and then Joey told Brandon that his friend Jimmy gave him head the other night and 'it was good'. Brandon was like is Jimmy a girl? and Joey was like no. and Brandon was like eww and Joey was like 'don't knock it til you try it'. lol freakin hilarious kids, freakin hilarious... Brandon tried getting back at me with this but really now- no where close:  definiton of prostitute:  Person who sells there body in exchange for money so they can make a living.  Synonyms: Laurel Mallory  OMG I just remembered that my brother almost killed me n Beth n Meagan 2day. we went to help my Dad with his car club's car show in Augusta and we left with Dean when he went to Maysville to get Meagan... well on the way home we were on this real curvy road and we were goin like 100 i swear and i see this sign that says to go 30 m.p.h. around this curve and i'm thinkin holy shit we're gonna die! it was scary... but fun i'll have to admit. lol   well i'm done. you've just heard about another exciting nite in the life of Laurel Mallory. hasta luego.

Well she climbed up it (only to go back down it- scaredy cat) and a dead spider and it's web went into her mouth while she was eating her popsicle! It's 11:11 make wishes! Brandon is putting obscene things on his profile and it's making me just a lil bit angry... lol look: Laurel's top 3 things: 1.Girls 2.Girls 3.Girls oh and did i mention girls, dont believe me, look at this sexynsweet0719: i love girls, i really do. but dont say nothin'&nbsp; urlLink

      I just wanted to let y'all know that it's gone! I'm better! And I'm so happy and I dunno how I realized it was gone but it is definately gone. And well- no more weird feeling in the tummy. I feel good. I feel very proud of myself and it actually took me by surprise but I reckon I'm stronger than I thought. yay! :)  very yay . You do not understand how yay this actually is. I hope it lasts. I really really really do.           *hint: this has to do w/ the stupid boys of my life

      I made a strange discovery 2day (well I think that i've known for a while, but oh well) my arm hairs are out of control! lol I swear, they like won't even like lay flat on my arm they're just all weird. I thought I'd share that with y'all. And, um... I don't think I have anything else to say. 'night.

      Well I'm sitting here with Beth and Liz and we're kinda bored. I made a good discovery today- I learned how to make my cell phone (um... George, that is...  shhhhh ) say 'Laurel' instead of '713481481848 units'. ya know. Well you prolly don't but oh well! Beth says-  "I know how you make babies!"  haha she's so dumb. We walked into the wonderful city of Berry earlier!- we needed pop and everywhere's closed, so we went to the pop machine with like $6 in change haha. 'my parents don't remember my first name... I mean my first word' haha I can't talk. (that's not news) A piece of advice for anyone who's sunburn is itching: lie on the floor (tummy side up!) and like move your back over the carpet and it feels good! haha Beth got that from Tyler and I think it really works. The Max is 4?!  ...AnYwAyS...  I went to Dwayne's visitation today. It wasn't that bad I reckon. I didn't know him that well though... I dunno what I would do if he was really close to me. I just think if that was one of my really good friends... god- it's crazy! It's gotta be shit for his family and all his real close friends, I'm praying for them. It can happen to anyone and that's a  really  scary thought. But I think it opened up a lot of people's eyes in so many ways. For me and Beth and Jess it's got us to be nice... We've been bitches to a lot of people lately and we're trying to fix that. I think we've all decided on our to own to be nicer to people and apologize for things we've done in the past. I don't want to not be able to fix things, if ya know what I mean? I dunno... It doesn't really seem real that he's dead. I mean I still kind of expect to see him driving around places and stuff and I'm not. It like hasn't sunk in I reckon. I know things like this are going to happen- and might hit me a little closer to home next time... I'm praying they won't. I'm praying.

      Ello loves. I've gone through some drama recently. well... i stayed on here ' toooo  late' the other night, and um, my dad took the keyboard away. (and the mouse) for like a day. wooo big freakin deal! please. well i'm back! haha and better than ever i reckon... i got a $5 shirt at JC Penny 2day! how exciting! haha earlier today i realized that what i  really  wanted to do, like more than a lot of things, was to go muddin'. how fun would that be?! i mean it's like 4-wheelin... but in a truck. seriously- how could anyone think that wouldn't be fun? maybe pointless... but still fun! (*hint* you should be making a 'note to self' "laurel REALLY wants to go muddin"! haha) hmm... what rhymes w/ muddin'? PUDDIN'! lol it kinda does anyways...? i like callin ppl puddin'- is sounds so countryish (but in a good way, i think) like callin them darlin'. it's so fun. lol anyways- ya know i'm gettin pretty tired of all my 'rents rules. they're not normal, i swear! i think they want me to be like one of those girls who sit at home all day and read... and who doesn't have friends, or a reason to use the phone, or get on the internet... or to go to cynthiana! haha i know they're just trying to discipline me (which- if i like it or not- is a good thing) but they're pushing it a lil farrrr in my book. but what do i know? i'm just a lil kid. haha shit. 'night!

      okay... so i just fell in love with Dashboard Confessional. you should, too. here's a sample:  Brilliant Dance  by Dashboard Confessional    So this is odd, the painful realization that all has gone wrong. And nobody cares at all, and nobody cares at all.  So buried all your lovers clothes and burnded the letters lover wrote, but it doesn't make it any better. Does it make it any better? And the plaster dented from your fist in the hall where you had your first kiss reminds you that the memories will fade.  So this is strange, our side stepping has come to be a brilliant dance where nobody leads at all, where nobody leads at all.  And the picture frames are facing down and the riniging from this empty sound  is defeaning and keeping you from this sleep. And breathing is a foreign task  and thinkings just to much to ask and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights.  This is incredible, Starving, insatiable, yes, this is love for the first time. Well you'd like to think that your were invincible. Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time? well this is the last time. This is the last time, This is the last time.    i hate when songs are like exactly right on.

      Hey kids. well it's father's day. things have been normal- dad tried to wake me up at like 10 am this morning (nice try), i've been laying around, i had to break into Beth's house (mat didn't have the key, haha), dean n leslie n dad had been on a motorcycle ride until a lil while ago, dean and meagan are fighting (he jus left to go see her), and well leslie's leaving soon to go back to Morehead and go to work... that leaves me at home, bored, with the 'rents. hmm... sounds excitin, ay?  well i have to say that last nite wasn't that much fun. i need to not try to have ppl over on the weekends of big parties, that never works out too good, haha. okay, so covert n nathan came over for like an hour but um, yay? lol and those 5ths i shoulda got... um that didn't work out either. Dean was very close to gettin some for me but he wasn't goin into maysville... sucked. but one of these days (hopefully sooner than later) i'm gonna get to have my real birthday party, haha. gosh i bet anyone who reads this thinks i'm a big alcoholic or something. believe me, i'm not. i'm a good girl, seriously. i jus like to have fun every once in a while. well i think i'm gonna start writing about more important things than this soon. just be prepared. i'm probably gonna write about things i've never written about before. i never thought i'd write about them in any kind of a thing like this where everyone can read it, but i think i will. maybe soon.

             okay, so today is my birthday. woohoo :) so i figured now would be a good time to start this whole online blog/journal whatever it is thing. i've been meaning to keep a diary for a long time but i never have so maybe this will help. i want something to look at in like 10 years and be like 'gosh i was so dumb!' or cry about it or laugh about it ya know that kinda stuff. okay so maybe i'm a dork, but you'll have to disregard that because you know you want to read this. haha         i think my 'rents are actually talking about buying a cell phone! (wtf?!) and getting a family plan so dean has one, too... i wonder if i get one? WAIT! i already have one- haha. they'll never know... but that's gonna SuCk if they buy me one and i already spent $ on my own. hmm...         well ppl are coming over 2nite (hopefully) and it's gonna be fun (hopefully)... i'll find someway to make it excitin. i was kinda thinkin bout goin over to blue licks like really late and sneaking in to swim when nobody was there... wouldn't that be fun? dunno if that would work but that would definately top breaking into a house! haha (we'll try not to get David grounded this time- sorry beth! lol) i think after the party should be more excitin cuz i better be gettin some 5ths and some swisher sweets for my bday... hmm... or maybe somebody would like get me something besides rum cuz that's all i ever drink. how bout a huge case of beer? haha don't think we could hide that very well. hypnotic? is that expensive? ppl say it's good... atleast me n my girls will have a good time.        my 'rents are also talking bout buying one of those new Dodge Magnum ugly things. well actually order one cuz you can't get one w/ a hemi in it yet or whatever dad's all hyped up about. they're gonna trade in the tahoe and his truck for one- what are they thinking?! i've openly opposed to it but i doubt they care much. i mean who wants to ride in a "nicely designed" (as my dad says) station wagon? *gags* i pray they make the right decision. but then again... if we have less cars by the time i'm 16 1/2, does that mean i get a camaro? i'm praying for that, too.        well that's about it. sorry it's so long- since it's my first entry i went all out i reckon. haha well i have to go talk the 'rents into taking me to the berry festival! yippee! haha Berry's the coolest in case you don't know. i need to take a shower but i'm so sunburned it hurts to touch my head so washing my hair would be painful... but worth it, nonetheless- gotta look good for the sexy cowboys that i'm asking for for my bday, haha. gotta clean my room, gotta do laundry, gotta get a move on. Bye kids!

       July 30   Why is it that sleep is so hard 2 come by these days? I mean geez I woke up at 9:30 this mornin and I'm still up and runnin. I mowed, yippee. Got the same damn blister on my thumb, too. It's so freakin hotttt and it's raining, too. man ain't life grand? haha I'm complaining a lot for no reason, ay? I'm just so freakin bored... and alone! geez it's pretty sad that I can't think of 1 person that I could pick up the phone and talk to right now. (Beth's w/ Adam -e-... lol) Well I could think of 1 but I'm too chicken to call him. that's pathetic, I know. Just don't think he wants a call from me, I'm prolly the furthest thing from his mind and I'm gettin used to it. I mean hell I don't blame him for not caring anymore, just sometimes it pisses me off but I'm not exactly sure who I'm pissed at?   July 31   Why does everything turn into something bout him? I think it's a nitetime thang cuz it's mornin now and well, okay...changing subjects... Deanie's friends from college (Dan & Phil) are comin over for a few days 2day. I'm goin to see if Beth wants to come over... this should be interesting. haha I love it when my house is full of ppl... that's why I love Christmas! Well "the holidays", ya know.    Geez I cannot wait to move into my new room... but I feel kinda bad cuz it's Leslie's old room and she has no where 2 put her stuff in her "cabin" she lives in w/ James. So we were gonna put her stuff into my room, but now Dad's making it into a studio (hmmm... does he not already have one above the garage?) &amp; now when we come back, like when we're older, Leslie won't have a room. Isn't that awful? I feel so freakin bad & she already said that she hasn't "had a home" in a while &amp; now I'm sure that's goin to make it a lil worse, ay? Plus there's not a place for her stuff in our house. There's no room for her in her own home. Well, I could leave some of her stuff in her closest, but woohoo she has a closet! (Is she gonna sleep there years from now?) But then there'd be no room for my stuff. Geez this is pretty cracked up, ay?   This dog, that isn't even ours, has been barking at a garbage bag for the last 15 minutes, seriously. I feel like shooting it... but that would be cruel. Bad thoughts! haha

       Beth says hi & that she has a really good book (it was her Dad's, but well, she likes to steal) &amp; she loves to eat & sleep it. Oh, &amp;  red  really looks like  or-ange ! haha Well it's a quarter til 1 in the mornin, woohoo. I'm bored. Ya know what? When I hug him I fit right under his chin. like perfect. what else would you want? Guess what? I watched Dirty Dancing Havanna Nights 2nite- I liked it ToNs. I still need to post those pics.

         Well here it is... the Redhead Remix of Roses! by Beth (co-writer me) inspired by um, just bout everything. (to the tune of Roses by Outkast! obviously, haha)  Laurel Lynn (Laurel Lynn). See Laurel Lynn, all the guys would say she's mighty fine (mighty fine), but mighty fine only got you somewhere one-third of the time, but the other quarter either got you cussed out or punched in the eye.  bridge: well dig this now, even tho (even tho) she needs a platnium calculator to multiply (to multiply) the time it takes to look inside and realize that red hair don’t care, care,&nbsp; c-c-c-c-care.  chorus x2: i know you'd like to think your hair is red, but lean a lil bit closer, see, red really looks like or-ange. yea, red really looks like or-ange.  Laurel Lynn (Laurel Lynn). she's the reason for the word red (red). well when we're speedin on the way to cynthiana and i'm gonna put my selt belt on cuz dad told me to. no i don't want to but i guess i have to so i won't die if we crash, crash, crash into a ditch. i'm not playin.  bridge  chorus x2  but she's bout half retarded, everyone likes her big booty. When I met her on her Harley, she was as bright as a red Crayolie. I said Laurel would you call me? She said it’s long distance from Mt. Olivet. I said Laurel, you sound like a giant eree-eree. Oh so you’re one of them penguins and you live in the zoo and you got red hair, too. Beth don’t like feet, 19 sexy-sweet. Brush your teeth, always floss! When you’re playin baseball wear your cleats. ow! hamburger meat. Ow! &nbsp;If you wanna scare me- Ow! Be a ghost wear a sheet. Ow! Don’t trick-or-treat. No! (no!) Now go on Kara Beth, my pooh cover is flawless. Regardless, Blankey wanna get involved with all them lawyers. And 80s tees and Zach Morris in a courtroom. Smokey don’t like forest fires, so FIRE ON YOU!  chorus x4  this thang x2: Qclub guy thinks I live in Mars. Laurel quit chasin cars. Redhead got ran over by a tax-i in new york, new york, new york.  crazy Beth. crazy betch. crazy Beth. crazy betch. crazy Beth. crazy betch. crazy Beth. Stitch. (crazy bitch.) Lilo and stitch. (Gullible Laurel.) Naked with eggs. (crazy braytch.) Ole’ crackin braytch. (wear that shirt.) A betch’s Beth. (frozen poptarts.) Just a bird… (stupid bitch) ate penis cake. (crazy trip.) Ole’ Steph loves beans. (crazy betch.) Ole’ Peter Rabbit. (crazy chocolate.) A big fat secret! (crazy shirt.) Just a tree...&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Being stupid is so much fun sometimes. Make sure to take my poll after you read this so you can tell me what you think! :) Me n Beth n Evette n Steph stayed the night at Brandon’s last nite and stayed up like almost all nite. I am the Scrabble Queen! lol We all had fun (of course) but it was def light outside when I went to sleep. oh well We went to the fair 2nite. I was alright. There were enough ppl there, of course not really the ppl (person) I want to see, but ain’t that the way it works, lol. I got to drive Sean's car for like a really long time, on a real road! lol I was so proud of myself it was super fun! I did good, too, you should be proud, mkay?&nbsp;We only ended up ridin one ride and we went through that Mummy thing, lol. I was actually scared at the beginning of it. Me n Beth started to go in it once but came back out cuz neither of us wanted to go in front, haha. I know we’re ‘tards. Does the song “The Good Stuff” bother you, too? I mean not really bother, but you know. Or maybe you don’t. It was worth a shot. oh I just remembered the other day we went to Food Lion and we saw Preston and he made me a 4sale sign on one of those MVP Bonus Buy signs lol. I taped it to my back. fun stuff, really. Gotta have fun in grocery stores, or the world is lost. And like 2 nites ago&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;came over here and hung out for a while (I got to drive! yeehaw! lol)&nbsp;Okay I’m tired and everybuddy’s goin to sleep on me so I’m gonna go jump and sit on them. Sianora.

        I wrote something almost everyday I was gone, so here it is!  July 1st  the city of Shaginaw, Michigan&nbsp;   I&nbsp;don’t feel like writing so here’s some memos & song lyrics I jotted down 2day:   *Shrimp, Shrimp, Shrimp… &amp; Mo’ Shrimp! (truck stop sign)  *when I go on a road trip we’re going to Yellow Springs, Oh. (where I saw a woman in a business suit carrying her shoes down the road… it‘s like a hippy town, fun stuff really) and Point Pleasant WVa. (moth man place). and I got the idea to go 2 strangers houses and ask to jump on their trampolines.  *“I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you.” Clint Black (Like the Rain)  *“Cuz I’m broken, when I’m lonesome, and I don’t feel right when you’re gone away.” Seether and Amy Lee (Broken)  *Sheryl Crow lyrics:  **“All I wanna do is have a lil fun before I die” (All I Wanna Do)  **“Jump in, let’s go. Lay back, enjoy the show. Everybody gets high, everybody gets low- these are the days when anything goes. Everyday is a winding road (I get a lil bit closer). Everyday is a faded sign (I get a lil bit closer). Everyday is a winding road (I get a lil bit closer, to feeling fine.)” (Everyday is a Winding Road)  **“This has been the best part of my losing streak.” (Leaving Las Vegas)  *I kicked a stone from Applebee’s to our hotel.  *I saw a wrecked Volkswagen Beetle with blood all over the inside.  *I watched the Spanish channel with mom ‘til Dean got mad and changed it.  *Had to take advil with bourbon water, mom’s orders. lol (my dad was drinkin bourbon and he left it sitting and fell asleep and mom thought it was water and told me to drink it to take advil, Nasty kids, very nasty.)   July 2nd  in Little Current   On the way back to the hotel from the restaurant me and Dad had an interesting topic of convo. I’ll set the scene for you: this guy was riding his bike past us and doing tricks and stuff and Dad recommended that I walk up to the bike guy and give him a 4-leaf clover… I was like right….. But that got him talking bout how I should live life to make memories- like just have meaningful moments with ppl (strangers, friends, anyone I guess). He said that making memories could be like an art form… I mean what if someone spent their life creating memories in ppl’s minds. Crazy idea, but I like it. Sharing moments with ppl is something like everyone likes at some time in their life- why not all the time? Ya know, no matter how much I say I hate him sometimes I just love him too much.   July 3rd  my little island   I saw the hottest guy EVER today at the dock. I’m guessing he was a bit old for me by the cases and cases of beer he loaded into his boat, but hey- a girl can dream! haha  Well I’m now posted on Iroquois island. Ya know, no matter how many times I’ve come here it doesn’t cease to amaze me… it’s just so beautiful. Dean and Dad have been fishing for at least 4 hours now and there’s not sign of them yet! They better get back before the sun goes down or they’ll be devoured by mosquitoes… they’re So thick here. omg here comes a boat pulling a boat very similar to our’s… haha I’m gonna laugh my ass off if that’s them! I think it is! hahaha… okay damnit, it’s not! grrrrr! haha Well I guess it's one of our neighbors for the week... hmmm... they don't look very excitin. Ya know I painted mom’s toenails 2day for the first time in her EnTiRe LiFe! Isn’t that crazy? Okay mom walked down to the dock cuz she thought it was Dean n Dad, well she came back up here and was like “Well I felt foolish.” and I was like, “why didn’t you turn around when you figured out it wasn’t them?” and she said “well I rushed down there and saw strangers, I wasn’t gonna rush back, they’d think I was weird.” I asked her what she said to them and she told them that the way they were towing something (which turned out to be a rubber inflatable thing) she thought it was her husband. At least I got some humor out of the situation. I have to pee now.   July 4th  some kind of fourth of July   Well today started out alright. I had weird dreams last night... ya know how ya wake up and go back to sleep  and you have continuation of the first dream? well that’s what was happenin except now I don’t understand how they connect, or which one was first~ they all followed the same theme. About Mike of course. bunches of people were in them at different times, except Beth (who was there the whole time). like: my ‘rents, Brandon, Dean, I don’t remember other people. They involved weird things like Beth writing on this big white wall (in green markers) things like “Laurel’s gay” and I got really pissed in my dream. But I remember me and Mike havin a long convo and feeling really good when I woke up but I don’t remember what we said. AnYwAyS... we all went fishing this morning and it started POURING down rain and lightnin and shit and so we anchored on this weird island and kinda stood there. Well, I was okay for the first half hour we were there... but in another hour my clothes (including my piece of shit rain jacket) were soaked and my whole body was wet. I was in a bitchy mood and didn’t hesitate to tell my dad just what a piece of shit that rain jacket was. When it let up, they wanted to fish more and I was like “Do you want me to pour buckets of water down your rain suit and see if you’re in the mood for fishing then?” We went back to the cabin. That ruined the rain for me forever... well at least for the rest of the week. I need a back massage. Last night before I went to sleep I was reading and the way the light is hanging in my room, I couldn’t see very well so Dean swung the beds around in my room~ while I was still in mine. It was FUN. haha Well I’m peeing “healthier” now~ don’t ask. Oh- Beth I heard that “Although we’ve come to the end of the road..” song today! haha 94.1 Moose FM! Yeah buddy! I also heard that “Hands” song by Jewel~ I forgot how much I loved it. It’s grrreat! Yea oh well time to dine.   July 5th  happy b-day Autumn!   The temperature today has been weird. This morning it was cold and rainy and by the afternoon it was warm enough for me 2 lay on the dock in my swimsuit. Not quite warm enough to actually swim, tho. haha Dad caught a bass today~ big enough to eat. I caught about a five inch one off the dock, haha. of course I let it go. I finally got to blow out my b-day candles today! Even though my b-day was like, what, 17 days ago? We didn’t have any candles at home when we celebrated my b-day... so when we were shopping for groceries to bring up here I saw candles and I thought if I got some and put them in the brownies mom planned on making that’d make up for it. I heard tons of good songs today. The song “I Will Remember You” by Sarah McLachlan is seriously exactly the way I feel a lot now. I forgot about that song. And I heard this new Nelly Furtado song- “Try” Its good and Norah Jones’ “Sunrise” I love her voice. Dean tried singin “My Heart Will Go On” It was great. haha Well its midnight and I’m tired- Adios!   July 6th   It’s rained off and on all day today, not too bad until like right now, though. It’s after 11 at night. We all went fishing from like 10-6 or something. Nobody really caught anything except Dean. He was really reelin ‘em in at one point. He caught 3 Pikes. None of them were really big enough to keep, but he kept the first one, it was real real close to 2 feet. Dad keeps saying I’m asleep and I’ve left the light on and I’m like geez how can I be asleep if I’m writing? And he’s like- you can write w/ your eyes closed? And I’m like you can’t even see me from where you are! GEEZ! We’re all goin to freeze to death in this cabin. I never remember it bein cold but I have 3 blankets on and I could sand another one. Oh, I just remembered something dad was talkin bout today. His friend, Mike Straw, used to talk about a guy who got a bumble bee sting on his dick and it “swelled up as big as a baseball bat.” haha I kinda doubt that’d ever happen, but talk about a 3rd leg. lol. Crazy, ay? You know some people claim lil’ kids are scared of everything but I think they’re too curious and well, dumb to know when to be scared. I know I was. I kinda miss that. I was never scared of spiders when I was younger... or bees, or much else, really. I wouldn’t want to be naive and innocent forever, but it definitely has its moments. Definitely...  &nbsp;   July 7th   Well I like just woke up and I had the coolest dream in the world last night. The beginning is kinda vague and weird... like I was in a gym (like in a school) and I don’t remember what I was doin but after while I noticed these white lions (like @ the Cinci Zoo) a lil’ ways down from me and they were like walking around and not paying any attention to me, but I was convinced they were gonna attack me. So there were these rooms and I locked myself into one and jus waited. Well my mom came to get me and got me out of the room and the lions still didn’t pay any attention to us so we just left. When we got outside somehow Beth was with us and her dad had come to get her. We were in our student parking lot but it was dark outside and there were these two girls in Shannon’s truck with him. They reminded me of those lesbian porn stars in Anger Management. And he had like met them at some support group but I don’t remember what it was called. I think it had something to do with killing ppl? Well, Beth went home and I was on this long road and everything was like hazy and gray and Evan was on it, too, but he was up a ways from me but we were facing each other and walking. I had my cell phone and he was like sending me all this these text messages but I have no clue what they said. Well then I think I was in Canada and my rents were with me and I kept using my cell phone in front of them and they didn’t care and they were gonna get me a better one. Well then there was an outside basketball court and Beth was supposed to be having a gym class there. I talked to her some but her instructor yelled @ me and I hadda leave. Then was the coolest part~ it was the last day of school and it was our school, but it was a million times better! I didn’t have to go to my classes I reckon cause I was just wanderin around the whole time and I went to the cafeteria, I think but it was like the middle school one with a stage and all and there were these girls up there and one of ‘em looked kinda Hawaiian. She was singin that song “Take It Easy”... ya know? And other girls were playin instruments and the girl would sing the song but make up verses in the middle about stuff goin on in the room and there were these other girls doin a tap routine... Leslie Preston, etc. lol. It was weird. Then I left and like went up the slope. Ya know, the hallway outside the gym, and there were people everywhere doin the tap thing and Mrs. Casey came up to them and was like what are you doing? And they told her and she was like I know, I’ve been doing it all day, too. It was the coolest school ever and it was a lot bigger and there were tons of people. I don’t know. Then it was supposed to be 4th block or something and I was gonna go to class to see what we were doin. So I went upstairs and a lot of people were leavin class so I went with them and I found Beth, Jen and Amanda and a buncha other people and we were goin to some assembly, I guess? And Amanda was talkin about how Kensi didn’t come to school because she would have made fun of her. Well we got to this place that looked like a big version of Jones’ gym/cafeteria (Mason Co.) and there were groups of people doing whatever they wanted so me and Beth went walkin around and I remember Clink bein there? And then I saw Kensi talkin to my mom or somethin. But there were people sellin stuff and we talked to this girl that looked like that girl on Degrassi (I can’t remember her name... Liberty I think?). Then Kensi was talkin to us and this guy came up to us and he was supposed to be famous like a guy from New Kids on the Block. Somehow we got in this really involved convo about love. There was this package for sell that was like a love kit I reckon and the guy threw it and it opened and somethin in it said VooDoo. So, the guy picked it up and Kensi gave him gum out of it. I don’t remember what they said but I got the fact that her and Rus had broken up and she was a totally different person. The guy left and I asked Kensi why her and Rus broke up and she said he was arrogant and she grew up. Earlier in the dream, I was sitting in the real cafeteria with a buncha guys and it looked like Straub’s cafeteria. (Mason Co.) and we were watchin TV. I think Abby was with me and we were talkin about Chad’s legs? And then me and her went to the auditorium and it was like rehearsal for our show last year and Tracy, Anna Kristin, and Kitty were onstage. Mrs. Franklin was showing us the arms for something. Then I left and I saw Mike and I think I kept walking and I saw John Turner and we talked then I kept walking and Mikey Harris slapped my ass or something and him and Scott were tryin to talk to me but I saw Josh Ecklar and went to talk to him and me and Nina ended up goin to his house? But then we had to go to Nina’s and her aunt was there and she was really mean so we went back to school. Anyways I know that was the longest pointless thing I’ve ever written but it was just so cool cuz our school was bigger and nobody cared what anybody else thought and we were pretty much nice to each other and it was just fun.   July 8th  Whoa Nelly! haha   Geez o pete o geez~ Dean wont stop rocking back and forth and staring at me and singing “Ring around the Rosie” all scary-like. Sometimes I don’t want to claim him. Ole’ Deano. haha! well I just had the biggest adventure of the week! We went to Nelly, this lake that’s on an indian reservation. It’s my favorite place in Canada. I have pictures from there. Dean wanted to climb over on top of all these rock hill things to take a picture and he wanted me to come so we set off. I have to say it was a bit rocky and kind of dangerous but of course fun! I have 2 more bug bites, tho. Oh and I lost my shoes like 3 times cuz I was wearing flip-flops! haha! I just feel so alive there. I could just stand and stare up at the sky and feel like I never had to move. It makes me feel like I can do whatever I want! haha I wrote my name in rocks to see if it would be there next year, prolly not, but? omg this is the funniest radio program I’ve heard in a long time. They’re discussing living in a city or a suburb. What the hell is the difference? This woman said Escalade like it was Escalad. (I cant stand people who talk with flat a’s) She said if the roof breaks she’d have to move cause she doesn’t know how to fix anything! wtf?! lol oh well. I’ve been reading the “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood!” Its long but I love it. I want to live in it. It’s complicated but I need that. I need some things to go wrong so I can appreciate it when everything is right. I want to live in the deep south and have close friends and get arrested , get talked about and not give a damn, have kids, cause controversy... I want to live! I mean like really live! I just haven’t found a job that fits in w/ that. So I don’t think I will. Work, I mean. I’ll be an old fashioned mom. Have a 2-story house w/ a finished basement and a huge lawn w/ big trees and a volleyball net and a lake w/ a dock and maybe a canoe! lol! A big porch and parties every month. I don’t mean trashy parties, I mean dress up and dance parties (open bar, of course. If someone is gonna write a book about me I would give them a hell of a lot to write about. My life might look nice and simple and plain but I’m gonna surprise the hell out of people. Shake things up a bit, ay? Beth let’s find hubbies after college and go live in some southern state and upset some little town. lol I’ve got big plans for such a short period of time. Maybe I could just stay here to live and do just as well. Kentucky is fab. and I’m serious... Well our feast of green beans and tuna sandwiches is FiNiShEd so I'll quit my rambling...for now! Smooches!   Back from dinner...Deanie tried to say his stomach gets big when he eats. That was good for a laugh. lol Back to what I was talkin bout earlier (kinda)- I want family dinners, a dishwasher, someone to clean the house (maybe)...I’ll do laundry and cook and raise kids and make fun, that should be enough, lol! I think I can do it! Oh and one of the most important things is that my husband is gonna think I'm sexy! No matter how old I am. Things just get better with time, honey. I cant stand men who talk down to their wives, they should be shot. My man will appreciate what he has. ‘Cause I’ll be worth it. But I won’t put up with shit. Laurel Mallory will not put up with a man’s shit!... I take pride in being difficult... no matter how bad it hurts me sometimes.   July 10th  is there a point to Diet Sierra Mist???   This is my 2nd day on the train 2 NYC. It's nice I guess. It took me a lil while to get used 2 the constant rocking, but I'm good now. I'm in the state of New York, but I still have a few hours before I get to NYC. These are really comfortable seat, the food is tolerable, and I've seen four hot guys! yippee! haha The first one was at the train station yesterday- he worked there- and he reminded me of someone but I couldn’t figure out who. The 2nd one was on the train yesterday, playing cards with some lil kids. I heard him say his hat was from Australia and I think that's why I found him attractive... the dangerous type! haha The third one worked at the train station in Toronto- blonde hair. He was nice... nice smile. The fourth one was kinds of unexpected... I said “Excuse me” and he said “Certainly” how adorable is that?! haha There was also this guy that smiled at me in the eatin car but he was kinda scary, actually... oh well I’m sure they’re all a tad old for me. The guy selling food is rude and I really, really don’t like him. Screw him and the horse he rode in on! haha (DS) but he gave me a free water, so? lol AnYwAyS- Sheryl Crow is my fuckin idol, kids. I’ve even heard she’s dating Lance Armstrong... sexy- but I thought he had a wife? Every single song she ever sang is absolutely fab. (That reminds me, you can get the cutest lil bottle of Absolut on the train. haha) I’ll put links to my fav Sheryl songs on this entry @ home. I wish I’d get to NYC so I can shake my booty, and truck it back home (w/ a National champs trophy, hopefully...) I miss y’all! Beth- I’m wearin my indian choker today! Yesterday I met this woman named Natalie raveling to Toronto w/ her hubby and baby girl (who was adorable!). She was really nice and reminded me of one of my best friends from elementary school- Elizabeth Smith. (Everybody gets high, everybody gets low- these are the days when anything goes...)   oh and I figured out the answer to the not-really-a-question of ‘chase what makes your heart flutter, even if it hurts’ or whatever ya know... I say ‘if it makes you happy, it can’t be that bad’. (a lil obvious help from Sheryl on that one!) Like any of that really matters anymore anyway. It’s not like I think bout that 24/7... only about a minute a day now (hmm...). That’s enough time for it to kill me, tho. I thought I was over alla that... but it hit me upside the head out of left field again. (lol) Sorry for being so fuckin stupid. (That was an apology to myself). I’m too strong to let stupid shit get to me. I have to keep reminding myself of that.   *Make Sure Y’all Look @ These Sheryl Lyrics!:   The Difficult Kind  urlLink http://www.letssingit.com/sheryl-crow-the-difficult-kind-ld52t76.html &nbsp; best line: “I swear I can see you... coming up the drive. & there ain’t nothing like regret, to remind you you’re alive.” *chorus*   All I Wanna Do  urlLink http://www.letssingit.com/?http://www.letssingit.com/sheryl-crow-all-i-wanna-do-4jbgfh6.html &nbsp; best line: “All I wanna do is have a lil fun before I die.”   Everyday is a Winding Road  urlLink http://www.letssingit.com/?http://www.letssingit.com/sheryl-crow-everyday-is-a-winding-road-jk53v89.html &nbsp; best line: “I used to ride with a vending machine repairman.

        I think I am gonna go crazy. And that's okay with me. don't know where that came from. I really want you all to look at this song because I love it and I don't know I just started singin it the other day while I was mowing and I have NO clue how it got into my head... I think I was saving it somewhere back in there for some random time. But it's great. It's called Long Day by Matchbox 20 so go to  urlLink http://www.letssingit.com/?http://www.letssingit.com/matchbox-20-long-day-d7zqxz7.html  to read it! We start school tomorrow and it sucksssssssss very much. bad stuff. also while you're on Letssingit.com you should look up Pedro the Lion they're super. they like sex a lot, but other than that they're allllll right. I went to Louisville the other day to babysit my cousin Max geez he is 5 and he drives me insane! I have some pics tho he's adorable i'll post them later. we went to this art openin thing at this place called the cinderbloc i think but there was the HOTTEST GUY I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE there. geez really and he dressed good, too. i don't mean preppy i mean like good i dunno. i shoulda stayed around i'm he mighta got drunk and hit on me and that woulda be fun but ya know he was prolly like 20 so it'd be bad news! hmmm... atleast i think it would be, I haven't decided yet. lol I wanted to see the man Dan in Louisville (he lives there) but I was too busy so i reckon i will go to the ky fair. how bout it? good stuff. i like the word stuff. it's so i dunno good. okay nevermind i sound like a complete idiot. but hey i only am sometimes, outside of the classroom when i get to think bout other things besides education. book smart, commom sense dumb. that's me! i reckon that's not exactly something i should be braggin bout, ay? lol I'm really tired. i woke up at 6 this mornin to practice for school, like gettin up and all that. i had dance from 10-5 and i don't think i'll be walkin very lady like tomorrow at school. i'll prolly be limpin. but it's all good in the hood cuz i have dance for 3 hrs tomorrow. no pain, no gain, chico. it's so weird to be thinkin bout goin to school cuz i haven't been for so long... but i better be catchin some zzzz's if i expect to make it thro the first day. geez that's promising.
