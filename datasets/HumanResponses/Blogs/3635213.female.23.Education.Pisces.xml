      Today at about 8am I was called by Coppell ISD's human resource lady.  I GOT A JOB AT LAKESIDE ELEMENTARY AS A SECOND GRADE TEACHER!!!!!  Yea!  I will be signing my papers on June 30th at 3:00.  God really has blessed me with this job because it is perfect.  It's only 5 miles away from my apartment, there seems to be a great team of young teachers, and it's in second grade (my favorite!)  I can't wait!

      So I recieved a call from Coppell ISD about a possible teaching job at  urlLink Lakeside Elementary .  I am a little nervous because of my past three interviews being flops.  I am excited though because they are offering me a Second or Kindergarten position.  I would LOVE to teach second grade again.  Say a little prayer for me and hopefully I will get the best job for me.  I'll post a message when I know the verdict about my job.

      So I was simply on the phone with my dad and I had an itch on my tummy.  I simply itched it when I realized I felt something.  I looked down and low and behold, there it was.... A bug... And I brushed at it a few times when I realized... IT WAS NOT COMING OFF!  I got all scared and said, "Daddy I'm coming over because I have a tick!"  and hung up.  I scooted down the road to my house and there dad proceeded to begin the tic-ectamy as he says.  The tic quickly came off and about ten minutes later I calmed down.  Sigh... What a traumatic event!  I think I picked it up on my nature walk with the kids at the River Legacy Center in Arlington (where I am volunteering for some of the summer.  urlLink http://www.riverlegacy.org/  )  It's all over now and I'm tic-less.    FYI. Tick - Any of numerous small bloodsucking parasitic arachnids of the family Ixodidae, many of which transmit febrile diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease.  Any of various usually wingless, louselike insects of the family Hippobosciddae that are parasitic on sheep, goats, and other animals.   No wonder I was scared!

       So... you know how I was cut... WELL... I just found out that Johnson Elementary hired TWO NEW SECOND GRADE TEACHERS!!!! So... I am not too happy with them. This basically means they could have hired me back and left me in the same place that I was last year. This is okay though because I think Coppell will be a new and better experience. I just want to STAY somewhere for more then a year and really get to know the staff, children, parents, and my team without having to just leave them ALL at the end of the year.     sigh... crazy Southlake Carroll ISD...

      I've gotten into my classroom and things are being unpacked and placed in a certian spot. (However I know I will move it about 100 times to try different arrangements) I have chosen a theme, Bears and patriotic. It's similar to my past room, however I have MORE bear things this year!  As of now I'm contemplating different things to do to my room... I was debating about making a cave for the reading center, like one the kids would be sitting in while they read. I was wanting to have stalagtites and stalagmites to help make it even more educational. Besides I figure bears sleep in caves so it would be a nice connection. I also was thinking about what all I need for each center. It's amazing how many things you can come up with for kids to learn with. Anything from different games or manipulatives to neat ways to organize materials for kids to want to work with it.  I'm very excited because I have a key for my room and one for the outside of my school so I can come anytime I want to work on it! (o:  When I was going through my old things from Johnson I saw things from my past class and almost cried cause I miss them and think they were great. It was neat because I knew all of their personalities and remembered happy memories with them.  I guess I just can't wait for school to start and get new kiddos and memories...

      Okay so I got the key to my new classroom yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I was able to move my boxes and such from&nbsp;my parent's&nbsp;garage to the new classroom.&nbsp; Dave was kind enough to help with his truck.&nbsp; It took a quick two trips and now everything is there.&nbsp;   The problem is though, that I have to set it up!&nbsp; I'm soooo excited about it.&nbsp; I am doing the GT training through Carroll ISD (since I am still being paid by them and because mom does the training)&nbsp;in the mornings so I can only work in the afternoon/evening time at the school.&nbsp; By the way, the GT training is interesting because mom tends to single me out sometimes and tell stories that I have heard about 100 times in my life.&nbsp; It is still a great training, don't get me wrong and I'm definately not bored and learning A LOT!  Back to the classroom topic - I'm&nbsp;nervous because this time last year my classroom was all nicely set up and this year I'm scrambling to even find my room in this new school.&nbsp; I've decided that my "theme" will be bears!&nbsp; I had sort of a patriotic theme last year and this year it's more of a bear/apple theme.&nbsp; So, if you find anything bear/apple-ish, let me know!&nbsp; (o:&nbsp; I suppose that is all the news for now.&nbsp; More classroom news to come!&nbsp; (oh and I will try to post great class stories - with no names of course - but there always seems to be something good to laugh about in elementary school)

       Saturday July 24th I gave Laura a surprise Birthday party.&nbsp; She turned 23.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura had never had a surprise party before so this was a great experience for her.&nbsp; She had NO IDEA that it was going to happen, which is amazing cause Laura is the kind of person to find out about EVERYTHING.&nbsp; She could shake a present and tell you what it was or just guess about a place that you are taking her by using logic and reason.&nbsp; Her boyfriend Justin was in charge of getting her to Shelly and Matt's house.&nbsp; He ended up just blind folding her and telling her, "Oh I'm on the freeway." and "Oh I just stopped to trick you."&nbsp; When she got there she was very surprised!&nbsp; She loved it!&nbsp; We opened presents, ate cake, and played games.&nbsp; I used the free  urlLink  evite   site to send out the invitations.&nbsp; What a success!&nbsp;

      So Dave was gone from 7-17 through 7-20 (today!)  He was in Atlanta staying at an "exciting" Red Roof Inn.  He was actually very bored being stuck in the room for three days straight.  Anywho, he was there because he had an interview with Atlantic Southeast Airlines to be a CRJ (regional jet) pilot.  He is very excited because he went to both phases of the interview and flew the flight sim better then a pilot with more hours then him.  We are all crossing our fingers and praying for him in hopes that this is the job God wants for him.  He returned today and showed me all of the things he had to do in his interview.  It's amazing how much I don't know about being a pilot.  Yea! for Dave's great interview and we'll see what happens...

      Today Rocky turns 1 year old! I sang to him two times in the morning and one time at night. He just looked at me like I was strange... Weird. (o: I also baked him 5 homemade (from a dog biscuit mix) dog treats. He loves them! Also I made 10 more for him to give to his close dog buddies. He gave one to Pascal (dog friend that lives down stairs), Rosco and Princess (my friend Shelly's dogs), Jedi (his cousin), Cosi, Lexi, and Kandy (his second cousins), Sassy (Laura's mom's dog), and Roxy (his girlfriend that is a rotwiler that lives across the complex).   He is a happy pup!

      So it's summer time.  If I remember correctly, during the school year I was DYING for summer time.  Well I realize now that there is no structure in the summer and all I want is to be in my new classroom setting up things or teaching my new kiddos.    I completed my Exit interview with Carroll ISD, which consisted of me filling out one sheet of paper about where I want my last paychecks sent and when.  It was "thrilling"... and Dr. Citty asked me, "Is there anything else you'd like to say?"  I thought for a second and said, "No."  I realized later that it was true.  There was nothing I wanted to say to the district that cut me due to financial shortfalls and Robin Hood.  All I know is that I did my best and what did that get me?  "Let go."  It's a hash reality to this wacko world.    Needless to say I'm happy about my new job and really wanting to get started.

      The Big July fourth celebration was held on July 3rd at John and Michelle's house.  It was a great time for all.  I however was not too happy about the part when John and Patrick realized it had been too long since they last tickled and ganged up on me!  So they proceeded to do so until I yelled, "Hey that is why you have wives and babies!"  Then Lydia so cleverly asks, "Patrick who are these other wives and what babies?"  :-P  Don't you love Watts' humor, hehe.    Other highlights were the pictures of the family that were like taking wedding pictures, "Okay now the mom and dad and Reganne, okay now the grandparents, okay now the bridesmaids, oh wait!"  ;-)    Also the fact that there were FOUR Daves on the FOURTH.  Dave Watts, Dave McKinney, Dave Patrick Watts, and Dave Greene.    There was a fabulous manicurist and diaper changer, Kaye, who did a wonderful pedicure with red polish and stars.  I hope she gets started on her new invention she was thinking about making.  (o;  It was a great time for family, puns, and fun!  (o:  Today I have another little celebration with my friends: Shelly and Matt, Laura and Justin, and Dave.  We will be cooking out and swimming at Shelly and Matt's house.

      It was very exciting to finally meet the parents and the kiddos that I will have this year at "Meet the Parents" last night.  They were all very sweet and welcoming.  I even got a Starbucks gift card already.  Yeah for nice, thoughtful parents!  All day before meet the parents I was working hard to get my room all set up.  We (the second grade team) just received the class lists the afternoon before so we had to work hard all day to label everything.    Other then that, I've been watching the opening to the Olympics, playing with Rocky, and counting the days till Dave gets back.  Stay tuned for more to come about school...  **Due to privacy laws I will never mention a child's name**

      After many meetings, trainings, and hours spent working on my room, I'm almost ready for meet the parents Thursday night.  I'm excited and nervous at the same time.  My classroom has really started to come together and I am starting to feel a little more "at home" when I'm there.  It's still a little strange feeling.    I got a  urlLink palm pilot  today!  Yes Coppell ISD supplies their K-2 teachers with these because they have a great Assessment program on them that helps teachers to organize and monitor data about the students' reading needs throughout the year.  It is interesting because as teachers go, I seem to have a high intellegence in the computer world.  The other teachers were struggling to know the terms and work the buttons while I was jumping around in programs and figured out how to "beam" information to other palms way before they even taught us how.  I bragged about how BOTH my brother and his wife have palm PHONES.  The other teachers were in "a little awe" with that info.  Needless to say I'm excited about the new technology to play with.  I'm planning on finishing the major room things tomorrow... I hope. That's it for now!

      Dave left for his family's Alaskan cruise this morning.  I took him to the airport at 4:30am - too early for me!  The funny part about that though is the phone call I got about 30 minutes after I dropped him off.  It was Dave and he said, "You won't believe what I did"... I said, "What?"  (thinking oh no, he must have forgotten something)... he said, "My flight was supposed to leave from Love Field, not DFW."  This is coming from a newly hired pilot, airplane lover, who knows TONS about airports and flying, and he is super organized.  I felt so bad for him, but it was just so funny.  Well it turns out he was able to get on a flight from DFW around the same time but wow... poor Dave.  I'm just glad he was able to get a flight there and then head on to California on time.    From what I understand, Dave was able to tour San Fransisco because he got there so early.  He sounded like he had a great time from the message he left me.  He also called to say that he was ON THE BOAT at one point.  He is going on a  urlLink Crystal Cruise  because his dad works for them.  I was excited to see that I will be able to see a view from his ship every once and awhile on it's  urlLink webcam .  I will keep you updated and in about 12 days I bet that Dave will have quite a lot to say about his trip in his blog.

      Earlier today Dave recieved a call from  urlLink Atlantic Southeast Airlines  and was given an offer for a first officer position. He's soooo excited. Now he has to go to Atlanta for about 2-3 months to get trained. After that he will be back in DFW (most likely.) Yeah for the happy news! I didn't have any doubt really because he's an excellent pilot.
