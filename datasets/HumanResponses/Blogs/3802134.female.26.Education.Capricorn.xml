      As I mentioned in an earlier post, I'm on summer break right now.  The school that I work for has a summer session so I have two weeks off now, six weeks of summer school, and then two more weeks before the regular school year starts.  (The short story re: my job is that I'm a teacher's aide at a school for emotionally disturbed kids.  The long story can be found in the post entitled "Heigh-Ho, Heigh Ho, It's Off To Work I Go...")  For the most part, I really love my job.  I love working with kids, I love feeling like I'm providing them with something they really need (love, attention, and affection among many other needs), and I enjoy 98% of the people I work with.  The 2% I don't enjoy are in the administration and perhaps I'll write about them some other time.  For now, I'll just say that they suck a lot.  One thing that is tough about my job though, atleast for me, is that it's very difficult to disengage from.  I get really attached to the kids, and even when we're not in session, I think about them and worry about them.  I realize that we have a lot of influence over them, but sometimes I think I overemphasize our influence in my own mind. Two kids in my class graduated from the program on the last day of the year, and I've thought about them a lot the last few days.  The first one is Ricky*.  Ricky, 11, is absolutely, no questions asked, my favorite kid that I've worked with at this program.  He was in my class for two years, and I absolutely adored him from day one.  He was far from the perfect child.  Getting him to do any kind of academic work, especially if it involved writing, was a nightmare.  He often started the morning cranky and tired, screaming and yelling, before he settled into his groove.  He was a total disaster if he was off his meds - literally running around the room and bouncing off the walls.  (And I assure you, I am using the word "literraly" properly.  Misuse of the word "literally" is one of my biggest grammatical pet peeves of which there are many.  But I digress.)  Ricky, however, was also bright, funny, and strangely insightful for his age (which was 11 at the time of graduation).  He could carry on a conversation about anything, and sometimes I forgot I wasn't talking to an adult.  He sat in the desk right next to mine so we interacted a lot.  I have never met a kid who can talk as much as Ricky.  Most of the time, it didn't even matter if anyone was listening (and I admit a few times, I wasn't).  He could turn the answer to a yes or no question into a fifteen minute story.  Example:  Me: Hey, Rick.  Did you do your homework last night?  Rick: (turning in his desk to face me)  Well, when the bus dropped me off yesterday, my dad was waiting at the bus stop for me.  He said, "Hey, Rick, do you wanna go see a movie?"  And I said, "Sure, what movie?"  And he said, "I don't know, what do you want to see?"  And I said, "How about Scooby Doo 2?"  And he said, "Okay."  So we got right in his truck - I didn't even go inside the house - and we went to see the movie.  It was kind of dumb, but kind of funny in some parts too.  After the movie was over, Dad said, "Hey, you wanna get some ice-cream?"  And I said, "Yeah, okay."  So we went to get ice-cream.  He got a sundae with Rocky Road and caramel sauce - I tried it but I don't really like caramel that much.  I got a waffle cone with a scoop of chocolate fudge and a scoop of mint chocolate chip.  I really wanted peanut butter fudge, but they were out of it.  It was good anyway.  So then we went back home and it was already way past my bedtime.  Me: So that's a no?  Ricky: Yeah.  And although it may seem like an exaggeration, the above is an actual conversation that I had with him, almost verbatim.  Quite simply, I love him to death.  Ricky plays his cards pretty close to his chest emotionally.  He's not affectionate at all, and he hates being touched.  Even if you just patted him on the back, he'd jerk away from you.  He would never dream of telling you he liked you, or enjoyed being with you.  Just not his style.  But he made so many improvements in the two years I had him.  He went from flatly refusing all assignments, to doing them with a lot of help and a lot of begging and pleading, to doing them somewhat independently with very little prodding.  He got along amazingly well with the other kids, all of whom are very difficult to co-exist with.  We eventually came to depend on him to stand next to the kid no one else wanted to be near in line, or work with the person no one wanted to partner with, or wait while we took care of the more demanding kids.  He came a long way.  Every year the agency does a client survey, where people come in and interview the kids, and they just ask them about the classes and their staff and what they like and dislike about the school.  After Ricky was interviewed last year, the interviewer came up and said to me and the teacher, "I just had to tell you this.  Ricky was being pretty uncooperative, shrugging and avoiding questions, when he finally said, 'Okay!  I hate to admit it, but I really like my class AND my teachers.'"  When his counselor and the program director sat down with him and told him that he was going to be moving to a new program at the end of the year, he crossed his arms and said, "I don't care what you people say, I'm NOT LEAVING!"  In the end, he went without any fuss, but I could watch him leave knowing that we had a positive influence on his life.  He came a long way, he liked us, and I know that, even if he doesn't remember names and faces, years from now he'll be able to look back on his days in our program as positive ones.  The other child that graduated was Matt.  Matt, also 11, was the opposite of Ricky in almost every way.  I came into the class knowing that the teacher and his counselor didn't like him, and I was determined that I was going to be the one to swoop in and save the day.  I've always had a history of loving the kids that other people considered difficult (ask anyone in my church in Birmingham about Trey), and I figured I, as a new person, would come in fresh and ready to understand him.  Yeah, it didn't work out that way.  Matt is the one kid I've ever worked with - not just in this job but in ANY job - that I can honestly say I did not like.  He was uncooperative, he was difficult to get along with, he purposely instigated the other kids and then lied about his part in the problem with they responded.  He lied about EVERYTHING, whether it mattered or not, and he was good at it.  He was a cute kid - blonde haired, blue eyed, big grin - but you couldn't even enjoy that because he tried to play it up to keep himself out of trouble.  The school nurse once asked me to give her one positive thing about Matt (after three days of giving him meds at school, she was already grasping for straws), and I couldn't think of ANYTHING!  How terrible is that?!  Matt just hit all my buttons.  He was definitely smart enough to catch up and get on grade level, but he was SO lazy.  He just didn't see the importance of working hard at anything.  Plus, if he didn't like what you were saying, he just flatly ignored you.  I HATE that!  I'd rather have a kid totally freak out on me and scream and yell than pretend that he can't hear me.  All the adults that dealt with Matt were glad to hear he was leaving, we counted down the days, we talked about how the chemistry in our class would be so much better without him.  I mean, yeah, we gave him the going away party and the little gifts and all that stuff, but I know in my heart that it wasn't the same.  Ricky got a "We're really going to miss you" farewell and Matt got a "Good riddance" farewell.  He always said nice things about us and the school, but I can't help but feel that we failed him big time.  I keep thinking, maybe if I'd just listened a little more, or been a little more patient, or given him a little more help, maybe things would've turned out differently.  The really depressing thing is that, between the two kids, it was really Matt that NEEDED more.  Ricky definitely had his share of problems, especially at first, but while his home life is unconvential to say the least,** it is somewhat intact.  He's one of the few kids I've worked with who talks about home in an almost completely positive way, and his complaints are the usual kid complaints.  Watching him interact with his family at the awards ceremony (our annual end of the year bash) it was clear that he loves his family and his family loves him.  That can definitely not be said about Matt.  His parents are divorced and neither seems to particularly like him most of the time.  It sort of reminds me of a couple who decides that what they really need is a puppy.  So they go out and buy the puppy, and at first everything's great.  He's cute, he's fun, and they wonder how they ever lived without him.  But then things change - the puppy starts to grow some, he's not so cute, he eats a lot, and man, he's a lot of work to take care of.  So the couple starts ignoring the dog, and the dog gets that sad, neglected look about him.  Only in this case, the couple had a baby who grew into a sad, neglected little boy.  Intellectually, I KNEW that Matt behaved the way he did because the only time he got any real attention at home was when he was in the way or causing problems, and I KNEW his parents were not role-modeling a particularly strong work ethic, and I KNEW his parents were mean and unhelpful to each other, even where their kids were concerned, but I just couldn't make it connect to how I treated Matt.    I know things like this happen.  No program is going to be perfect for every child and every family.  Personality conflicts are going to happen.  Just because we didn't always provide Matt with what he needed, doesn't mean NO one will.  But it still bothers me, and I'm just not really sure what to do with that.  *The kid's names have been changed due to confidentiality issues.  Everything else is true. **Ricky's unconventional home-life:  His sister, her fiance, and their baby live with him.  His parents are divorced but they both still live with him too.  His mother's significant other, a cross-dresser who goes by Lizzie, lives with them.  Ricky was trying to explain Lizzie to a couple of the kids one day and Danny, at age 12 already the most hateful little homophobe I've ever met, said with as much disgust as he could muster, "You mean he's GAY?!?!?  That's gross!"  Ricky, either missing or choosing to ignore Danny's tone said very factually, "Actually, he's bisexual."  That's where I cut the converstation off, but I have to admit to laughing at it.  Now playing: U2 (album: War, track: Like a Song) Now reading: Still plugging along in  Wolves of the Calla , and things are really picking up.  I always get off to a slow start with The Dark Tower books for some reason.  Also started  My Sister's Keeper .

      I had to get up to take my dear, sweet husband to the bus at 6:45 this morning.  The plan was to go back to bed afterwards since I'm in the middle of a two-week break, but I can't get back to sleep which is unusual for me.  So I'm wasiting time and doing a getting to know you type post.  Since I don't really want a big, long profile, I'll answer some of the profile questions here instead.  Hey, I got nothing better to do.  Interests (in no particular order): reading, writing, scrapbooking, wasting time on the computer (obviously), listening to music, watching movies  About me: I was born during a blizzard in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  I'm the third of four kids, the only girl.  When I was but a babe, my family relocated to Birmingham, Alabama.  I spent the next fifteen years or so plotting my escape from the clutches of the deep south, but now that I've actually accomplished that, I'm strangely sentimental about all things southern.  I currently live in Buffalo, NY with my husband of four and a half years, Mark.  Mark grew up here, and almost all of his family is here (six siblings, five siblings-in-law, fifteen nieces and nephews, one parent, and way too many aunts, uncles, and cousins to count).  It was a bit of a change, but I really like it here.  Buffalo is a nice mid-sized city.  The section that we live in has all the comforts of small-town living but is still close to big city things like museums, theater, and most importantly, pro sports teams, all things that Birmingham was sadly lacking in.  I would say I'm pretty close to my family.  I have three brothers (John, Chris, and Lee in descending order), and although I might complain about them sometimes, we never had the adversarial relationships that some kids have with their siblings.  John and Chris are eleven and ten years older than me, respectively, and Lee is about two and a half years younger than me.  Now that we're spread out geographically, we stay in touch mostly via email and I also pound on Lee in our fantasy baseball league, and I would consider them all friends which is pretty special.  My dad died of a massive heart attack when I was four so my mom had to pick up a lot of extra slack and did so amazingly.  Looking back now I truly have no idea how she did everything she had to do, on the salary she did it, with the time contstraints she had, after the emotional loss she went through.  I always thought I had a good appreciation for all she's done, but the older I get, the more amazed I am.  I've been married for not quite five years, and I can't imagine life without Mark.  How you pick up and move on after suddenly losing your husband of sixteen or so years is beyond me.  I know there must've been times when she had doubts and when her faith wavered, but she never let us see them, and it's because of her that I have the faith in God that I do.  She's great.  Favorite movies (again, no particular order):   Field of Dreams  and  The Rookie  - These are my favorite sports movies.  I've always loved baseball the best of all professional sports, and I'm one of those sappy "baseball is America and family" people.  Also, I love Dennis Quaid.   Bringing Up Baby  and  Arsenic and Old Lace  - Cary Grant's best movies.  I'm also one of those "movies were so much better back then" people.   Singin' in the Rain  - A classic.  I could watch this movie over and over.  I  have  watched this movie over and over.   The Great Escapep  - This is another great movie that really holds up to repeat viewings.  It's just a great story, full of interesting characters.  Also, I love Steve McQueen.   Witness  - Once upon a time, I loved and adored Harrison Ford.  What has happened to you, dear, sweet Harrison?  Do you realize how long it's been since you made a good movie?  I love the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies, but this is easily my favorite of his - action, romance, comedy, it's got it all.  The scene where they dance in the barn is one of the most romantic of all time.   The Shawshank Redemption  - This movie is on TV ALL THE TIME, and I still sit and watch to the end every time I come across it.  It's got a lot of great moments.  In fact, when we first got our TiVo, I tested the pausing and rewinding of live TV by watching the last five minutes or so of this movie over and over and over.   The Muppet Movie  and  Beauty and the Beast  would be my favorite kids movies.  Oh, and  Mary Poppins .  That's ten, and although a couple of those might change depending on my mood, most of them are pretty good steady, choices.  If you asked me to give you my top ten tomorrow, I think you'd get a pretty similar list.  Favorite Music: Another tough category.  I like a lot of random styles and songs, but I'll try and break this down a little.  People Whose CD's I Always Buy Without Sampling: Steven Curtis Chapman, U2, Randy Stonehill, and when he was still alive, Rich Mullins.  Short list, but I don't have a huge disposable income, okay? Other people I really, really like or have been listening to a lot lately : Third Day, Vince Gill, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, The Beach Boys, Lyle Lovett, Jars of Clay, and Paul Simon.  Favorite songs would really be a better category for me in the music department, but that's one I'd have to think about pretty hard.  Maybe another day.  Favorite books:  Ugh.  The hardest category yet.  I love books and will read just about anything.  I can't pick favorites without really, really thinking about it so I'll just list some of the ones I read recently and liked:   Wizard and Glass  and  Wolves of the Calla  (which I'm currently reading) by Stephen King,  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time  by Mark Haddon,  The Time Traveler's Wife  by Audrey Niffenegger,  Screening Party  by Dennis Hensley,  Last Days of Summer  by Steve Kluger,  Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film  by Peter Biskind, and absolutely ANYTHING by Dennis Lehane.  Seriously, if it's possible to read too much, I do.  Okay, that's all for now.  I think I've bored myself back to sleep!  Now playing: "Wild Horses (acoustic)" by U2 Now reading:  Wolves of the Calla  by Stephen King

      Okay, so I already have a livejournal, but I wanted to comment on my little brother's blogger journal, and I had to register to do that.  And I kinda like the templates here.  So I might double post for a while and see which service I prefer.  For now, here's an entry that I originally wrote over at livejournal.  It seemed like a good one to start with since I probably will be talking about my job a lot.  Originally written and posted on January 1, 2004"  I have a feeling I'll be writing about my job a lot so I thought it might help if I explained what exactly my job *is*. This isn't as easy as it seems, so bear with me for a while.  I work at a school for emotionally disturbed kids. "Emotionally disturbed" covers a lot of ground but includes pretty much any kind of impairment that disrupts a child's or adolescent's academic and/or developmental progress, and family and/or interpersonal relationships.  In layman's terms, these kids are messed up something awful. Our program is classified as Day Treatment which is the most intensive program available that allows a child to remain in his home. If he comes to us and doesn't make any progress, he goes into residential care which means he no longer lives with his family.  Most kids come to us after their public school system has decided that it has no friggin' idea what to do with them due to extremely low academics or behavioral problems. For most of our kids, it's some of each. A lot of the kids finally get the boot after physically going after a staff or peer (sometimes succesfully, sometimes not). My first week at work, one of the kids very calmly told me that he was at our school because he got mad at his counselour and then went after her with a pair of scissors. Oh, did I mention that this kid was all of NINE at the time?  So the place where I work IS a school. People get confused about that when I try to explain what I do. There are some differencs between us and a regular school though.  Because of the extreme behaviors, all the classes are set at an 8 student maximum. Each classroom has atleast two staff at all times, a teacher and a classroom aide. Classroom aide is my position, but I'll get into that more in a second. Because of the low number of students, each classroom is usually a couple grades combined - 1st and 2nd grade together, 3rd and 4th grade together, etc. This is also helpful because a lot of the kids are at different levels in different subjects. For example, a kid may be on grade level in math but work below grade level in reading. Our program goes from 1st and 2nd grade all the way up to 11th and 12th grade.   Mixed in with those six classes are three IEP classes. IEP stands for Individualized Educational Plan. These kids are the kids who are waaay behind academically. Officially, IEP means that they are sort of on their own track as far as learning goes. They're not expected to move from grade level to grade level in the span of an academice year and may not earn a high school diploma before they have to leave the program at 21. Unofficially, these are kids that will most likely NEVER be on grade level, never go to college, never be able to hold down more than a basic job, and in some cases, never live on their own. As the IEP kids get older, there's less focus on academics and more focus on life skills - reading and writing, balancing a checkbook, handling money, job interview skills, interpersonal skills, that kind of stuff. Many of the IEP kids have borderline IQs. I work in the youngest IEP class.  In addition to the numerous behavior and learning disorders, most of the kids come from less than stellar homes. A lot of the families are poor. Almost all of the kids are in single parent homes. Most have seen numerous remarriages and divorces, and a steady rotation of adult males, none of whom stick around for very long. The kids I've worked with in a year and half have witnessed or been the victim of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and verbal abuse. Many have siblings or parents in jail, a few are involved in gang activity. A frightening number of them suffer from general neglect. I once heard kids like this described as ghosts in their own homes and that fits some of my kids perfectly - not only does no one care about them, no one even SEES them unless they're in the way. They don't exist at home.  As you might imagine, this can cause problems for us. Most of the kids come in hating school. They don't like adults, they've never had any reason to trust anyone or expect that anyone might be interested in them or want to help them. So they often end up mimicing the behaviors they hate so much - they scream, they swear, they hurl insults, ones that they know are going to hit you hard. They throw things, they break things, they sometimes even lash out at you physically and push or shove or kick or scratch. They can be really, really nasty kids.  But eventually most of them realize that you ARE interested in them and you DO want to help them, and they come around. The swearing and the insulting and the fits still happen, of course - those behaviors are rooted pretty deeply. They haven't had much else demonstrated to them. They do start to open up a little bit, though. They start to put forth some effort. They can love you just as fiercely as they sometimes hate you. They just have to learn how. They can be really, really wonderful kids.   The teacher is in charge of teaching. Duh. What exactly the classroom aide does varies a little bit from room to room, depending on the kids and how the teacher wants to use the aide. In the case of my class (elementary IEP, ages 9-13), the kids are on so many different levels, in so many different subjects that I do end up doing some lessons which is fine with me. I kind of like doing it. Otherwise, I'm just there for support however it's needed. If a kid needs help with an assignment, I help him. If a kid is upset about something, I talk to him. If a kid is done with an assignment and looking bored, I keep him occupied. If the teacher needs something done and she's busy, I do it. I'm also the staff that takes them to specials which is just what our program calls all the electives - gym, art, library, that kind of stuff. While I'm busy doing that, the teacher gets planning time. This is often the most difficult part of the day for a couple reasons. Number one, specials are usually a little more unstructured. Number two, we take a bus to another building down the street for most of our specials and transition is not easy for any of the kids in our program. All that moving around and overstimulation gets them wound up. This can be the most fun part of the day, too, but often the biggest problems crop up here. Because the classroom aides are with the kids all day, and because we get to do the fun activities with them, we have a different kind of relationship with the kids than the teachers do. We see and hear things that the teachers don't get to witness. Of course, that means we also get to handle a lot of the discipline too since the kids are never out of our sight. At a training session last year, the program director said that it's classroom aides that set the atmosphere and mood of the class, even more so than the teacher. At the time I thought she was just saying that because she was talking to a roomful of aides, but the longer I'm at this job, the more I think she's right. If you listen to the kids in the halls as they're having their freak-outs, you almost never hear them rant about their teacher. They're usually angry with their aide. And on the flip side, you almost never see a kid goof off around or joke with their teacher. Again, it's usually the aide.  Occasionally there is another staff in the classroom. There are a few 1:1 (one-to-one) aides. 1:1 aides get the pleasure of working exclusively with the most demanding kids in the program, the ones that are the most time-consuming and problematic. And for this they get extra low pay and no benefits! A lot of turn-over in this position. I started out as a 1:1 so I feel their pain. It's not an easy job. Not that ANY of it's easy.  The last primary difference between us and a regular school is the Help Center. The Help Center is three rooms at the end of the hall. One of the rooms has little cubicle desks in them, and two of the rooms are empty. While we do everything we can to keep the kids in class, sometimes they have to leave - if they get violent, disruptive, totally uncooperative, something along those lines. In that case, they go to the Help Center to calm down. There's staff that is specially trained to work there so sending a kid to the Help Center doesn't require sending the teacher or aide there with them. (And God bless the HC staff because they get the kids when they're at their worst). Usually the kids take a few minutes, get themselves together, and come back to class. If they do something worthy of suspension, they spend the whole day there. If a kid feels like they're about to lose it, they can ask for a voluntary break in the HC , basically some time away from the situtaion, but most of the kids don't have enough foresight for that. Identifying their emotions and things that trigger them is something we're constantly working on with all of them.  So that's what I do for a living. I feel like this might be a pretty muddled description, but if it is, it's because I'm still learning a lot about these kinds of programs and these kinds of kids.

      ... a field, a friend, and a book.  I can't remember who said that or where I copied it from, but it sums up how I feel about reading pretty well.  Heck, I can almost do without the other two as long as I have a good book.  Over at Live Journal, I'm part of a community called "The 50 Book Challenge."  All the members have made a committment to try and read 50 books in 2004.  It's not a competition so much as it is a deal with yourself to try and read more for pleasure.  I'm already an obsessive reader - I'm one of those people who totally tunes out the world for hours at a time when I'm in the middle of a good book - so I set my goal for the year at 125.  I also challenged myself to read more non-fiction.  So far I'm only at 46 for the year so I'm only on pace to read around 100, but I expect to make up a little ground on my summer breaks.  The best part about "The 50 Book Challenge" is that most people post what books they've read along with a short summary and/or review.  Some of the best books I've read this year have been recommendations from this community.  It's pretty nifty.  In addition to posting at "The 50 Book Challenge," most people cross-post their reviews to their personal journals so I'm going to start doing that too.  At the very least, I'll have something to update more regularly that way.  Besides, books are a huge part of my life.  They should probably be a huge part of my journal, too.

      So I downloaded this new browser called  urlLink Mozilla Firefox .  There was a thread at one of my  urlLink favorite websites  where people were raving about it.  I haven't even had it very long, and I gotta say, it's pretty awesome.    My favorite feature is what's called tab browsing.  Basically, you can have more than one website open in the same window at the same time and flip back and forth by clicking on the tabs at the top of the page.  When I first read about it, I thought, "Hmmm, that seems like a cool feature," but I didn't think about it being something that I would particularly use.  I've used this feature more times than I can count in the last day or so.  It's such a nice thing to have.  When I want to plan out my fantasy baseball roster, I can pull up the roster in one tab, pull up  urlLink ESPN.com  or  urlLink Sportsline.com  or another stats oriented site in another tab, and I just click back and forth between the two, and it's much easier and faster than having two different windows.  Also, I read a lot of book related sites and threads so I'll often pull my library account up in one tab, and pull "50 Book Challenge"  or the publishing thread at  urlLink Fametracker  up in another tab.  When I find a book or movie I think sounds interesting, I click over to my library account and immediately put it on request.  If you're reading an article that includes a link, you can right click on the link, open it up in another tab, and read it when you're ready.  Tabbed browsing has changed my life!  Another really cool feature is the search engines in the toolbar.  If you're familiar with the Google search bar, it's very much like that.  There's a little box up in the right hand corner of the screen.  Google is the default setting so you enter what you're searching for, and it'll automatically use the Google search engine to find what you're looking for.  But the cool thing is that you can add other extensions and engines.  So I can type a word in the box, hit the drop down menu, and click on Dictionary.com instead of Google, and it'll search Dictionary.com for a definition.  I've added extensions for Dictionary.com, Amazon, ebay, and  urlLink IMDB .  One more thing.  When you download it, it's very barebones.  There's a forward button, a back button, stop, reload, the address bar, and the Google box.  You can add pretty much anything else you want - adblockers (though it comes with a basic pop-up blocker that's very good), various toolbar buttons, games, etc. - but if you don't want it, it's not there.  So it runs MUCH faster than Internet Explorer and it's a lot less cluttered.  Granted, clutter may not bother you very much, but I hate all kinds of crap on my screen.  I have a pretty good internet connection, and Firefox is still noticeably faster than IE.  Other people claim it doesn't lock up as much as IE too, but I haven't been using it long enough to really compare the two browsers there.  So I beseech you one and all, try Firefox.  It's awesome!  And if my recommendation isn't enough,  urlLink Tom Ridge and Homeland Security say IE isn't safe.   So do it for your own good!  Sorry if this entry seems a little links happy.  I just learned how to do it.  Now playing: U2 (album: All That You Can't Leave Behind , track: When I Look at the World)  I'm on a U2 kick lately.  It happens. Now reading:  About halfway through  Wolves of the Calla , started  Sister's Keeper , and moving along again in  Essential X-Men, Vol. 2

      Dear Kobe,  I've been listening to you talk for weeks now about how you want a team that you can call "your team."  I'm not really a big fan of yours, but I'm gonna help you anyway, give you a little advice.  You cannot make a team yours by simply saying that it is.  You may be able to get ownership to make you the priority.  You may get them to hire a coach you like, bring in players you like, and get rid of players you don't like.  Still doesn't make it your team.  You may be the most talented player on the court, but that doesn't make it your team either.  It might surprise you to learn that the heart of the team is often not the guy with the most ability.  You can stand up in front of everyone on your team and tell them, "Listen up, guys.  This is my team."  You know what?  It still doesn't make it your team.  In fact, if you have to point it out to everyone, it's probably NOT your team.  The only way to make it your team is to earn it because those other four guys on the court with you?  They don't care if Jerry Buss likes you the best.  Oh, here's a hint.  Refusing to shoot for two quarters because you don't like teammates criticizing you doesn't earn you jack squat.  Either grow up and earn your own team or shut up.  Sincerely, Heather   P.S.  Don't go to Denver.  If you think 'Melo is going to put up with your "I'm the man," crap, you're in for a rude awakening.  Dear Shaq,  It's bad enough that you refer to yourself in the third person.  To refer to yourself in the third person AND use a nickname while doing it is inexcusable.  Please stop calling yourself  The Diesel.  Sincerely, Heather

      I mean, you're a girl!"    A few days ago someone pointed out to me that my list of books read in 2004 didn't include any graphic novels (and I'm talking about comics, not novels with sex and bad language just so we're clear).  Since this person (hi, Chris!) knows I read graphic novels, he was wondering what the deal was.  Believe it or not, I gave this issue a lot of thought (probably a lot more than was necessary).  On one hand, I completely believe that comics are a valid form of literature and that really good ones can get across things that a regular book might not be able to.  But on the other hand, a lot of the graphic novels I've read this year are really just collections of ongoing titles and I blow through them so quickly that it almost seemed like cheating to include them on my book list.  But I have been keeping a separate list of graphic novels I've read this year, and so here it is, Chris.   Graphic Novels So Far in 2004    The Ultimates, Vol. 1  by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch  Ultimate Spider-Man, Vols. 3-7  by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley  Ultimate X-Men, Vols. 1-3  by Mark Millar, Brian Michael Bendis, David Finch et. al - I think Millar wrote all the volumes I read, but Bendis took over at some point, and  Amazon's about as clear as mud sometimes when it comes to comic book credits.  Bone, Vols. 1-9  written AND drawn by Jeff Smith and one of my very favorite comics ever  Batman: The Long Halloween  by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale  Fable: Legends in Exile  by Bill Willingham, Lan Medina (pencils), Steve Leiahola and Craig Hamilton (inkers - we're not tracers!)  I have this sitting in front of me so I can cite all the artists involved.  I just finished  Fables  a couple hours ago, and I really, really liked it.  The premise is that all the Fable lands were overthrown by The Adversary and all the characters were exiled.  They now live undercover in the human or Mundane world among the mundys which is what they call all the non-Fable people.  All the old favorites are here, and the take on some of them is pretty funny.  Snow White is bitter, brassy, and second-in-command in Fabletown.  Prince Charming is a sleazy ladies man.  Jack of Beanstalk fame is a lazy bum, always looking for a good get rich quick scheme.  The Big Bad Wolf goes by Bigby (and mostly appears in human form so far) and is the sheriff of the Fable community.  Even the cameos are hilarious.  My favorite is the chain-smoking Little Pig who keeps running away from the farm to crash on Bigby's couch because he figures the wolf still owes him for that house he blew down.  Anyway, the book is very funny and very creative.  I've already put volumes 2 and 3 on request at the library, and I wouldn't mind owning them eventually unless the next two are terrible.  Oh, despite the storybook characters, it's definitely an adult book.  Snow White swears like a sailor.  Next up for grapic novels: Alan Moore's  From Hell  is waiting for me at the library right now and his  V for Vendetta  is on request.  I think I might re-read  Batman: Year One  as well.  I know I read it years ago, but I can't remember a single thing that happened, and I have more of an investment in the Bat-mythos now.  And I'm still making slow but steady progress through  Essential X-Men, Vol. 2   And now I'll leave you with this tidbit: "The average comic book introduces children to nearly twice as many words as the average children's book and more than five times as many as the average child-adult conversation." From a 1993 study published in  The Journal of Child Language .  Interesting, no?  Now playing: Jars of Clay (album:  Who We Are Instead , track: Show You Love)

      I finally finished  Wolves of the Calla, The Dark Tower Vol. 5  by Stephen King a couple days ago.  It took me a while to get going in it for some reason, but once I was moving I had a hard time stopping.  I sat in the bathtub for 45 minutes one night as the water got colder and colder because I was so close to the end, and I couldn't stop long enough to wash my hair.  My favorite parts of the series involve the characters travelling back and forth between the gunslinger's world and our world, and there was a lot of that going on here.  Possibly  my favorite of the series so far.  It's  toss-up between this one and  The Drawing of the Three (Vol. 2) .  There are occasionally things and ideas that don't quite work, but overall The Dark Tower series is such a creative amalgamation of different genres that it's tough for me to not like it.  This one definitely owed something to  The Magnificent Seven  which King is kind enough to admit unlike J.K. "I Swear I've Never Read Tolkien In My Life And He's Had No Influence On Me Whatsoever" Rowling.  (Don't get me wrong, I love the Harry Potter books, but I have a hard time believing this because sometimes her ideas are SO close to Tolkein's stuff.  It's become kind of an inside joke between Mark and I.)  So 47 books down, 78 to go if I want to meet my original goal of 125 for the year.  It doesn't look good, I gotta say.  I was hoping to read a lot more while I was off, but in those two weeks I only read two books.  Next up:  My Sister's Keeper  by Jodi Picoult and  Quirky QWERTY: A Biography of the Typewriter and Its Many Characters  by Torbjorn Lundmark.  I've already started  Apostles of Rock: The Splintered World of Contemporary Christian Rock  by Jay R. Howard and John M. Streck, but it's heavier reading so I'm trying to read some lighter stuff at the same time.  Now playing:  Everywhere I Look  by Phil Keaggy

      I just read that Paula Danziger, author of  The Cat Ate My Gymsuit  and many other great young adult books, died of complications from a heart attack.  I can't even begin to explain how much this news has bummed me out.  When I was in seventh grade, I won a chance to go see her speak at our local library, and I still remember her as one of the best speakers I've ever heard.  She was bright and funny, just like her books.  After the lecture I got to meet her, and when I told her I wanted to be a writer when I grew up she responded like that was the greatest news she'd ever heard and offered me all kinds of advice and encouragment.  Even though kids must've told her that all the time, she acted like it was the first time.  I still have a beat-up copy of  The Cat Ate My Gymsuit  that's inscribed with, "Dear Heather, Keep writing!  You can do it!  Paula Danziger."  I feel like a little piece of my childhood just died.

      We're now through about one and a half weeks of summer school, and man, what a disaster it's been. We only have four kids, three who've actually been in school, and half of them are in full-on crisis mode. Plus, depending on the positioning of the moon and the stars over Venus, they may or may not all hate each other. Here's a summary of my week:    Daniel, 12, hasn't made it to school yet. He was admitted to the psychiatric wing of the local hospital for physical agression over summer break and has been there for about three weeks. Last I heard, he'll be discharged tomorrow and back at school on Thursday. Before break he was on at-home suspension for shoving the principal into a wall (twice) hard enough that she thought her nose was broken. He'd also developed a habit of going AWOL when he got upset or in trouble. On the worst day, he ran out of the building and half a mile down the road before he stopped. I know that's how far it was because I'm the poor fool who had to go after him, and I clocked it later out of curiousity. Ideally, he should come out of the hospital in a better frame of mind, but somehow I don't think that's necessarily going to be the case.     Devin, 13, is just a walking disaster. He spent half the day in the help center today (a group of rooms where the kids go when they're so disruptive that they can't be in class). He punched three ceiling tiles out and ripped them apart. He tore up the jersey he had been wearing in gym class. And best yet, he pulled a cigarette lighter out of his pocket, flicked it on, knelt down next to a spot where the carpet was pulling up, and threatened to "burn this fucker to the ground!" That's about where he got put into a physical restraint. I could spend a whole entry on Devin, and probably will at some point, but for now I'll just say that he's in a crisis state. Everything he seemed to be learning about dealing with his emotions has flown out the window. He's screaming, yelling, swearing, throwing chairs, trying to leave the building, among other things. His counselour has a meeting with his mom tomorrow.    Thomas, 11, is fine as long as no one looks at him, touches him, or talks to him. On the bus ride home yesterday a couple of older kids started making fun of him and he flipped out. He started throwing around racial slurs, he shoved a couple kids, he told everyone he was bringing a knife or a gun on the bus the next day and taking care of them, he hit the bus aide when she tried to intervene. The bus company's security company met the bus and escorted Thomas home. And go figure, the bus company is now refusing to transport him! His counselour has a meeting with his mom tomorrow, too.    Thank God for Dominik, 11. He has his problems, but they usually pass quickly. Last Tuesday he was sure we were all racist ("You're only taking points from the black boys and none from the white boy!"), but by Wednesday he'd forgotten. Of course, I also gave him a pretty good lecture about throwing around accuasations like that. Usually he doesn't handle name-calling or teasing very well which is a problem with Devin the way he is lately, but Dom has done pretty well so far this summer. He finds out this week that he's going to a new program in September though so we'll see how that goes over. I can't decide if he'll be excited or furious.    The good news is, Dominik will be the only kid we have tomorrow. Daniel will be in the hospital most of the day, and Devin and Thomas are at home until their parents come in to work out some kind of plan to deal with what's going on with them. The bad news is, they'll ALL be back on Thursday.     The next five weeks can NOT go fast enough.    Now playing:  American Fast Food , Randy Stonehill  Now reading:  Kick Me: Adventures in Adolescence  by Paul Feig (creator of the totally awesome  Freaks and Geeks ) and  Apostles of Rock: The Splintered World of Contemporary Christian Music  by Jay R.

      #48  My Sister's Keeper  by Jodi Picoult  Anna is a designer baby, bred specifically to be a genetic match for her older sister who has leukemia. Throughout the years, Anna gives blood, bone marrow, and anything else her sister needs. When her parents ask her to donate a kidney, however, she refuses and sues them for medical emancipation and the right to make her own decisions about her body, upsetting the way things have always been. I really liked the book a lot, and I liked the way it was told from different characters' points of view. Characters (like Anna's mom) who would've been one-dimensional otherwise, were a little more sympathetic. Picoult does a good job of making a case for everyone's opinion about what should happen. I think the end was a major cop-out but not so much that it ruined how much I loved the rest of the book. Recommended.    #49 and #50  Remember Me to Harold Square  and  Thames Doesn't Rhyme With James  by Paula Danziger  I was so bummed about her death that I decided to pull out a couple of her books and re-read them.   Remember Me to Harold Square  was always my favorite, and I was glad to find that it's every bit as sweet and funny and true as I remember.   Thames  was its sequel, and while it wasn't as good as the first, it was still a fun read. I'm sorry my own kids won't be reading new material from Paula some day.    I also finished  Fables Vol. 2: Animal Farm.  It was great. All the non-human Fables decide to begin a revolution with the goal of taking back their homelands, even if it means killing any dissenting Fables who get in their way. The story was even more developed than the first volume and the characters were used wonderfully including some we haven't met before. I actually gasped in surprise twice while reading this, and it's been a while since a comic book made me do that. Everyone in the world should be reading this book.  Everyone.  Yeah, that means you!    So I've now met the community goal of 50 books, but I still have 75 to go if I want to meet my personal goal of 125.

      #50  Dave Barry's Book of Bad Songs  by Dave Barry Dave Barry, columnist for The Miami Herald, writes a book about the bad songs that people love to hate and hate to love. It had some pretty funny moments in it - I especially enjoyed the section on misheard lyrics - but I have to admit that it wasn't as hysterically funny as some of the recommendations I read led me to believe it would be. Still, funny enough that I put another highly recommended Barry book on request at the library.  #51  The Pact: A Love Story  by Jodi Picoult Chris and Emily have known each other all their lives. Their parents have been the best of friends since before the kids were born. When the kids grow up and begin dating, everyone sees it as the way it's supposed to be. Which is why they're so shocked when Emily and Chris are taken to the hospital one night, Emily dead from a gunshot wound, Chris bleeding from the head. Chris claims that he and Emily had a suicide pact and that she killed herself but he passed out before he could do the same. The state - and more importantly, Emily's mother - believes Chris killed Emily. The book follows the trial and the affect it has on the families and the relationship between the families. There are some things that seem a little implausible, but I really liked the book a lot. Much of it is flashback, and it's very well done. The reader gets Chris's story, then Emily's story, then the trial and the reveal about what really happened. Even at the very end, I had no idea if the jury was going to rule for Chris or against him, and usually I can make a pretty good guess.  In the world of graphic novels, I just finished up Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's  From Hell.   This book was amazing. It took me a couple chapters to get into it - it's much wordier and slower developing than most graphic novels I've read - but once I got going, I couldn't stop. I have to admit, I had no idea how much of this was really based on history and fact. There's 42 pages of very detailed annotations at the end, and it made for some fascinating reading. This was deeper and more developed than a lot of novels I've read this year. For anyone considering reading it, it is pretty graphic.  I gave up on  Apostles of Rock: The Splintered World of Contemporary Christian Music.   I liked the idea behind the book, but it just wasn't very interesting. The authors admitted in the foreword that they didn't get a lot of cooperation from people within the industry, and the book definitely suffers because of it. There's a lot of theories and questions thrown around, some very interesting (How do you define Christian music? By the music itself - the lyrics - or by the beliefs of the singer? Does "secular" music by musicians who claim to be Christians - like U2 - count as Christian music? Has Christian music become a ghetto, preaching only to those who are already saved and not interacting much with those who aren't? And if so, is that a bad thing? Should singers "water down" the message of their music if it means the chance to interact more with the unsaved world?), but without commentary from those working in the world of Christian music it's mostly just questions. There's no real discussion. I think there's a lot here that would make a really good, interesting read. This book just isn't it.  I didn't finish Mike Fieg's  Kick Me: Adventures in Adolescence  because I had to take it back to the library.  I've already put it back on request so I can finish it off, though.

      It's official.  I hate my class.  Considering that they're generally acknowledged to be the most difficult kids in the school and that I've now had all of them for two years, I think I've done pretty well. Many other aides have come to hate their classes in a much shorter time period. But now I hate mine. I want them to all go away. I want new kids and stat.  Today Devin drove me to my breaking point. In the past two years, we've developed a pretty decent relationship. He came into the program with no long-term relationships of any kind so it was difficult and slow developing but the relationship was definitely there. It's all gone to pot the last three weeks. He's gone through a lot of loss the past few months, and I know that's on his mind. Two of his favorite staff members have gotten fired recently, almost one right after the other. (The firings were both totally bogus, but that's a story for another time.) Both of these staff members worked in the Help Center so they were there for Devin when he was at his worst and he spent a lot of time with them. They were also both African-American males and although, Devin probably doesn't think of it this way, they were pretty much it in the way of black, male influence in his life. So... all that to say, I know he's not in a good spot emotionally. But he is driving me completely batty. Every time I give him a direction - it could be anything from, "Let's do your math" to "Please keep your hands to yourself" - he immediately starts yelling and swearing at me. Today I was everything from a stupid bitch to a white motherfucker. I'm not accusing him of anything, I'm not yelling at him. Every little thing I say gets a nasty, hateful response. Usually I'm pretty good at ignoring him or getting him out of the room without blowing up at him, but today I lost it. Devin went out in the hall to ask Monica, the teacher, (she was working with another student out there) if he could get on the computer. She said no. He came back in the classroom, walked over to the computer, sat down and started playing a game. I said, "Devin, you need to get off the computer." He said, "Monica, told me I could get on it." I said, "No, she didn't." He started the swearing and name-calling, but since he was relatively quiet about it, I ignored it, told him he was going to lose points until he decided to follow directions (we have a point based behavior system that we use throughout the day), and went back to what I was doing. But he sat there at the computer, mumbling names and threats under his breath, and suddenly I just could not take it anymore. He was blatantly disregarding directions. Two other kids sat in the classroom, doing exactly what they were asked to do, watching Devin do whatever the heck he wanted to do. So I got up and walked over to the computer and took the headphones off his head and told him that he needed to get off the computer or he'd have to leave the room. He snatched them back. I'll point out here, that you really want to avoid any kind of power struggle with the kids at school but with Devin in particular. If he feels challenged, he will not back down. I snatched the headphones back and he grabbed them again. At this point, I felt seething anger. If I were a cartoon character, you would've seen the red creep up my face and seen smoke pouring out of my ears. I reached down, ripped the power cord out of the back of the computer, ripped the other end of the cord out of the power strip, wrapped up the cord, and shoved it in my desk. Devin stood up, started yelling bloody murder, walked out of the room and tossed the headphones down the hall for good measure. Fortunatley, there was staff there to grab him and get him into the Help Center. Before a kid in the Help Center can return to class he has to resolve with the staff or peer he was having a problem with (resolving involves discussing what happened, why it was wrong, what could've been done differently etc.). Devin flatly refused. He said he wasn't talking to me ever again and he'd sit in the Help Center for the rest of the year if he had to. Maybe I'll get lucky and he'll stick to his promise.  The bad thing is, I don't even care. Usually I would feel bad that I reacted poorly (which I did big time) and I would atleast duck my head in to the Help Center to see if Devin wanted to talk (the kids often don't really mean what they say). But not today. Today I sat in the classroom and was more than happy to let him sit and rot where he was. I've had the exact same resolvement with him atleast once a week during the summer session, and I don't even know what else to say to him.  It doesn't help that I know we'll be getting a new class in September. All the kids we have now will either be moving to another class or going to different programs. You'd think that knowledge would make these last few weeks easier, but I think it's making it worse. That light at the end of the tunnel is like a teasing, taunting thing.  In other news, the Pudding Pop is back! It was sad how excited I was when I saw them sitting in the freezer at the grocery store. I loved those things when I was a kid, and I never understood why Jello stopped making them. They're still pretty darn good, too. So the day wasn't a total loss.

      Dear Greg,  Thanks.  Thanks for being the kind of player who I could love even when I really, really hated the team you played most of your career with.  The Braves handed my team, the Pirates, the most crushing postseason loss of my fanhood, and at the end of the day, I still really liked you.  Thanks for wanting to win and being super competitive without throwing bats at people and storming around the field like a madman.  You've always done your talking with your arm and glove and not with your mouth.  Man, that is rare today.  Thanks for embracing role the of The Professor, something most most athletes would hate.  Thanks for wearing your glasses when you're not pitching.  Hey, it's a small thing, but this bespectacled girl thought it was cool (and still does).  Thanks for being friends with the pitching staff that you pitched 10+ years with.  I don't expect every athlete to be bestest friends with their teammates, but it is awfully nice when it does happen.  Can I come golfing with you, Tom, and John some time?  Thanks for not really caring that people tend to overappreciate Roger Clemens and underappreciate you.  Roger's heat is more attention grabbing than your pinpoit control and pitch variation, but I don't think you care.  Most people say they would take Roger as a starter over you, but I don't think you care about that either.  When Roger got win number 300 we had weeks of countdowns, constant media coverage, and story after story in magazine after magazine.  When you got close to 300 we didn't get much at all.  When you GOT 300 you STILL didn't get much at all.  But I don't think you care because in the end, your team got the win that day.  Thanks for being so great for so long.  Sure, some of that is beyond your control - you've only been on the DL ONCE in your career!  But here's a couple fun facts that you might not even know.  Not one player who played in your first win (Sept. 7, 1986) is still playing.  None of the other 12 winning pitchers that day is still pitching.  You've had sixteen (!) 15 win seasons.  For nine straight seasons you had a walk ratio lower than 2 per nine innings.  Amazing.  Thanks for not coming out to tip your hat after your 300th win because it wasn't your home ballpark and you didn't think it was respectful to the other team's fans.  I don't know that they really would've had a problem with it, Greg, but most athletes wouldn't have been able to see that moment as anything but theirs so you definitely get points for thinking beyond yourself.  And most of all - probably above all else - thanks for just being a good guy.  I've never had to read a story about your sexual escapades, your adventures with drugs and alcohol, your anger management problems, or your cancerous attitude in the clubhouse.  Your coaches seem to like you, and your teammates seem to like you even more.  You've always gone out to the mound, thrown the ball, and then gone home.  And I love you for it.  Thanks, Heather
