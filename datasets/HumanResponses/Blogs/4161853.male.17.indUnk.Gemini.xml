        abbe made a funny today, she say "thank god i'm female... oh HAHA TGIF!!" so yes its monday afternoon, arond 4:30. yesterday was cool, seriously tho it wasnt very hot out. i kinda forgot wut i did yesterday, oh yea, me and abbe did sum yardwork, walked the dog, went to cumbys and spent 10 of my 20 bux on completely fattening junk food, and then we watched 40 days and 40 nights. kinda a love story tho, but it had lots and lots and lots of boobies so that made it acceptable. hmm... yea so that was my sunday. today i woke up around 2, watched tv for 2 hours with abbe, and then here i am. i am very happy, cuz cold got signed to a different record label (they didnt like their old one) and they replaced their two guitarists after the back up went to evanescence (eh.. wutever floats ur boat) and their main guitarist kelly left to persue other stuff in life. so they took their old guitarist from their old band Grundig (basicly cold with a diff name) and they took a back up guitarist from a broken up band called darwin's waiting room. so now they have created 8 new songs, and are going to be going back on tour vurry soon. that makes me vurrry happy. because cold kicks ass. alright, if your still reading this, im gunna go now. byebye.   mood:  wierd  currently digesting:  cinamon & brownsugar poptarts and salt &amp; vinegar pringles  listening to:  abbe talking about her toenails

         sup my sweet lil bitches?       alright so i woke up not under blankets, but under an abbe. it was fun as fuck to wake up to ur girlfriend sitting on top of u staring at you. so after abbe got off of me, my mom yelled at me to get up and get dressed and get in the car or face certain death. so i complained that i was hungry and she said alright ill take u to dunkin donuts.. so i was in the car faster than u can say penis. we got to dunkin donuts and i got a cinnamon raisin bagle (no cream cheese) and a chocolate frosted donut (..also no cream cheese...) then we got to my mom's place of work, and the power was out, so we decided to go clothes shopping. so i got a load of new shirts and abbe got a load of sexy clothing that is eventually just gunna come off her neways. we get home, walk dog, eat fries at philameenies, took a nap, then started getting physical but abbes mom came and kidnapped her from me. but she'll be back tomorrow.      k thats enuff horseshit for now, im gunna go.      mood:  tired, kinda bored    currently digesting:  bagel, donut, fries, smartfood popcorn, 2 peanut butter and jelly's    listening to:  "witch" by Cold
