       All of you are familiar with how pale I am. For the last couple of weeks, I have been making an effort to get a little tan on my body so that I wouldn't burn when I get to Thailand. Well, too bad. Yesterday Somrat and I took the ferry from Fisherman's Wharf to Tiburon to have lunch and walk around. We had a great time and it was a gorgeous day (hot and sunny) but I am so burnt! I need to get used to putting on my sunscreen everyday. At least I learned my lesson in a city where I can run to Walgreens and pick up some aloe vera :)

        So, I finally got my official letter of acceptance from Cambridge on Wednesday. (They have 3 levels of admissions committees! How bureaucratic is that?!)&nbsp;Of course, they sent it to Austin the day after I left. The good news is that I will be able to get my passport mailed to me in San Francisco WITH my British student visa before I leave. This is very good because I don't have time to get the visa when I'm back in September.   I'm headed to San Francisco this evening (my flight is direct, it is so nice not to fly from Austin). I'm visiting my boyfriend Somrat and getting to know the city the way I probably never will locked in the Stanford law library for 3 years. It should be great!

       Who would have guessed that Great Britain would be slower at issuing visas than, say, Zambia? Luckily, I don't need it quite yet. June 22 is the day of international departure. First stop is San Francisco.

       Somehow I am trying to pack an entire summer's worth of supplies into one not-so-large backpack. At first, I didn't think this would be much of a challenge. After all, I bought some of that cool travel stuff like nylon shorts that I can wash and dry overnight and a tiny travel towel that is like a chamoise that you use to dry your car. But then I looked at the recommended first aid kit that you should take to crazy places I'm going like Africa and South East Asia. I literally could probably pack 20 pounds of bandaids, drugs, and ointments just in case something happens. My aunt Beth (the doctor) even thinks I should take codeine... you know, just in case I break an arm or a leg. By that logic, I figure I should take one of those portable defibrilators... you know, just in case I have a heart attack. So right now I'm trying to strike that balance between the things I'll definitely need (socks) and the things I hopefully won't need (ace bandages). Then, maybe I'll have time to mourn for the things that I can't bring (blow dryer).

       Greetings from Myanmar! Judy and I arrived in Yangon 2 days ago and are having a great time thus far. Yesterday we went to the Shwegadon Paya which is the largest Buddhist temple in Yangon. We were lucky enough to meet a monk who showed us around for over 2 hours. He was learning english by listening to the Voice of America and watching CNN at his monastery :) It was great to learn about the history of all the sites from a local. We went to lunch with him afterwards too and might go see his monastery in Yangon when we go back there on July 1 to catch our flight back to Bangkok. Last night we took an overnight bus to Mandalay. Judy and I were the only Westerners on the air conditioned bus. It is really amazing but there really are NO tourists here. We have seen probably less than 10 since we arrived and obviously we are going to the places where you would expect tourists to visit. Today we took a bit of a break and napped in our hotel. We went to Mandalay hill this afternoon and climbed the steps to the top. It was an amazing view of the countryside. Tomorrow we will be taking a boat to Bagan (the site of one of the most impressive temple complexes in the region). Evidently the best way to get around is by horse cart there. I'll let you know how that goes!

       So I'm at the internet cafe and I'll try take 2 with the post! Yesterday we visited the Grand Palace and saw the Emerald Buddha. The stupas were so ornate and detailed. It really was amazing. Judy and I also took a water taxi a few times (what a great way to travel... get a cool breeze in the hot city) to get our Myanmar visa and tickets. We head to Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar (Burma) tonight. We will be there until July 1. Unfortunatley, I won't post again until then because there is NO internet access in Burma. Isn't that crazy? But, so far we are having a great time, eating lots of yummy Thai food, seeing a lot, and sweating like crazy :)

       It was another fantastic weekend here in San Francisco. Each summer, many of the "neighborhoods" in San Francisco have street festivals. This weekend was the Italian district called North Beach's festival. There was food, music, arts and crafts vendors, and tons of people. I wish I would be here for some of the others because it was really fun. Unfortunately, later on Sunday Somrat and I went through the SF version of the Austin Chronicle/Dallas Observer - entertainment magazine - and realized we missed a free concert in Golden Gate Park with Gavin DeGraw and Five for Fighting. Boo!

       Yesterday I went to San Francisco's Asian Art Museum all afternoon. It was a phenomenal museum with works from Japan, Korea, China, South East Asia, and South Asia. I probably spent about 3 hours there and easily could have spent double. I learned a lot about Hinduism and Buddhism and got a preview of some of the temples that I'll see in Bagan, Myanmar (Burma) and Angkor Wat, Cambodia. This museum is about 100 times better than the SF Museum of Modern Art. Judy and I went here in April and I was extremely disappointed, particularly because the painting wing was closed and we only saw scandinavian furniture and photography.  Also, I went to dinner with Eric Sublett yesterday and he is headed to Harvard law school. Everyone goes east so here is my plea to all of you rising seniors applying to law school... join me at Stanford!

       It was another fun weekend in San Francisco. On Saturday, Somrat and I went apartment hunting with our friend Gautam, a fellow plan 2 graduate who is moving out here, and then we went to the beach at outer sunset. It was freezing and we dipped our toes in the water for about 2 seconds before running back to Gautam's car. Yesterday we walked all day long. We went out to Golden Gate park for a few hours. Then we walked to the marina for lunch and over to the wharf. On our way back home, we stopped in at the cable car museum which was really fascinating. It is actually the power station for all three cable car lines and it had a bunch of old cable cars and information about how it all works. Evidently in 1947 the city almost put the cable cars out of commission with the advent of city buses. But, the city rallied around the cable cars and they decided to keep them. I am now well-versed in cable car trivia. Did you know the cables have to be replaced once every 70-200 days? Now you do.

       So yesterday Somrat saved the day (yet again) with a client at Salesforce.com and one of the directors says, "thanks, man. you know what, why don't you take your girlfriend out to as nice a restaurant as you can find and expense it." So, we went all out. We went to La Folie in Russian Hill and had an amazing three course dinner. It was all great, but the desserts were phenomenal. I had a valrhona chocolate cake with grand marnier ice cream. Yum! It was definitely the highlight of my week thus far which has mostly consisted of making travel plans and wandering around sunny San Francisco.

       So, I just heard that I was in last week's Newsweek (June 1?). No, it really isn't that exciting. In fact, some might find it somewhat embarassing. Myself, Kevin Curry, Cedric Mims, and Ricky Vu did a photoshoot in early May for an article on taking longer than 4 years to graduate. I read the article online yesterday but I haven't seen the picture. They didn't even quote any of the 4 of us. I thought it was strange to put a picture of people you didn't even mention in the article. If you take Newsweek, let me know what you think. I might go to the library later to check it out.

       I got my passport back from the Brits! One more hitch though... my visa starts October 1 and my flight arrives in London on September 30 for when I go to Cambridge. I'm not going to worry about that right now.  Speaking of Cambridge, on Friday I met this woman who went there and she was telling me about how I should get a bike while I'm there. Then she told me this crazy story of when Stephen Hawking almost ran her over when she was biking home with her groceries. Now that is crazy! I actually saw Stephen Hawking speak at SMU while I was in high school.

       So, I haven't posted in a few days mostly because I didn't do much during the week. I mostly bummed around, reading a new book (Reading Lolita in Tehran by Azar Nafisi... I highly recommend it). I also got a chance to see my friend Joey Neugart and his girlfriend Lucy. This weekend has been GREAT so far. On Friday, Somrat, myself, Joey, Lucy, and a bunch of Somrat's Salesforce friends went to see Jamie Cullum perform. He is a young British jazz/pop musician and was an unbelievable performer. You can check out his website at www.jamiecullum.com and see him on David Letterman on June 10. If you get a chance to see this guy in concert you are really in for a treat because he is hilariously funny, has a lot of energy, and plays some great music.  Yesterday we went out to Napa and went to a few wineries. It wasn't even that crowded which was surprising for a Saturday afternoon. Then we came back and visited Somrat's friend Rishik in Berkeley. We went up to the top of the Berkeley hills and took in the great views of the entire Bay Area. I wished I had brought my camera. But, so far I keep forgetting to bring it with me! So now I have at least 2 San Francisco lessons for my trip: wear sunscreen and take my camera!

       Today we went to see the first pyramids. We went to Saqqara to see the step pyramid, the first one built in 2650bc. It had six levels. Then we went to Dashur and saw the bent pyramid... they didn't quite get the angles right and changed half way through the pyramid, leaving it bent. Then we saw the first 'true pyramid,' the red pyramid. They were great and a lot less touristy than Giza. We also went to the museum in Memphis but it wasn't really much to see. Tonight we head to Aswan on the train.

       Today we visited islamic cairo... the old medieval area of the city that is filled with 9th-13th century mosqes and markets in dark alleys. We started the day by visiting El-Ahzar mosque, one of the few that tourists can enter. Our guide profusely praised tourists for donating money that restored the mosque after a 1992 earthquake. He was seriously impressed that I knew there were 5 minarets for the 5 pillars but was later blown away when Jerry started chatting him up in Arabic. The markets here are just crazy... we saw everything from gold and jewels to chickens having their heads lopped off (fresh food). Later in the day we visited the Citadel... built by Saladin and the home to the Egyptian government for over 700 years. It is a huge fortress built on a hill that would overlook the nile if it wasn't for the urban sprawl that also houses a number of stunning mosques. Jerry and I felt silly for not knowing about such a treasure until we came across it in the guidebook; it easily compared to european landmarks like westminster abbey and yet we didn't even know it existed. It is fascinating to see what the Egyptians have been capable of building since 3500 bc through 1300 ad... but then you think that all they do today is cash in from the past successes through the tourism industry, not the pioneers of architecture, arts, language, science that they once were.

       Cairo is crazy. People are out in the streets here until the wee hours and stores seem to be open from about 9am to 3am. Last night, Jerry and I went out with my friend Ahmed and his girlfriend Sarah (all the Arab people have a double-take moment when I tell them my name... "that is an Arab name! really?"). We had dinner at a restaurant on the nile... a few doors down from TGI Fridays. It was really nice and we had a great time talking with them about Egypt. Tonight, Jerry and I went on a nile dinner cruise and saw belly dancers and sufi dancers. We pretty much knew what the belly dancers would do- shimmy around in tight, revealing outfits- but the sufi dancing was awesome. This guy literally twirled around for like 20 minutes straight and was doing all these funky things with castanet-like things and huge colorful skirts he was wearing. It was really cool. After our cruise we got ice cream at the patisserie across the street from our hotel... which is of course open until 3am or something. They have the best mango ice cream (and cantelope, strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate... we have tried it all! it is so hot!) here.

           Today we got up bright and early to visit the pyramids... the last surviving wonder of the world. The day was off to a great start as we walked toward the Egyptian Museum to catch a bus out to Giza. A very nice man named Sayad came up to Jerry and I and asked us if we were headed to the Pyramids... he was headed home to Giza and offered to take us there. t was great because we never would have figured out this bus. It was all locals... the bus number was not even in Roman characters... Arabic ones. He paid for our bus ride, a minibus ride to Giza, and then took us out for tea and sheesha (tobacco water pipe... called a hooka in the usa) before getting us right to the front gate. He said we reminded us of his daughter and son, showed us his grandkids pictures... it was great. We talked American politics with him... just like we do with the locals everywhere we visit. They can't wait to get right into the thick of it... 9/11, Israel, George Bush, John Kerry, how they love America and hate the government, their ideas on peace and one world.&nbsp;Afterwords, Jerry and I hiked up the hill and headed straight for the largest pyramid, Khufu, and bought our tickets to go inside. We hiked up into the inner chambers and it was quite a squeeze through the narrow passageway. It was really incredible because you look at the pyramids and you're like... wow... I can't believe they built this huge structure. But then you get inside and you really realize how complex of an architectural monument it is. In fact, they buried the engineers in tombs right outside of the pyramid that they built... that is probably the best props any engineer ever got. We explored the minor pyramids, a bunch of tombs, as well as the other 2 huge pyramids. Then, we went on a horseback ride out to get the 'panorama' view of the pyramids, out to the desert, and back to the sphinx. It was awesome. We spent about 4 hours exploring the area and we were dead tired and so hot by the end. We went to the closest air-conditioned restaurant we could find when we got out of the area... turned out to be a Pizza Hut :) So we had pizza on the third floor of pizza hut with a Giza pyramids and sphinx view. Sigh... definitely the juxtaposition of ancient and modern. We are headed back to the pyramids tonight for the 'sound and light' show. It is supposed to be pretty cheesy with the sphinx narrating the show... but we'll get to see the pyramids at sunset and at night which will be awesome.

       So, late last night we made it to Egypt and our first touristy stop was the Egyptian Museum. It was a really interesting experience. First, it was just chalk full of the most amazing artifacts. But, it literally felt like a warehouse where nothing was labeled and everything was left in a haphazard place. It was organized roughly by date, but after that you were on your own. It really makes you take for granted the modern museums you see in America and Europe because this museum had no maps, no multimedia displays, just an occasional typewritten description of an artifact that didn't really help you place it in 3500 years of ancient Egyptian history. Nonetheless, it was breathtaking... we went to the mummy room and saw 10 preserved mummies... we saw all of the treasures from Tuthenkamen's tomb. Evidently the only reason he is famous is that his tomb had never been looted when it was discovered so it was a good specimen... he wasn't much of a pharoah... Jerry and I both remember thinking he was equal to Ramses II or something like that. But, we are really excited about Egypt. We are headed to the pyramids tomorrow, Islamic and Coptic Cairo the next day, and to some temples that are even older than those at Giza the next. All the while we are stuffing our faces with felafel and shwarma at every turn. Yum!!! Oh, and we get student discounts on everything... even our train rides. We love it here! It isn't even that hot today (knock on wood).

       Jerry and I figure that all of our travels from here on out take us one step closer to home. And so we flew from Johannesburg to Cairo yesterday via Nairobi and Khartoum... at least 1000 miles closer... which means less painful flights to get back. Here are some thoughts on yesterday. First, we were watching BBC world on the airplane and seeing all the reports of the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan thinking, wow, our plane is going to be touching down in that country in a few hours. We didn't get off but it was still strange. Second, the Nairobi airport is the most disorganized place I have ever seen. They took our boarding pass at the gate and we wandered across the tarmac and could have boarded any plane we so chose... they never checked our boarding pass again and the only way we even found our plane was that there was a small sign by the stairway up to it. Crazy! That would never go over in America... no security there. Pick a plane any plane. But, we made it safely, even early to Egypt and got to our hotel easily. This morning we made all our travel plans including overnight trains to Aswan and an overnight train back to Cairo and a bus ticket to Israel. So we are all set. And, it is SOOOO cheap here. We spent less on all our transportation than for our first bus ticket in Africa. Wow! Okay, more to come...

       Yesterday I bought a new book called 'Dark Star Safari: an Overland Journey from Cairo to Capetown' by Paul Theroux. It is such a good book and I've barely even started it. The best part is that it articulates a lot of the observations that Jerry and I have had about Africa. Highly recommended :)

       I am getting a good preview to living in England for a year on this trip. Yesterday we were hanging out with another American, Pete from New Jersey, and we were talking about the weather in celcius. We realized... wow we speak metric now. We measure distances in kilometers and we buy drinks in mililiters. And we are totally used to it. It is funny how easy it is to adjust when you do it everyday. People are so shocked to find out we are still on the imperial system... it is like the one way America is still in the stone age.

       Jerry and I have made the long 700 mile journey from Victoria Falls back to Pretoria. On Saturday night we took an overnight train from Vic Falls to Bulawayo. We had our own first class sleeper for only $10 each... lots cheaper than Europe! Then we hung out in Bulawayo... a really beautiful city for the day and took the overnight bus here to Pretoria. We are definitely ready to sleep in a real bed tonight before our flight to Cairo on Tuesday. Egypt here we come!

       2 days after our rafting adventure, Jerry and I went on a safari! We thought we would go to Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe but after some price comparisons and a realistic look at how much time we had left in Africa, we opted for a 1 day trip to Chobe National Park in Botswana. (At Victoria Falls it is called the '4 corners' because Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe all bnorder each other) We were in a group with 2 South Africans, a Swede, and a Brit. They drove us to the border and then we switched into a 4x4. We had a short drive over to the dock and the first part of our trip was a safari cruise. And it was amazing! The first thing we did was drive literally 4 feet away from this HUGE crocodile. They only attack when you are in the water so the guide says it is safe to get this close. Everyone in the boat was scared to death though. We kept out distance with the hippos- which are the most dangerous animal. We also saw tons of bird life... great white egrets, purple herrons, fish eagles, kingfishers. Then, it was THE highlight of the day. We saw an entire herd of elephants crossing the river and giving themselves mud baths on the other side. It was amazing. The baby elephants would hold on to the tail of the big elephants with their trunks as they swam across. It was awesome. There are 45,000 elephants in Chobe so this was just the beginning. After about 3 hours on the water, we stopped at a sweet 5 star safari lodge for lunch. Jerry and I were in heaven. They had avacados, fish, steak, lamb... so much great food. And we definitely hadn't been eating $30 meals in Africa thus far. They even had a dessert buffet. Sigh. After the best meal of the trip, we set off for a 3 hour game drive. We saw elephants (tons and tons), impala, kudu, giraffes, water buffalo... and for the grand finale... some female lions taking a nap after a kill. But, it turns out they weren't really napping. We were about 15 feet from the lions and one got up and started walking straight towards the vehicle. The driver had a big 'oh shit' moment and we were speeding off. Jerry has a picture with the lion just feet away from him. It definitely wasn't hungry though... just wanted us to leave it alone. On our way home we saw some zebras... so we basically saw all the animals in the park except leopards. Next time!

       Yesterday Jerry and I went white water rafting on the mighty (the locals always qualify the river with some kind of superlative) Zambezi River. We did 15 of the rapids with names like 'washing machine,' 'terminator 2,' and 'oblivion.' We had a great time and the only time we ended up in the water was the beginning of the trip when we were practicing how to rescue someone out of the water. Our boat was one of the only ones not to flip or lose anyone. So that was good. Actually the roughest part of the trip was probably the hike down into the gorge and the hike back out. It wasn't exactly what I would call a trail. We had a great group in our boat, an older couple from Holland and a couple of girls from Minnesota. It was definitely one of the most fun days we have had so far... makes me want to go rafting in Colorado when I get home. We're crossing the river to Zimbabwe today and hopefully setting up a safari in Hwange National Park before heading back to Johannesburg to catch our flight. Our goal is to see a lion chasing a zebra. Should be fun!

       Jerry and I are in Livingstone, Zambia and today we went to see the amazing Victoria Falls. "The smoke that thunders" is the literal meaning of the Zambian word for the falls. Of course, the British had other ideas for the name! Vic Falls is where the Zambezi river that goes along the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia turns into a huge waterfall as the river falls into a canyon. It was really amazing. We walked along the canyon overlooking the falls and got literally soaking wet with the "showers" that come from it. Then we went hiking down to the bottom of the gorge (and back up again... whew) and over to the bridge between Zimbabwe and Zambia for another view. Tomorrow we are probably going to do a day-long rafting trip. Then we'll be back in Zimbabwe to see the falls from the other side and off for a safari!

       So, in Southern Africa the staple food is a ground maize heated with water that is a kind of cream of wheat consistency. In South Africa it is called pop, in Zimbabwe sadze, and in Zambia sheema. We've been having it for almost every meal and it is really pretty good (with salt). Then, they cook some meat... usually chicken or beef and a spinach-like vegetable with tomato sauce... either rabe or pumpmkin leaves. Sometimes they cook potatoes. For breakfast we have bread, eggs, bacon, and beans. The food is really good here and we have been spoiled with people cooking for us. We've hardly eaten out but at 2 restaurants in the last week. So, now you know what we are eating. It is really a pretty balanced diet except for the dairy... we brought vitamins though.

       Jerry and I arrived in Lusaka on Saturday after our wonderful ride with Eric of Zimbabwe. William came to pick us up at the restaurant where we had lunch and we were off to the University. We stayed with William and his female friend Mundie. On Saturday night William cooked a great dinner for us and we went out to the Lusaka bars. It was just like sixth street... with the nelly, beyonce, and lil kim. On Sunday we went to the cultural village where they make crafts, the city market, and the national museum. We had lunch with William's aunt and uncle and they gave me a traditional chiyongwa (spelling?) which is like a sarong. Then, we went to meet Fr. Peter, a jesuit priest with a phd from University of Chicago who lives in Zambia and runs a non-profit organization here that William works for. Fr. Peter was amazing and taught us a lot about Zambia and its troubles. His organization is JSTR... they have a website if you want to google it. Later on we had dinner with William's friend Martin's uncle and aunt. Everyone is so hospitable here... making us dinner and talking with us. To end the night we went to see Spiderman 2 at the movies... transporting us back to America. Today we are headed to Livingstone, Zambia to see the falls. It was a great time in Lusaka. Jerry and I have been spoiled to have locals showing us around in Zimbabwe and Zambia the last week.

       So! We got to Kariba and the first thing we did is head to a party. It was a huge buffet and open bar... we met the entire town and it was a lot of fun. We went to have a drink at a hotel afterwards and a hippo came up onto the shore. It was literally 10 feet away from us and Jerry and I were running up the stairs to the pool area. Did you know hippos kill more people than any other animal in Africa? The next day, Kumbie our host, got us a trip on a fishing boat on the lake. He works for a tilapia fishery, the biggest fishery in Africa. We went out for like&nbsp; hours and watched them harvest the fish and enjoyed the view. Kumbie and his friend took us around looking for elephants. We drove around for a while and saw none and then we saw them walking right across the road... like 10 feet from us again. It is such a rush to see the animals that close up. We saw tons of baboons too. The next day we just bummed around Kariba and took a tour of a crocodile farm (associated with the fishery) and the factory... interesting to see how we get our food. Last night there was yet another party... this is definitely a party town. Everyone was so great.

       Hello! It has been since a long time since my last post and so much has happened. We had a hard time getting out of South Africa as all the buses to Zimbabwe were full. Jerry and I spent one day in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, and then took a LONG overnight bus to Zimbabwe. We were stuck for 3 hours at the border as we unloaded everything, went through customs, and reloaded the entire bus. it was 4:30am in the morning too. thank god i was awake since i was still jet-lagged. We arrived in Harare, Zimabwe in the afternoon and went to stay with the family that Jerry stayed with- Itai, Marion, and their son Dillon. We were staying at a swank 4 bedroom apartment and they had a maid/cook. The next day, Itai's brother was driving to Kariba, a town on the lake at the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia. So Kumbie took us to Kariba and we spent 3 days there... it was great. Everyone has been so hospitable. They have opened their homes to us, made amazing meals for us every morning, noon, and night, and shown us around. So friendly!

       This morning Jerry and I crossed the border from Kariba to Zambia. Kumbie and his wife drove us across the border. We got to the other side to find no taxis or buses. So we walked to the town... about 3km. It was a nice day though. The last public&nbsp;bus had already left for Kariba so we found another guy and went to go hitchhike... I know it sounds dangerous. But it was the only way. We were very lucky to get picked up by a wonderfully nice white farmer from Zimbabwe. He was going to Lusaka to get passports for his family to move to Zambia. He told us lots of stuff about politics and development and we had a great conversation for the 2 hr&nbsp;trip. It was&nbsp;tons better than taking a bus. And, he took us out to lunch when we got to Lusaka. I called my friend William and&nbsp;he met us at the restaurant. We are&nbsp;at the University of Zambia for the next few days while we are in Lusaka. No more hitchhiking mom. There is a bus and a&nbsp;train to Livingstone and we already booked our luxury bus back to Johannesburg. So don't worry about us! We're having a great time. People are so friendly and wonderful.&nbsp;

       Jerry and I arrived in johannesburg and were out in the suburbs. Downtown is not very safe so everyone stays out there. I felt like we were in plano because there was a huge mall and mercedes benz dealerships in our neighborhood> it was nice but not real fun. We went to the apartheid museum yesterday which was amazing. But it was really the only thing to do in Joburg so we headed for pretoria and will go to zimbabwe tonight. damn computer has a bad keyboard so i'm going to stop this now. more to come!

       Another long journey as I have now flown 2/3 of the way around the world. That means I have crossed 18 time zones and am jet lagged yet again. I flew from Hong Kong to Dubai and then Dubai to Johannesburg on Emirates airline and it was quite a journey. Back to back 8 hr flights was a killer especially with a 6 hr layover in Dubai. But, the good news is that the Emirates food is so awesome. It was seriously the best airline food I've ever had. They had a menu that you got and appetizers and all this good stuff. It was so awesome. My favorite was the rice pudding with raspberry sauce... yum! I met Jerry really easily at the Johannesburg airport and we whisked off for our hotel. No delays this time.

       Hong Kong is so awesome! I wish I had more than one day to spend there. It is such a beautiful city and definitely ranks in my top 3 of favorite international cities. I think one of my new law firm criteria should be that they have a Hong Kong office where I can work. After we visited the peak we took a bus down to the Star Ferry and went across the harbor to the peninsula. We went shopping on Nathan St and walked on the Promenade overlooking Hong Kong island and looking at the skyline. Then, I went to dinner with Jenny (who I met at ITU Youth Forum in October) and went to the airport. What a day. But it definitely makes me want to come visit again.

       So I got to Hong Kong after my Ethiopian Airlines flight was delayed 4 hours. Once I got on board that flight I was in heaven though with my American music and some of the best airline food I've ever had. It was a sweet new 767 airplane. Judy and Jane had already set off for the hotel so I was on my own to get into the city. It was unbelievably easy though. Everything is bilingual here in Cantonese and English and the transportation is so efficient and easy. I got from my gate to the hotel in less than an hour. Hong Kong is such a great city... I would move here in a heartbeat. The architecture is great, there are lots of parks, the hills rise above the city, and its right on the water. I wish I was here for more than 1 day! Right now I'm emailing from a free internet terminal (gotta love that) on top of the peak. The peak is the top of the hill on Hong Kong Island. There is a great view of the harbor and the city. Lots to see in 1 day.

       So this morning we caught a cab to the airport with a guy who was either derranged or on crack. He was repeating himself, splashing water on himself, scratching the ceiling, sniffing like his nose itched from the cocaine mainline, and being generally neurotic and annoying. Now I'm at the Bangkok airport. My flight is delayed. I guess it was good thinking to put 1 day between my flights to Hong Kong and Johannesburg. For those of you wondering why I'm going to Hong Kong at all... it is because it was about $500 cheaper to do that than to fly direct from Bangkok. Although ironically my flight from Hong Kong to Johannesburg has a stopover in Bangkok. Gotta go see if I have a gate to hang out at yet!

       So this is an old story, but Judy and I keep telling it and laughing about it, so I thought I'd post it. On our second day of temple viewing in Bagan, we had this old man horse cart driver. He was really gross... he chewed betelnut... a kind of chewing tobacco and his teeth were all rotted and red. He was talking so fast and spitting. He didn't really speak much English but felt the need to demonstrate all of it and teach us a little Burmese. He kept saying, "English speaking- Burma, Myanmar speaking- Myanmar... English speaking- "hello", Myanmar speaking blah blah." He made us repeat after him and he talked so fast it took you three times to get it. He counted for us up to like 20 and taught us a bunch of other simple stuff for like 45 minutes. He was hilarious. It was exhausting though because he talked so fast and we couldn't have our own conversation. But, now every word we learn its like "cambodian speaking "blah", english speaking "blah".

       So Judy, Jane, and I left Ko Chang today and are back in Bangkok before flying to Hong Kong tomorrow. I'm really excited about seeing Hong Kong, even though I'm just there one day before flying to meet Jerry in Johannesburg. So, now to the dirty part... In Ko Chang there were so many old and not so old white western men on "escort" vacations with young Thai girls. It was really sickening. Its one of those things that maybe that is going on under your nose in America, but it is so obvious here that you have to take notice. Maybe it wasn't quite as bad as being in Bangkok and seeing old men with young Thai boys.

       Today we hit the beach at the island of Ko Chang. It is the low season here and it isn't that developed either so it is really peaceful. When you look back at the shore from the water you don't see huge hotels and condo complexes which is definitely cool. It should be a great day tomorrow just hanging out.

       So Judy, Jane, and I are spending one night in Chattaburi, Thailand before heading across the water to the island of Ko Chang. We are going to spend a few days hanging out on the beach and it should be great. So Chattaburi is not much of a tourist town and there are no restaurants here that offer an English menu. In the situation of not knowing what to order, we decided to have some street food. Not to mention, the Thais seem to be more keen on street restaurants than real ones... they outnumber brick and mortar establishments by a ton. Furthermore, with the street food you can watch them cook it and make sure it is well done. So we had some roasted corn (very fourth of julyish), chattaburi noodles, and strawberry ice cream. Hopefully we won't get sick. We went vegetarian since it always seems safer given the unrefrigerated state of the meat and seafood here. Judy and I had street pad thai and banana pancakes in Bangkok a few days ago and it was fine. Wish us luck :)

       Today we visited Angkor Wat in Siem Reap, Cambodia. And, we had an addition to our group. Kat Murray's friend Michaela who is working for the State Dept in Phnom Penh came up to Siem Reap to join us. Shout out to Michaela! Thanks for joining us! Angkor was a great civilization in Cambodia from the 9th-12th century and they built amazing temples. The main temple Angkor had to be at least on 10 acres of land. It was huge!! You could climb to the top (precariously) which was awesome. Also, there were what seemed like mile long stone carved murals of Hindu religious scenes which were really amazing. The temples were built when Cambodia was switching from Hinduism to Buddhism so they were a combination of both religions... There were a bunch of temples but they were separated by distance unlike Bagan. Hopefully I'll get some pictures up too. You guys all have to come to Cambodia to see them. Worth the trip!

       So I think I know the real definition of budget travel now. Yesterday Judy and I traveled from Bangkok, Thailand to Siem Reap, Cambodia overland. We started out at 6am with a pleasant train ride to the Thai/Cambodian border. It took about 5 1/2 hours. Then, we took a truck to the Cambodian border. At the border, we reached the Cambodian side at lunch time. Of course, they were not open... have to eat a leisurely lunch. The visa fee is supposed to be $20 but instead they demanded 1000 Thai Bhat which is $25. We of course did not have $50 Thai money since we were leaving the country. But, you could change in no man's land for a huge commission. Luckily, we met up with a couple from Korea and Ireland, and they had enough Bhat. So, we payed them in dollars and we got the visa. At this point, the 4 of us negotiated for a pick up truck to Siem Reap (a 3 hr ride). Bad decision: we paid 1/2 the money up front ($1.25 each). So, then we rode around town for an hour picking up 12 more people. That was 16 people total plus stuff in a pick up truck the size of a Ford Ranger.. small. And it was HOT!!! When we had travelled 1 hr this way, we had to change pick up trucks. Only this time, there were 20 bodies. I thought I was going to die. I was packed in like a sardine with the Cambodians in a really unconfortable seating position. Luckily this story has a happy ending. About 1 hour later and people started getting out... at this point it got significantly more confortable. Then, it started raining, and then it was cool, breezy, wet, and magically our pick up truck had a rain tarp so we stayed drive. It was a real moment when we were all pulling out the tarp and trying to stay dry and the Westerners were smiling and laughing along with the Cambodians about our situation. We arrived to Siem Reap safely. What a journey!

       So after a week in Burma, I have a new appreciation for the following things: 1) western style toilets (enough said) 2) refrigeration (meat lies on tables here in hot markets at 2pm with flies all over it- enough to make me vegetarian for a week) 3) paved roads (one lane dirt road between the biggest cities here... makes for a bumpy and long bus ride) 4) set prices (i am so tired of bargaining) 5) houses with hard walls and real roofs (the people in Burma live in houses woven like baskets from bamboo) 6) shorts (the Burmese men and women wear long skirts everyday)

       So, I thought I would post about some of my observations and not just what I have been up to. One of the most trying things about the last week has been that it seems like everyone here is trying to rip you off. Obviously, anyone needs only to look at me to know I'm a tourist. In Burma, they are always saying, "Ah, American. I make special price for you." You're like... I bet you will. It is really exhausting to bargain for literally everything that you buy, from a taxi ride to the airport to a souvinier at a market. In Thailand, taxi drivers will even come up to you and lie that certain temples you are walking towards are closed. Then they will suggest 5 other temples to see and offer to drive you around. At first, you think, wow is it really a religious holiday? Then you just ignore people and start thinking everyone is lying to you or trying to rip you off. I'm finding that a little disappointing.

       So the last 3 days, Judy and I were in Bagan, Burma. Bagan was a kingdom in the 9th-13th centuries. They built over 2000 religious sites/temples/stupas in probably a 5 mile radius. Literally you turn around and see 25 temples. They were intricately carved, full of fresco paintings, and of course... full of Buddha statues! It was great because you could climb all over the temples and take pictures inside and out. At times, I was thinking, lawsuit waiting to happen, as we climbed up dark passages of steep stairs to the top of a 1000 yr old temple, but it was awesome. Bagan was by far the coolest place in Burma that we visited. Mandalay and Yangon were so dirty and crowded. Also, Bagan was slightly more touristy (although we probably only saw a grand total of 10 other tourists there) so the restaurants had things like coca-cola and beer as opposed to tap water (very bad). Judy and I just took a bus back to Yangon and a flight back to Bangkok. We met up with Annelies and Jane at the airport and will meet them in Siem Reap, Cambodia tomorrow!

       Yesterday Jerry and I went to the Israel Museum and it was just insane. The only way I can describe it is to take about 4 of the Smithsonians in DC and put it into a single museum and then you'll have the Israel Museum. We went mostly to see the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Judaica collection, and the archaeology exhibit for the region... which was all excellent. Seeing the Dead Sea Scrolls was really amazing... for those of you who don't know what they are, they are a collection of Jewish writings from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD that contain among other things an entire set of the Old Testament/Hebrew Scriptures of the bible. Kind of puts the Gutenburg bible to shame... There was lots of other cool stuff. The museum had actually also brought three old synagogues into the museum from Italy, Poland, and India. They had an amazing art collection from old masters to impressionists to modern and contemporary art. They had a temporary exhibit of Turkish artifacts, one of Japanese design, and an exhibit of Russian avant-garde art. Anyways, we wandered around for over 4 hours and didn't see nearly everything. In the afternoon we hiked up to the Mount of Olives past the Garden of Gethsamane and the Gethsamane Bascillica to get a view of the Old City. Today we are going back to Tel Aviv to catch our flight to Istanbul.

       Yesterday Jerry and I arrived in Jerusalem and visited the sites of the Old City. We started at the Tower of David Museum, a museum detailing the history of the city from its origins to modern times. It covered how the city had been influenced by all the different invaders, the Jews, the Christians, and the Muslims. Next we set off to explore the narrow streets of the city. We visited the Western "wailing" Wall, which is the only remnant of the 2nd Jewish temple which was destroyed by the romans in the 1st century AD. It is built on the place where Abraham almost sacrificed Isaac (the site of the 1st and 2nd Jewish temples) and since it is a holy site for Muslims as well as Jews and Christians, the Muslims built a mosque on that site in the 7th century AD... the Dome of the Rock. I was a little upset that we were not able to enter the mosque: "muslims only." It seems to me that Buddhists, Christians, Jews, Hindus and others all let anyone visit their religious sites and I think it is ridiculous that they would prohibit 90% of the world's people from visiting this site. I hate to say it... but it was not their land first. Next, we walked along the stations of the cross avenue to the Church of the Holy Sepulcre which is on the site that Jesus was crucified. The church doesn't belong to any one religion: the catholics, copts, greek orthodox, and others all claim it as theirs. Everyone was allowed in. We are staying at a great hostel and slept out on the roof and could see all the monuments... we woke up to the sound of church bells this morning.

       We arrived in Tel Aviv in the afternoon and were amazed at how efficient everything is here. We easily caught a bus right to our hostel (which was one block from the beach!). We went out to the beach immediately and it was really beautiful. The water was crystal clear and there were just tons of people enjoying the great day. Later that evening, my friend Michael (from the ITU conference in Geneva) picked Jerry and I up with his friend Dima and we met up with my other friend Jenny in Jaffa. We walked along the promenade by the sea and went to dinner at a place with an awesome view of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean. Then, they took us on a driving tour of Tel Aviv. We got out to walk around the plaza where Yitzak Rabin was assasinated in 1995. Tel Aviv is a really great city... lots of beachfront restaurants and bars... I imagine it is a little like Miami although I've never been there. It seems a world away from all the history in this area because it is so new and modern and rich. Thanks Michael, Dima, and Jenny for showing us around!!! We had a great time.

       Jerry and I had a long day yesterday and the day before. We took the overnight bus from Cairo to Taba and crossed the border to Eilat, Israel. Then we took a bus to Tel Aviv. It was a total of 16 hrs of bus riding. We did get to wade in the Red and Mediterranean Seas in the same day... which was cool. We got the third degree at from the Israeli immigration officers. They emptied our bags and x-rayed everything. I wasn't sure if they were going to give me back my electricity adaptors... they took them into a back room. But, we passed the test and arrived in Tel Aviv safely.

       Today Jerry and I are back in Cairo before setting off for the Israel/Egypt border. Tomorrow we will be in Tel Aviv. Today we went to Coptic Cairo- the old part of the city where all the christian churches are dating back to 300 and 400 AD. Mom, you would be happy, we visited some christian churches today. We went to St. Sergius which claims to be built on the site where the holy family stayed when they were in Egypt. We also visited a few other christian churches, muslim mosques, and jewish synagogues that were all built in medieval times in Cairo. The rest of the day we spent shopping at the market in Islamic Cairo and lounging in the air-conditioned luxury of the Intercontinental hotel. Off to Israel!

       Jerry and I are calling this our "vacation" on our "trip." We are spending 2 nights at the Luxor Hilton and basically doing nothing but lying by the swimming pool and watching movies on our satellite tv. It has been great not to get hassled 24 hours a day like it is in the rest of Egypt. Nobody chasing us down to ride in their taxi or buy their pyramid paperweight. As interesting as this country has been, we are looking forward to leaving the hassle.

       Today Jerry and I got up early to go to the West Bank in Luxor. We toured tombs in the Valley of the Kings, the Valley of the Queens, the Tombs of the Nobles and saw the Temple of Hapshepsut... and some other stuff. The insides of the tombs were so amazing... some of them were so well preserved that it was like you were the first one to ever visit. The hieroglyphics were carved and then painted with bright colors. There were frescoes of the Egyptian gods and the afterlife painted on the walls and ceilings. Some even had sarcophogi lying inside. They were so awesome. Tomorrow we are going to go all out one more day on the East Bank... but then we are checking in to the Hilton and lying by the pool and watching satellite tv for 2 days :)

       So, as I said earlier, our tour to Abu Simbel was a part of an armed convoy. In 1997, islamic extremists killed a bunch of foreign tourists and since then, they have stepped up security, kind of. At almost every museum or monument, you go through 2 metal detectors... only they don't go through your bags and if you set off the detector, they just say "no bomb, no knife?" and wave you in. It is really a waste of time. The armed convoy probably did make the trip relatively safe. But, something you realize when you are here is that the security is as much for the Egyptians as for you. After all, one post-9/11 incident where a tourist is harmed and their entire economy could be devastated. It seems like tourism is the only thing these people have going for them. So, I guess they are keeping us safe for their own good.

       Today Jerry and I went on a tour to Abu Simbel. Abu Simbel is a temple Ramses II had carved into a cliff on the side of the Nile and it was completely covered in sand until the late 19th century... and therefore completely preserved. It was a full 240km from Aswan and only 40km from the Sudanese border which is why we left at 330am. Plus, the only way to get there is a part of an armed convoy (more on that later) that leaves at that time. It was really pleasant to visit the temple in the early  morning... it was cool and breezy as opposed to hot and oppressive. Back in the 1960s, Egypt proposed to build the new Aswan dam and UNESCO along with 30 other countries relocated 10 Egyptian monuments, including this one. In other words, they cut an entire 40m tall temple out of a cliff, and moved it to another cliff so that it wouldn't lie under Lake Nasser for eternity. It was a phenomenal job and was well documented at the Nubia Museum in Aswan. You really never would know it had been moved when you see it. There were 4 huge statues in the front and then a temple that was just filled with preserved hieroglyphics... the best we have seen so far. It was unbelievable. Later that day, we visited the Temple of Philae, also moved when the Aswan dam was built. It is on an island and you take a ferry to visit it... it was in a really beautiful setting, but not as impressive as Abu Simbel. Since it was in the open air, and not inside of a cliff, it wasn't as well preserved. Now we are in Luxor and ready for more temple/tomb viewing tomorrow!

       So Jerry and I made it to Aswan on the overnight train and the first thing we noticed is that 1) it is so damn hot and 2) at least these people know AC! The overnight train was so nice... we were in first class and it was so cold. But by 11am when we got off it was already boiling in Aswan. We went to our hotel and got a room with cold AC, something we weren't so lucky to have in Cairo. It gets up to 45c in Aswan which I think is about 115f. Jerry and I went out to Elephantine Island to the ruins and the Aswan Museum but came home at 2pm because we were about to melt. We didn't go back out until 6pm when the Nubia Museum reopened... it opens in the morning and at night... strange. The Nubia Museum was awesome, easily one of the best museums I've ever been to; and I've been to a lot. It was built completely of Aswan pink granite and was so nice. The displays were colorful and informative and the artifacts were well presented and lit... it really did a great job of presenting information about Nubia and it is easily the best museum we've seen here in Egypt. We headed back to the hotel early because we were going on a tour the next morning at 330am! More to come...
