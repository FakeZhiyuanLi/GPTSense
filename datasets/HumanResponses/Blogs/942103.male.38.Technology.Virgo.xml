       Halloween.  The second most commercialized "holiday" of the year.  People crawl out from under everything to get dressed up.  I never really understood it.  Which is why I'm going out this year as a cynical and curmudgeonly system administrator who dreams of telling his users to stick it in their PCI slot.  (If you're not a sys admin, trust me; that one's a hoot.)  Then there's my friend, Eric.  He's an interesting guy.  For very complex values of interesting.   We worked together for a while at a network operations center.  Eric was midnights, I was day side.  We didn't see much of each other when we first started working there and he got some bad advice about me implying I wasn't someone he wanted to associate with.  Ironically, the person he got the advice from was actually someone that no one wants to associate with.  Anyway, Eric and I discovered we had all sorts of interesting aspects of life and personality in common and have become pretty good friends.    Anyway, he made a comment with a vaguely boogerish tone to me today on ICQ that I wanted to share:   Eric (2:29 PM) :  It's all green and slimey and at body temperature, waiting for you.   Eric is gaining a reputation for being quoted in blogs, it would appear.

       Well... This sucks.  I had a nice long post talking about how I liked how the page looked and about color-blindess all finished.  Then, when I went to publish it, I got a database error.  I suppose that you get what you pay for.  I'm really not complaining yet.  I'm a professional geek and I know that glitches happen.  But on the second try???  Bleah.  I'll try to remember to copy the new blog entry to the clipboard before posting it so if the system burps again, it's just a matter of pasting.  No work wasted.    Maybe I'll try again after lunch.  Wendy's again.  Bacon Jr. Cheeseburger with mayo, mustard, and extra pickles; five piece chicken nuggets, BBQ sauce; chili; XL Diet Pepsi.  $4.52.  Maybe the cute girl with the sad and pretty eyes will be working today.

       So I wanted to see what this whole blog thing was about.  I decided to read a random sampling of 10 or 12 blogs from this and other sites.  Of the ones I read, I decided that I could do one that would be at least as entertaining as about half and better spellchecked than perhaps 80%.  I don't guarantee that I'll spell everything right each time or be absolutely grammatically correct, either.  In fact I write in a very conversational tone which frequently lends itself to grammatic license, so there ya go.  I'm most likely doing this the way nearly everyone does at first:  I give a justification for doing what I'm doing, tell how I'm going to do it, and then get into the conversations.  Call me a sheep.  But I'm a self-aware sheep.  I don't really know how often I'll post.  I suppose, as with anything new and shiny, I'll use it frequently at first and then taper off as time goes on and the novelty wears off.  Especially if I realize it's more work than I thought it would be.  I'm a lazy person by nature, so the simpler something is, the more likely I am to use it.  The irony is not lost on me that I'm a systems administrator who deals with computers of all shapes, sizes, flavors, and complexity all day long.  But maybe that's why I like simpler things in life outside of work.  I'm gonna stop now and post this, just to see what it looks like.  A lot like taking a look at those boogers before we flick them away.

       I promise my next entry will have nothing to do with boogers or poop.  It was purely coincidence.    Honest.

       Did you ever stop to wonder how much bodily waste you produce in a lifetime?  I did.  And, it turns out, I produce a lot.  I'll bet you do, too.  Just think about poop for a second (yes, I know "poop" is an infantile term but think about the person who's writing this, as well as the reasons for doing so.).  Anyway, poop.  How many times to you poop in a year?  I go about once a day, on average.  I don't know how close this comes to a standard sampling of mostly healthy Americans, since the people that I've polled look at me really funny and back away quickly.  Anyway, say I miss a few days here and there and go twice in a day here and there.  I'm gonna guess it averages out to about 300 times per year.  Also because 300 is a nice round number, as opposed to 283.  So we have porcelain contemplation about 300 times.  Let's think about a lifetime.  I'm 37 years old.  I know that when I was a baby I was a pooping machine.  I probably skewed the number per year right out the window from 0 - 2, and then got into a sort of toddler/youth routine.  I won't hazard a guess as to frequency, though.  So we'll say that I started my (approximately) 300 times per year pooping routine at about age 18.  So I've been "in the habit" for 19 years now, so far.  I'd hope that I'll maintain my regularity for quite a long time more but, just for the sake of convenience, we'll say 40 years, until 58.  After that, it'll be Metamucil and oat bran time for me.  40 years, 300 times per year.  12,000 times.  That's a lot of contemplation.  As a side note, even with a minimal stay of five minutes, that's 1,000  hours  on the pot!!  Now we have to figure out weight.  Very difficult, as it's always so variable.  But I got a precious few guesses ranging from one half to one full pound per.  So we'll split the difference and say 12 ounces or three-quarters of a pound.  When we grind that through the calculator, we arrive at a figure of 9,000 pounds of poop in 40 years.  4.5 tons.  Amazing when you think about it, eh?    There's also the pee.  But I can't even get into that one right now.  Plus, pee is way more variable than poop.  There's also the toilet paper.  There's a lot of that going through the sewers, too.  The ancient Romans used to use a sponge.  Middle eastern peoples used their left hand (which helps to propogate the stigma of leftys).    But 4.5 tons of poop in 40 years.  I can only imagine the totals if I live to 80.  And people laughed at me when I said I was gonna start writing in a blog.

       More than a month since the last entry.  I'm not one of those "I need to update hourly so I can tell people about what I had for lunch" people.  I write when I feel like it and, I suppose, I feel like it.  Much has happened and a little is new.  I took a 5,000 mile road trip to Phoenix and back all by my lonesome and I liked it.  I'd do it again in a minute, with about as much advance planning as I'd done this time.  Which was very little.    I left on 23 November in my nice rented Dodge Intrepid and set out west.  I chose the southern route as I wanted to go through Oklahoma City.  A friend, Jon Mills, is a grad student at Oklahoma U in Norman, just outside of OKC.  If I could make it there I had a free floor to sleep on.  So in the course of a single day, I put nearly 1,100 miles on me in 19 hours or so of driving.  I don't recommend it unless you're either insane or are stubborn or are really cheap.  You get to decide which two out of three I am.  Got to OKC about midnight local time and pretty much collapsed.  It was a floor to sleep on, sure.  But it was possibly the softest floor I've ever had the pleasure of collapsing on to.  Got up the next day and treated Jon to his first Waffle House experience.  I'm a big fan of 'em and firmly believe that people should really eat there once in their lives.  The food is good, pretty cheap, and the people watching is superb.  Left OKC and headed west again, down Oklahoma and into the Texas panhandle.  Let me just say here that Oklahoma City is as different a place as I could have imagined.  Trees and grass everywhere, very standard midwestern architecture.  Texas is exactly what I thought it would be like.  A lot of open scrub land without much of anything between gas stations.  The roads are well maintained and traffic was pretty light.  They just needed to improve the speed limit.  65 is just too slow down there.  I pegged the cruise at about 73 or so and settled back and listened to the CD and watched the world go by.    I stopped for a late lunch in Moriarty, Texas, at a McDonald's.

       Wow... This is so much fun I haven't entered anything in months; since last year, in fact.  Which doesn't seem like all that long ago.  Yet, I suppose, it is.  I don't know if I can even remember everything that happened on my trip but I did promise myself that I'd write it all out.  So here I'll try to finish some more.  Moriarty, Texas is a small town on the map of Texas in the panhandle.  Texas' panhandle goes north and south, rather than east and west like Oklahoma's.  I've always thought of it as more the upright of the piano but I don't think that sounds quite as ummm... manly as 'panhandle'.  Funny thing here.  I just looked up Moriarty, Texas on MapQuest and find that there apparently is no such place.  There's a Moriarty in New Mexico, but I'm almost positive I stopped for lunch in Texas.  Damn.  It must be a destruction of short term memory, since I thought I'd stopped in Texas when I last wrote here, two weeks after I got home.  Anyway, wherever it was I stopped, there was a McDonald's.    I ordered my lunch, which I remember was a Big Mac.  I was jonesin' for a Big Mac for some reason and kept driving until I saw a Mickey's on my side of the highway which was quite a while as most of them were on the other (north) side.  So I'm standing there, waiting for my Mac to be made (no onions, light lettuce), when in walks what I can only describe as being "trailer trash" personified.  She was wearing a thin babydoll tanktop that showed way too much of her middle.  While not fat, really, she certainly had enough extra that the part not covered by cloth was coming out for a peek around.  She was also richly tattooed around her chest and arms and upper back.  There were probably more but I was trying to keep my brain from imagining those possibilities by digging my fingernails into my palms.  She had the quintissential "skank" look all around.  She walked into the McDonald's clutching a greasy McDonald's bag and asked to see the manager.  When the manager (a nice girl, young and, like most young women in that part of the country, married) come up to find out what was wrong,  urlLink Lydia  (my name for her) shoved the paper bag into the manager's face andsaidthatherorderfromlastnightwasallwrongandthey- didn'teatitandshecalledthestorelastnightandthemanager- theresaidshecouldcomeinandgethermoneybackandshesaved- thefoodincasetheydidn'tbelieveherandshedidn'thavea- recieptandshewantedhermoneyback.    Just about like that, too.  The manager looked dumbfounded and I can't say as I blame her.  So she went in back and was looking through the manager's log for any mention of this.  She was being a conscientious person and trying to make sure that the store wasn't getting ripped off.  Now me, having had a long and storied career at McDonald's, would have just given her a refund for what was in the bag just so she'd leave.  But that's why I'm not a McDonald's employee anymore.  By this time I'd been served and I picked a seat which would allow me the best view of Lydia as well as keep me a decent distance from her in case she decided that she was gonna start something which would call for the local law enforcement.  So I sat back and watched while the manager went and looked in the log for a note which explained what was going on.  Apparently she couldn't find such a note and was unsuccessful in getting hold of the manager from the previous night.  Again, in my book, this is going above and beyond the call and I would have definately done whatever it took to get her out of my store.  But the manager was not to be fooled.  She continued to try to find out what was going on.  Maybe she had knowledge that I did not regarding Lydia and her boyfriend, who was waiting in their car.  Amazingly, I finished my lunch before this whole ordeal was closed.  If I hadn't been in a hurry to get back on the road again I might had stuck around to see what transpired.  As I left the store, the manager was on the phone and Lydia looked.... well.... zoned out.  I'll leave you, Gentle Reader, to draw your own conclusions as this was what I was forced to do.  Outside, I saw her male companion.  I'm not sure what his role in this drama was but he was apparently content to sit in the car and smoke and listen to the radio while Lydia fought the good fight inside.  For all I know, they're still there, making argument and counter argument about what to do while the food, the bag, and the counter they're sitting on all become one unified mass which will eventually possess sentience.

       Cool.  I never know what to think of these sorts of things, but this seems to be fairly on the money for me.  I got it from here:   urlLink Mind Media Brain Persuasion Test   Your Brain Usage Profile   Auditory : 40% Visual : 60% Left : 52% Right : 47%  Bob, you exhibit an even balance between left- and right- hemisphere dominance and a slight preference for visual over auditory processing. With a score this balanced, it is likely that you would have slightly different results each time you complete this self-assessment quiz.   You are a well-rounded person, distinctly individualistic and artistic, an active and multidimensional learner. At the same time, you are logical and disciplined, can operate well within an organization, and are sensitive towards others without losing objectivity. You are organized and goal-directed. Although a "thinking" individual, you "take in" entire situations readily and can act on intuition.   You sometimes tend to vacillate in your learning styles. Learning might take you longer than someone of equal intellect, but you will tend to be more thorough and retain the material longer than those other individuals. You will alternate between logic and impulse. This vacillation will not normally be intentional or deliberate, so you may experience anxiety in situations where you are not certain which aspect of yourself will be called on.   With a slight preference for visual processing, you tend to be encompassing in your perceptions, process along multidimensional paths and be active in your attacking of situations or learning.   Overall, you should feel content with your life and yourself. You are, perhaps, a little too critical of yourself -- and of others -- while maintaining an "openness" which tempers that tendency. Indecisiveness is a problem and your creativity may not be in keeping with your potential. Being a pragmatist, you downplay this aspect of yourself and focus on the more immediate, obvious and the more functional

       This is from my friend Heather.  It's a commentary about technology that I think hits the nail on the head:   Most people: "this is not working, I will call someone to fix it." me and You: "This is not working. Why? What if I tried this? Maybe if i do this? Let me see if the help menu can help me. Let me check out the support page on the web. Ok. Now I'm stumped. Where's the phone?"  I blame dependency on technology. We're taught to use a calculator, but not how to add or subtract. We're taught how to use our computers, but not how they operate.  We don't need to know these things, because somewhere out there a computer or machine can do it for us.     Heather is perceptive.  And she rocks.

       Monday Night Football  The game was a bust, the Raiders were getting their butts handed them on a platter. It was 31-10 when I left part way into the fourth. Didn't really have much at stake in the game since I don't really follow either team. I like Jerry Rice, though, so I always hope for a good game for him. He wasn't being used to his potential tonight, unfortunately. Gannon looked like a high school QB out there too at times. I'm not quite sure how they made it to the Superbowl but they really started falling apart during that game and I think it's continued.  Next week is Green Bay vs. Chicago.  The Bay has fallen on some hard times this season.  Brett isn't as strong as he used to be.  They're opening the "new" Soldier Field, too.  I drove by it when it was nearly done about six months ago.  It's hideous.  They just bascially kept the outside walls of the old Soldier Field and built a new stadium inside.  That's all fine and good except there's no cohesiveness to bind the two together.  It just looks like.... well.... they built a new football stadium inside an old one and forgot to take the walls down.  The good thing is that it's a classic matchup of two old NFL teams.  They're part of the Black and Blue Division, which Detroit is also in.  They tend to play a much more agressive style of football and they have a long rivalry extending back 70 or so years.  Plus, they both sort of suck so the matchup will be a little more even.  I'll predict Green Bay takes this one.  GB 28 - Chi 17.

       There are times I just can't figure out how the hell bands come up with names..... "Dude... what would be a good name for a band?" "Well... it's a metal band... we'd better have the name 'Dead' in there somewhere." "Yeahhhh.... and, like, we've got soul, so we should put that in!!" "Duuuuuude... this is some gooood shit!!  Where did you get it??" "Cut it out.... we're naming the band!.... What else?" "Well... we're, like, primitive and shit.... Like on Survivor, where that guy ran around naked." "Yeah, they have two tribes... So we should be a tribe, cause we'd kick their ASS totally!!!" "Dude... This is some REAL good weed!!  Stop bogarting my bong!!" "Dude!!  Shut up and listen!!" "How about 'Tribe of Dead Souls'?" "Excellent!!"  ***** cut to next day *****  "Dude... I was soooooo stoned last night!!" "Yeah, we could tell... But only until we got high, too!" "Yeah... what did we decide on the name of the band??  You guys remember?" "There was 'Dead' in the title... and I think 'Soul'... and, what, 'Survivor'?" "No, man... 'Tribe'!!  That was mine!!  Rock on!!" "Yeah... "Dead Soul Tribe".... That must have been it." "Dudes!!  We rock!!" "We're gonna be bigger than Lionel Ritchie!!" "Dude... you need more weed!!"  Thus is named the Dead Soul Tribe.

       So tired.  Stupid Monday Night Football.  Why does it have to start at 9pm??  Why can't it start at 8pm?  That hour would make a world of difference.  I know they want to have it start late so the West-Coasties have time to get home/to the bar after work.    Would it be so hard to have it on a one hour tape delay, though?  I mean, they did it for the Olympics, and it's likely that the people watching the game wouldn't cheat.  But even if they did cheat, so what?  That's their problem.    Yep.  One hour tape delay to the west coast.  Let the 2/3 of the American population who doesn't live there get to bed at a reasonable hour.  Last night's game went into OT (A shitty team like the Cowgirls forcing OT.  Imagine.) and it was already a longish game.  I didn't leave Mitch's place until a little after 1am.  I got home, checked my email -- I'm obsessive that way, and went to bed at 1:30.  Then got up at 6am.  Nope.  Not tired at all.  Not me.  If ABC would dictate that these games start at 8pm EST, I would have been in bed at 12:30.  That extra hour can make all of the difference.  To top it off, the damn Cowgirls won it.  WITHOUT A SINGLE TOUCHDOWN.    *SEVEN*   damn field goals.  What kind of a team only makes field goals??  The Cowgirls do, I guess.  OK, I'm done now.  I need coffee.

        urlLink Edward Teller Left Mark on Science, Society (washingtonpost.com)   An amazing man who was a brilliant mind, too.  I think he is best summed up in the following:   In Teller's autobiography "Memoirs: A Twentieth-Century Journey in Science and Politics," Teller said he was often asked whether he regretted having worked on the atomic and hydrogen bombs.  "My answer is no. I deeply regret the deaths and injuries that resulted from the atomic bombings, but my best explanation of why I do not regret working on weapons is a question: What if we hadn't?"

       The building I work in his three elevators.  It's seven floors total, but you enter on the third and fourth floors.  I take the elevator when I'm going more than one flight up.  I take the stairs if I'm going one flight down.  Many times, I take the stairs down all the way.  I have a problem going up because of bad knees and back.  I can do it if I have to and sometimes I do, when I'm feeling good.  Or masochistic.  I can't figure out people who take elevators up just one floor.  They will wait, literally, for minutes.  Two or three at times when the elevators are busy.  (Oh, forgot to mention that one or two are usually broken at any one time)  When the elevator comes, they'll get on, push the button for the floor above and stand there smugly while everyone else on the 'vator stares holes through their skull and dreams about giving them an express ride to the pavement.  I do understand that, because it's a little confusing about how this building is laid out, people might get on the elevator thinking they're on the second or third floor and they want to go to the fourth or fifth.  Then, when the elevator goes up only one floor, they realize their mistake.  That's cool... I've made similar errors.  I harbor them no ill will.    It's the people who do it all the time.  Who are just there, waiting, because it was easier than going to the stairwell and using their legs.  Exercise.  What a concept.  People drive 600 yards to work.  People drive a quarter of a mile to go to a gym so they can walk a mile on a treadmill.  I suppose there will be a time when people will ride their  urlLink Segway  down the hall to wait for the elevator to go up -- or down -- a flight to the next floor.

       Jeanelle is coming in today from Florida.  I haven't seen her for nearly a year.  It's pretty weird, too.  I mean, we still talk on the phone several times a week, even nearly daily at times (800 numbers are nice) but we haven't  seen  each other for a year.  She tells me she's dropped weight; I've dropped about 30 pounds in the last 4 months or so.  It'll be interesting.  Then there's the whole divorce thing to add to the weirdness.  I know it has to be done but it isn't really something I'm looking forward to.  The paperwork is easy enough, since there's no contention between us over property and no kids.  It's just a matter of signing papers.  Tragic.  We're taking Michael to Cedar Point on Saturday and on Sunday we're going to go to Hillsdale to Jimmy's house and have a birthday party for him.  I'm getting him the new Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004.  Funny thing about it -- it's advertised as a "Centennial of Flight" edition, yet is MFS 2004.  The  urlLink centennial of flight  is December 17, 2003.  I suppose it's nitpicking but people today are so unaware of history as it is that I like to see it correctly represented.  Cedar Point should be interesting, since it's only supposed to get up to 55 on Saturday and Michael doesn't tolerate cold all that well... He's going to be a skinny popsicle when we finish up.  Yup.

       I found a site which details the last meals requested by the condemned in Texas:  urlLink http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/finalmeals.htm    Which prompted an email exchange between jen and I.  (I'll spare the details here)  But it did cause us to ponder what our last requests for gastronomic delights would be.  I thought you might like to read them:   jen:   i'd have fettucini alfredo with grilled chicken,  pine nuts, and mushrooms; garden salad with balsamic  vinagrette dressing; fried scallops and clams and ketchup; grilled salmon; potato skins with bacon  and sour cream; mozzarella cheese sticks; vanilla ice cream  with hershey's syrup; and faygo red pop.    Mine:   Prime rib, medium rare, 20 oz., with mushrooms   Greak Lakes trout, broiled in lemon butter   Garlic and cheese mashed potatoes with butter   Sweet corn on the cob   Homemade pumpernickel and white bread   Chocolate malt with extra malt   Coke   Raspberry cheesecake with a raspberry sauce   Double scoop chocolate sundae with marshmallow topping

       I got to see Greer on Tuesday, which was a great and wonderful thing since she's been in Togo since last June.  She came here, as opposed to me going to Togo.  It worked out better that way.  Heather and I met her for dinner at Chili's to catch up on what life is like in a poor west African nation.  It turns out that we've got it pretty good here.  No killing our own chickens for dinner, flush toilets, reliable electricity, no geckos or scorpions in bed, and flush toilets.  (I know I mentioned them twice... but, man!! Flush toilets!!)  Anyway, there was much good chatting and catching up and a huge amount of apologizing over not mailing her.  I need to do better and I realize that but, as I said to Greer, my life is one long boring cycle.  Wake up, convince myself to get out of bed, take a shower, go to work, fix computers, come home, watch TV, go to bed.  The cycle continues in a regular Monday through Friday schedule.  The weekends have a little more variants, in that I don't work but I do watch football.  (And when you're a Lions fan, watching football  is  work.  Anyway, Heather -- who also has a blog  urlLink here  and I agreed that we would regularly send our blog entries to Greer.  Regular readers of my blog (all two of you) will note that I mentioned I was sending her the link to this page for her to read.  Turns out that there's a lot of Internet blocking in the world and this site apparently is so blocked.  Or to could be because the Togolese don't like the word "Booger".    Hopefully Greer will have one more free evening to get together before she goes home (on the Friday after Thanksgiving) and we'll have a chance to chat a little more.  I've missed her.  She's a great person with an outstanding sense of humor.  But she'll be back by next August, only to go back to Michigan Tech to finish her thesis work.  But having her in the same state will be a Good Thing.  I'm also more likely to drive to MTU than to go to Africa.  They're getting flush toilets at MTU sooner.  :)

       I found a car.... Go me!  1994 Crown Victoria, dark forest green is what they call it.  I call it dark blue.  But that's the life of a color-blind person.  Got a good price on it; they knocked $900 off the sticker because it's probably going to need transmission work at some point in the near future.  But beyond that, it's a very nice car.  It's at the transmission shop right now (Haas Transmission, in Dexter.  Recommended, of course, by Steve Steeb) getting a transmission flush and fluid treatment.  Once I get that taken care of, I'll get an alignment -- it steers just a tiny bit to the right -- and there's a star in the windshield that needs patching.  Then I'll treat myself to an early Christmas present and have a decent stereo put in with a CD.  Having the truck with it's CD has spoiled me a little.  Speaking of the truck, I still have it.  Tomorrow I'll have had it for three weeks.  I'm keeping it until they tell me to give it back.  The car is paid for so the money I'll get for the Taurus isn't really an issue.  Plus it won't be an inconvenience to be without a car while I'm getting mine worked on.  The only drawback is the gas cost... That truck sucks it down like there's no freakin' tomorrow.  I don't know how people can afford to drive them.  Speaking of which, the tranny shop called... it's fixed and the shudder is gone.  (For now.  :)

       Much has happened, all of it seeming a blur at times... But we'll go over things one at a time.    Eagles Concert 10/14:   Like I said, it was awesome.  Joe Walsh is a nut, but in a good way.  There were a LOT of songs from the solo works of all of the group but I think Joe had more.  Which is not a bad thing.  His version of "Life's Been Good to Me" was cool.    The death of the Taurus 10/16:   I was working late, preparing for a presentation to a group of kids on the mythology of the constellations.  Coming home on Ford Rd. around 11:45, I saw a guy coming at me flashing his lights.  He was in an SUV so I was slightly below his hood which made the brights that much brighter.  Anyway, I was trying to figure out why he was flashing his lights at me when I saw the deer in the middle of the road.  There was at least one buck and one or two others, though I couldn't tell how many.  I didn't have but a second to react.  I managed to not hit the deer on the front which would have certainly killed him and possibly hurt me if he flipped into the car or caused the airbags to go off.  I hit him on a glancing blow to the front fender of the car.  His chest broke the mirror and his antlers shattered the window.  I spun him around and his hind dented the rear door.  I went into the ditch, where I must have hit something that broke the radiator on the bottom since that all leaked out and steamed everywhere.  I thought for a minute the car was on fire.  Not a good feeling!!  So I got to make my first insurance claim ever.  22 years of being a licensed driver.  The good thing was that I got rental insurance a year or so ago, so I have a nice 2003 Dakota Quadcab coutesy of AAA.  They haven't told me how much they're going to give me for it.  I have 30 days of rental coverage on it, so they'll have to do something by Thursday the 13th of November.  I'm not too impressed with their quality of service.    The search for a new car 10/17 - 11/??:    I've found many cars, mostly Tauruses (Taurii?), Crown Victorias, and Grand Marquis, all reasonably low mileage, for around $5000.  This plays well into my plans for a fairly cheap car which will get me around for a few years at least while I get a house.  Right now the front runner is a Crown Vic from Stu Evans Lincoln Mercury which is beautiful in all ways.  But.  It might need a new transmission.  Which is not a Good Thing�.  It's being checked by my mechanic and transmission guy today.  They'll decide for me what the final answer is.  Shopping for cars is fun when you DON'T need one.      Thanksgiving 11/27:   I have football to look forward to.  Sis is making dinner for me and I'll go there and eat and watch TV and be lonely.  Bleah.

       I recently talked about the last meals requested by inmates in the Texas Penal System.  It seems that the website I found which gave the information is being removed because of public outcry.  I say bullshit.  That's just TOO "PC".  These are simple  PUBLIC RECORDS  the state of Texas lists.  The article I read even mentions that this is the #1 question asked of the officals there.  Makes me wonder how many people really  did  complain.    Grr.  It disturbs me that this sort of information, which is something a lot of people are curious about, is being made difficult to find out just because a few people find it disturbing.  (Fortunately, they will still give you the details if you contact them and ask because, after all, this  is  public record.)  Here's a news flash, people:  If you're offended by something, don't look at it.  From Robert Mapelthorpe's   urlLink Piss Christ   to  urlLink swaskitas  which appear in Microsoft fonts derived from Japanese font sets, where the symbol is associated with luck.  If it offends, don't look.    We cannot censor that which makes us uncomfortable.  We cannot pretend history doesn't exist.  If that happens, we become nothing more than a contemporary  urlLink Stalinistic  state which eliminates that and those who we find offensive and unpallatable.  The swastika, in it's context, can be a symbol of evil or luck.  Let us teach the difference between them.  By the way, if you want the list of last meals, I copped it from Google's cache.  Get it now before it expires or email me.  Link to the right.

Phillips, Howard - Constitution   (19%)    Go here to take the quiz and see your choices:   urlLink SelectSmart.com 2004 Presidential Candidate Selector   I was a little disappointed to see my personal preference, Wesley Clark, at #6.  But discounting my ideal candidate and the Libertarian candidate as very unlikely possibilities, Wes moves up to #4.  Taking out Dean as the likely candidate for President, Wes moves up to #3 behind Edwards and Kucinich.  That leaves him on the short list for VP, which is a good thing.  A Dean/Clark ticket would get my vote any day.

       I encourage everyone to go and provide a can of soup to those who are in need.  You can do it from your computer by visiting the  urlLink Chunky website .  Click on your favorite team (the Lions, of course) and Campbell's Soup will donate a can to charity.  They'll donate 5,000,000 cans of soup in the end.  This, of course, is just a gimmick and a fun game.  I was happy to see the Lions are 14th out of 32 teams, with 63,487 cans/votes.  The Green Bay Packers are in total domination, having garnered nearly 400,000 cans/votes.   I guess if it can't be my beloved and maligned Lions, it should be the Pack.  So go vote for the Lions!!  Now!!

       This came across one of the lists I'm on and I've saved it for a long time.  Though this is actually a piece of prose and not a legal document, it still touches upon a lot of the things that people should think about in their lives beyond the material.  An article discussing the history of the "will" can be found  urlLink here .   The Will of Charles Lounsberry Made While He was in the Asylum at Dunning   I, Charles Lounsberry, being of sound and disposing mind and memory, do hereby make and publish this, my last will and testament in order, as justly as may be, to distribute my interests in the world among succeeding men.   That part of my interest, which is known in law and recognized in the sheep-bound volumes as my property, being inconsiderable and none account, I make no disposition in this, my will. My right to live, being but a life estate, is not at my disposal, but these things excepted, all else in the world I now proceed to devise and bequeath.   ITEM: I give to good fathers and mothers in trust for their children all good little words of praise and encouragement, and all quaint pet names and endearments, and I charge said parents to use them justly, as the needs of their children shall require.   ITEM: I leave to children inclusively, but only for the term of their childhood, all and every, the flowers of the field, and the blossoms of the woods, with the right to play among them freely according to the customs of children warning them at the same time against thistles and thorns. And I devise to children the banks and brooks and the golden sands beneath the water thereof, and the odors of the willows, that dip therein and the white clouds that float high over the giant trees. And I leave to children the long, long days, to be merry in, in a thousand ways, and the night, and the moon, and the train of the Milky Way to wonder at, but subject, nevertheless, to the rights hereinafter given to Lovers.   ITEM: I devise to boys all the usual, idle fields and commons where ball may be played; all pleasant waters where one may swim; all snow-clad hills where one may coast; and all streams and ponds where one may fish, or where, when grim winter comes, one may skate, to have and to hold these same for the period of their boyhood. And all meadows, with the clover blossoms and butterflies thereof; the woods with their appurtenances, the squirrels and the birds and echoes and strange noises, and all distant places which my be visited, together with the adventures there found. And I give to said boys each his own place at the fireside at night, with all the pictures that may be seen in the burning wood, to enjoy without let or hindrance, and without any encumbrance or care.   ITEM: To lovers, I devise their imaginary world with whatever that may need, as the stars of the sky, the red roses by the wall, the bloom of the hawthorn, the sweet strains of music and aught else they may desire to figure to each other the lastingness and beauty of their love.   ITEM: To young men, jointly, I devise and bequeath all boisterous, inspiring sports of rivalry, and I give them the disdain of weakness and undaunted confidence in their own strength. Though they are rude, I leave to them the power to make lasting friendships, and of possessing companions and to them exclusively, I give all merry songs and brave choruses to sing with lusty voices.   ITEM: And to those who are no longer children, or youths, or lovers, I leave memory, and I bequeath to them the volume of the poems of Burns and Shakespeare and of other poems, if there be others to the end that they may live the old days over again, freely and fully without title or diminution.   ITEM: To our loved ones with snowy crowns, I bequeath the happiness of old age, the love and gratitude of their children until they fall asleep.

       Nicked, as usual, from my friend celtie.   urlLink     urlLink Which Historical Lunatic Are  You ?    urlLink From the fecund loins of Rum and Monkey.     You are Nicola Tesla, inventor of the Tesla Coil!   A minister's son from Simljan in Austria-Hungary, you were precocious from an early age. At three you could multiply three-digit numbers in your head and calculate how many seconds visitors to your home had lived. In awe of your older brother Dane, you shot a pea-shooter at his horse, causing it to throw him and inflict injuries from which he later died. This tragedy haunted you ever after. You frequently suffered bouts of illness with hallucinations throughout your life. During one affliction of cholera, you encountered the writing of Mark Twain, with whom you were later to be close friends. Later, another, this time mystery, illness inexplicably heightened your senses to a painful extent, only relenting when you hit upon the idea of the alternating current motor.   You developed an aversion to human contact, particularly involving hair, and a fear of pearls; when one would-be lover kissed you, you ran away in agony. Later, you insisted that any repeated actions in your day-to-day life had to be divisible by three, or, better yet, twenty-seven. You would, for example, continue walking until you had executed the required number of footsteps. You refused to eat anything until you had calculated its exact volume. Saltine crackers were a favourite for their uniformity in this respect. In the midst of important work, you forgot trivial details such as eating, sleeping or, on one memorable occasion, who you were.   Your inventions, always eccentric, began on a suitably bizarre note. The first was a frog-catching device that was so successful, and hence so emulated by your fellow children, that local frogs were almost eradicated. You also created a turbine powered by gluing sixteen May bugs to a tiny windmill. The insects panicked and flapped their wings furiously, powering the contraption for hours on end. This worked admirably until a small child came along and ate all the creatures alive, after which you never again touched another insect.   Prompted by dreams of attaining the then-ridiculed goal of achieving an alternating-current motor, you went to America in the hope of teaming up with Thomas Edison. Edison snubbed you, but promised fifty thousand dollars if you could improve his own direct-current motor by 20% efficiency. You succeeded. Edison did not pay up. It was not long until you created an AC motor by yourself.   Now successful, you set up a small laboratory, with a few assistants and almost no written records whatsoever. Despite it being destroyed by fire, you invented the Tesla Coil, impressing even the least astute observer with man-made lightning and lights lit seemingly by magic. Moving to Colorado Springs, you created a machine capable of sending ten million volts into the Earth's surface, which even while being started up caused lightning to shoot from fire hydrants and sparks to singe feet through shoes all over the town. When calibrated to be in tune with the planet's resonance, it created what is still the largest man-made electrical surge ever, an arc over 130 feet long. Unfortunately, it set the local power plant aflame.   You returned to New York, incidentally toying with the nascent idea of something eerily like today's internet. Although the wealthiest man in America withdrew funding for a larger, more powerful resonator in short order, it did not stop you announcing the ability to split the world in two. You grew ever more diverse in your inventions: remote-controlled boats and submarines, bladeless turbines, and, finally, a death ray.   While whether the ray ever existed is still doubtful, it is said that you notified the Peary polar expedition to report anything strange in the tundra, and turned on the ray. First, nothing happened; then it disintegrated an owl; finally, reports reached you of the mysterious Tunguska explosion, upon which news you dismantled the apparatus immediately. An offer during WWII to recreate it was, thankfully, never acted upon by then-President Wilson. Turning to other matters, you investigated the forerunner of radar, to widespread derision.   Your inventions grew stranger. One oscillator caused earthquakes in Manhattan. You adapted this for medical purposes, claiming various health benefits for your devices. You found they let you work for days without sleep; Mark Twain enjoyed the experience until the sudden onset of diarrhoea. You claimed to receive signals in quasi-Morse Code from Mars, explored the initial stages of quantum physics; proposed a "wall of light", using carefully-calibrated electromagnetic radiation, that would allegedly enable teleportation, anti-gravity airships and time travel; and proposed a basic design for a machine for photographing thoughts. You died aged 87 in New York, sharing an apartment with the flock of pigeons who were by then your only friends.   Ridiculed throughout your life (Superman fought the evil Dr. Tesla in 1940s comics), you were posthumously declared the father of the fluorescent bulb, the vacuum tube amplifier and the X-ray machine, and the Supreme Court named you as the legal inventor of the radio in place of Marconi. Wardenclyffe, the tower once housing your death ray, was dynamited several times to stop it falling into the hands of spies. It was strangely hard to topple, and even then could not be broken up.

       This is a pretty cool site... allows you to enter the states you've visited and it generates a map of them:            urlLink create your own visited states map  I plucked it from  urlLink Eric's blog , over on LJ.  My criteria for "visiting" a state is, 1) Sleep in it.  2) Drive the long axis of it.  I've never stayed overnight in Georgia but I've driven the long length of it four times on my way to and from two visits to Florida.  Likewise Nebraska.  I haven't spent much time in Iowa, except to drive the width and stay in Des Moines overnight.  But these all qualify.  Setting aside those rules, add Arkansas, Mississippi, West Virginia (driven through part of and no overnights) and New York (for the 1981 International Band Festival but we stayed in Niagara Falls, Canada) for all of the states I've set a physical foot in.  No new states immediately on the horizon; though if Jen decides to go to  urlLink grad school  in California (San Diego) :( , I'll be the one driving the van there and back.  So much for my vow to never go to southern California.  I'm considering a four day weekend at some point, to go to the U.P. so I might zip into Minnesota for a little recon which may or may not end up counting, depending on what we find there.

       John Walker was one of the founders of AutoDesk, makers of the industry-standard AutoCad program.  He's retired now, having made a boatload of money, and spends his time living leisurely.  He has a most excellent web space set up and it's unusual in that it's more infomative than flashy.  You can see the  urlLink home page here .  He's got just boatloads of cool content there.  He's really into astronomy and put together an amazing guide on weight loss.  He also has a reading list  urlLink here .  The purpose of this post is to focus on this section.    This man reads  a lot .  I went through his list and added six or seven books to my  urlLink Amazon Wish List .  (Feel free to buy me something from it.  :)  If you do, and you go there from John's reading list, he'll get a little bonus money.  Spread the wealth if you can.  Anyway I thought this would be a good place to list books that I'm reading.  I certainly won't have the quantity of John's list; he has seven listed for January and it isn't even the end of the month!  I likely won't have the quality, either, since I still have childish and purulent interests aside from my intellectual and scholarly ones.  Daddy always said to keep your interests broad!  :)  I just checked out Stephen Ambrose's  urlLink Nothing Like it in the World  from the library.  I'm a huge Ambrose fan and definately looking forward to reading it.  It's the story of the building of the transcontinental railroad as told in Ambrose fashion.

       Sometimes its hard to ponder life without trying to get all deeply philosophical and self-analytical.  I come from a very small family.  That's one of the drawbacks to having parents who are older from the start.  When I was born, mom was nearly 40 and dad was nearly 50.   All of my grandparents were born in the ninteenth century.  My mom was an only child and my dad had one brother.  In a time where many children was the norm, I end up in a family who are the poster children for the  urlLink Negative Population Growth  society.  My parents produced three children: me, Jim, and Sue.  Jim died in 1986 without any kids.  I'm 38 and still kidless (of my own; I still consider Michael my son even though Jeanelle and I are divorced).  Sue has kept the genetic fires burning with Mitchell and McKenzie.    From my earliest memories, I was told how it was up to me to keep the Topping name alive.  My dad's brother only had a daughter and my great uncle Arthur never had any children of his own.  There was a chance that my brother would get married and have kids but because of his medical problems it was unlikely.  That left me as the "man".  The carrier of The Name.  No pressure, either, right?  Right.  Anyway, so I start out in life with little doubt that I'd have kids eventually.  I was a slow starter in the marriage biz but I was still in my early thirties and my wife was still in her early thirties and she had a son from a previous marriage, so it shouldn't be a problem, right?  Right.  Suddenly I find myself in a position I didn't plan on:  Being in my late thirties and kidless and wifeless.  So now I think about the possibility of not having kids.  And it gnaws at me.  Continually.  I WANT kids.  I WANT to be a dad.  It isn't even about carrying on the name, though that's a nice bonus as I'm very proud of who I am and of my history.  But I don't have kids and I don't know if I will.  I'm not getting any younger and I don't find many 25 year old women wanting to throw themselves at a man who's closer to middle age than to college age.  I've had two offers, one quite serious, from friends who are willing to be a surrogate mom for me to help me be a dad.  Obviously it's a possibility but I would first very much love to try to have kids (and a family) in the more traditional way.   Lest ye think this is one of those angst-ridden "oh, woe is me" posts, it isn't.  It's just that I'm suddenly wondering what I'll do if I don't get to do the thing I've been planning on doing for most of my life.  There's also a certain loneliness factor there, too, like just totally ending up alone but I don't really think that'll happen.  I have too many friends.    Man, that muse returned with a vengeance!!

       It's a couple days later now.  My inspirational cup isn't exactly running over with noteworthy thought but it isn't bleak and desolate for now.  Maybe my muse finally tired of Mai Tais and Yahtzee and is back at work, albeit hung over.  One thing that's kind of worrying me about going back to school is the actual school part of it.  I've taken a couple of classes  urlLink here and there  since my days of  urlLink Master's work  at EMU but they were fluff classes without much depth.  I'll have to actually produce thoughtful insight on a regular basis and that kind of worries me.  I mean, I can spew drivel all day with the best of 'em but to be meaningful requires actual thought and actual effort.    The application to MSU requires a writing sample and I've been trying to figure out what the best form of writing would be.  Poetry is right out.  I don't think a fictional piece would be well-received either, unless it had something to do with popular culture.  That pretty much leaves standard non-fiction research.  They're also vague (read: nonexistant) with guidelines for length of said research.  In fact, this is the extent of their instruction about this particular task:   One writing sample is required from each applicant. This sample should document your writing and thinking skills, but it does not necessarily have to be an "academic" paper.    Not much there.  I have time to figure it out, though.  I know the Ph.D. will be worth it but there's a lot of hassle.  I mean, expecting me to think!!!  I wonder if I could get away with a blank paper with the single phrase,    urlLink Cogito ergo Sum  ,  on it.  I mean, it shows I think and that I can be succinct with my writing and still get the point across.  The drawback is that it also shows I plagarize.  They might be a little chuffy about that part.

       Didja ever have one of those days where you wanted to write, where you felt like you  needed  to write, but when you sit down to do just that, nothing comes out?  My mind is a painting right now:  "Polar Bear in a Blizzard".  It's just that blank.  Blanker than normal.  Sometimes at least it has pretty colors and random pictures.  Not today.  Just pure white.    Bleah.  The muse who was upon me to write has kicked me in the ass, laughing, while she goes off to the bar for Mai Tais and Yahtzee.   Maybe later, then.

       I have a routine.  When I get in my car after work, I switch the radio over to 1600 from its normal spot at  WWJ-950.  The afternoon drive guy there, Ken Kelly, is pretty funny with a dry and sarcastic wit.  He also weaves in some amusing bits of trivia and wry insight on life in general.  In other words, he's a lot like me.  I've talked to him three or four times, too, when I've called in and he seems like a pretty good guy on top of it.  On Monday, I tuned in as is my habit, only to find some wacky talk radio show on.  It was curious, since usually when Ken is off they put in a swing/big-band music show.  I thought it was odd that they would put in a talk radio show instead.  So, because I'm a curious sort, I called the station and asked if Ken was off sick today.  I was informed that he no longer worked for the station and they would be replacing his show.  I was so surprised by this that I was only able to stammer out that I was very unhappy with this and I hope they were keeping track of the callers.  The girl who answered the phone said they were indeed and I was, by no means, the only upset caller.  So I ran across  urlLink this article  today as well as  urlLink this one  which explain what happened.  In the latter article, Catherine Kalman, the former general manager of the station who was fired at the same time, said she "hoped the station would retain a community focus".  Since the station is now owned by a Dallas, Texas based broadcast company I don't have much hope for that.  It sounds like Catherine feels the same way.  WAAM was Ann Arbor's last widely listened to and independently-owned radio station.  Three others, WWWW (formerly WIQB) 102.9, WQKL 107.1, and WTKA 1050, are owned by mega-corporation  urlLink ClearChannel .  ClearChannel is continuously (and for the most part rightly, IMHO) being  urlLink criticized  for supressing programming that is original and innovative and dictating strictly what gets played and what doesn't..  That's not very condusive to being independent and giving a lot of freedom to your personalities.  I liked WAAM because of thier independence.  Whitehall Broadcasting was an Ann Arbor company.  To the best of my knowledge, they only owned WAAM (since 1983) and the personalities there had tremendous loyalty to the company and the owners.  Ken was there for 15 years and Ted Heusel has been on Ann Arbor radio for 53 years.  He had only a one-hour show, from 11am to noon but it was still interesting.  Ted hasn't been fired, really, but he's been offered a one hour show on Saturdays which seems kind of a slap in the face.    I'm trying to find an email address for Ken to let him know how much I enjoyed his show and how outraged I am at his being let go.  WAAM may be trying to change their format but I won't know about it.  I no longer listen to them.  If they hire Ken back, I'll listen again.

       I thought that  all  of the  urlLink Mid-American Conference  schools had reciprocity agreements about tuition.  Or at least the Michigan and Ohio schools did.   urlLink Eastern  does;  if you're an Ohioan, you pay  urlLink Michigan resident  rates to go to EMU.  Well that's cool, thinks I.  I can go to  urlLink Bowling Green  and enroll in their  urlLink Popular Culture program  which is nationally known and highly respected.  But boy -- was I  wrong .  Turns out it isn't every MAC school, just the ones who want to do it.  And BGSU doesn't, apparently.  So the  urlLink per credit hour  cost of $776 for graduate credits translates to nearly more than $4700  per semester .  Nearly $10,000 per year.  I just ain't a-gonna pay that kind of coin.  I can't afford it right now.  But there is hope yet.   urlLink Michigan State University  has a very good program in  urlLink American cultural studies .  I didn't really delve deeply into it since I thought, "Hey, Big Ten school, Big Ten prices!" but I was a little mistaken there.  Big Ten school, not-so-bad prices.  I can go there for a much lower cost than BGSU.  The  urlLink basic cost per credit hour  is only $291.  According to their nifty  urlLink budget calculator , I can take 6 credits at MSU for only $2,150.  Much more in-line with my financial ability.  And, hey, a Big Ten school in my home state with my alma mater's colors.  Synergy.  I can deal with it.  Now to do some research on the application process.  GRE, here I come.

       I got a response from the people who do Christopher's show.  I'd posted a message on his forums asking for the epilogue to the show and I got it this morning in an email:   Responding to life's changes is never easy. We have this idea about how we want our lives to go -- as if we really have control of what's coming down the pike. We tend to look at sudden change as setbacks because it wasn't what we had in mind. We want change as long as everything remains the same. We complain that we're not getting where we want to go, but have no intention of leaving where we are.  And yet our very purpose here is to grow and effect change. Life hands us opportunity every day to make a difference. When we dismiss those opportunities - usually because of fear of the unknown - we feel hollow. That empty feeling turns to anger and before we know it, it's everybody else's fault that we're not moving forward, having the life we think we deserve.  Life can be so rewarding but let's not confuse "reward" with "comfort". Change is often uncomfortable but necessary to helping us re-prioritize, re-commit and redefine who we've been to leave room for the extraordinary life we thought we'd never get. Make change! You can do it!  That's pretty damn inspiring.  And true, to boot.

       It's the new year and I remain vaguely disconcerted.  I'm not entirely sure what I want out of life but I grow more confident each day that passes that it isn't to be a systems administrator forever.  I mean, I like what I do for the most part but I don't like that there isn't a reward to what I do in the end.  Usually, it's a case of, "Thanks for fixing that problem for me.  Here's another one while you're here".   If there's no computers going wonky, I'm invisible.  If there are, I'm on the hot seat.  It is neither rewarding nor satisfying.  Heather continues to provide inspiration for me.  She quit her job in early December in order to concentrate on getting her candle-making business (Heather's Illuminables) off the ground.  She didn't have any alternate employment lined up, yet she did it anyway.  Now she's working as a receptionist at a church only a ten minute drive away (compared to an hour plus drive at her previous job) and has time to concentrate on that which is important to her.  The difference between she and I in this case that prevents me from following him her path is that she has no outstanding bills (car payment, student loans, etc.) whereas I do.  While I don't necessarily want to enter the exciting world of candle-making and selling, I want to do something creative.  I want to work with my mind.  I keep on talking about getting a Ph.D. and then doing nothing about it.   I can do it.  I can get the degree.  But am I motivated enough about it?  There are days where I am and days where I'm not.  Today, clearly, is a day where I am.  I just have to make sure that the days I am motivated are greatly outnumbering the days where I'm not.  Taking a look at the current and past  urlLink UM job postings  gives me further impetus to pursue this.  There are positions that I can fill at all three campuses.  I don't mind a long drive if it's to a job I like.  But even a walk across the street can be torture to get to a job I don't like.  There are at least thirteen institutions of higher learning, both at the four-year and community college level, within an hour's drive of me where I can teach and do research.  I guess what it boils down to is making decisions.  Preparing for change.  The signs have been there for a while but I have to let myself see them.  I've been reading a lot of  urlLink Stephen E. Ambrose's  work recently.  Today, while reading   urlLink The Victors   I came across the follow quote that's kind of sticking with me:   [Talking about his sophomore year at college]  Also that year, I took a course entitled "Representative Americans" taught by Professor William B. Hesseltine.  In his first lecture he announced that in this course we would not be writing term papers that summarized the conclusions of three or four books; instead, we would be doing original research on nineteenth-century Wisconsin politicians, professional and business leaders, for the purpose of putting together a dictionary of Wisconsin biography that would be deposited in the state historical society.  We would, Hesseltine told us, be contributing to the world's knowledge.  The words caught me up.  I had never imagined I could do such a thing as contribute to the world's knowledge.  Forty five years later, the phrase continues to resonate with me.  It changed my life.  At the conclusion of the lecture -- on George Washington -- I went up to him and asked how I could do what he did for a living.  He laughed and said to stick around, he would show me.  I went straight to the registrar's office and changed my major from premed to history.  I have been at it ever since.      One of two signs that came flashing into my face today.  The other was from, of all people,  urlLink Christopher Lowell .  He's the interior designer on The Discovery Channel.  I hope to find the little epilogue he did for his show today.    This Ambrose quote embodies the kind of excitement I want to have about my job.  Where I can contribute to the world's knowledge.

       I took this test to determine my regionalistic tendencies, but it only differentiates between Yankee and Dixie:   urlLink http://www.chuckchamblee.com/dom/fun/yankee_dixie_quiz.htm   It was fun but there should be categories for midwest, southwest, Great Lakes, etc.  One of the questions does, in fact, have an answer which says "Very common in Michigan".  45% (Yankee). Barely into the Yankee category.

       I finished  urlLink The Devil in the White City  last night.  It was a good read; the story (stories, really) are well told and certainly hold the reader's interests.  But.  There's always a 'but', isn't there?  The book is written in a more disjointed manner than I had hoped.  When I read the blurb on the back it seemed as though the two men's stories were more deeply intertwined than they were.  It begins by alternating chapters; first involving the 1893 Columbian World's Fair and it's planning, surrounding the chief planner and architect,  urlLink Daniel Burnham , then the story of Herman Mudgett, alias H.H. Holmes, a doctor (who graduated from the U of Michigan Medical School, btw) who moved to Chicago to take advantage of the World's Fair and the innocent people, mostly young and single women, who flocked to Chicago.  I had expected that Holmes' and Burnham's paths would have directly crossed or one would have somehow influenced the other's life.  But this wasn't the case.  Larson, the author, admits that they likely never met since they didn't travel in the same social circles.    Larson could have written two seperate books, I think, with much better results.  The 1893 Columbian Exposition was an amazing feat of engineering and human drive.  The desire of the United States in general, and Chicago in particular, to outdo the International Exhibition of Paris of 1889 was plain and simple.  The  urlLink Eiffel Tower  was a marvel of the show and was what everyone spoke of.  The desire to "out-Eiffel Eiffel" was stated many times in the book.  The tales told of the drive to get the Fair to Chicago, the desire of Burnham to make this the grandest fair ever seen -- to the point of hiring the finest architects in the world, including  urlLink Charles McKim ,  urlLink Louis Sullivan , and  urlLink Frederick Law Olmstead , the trials and tribulations of building The White City, so named because all of the important buildings were painted white and to differentiate it from the rest of Chicago, dirty from the coal smoke and the "progress of industry", called "The Black City", in time for the Fair to open, are more than enough to provide a fascinating read on their own.  Likewise, the story of H.H. Holmes (née Herman Mudgett) was a fascinating one all by itself.  Holmes was a man born in New England in 1861 and the archetype, or nearly so, of a predatory serial killer.  He was a charming and personable gentleman, capable of wooing women with his guile and lies, and making men hate him because of that.  He settled in Chicago, near Jackson Park, where the Fair would eventually be built.  Through a web of lies, manipulation, and murder, he was able to build a structure which was a hotel to some and a chamber of death to others.  That Holmes was able to go on for so long doing the things he was doing without raising the curiousity of the Chicago Police or causing the loved ones of the people who disappeared to suspect foul play any more than they did was amazing.  It wasn't even an issue of the police thinking that something was wrong and not being able to figure out what was happening, as occurred a century later with  urlLink Jeffrey Dahmer  and the  urlLink Green River Killer , it was total ignorance on their part.  Holmes, in fact, was quite friendly with the police in the area.  He got away with it for a long time before being arrested for insurance fraud.  It is unknown how many he killed.  At least nine, for sure but the true number is most likely much higher than that.  One newspaper estimated it to be as much as 200 but this number is probably high.  At any rate, it was more than enough to send him to the gallows.  Larson's writing ability is very engaging and he tells a good story.  But I wish it had been done in two separate books, or at least two separate parts of the same book.   Each part could have flowed more smoothly, but mentions of what was happening "on the other side" would have helped tie them together.  Did I enjoy the book?  Absolutely.  Would I read it again, knowing what I know now?  Yeah, probably so.  This book is unlike any he's written up until now.  But I would certainly also give his other books a chance, if the subject matter were as interesting to me as this was.   urlLink Here's a link  to a listing of his books.  But use caution, since Amazon lumps him in with Erik Larsen, illustrator and others.

       When I was little, I used to have a recurring "daymare".  In it, I would be sliding down the bannister of a grand staircase.  It was amazingly long and I would fly down it often.  But suddenly, the bannister would turn into a knife edge razor.  It wouldn't cut me in half, per se, but it would torment me as I slid down.  You'd think I could have avoided this torment by not thinking about it.  But you'd be wrong.  I couldn't stop myself from thinking about it and obsessing about it.  Sometimes I would have the first part of the dream without the second.  Other times I'd have the whole thing.  It didn't seem like there was a pattern to what happened when.    In my adult life I have similar things happen.  When something negative happens to me, I obsess about it.  I go over in my mind all of the negative outcomes.  Everything that can go bad, does.  Even when there are good aspects, the bad and negative outweigh them.  I feel like  urlLink Chris Farley  in  urlLink Tommy Boy , where he's getting discouraged at not being able to sell brake pads to anyone because he sabotages his ability to do so.  If you haven't seen the movie, you should.  It was Chris Farley at his best.  But here's the relevent dialogue.  The setting is in a truck stop restaurant where Tommy and Richard (played by  urlLink David Spade ) are trying to get something to eat but are being put off by Helen, the waitress:   Tommy:  Hey, What's your name?   Waitress:  Helen.   Tommy:  That's nice, you look like a Helen. Helen, were both in sales. Let me tell you why I suck as a sales man. Let's say I go into some guys office and let's say hes even remotely interested in buying something. Well then I get all excited I'm like Jojo the idiot circus boy with a pretty new pet. The pet is my possible sale. Oh , my pretty little pet, I love you. So I stoke it, and I pet it, and I massage it, hehe I love it, I love my little naughty pet, your naughty. Then I take my naughty pet and I go ( makes ripping noises as he tears apart the roll) Uuuuuuh. I killed it. I killed my sale. That's when I blow it. That's when people like us gotta forge ahead Helen, am I right?   Helen:  God you're sick."   Yeah... that's me.  Jojo the idiot circus boy.

       I finished   urlLink The Victors   last night.   While it was a good read, it was a book I could have probably skipped without missing out much on Ambrose's quality.  There are a lot of passages lifted from other books he's written.  Notably  urlLink Citizen Soldiers ,  urlLink Band of Brothers , and  urlLink D-Day: June 6, 1944 .  I wasn't upset about it; it's something that he admits in the book.  And there's never anything wrong with rereading the extraordinary exploits of these incredible soldiers from all of the services on both sides of the battle.  If I didn't like reading it I would have stopped.  I would have probably said even less than I just did about the repetition were it not that I have read all three of the above books in the recent past.  If I were trying to give someone a flavor for Stephen Ambrose and provide a well-written and fairly well-balanced account from the soldier's side as well as the general's of the war in Europe from early 1944 through the end, this would be the book I'd recommend.  I still recommend it for Ambrose's discussions of Eisenhower's thinking and decision-making process.  He was Ike's biographer and privvy to his writings during and after the war.  There aren't many who knew General Eisenhower as well and intimately as Ambrose.  The next book on the list is   urlLink The Devil in the White City  .  This is a novel which intertwines the story of the  urlLink 1893 World's Fair  in Chicago and its architect, Daniel H. Burnham, with  urlLink H.H. Holmes  who was one of the first true serial killers.  Holmes murdered between 27 and 200 people in and around Chicago during this time by posing as a doctor and operating The World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and employing his charm and disguise to lure his victims to their ultimate deaths.

       If you don't read the strip  Big Top  by Rob Harrell, you should.   urlLink Today's strip  was funny and provided me with some memories as well as being thought provoking.  In it, Kingston the Lion is taking Pete, a 10 year old boy who's growing up in the circus, to get some clothes.  He asks the sales person if they have any Toughskins jeans.  For those who don't know, Sears Toughskins were almost a rite of passage in the 1970s.  They were probably the only article of clothing which would have been acceptable wear to attempt to survive an atomic weapon.  I wore them a lot during my formative years.  In "husky" size, please.    Anyway, the salesman sticks his nose up and informs Kingston that they don't carry those and why would he want them, anyway?  Kingston replies that Pete wears the knees of his jeans out really fast because he's always outside running and jumping and climbing.  Kingston asks the salesman what he might suggest as an alternative, to which the salesman replies "Ritalin".  It occurred to me as I was reading this strip that I didn't even know if Toughskins were sold any more.  Not surprising, since I've graduated on to more grownup clothes now.  (Besides, they don't make Toughskins in my size, even "superduper husky".  A perusal of the Sears website shows me that they sadly are not making them any more.  In fact, the only reference to them appears to be the title of a  urlLink Rodney Carrington CD , "Growing Up Poor - Toughskins Jeans".  I got to thinking about why they don't sell them anymore.  Is it because they're out of fashion?  Is it because there are other similar and more affordable brands (which would be surprising, since they seemed to be worn typically by the poor kids)?  Then the comic itself provided a tragic possibility:  That today's children are so medicated with  urlLink Ritalin  and other similar drugs that they no longer wear the knees of their pants out by climbing around.  Isn't that both sad and frightening?  Did you know that Ritalin is identified by the  urlLink DEA  as a drug with a high abuse potential?    The first APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-I), published in 1957, contained no mention of anything like attention deficit disorder.  It was included in the DSM-III, published in 1980, for the first time in anything like its present form.  I don't argue with the fact that there are disorders out there which cause attention deficit.  For those people, I think that medication may be a possible solution.  But I think there are a lot fewer people (read 'children') who suffer from this who are popping pills daily.  Children are interesting creatures; they are the perfect prototypes for scientists.  When they encounter something that interests them whether for the first time or the hundreth time, they devote their attention to it.  If that thing is outside and is more interesting than what the teacher at the front of the room is saying, guess where they're going to be looking?  That's not attention deficit, that's attention priority.    Today's society is filled with more two-income families.  There is little time for children to be children.  Mom and dad are busy shuttling them between daycare, then to soccer practice, then to karate, then to violin lessons, then to whatever is next.  They have nothing but structure in their lives.  This is the antithesis of what being a child is about.  They do these things because they are told to do them by their parents.  And don't fool yourself:  A parent saying "Do you want to take soccer or basketball or karate?" isn't a choice.  The child  will  do something, whether they want to or not.  If little Timmy says, "I don't want to do any of those things.  I want to just play with my friends outside." that is not an acceptable alternative.  Timmy can't play with his friends outside because all of his friends are taking violin lessons or playing soccer or basketball.  Timmy's parents have something to prove to all of the other parents in the subdivision:  That Timmy is a better or more active or smarter kid than any other.    My mom was a stay-at-home mom.  She was there when we left for school -- for that matter, so was dad.  He was a salesman who made his own schedule -- and she was there when we got home from school.  No shuttling anywhere for us.  I was asked if I wanted to try things out:  Basketball at the elementary school.  Cub scouts.  Methodist Youth Fellowship.  I gave them a try.  I didn't stick with any of them except for MYF.  That was fun.  But there was no ultimatum given me when I didn't like it.  There was no pressure on my parents to keep up with anyone or prove their kid was better or more active than anyone else's.   I was a lucky kid.  I grew up in  urlLink the country .  Well, it was the country when I was growing up in it.  There's a Walmart in town now.  What was the country is a bedroom community now.  But growing up in the country was a good deal.  There was plenty of open space and plenty of room to do as I pleased.  There weren't many kids around who were my age so I didn't have a whole lot of friends.  But that wasn't a bad thing.  I read --  a lot .  I played outside.  I did have a few friends nearby who would come over and we'd do all sorts of things that were fun.  And we wore the knees out of our Toughskins.    Big Top is a really good comic and it has some really funny strips.  But I had a hard time laughing about the message that today's strip sent.  That's OK, though.  It wasn't an offensive message or anything that's gonna make me want to write to the editor or anything.  It was, in the end, a sad commentary on the way we treat our children today.

       First, you should read Heather's  urlLink Feb 4th blog entry .  Done?  Good. Pretty good, eh?  Yeah.  She's a smart one, that Heather.  Here's (most of) the email I sent her in response:   Feb 4, 2004 Very thoughtful entry yesterday. Sometimes it's weird how similarly you and I think.  I've had the same sorts of doubts for many years.  You know I don't like the holidays, if not just for the lack-of-family issues but also for the crass overcommercialization of it all.  There's little warmth to Christmas that isn't generated by advertising or retail sales or ulterior motives.  I really hate that.  I don't necessarily subscribe to the standard Christian views about everything and I know that December 25 isn't really Jesus' birthday.  But I think that the basic uncommercialized *ideal* of Christmas -- to be thankful for what you have and your family and friends -- is a sound idea.  But it isn't going to be espoused genuinely by anyone who isn't looking for something to sell.  I like giving presents.  Let's have a day that's just "Present-Giving Day".  Kind of Boxing Day-ish but not so close to Christmas.  Make it in January.  Middle of the month.  On a Friday.  Give the kiddies a day off from school.  Give them all the presents they can break.  But during the Christmas season, no advertising of sales is allowed.  No sappy pleas by Sally Struthers that play on our capitalist guilt to come and give a starving African child a sandwich.  On December 24, 25, and 26, all we do is celebrate each other and ourselves and any gods we may believe in.  Churches are closed except for four hours on December 25.  Apart from that, it's all got to come from within.  No sports, no American Idol stars singing Christmas carols.  Just families staying in and playing games and talking and laughing and maybe even crying.  But it all comes from within.  Yes, I know I'm a cynical curmudgeon.  But it'll still never happen because nearly 25% of this nation's economy is driven by two months in the winter.  Carefully orchestrated and scheduled.  Sally Struthers is waiting in her air-conditioned trailer in Kenya.  Ruben Stoddard and Clay Aiken are standing in fake snow on a set in California.  And Walmart is going to advertise yet another sale.  I think I'll go up north and find some deep snowy woods and stand in the middle of them and listen to the silence.

       Most regular patrons of this journal know that I am, at heart, a person with an unabiding love and passion for history.  I can't get enough of the stuff.  I do computers too but that's just because it's a gig that I can do to pay the bills.  What I want to do for a living is history stuff.  I went up last weekend to MSU with Sandy and her daughter Rin (recently returned -- damaged -- from Navy basic training) to go to the Michigan Stallion Expo.  This is apparently one of the big horsie shows in the midwest.  Sandy was going because she is on the Livingston County Sheriff's Mounted Patrol and had to log some time.  Rin went because she was bored.  I went so I could go to the MSU campus.  I had stuff to do that wasn't horseplay.    I went to the  urlLink American Cultural Studies  department to talk to the chairman and get some information but found out I'd missed him by ten minutes.  That kinda sucked.  But I did end up talking to the department secretary, Kathleen, who was very nice and probably helped me as much as the chairman would have, albeit in different ways.  The cutoff date for applications is December 31 for the following school year so I've missed out on admission for this coming September.  I did find out that I can take classes through the lifelong learning program and have them count to the degree, as long as I coordinate with the department what classes I'm taking.  That's one of the great things about this program:  Since there are so many facets of it, there are a zillion different classes that can be applied.  I'm going to apply to the college and get a catalog and see what I can find.  On another note, Vicki (of  urlLink Lint From My Pocket  fame) and I have decided to start a website to allow "at-large" historians such as ourselves (in other words, history geeks who don't have a history job) to post papers they've written which are scholarly but may not have the depth or sponsorship for inclusion in a journal.  Vicki and I are going to start out by putting up papers we wrote in college and go from there.  Maybe a little discussion forum down the road.  Anyway, that's coming up Real Soon Now.  There won't be much to start with but we hope to advance confidently in the direction of our dream.

       I was catching up on my Dave Barry columns today while installing (for a second time) OS X on a G3.  This is  urlLink the column  I was reading that prompts this entry.  Before you click on the column to read the genius that is The Dave, click to this site:   urlLink artcritical.com .    Did you look at  "chair" ?  That's the title, you know.  chair.  They want an amazing amount of money for chair.  So much that one could go out and by a decent used car with it.  This is an example of "found art" which is to say, "trash".  One person's trash is another person's treasure, they say.  Or art.  Don't get me wrong; I love art.  A lot.  I really do.  I love the works of Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Breugel, Van Gogh, Mark Rothko, Rockwell, Kandinsky, Warhol, Rodin, O'Keefe, Picasso, J.M. Whistler, and a host of others.  I don't really "get" some of the stuff by Kandinsky or Picasso but I appreciate it.  I think that the reason I appreciate their work, as well as the works of hundreds of others, is that they have  created .  They've made something out of nothing and put effort into it.  Kandinsky's  urlLink abstractions  are a little out there but they have motion and contrast.  On the other side of the coin are the works of Mark Rothko, who's paintings are, at first glance, nearly monchromatic.  When you look more deeply into them though, you see subtle variations of shade which make for a  urlLink complex image .  I really do appreciate that.  But when a person finds a old busted up chair somewhere and sticks it in a corner and calls it "art", that's where my understanding and appreciation fails me.  I have friends who are artists.  Heather, for example.  Heather is a very talented artist.  I have a beautiful drawing of a goldfish she did which hangs proudly on my wall.  I look at it frequently, and appreciate it.  Heather also is a chandler -- a maker of candles -- who is dedicated to her craft.  She takes great pains at making sure her candles; indeed, everything she does, are made well and with care.  I don't think it would ever occur to her to find an old busted-up chair on someone's trash heap and put it in a corner and call it art.  I support the arts.  I understand that not every piece of art is called 'art' by all.  But the vast majority of people who create art do just that:  They create.  They make something out of nothing.  They don't make nothing out of nothing.  I'll close by sharing an idea I had a long time ago for a work of pseudo "performance art".  A large wire trash can, the kind you see made of wire mesh but on a much larger scale, would be placed in the middle of a dark room.  The can itself would be illuminated from above with a narrow-focus white spot.  As people came into the room they would be invited to grab at random from one of several boxes around the room a piece of colored paper.  They wouldn't be able to determine the color before they took it.  Then they would be invited to crumple the paper up or fold it or do whatever with it and toss it into the basket.  There would be a distance involved between the perimeter of the exhibit and the viewing/tossing area, so not every item would go into the basket.  Some would fall around the outside of it.  Many would go into it.  From there, the basket would fill with brightly colored paper, always changing as it filled.  Every so often, when it was overflowing, an image would be taken by a panoramic camera of the basket and the debris field around it.  Then the basket would be emptied and the floor swept and the process would start again.  Sure, it's wacky and odd but it is created art.  In fact, it's created by hundreds of people.  That's truly inspiring.  I need to sit down after this.  Anyone got chair?

       I was talking to a friend yesterday about the travails of life -- insurance, relationships, work, kids and family, money, etc.  We talked about how nice it would be to go back in time to be a kid again.   Arbitrarily, I decided that 11 years old would be a nearly perfect time to go back.  Two days as an eleven year old boy in late June of 1977; the year that I was eleven.  That's the other part of the requirement, to go back in time as well.  To be able to identify with being an eleven year old better.  For my friend Vicki, it would have been 1984.  Neither of us would have a clue how to live today if we suddenly became eleven, so it would be best to be in our own times.  So, there we were: Vicki as an 11 year old girl in 1984 and Bob as an 11 year old boy in 1977.  Late June.  School's out and there's nothing to do but enjoy life as it was meant to be enjoyed.  No worries about money or families or the state of the world.  At eleven years old you get upset that the news is on, since that means the cartoons aren't.  You live for  urlLink The Wonderful World of Disney  on Sunday nights and you bug your parents to go see  urlLink Star Wars  over and over.  Life, in hindsight, was truly good, at least for me.  I know that there are a lot of eleven year old kids -- both in 2004 and 1977 -- for whom life is, and was, not truly good.  They live in poverty and pain and I feel sadness and pity for them.  But this is my life and my 11 year old self doesn't really know about them in any great depth.  From there, I continued to refine this desire to retreat.  I asked Vicki which she would prefer to do:  Go back in time to her 11 year old self to live those two days with no knowledge of her 30 year old life but with full recall of the days' events.  In this way the experience would be pure and genuine.  She would be able to truly be a kid again and when she returned from her experience, those memories would be fresh in her mind and she would be able to keep them and treasure them for what they were.  Or, I asked, would she like to go back and be a 30 year old in the body of an 11 year old?  Where she would be able to look at her situation critically and do the things she really wanted to do?  If she wanted to play with little Susie Smith down the street, who was her bestest friend from kindergarten but who moved to California when they were 12 and she hasn't heard from her since then, she can do that.  There's no need to "take chances".  She can appreciate the events of the days first hand and mold her experience as she wanted to.  In order to simplify things I added the caveat that she wouldn't be able to change anything in her future, like telling her parents to "buy Microsoft".  She would live the days as she pleased and when she came back she would have those memories intact.  Vicki chose the first option.  She chose to look at the world through the genuine eyes of an 11 year old and take those experiences back with her.  That's totally valid and a good choice.  For me, it wasn't really that easy of a choice.  There certainly is the desire to have the pure and unadulterated memory fresh in my mind of eleven year old Bobby but there was an overwhelming desire to be able to go back and spend nearly every second of that time being my parents' son and my brother's brother again.  To bask in that feeling of warmth and happiness and security.  I suppose that it was a double edged sword, this idle exercise of "what if?".  Because it made me realize that I miss my family quite a lot, even now.  My brother Jim has been gone for 17 years now.  For dad it's been eight years and mom, six.  That's a long time to go and the memories, though still plentiful, begin to fade slowly, like a daguerreotype from the ninteenth century.  The contrasts have begun to even out and the shadows are lighter.  Would it be valuable to go back and be able to really burn those images in my mind?    Or am I unable to separate the 38 year old me far enough away that I could perform this exercise for what it is?  The conversation started out as a desire to escape from the issues of adulthood, yet I focus on them in my very desire to choose the most effective method of escaping it for a time.  It was an odd and almost funny realization when it happened.  But also sad in a way, that I have grown so far from the child that I once was and have always tried to stay close to on some level.  So, because I want to never retreat too far from eleven year old Bobby, I too will choose to leave the 38 year old me here in the present and go out and play for a couple of days.

       The visit on Friday to MSU went very well.  I met with the interim director of the ACS program,  urlLink David Stowe .  He's a very nice person and patiently answered all of my questions about the program.    One of the best things about the program is how wide-open it is.  There's only one required course in the entire track,  urlLink ACS 881 , and everything else is decided between you and your advisor.  In a nutshell, I have to start out at the Master's level, where I'll get an MA in ACS.  From there, I'll go on the the Ph.D.  The ACS Master is two tracks:  24 credit hours plus thesis or 30 credits without.  I'll be opting for the 30 credit track, if only because I don't want to get bogged down with a thesis that ends up taking much longer to write than a semester.  And the way I procrastinate, that would be the case.  Also, the 30 credits route requires that some of the credits be in  vocational designs involving management skills .  Historic preservation is specifically mentioned.  Even if they don't accept the credits I took (nearly 10 years ago now) at  urlLink Eastern  I can still do HP.  How cool is that?   From there, on to the Ph.D. program which is an additional 18 credits (I think...) plus dissertation.  About six years, once I start the ball rolling.  He was also happy to hear I've had experience teaching (Earth science, astronomy, physics) at the college level.  He said they haven't had a problem placing students in grad assistantships up to this point and if funding stays constant, I should be able to get one.  Rock.  I was walking on clouds the rest of the day.  It was also a really pretty day and the sun was out.  Sandy had to keep hold of my shoelaces to keep me from floating off.

       I applied online to MSU via the  urlLink Lifelong Education  program and got my acceptance letter yesterday.  It's really cool to have that to look forward to.  They allow you to take any course you want to without actually having to go through the hassle of applying to the Graduate School and take the GRE and do all that stuff that goes along with it.  In talking to Kathleen, the secretary of the  urlLink American Cultural Studies  program, I found that I can transfer these credits to the program when I finally get the application in and get accepted.  Of course, I can't take  all  of my classes this way; that would be way too easy.  But it's still easy to take them this way for as long as I can.  Now I have to decide when to apply to the school.  I could apply to the school now to get accepted for the 2005-06 year but I don't know if that would be more or less advantageous when I can take the classes through the Lifelong Education program.  I should probably take the  urlLink GRE  at the very least, so I know my score.  If I tank the test I can always take it later or wait.  Since I can take several LE classes and still apply them to the program requirements, there isn't as much pressure to get accepted.  But it would be good to have them out of the way and be able to concentrate on school.  I realized something recently.  My net take-home pay is about $36,000 per year.  Maybe a touch more but that's close enough for my purposes.  I can get graduate level student loans for up to $30,000 per year which are tax-free.  In other words, I could get big loan and live off of it while I went to school and have the luxury of being able to concentrate soley on school and not have to worry about a job, apart from maybe a part time one somewhere.  Hell, I could even get a 20 hour position here and keep my benefits and maybe end up making even more money than I do now.    I know that this money would have to be repaid eventually but it would enable me to get a Ph.D.  much  faster than I would get one by taking night classes only.  I'd be able to take several classes per semester, rather than the one or two I'd be able to take otherwise.  According to  urlLink salary.com  the median salary for an assistant professor (the lowest tenure-track position) nationally is $61,247.  Even the 25th percentile is still at $50,043, still more than I make now as a middle-level systems administrator.  For  urlLink Ann Arbor  specifically, the numbers are better:  $64,983 and $53,095 for median and 25th percentile, respectively.  If I were to get my Ph.D. in two or three years by going full-time instead of four to six years by going part time, I can be making more money faster which would in turn offset the costs of getting the loans.  I'm not making any rash decisions here, I'm simply laying out ideas to be pondered upon.

       It's been an interesting day.  First thing this morning, I got an email from a mostly anonymous reader of this page who noticed my diatribe on WAAM and the complaint about not being able to get hold of Ken Kelly, former afternoon drive jock for them.  He supplied me with Ken's email address, which was WAY cool so I popped Ken an email this morning.  I told him how much I missed his show and I was looking forward to his getting back on the air as soon as possible.  He said he's been interviewing at various places, so that's a good thing.  Ken's a rare person in today's radio:  He speaks his mind, but not in a Howard Stern way; more of a slightly cynical  urlLink Paul Harvey  way.  He's also quite intelligent and very funny.  These are obviously things which don't mesh well with today's canned radio stations who import everything from somewhere else.    If you ever want Ken's email address, email me and I'll let you know.  I think it's OK to give out, since he was giving it out on his last days on the air there.  But I don't want to put it here for worries that the spambots will cull it and start flooding his email with solicitations for V |/-\ G R /-\ and emails from  urlLink Nigeria  on behalf of Generallisimo Mombutu, late of the President's cabinet, who was assassinated in a mysterious car accident and left 85 million dollars in a Swiss account but with no way to get it out, unless Ken supplies them with his name, address, and bank account number.    Anyway, that was pretty cool.  I also was informed that I have to impliment a time tracking and  urlLink trouble ticketing system  here at work.  I understand why but I don't necessarily have to like it and the reasons behind it.    Damn blogspot doesn't have any way to make a post 'friends-only'.  Wish it did.  'Nuff said.

       It hasn't been as detailed as I'd hoped for but it's been very interesting.  To run down, the first week was great.  It really whet my appetite for future things to come.  The second week was, plainly put, a bust.  The lecturer was two-dimensional and boring and I found it difficult to even follow the lecture.  She sounded like -- indeed, was -- she was reading from a printed sheet.  This week's class, the third, on Death in New Orleans, was quite interesting.  One class left to go.  I decided that I'll wait to write about it until the classes end.  I had hoped to summarize each class, assuming that they were all going to be as information-heavy as the first one.  This wasn't the case but that's an OK thing.  I'll probably draw primarily from the first class when I write but touch on things learned from the other three.  The first class is what got the ball rolling, anyway.

       How stupid do they think we are?  WASHINGTON (AP) - The top U.S. military officer in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, will be replaced as part of a command restructuring that has been in the works for several months, administration officials said Tuesday. The Pentagon also suspended Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski from her command.   I'm sure it's all totally coincidental that the commanding general of the Middle Eastern Command would be replaced, unannounced, right when all the crapola is hitting the fan and the President's approval rating is in the toilet.  Newsflash:  Command restructures are rare and well-announced.  The higher you go, the rarer they are.  And they're always held with a lot of notification because there are issues that have to be addressed down the command chain.  When a general is relieved from command to go to a different post, there's always prior notice as to where he or she will be posted to:   "Brigadier General Sam Jones, commander of Fort Shilliwack for the last five years, will take over command of the 13th Mechanized Infantry Division, stationed in Öddlesbiddlebaddle, Germany.  General Jones' change of command ceremony will occur on  {a date that's three to six months in the future}  and he will assume his command of the 13th on  {above date plus two or three weeks} .  We wish him well at his new posting."    See how that works?  I could find NO information about General Sanchez' new posting, nor an announcement of his leaving.  Until today, that is.  There was some speculation in the past several weeks, since the news stories broke, but nothing about a command restructure.  Of course they'll say that the announcement wasn't made due to security precautions but isn't that getting to be a bit old to use for an excuse?  At least they actually did say they were suspending General Karpinski from her command.  Ultimately, it boils down to this:  General Karpinski's career is over.  She has a big giant neon black check mark next to her name which will ensure that she's passed over for promotion and future "cushy" commands.  General Sanchez, being a Lt. General (three stars, vs. General Karpinski's one) will be allowed to step down to some Pentagon duty where he'll be on all sorts of exciting panels and committees for the rest of his career until his imminent retirement.

       Saturday started out as one of those average weekend days for me.  I got up around 10 am and wondered if I should go back to bed since there wasn't much to do until later that afternoon, when Jen came over.  There was a  urlLink decent auction  going on near the 'ol homestead and I, being the auction nut that I am, decided that would be worth going to.  Of course I was also noticing that my back was aching at a higher level than it usually does but I was not going to let a little case of "90 year-old man-itis" stop me from collecting more junk.  So I went over and hobbled around and did my auction thing, which was to add to my junk.    I got a couple of good items, though.  There was a  urlLink kerosene heater  that looked almost new for $5; a hoover vacuum for $5; three coolers, one of which is a metal Coleman for $6; and two old-fashioned scythes (for a friend of Sandy's who wants to put them in her garden) for $17; and a sleeping bag, the old fashioned canvas kind, for $1.  I was in the bidding for a Ranger pickup until it hit $1000.  It finally went for $1300 which was a pretty good deal.  It was a '91 but it looked to be in great shape.  Would have been a nice spare vehicle.  So, anyhow, I got out of there for about $35  And everything I got (except the scythes, which I'm not keeping) is usable.  I consider that a good auction experience.  Plus,  urlLink Braun and Helmer  just are fun to go see in action.  When I was little my dad used to take me to auctions and theirs were the ones I loved to go to most because Jerry Helmer is a stitch.  So after the auction I went home and unloaded my stuff and got my book ( urlLink  Ordinary Men   -- review is coming up) and went to have some Chinese at the buffet next door.  I try to make this my Saturday habit.  I get up at 9 or 10, then shower and relax a little, then go over to the buffet with my book and eat and read for an hour or two.  I enjoy just sitting there snacking and reading and drinking nice warm tea for a while.  Some of the waitstaff seem to recognize me now, as they seat me in a booth and bring me the tea without asking.  Makes a guy feel special.   Cheers  in a Chinese buffet setting.  Kind of.   After such a rigorous day I felt I needed a nap.  It was three in the afternoon, after all, and I'd been up for nearly five hours.  I couldn't be expected to function with this kind of stress.  So I set the alarm for 4:00 and figured I'd have time to get up and start functioning before Jen got there.  Except I wasn't planning on hitting the snooze button continuously until 4:40 when she did arrive.  Jen took it in stride; she's seen my underwear before, as I've answered the door when she comes down in it before.  It ain't sexual or anything, I wear boxer briefs and they're about as revealing as a swimsuit.  Besides... it's Jen, for God's sake.  She's resisted my manly wiles for these many years already.  Boxer briefs aren't gonna get me any further.  But I digress.  I worked on her computer some, which wasn't going on at all.  She'd been having this problem since a power outage at her parents' place a couple of weeks ago. I figured it was either the memory or the motherboard.  When I looked further into it, I realized I didn't have the same memory as the system took, so I needed her to call Dell on it. She did and they thought it was the memory, too, after having her do a couple of things like taking the video card out and such.  Long story short, she got new memory and now is humming right along.  Hopefully she'll get the surge protector I've been after her to get for more than a year now.  Then I lost my pants at poker.  Good thing I was wearing the boxer briefs.  Well, not literally "lost my pants".  Rather, I didn't do well.  It was Heather's birthday and we all went over to Kim's place and had dinner then settled in for a friendly game of  urlLink Texas Hold-'em .  Which is where the pantsing began.  To be perfectly honest, I had crap the entire night.  Twice I had a pair in-hand.  Beyond that, it was usually seven-four off suit or something equally crappy.  But Jen seemed to get the hang of it, in spite of having to consult the cheat sheet outlining the ranks of the hands.  She really cleaned up, taking home pure profit.  Of course, since I provided her buy-in money, she'd been running on pure profit since the first hand.  It broke up around 1am, by which time I was on my third Jameson's and Coke, breaking my promise to myself to keep it to one plus beers.  Three J&Cs and one beer.  It should have been the reverse -- maybe I'd have done better.  Not that I would have.  The very mild inebriation I was experiencing wouldn't have prevented me from seeing the crap that was on the table, card-wise.  Sunday was spent doing nothing but relaxing and getting gas for the car.  I decided to take a drive around and relax.  Sandy came back from Ohio early and decided to tag along.  We stopped for dinner at  urlLink Hometown Buffet , formerly the Old Country Buffet, and had a very filling dinner.  Two people can eat well for $20.  Not a bad deal.  After dinner began  The Great Search for Gas Below $2.00 per Gallon .  Not quite as easy as you might think.  We drove about fourty miles to find gas under this "magical" price.  Given that the national average for a gallon of gas went past $2 today, I'm happy I managed to find it.  Three places were at $1.999 per gallon, all on Michigan Avenue.  I stopped at a Citgo at Michigan in the Inkster area.  I don't remember the cross-street but it doesn't matter as I'd bet they're up above $2 per gallon now.  Gas prices seem to be rising nearly daily now as opposed to weekly like they were a few months ago.  Sandy managed to get it for $1.939 in Ohio on her way home.  Yes, I realize fully I burned far more in gas than I saved by looking for cheap gas.  But I did it for other reasons:  the thrill of the hunt, for one.  I like to find the cheapest gas around.  It gives me a sense of accomplishment.  For another, I wanted to drive out to St. Hedwig's Cemetery over near Telegraph, between Ford Rd. and Joy.  It's a cool cemetery on the Joy Rd. side with lots of sculpture and such and I want to photograph it, maybe next week.  Also, it was just a really nice afternoon and evening and it was a good night for a drive.  Sunny, cool, and the traffic was light.  Yeah, so I spent a few dollars' worth of gas.  It beat just sitting home alone in my boxer briefs, mourning the loss of my pants.

       Remember when I said I was going to write about the books I'd read?  I wrote my review of  The Devil in the White City  in a  urlLink February entry .  It isn't like I've been slacking since then.  I started reading Stephen Ambrose's  urlLink  Nothing Like it in the World   which was the story of the building of the transcontinental railroad.  This was a book that was out of both mine at Dr. Ambrose's usual realm.  We're both military historians who specialize in World War II.  (Except he did the writing and I did the reading)  This book was an exercise in taking a break from writing about World War II for him.  By his own admission, he wasn't used to writing without being able to interview the people who took part in what he was writing about.  The transcontinental railroad was finished in 1869 so there aren't going to be very many people available for interviews.  As a result there is less narrative-via-storytelling in this book.  Ambrose relies on a narrative drawn from copious records stored in the archives of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads.  There are many of them:  telegrams, letters to family and businessmen, cargo and shipping manifests, etc.  But these aren't really recollections as much as they are lists and facts.  With the exception of the personal letters to family, there are few diaries to draw information from.  And it's a one-way street.  You can't ask a letter home to expand on a comment made in passing.  What was of little immediate importance in 1867 may be crucial to a larger puzzle in the 1990s when he was doing research for the book.  It wasn't an easy read for me because I'm not as familiar with the background material.  When I'm reading about D-Day, I already know about the larger picture; I've read dozens of books about the war in Europe and I'm aware of how the planning occurred and how it related to the war in general.  But with this story, I had embarrassingly little prior knowledge so I found myself having to go back and reread passages to understand them better and to go to other sources to allow me to put these events in context.  It was more like studying for an exam than it was reading for pleasure.  It was still fun.  I know a LOT more about the labor history of the middle ninteenth century now and I know a lot more about the people from that time.  Up to this point, my knowledge was limited in scope to the Civil War and a little bit of side reading about the broad cultural aspects of the period.  This book was widely criticized as being too one-sided and Ambrose was accused of plagarizing large passages of it.  Someone of his stature and reputation cannot plagarize.  His books are used as references for dozens of other books and any plagarism is going to be found quickly.  In this case, I think there were probably examples of the same ideas found in other books being stated similarly.  After all, there are only so many ways to convey an idea well.  Sure, he could have quoted over and over, just to make sure but then the book becomes a string of quotations sewn together to make a new book.  So I'm not at all behind the idea of his being a plagarizer.  He was just too good an historian to do that.  I did enjoy this book but I don't know that I'd be able to get into this same period of history, at least this topic of this period of history, enough that I could fill in background myself.  It's a really interesting era, no doubt about that, but it doesn't captivate me the same ways that other topics and historical eras do.

       So, thanks to  urlLink Heather  I found out about a seminar seeries being offered at the  urlLink U of M, Dearborn  titled "Graveyards 101".  Heather, knowing me as she does, knew that I would love to go to this lecture series.  Of course, she was right.  There are four lectures over the course of the next four Wednesdays.   They'll be titled:  May 12th "Death and Dying in Pre-Modern Europe"  May 19th "Death in Vienna"  May 26th "The New Orleans Way of Death"  June 2nd "Images of Death in Comparative Perspective"   There are several texts used in the course, today's concentrated on a book written by Philippe Aries,  urlLink  The Hour of Our Death    Aries was not a historian in the trained sense.  He was a lover of history.  After his day job, he would go home and research and read history.  This is one of his best books.  I've read parts of it before, but I'm going to order it and read it cover to cover now.  I've decided that I'll discuss the topic each class covers here.  My thoughts and the ideas presented in class.  I have to say that I came out of this class awhirl with ideas and concepts that I hadn't really been able to gel together before.  I'll be interested to see where I go with them.    More later.

       I'd fully intended to plug away at a new entry, one of depth and substance but that was before I decided to "tweak" the look of the blog in general.  That created a "fix one thing, break two more" loop that lasted for quite a while.  But finally it seems to be fixed, I managed to keep everything and I got a template that I more or less like.    I wanted one that had the sidebar stuff on the left with the journal entries on the right but it looked messed up in IE every time, no matter what I did.  It always looked OK in Netscape though.  But I'm all about consistency across platforms, so I had to scrap that idea.  It looks OK -- for now.  I've also enabled comments, so feel free.

        It started out innocently enough.  I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up.  Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.  I began to think alone - "to relax," I told myself.  But I knew it wasn't true.  Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.  I began to think on the job.  I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.  I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka.  I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, "What is it exactly we are doing here?"  Things weren't going so great at home either.  One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life.  She spent that night at her mother's.  I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker.  One day the boss called me in.  He said, "I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem.  If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job."  This gave me a lot to think about.  I came home early after my conversation with the boss.  "Honey," I confessed, "I've been thinking..."  "I know you've been thinking," she said, "and I want a divorce!"  "But Honey, surely it's not that serious."  "It is serious," she said, lower lip aquiver.  "You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!"  "That's a faulty syllogism," I said impatiently, and she began to cry.  I'd had enough.  "I'm going to the library," I snarled as I stomped out the door.  I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with NPR on the radio.  I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open.  The library was closed.  To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night.  As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye.  "Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?" it asked.  You probably recognise that line.  It comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.  Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker.  I never miss a TA meeting.  At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was  Porky's .  Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.  I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home.    Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.  Soon, I will be able to vote Republican.

       I dream, everyone does.  I don't frequently remember what I was dreaming, excepting in random and very foggy memory fragments.  But this morning I had a dream that I actually remember in some detail:  I was a member of a scientific team who were responsible for the development and launch of a probe to examine some sort of small object in space.  I don't really remember what, specifically, but it wasn't huge.  It seems like it was an asteroid or a comet.    Anyway, the probe we were designing was very cool.  It was a sphere at launch but once in space it broke into four wedges, like a quartered orange.  Each wedge was responsible for different scientific measurements and had antennae and solar panels which deployed when it split up.  It also had a very sophisticated thruster system, in that it was capable of countering external effects of Newton's  urlLink Third Law .  It was capable of precise movement in a single dimension and remain stable in the other two.  There was even computer-modelled imagery in my dream, showing NASA-like  urlLink simulations  of the probe's mission.    The funny thing was that part of the testing involved running piping and wiring through the interior of a  urlLink 1961 Lincoln Continental .  For some reason, this car had to be used for the experiment because if the  urlLink suicide doors .  Anyway, we had to move through the lab testing area by crawling through the car's interior.  Unfortunately, I woke up at this time and never got to see the undoubted success of our awesome probe, developed with the assistance of the  urlLink Lincoln-Mercury Corporation .    I blame this dream on influence from a dream from another friend of mine who shall remain nameless but not blameless, and is known for his up-fucked imagery.

       There are days when I hate having to sit behind my desk working on some project that needs to be done the day before yesterday.  Today is not one of those days.  I ran across a web site that is not only funny, it's downright hilarious.  It's a site that one Diana Goodman started up and it deals with people who are nearly insane.  Or at least they appear to be so, judging from some of the crackheaded names they want to "give" their children.  Diana makes poignant comments (read  "bitingly sarcastic" ) about many of these postings, which almost all come from a baby name site.  She mentions the site in her pages but I couldn't find it.  Doesn't really matter so much, as the sentiment seems universal, judging from the responses garnered through the 15+ pages.  Diana's site is here:   urlLink Not Without My Handbag .  Diana, if you ever read my humble blog, please tell me where you came up with your dotcom name.  Actually, that begs another site with dotcom names in a similar vein.  But this post is about Diana's site and I invite you to read a couple of excerpts that made me spit laugh, they were so funny (The part in regular text is the entry on the baby name web site, the italics are her response):   What is a nature realated name for a boy? I am pregnant with a boy and I already have four girls. My girls are Summer Skies, Autumn Night, April Shower, and Spring Flower. Please help I am due in November.  Star Light    Star Light, star bright, first star I see tonight. I wish I may, I wish I might, let this lady be a mental patient whose "children" are actually straws she stole from the hospital cafeteria.     My favorite name are: Xev Chiana Louise Nikita Gia Ravin  Gavin Charles Bailey  Tristan Michael Ares I want kids to entire the world unique.  When they turn 18 can always change it. I hate name like Collette. She would get picked on. Kids are not always PG!    Yeah, well I like names not stupid. Names actual exist. Pronoun, verb like too. Names suggest cruel, unusual. Fourth Amendment Constitution ban 'Nikita' for all but French assassins, bald Russian men. Friend, good! Fire, BAD!   (Helpful reader and SciFi channel viewer Joan adds that Xev is a character from Lexx: "She's a virgin love slave, in love with an animate dead assasin." and Chiana is from Farscape: an "escaped convict, genetically altered by her home planets government to be a nymphomaniac" and spread an STD across the universe. What does this say about Mama's ambitions for wee baby Xev Chiana? Do we really want to know?)    The disclaimer is that I don't hate all of the names that are mentioned here.  My own beautiful neice's name is McKenzie, a name which is bandied about frequently on these pages.  But many (most) of the names are, indeed, a little (lot) odd (freakish).  Go to Diana's site.  Read.  Laugh.  Appreciate.  Learn.  Mock.

       Ouch.  Sunburned neck.  I always think about putting on sunscreen; I realize the dangers of  urlLink skin cancer .  My dad had skin cancers on his neck and hands which were, fortunately, treatable.  But in the time when he was exposed to the sun continuously, people didn't wear sunscreens.  Plus, he was fighting a war in sunny  urlLink North Africa and Italy  and didn't really have much time to think about slathering on some SPF.  But I do resolve to be more active about putting some on rather than just thinking about it.  Keeping some in the car might be a good idea.  Duh.  I love auctions.  I'm almost addicted to them.  My favoritest of auction companies is  urlLink Braun and Helmer .  Dad took me to them when I was very young and I thought that it was like a toyland of "stuff".  Dad also taught me to wait for a good bargain all the time.  So auctions seem to be a sort of  raison d'etre  for me to find a good bargain.  Saturday I got a 32" Quasar TV for $110 and Sunday I got a garden tractor with a drag, mower deck, and front blade for $150.  It's an older tractor, a Sears model, and it's been pretty well maintained.  I went to the auction on Saturday with an idea towards getting one of those cool zero-radius-turn mowers but it went for $4000.  There was a Ford 1910 (model #, not year) tractor that went for more than $7000.  I'm convinced that I should be going into the tractor restoration business.  There was even an old  urlLink Farmall Cub  tractor in really rough condition that ended up going for $1800. (The picture is a different tractor)  In contrast, the auction yesterday had a beautiful  urlLink 1972 Lincoln Continental  with 57,000 original miles that only ended up going for $3250.  When we went back to pick up the tractor, I found out that they pulled the car from the auction with the view that it was really worth more than that.  I agree with that but it means that the seller has to start over again and start marketing it.  I don't think he was totally happy about that but he didn't find out until the end of the auction.    I think that one of the reasons I like auctions so much, other than to find way cool deals, is to sort of get a piece of the history of other people.  I find myself wanting to be the caretaker of the things that people no longer want yet someone liked well enough to buy or make.  There are items that we think are ugly today yet were considered high-fashion in their time.  And we feel connections with the mundane.  The guy who owned this tractor hadn't used it regularly for several years, as he'd bought a newer and bigger one.  Yet, when it was wheeled out for the auction, his daughter was upset that he was getting rid of it, saying that she'd grown up with it.  As an aside (aren't all of my blog entries asides, really?), I was upset with my sister for giving away the old Allis Chalmers tractor that I grew up with.  It's the first thing I ever drove, the sound lulled me to sleep on many summer nights as my dad would mow into the darkness, it's a part of my childhood.  Never mind that it was ancient, it was ours.  It was mine.  There are little knicknacks that are parts of our lives which are part of the "background noise".  Things that are in our world for our entire lives and when they go away we feel their absence.  A particular piece of furniture; an old table lamp; even the way a room is arranged.  We get used to them and they become part of that noise.  When they change, so changes the noise.  It's different -- not quite right.  It's a little out of tune.  I guess that when I buy that little knicknack, I try to bring a sense of harmony into my own life and allow those who grow up with something and wonder what's happen to it to imagine that it's gone to a good home.

       I know I haven't blogged in more than forever but I have a really good excuse!!  Yeah, I do... Ummm... My dog ate it.  I dropped it in the mud and couldn't read it.  No, really!  No, really.  I've been up to my shiny metal ass in work which has allowed me precious little free time to expound on life's humor.  I'm taking a few minutes now while I run some utilities on another computer.  Were it not for this need, precipitated by interesting and strange random freeze ups, I'd be back nose to the grindstone.  Today's problem centers around getting this silly ticketing system to work.  I have XP installed, patched, and firewalled; ASPemail installed but not tested; IIS installed and tested; and the Liberum Help Desk installed.  That's the biggie right now:  I can't get the stupid software to run.  It's basically just .asp scripts which feed into an Access database.  The problem is that I can't get to the helpdesk itself which is accessible via a web interface.  It keeps telling me that it can't view XML input using XSL style sheets.  Gah.    After it finishes, I'm going back in.  Wish me luck.  BTW:  Here's the message I'm getting, in case someone reads this who understands more than I:  The XML page cannot be displayed.  Cannot view XML input using XSL style sheet.  Please correct the error and then click the Refresh button, or try again later.  A name was started with an invalid character.

In order to update your account information, you need to complete the following !&nbsp; If not, your account may Be CLOSED and errors may occur without notification If you have gotten this before you Must of failed to complete ALL FEILDS!&nbsp;   Stunning, isn't it?&nbsp;   But it's what information they ask you for that's the ballsy part:   User ID  Password  Account type Seller Buyer  First Name  M.I.  Last Name  email  email password  address  city  state  phone  zip code  Card Number  Expiration Date  social Security Number  Atm Pin  Date Of Birth  Mothers Maiden Name  Drivers lisence number  Bank Account#  Routing #  Wow.&nbsp; They sure do want to make sure you are who you say you are.&nbsp; I'm sure that when they send this out again, with improvements, they'll also ask for a DNA sample and fingerprints.  Well, I filled it out just for fun.&nbsp; Stuff like George&nbsp;W. Bush, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington D.C.,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; Shucks.&nbsp; The email&nbsp;account is shut off.&nbsp; I wonder&nbsp;if that means eBay is having a problem with their email servers?&nbsp; The email return address,&nbsp;  urlLink something3434 @ yahoo.com  is unknown to the intermediate mail gateway now, so I'm sure it's been shut off.  I'll tell ya.&nbsp; Kids these days.&nbsp; If they put as much effort into video games as they did hacking, we'd be up to Final Fantasy XX now, instead of just X.&nbsp; They still wouldn't be able to read or write but they'd be off the internet and on the video game consoles.

        "I could do it. I'm a really good camper. I can sleep on the ground. There are many, many good people who have gone to prison. Look at Nelson Mandela"  --Martha Stewart, in an ABC News interview, saying she could handle prison.      &nbsp; See, now that's funny.&nbsp; Marvelous Martha has no clue what's coming down the pike for her.&nbsp; She's going into a work camp and thinks it's summer camp.&nbsp; I'm sure that the class of criminal she will be incarcerated alongside will be something less than serial killer-level but there's still going to be a struggle for power, just like there is in every enclosed environment.&nbsp; Humans are pack animals, with hierarchical structure.&nbsp; We're more sophisticated than wolves, in that we plot and plan and backstab our way to the top.&nbsp; Wolves just fight.&nbsp; Strongest wins.&nbsp; Maybe they're the sophisticated ones. &nbsp; Anway, Martha's in for a whole lot of "fun" if she thinks it's gonna be a camping adventure.&nbsp;

       http://snipurl.com/7n0d  "This whole thing was inadvertent. It happened a long time ago at a files storage site in Denver," a senior defense official, who asked not to be identified, said.   How convenient.  The things that happen to this administration just continue to amaze and stun me.    "We're only missing those files which are guaranteed to clear (or convict) the President.  Shucks and darn.  Sorry about that; that pesky film just crumbled."

       Ganked from Eric's blog:    You are a WRDF--Wacky Rational Destructive Follower. This makes you a hacker. Your thirst for knowledge can be damaging to your possessions--you like to take things apart, even if you then forget to put them back together. You demand respect and, no matter how much you are respected, seldom feel it is adequate. You are tenacious, and will stick to a task long after weaker minds have given it up.   Socially, you are awkward, and get into arguments and make people uncomfortable. One recommends counting to ten, holding back comments unless warranted, and listening more than speaking. Still, your no-holds-barred approach to socialization can be strangely endearing, as long as you are funny and self-deprecating.  You feel misunderstood, and you probably are.

       So I'm pondering about converting from Blogger over to LiveJournal.  It isn't an absolute done deal or anything but it's something that I'm thinking about more and more.  There's much more granularity with LJ than there is with Blogger and that's what really appeals to me.  I mean, I don't mind sharing with people; that's what I started the silly thing for in the first place.  But sometimes issues crop up in my life that I'm not ready to tell the world in general about but maybe my local group of friends should know.  Blogger just doesn't easily allow for that.  The thing that keeps me here is the very lengthy history of blog that I've created already.  I was looking for some sort of conversion utility but that doesn't seem to exist.  So I choose now between: 1) Sticking with Blogger and dealing with the lack of granularity for posts.  2) Converting posts already made over by hand, one at a time, into LJ.  3) Just leaving Blogger here with a pointer to my new LJ home.  Choice #2 seems like the only reasonable long-term answer at this point.  Choice #1 is probably the least likely unless Blogger announces some amazing new changes.  When they were bought out by the Google behemoth I thought this might occur.  It has not.  The third choice is really not feasible because Blogger deletes blogs which haven't been updated in some predetermined time period.  And I don't want that.  So, for now, I will continue to research.  But in the long term, look for my new home over on LJ, which has existed for some time already but only has  urlLink one entry .    Comments are welcome.

       Said this:  Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.    When I first read it, I didn't believe it.  But in doing some research as to the authenticity of it, I ran across previous verification of it from snopes.  If it's at snopes, it's true.  I know them only by reputation and I do know from personal experience that they confirm what they say.  The link to the verification is  urlLink here .  I confess that when I read this I was surprised at how well it fits current events.  I didn't think that Goering really had said this but it sounded like a quote that might be tracked down with some digging.  When I saw that it had, indeed been said by him, I got a cold chill.  Vote.  Please.  Follow your conscience, read the words above over and over, and follow your conscience.
