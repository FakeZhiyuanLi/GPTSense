      Greetings Shapely Tankers!  I have made absolutely no progress on my Shapely T. As I mentioned in my April 19 post below, I have to rip back to the short row section because I started the waist decreases too soon. For me to rip back requires total and complete concentration. However, I haven't found the time to devote my full and undivided attention to this task. Waah!  I'm leaving on a 11 day trip to Nicaragua tomorrow and I still haven't decided if Shapely T will be my traveling project. Come to think of it, I would get 7 hours of pure knitting time on the plane - hum... well that is if Airport Security will let me on with my knitting weapons, oh I mean, needles.  Other than a Bon Voyage post, I won't be posting here or on my  urlLink knitting blog  until I return. However, I have set up a travel blog where I am chronicling my journey to Nicaragua and back. You can find it  urlLink here  if you're interested. Shameless plug - I know.  I look forward to seeing everybody's progress when I return!  Ciao!

      I'm stalled with the back being done yet. I got sidetracked with making a tank top for one of my SIL's birthday on May 3rd (? I think). We'll be celebrating it on Mother's Day. I'm doing a variation of  urlLink Knitty's Sigma  for her. I added waistline shaping using the Shapely Tank pattern as a guideline and I'm doing striping using the Fibonacci sequence so I'm calling it Sequential Sigma. It's really flying (of course it helps that her total circumfrence of the tank in this gauge is only ~30 sts more than 1/2 of my shapely tank, LOL). I've split it at the armholes and have just a few more rows before I start the neck shaping on the back and then I have the front to do, attach the straps and then edge the armholes and neck with a round of single crochet. There are pics at  urlLink my blog . I hope to be back on track with my Shapely no later than the end of next week, but I'm hoping for Wednesday...

      I've decided that I will definitely wait until I take my finishing class (May 22nd) before I seam up my Shapely. I really want to do a good job finishing this piece. It won't be forgiving like my bulky worsted weight sweaters. I can't hide all kinds of boo boos. I will have to be satisfied watching all of your projects moving along. How's everyone doing?

      Hi everyone! I finally finished the back. Why the back first? I think I really messed up on the short rows, so figured the back wouldn't be as noticable as the front hehehe. If you want to check out a pic of the back it is here http://blog.textbox.net/cathy/.  I'm interested in hearing what types of yarn everyone used.

      Hello everyone!  I'm  urlLink Kellye  and I'm thrilled to be knitting-along.  I've just totally and completely figured out short rows this weekend for the first time ever, thanks to the Shapely Tank and Bonne Marie's tutorial.  Ahhhh.  I ran around the house (like a three year old snorting Kool-aid) showing it to everyone.  Even the cats.   Finally, my basket of horribly deformed half-knit socks will be avenged!  I'm halfway through the 14 rows of plain stockinette between the increases and decreases and hope to have pictures soon!  Oh, p.s. I also had some problems with my guage...normally a tight knitter, I swatched with 7's and came up with 6 sts and 7 rows per inch?  Can that be right?  I guess we'll see!

      Here is my "in progress: shot. This is the front and I am just about to start the short row shaping for the bust.   urlLink    The yarn is more purple that the photo shows. Bad lighting. Instead of 13 inches to the bust, I have done 12 to fit my short-waist.   The bottom garter stitch band is rolling badly. Hope blocking will cure that. Anybody found that it doesn't???

      Lay it out flat and measure the whole width.  If that is close to what the pattern suggests, or your belly, then keep going.  My gauge was off - then I changed stitch quantity and I think I regret it.

      Hi all. Having fun reading your comments. I'm not making a lot of progress, maybe 6 inches so far, but then I'm used to slow progress. I've decided not to do the waist dec/inc, since I mostly don't have a waist any more. Anyone else doing this? I suppose that makes it my 'Not-so-Shapely-Tank(orTee)', but I have to face reality. And now I have a problem. I got my guage with a size 7 (I really, really did knit a swatch), but checked the guage again last night & found I now have one stitch too many. WTF? I'm certainly not going up to an 8, the fabric is loose enough already using a 7. I think it's the cotton. Do you foresee a huge problem if I keep on the way I'm going? I don't want to be a masochist and finish it to find it's way too big, but then I also hate to have to start over. H-E-L-P.

      I am not too happy with my alterations to the pattern but I'm refusing to frog it - Kermit protests.  So I am going to deal with what I get - I don't want to stitch a border around the inside neck, but due to the funny cast off per row - I will have to pick-up stitches around the arms.  That detail will also cover my bra strap.  I tried it on (carefully) and it's a little snug (personal problem)- but not bad, since it stretches nicely.  I am anxious to get this done.

      oh oh!  I ALSO thought it said 11.5 inches!! I am decreasing at the 12"  mark!    I think I better stop that - I will have a not so shapely tank. There is NO way I am frogging this.  I bet it's time for the booby short rows then...

      Hi - I have just joined you all. I am  urlLink Jackie .  Started my "shapeply tank" this afternoon.  I have only just finished the bottom shaping.  But my mind tells me that I too read to knit 11 1/2 inches. I must go and re-read the pattern. Odd that I read it that way too though.  I will try to get a photo of my work so far. I am using a purple variegated cotton yarn. It looks pretty and the yarn is knitting up a dream.

      Oh Marie, I know just how you feel. Except I made a really silly mistake. I thought it said to knit 11 1/2 inches. So after I knit that whole thing (took about a week) I realized that it was only supposed to be 1 1/2 inches. *smacks forehead*  At least you didn't get too far.  Diana: I ove Kermit. I mean I really, really love Kermit. My room when I was ten was Kermit sheets, Kermit curtains, Kermit on the bed, Kermit towel. My husband kind of reminds me of Kermit. But then that makes me Miss Piggy.

      Hello all my Shapely Tank-ers!   I'm going to have to join Kermit in a trip to the frog pond! Boo Hoo.   I started my waist decreases too soon. Silly me, I didn't read the pattern correctly. After completing the short row section for the curved edge, the pattern says, "Work evenly for 1 1/2 inches then begin side decreases." I measured 1 1/2" from the beginning of the stockinette and not 1 1/2 from the end of the short row shaping. I know, I made a very simple mole hill into a mountain by not being using common sense. You'd a thought I would have gotten a clue when I had already knitted more than 1 1/2" by the end of the short row section.  Anyway, long story short, and ramblings aside, I'm going to have to frog back taking out the two decreases I've already made and knit to 1 1/2" above the short row section AND THEN START my waist decreases.

      Hey Marie, I love the yarn! I went to the ebay site you bought it from and drooled for awhile. I'll keep thinking on that yarn for awhile...  I actually had to go up a needle size to get gauge which was pretty weird for me, so I know what you mean. Now that I've knitted the front and I'm close to half way on the back, however, I think I should have stuck w/the size 6 needle regardless of what the gauge swatch said. Hmm, duh, I should check gauge on the back now and see where it is.   Also, loved you "Marilyn" (is that right? it was about 8 hours ago I checked out your blog and saw the photo...) Nice Job Gal!

      After joining the Knit-along several weeks ago, I now have something to blog about. I finally broke ground on my Shapely T!  I still haven't decided if I will knit the  urlLink Shapely Tank.jpg  or the  urlLink Shapely Tee.jpg . Fortunately, I have miles of stocking stitch and short rows before I have to make up my mind.  Here is my Shapely Swatch. I am knitting it out of some absolutely gorgeous handpainted  urlLink Egyptian Cashmere Cotton in the Petunias colorway  from the  urlLink Textile Design Art ebay store .     Ok, now I'm confused. I really freaked out when I saw the size needle required for the Shapely Tee/Tank was a size 6. Following my usual modus operandi, I would go down two needle sizes (size 4's! No, say it's not true!). But as fate would have it, I didn't have any needles smaller than a 6. However, I was so anxious to see this lovely yarn worked up, that I swatched with the 6's anyway. And wouldn't you know it - I was spot on gauge. What the...?  Maybe some of you veteran knitters can enlighten me. Do you think that cotton yarn would make such a difference to my knitting gauge? Or knitting with small (for me) needles would make a difference?  So now I have the  urlLink pattern  in one hand and  urlLink Bonne Marie's short row tutorial  in the other and I'm going to tackle short rows - Woo Hoo!  ~~~  Some of you may have noticed I copied my Shapely T verbiage directly from my own blog,  urlLink knitti-me , but you know what they say about reinventing the wheel and all that.  Anyway, in my comments regarding the needle size/gauge issue, I liked  urlLink Red Silvia's  comment, "...that it was just meant to be..." No asking the yarn gods why or wherefore...just shut up and keep knitting!!

      I gifted myself for my birthday yesterday by finishing the back of my tank! Wheee! I have a pic over on my blog, but you all just saw it a couple days ago so I'll spare ya...  I'm using Bernat CottonTots in Grape Berry and had to go up to sz 7 needles to get gauge.  Theresa - your tank look great!  I'm afraid I'm going to be at least somewhat side tracked before I make much progress on the front of my shapely, as I'm making a tank for my SIL2 for her birthday and we celebrate on Mother's Day. So, I now need to get going on that...

      Hey all,  I working with Brown Sheep Cotton Fleece in Mulberry. I've never worked with it before and it's a little slippery on my bamboo needles. I started with and am still working on the front. I got up to the armholes yesterday and need to work on it some more because they're not a smooth line. I may have to rip it out and try again. I'll post a picture in a few days once I can find and charge my digital camera. Next time, I definitely want to try it in the round; less finishing work to do!

      Hi all, I've just joined. I started my Shapely Tee in Sonata cotton (from Elann of course) in color Oceania. I'm loving the blues and purple. I'm about 3 inches into the front, but I'm going to use it as the back, because I'm not loving the way the short rows look. They kind of bend over, instead of flowing. It must be a feature of this particular cotton, as I've done them in wool and haven't seen this effect. I don't have a digital camera, or I'd show you what I mean. But I love the cotton texture, and I'm hoping I'm able to finish it to wear this season!

      Hi everyone!   I am probably 4-5 inches up the back. Wishing I had done the back first as so many of you did...oh well! Wondering now if I really do have enough yarn to make the sleeves for a Shapely Tee or not. Oh well! Got more "Silky Wool" in a nice cream color for the next Shapely, and I'm pleased to say I think I can make the next size smaller... woo hoo!   I am thinking this first one will tell me a lot about how I want to do the next one...but definitely wanting to make the in the round version, and possibly actually use the side shaping next time.   Very interested in what kind of yarn others are using for this...please tell!  Lisa in Oregon

      Kristi--Your tank looks great. It's nice to see your progress. Diana--I can't wait to see what you come up with. Sounds cool. Sonja--Have any pictures we can see? Theresa--Thanks once again for sharing your instructions on knitting the tank in the round. I will be using this information for future projects. Cathy--Did you finish your back? Lisa--How's it going?  I still haven't decided if I will finish my tank or wait until I do my finishing class. The class isn't until May which seems really far off. I think I will probably give in and finish the tank in the next week or so. Keep posting! I love to see and hear about your progress.

         I had a knitting tea at my LYS today and I'm almost done with the armhole shaping! I'm down under 100 sts per row now - yeah! This is going to be my back panel, but I saw the back of a completed one the other day in a  urlLink LiveJournal post  and would like my back to go up higher. So, I'm needing to take a closer look at the neck shaping and see if I can just add say 3 - 3.5 inches between the armhole shaping and the begining the the neck shaping instead of the 2 called for in the pattern.  Has anyone done that, or have more experience and can let me know if that is a bad idea?

      I am going to rip out my start and re-do it in the round and have no short rows at the bottom.  AND I'm going to make it look just like a tank I already have that has a full back and a low cut v-front. It will look very different.  But I think I will be happier. Maybe by the time it's done, I can call the pattern mine :-)

      Shapely Tank in the Round :   Cast on twice the number given for casting on for the front, minus 4 for the stitches that would have disappeared if you were seaming. In other words, 188 sts (96 x 2 = 192 - 4 = 188) for the size 38.  Place markers after the first half of the cast on stitches to indicate the sides (on the size 38 that would be after 94 sts) as this becomes important during the short rows, then for separating at the underarms. Now knit the garter stitch border by *purl 1 round then knit 1 round* until there are 3 garter stitch ridges.   For the short rows, just pretend the stitches between the markers on one side are the front and follow the directions. After the last short row turn, work back over the stitches, picking up and knitting the wraps with the stitch next to them as you came to them. After that, work on past the side marker and repeat the short row directions for the other side, it now being the back. Then knit all the way around one time, being sure to pick up and knit the wraps that are left over.  Doing these short rows in the round leaves  half of the wraps on each side un-worked  so that's an important step. And, I suspect, the trickiest part of converting this pattern. After this it's a piece of cake.   For the side shaping, I simply did a double decrease (there's directions  urlLink  here ) at the side markers. I used sl 2, k1, p2sso, but if I had it to do over again I'd have used ssk - k1- k2tog instead since it would have matched better with the increases.  For the increases, just increase on either side of the markers.   Here's a closeup of the shaping ...    When the work is the length given in the directions, just pick a side to be the front and work the short row shaping for the bust. Be sure you keep sight of which side is the front now, since once it's divided at the underarm you'll want that bust shaping in the front. ;o) After that work one round all the way around, picking up and knitting those wrapped stitches again, then divide at the underarms.   Use the side markers to know where to separate the two pieces. Cast off as in the directions at those markers on both sides and voila! the rest of the directions are as in the pattern since now you'll be working the sides flat, except for one little naggy bit : the numbers aren't entirely correct since you cast on 4 stitches too few. What I did was just follow the directions until the stitch count was correct. In other words, I left out the last two decreases since my stitch count was right (72 sts for the 38) without them.   Is this clear as mud?   Here's a picture of my Shapely just as I'm starting to work the back half...    I hope to get finished today. I tried it on like this last night (tricky with those needles still in it) and was very happy with the results. I can see myself making another one of these!

       I finished the back. I pinned the front and the back together hastily and asked my five year old to take my picture. I promise to never, ever again wear this  over  a shirt but it was only being held together by about 7 pins. Now I'm trying to decide if I should forge on and finish it or wait and take my Finishing for the Finicky class in May. I don't want to ruin my knitting with crappy finishing.

      Thanks for setting this up, Jessica!  I'm, thinking towards a second shapely as well. I'm leaning towards Paton's Katrina in Glacier and Ice with a stripe to make it a bit more interesting. And, I think I'll be trying it in the round as well. Of course, I'm not too far along with my first at the moment though... Maybe the second will be next year? LOL!

      I do have some white left in this color from the bikini I made.    Since I'm starting on the back - I hope to find out quickly when my yarn will run out.  Otherwise I will be spending $30 more at www.smileysyarns.com  I'm glad there is a version for doing this in the round - but I think it would take me like 30 minutes per row- there are so many stitches.  Boo hoo.

      It could be cute to do the garter stitch around the neck and arm holes in a different color--in case you run out of yarn.  Theresa has posted  urlLink instructions for knitting the tank in the round . Very cool.

      I decided to switch to size 5 needles (icky old metal ones). I've already altered the pattern stitch count - I also realize my bust is bigger than 38 inches - so I hope it will be a little looser.  I'm almost possitive I didn't buy enough yarn too :(  But no matter what... I'm happy to be knitting tonight!

      I'm so close to finishing. I'm just completing the garter bands. I loosely pinned the tank together yesterday and tried it on. It's not too oversized. It's a little baggy around the bottom. I definitely should have made mine a size or two smaller. Oh well. I still love the color and forget how wonderfully soft the yarn is (Classic Elite Premiere) until I touch it.  I did the D cup short rows and made 12 wraps.

      I'm pretty new to the knitalong, too. We're in the middle of moving, and just regained our internet connection today after a week long interruption. I'll be sure to post my progress just as soon as I find my digital camera.  I'm working the short rows for the bust shaping. I read the directions several times and think I understand what to do, but wanted to double check with some of you as well. Directions say to work short rows once for C-cup and twice for D-cup, etc. Would that mean to wrap 12 stitches on each side instead of 6 for a D-cup? Thanks for the input!

      I'm new to this knitalong and have never blogged before, so as you can see from the picture below, I figured out how to post a picture before I figured out how to post the text.  Oh, well.  I'm using Ornaghi Filati Rio in a grape/gray/pink colorway.  It's a little more pink in real life than in this picture.  I love the yarn (stretchy and variegated), but my gauge is off from the 5 sts and 7 rows per inch that Joan M-M called for in the pattern.  I'm at 5.7 sts and 8.8 rows per inch and so have to make the 44" size rather than my size of 38".  I also had to decrease every 4/5 rows alternatively, work 18 rows even, and increase every 6/7 rows alternatively in order to make it fit my torso.

      Amy, no scanner access either. I work at a rather large firm, and they have all the equipment, but scanning my tank top would probably be beyond the scope of my daily work!!!  I've started the front now, and am more pleased with the short rows. I had to rip it out once, as it seems I 'forgot' how to do the short rows and they looked pretty ridiculous and wonky. I went to the books, and found out I was senselessly complicating the matter. Once I refreshed my rememory on the correct way to short row, as well as how to pick up the wrap on the purl side, I was home free. It's looking pretty nice. Oh how I wish I could post a picture!  Now I have several inches of boring stockinette (since I'm knitting a shapless-shapely-tee), and will actually attempt the short rows for the bust. I really, really hope to wear this baby this year.

      Hi Mary,  I'd love to see your work so far - do you have access to a scanner?  I know that you wont get all of the tank on to it, but we'd get a taster!  My progress: none, so far - but I'll probably cast on within the next week or so.  Amy  See my other 'work'  urlLink here

      Well, I finished the back. It looks kinda big without the waist decrease/increases, but I have a feeling it's going to fit nicely. I've left the shoulder stitches on holders, because I love the 3 needle bind-off so much better than sewing it together. I wish I had a digital camera to show you my progress. The color is so pretty. Now to cast on for the front!

      Hi Shapely Tankers!   I made it back from Nicaragua. I took my Shapely T down with me and was able to spend a little time in the evenings ripping back to the short row section and then knitting for 1 1/2 inches before beginning the waist decreases. I'm currently at the "knitting 14 rows even" before doing the waist increases.

      Hi All. Just thought I'd post on progress on my (Not-So)Shapely Tank(or Tee). As I mentioned before, I'm not doing the waist shaping due to the fact that I no longer have one. So for me it's been straight knitting up to the underarms. I've now made it to the split for the two shoulders, so maybe in a few days the back of my Shapely will be done. I'm treating the back as sort of my test swatch, so once I do the front I'll feel more confident that I've got the short rows right. And I may be knitting the sleeves. That decision will come once I have the two pieces done & decide how much of my arms I don't want to see. But I'm really enjoying this!

      I've done some sprucing up around the blog. My Shapely is still sitting in a bag waiting for me to take my finishing class on the 22nd. I'm a little worried I made mine too long and have all sorts of nightmare visions of trying to cut the bottom off and fix it. How's everyone else doing?

      Hello all!  I'm a new KAL-er (if that's a real word!).  My name's Amy and I live in the UK.  I've not cast on for the tank yet, but I've been good and done my swatch.  I'm working the tank in Jaeger Cadiz yarn with a lace and cable panel up the middle.  I've got my own site where I've posted pictures and details:  urlLink  http://www.pickards.demon.co.uk/MyProjects/shapelytank.htm    I look forward to seeing everyone elses progress.

      Yipeeee. It is done. I finished my Shapely Tank last night. Well the knitting was done the previous day but I didn't feel up to weaving in the ends. Not a fan of ends LOL  The armholes and neck were a little loose so I undid my cast-offs and re-did them tighter. Normally I cast-off too tight so I made sure that I didn't this time. DUH! I should have just done it an normal.  It is a perfect fit now.  Will take a pic as soon as I have a bit more time.  Jackie - http://www.karpstyles.com/blog/index.html

      Mary, do you mean "not so shapely" just because of the sleeves?  Or the body of it in general too?    I keep hearing that it is coming out baggy on people.  Someone recommended that I adust the pattern.  I'm working on the smallest size (36) because I really am a small person.  But now I'm wondering if even that will be too big.  I really want it to be "shapely" (even if I'm not!).  Michele

      Well, after finishing both back & front of my not-so-shapely-tank, and knitting up the neckband, I tried it on and it decided it wants sleeves. I'm knitting both together and am at the cap shaping, so with a little luck and some spare time (hah!) maybe I'll be able to finish my not-so-shapely-tank-that's-now-a-tee in the next week. I only wish I had a digital camera so that I could post a picture, but I'll try to describe it once I'm done. It definitely won't be before the weekend, so I'd like to wish a Happy 4th of July to all in the US of A (Happy Birthday to US), and a good weekend to the rest.

      Hey Michele.  I think you should do whatever works best for you, but I decided not to do it in the round, even though I saw the pattern adaptation (thanks to the person who did that, though I confess I forgot your name).  I tend to do anything I can in the round, but I decided that it would be more trouble to keep track of the increases and decreases around the waist than it would be to sew the darned thing up when I was done.  It's only four seams and two of them are just an inch and a half and can be kitchenered if you want.  So that's my $0.02.  But I fully support you if you decide to do it in the round, and I'll be interested to hear how it goes!  As for me, I have done maybe two rows today, sigh.  It took DD TWO HOURS to fall asleep tonight (2-year molars will be the death of me!).  So no downtime for me!  Well, I suppose I'm just staying up late for it instead. :)  Cate

      Anyone doing this in the round?  I've started it several times because I keep losing track (it's easy to go back the opposite way in the round).  I think if I knew better how to "read" my knitting, I'd be able to figure it out.  I also started it over in the round only to realize I'm still confused about some of the directions for it this way.  Anyone have an opinion, considering I could go either way at this point.

      I finished the front on Saturday, and posted it to my regular blog, but forgot to do it here.  I cast on the back at the same time and am now ready to start increasing after the waist.       Here's a picture of my finished front and the back at the 4th waist decrease, which is where I had to add on the second ball of yarn.  I'm running into slight guage and finish problems because, although I was morally certain all my yarn was Peaches&Creme but it turns out only the "Dalmation" variegated is.  The black is Sugar&Cream and the white is Bernat Kitchen cotton.  How I made this mistake with all balls/cones in the same bag?  No idea.  Hopefully it won't matter terribly badly, and neither will the (Doh!) row and a half of twisted stitches across the shoulders in the white.  (donks self on forehead) The next one will be better, and this will always be my first Shapely Tank and the first entire article of clothing I've kntted myself, so special despite (or because of?) the flaws.

      Hello!  I'm a bit more than halfway through with my tank.  i did make some alterations to the pattern, so i'll actually be able to wear it this summer (i'm pregnant.)  don't have any pictures yet.. but it's out of red sugar 'n cream cotton.

Now if I can do the back as quickly, I'll be wearing this after the 4th of July!  No promises, though...&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Here's my progress to date on the front.  This is as of Friday morning (started Monday night).  You can see that the variegation is different in the short-row section vs. the rest, which does not bode well for the bust.  I know there's some way to fix that by using multiple balls of yarn (alternating rows?) but that might involve too much thinking, LOL.  Well, I might do it anyway. :)  I'm almost done with the decreases now.  I want to wear this asap, so I want to do it fast!  One bummer--I noticed that the yarn says dry clean only.  Sigh.  I have sworn off dry clean only clothes since the kids were born, but I suppose I can make an exception for handknits.&nbsp; urlLink

      Yep, me again.  I'm so enthused about the way this is going, now that I actually have it going, that I can't stop knitting on it.  Or showing around the pictures like a little kid.  Only two this time:      I decided to do the front in 3/4 variegated, 1/4 white and the whole back in plain black...I'm wishing now I'd done a row of solid black before starting the white, for definition.  Oh, well, dreams of my next tank are already swimming in my head... The whole thing is in Peaches'n Creme Cotton, btw, and believe me, after this much knitting, I'm wishing I'd chosen something with a little give...

      Hi, everyone. Everything's been going swimmingly with the tank excpet that I took off for a month to visit my aunt and take care of her during her eye surgery, and forgot to bring it, hence getting no progress until yesterday.  Okay, bring on the pictures!  They are from, respectively, one month ago, yesterday afternoon, and tonite.  Yayy!  I'm so excited to start the back.

      Hi folks!  New here...I guess I'm joining a big late but why not!  I shopped my stash last night and have just done the 6 rows of edging.  Well, here's what I wrote about it in my (newly resuscitated) blog:   I'm also just about to join the shapely tank knitalong as soon as I'm done sending out a survey mailing from another window (which makes my return address look funky). I've cast on using some ribbon yarn that has been languishing in my stash for at least 5 years. I had started another tank with larger needles, and it was just dreadful. When I swatched it for the shapely tank, I realized that I was in the right gauge for the yarn and it was perfect! I no longer hate this yarn! Plus, I got the exact gauge in one try, which is always a good sign. I did the edging in seed stitch, and I'll start the short rows--er--shortly. :)  I have been knitting for almost 20 years (hard to believe, but I'm 34 and started at 15 or so!), and I've made short-row socks, but this whole wrapping thing is new to me. I *am* familiar with the little holes that wrapping is supposed to eliminate, but I'll be doing something new to me, so that will be interesting. I'm also excited that this pattern has adjustments for the well-endowed! Since nursing twins, I am a 34-G, which is just a weird size and no clothes are made for me. I either look like I should be nabbed for solicitation or I look like I'm wearing a tent. So now I can do short rows for the bust and not BUST out of the thing when I try to wear it. Hooray! I'm a little concerned that the variegated yarn is going to show up with weird stripes around the bust (making it that much more accented) but I'm hoping that the color changes are short enough (only about 2 inches apiece) that it will come out in more of a "popcorn" look than stripes, if that makes sense. So far, based on the swatch and the edging, that's what's happening. I should remember this for yarn design.   The yarn is "Unger Escape Ribbon;" I can't find a photo of it online so I'll try to take a pic when I'm home with my digital camera.  Happy knitting!  Cate

      Melissa you are entirely right!!!!  I took your advice. Set it aside for a day or so and calmed down (I can get pretty 'wrapped up' at times). I counted the stiches and it turns out I only flubbed the underarm bindoff's. that's why the results were tweaked. I didn't bind off enough and that is how everything got off track. Doh! Still does not explain why I cannot count stitches and keep track of things properly. I went to the bottom, and by inserting a yarn marker every 25 stitches, I counted. The cast on turns out to be fine. I did the same just below the point where I began the underarm bind off's and it was the same count. Good. Embarrassing, but good. LOL! This whole dramatic scene just further underscores the embarrassing fact that I cannot count and should keep my online voice quiet until I've taken a few breaths and calmed down.  So, I am back on track and knitting the bindoff's this afternoon. I'll post the pictures of the finished back on my next update.  yours truly,  Jocelyn

        My questions are: I have to cut the edges to get it the right shape at the top, right? What happens to the short row shaping at the bottom then? Should I cut it off too, or try to angle the cut? If I cut it off, what's the point of doing the short rows at the bottom of the front part (I did the back first to hide my sins)? The extra inches at the bottom would be nice for hip ease, so angling would be preferable, but then the rows won't match up on the sides  Jocelyn, um...where are you getting the idea that anything has to be cut?  Once you finish the front & back, you sew one shoulder together then pick up stitches around the neckline and work 6 rows of garter stitch.  Then you sew the other shoulder together & pick up stitches around the armhole,like for the neck, & work garter stitches.  Then the other armhole is worked the same as the first.  Sew the side seams, steam to block and you're done.  The armholes won't look so huge after you work the 6 rows of garter stitches.    Sorry you had to frog so much of it, but I can't wait to see the finished tank.  Your color selections a so bright and happy.  I'd just go back and count the first row and make sure you have the correct number of stitches.  If you do, just work your way up the tank & look at the instructions to try and find where things went wonky.  Good luck!

      RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPP  Yep. That's what I did last night. About 8 inches of teeny tiny sockinette stitches on the old Shapely Tank. When I got to the part where I was supposed to bind off the center front I discovered that I had somehow cast on an additional 13 stitches!!!!   Naturally, I have no idea how that happened. I must have counted the darn thing at least five times when I initially cast on at the beginning of the project. I was very careful about the whole thing. But there I was, at the top of the back panel with thirteen extra stitches. Did the stitches multiply somehow? I checked my rows, everything was done just right with no accidental increases. I must have brain farted on a massive scale this time. At that point I made my first mistake: I decided to knit the tank the rest of the way to see if I could compensate for the extra stitches in the neck shaping.   When I got all the way finished with the sockinette portion of my shapely tank, I discovered that I didn't have the straps thin enough and the armholes were too HUGE to look normal. I still had 14 more rows of decreases to get the tank straps to the pattern's specification and the tank was already at the maximum length I was supposed to knit. So I ripped it back to the last underarm bind off and am taking a small break to ponder and reflect.  My questions are: I have to cut the edges to get it the right shape at the top, right? What happens to the short row shaping at the bottom then? Should I cut it off too, or try to angle the cut? If I cut it off, what's the point of doing the short rows at the bottom of the front part (I did the back first to hide my sins)? The extra inches at the bottom would be nice for hip ease, so angling would be preferable, but then the rows won't match up on the sides.   Sigh. It's a dilemma.  Maybe I should frog the whole thing...  Jocelyn

      Hi, I am introducing myself.  I'm Michele, in Seattle.  I started the tank a few weeks ago.  But when I did the part of picking up the wraps for the short rows at the bottom, on one of the sides it made a ridge, very crispy.  I frogged it.  Now I've started over, doing it in the round.  I haven't gotten to the crispy part yet.  I think when I do, I'll bring it to a Stitch N Bitch for some validation.  I must have done something wrong the first time around.  The knitalong will motivate me, I hope.  I have a history of moving so slowly on a project that I could barf on it by the time I've been looking at it for months.    Michele

      Well, as is typical for me I've changed my mind!  I'm still knitting the tank, but in a different yarn and with a different pattern.  I'm participating in another KAL: the Cable Tee on the  urlLink Ample Knitters  list, and I've decided to make a cardigan-tank twin set.  So, my new tank will be in Noro Lily (a cotton/silk mix - got on eBay for a bargain) with either one or two cables running up the centre front and back.  I'll still work a v-neck, and everything else will stay the same.  I'll post a pic of the back of the cardigan/tank (I haven't decided which it will turn into yet!) as soon as I can wrestle the digital camera off my brother!  My swatch:  urlLink http://www.pickards.demon.co.uk/MyProjects/cabletee.htm  (click on the picture of the cabled swatch to get a close-up of the rib and cable I've used).

      I actually knit a few rows on Shapely T last night! Daughter has a basketball game tonight, so I will get another hour or so of knitting done on this project.   I am finding that I am a bit bored with the Shapely T; however, I will persevere because I committed to the knit-a-long and I do love the look of the garment and the yarn I chose.

      I'm working on the front, and almost up to the bust short-rows. I have a question about them. The pattern says the short-rows are for C or D cup. I'm a B cup. Do you think it would be wise to do some short-rowing anyway, maybe a few less than for the C cup? Or would it be better to omit them altogether?

      Joan: Your tank looks great. The variegated yarn gives it a lot of interest.  I found another great Shapely while surfing today. Joanne wasn't part of our knitalong but  urlLink her Shapely  is really nice. She added a seed stitch border and purl stitches throughout the body to break up the stockinette.

      I finished Shapely last Monday and even wore it Tuesday, but didn't get around to taking a picture of it until today.  Overall, I'm really pleased with the way it turned out.  I like the fit and think the directions were clear and well-written, with the exception of where to place the short-rows for the bust (I think this question came up previously), although the schematic on this point  was  very specific.  I made the short-rows for C-cup, but I think if I did it again, I'd make it for D, and also do the neckband, armbands and bottom garter stitch in a contrasting color.  Thanks for letting me into this knit-a-long, and thanks to Jessica for hosting it.  I'm eager to see everyone's finished tank!  Happy knitting and warm regards, Joan

      Hello knit along readers. My shapely tank is coming along quite nicely as you can see below. The green and the pink are really complimentary in the sunlight and I am halfway to the place where I knit in the bright orange. I begin the underarms right after I knit in the orange.      Here is the grouping of yarn that is going into this tank. Looks sunny, right?      A bit of a closeup and you can see these colors are luminescent in the sunlight. Moreover, the sunlight is where I plan to wear this top.      I had a bit of a problem getting the right circular needles for this project. I slipped the project off onto my straight needles three times so I could exchange the ones I was using before I finally got the length just right - addi turbo 32"s. Chalk another snafu up to an inexperienced knitter. LOL! As a result I have a few twisted stitches in the green section from slipping and ripping the green section a few days ago.  I spoke to  urlLink Amber from Yarn in Loops  fame at a knitting function recently and I was reassured that it is not unheard of to knit the back of a sweater first. So that is what I have planned to do to keep this first project moving. I guess I won't win any picky knitter awards soon. LOL! The good news is that the tank looks close to perfect with only a bit of a fold now and then in a few places. My hair will cover most of it anyway and with fingers crossed, I am optimistic that the front will come out better.   Blog at you soon! I am off to knit the rest of the pink.

      I haven't really had a chance to do much knitting, but here's a pic of the front of the tank. I'm still at the bust short rows, but perhaps I'll have a chance to pick it up tonight.

      Mary, When you publish a post it appears right here.  urlLink http://shapelytank.blogspot.com/   This is the same page that you link to when you click on the "View Blog." Your posts are showing up. Otherwise we couldn't see them. Clearly, you're able to see my posts over the last few days or you wouldn't be responding to them. Were there other posts you wrote that didn't appear on the blog? Maybe those were saved as drafts and never published?

      OK, I guess there "is" some confusion. See the tab above that says "Veiw Blog", underlined? When you click on that it takes you to the Knitalong site, where you don't post, just read what members have already posted. When I first started posting in here, once I published my post it showed up in that site. Click on it and see. That's my post, the last one that is dated May 18, about having no scanner access. I guess someone changed the settings, since the posts no longer go there once they're published.

      Hi All, I'm afraid my knitting suffered from the 3 day holiday weekend. I maybe did two rows. I do hope to get back to it, as now it's June and I'd love to wear it this year. I'm just wondering, how come none of the recent posts are showing up in the Tankalong website?

      Good Morning everyone! I am Jocelyn in San Diego and have just gotten involved in this Knitalong as well. I am zipping along - about 25% done now, and will post some pics when I am close to finishing the front. Thanks for having me and I am really enjoying reading everyone's contributions.

      I haven't been posting my progress, but I just wanted to report that I'm finished!  I used Lion Brand Microspun in Buttercup.  Like many others, mine also turned out to be too loose, but I figure better too loose than too tight!  I also haven't blocked it yet, but I think there's only one area that truly needs it.  The short rows on the bottom cause the garter stitch portion to keep flipping (curling) up.  Has anyone else had that problem?  If I make another, I think I'll omit the bottom short rows and have a straight hem.  I'll also use a smaller gauge or go to the next size down (or both).

       urlLink    FO!  I finished seaming and weaving in ends in the car on my way home from vacation.  Mine is a little tight in the bust but I expected that; otherwise it fits well, if a little clingy.  I had an interesting discussion with my fellow-knitter friend on vacation about sizing.  She is a skater, and she has been reading up about fitted garment design, as she prepared to sew some skating garb.  The information she read said that most patterns (sewing and knitting) are designed for a B cup (though this one claims a C cup).  If you are better-endowed than that, you should measure ABOVE the bustline, just at your underarms, to get the chest circumference.  I know that for me (34G), it would be a big problem if I had made the pattern in a 41" size (my full bust measurement).  Instead, I made the 36" and included bust darts as per the pattern.  I was scared to make the darts any longer for fear they would cross one another, so I only did two sets of short rows, for an E cup.  That's okay, since I'm breastfeeding and I expect my boobs to return to normal someday, LOL.  But anyway, I think the sizing issue may be at fault for some of the folks who had problems.  I hate to think of anyone frogging an entire sweater--do you have any friends who are fluffier than you who might be eternally grateful for a handknitted tank top?  Could they buy you more yarn if $ is an issue?  Anyway, I know how frustrating it is to finish (or nearly) a project and find out it's completely wrong (click on my blog link to see how very well I know this--the other project I've been working on met that fate this week).  Make lemonade whenever you can.  Photo on actual bod will be forthcoming--DP is asleep so no one to take a pic of me in it!

      I have been reading everyone's entries, and was glad to hear about your trouble with sizing.  I always think my troubles have something to do with my not being careful enough.  I was almost through with the front of my shapely tank (or tee) and it looked huge.  So I frogged it, and have restarted. But here is my thought about the sizing issue.  I am pretty large on top, and my thinking is that the top might have been overly large on me because I usually buy/make tops so that they will fit over my boobs.  But in this case, I don't need to size up because the extra fabric is built into the design.  So I am doing this version in the 42" size rather than the 44" size that I used the first time through.  I don't know if it will work out or not, but I figure I can give it a try--knowing how much extra fabric there was when I was done with the short row shaping (I wear a 34 G bra size--that means six sets of short row shaping!), I am hoping that this downsizing will really help with the fit.  Anyone else have any ideas about this?

      since i was adapting it to be a maternity tank, i wound up doing the next size up on the bottom (figuring my belly would get a bit bigger)&nbsp; and the top part in my size.&nbsp; i must've FUBAR'd my guaging a bit bigger than what it was supposed to be, so it wound up being an absolute tent.&nbsp;&nbsp; somehow though, i don't think my guaging alone accounted for it being 40 stitches too wide. :/  i would've just made it smaller via the seams, but then the neckline and armholes&nbsp;would've been way weird, and i didn't like how the shaping on the bottom turned out.&nbsp; so... i started over.

       I've been on vacation, and got married, etc., etc., but when I got back I sewed up all my pieces. And I really hate it. I made it without the shaping so as not to emphasize my bulges, and followed the size closest to my bust size. It's baggy. And the sleeves! I can't believe how huge and&nbsp;baggy the sleeves are. Now I have some decisions to make.     &nbsp;  I refuse to just frog the whole thing. I'm thinking of undoing the seams (I did mattress stitch seams) and sewing it together with a yarn more forgiving than the cotton I used. And to make it fit better, I might sew the seams in a little bit (do the shaping I should have to begin with, doh!) and cut off the excess (like steeking I guess). Then, as far as the sleeves are concerned, I could just take them off and make armhole bands. Or I could do something creative and sew a middle seam down the sleeve to make it less baggy. But I'll probably take the sleeves off, that seems to make more sense.    &nbsp;  So, ladies - those of you who have had problems - you're not the only ones who find the whole damn thing just not fitted properly. I really hate to spend so much time on a project and then find out it's probably a bad pattern (for me at least). It's very frustrating. I guess those of you who ended up with a lovely tank are more proficient than I am. But I'm not giving up!

      I went with the size closest to my measurements and did a swatch and everything (I'm a super-tight knitter, so I ended up doing several swatches and knitting the whole thing on 7's for 6x7 instead of 5x7/in--not perfect, but I'm lazy).  I've only finished the front and half the back, so I may be speaking to soon, but the way my front looks and measures after blocking should fit me well/snug.  Of course, I'm going with the 5th size inside the parentheses, so probably I fudged my measurements small to flatter myself and that's why it's the right size...If I'd finished it in good time instead of taking a break from it for two months to knit a bunch of crap I can't wear until winter (in a more northern state!), I would remember exactly what went on in my head during cast-on.  ;0)  I think how you relate to different patterns depends on who you are and how your head works--there are a million tank patterns, so there's going to be one you grok immediately and love and knit a million times, even if it  isn't  this one.  Take heart! Kellye

      With them being on the giagantic side, did you guys use the size that seemed to match up to your measurements?  Because I measure up with the smallest size.  I don't have anywhere downward to go and I don't have it in me to do the math right now.  I cut my left index finger badly on July 4 so I have really slowed down.  Plus, some people around me, seeing me rip out the short rows like 8 times, told me to put it down for a while.  I kept working on them in social knitting settings and then finding mistakes when I got home.     I love the yarn I choose (Cotton Classic); maybe I should use another tank pattern.  There must be tons.  Any thoughts, Michele

      yeah.. i know what you mean.  i'm debating myself.  i mean, i had planned on this as something for my pregnancy, but, i have _so_ many other things to do, and if it takes me a couple of weeks, well... we'll see. :P  i may just save it and make it for next year.

      I don't think it's your math abilities.  I did a swatch, took measurements, and my tank is also a bit on the gigantic side.  I'm just working on some spinning, trying to convince myself to frog the whole thing and start over in a smaller size ;P

      thanks! that makes much more sense than 2. :P  so i got the front and back done, and sewn up.  tried it on, and it's HUMONGUS.  so, i'm starting over, with some modifications.  i'm not going to do the bottom shaping.  it just looked too wierd with the cotton. it just didn't lay right.  second one should be much faster, since i am making it 25 stiches narrower!  i did do a guage swatch! really!  i must just not be able to do math... or something.

      so i'm almost up to the increases on the back.  the front is "done"  i'm hoping i got the short rows right for the bustline.   when it says "1 time for a C, 2 times for a D etc..." does that mean that there should be 2 wraps on each side for a D?  it's what i thought, but now that i'm done, it just doesn't seem quite enough.  i decided rather belatedly, that i was going to wear this thing tomorrow.  :-P  yeah.  right.  we'll see how much more i get done today.  i've spent nearly 6 hours and i've got about 20 more rows before i get to the armholes.    Happy 4th everyone!

      Michelle, I'm calling mine the 'not-so-shapely' because I decided not to do any shaping. My body doesn't have much shape any more, so I've made the tank straight up and down (like me!) wihtout the decreases and increases. I can only  hope  it doesn't turn out baggy. But then again, cotton does have a tendency to sag with wearing. What the heck, I'll wear it anyway. I'll be proud to say I made it myself. Mary

      Duh!  I can't believe I didn't think of that!  The reason mine fits me is that my mom (a seamstress from way back) measured me for the pattern and told me which parenthetical (5th one) to use pattern-wide.  I hope it helps everyone who hasn't already become disheartened.  I've been thinking of you guys, and hoping everything would come out right.  If you don't have the heart to knit a whole new Shapely, maybe you need one of the tops from the new Knitty?  For Pete's sake, you deserve something fabulous!  My own Shapely should be done by the weekend and we'll just see if it fits, given my newbie knitter tendancy to think, "Oh, maybe it won't matter..." I'll post pics as soon as it's done.

       ...most patterns (sewing and knitting) are designed for a B cup (though this one claims a C cup). If you are better-endowed than that, you should measure ABOVE the bustline, just at your underarms, to get the chest circumference.  Cate, that makes so much sense that I'm dumb-struck. I always buy button-up shirts in XL to prevent from hurting anyone with flying buttons, but generally a medium in tee's and pullovers since they're stretchy. I went with the 44" finished to take into account bust measurements and ended up with a monster of a tank. I've finally worked up the nerve to frog the thing and re-knit it. My knitting has gotten lots faster since I put the tank down, so there will still be warm weather once it's done. Looks like I'll try it again for the 38" finished bust. Six inches will make a huge difference.

      Cate: Your tank looks wonderful. I'm so happy you're pleased with it.  I'm sorry this project has become so frustrating for so many of the knitalongers. I was starting to feel like I was hosting a cursed knitalong. Not every project will work for every knitter. But I think that there is a lot to be learned in solving your knitting problems. There can also be great relief in letting go of projects that are making you crazy.

      Here's my photo of the tank "on."  I'm pretty pleased with it.  I've made plenty of too-big sweaters in my time, so I'm glad to finally understand how to measure when you're not a b-cup.  I wore the sweater to work and felt really good about it.  I hope those who have one that's too big can find someone for whom it will fit and look fabulous to gift it to.  urlLink

      After reading of everyone's problems with this tank(tee), I'm wondering why on earth anyone would want to make another one, no less frog it and start over. I've tried seaming my baggy tank an inch smaller on each side. It still looks bad. So I thought maybe I need to seam the underarm part a little tighter. And then I wondered how the heck I was supposed to get a proper band on the armholes if I did that. And now it's just hit me - why the heck don't I just rip the whole dang thing out, period? When a garment gives so much trouble, maybe nothing at all will fix it. I really feel cheated, after spending so much time knitting it up, and waiting expectantly for the results. The yarn just might make a better-looking baby sweater!
