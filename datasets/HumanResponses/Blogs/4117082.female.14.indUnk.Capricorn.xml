       Dreams. They can sumtimes be so real. Sum turn into nightmares and sum into wishes come true. Well not really, cuz they are only dreams. I truly believe that all my dreams mean sumthin. Y? Well here's an example. When skool ended i never heard from this sumone ever again. All throughout the summer i kept having dreams that sumhow i had lost them or for sum reason i couldn't find them. Then finally after summer was almost over i recieved sumthin from them. That night i had the best dream ever. I'm not gonna go into all the details but here are the main points. This person and i were together and niether of us would let each other go. We couldn't be seperated! I really think it means somethin. I guess you have to kno all the details to all my dreams to feel as strongly about this as i do. Or u can just go bak to your own dreams and go through them like i did. Then you'll understand. (If u don't already.)

       I'm soo wired and cornfuzed. One min. I'm fine and the next min. I start remembering......... I love the memories, but sumtimes I wish I had never ended it. Y the hell DID I end it?! Oh, I remember y. It's all my fault. Those precious memories came AFTER and not during. I guess I couldn't control it. I hope I'm not the only one feeling this way.  Actually I hope the other end of this knot is as determined as I am to untie it and start all over again. I wish it could all be real. I wish I could still live with it. But 4 now, all I have are my memories....

       Guyz....sumting I've noticed about them is that they're multi-sided. Well, wat I mean is, they have different sides or faces. For example; they could be all cool but mean with they're guy frends and all nice and dorky with their guy/girl group of frends. Usually, (well from mine and my frends expiriences) there's a side of guyz that only one special person gets to see. That side of them is funny, sweet, caring, kind, and everything else u can think of that's good. When they show u THAT side of them, u grow to like them, even if u hated them and thought they were gay in the past. At times u wonder, wat the hell am I thinking? I can't like them? they're soo mean to my best frend...But then as u see that special side more often u can't resist it, and u just HAVE to like them. Even if u don't want to. Sumtimes even the word LOVE comes to mind. Ure friends and or family think ure crazy for liking THAT guy. And in a way u are. Ure crazy about HIM. Not for liking him. The thing is, ure friends and family can't see this guyz *special* side. Cuz this side is only for u. And if for sum reason other ppl start seeing this side, then sumtin is not rite. Cuz it's supposed to be special, not for everyone else to expirience. When this side is not *special* anymore, ppl break up, and there's a lot of anger or sadness. Or both! Because this *special* feelings is the glue that holds 2 ppl together. And when that is lost, anything, even a feather, can make the whole thing collapse.

       It sux being a middle child. Your older siblings boss u around and make fun of u for being younger. Your younger siblings blame things on you and get EVERYTHING they want cuz they're spoiled. If your older siblings were caught doing bad things, your parents assume ure going to do the same thing and have absolutely no confidence in you. After you prove yourself responsible and trustworthy you're old enuff to do watever u please so it doesn't even matter. THEN, since you turn out to be "good kid", your parents give all their trust to the younger child and let them do watever the hell they want. Those are just a few things that suck about being middle children. There's a lot more, it just depends on your lifestyle and how much your parents suck. There's only one thing middle children get and middle children ONLY! A brain.
