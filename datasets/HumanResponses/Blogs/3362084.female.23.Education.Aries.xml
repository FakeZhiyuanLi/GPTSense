      As some of you already know I have a very good friend (Chris) who is teaching English in Japan.  Finally, with the help of my friend I am scheduled to go from the 17th of June until the next Sat (26th) to be there.  Soo excited to not only see Chris but the go to the mother land and see what life is like in a place where there is actually some culture.  The only other place that had an ounce of culture was Mexico but that was like 4 years ago.  Ahhhh I am strangely nervous to go on the plane, its seriously been 4-5 years since I've stepped into one.  All that waiting and searching people for bombs or some nail clippers.  Luckily my friends who I am going with have been on a plane within the last 6 months so I am in pretty good hands.

      Most of you are probably wondering what this title is about and basically it is called my weekend.  First off I handed over my lab rat "Stitch" to a Miss Sara Morimoto and I am not sure how I feel about it.  Its strange to think something I called my own is now in Sara's hands.  The grad part of my weekend of was Miss Kristen Sasaki graduating from the super expensive UOP, it was nice short ceremony and good food at the little after celebration.  And the baby part... no no I am not pregnant but my friend is.  She is going to have a boy in August and I haven't seen Liz since before she knew she was expecting.  It really makes me feel old because she's only a year older than me and hasn't graduated from college yet.  Damn, life is more than I thought it would be.  Very emotional good and bad, true and false.

      Yesterday I went to go see "Troy" with my buddy Jeff.  We started talking about movies we had seen recently and I realized that I see a movie almost once a week.  In the last month or so I've seen "13 going on 30", "Mean Girls", "Van Helsing", "Shrek 2" & just yesterday "Troy".  Now those are the movies I've seen in the theater, I haven't taken into account the borrowed/rented/purchased DVD's.  Think of all that money that has gone into seeing these movies, prices ranging from $5.50-$8.50 each time.  Now is it that I am so into movie culture or I just have way too much time on my hand?

      No, no I am not going to be a WWE Diva, but apparently my brother is.  The form is sitting here right next to his laptop.  Anyone who knows me understands that this is bizarre even for my family.  I haven't watched wrestling since the mid 80's (insert Devo song) so you know it isn't mine.  But really the only reasonable explanation is that Emily his gf is going to try out.  Hell she did try out to be a Kings dancer, who knows this could be here thing.

      I have to put this post up about this really bizarre dream I had last night.  First of all I was in front of a slot machine with some other people and we all put money in and got three "7" in a row.  I think "Yay, we won," the number "370" flashes on the screen so I take the ticket to redeem it for money.  Well instead they give each of us a nice shiny handgun.  Me I am thinking "What the hell, I've never even held a real gun let alone use it!"  So than I go into this cafeteria like area to go eat with some friends when all of a sudden my former housemate (Chhimi) storms in.  Apparently in this dream he is a police officer/FBI that type of person and he proceeds to arrest me for having things on my computer I didn't pay for (updated windows programs and all the "shared" music).  I freak out and hand over my gun I won from the slot machine and he takes me away, but not in cuffs.    BOOM I wake up confused as hell.

      I would not say I am stuck in Lodi like the song, but I am back here for those that I haven't talk to in a while.  Starting to adjust to having dad and derrick pop in and out of the house.  Haven't seen his gf or any of his "friends" lately.  Everyone is going about their business and I've thus far stayed out of trouble(knock on wood).  Only two more weeks and than Japan trip!!!!!

      Recently I have been biking with either my former roomies or my father.  When I started back using my own bike I noticed two things.  One, the permit on the bike expired Dec. 31, 1994 and two - my Schwinn Sidewinder bike has a little symbol that looks like a sperm.  No it really looks like a sperm!  Anyone who wants to see I'll show you, its funky!

      Needless to say it was a very long time before we made it to Christophers studio apartment.  A good 10 hours 35 minutes on the plane, 4 trains ranging from 20 - 70 minutes a piece and a short taxi ride - boom were there.  As the plane lands on Osaka I think "oh its soo pretty, look at all of the green."  But when I go on the 3 rd train ride, I see all the high-rise buildings, neon signs and very fuel efficient cars I have a slightly different view.  Reminds me so much of Japantown SF and Little Tokyo in LA.  Don't get me wrong I am sooo happy to be here, its just I guess I imagined the lush green lands and large mountains.  After being awake for 28 hours of being up and eating lots of meat at Korean place, finally passed out on a couch that is probably 2/3 the length of me.  Today is the end of day two and Chris, Jen, Matt and myself have basically shopped and of course ate and drank- and I mean drank. I drank so much that I even had to go outside for fresh air.  Although going outside in Japan this time of year doesn't help because it is so humid, warm and raining.  The good thing is that getting sick low point of the whole trip so everything else is going to be downhill from here.  Sayonara all!

      Yes the time has finally come, the day I have been waiting for since the end of last year.  I am going to Japan, yes I am going to visit the mother land.  See all the sites and smell all that is what my ancestors have worked so hard for.  I realize that I am going at such an appropriate time, Chris is turning 23 the day after I arrive.  Its going to be so much fun but also strange because it will be the first time I'll have complete culture shock.  All the Kanji around me, calculating all of the Yen to see if I am getting ripped off or not.  I am having all of these crazy thoughts about what it will be and its only a little into the day at which I am leaving.  A smart person would be sleeping right now, all tucked in bed with thoughts of little geisha running around and perverted business men drinking their sake.  I leave Thursday and arrive Friday, its like I am experiencing the second Back to the Future movie.  Damn that's the crappy one, oh well!  All I know now is that I won't be in California anymore - even with all of the designer names running around and badly bleached hair.  Everyone there is going to look similar to me, I'll be playing "where is the white person" (similar to where is Waldo, you know).  I am so tired right now but can't get a wink of sleep.  I will keep all two of you who read my blog on a regular basis posted with my experiences in Japan.  Thank goodness Chris has internet and they have all those dot com cafe places.  The one advantage of being in the city, boy I might be ready to tackle New York one of these days.  But first I'll have to see how I fair with Japan.  Any feedback would be awesome, I know I have several misspellings and grammar but I don't care at this point because I am going to Japan. AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Approximately 6 hours and I will be on a train home with Jen and Matt.  This has been a wonderful trip with a great mix of modern technology and culture, like today went from one extreme to the other.  We did some shopping in Downtonwn Hiroshima which was very neat, had a very San Francisco feel minus the hills.  And after that we ate dinner at the Nakamoto's which are Chris and Jen's relatives from around Hiroshima area.  They have a nursery, like for plants and apparently make a good living doing that.  We ate lots of noodles, fish, chicken, vegetables and stuff you'd have at a normal Japanese get together feeding more than 25 people.  It was very interesting because they spoke lots of English and were very enthused about asking all of us question such as "what university you go to?" or "what you like most in Japan?"  Later at night we all went to an arcade just to play some games.  Matt won Jen a little baby Eeyore in a tiny bottle, it cost them about 1000 yen to finally fish from the claw machine.  I played Chris air hockey and did pretty well at first and than I was just watching the puck go into my goal.  Ah and finally we did those little fobby picture booths, if anyone wants to see let me know or ask any of the other people who went on this trip, if you know them.  It will be a while until I'll have something interesting to blog so do enjoy.

      The last few days on my trip to Japan has been raining.  Monday especially since there was the typhoon that was heading towards Hiroshima but missed it and went to Osaka which was where we were that day.  We've gone around so many places both historic and modern.  My favorite thus far had to be Miwajima, you know that torii and all the dears running around looking for people to feed them.  It was totally how I imagined Japan like how you see on the TV, movies and text books.  Despite the mix of rain and humidity, it hasn't stopped my friends and me from going place.

      There is no denying that Hawaii is one of the nicest places to be for vacation but for me it turned out to be a headache.  First of all I pulled my lower back muscle from carrying other people bags along with mine.  Second when I was climbing Diamond Head with my family I ran up the 99 steps and got so light-headed that I passed out a couple of times.  As a result of that I had to be ushered out to a helicopter to take me back down the mountain.  Next was the trip to the Queen hospital in Honolulu where they let me wait near the nurses station to get a diagnosis.  While I was there I got some pills to relax the muscles so my back could get better.  The trip home from Hawaii, I am told that my great aunt passed away this Monday.  Basically that put me over the edge and I have been pretty stressed the pass week because of all the stuff going on.

      From the last time I blogged things have gone up.  My back does not hurt anymore, the biggest plus ever.  My little ER visit in Hawaii cost is around $700+, thanks Queens Medical Center!  The bigger focus of my life is that fun job hunt.  I've been working on the sub teaching application for about 5 days now and its a slow process.  Finally got rid of the feeling that I am in some type of moving vehicle, Jen knows what I am talking about.  Being on vacation for the time I was had the whole mixed blessing/curse thing going.  Hope all the rest of you are well!  Thanks for all the comments and concern.

      With the happenings of summertime fun back in the cowtown I've rather enjoyed the freedom of staying out late,&nbsp; not having to pay rent & seeing my family more than I did these last few months.&nbsp; People kept on telling me you'll go crazy being back home because you've&nbsp;grown.&nbsp;&nbsp;But actually I&nbsp;learned to adapt to my surroundings better since I made the big move to Rancho Cordova (No its not as ghetto as people say).&nbsp; The only reason I say I am having a moment is&nbsp;because I realize with all the bad stuff that has happened&nbsp;in my world because things have gone the way it has I&nbsp;consider myself to be a very lucky human being.&nbsp; I never go hungry, I have shelter,&nbsp;clothed most of the time (hehe)&nbsp;and people love me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Yes those things have one important thing in common, they are both Huey Lewis and the News songs. The reason I bring them up is because they are on tour currently and they are making a stop at the California State Fair on Labor Day weekend. I've already asked one of my die hard 80's friend if she'd like to join me but was hesitation. I'm superexcited about seeing them because ever since Back to the Future I've been a big fan. Call me a dork if you want but its been a big thrill for me since I read about them coming to Sacramento next month.
