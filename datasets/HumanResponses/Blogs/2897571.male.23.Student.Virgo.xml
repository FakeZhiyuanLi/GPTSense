       Where for art thou pissface?    Rest assured, this entry has nothing to do with Romeo and Juliet or anything about a human pissface.  Once again the band finds itself ready to compete against approximately 160 other local acts in this year's Battle of the Bands.  I've always been torn about these things. On one hand I ask myself "Why would any band want to compete against another band? What is there to prove?" On the other hand I say to myself "Because you dipshit. There is $10,000 at stake, a touring van, and a whole lot of FUCK YOU's to be said to the other bands if you win." Of course the "Fuck You!" part is barring you aren't a band we like. There are only a few so chances are your not one of them. Sorry. Our band has always struggled with promotion. I don't mean flyering around town, I mean sucking up to the appropriate figure heads. We just don't do it. I'm sure we come across as dicks because of it, but I swear that's not the case. Well, maybe that's not entirely true.  If you are in a band you are in a band because: A. You like the music you play. B. You want as many people as possible to hear the music that you love (punk rock in our case). C. You want to make money at what you are doing. Don't give me this "It's punk rock motherfucker!" You need the money. Whether it is to buy alcohol, crack, heroine or to feed the baby you just had with your 17 year old girlfriend. You do it because you hope someday you'll be making money from it. There is NOTHING wrong with that. Just make sure that's not the only reason you're doing it.  It can be argued, and it's generally agreed on, that if one wants to make it "big" he'she has to be a salesman of their product. i.e. music. But, there are limits to what our band will do in order to get people to hear our shit. I REFUSE to walk up to any journalists, introduce myself and tell him/her how great I think his columns are. Nope, not gonna do it. I WILL however hand them a demo or invite them to a show. If they come, great. If not, I'll try it a couple more times. It doesn't take much to realize when a journalist gives a flying fuck about your band or not. If they don't show up after two or three show offers than chances are they won't show up at all. Wait, that's not entirely true. Some journalists will get off their lazy asses if you bug the shit out of them enough. So forget what I just said, and bug the fuck out of every journalist you come across.  Anyway, sucking up isn't in our repetoire (sp?). I do now of some people around town that have no problem doing it, and the bands they promote are usually the ones who get the most press. That's why we rely on our on-stage "Fuck you, what you see is what you get" attitude. We rely on the 20 to 25 minute blitzkrieg set filled with energy. We cannot allow the crowd enough time to think or else they'll come to the conclusion that "Hey, this band really doesn't give a fuck what I like!" When the audience has time to think or process what we just said (Or lack thereof in our case) it's bad news for us. Let them think AFTER the show, not during. Hit 'em hard and keep hitting them hard for a good 20 to 25 minutes non-stop. Many people will argue this point but they are wrong. Always, I repeat, ALWAYS leave the crowd wanting more. I don't care how good of a band you are. You are LOCAL and people will probably get bored with you after about 15 minutes of the same crap over and over. Unless your pulling monkees out of your ass (And yes, I spelled it M O N K E E S because you'll have to pull Mickey fucking Dolenz out of your ass in order to keep the crowds attention for more than 15 minutes) the crowd will start to think about other shit. That's all.

       PUH PUH PUH Please pass the punk rock thank you very little...    Clever huh? Nothing like listening to some Social Distortion ("Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell" at the moment) on the eve of what could and should be a great local punk rock show. We're playing tommorow night with some great bands like Wasteland D.C. whom bring a more old-school hardcore sound, Saltwater Vampires who are more of the Screeching Weasel-style of pop-punk (very good I might add) and a band I've never seen or heard but have heard good things about in City Water Bandits.  It's fucked up really. This month is our two year anniversary of our Punk Rock Night debut, which marked the start of a strech of time when things were really going well for us locally. People liked us, or seemed to have liked us. I know the kids liked us, but I think the older crowd just thought we were a cute punk rock band during a time when not many kids our age were playing the style of punk rock we played. It was only two fucking years ago but now in many ways we've been forgotten by those same older people, and some of the younger kids who have grown up and gone on to other things. There are many more punk bands of different varities these days around Indy so it's almost like we're a dime a dozen. Although the minute I start thinking that I quickly take a look at our influences and our sound and I can't really put a finger on any other local band that we sound like or quite sounds like us. We aren't hardcore, we aren't street or oi and we aren't pop. I guess we have a unique sound, often compared to that of the Ramones, yet not as poppy.  In the three years this band has been together we've been in the spotlight locally, somewhat forgotten, and almost re-discovered ourselves as of recently. And really, we never went away. Jonny and I refuse to let this thing die. The minute I start thinking it's time to end (and I have many many times) something in me takes over and says to keep going, you've come this far. Three years is a long time for a local punk band...hell, ANY BAND...to stay together. I hear of great local bands coming and going all the time, yet when our time comes and it's time to split, will people remember us? If they do, if they remember ANYTHING, I hope it's that we were a group of kids who loved punk rock and didn't give a rats ass what anybody thought about us. Did we or do we want to be liked? Of course. But most important to myself, Jonny and Matt is that WE like the shit we write. If you like it, we greatly appreciate it and thank you for spending your hard earned money on a 30 minute set with us.  Our lineup has changed, but the core has always stayed the same. Our music has changed a bit, but in general it's always been somewhat in the ballpark of what we were trying to achieve soundwise. Still, I'm not completely satisfied with what we've done in the past (sound wise and god knows our first album was a piece of shit...thanks again Jim!) or where we are now, however I do think we are headed in the right direction. Jonny and I are stubborn bastards. We know what we like (him more-so than me) and we are very hard to work with. Just ask TJ, Matt, Zack and Kyle, all former members (Matt being now BACK in the band for a third time). People don't always seem to understand why we go through members like we do. I think it's because Jon and I are THAT hard to work with and we strive for perfection, even though we know that based on our talent levels we probably aren't going to achieve it very often in our lifetime. Yeah, it's something that him and I need to work on a bit, I would say myself more-so than him.  So I'm starting to rant, and finding it difficult to figure where exactly I'm going with this and really, who the hell is even going to read this? The minute this shit starts to sound like a "Dear Diary" I'm stopping. If you do find yourself reading this, I'm not going to thank you or anything. In fact, I pity you! You fool, have you nothing better to do than to read my fucking "blog?" OK, it's stop time now.

       Welcome to Sucksville: Home of pointless ranting and sometimes interesting comments made by me; Mikey Hooligan.    So this is it. I finally gave in to the new phenomenon that is a "blog." I feel dirty, I feel cheap, and yeah, kind of like a sellout. I hate everything a blog stands for, and more importantly, I hate the fact that it's a trend that I just gave in to. Whatever, you can just fuck off if you don't want to be here, no skin off my balls. If you care, I'll try to update this bad boy daily, weekly, whatever. It's what I feel like doing at the time being, and let me tell you something, I'm not a very motivated person.  Should I tell you a bit about myself? Sure, why not. My name is Mike, I play drums in an Indianapolis-based punk rock band called The Sucks, formerly the Hooligans. I'm a cranky SOB, if you have not been able to tell already. I'll try to keep things on this blog...jesus I hate referring to it as that...somewhat interesting. It all depends on my mood, which I will completely let dictate what goes in this damned thing. However, I won't bore you to death with stupid shit like what I bought at the grocery store today or how my fiance dumped me (she didn't).

        It's baseball season fools!   That's right, it's time for another season of America's favorite pastime. There's nothing better than the first couple of weeks of the baseball season. Personally, it's a chance for me to follow my favorite team, the Minnesota Twins, who happen to be banged up as all hell right now yet still playing decent enough ball to be a game over .500.  I also happen to play semi-professional ball for the Indianapolis Red Sox which means another season of me hitting .275 with 12 RBI's and no homeruns. Actually, I'm going deep this year. I swear it. Don't believe me? Then bug me about getting a schedule and check out one of our games. Hey, you can't beat free baseball played by decent athletes who actually LOVE the game for reasons other than money. Actually, I can't question the motives of the professional athletes who play Major League Baseball. Hell, who wouldn't accept a multi-million dollar contract to play a game you love?   Anyway, back to the task at hand. The Twins are all fucked up this year. It's still early in the season so players have plenty of time to heal. The biggest question mark right now is their rookie catcher Joe Mauer. Joe is a 20 year old phenom who grew up in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, so he's a hometown boy. He fucked up his knee during the second game of the season while attempting to catch a foul ball. See Joe slid on the Metrodomes rubber warning track surface in an attempt to get to the ball. His shin/knee pads stuck to the rubber surface, caught his knee, and low and behold the guy has some ligament damage they have to repair. It's a good thing he's so young and this happened now rather than later in the season or his career. However, it's still very scary considering he's a catcher and he squats all nine innings.  To add insult to injury, Torii Hunter is on the 15 day DL with a pulled Hamstring, and Doug Meintkeweitz sprained his anke last night. No word on how many games, if any, he'll miss.   Still, the Twinkies are playing good enough to be a game over the .500 mark early in the season. They took a 3-game series from a red hot Detroit team and recently beat an improved Cleveland team. I'm not too worried about the team. This is an organization who have overcome a shitload of controversy in the past three years and they play with confidence despite the obstacles. Take a look at last year's slow start. No worries from this Twins fan, not yet at least.  Tonight I have plans to check out an Indianapolis Indians game and look forward to lots of cheap hotdogs and beer. For those of you not in the know, the Indians are a AAA team here in Indy affiliated with the Brewers (unfortunately). They play in an amazing stadium located in the heart of downtown Indy and the weather today is beautiful. This will be my first time attending an Indians game but not my first time at Victory Field. A few years ago the amateur team that I play on played actually played game at there. But our seats are on the third base side, a few rows up from the field so we are in some serios fould ball territory. I'm quite looking forward to the game.

       It's a "block" party and you're invited.   Do you ever feel like you are about to have a panic attack? That's about how I feel right now. My palms feel sweaty, my head hurts, I can't focus on what I'm doing and I feel like I can hardly breathe.   You see, right now I'm stuck in a place where I can't really tell anyone how I'm feeling. I'm stuck at work, staring at a fucking computer screen and ready to pull my fucking hair out. I feel like at any moment I could just walk away from everything.   How did I get to this point? Well, my job assignment was to create some copy for a poster that will advertise a statewide high school art competition. I did, and it was decent enough. It wasn't anything great (actually, I can't help but feel like NOTHING i'm writing lately has been that great) but it was good enough to send to the "big chair" and get approval on it. Turns out he thought it was good, but it was too long. What he failed to tell me before I wrote the fucking thing was that he wanted something one to two sentences. He didn't want copy, he wanted a fucking tag line.   Anyway, I've been struggling with this for days. I have the worst case of writers block and I'm ready to just say "fuck this!" I'm still in school (one year left) and I intern at the agency every day on top of my studies. I'm burnt out as they say. Too much heavy thinking. Sure, it could be worse. But the longer they keep my on as an intern (almost one year now) the more complicated my duties have become. It's a GREAT resume builder and I can't thank them enough, but I'm at the point where I need to drop one or the other and it won't be school. It's not like I take one class and then work the rest of the week. No. This fall I'll be taking four classes (full time) on top of my duties at the agency. As much as I appreciate them wanting me to stay I'm not so sure that's what I want. By the way, writing this is good for me. It helps me get back into the flow and break that great barrier that is writers block.   Anyway, I have to admit that I'm feeling a bit better now. If they don't like the tags that I wrote for the poster then they'll tell me. I won't lie. I'll just tell them I had a serious case of writers block and that I agree, it wasn't the best work I've done. If you take writing as seriously as I do you know that writers block happens to the best of 'em.    urlLink Here  is a link that will send you to some copy that I wrote. It will give you an idea of what exactly it is that I do. This is the art competition I was talking about.

       Ants at work, ants at work.   Dear God! It's been a while since I've updated this thing hasn't it? Life's been busy I guess but mostly I just haven't really felt like writing all that much. The man has got me down I tell ya, the man has got me down!  Anyway, in case you've: a.) been living under a rock b.) don't give a rats ass c.) aren't a real friend of mine you should know that the band is no longer. Jon and I decided it was time to take a break. A long break. A break that could last forever. Matt told us some time ago that he didn't want to play with us anymore. He was basically sick of playing punk rock and he had plans to do something on his own accord. After the initial frustration of Matt's announcement Jon and I decided that maybe Matt leaving is a blessing in disguise. To get you up to speed, we've basically been doing the band thing at least once a week for the past three and a half years or so. That's a lot of time devoted to playing the same songs over and over again and after a while you get REALLY burned out. Matt's timing wasn't exactly the greatest but it never is when someone leaves the band. At that point, we had plans to record an album and had an out of town show in Chicago already booked. Jon and I have massive balls though and we still ended up playing as a two piece. It was incredible...incredibley shitty that is. Oh well, our balls are still huge.   Despite being one man short Jon and I still decided that we wanted to record the album. Jon ended up laying ALL of the guitar down by himself. Keep in mind this kid is NOT a lead guitarist. I really haven't heard the end result yet but Jon did what he could and it worked. Listen, our songs aren't complicated. My guess is that a monkey could fuckin' play some of them. Actually, if you consider TJ a monkey then you could say one actually has (oh, TJ is an old guitarist of ours. Pardon the reference if you didn't know that). But really, I think the end result will be pretty decent. Hey, we're giving the damn things away for free so no complaining, got it?!   On to the marriage front (I was engaged last July 17th to Diane, my girlfriend of over four years). Things are progressing quite nicely. We are currently in the midst of choosing a site for our rehearsal dinner. Our budget is tight but we've managed to narrow it down to a couple of fine restaurants. Let me just say it; planning a wedding is a bitch and I don't recommend it to ANYONE. Get married in Las Vegas if you can, and really just avoid marriage altogether if you can manage. Actually, I take that back. Getting married is a wonderful thing. It's the planning of the wedding that sucks (I had to save my ass on that one).    That's about all I feel like writing right now. I'm bored and I think I'm a bit crabby. Oh, one last thing. My brother Jon joined the Army. This angers me. I wanted to join the Army too. Oh well, good luck Jon. I'm sure you read this.  Oh yeah, the title of this post is a reference to a little problem we had at work today.  urlLink Ants . Little tiny ones, running all over the kitchen counter. Stupid things.   P.S. (It's the last one, I swear) I just read an earlier post of mine. After writing in  this  post that the band broke up and then reading  that  post that said some things about never wanting to break up I can officially claim that I am indeed a dumbass and should never have said those things. Oh well, I must not have knocked on wood or some shit. Shit happens I guess!
