      Today at work, I decided to challenge the guy I was working with to a duel with rolled up movie posters.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was board.&nbsp; and it seemed like fun.&nbsp; The only rule was no head hits.&nbsp; once we started the duel, I was screwed.&nbsp; I got whooped up on.&nbsp; just as a I was stabbing back at him (unsuccessfully do to my shorter arms) he stabs me in the face.&nbsp; Right to the right of my nose.&nbsp; It hurt and we i looked in the mirror, there was a little cut.&nbsp; i called the duel there.&nbsp; It was the most fun i have had at work, up to where i got hit in the face.&nbsp; Good times.

      For the last few days, I have been trying to sleep in past noon, but have been failing untill today.&nbsp; It seem I keep tricking myself into thinking it is a lot later in the day than it is.&nbsp; I keep waking up at 9:30 or 10:30 and thinking I actually slept in till noon.&nbsp; I am am early riser so I rarely make it past 11 on any given day.&nbsp; I did wake up at 9:30 toady, then i put on some music, and fell back to sleep till 12:30.&nbsp; I am so proud of myself.&nbsp; The thing that sucks about this is that I stayed up till 2:30 watching a movie and I am gonna be up all night tonight, then I have to get up at 7:30 tommorow to go to church.&nbsp; Oh well, it was worth it.

      Today, i was at my usual crappy job renting movies, when i caught a glance of this chick walking past our side door that was open cuz it was hot.&nbsp; I onlt saw her for a second, but i could tell she was a babe.&nbsp; Then like 30 minutes later, she comes in and asked for a movie, i get it, then rent it.&nbsp; Now this babe looked like the girl from the movie final destination.&nbsp; she was real cute, but maybe a year older than me, i'm not sure.&nbsp; I kept thinking I should ask her out on a date, just for the&nbsp;heck of it and because, like i said, she was a babe.&nbsp; Well, i wussed out and didn't but i regret not doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;its something i&nbsp;always wanted to do at work.&nbsp; &nbsp;even if she laughs at me, at least i tried and i would probably never see her again anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh well, i guesse i will get the next hot girl who comes in.&nbsp; sigh....

      This november is election time.&nbsp; I think i am gonna vote Kerry and Edwards.&nbsp; I like Kerry becuase he is not bush.&nbsp; I like Edwards becuase he is for the working man.&nbsp; The thing that really bugs me about them is both of their names are John.&nbsp; That is gonna drive me nuts.&nbsp; Does that bother anyone else?

      Here are some movies i am dying to see. 1-&nbsp; The Village:&nbsp; M. Night shamalon Rules all suspense and this looks like a good movie on top of his great record. 2- Harold and Kumar go to White Castle:&nbsp; just plain funny looking.&nbsp; getting compared to dude, wheres my car and bill and teds excellent adventure. 3- The Bourne Supremacy:&nbsp; i loved the first one, and this should rock even more.  4- Collateral:&nbsp; its tom cruise being evil, i think its gonna be really good.&nbsp; i am a little unsure though. 5- Open Water:&nbsp; looks like an intense suspense, great plot and based on a true story. 6- Alien V. Predator:&nbsp; Two of the best monsters face off.&nbsp; can't wait.&nbsp; it will either be awsome or suck 7- Princess Diares 2:&nbsp; gotcha! 8- Danny Deckchair:&nbsp; this is the classic urban legend on the big screen.&nbsp; i am very curious. &nbsp; thats all for now, friends, till next time.&nbsp; stay classy san diego.

      I love to listen to music and a few music realated thought came to my brain today. 1: &nbsp;stairway to heaven is the best song ever.&nbsp; i was not into it at first, but the more you listen to it, the better it gets.&nbsp; trust me.&nbsp; just play it on repeat and you see how unique it is. 2:&nbsp; i must buy the postal service cd.&nbsp; i love their new song called something like "we will all become silloulettes"&nbsp; listen to 1077.7 the ends peoples choice countdown, it was like 7 tonight.&nbsp; The PCC is on at 9. i think i will buy that cd at QS, i got a free 20$ down there. 3:&nbsp; avril lavine actually has a song i like.&nbsp; i don't know the title, but it is her most recent one.&nbsp; i really like it overall.&nbsp; i usually think her songs are sucky, but this one is well done.&nbsp; i should burn it.&nbsp; EVIL TIM!. 4:&nbsp; weezer is one of the best bands ever!&nbsp; i got in a funk where i did not want to listen to them, then i forced myself to and THEY ROCK!&nbsp; i recomend them to all who want pure good rock.&nbsp; I think Matt would like it, esp their 2nd cd pinkerton.&nbsp; i'll burn any cd for anyone, just let me know. 5:&nbsp; i need to learn how to play guitar.&nbsp; thats next years summer goal. 6:&nbsp; i will only by cds, now, no dvds cuz i get a lot more enjoyment out of cds.&nbsp; dvds i watch once and never watch again.&nbsp; cds are also cheaper which is good since i will be unemployed. &nbsp; Thats all my music thoughts of the day.&nbsp; stay classy san diego.

      Today i saw anchorman with will ferral today in silverdale.&nbsp; i went with my friend jonathon.&nbsp; it was really really funny.&nbsp; there is no plot at all, but i really enjoyed watching it.&nbsp; just palin stupid fun.&nbsp; the funniest person was not will ferral, but the retarded anchorman who would say the most random stuff.&nbsp; he was halarious.&nbsp; so my verdict is to&nbsp;go see it and keep your expectations low.&nbsp; let me know what you think of it.&nbsp; stay classy san deigo.

      Well, like i said earlier, i was gonna go to silverdale and that i did.  I went with justin brahm and andy.  we went bowling.  Brahm drove and he is a good driver, i was afraid he would suck, but i got to hand it to him.  he did lock down the windows which bugged me esp when i got cold.  we also hit a lot of construction cuz we left at like 8 pm and hit all the late night construction.  we still had fun just making fun of eachother.  so once in silverdale, andy wanted to see a movie, but we overruled him and went bowling.  bowling was fun, i lost a lot (2 of 3 games) but i get better, so i like it.  i almost broke 100, but got 95.  after bowling we went to an arcade and played dance dance revolution which is a lot harder than it looks, but it would be fun to practice a lot.  then we drove around silverdale looking for food and ended up going to wendy's.  then we drove home.  it was fun to hang out with andy and brahm cuz i never hang out with them much.  we do want to all go to gameworks for a day.  i am 50/50 on that ever happening. we shall see.  well that is all for now my friends, see ya next time.

      Hi this is my first post.  I am at home, hanging out with justin, my friend, and we are listening to Dave Attel (i'll burn you the cd if you want), a comedian while I work on my blog.  hopefully later my friends Andy and Brahm will call and we all will go to Silverdale to bowl or see a movie.  i would rather bowl. I'll let you know how that works out.  This is my first post and i know it sucks, but think... It will only get better. Adious friends.

      Today i have spent the last 4 hours watching the surreal life on VH1.&nbsp;&nbsp; its just your typical reality tv show but they got some b list celebrities that include vanilla ice.&nbsp; After watching him, i realized that is he a cool guy.&nbsp; he really dosen't like to be know as vanilla ice.&nbsp; he just wants to forget all about that.&nbsp; he has a wife and a kid and he is a pretty cool guy.&nbsp; i really respect him.&nbsp;&nbsp;like&nbsp;he got in a&nbsp;fight with&nbsp;this baywatch&nbsp;girl and after they&nbsp;yelled at each other for&nbsp;while, he stops and apoligizes.&nbsp; Just out of the blue,&nbsp;so i really got to&nbsp;give him props for being the bigger man.&nbsp; &nbsp;i will also not make fun of him, not that i did that much, but i won't if i were to.&nbsp;&nbsp; thats my thought on that.&nbsp; i guesse i will try not to make fun of celebrities too much cuz the're people too.&nbsp; i know i still will make fun of them, but i'll feel bad about it. thanks for listening.

      Well if you are keeping up on my blog, you know that i just quit my job renting movies last sunday.&nbsp; my boss wanted me to work a wekk in augest when some people are on vacation.&nbsp; i told her i would think about it.&nbsp; I also was thinking of going back to my old old job at an office doing office stuff.&nbsp; it would probably be for only a week.&nbsp; then today i was gonna work out at the local gym when my friend's mom who works there basically said i could work there if i wanted to.&nbsp; It would be less hours than my old job, really easy and more possibilites for a raise.&nbsp; still i am not sure to take it cuz i really wanted to go jobless for the rest of the summer, but it a sweet job to have cuz eventually i will have to get one. so i probably will take it.&nbsp; i need the spending money.&nbsp; i am addicted to buying cds and at 20$ a pop, i got to get some cashflow.&nbsp; thats todays news.&nbsp; Adious

      This is like my 3rd post in like so many minutes, but I am on a roll.&nbsp; On Thursday, this girl i have been hanging out with whom i also really like is coming back from a month in California.&nbsp; I'm pretty excited and i want to ask her to go to the drive in with me this weekend.&nbsp; I am thinking of asking her out.&nbsp; she knows i like her becuase i told her so right before she left, but that is as far as our relationship is in that dirrection. I can't wait to see her.&nbsp; after not seeing her for a month, i relized how much i missed her.&nbsp; Also, watching some movie recently made me want to snatch her up for myself before someone eles does, so i am gonna try.&nbsp;&nbsp; thats just been on my mind. i'll let ya all know how that works out.

      Hola friends.&nbsp; Today I went to a Mariners game.&nbsp; I went with my friend Jonathon.&nbsp; We almost missed the ferry cuz we wanted to park at bainbridge and walk across like we usually do.&nbsp; I had it timed that if we left my house and went driectly to the ferry dock, we would have been there on time to catch the 11:30 boat, but he had to stop by work and the bank (both of which he could have done before he picked me up).&nbsp; This and his lateness in picking me up prevented us from getting to the ferry dock on time to catch the boat I figured us on getting.&nbsp; Then we couldn't find a spot to park and my suggestion of going over to a little parking lot was dismissed untill he finally concided in looking at it.&nbsp; They were a bunch of open spots, so we paid for parking and made the 12:20 bat with 2 minutes to spare.&nbsp; it was a close call. luckly it worked out (I was somewhat annoyed with him)&nbsp; At the m's game.&nbsp; I had a good time.&nbsp; Jonathon is a nice guy, but he is so enbedded with his own views of politics and just reality that he doesn't concide when he is wrong, so its hard for me to have a discussion with him.&nbsp; If i'm wrong, I'll concide my wrongness, then he will jump on that and kinda reason that everything eles I was saying is also wrong.&nbsp; He is very much a politician in that he is never wrong nor is there any faults with himself.&nbsp; It can be annoying to be around him for very long.&nbsp; Still he is&nbsp;a good friend.&nbsp;&nbsp; But anyway, i just wanted to get that off my chest.&nbsp; We had awsome seats for the M's game, Left feild, fair territory, and 4 rows back.&nbsp; They were like perfect home run seats, but sadly none came to us.&nbsp; Still they were the best seats I have ever had for a M's Game.&nbsp; The M's lost,but should have won.&nbsp; they kept getting hits, but no runs.&nbsp; Oh, I ate a bunch of licorice there.&nbsp; I have been off sweets and junk food all month, but I gave in just for today and it was amazing how good the licorice tasted.&nbsp; if want a recap of the game i went to check it out  urlLink here .&nbsp; any who thats that.&nbsp; peace.

      Ok here is the bored post.&nbsp; Just about every blog I read has one and here is mine.&nbsp; I'm at home listening to 1077 the end.&nbsp; humm..... Just the other night I realized there was a spell check on this thing that I never use.&nbsp; hopefully I remember to use it cuz unless I try hard, my grammar is horrible.&nbsp; humm I went downtown today.&nbsp; it was really busy even on a Monday.&nbsp; hard to find a spot to park.&nbsp; then I saw some girls I knew including one I used to really like and hadn't spoke to&nbsp;in a few years.&nbsp; luckily I was wearing sunglasses so I looked cool.&nbsp; at the local record store, they did not have the postal service single I ordered yet, but they said maybe tomorrow.&nbsp; I also went to pizza factory to drop off a CD&nbsp;to a guy there that I was borrowing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also stopped off at work and gave them my keys.&nbsp; then my boss has all these questions for me about late charges an I really didn't care about&nbsp;cues it was not my problem anyone.&nbsp; I think I will avoid going there when my boss is around from now on.&nbsp; then trying to get gas today was crazy cues all the pumps were used to I had to circle around till a spot opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; that's all for now.&nbsp; justin was suppose to stop by here and we would hang out but that was like 3 hours ago.&nbsp; I might make lunch then call him up.&nbsp; perhaps I shall make my own pizza.&nbsp; lol, now I am talking ot matt and I can't remember the difference between board and bored.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guesse I got to stop writing.

      hola friends, right now i am pretty freakin happy.  I was just talking to this girl who is basically best friends with the girl i just relized i liked.  i asked her why me and this othe girl never worked out and basically it is cuz i never really talked to her, which is 100% true.  i was shy and didn't say much to her even though we went to one dance and on a date.  i think i mention all that in my last post.  well anywho marie basically told me the same thing.  so now i know where i failed and i think i am over my shyness and that i am ready to give our relationship another try, i still need to call her, but now that i know that i have a chance, well i can do anything.  so i am estatic over all that.  i feel i have really matured since i first liked her, and i am really ready to get to know her better.   since i last talked to her, i was kinda divided on her and this other girl, whom i speak of ealier that i liked.  but now she has my full attention so i am ready to really commit to her.    thats that, i'll let ya all know when i call her.  (the situation has upgraded from "if i call her" to "when i call her") in todays news, i spend all day in whidbey with marie and justin.  it was really fun, marie is super cool and its hard to remember that i have only met her twice (ya hear that marie?  you rule!)  i had crepes which i pronouce creeps.  then we went downtown and then we went to the movies and say i, robot.  which was pretty good.  the ferry ride home was late 30 min.  then i got a parking ticket warning for parking all day in two hour parking.  whoops!  still alls well that ends well.  thats all friends, till next time.  peace.

      alrighty friends, heres whats happened since we last talked.  yesterday i spent all day with maya, the girl i like.  we went around downtown and to fort worden, then we got lost which was really fun.   then we rented vegas vaction was is a really funny movie.  i was thinking about asking her out, but then i wussed out.  then when i got home and talked to marie, i relized that i still liked this other girl whom i went on a date with and to a dance with, but i really haven't talked to her much since, but marie gave some advice and now i think i am gonna try to hang out with her soon, but i still got to muster up the courage.  also that night, i was so messed up in the head, i was like all over the place emotionaly.  tired, hyper, angry, sad, happy.  so i watch some conan, then i had a bowl of cereal and two yogets.  not my best moment, i just went on a food benge at 12:30.  so anyway today, a new day, i go to see the village and harold and kumar go to white castle with my friend justin.  both we good decent movies with the village being better.  H&K was good, but nothing special, so i can't fully reconmend it.  village was weird, but good.  very twlight zone-ish.  then i am here tonight.  i talked with my brothers friend who is going to college to be a history teacher which is what i really want to do, and so he said that the papers in college were not too bad, and that was what i was worried about, so now i am all ready for college.  anyway, i am gonna hang out with marie tommorow, so i am looking forword to that.  it never occured to me that i could go to whidbey, and its cool to have a place so close that i have never been to.  i'm hyped.  thats about all friends.  thanks for listening.  oh i just want to mention that the song "du hast" is such a friggin amazing song,  i was headbanging to it for about 10 minutes straight. my neck hurt afterwords.  thats song is genius.  i just wanted to say that.

      well today i hung out with maya, we got lost which was pretty friggin awsome.&nbsp; then we did other stuff but i am too lazy to write it all.&nbsp; i like maya, but i got this other girl i keep thinking about. i should call her, but i am not sure if she likes me.&nbsp; we went one a date and a dance togeather, but i really never talked to her again much, but i am thinking i should.&nbsp;&nbsp; marie gave me some good advice, so i think i might have a chance.&nbsp; anywho me and marie are working out a plan for me to vist her in whidbey, so that will be awsome.&nbsp; i think i need to leave PT and silverdale does not count.&nbsp; i just need to do something new and get away for a while, so this seems like the perfect solution.&nbsp; anywho, thanks for reading.

      Alrighy friends, its been about 48 hours since i last blogged which is the longest i have gone since i started this, but i have been way to busy so i'll just update you on what i have been doing.&nbsp; well monday, i was suppose to hang out with the girl i like, maya, but she slept in till 2 and did not call me till 4, which is surprising cuz she usually gets up at like 8, but she had a good reason, so i am not complaning or nothing, so anywho, when she did call me, she had to do sometihng that night. and i had stuff to do, so we agreed to hang out thursday.&nbsp; she told me to call her when i get up, which i love, i guesse i liek to know that my whole day will be with her.&nbsp; so then what could i do to salvage a monday, i go to my friend andy's house and we hang out for a while playing games, watching tv, then we decide to go bowling and we get matt and brahm to go, i drove.&nbsp;&nbsp; when we get there i wear my sunglasses the whole time which i think makes me pretty cool, but then again i probably looked stupid wearing sunglasses in a bowling alley.&nbsp; i did bowl over 100 which is always my goal, then i went to the arcade afterword and got a little dude with the claw game, but i hated what i got, so it ended up outside my friend andy's house on the street, haha.&nbsp; then i went home, i was tired, then tuesday i got up and found found my friends colin and cody walking from the rec center and i intercept them, pick them up and we go to silverdale to see the bourne&nbsp;sprmacy which was kinda a dissapointment because the story was hard to follow and the camera during the action was too bouncy, so i lost a lot of the movie, but i need to see it again, i think i could like it a lot more if i saw it again.&nbsp; so then i get home and then go to steves, the same steve fro before, i am still stepping in as a friend but i think we could be good friends in the future.&nbsp; we basically spent 9 hours trying to get a game to work that we ended up playing for 30 minutes, so it was a waste espcialyl since the people i played online were jerks, but i think me and steve got a good understanding of each other and we can be good friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; we ended up going ot bed at 4 in the morning, which is the latest i have been up all night this summer, i think i am gonna try to stay up all night sometime.&nbsp; then we got up at 8 cuz he had drivers ed, then i went home and slept for another 4 hours, then i got up&nbsp;burned some cds and went downtown, visted my old work, went to the bank, then i met marie and hung out with her and matt all afternoon and had a blast.&nbsp; hopefully i will be able to go to whidbey to check out maries stomping ground (ya hear that marie?).&nbsp; then i ran home to get my poker game set up.&nbsp; there were 6 of us there and i ended up the big loser, and i am thinking i will save my money for the casino in a month, i get frustrated losing to my friends.&nbsp; still it was a good time had by all, so it was a success, justin now wants to host a game at his house, i think this could be a fun thing to start doing.&nbsp; btw, i met this new guy named RJ who played poker with us.&nbsp; he was a cool guy and i think i'll hang out with him more this summer.&nbsp; here in pt, its not too often to met a new friend, its basically the same group of friends so i am glad for someone new to hang out with.&nbsp; like i said i was angry from losing, i think i lost like 10$ but it might be more.&nbsp; i would have rather gone bowling, but again i lost so anything would have been better.&nbsp;&nbsp; so now i am here now, and the last 72 hours have been pretty eventful for me, i mean i usually go to the movies one day, then i sleep and hang out on the computer the next, so 3 days of stuff happening has really got&nbsp;me worn out on friends.&nbsp; not to sound like an unfriendly guy, but i like to have some space.&nbsp; i guesse that is the serial killer part of me (if ya don't know about that ask me, i'm not an actual serial killer).&nbsp; i guesse i get burned out pretty easy, i feel like i am putting on a show where i have to be attentive and stuff, i just need to get away from it all for a while.&nbsp; i need to relax, take it easy.&nbsp; tommorow i am hanging out with maya which will either make me more tired and burnned out or it will have the oppisite affect, but i guesse i will have to see.&nbsp;&nbsp; now for my final thought, i was pretty mad about losing at poker my 10$, but when i got online afterwords and talked to my friend steve, i was informed that while i was at his house, someone broke into his mom's unlocked car and stole some cds while my car was next to it, it probably happened while we were up too.&nbsp; my car was ok because i had locked the doors like i always do.&nbsp; had i not, someone would have broken into my car and stole my cds which might mean more to me than anything, so putting that in perspective i relize that losing my 10$ was nothing and that i should be thankful just to still have my cds.&nbsp; i think i eventually have to burn all my cds copies just to have back ups cuz i think eventally someone will steal them.&nbsp; thats all friends.&nbsp;

      Humm i am in the mood to write something to ya all.&nbsp; well i guesse the most interesting thing to happen to me in the last 24 hours was that i went over to this guys house where him and his friend got drunk. i didn't drink just cuz i never have and i'm too much of a square to start.&nbsp; this friend of mine, we will call him steve, just like had some big explosiion with his friends so he is kinda bummed out so i was like stepping in as a friend, we never have hung out before this.&nbsp; so any way yesterday him and my friend colin go play some pool, then later i'm on msn and he needs a ride to his friends house with whom he is having some sort of friend trouble.&nbsp; on the way he says i can hang out with him and his friend at his house.&nbsp; he explains that there will be some alcohol.&nbsp; i'm kinda nervous at this and explain that i'll hang out, but i don't want to drink.&nbsp; so once i dropp him off at his friends, i go home and he calls me a few hours later to come to&nbsp;his house to hang out, which i do.&nbsp; his other friend is a homeschooler (WEIRDOS! ALL OF THEM!), and this other girl comes over, but she is really tired and mellow.&nbsp; so anywho i'm on msn messenger while him and his other friends are doing something on the other computer and feeling really out of the loop, but then me and steve and the other guy go to safeway to get some food at like 11:30.&nbsp; that was fun.&nbsp; then we come back and steve and his buddy drink a jarful (yes it was in jar) of something, i think gin.&nbsp; i'm offered some then decline.&nbsp; so anywho, we decide to watch an episode of red dwarf. by this time steve is pretty much tipsy.&nbsp; so then i'm pretty tired and go home at about 1.&nbsp; it was kinda&nbsp;an alright experience for my first alchole situation.&nbsp; i think i won't drink in the future, but now i know it ok to say no.&nbsp; so thats that.&nbsp; i just wanted to write it all down.&nbsp; thanks for listening.

      Well today I went and saw "napoleon Dynomite" with justin, paul, and timmy.  Timmy and paul are some guys we ment at this government camp this summer who live in paulsbo.  the movie was awsome and justin smuggled in a ton of popcorn, it was sooooo funny.  we now call him backpack.  hopefully he will explain all that better on his blog.  it was fun.  then when I got home, i thought i would call the girl i like just to see if her phone worked, and it totally caught me off guard when it did and my first reaction was to hang up (i'm a dork like that), then i got a handle on things and when someone did pick up, i asked to speak to her, then they asked who i was, and said tim and for some weird reason, people on the phone can't hear me when i say tim, so their like who?  and i'm like tim, and then they hand the phone to someone eles and i'm like "can i speak to so and so", then i go through the same thing again.  most frustrating. so when i did talk to her, she was surprised to hear from me which i can't blame her, just cuz i called out of the blue after not seeing her since school.  we talk for a sec, and she says she will call me later cuz she has a friend over.  overall, i think she was glad to hear from me, but that might just be my spin on it.  so i think i got a good shot.  she never did call me back tonight, but i figure her friend is spending the night there and she will call me back tommorow. thats my theory anyway.  if she doesn't, well i am lost without an idea what to do, but i won't think about that.   so i think things are on the right track.  hopefully she does call me.  fingers crossed.  thats all for now.

      Hi friends.  whats new in my life?   its been a while since I have last blogged, so here goes.   I've been reading "the flight of the pheonix" which is a good book, but I am looking forword to finishing it just so I can start something eles.  I've got a billion books I want to read, which is nice because usually I have trouble finding interesting things to read.  I saw collerateral yesterday with some friends.  Its a great movie, go see it.  I cleaned my car and now it seems like febreeze.  oh well, i will drive with the windows down a lot, not that I didn't already.   I got a game yesterday in silverdale, that really sucks, so now I will not buy video games for... well untill I convince myself that it is ok.  I already banned myself from buying dvds, so this is not gonna be that hard.   I will just buy cds.  speaking of cd's.  I am only buying them from the local record store now because for every 200 you spend you get 20 back.  now that i think about it, I must have done that 3 times meaning I have spent 600, which is a lot, but its worth it.   there is this one cd i want to buy but you can only get it only, but it is cool cuz it takes old nintendo NES songs, and basically they are redone, its cool stuff i dl'ed some.   Yesterday this computer got a virus and i was worried cuz its a trojan horse and my one friend who is computer smart said that those can mess up a computer and my dad does a lot of his work on this computer so I basically told my parents all this and my dad was pretty mellow with it, but now my mom is thinking we need a new computer.  my mom is dumb just that she knows nothing on computers, but she thinks she does.  it took care of the virus, turns out it was a tiny one that was contained quickly, so all is good.  I'm kinda feeling bad because there are a whole bunch of my friends that I have not been hanging out with just because I am busy, or lazy.  like there is this new guy RJ, who i saw downtown the other day, and he is new, so I want to hang out with him just so he has a friend here, but i have been hanging out with other people, so eventually I will have to call him, maybe monday.  theres some other people, i think i will dedicate next week to hanging out with those people.   thats the news here.  thanks for checking in here.

      ok well today kinda sucked.  did nothing and made a hugh skidmark that my dad is never gonna forgive me for.  i mean he won't be mean or nothing, but ever time he looks at it, he is gonna go "that dumb kid"  oh well.  anyhoo i am excited because of our illegal porn hook up.   jk lol.  sorry that was dirty.   anywho marie's example has got me wanting to go to a concert or something, so i went on 107.7 the end and my favorite all time singer/song writer/performer is gonna be at emp next week!  its art from everclear, so i am gonna go see him a week from sunday.  its gonna rock!  anyone want to go?  it would suck to go by myself, but if it comes down to it, i am gonna go.  i'm pumped!  humm i lost a bet to my mom about how far the middle school was to our house.  oh well she isn't gonna make me pay her becuase if she did, i would just borrow it back.  haha!

      ok so, i'm gonna skip my usual talk about where i am with the girl i like and what i have done today.  i'm gonna just go over a little overview of my life at this moment and where it is going.    this summer has gone really well for me.  i joined an gym and have been going for the last month.  i am not sure if i am stonger, but i feel better overall.  then i gave up all sweets and junkfood, which is my worst enemy.  i am a junkfood a holic.  but giving it all up, i feel better.  i eat 3 meals a day and if i do get a craving for something i eat carrots or drink water.   then i resolved to talk to the girl i like more than i have and to be more straight forword due to my last relationship that i am trying to salvage.  then i just decided today that i need to read more.  so i am doing that.  which will cut down on my tv watching which is bad for me.  so overall, i am feeling pretty good about myself and where i am going.  thats all friends.

      well lets see what is new in tim's world.   hummm worked out today and did some abs things on this machine.  i did 100 yesterday and 50 today and now whenever i laugh, i hurt.  its kinda sad, but then i luagh about the situation and then cry.  oh well.  I went bowling today.  bowled my bestest game ever, a 113.  so i am getting better.  had3 spares in a row.   also today i apoligized to justin for saying something dumb to him.  its kinda my new crusade to be more honest and let people know what i am thinking.  i actually like it.  i just say what i feel.   i kinda owe it to vanilla ice (see recent post).  tonight i spent probably an hour going though amazon.com to see what books i want to get.  i just feel like reading.   i just got a list to look at.  i am not gonna buy them, but go the library to see if they have them.  i don't have a job, otherwise i would buy them all.  i got 19 on the list ranging from sports, to short stories, to a true story on how some MIT kids screwed over blackjack (i need to learn this stuff when i go the casino), a book called "a short history on everything"  it seems cool, 1000 places you need to see before you die,  some other books which i don't quite know how to describe basically the purpose of life kinda things, a book on spiritual enlightenment.  quite a wide range.  i still have a few books laying aroudn that i need to read, but i can't force myself to pickthem up.  i got to read "the grapes of wrait" which i am looking forword to because i really liked "of mice and men"  that all the news i have for now.  btw i am listening to "sweet thing" by van morrison and i fully recommend it.  i'm not so much a fan of VM, but i really like that song.  peace all.

      ok have ya heard the song "do you relized" by the flaming lips?  i got that cd a long time ago and am just now really listening to it and i can't decide if i like that song or not.  its kinda annoyoing yet catchy.  its quite a conumdrum.  speaking of annoying situations, i was at my friends jonny's house and i was looking through a game magazine and there was this article about this cd that took old nintendo themes from games and made them songs, like remixes and i was gonna go to the website where they sell them and i forced myself to pay extra attention to the web address, but i forgot it, so now i think i will have to do some thinking, which is not going to go so well considering how out of it i feel, yet i must find that cd! The quest is on. GEEZE i just relized my watch is friggin nuts.  i was looking at it earlier and i thought i had broken the glass over the time, but i looked at it closly and it looked like it had dust on the inside which was weird, but now i just looked at it and it fine.  that so twlight zone!  well not really, but i live a dull life.   errrr! i feel tired, but i don't want to go to bed.  that is why this is rambling on and on and on and on, well you get the idea.   ohhh i forgot to mention what i am gonna do to my hair.  i wash gonna get a hockey cut pretty soon, but i watched this movie called "lucas" and it had charlie sheen in it and his hair was kinda cool, like in a buddy holly weezer kinda way.  retro if you will, so after i get bored of the hockey cut, i will get it cut again.  i think it will look cooler.  i want to wait till i see that girl i like though, just to seem interesting.  humm that sounds sad and pathetic, but hey who cares?!  whooohoooheeeheeeehahaaa!

      geeze, well i called this girl i like about an hour ago, just to try to set up a date and what do i get?  The friggin phone line is disconnected!  now the old tim would have percieved this to be a sign that i shouldn't ask her, but new tim is gonna roll with it,  that means i have to work a bit harder, but i'll figure something out.  i've got an idea, but i am not sure about it.  we'll see.  humm, other news?  i washed my car, after seeing marie's car, i just had to wash a car!  not only did i wash mine, i washed my brothers too.  PLEASE MARIE, LET ME WASH YOUR CAR!!!!  well thats my little car pet peve in addition to people who don't signal.   i swear that the more you wash, the easier it is.  i actually enjoy it.  its not a chore at all.  its like taking a shower, except you'r not naked, inside, and there is a car.  so basically the same thing.

      Wow, I really salvaged a day that could have been crappy.  I got up and had no plans.  I thought about going to this concert downtown, but didn't want to go alone.  So I was sitting around the house and decided to make my own pizza.  I got my mom to give me some money to go to the store.  While at the store, I debated getting a cart or just use a basket.  The cart was kind of gay, so I went to the basket.  Took me a while to find everything.  But I got it all.  Then I came home, ready to make some pizza, when my mom tells me my friends called me and wanted to play some pool.   I didn't really want to call them because I was in pizza mode, but decided to.  So end up playing some pool with my 2 friends and this neighbor kid who hung out with us, who is actually pretty cool.  We played some pool and pingpong.  Then we went to my friends house and we played some cards which was good times.  Then we played some scatagories and it turns out I rule at that.  Then we played some Taboo and my and the neighbor kid won, which was pretty cool.  Then we went home becuase my friend had to drive his mom to the store (she doesn't drive) but after that we hung out some more and did basically the same and palyed Yatzee too which is awsome becuase I love that game.  I won that too, but it was close.  Oh funny story.  When I was leaving to go home the first time, I was in my car waiting for my friend who I was going to give a ride home to, and my other friend was in his car next to mine in his driveway waiting for his mom.  We both had our windows down, so I threw some trash in his car, then threw this empty water bottle in his car.  So when he tries to throw it back, I roll up my windows, but the bottle gets lodge in between the window and the frame of the car.  It was funny because because the odds of that happening we slim.   Then I rolled down my windows again and he threw altoids at me and I threw this AOL demo disc at him and he threw it back.  By this time the friend I had to give a ride to was in the car and we were trying to hit my other friend, roll up the window, and get away.  It was pretty fun.  Yeah, so I never did make my pizza, but it was a fun day that started with no hope.  Thats about it, tommorow I am going to Seattle to a show at EMP.  I'm looking forword to it.   Thats it for now.  I tried to make my gammer and spelling and punctuation look good here.  I thought that since you guys take the effort to read this all, I should take the effort to make it as easy as possible for you all to read.   Thanks for reading.

      Alrighty, since everyone eles is taking the personality test, I might as well follow suit.  I took it twice actually and both times got the same thing.  you can look at my results under my little blerb about my profile to the right.  It says I am "trustee" which is true I would say.  No to be too modest (mouse!).   I would like to think over all, its saying I am the strong silent type, which is nice.  That isn't really exactly what it says, but that is my spin on it.  Thats that.  Bye friends.

      Alright well friends. another day, another blog.   Here is whats new in my life as if yesterday.  I kinda gave up on reading the grapes of wrait today and last night, but I got all month.   Since i was bolwing a lot lately, i looked on ebay from some bowling shoes, but after sleeping on it, that was dorky.  I'm back into my ebay obession.  Really, i just look just to have something to do.  Man, i hate to admit this, but i haven't taken a shower today and now i feel gross and i don't want to take one now cuz everyone is asleep... and my singing will keep them up.   i went to the county fair and i have been living in a world of illusion.  for some weird reason, i thought the fait was fun.  i was wrong, so very wrong.  only stayed for 20 minutes, before me and my friend found our other friend and went to play some pool.   worked out today, but i doubt i will tommorow.  just don't feel like it.  oh its weird how today is friday the 13th, i was like the only person to notice too.  i'm kinda superstitious, but just to make my life more interesting.  my gramps came in today, nice to see him.  hes a cool guy, but he always is like "don't fit too many girls into you car!"  and i humor him, but i wonder if he thinks i am some kinda of pimp or something.   i got my ticket for the art alexakis concert at emp this sunday.  i couldn't find anyone to go, but i didn't try that hard because i don't think my friends would be that interested if i took them along, but i think this will be good.  on my own in the big city.  there is a concert tommorow in town from 2-9.  kinda a local punk rock show.  i really don't know any bands there.  hopefully i will find a chica to go with me.   we'll see how that goes.   think i will wash my car tommorow.   watched x-men 2 today.  very good, makes me want to read the comics.  ironic how i make fun of my friend who reads comics.  then my friend and i were watching tva t my house and usually we go to his house, but today we were at mine and at his house, its ok to put your shoes on the couch and stuff, which is fine if you don't mind your couch getting dirty, but here, i really don't like doing that and he had his shoes on on our couch, and i wanted to say something, but didn't at the same time, so i let it slide.    something eles i would like to talk about.  eversince this last girl brushed me off, i really don't have any prospects, but i was thinking about this one thing this guy i worked with said, he said you don't have to like just one girl at a time which is how i go about things, so i am gonna try liking more than one girl at once.  now sure how it will work out, but it can't get any worst.  well i guesse that is all i have to say for tonight.  i wish i knew more people with blogs though.  adios.  ace

      alrighy, well today is a better than yesterday and a lot better than the day before.  i got up at 1:30, read some grapes of wrath, which is a really good book, but the problem with it is that my goal is to read 2 chapters when i wake up and 2 when i go to sleep, and the chapters can either be really long or really short, which sucks if you want to get up and you have to finish the next 6 pages.  but i am enjoying it.  i would say steinbeck if my favorite classic author, not my favorite author ever, but as mainstream books go, he is the man.  so after reading for like an hour, i get up and go to the gym.  worked out for a while, and did some work on the rowing machine which was good cuz my muscles in my back have been feeling weird lately.  i think it had to do with looking at meteors last night.  got my neck all out of shape.  then i called my friend andy and he said he would call me back, and finnaly after 2 hours i called him again, then he said he would call me when he got to his dads house, so like 30 minutes later i finnaly talk to him and i go to his dads house, have some take and bake pizza, then we decide to go bowling.  we get my other friend brham.  we tried to get justin and/or RJ to go, but justin is a wussie and RJ wasn't home.   so the 3 of us go and bowled.  i bowled my best ever!  i always shoot for a 100, which i did and more.  i got 113, 139,  and 150.  considering how my best before this was 119, i was pretty proud, things just kept going good for me.  like this one pin seems to spin and i thought i would stop so i turn around in disgust, then my friend laughs and says look, and i do and its down.  good luck there.  i was kicking butt.  then we went to the arcade there and played some dance dance revolution which i am hooked to.  its fun, but you get a workout quick.  i had gotton better there too.  its a lot of fun if you can actually do it.  then came back home after dropping off my friends.  i was rocking out to "i was made for loving you"  by KISS, which is a freaking awsome song.  such a great guitar riff.  i love it!  i'm all trying to sing along, but i can't.  luckly its like 12:30, so no one is on the roads to care.  then i came home, had some sparking cider.  and here is a little tip for all you, take sparking cider and add some orange juice.  very yummy.  then i talked with emily who is pretty cool, turns out see looks like sarah polley, an actress.  i thought that was kinda cool.  my grampa comes from new york tommorow, and i need to wash my car, i swear every bird in the state was bombing it today.  totally sucks.  oh well, its fun.  thats it for now, thanks for stopping by.    oh btw, ace is my bowling name, i like it.  makes me feel important!  well thats what i believe.

      Alrighty, well yesterday I felt pretty bad.  I went to my friends house and watched eurotrip and some other stuff, so that made me forget about all the stupid stuff.   then i stayed up till 4.  then i woke up today at 12:30 and listened to some everclear which helps me when i am sad becuase the lyrics are awsome.  i also looked in my yearbook which i do when i am bummed out.  then i started the graped of wrait and that made me feel better.  i guesse great writing can do that.  then i got up took a shower and sat around for a while till i just wanted to get out of the house, so i went to good will to see if they had and any letterman jackets or cool jackets in general.  then i went to the dollar store cuz i have never been there before and a lady there annoyed me.  i had my favorite tshirt that is of a prowrestler named cactus jack and it has a picture of him and it says wanted dead.  i feel pretty tough in it.  its my "screw wearing what other people like" tshirt.  but then lady goes "ohhhh! what does your shirt say?!"  and i was just trying to get out of this place and so i turn, muster out a grin, then walk away.   i felt like saying screw you lady, mind your own business, but i am not that mean.  so then i went downtown and talked with justin at the hut, then i got a slice of pizza where i saw the 3rd friend of my brothers.  all 3 were seniors when i was a freshman and they were cool to me and stuff.   then went to look at cds, and almost bought one, but didn't cuz i didn't want buy something depressed that i wouldn't want later.  i also comtemplated getting a hair cut, but that falls under the same reasoning of not getting a cd.  maybe in a few days. so then i stopped by my friends house and he wasn't home, so then i went to my brother house that he is building and looked around there as he and my dad gave me tour.   then my brother and i have this weird unspoken sibling rivalry thing, so without actually saying this, we tried to see who can beat the other home.  he was ahead of me and he took at side route and 9 times out of 10 he would have beaten me, but i had no cars in front of me and he had 5 cars in front of him when he tried to pull back on to the main road, so it was fun to point and laugh at him as he waited in line.   i swear my jeep is undeafeated in races like that.  well i probably could count on one hand that i have raced people to some place, but i have beaten himX2, brahm, duncan, and justin.  oh wait my friends mom beat me once.  crap i forgot about that!  I have been shamed.  so 5 out of 6 an't bad.  so then i had some dinner, then went to my other friends house and watched amish in the city which is interesting just to see how people who never have seen homeless people react.  its kinda a social commentary.  then i came home and watched xmen for the first time.  its was awsome.  on par with spiderman as superhero movies go.  so all and all, i am feeling better.  perhaps 3/5ths of how i usually feel (lol weird fraction)  but that was down form 13/19801, so things are looking up.  that about wraps it up for today, tune in tomorow for more about how i screw things up again and again!

      woe is me.  things were looking up and now... nothing.  the girl i like did not call me today after i left a messege. i don't think she really cares for me at all.   should i have seen this coming?  perhaps, but i really thought that i had a chance.  maybe i just made myself think that.  i have given up all hope with her.  do i think there is someone eles out there?  there always is, i just got to find her.   what is my plan?  stay up real late tonight, its almost 3 now, then sleep in as long as possible.   i don't want to get up tommorow.  i just want to sleep.  will i accomplish anything tommorow?  if all goes right, no.  will i feel better in two days?  yeah, i just need to moopp around for a day.  listen to some of my depression music.  maybe i'll go on a jog somewhere.  perhaps i will start walking in a random direction and never come back. just see where i end up.  that sounds pretty good right now.  enough of my self-absorbed manic-depressant rambling.  i'll go see if there are any infomercials.  those will help cheer me up.  adios friends.

      well well well.   its monday, that means headlines will be on tonight, so I am looking forward to those.  their funny if you haven't seen them on the tonight show with jay leno.  Highly funny.  go watch them.  in other news, i called the girl i like at about 3 and left a messege.  then waited around for a few hours, then went to a friends house where i watched raiders of the lost arc.  a movie i have seen the last half of.  its a good movie, but i relized halfway through that the chick in it, indiana love interest is the same girl from animal house, and the thought of animal house in an indiana jones movie kinda annoyed me. not that i don't like animal house, i love it, but you don't combine it with indiana jones.  then i got home and the girl called me back some time between 8:30 and 9, and i got home at 9:30, so i won't call her back tonight, but should i?  i usually don't call people after 9 unless they tell me to just so i won't annoy other people in the house.  is that a resonable rule espcially under the current circumstances?  i'm not sure, but i will deffinetly call her tommorow.  thats about it for now.  gonna see if i can get x-men in before headlines.  see ya later.  thanks for reading.

      hello friends!  Its one am and on the spure of the moment, I decided to come on the computer and see if anyone was online.   Sadly, no one is.  I was about to go to bed after watching this awsome infomercial.  I love infomercials, I just can't change the channel.  this one was selling the blender that was pretty wicked.  Last night I watched one that had some sweet knives.  40 Bucks for like 15 knives that never wear out!  I was ready to pick up the phone.  I think it is in my nature to be easaily convinced of something.  Ya could tell me why we would should worship cheese, and I would be with ya in 10 minutes.   Its kinda a fun trait.  Not sure why, but I like the idea of jumping onto the bandwagon so to speak.   Some of todays disturbing news.. my mom's friend's daughter and son.  their nice people from LA, but it seems the son, who is like...I suck with guessing ages... probably 8 seems to be stealing money and stuff from us.  I kinda don't want to hear that just becuase he is 8.  I think it goes back to my theory that if you expect the worst in people, you are gonna get that.  So after hearing this, I checked my wallet and cds to see if anything was stolen.   I am kinda unsure of this kid.  i think i am gonna keep my distance from him and make sure he stays away from my room.  he reminds me of this roommate i had at this camp this summer who stole a mini flag from me.  he was a quiet guy who was kinda a dork, so i really didn't expect him to steal from me.  kinda felt bad for him.  back to this little kid, one of my other theorys is that is someone wants something so bad as to steal it from you, well they might need it more.  not so say stealing is the way to go, but thats how i see it.  also in todays news, i went to the gym, ran a little, did some stuff on the machines.  afterwords i was so dizzy.  i was tripping over stuff.  i have never had that happen to me before.  i got home and still was dizzy and was surprised i drove home so well.  well in reality i did try to run over some kids who stepped in front of me at a stop sign.  little punks.  should have taken them down!  i did lay down and finished the book i had been reading, so now i can start something eles.  grapes of wrait is my next challenge.  i kinda enjoy reading, but i find it to be kinda slow and tedius and it takes concentration.  a good book can make it all worth it though, the problem is finding that type of book.    at the gym i listened to everclear's "world of noise"  which is a great piece of music.  raw and grungy.  i forgot how good it is.  nothing quite compares to it.  the lyrics and raw passion as he screams his heart out are awsome.   that girl i like never did call me back, so i will call her tommorow.  i get nervous at those things.  so much that i forget why i like the girl in the first place, so i try to remind myself why.  certain songs/movies remind me of her, so i try to listen/watch those.  heck, lots of songs remind of different people and different girls i've liked.  i listen to some groups and say those belong to so and so.  basically this girl i like has quite a lot of my music.  weezer, the cure, tom petty, alabama, some of the beatles, cheap trick, flaming lips, buddy holly, some modest mouse, steve miller band, mxpx. thats about it.  basically if i like the girl at the time i buy a cd, that cd reminds me of her.  and those are cds i have gotton over the last year which is how long i have liked her.  i did order a cd that has old nintendo covers on it, so she should get that depending how long it take and if i still like her.   I love not having a job!  it rules! the other day i got a check for 90 bucks that i had coming to me that i forgot about from work.  i was gonna give it to my mom for insurance on my car, but then i spent half of it in silverdale.  i played some backyard golf today and it made me want to go play minigolf.  i hate real golf.  i don;t mind watching it, just playing it is so frustrating.  i should go up to the driving range and let some range out.   one of my all time best times was actually on 9/11.  some friend and i went to the driving range after school.  i don't the events of the day had really hit us.  and while my one friend hit a shot, the head off the club went flying off and it made this "ping" sound that still makes me laugh thinking about.  it was so funny to look over to see what the ping was, look at his club, see no head, look down the range, and see the head bouncing down.  it was freaking awsome.  i think i will wash my car tommorow.  it needs it and i want it to look nice if i see that girl. oh speaking of that girl, well if you read i think my blog 2 post ago, i talked about calling her and having to ask for her twice to two people.  i was thinking that maybe this other guy was a boyfriend or something.  like she has a brother, so i figure the first guy was him, but then the 2nd threw me off.  i am not sure if that was him again, i doubt it was her dad.  she did say she had a friend over, so that might have been him.  i'm just paranoid i guesse.  (extra e!)  i'll find out tommorow.  i've been thinking that next year i am gonna flood the schools server with music just to always have it.  there is nothing like rocking out to van halen in the library.  people give you weird looks, librains tell you to turn it off.  oh yes good times.  i decided i really hate anti-babcterial liquid soop.  why, well as a fingernail bitter, it gives a bad taste.  that sounds disguesting, but if any of you also partake in this habit, you know what i am talking about. well i have been typing for basically the last 40 minutes.  i wanted to get all this stuff out of my mind, so i sleep well.  i can't sleep if i have a lot on my mind.  i guesse (extra e!) that is normal for everyone.  well i'm glad you got to here, becuase i wrote a ton.  please let my know what you think of anything here.  ya agree, dissagree?  well let me know.  adios friends!

      ahh, so refreshed.  I got up this morning at 7:30 to go to church after being up to 1:30, and I neeeeed 8 hours of sleep and if I don't I am out of it.  so this morning I was most sleepy.  Barely could keep my eyes open at church.  then I slept in the car afterwards in the safeway parking lot while my dad got the paper and stuff.  then I got home and sleept for the next hour and a half, then had breakfast and now I feel 110% better.  I just love naps.  I feel great afterthem.  I never have taken a nap untill last year, which I find most weird, but working and school wore me out and when I came home from school, I would watch a movie and fall asleep even though I was trying to pay attention to the movie.  Now I don't fight naps.  The're awsome.   Thats all now.  I think I might inlist in the KISS army.  :)

      Alrighty, Today was perhaps my best day ever!  I went to Seattle to see my favorite all-time musician do an acoustic show at Emp.  I drove down to Bainbridge Island, walked across the ferry with 1 minute to spare (no exaggeration), then walked what seemed like forever up to EMP.  It was hot and uphill, so it really sucked.   I went to this little concert there that featured my favorite Band's lead singer, Art Alexakis of Everclear.  It was really cool.  I made it to the show with 15 minutes to spare and he comes out and plays some songs and jokes around with the audience.  Like he was telling us how he played for a preschool, and he changed the title to the song "You make me feel like a whore" to "You make me feel like I am four"  Pretty funny stuff.  He played some of Everclears best songs, and some new ones that will be released on their next album.  It was so awsome to see him live in person.  He is so awsome.  He did an encore, then afterwords, he came out and was talking with fans and doing autographs, So i got into the crowd around him.  I got his autograph on my ticket, then I got a picture with him (Soooo gonna frame that one!) and I asked him about this CD that he was gonna release from his old band from like 15 years ago.  He was really nice.  I just about peeded my pants after all this.  I still can't believe that I met him.  He is my idol!  So friggin happy!  Oh and coming back to the ferry, I made the return ferry home with 1 minute to spare.  I would say luck was with me today.  Still can't believe it all happened. Alright, well thats that for now.  Adios friends.
