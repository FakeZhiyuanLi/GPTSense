       Another day has pass, aiya looks lyk final year exam coming soon lao, 4 more weeks to go. Hear the word FYE has oredi made me very sian lao. Dun feel lyk studying leh, but nvm la once in a while work hard for exam will do some good. Wat more can i comment on, this year streaming lao, try to make it into a good class n also hope my IP interview is a success. Anyway the main reason i choose IP cause its challending, better than currently SJI one. SJI next year take 9 subject, NJ take double the amount. Actually double the amount also ok one la, except that i will be more busy n the workload jus piles on.

       2day got 2 go for fencing course. aiya, very sian. Other than learning somethings about fencing, its quite a waste of time. The whole time go there n slack. But this is better than training. Go there for 2 hours just to relax n learn a bit on how to fence. The best part is the demo match, then the rest is like very boring. Learning how 2 move front n back . Actually prefer 2 do others things than this. The worts of all, after course i have to write a report, omg, i really dun noe wat to write. Must get my "facts" rite man, got to write a ns report. Oh well, life lyks tt.

       2day a knooty problem surface. I received a letter form NJC saying i short-listed to go for e interview. Quite shock actually, i though i would flung my 2nd test. Now i have to make two choice. one: stay in SJI, two: go NJC for IP. If i leave i will disappoint quite a no. of ppl. First, my cca teachers would be sad. They r counting on me to win the next campcraft com plus lead the unit. Some of my frens will also be sad to c me go, lyk Ben Huang, whole day calling me to fail my test. (*sigh). Looks lyk my fate lies here. If i leave, hope that my teachers can understand. The thing tt i will miss is my cca, taught me many things n also made quite a lot of frens. If i could return for cca i definitely will return.

       2day after sepak takraw com me n my frens went bowling at cdan. Oh sad case man, only got 34 points!(Ahhhhhh) Now i noe bowling is not tt easy after all. Quite a number of shots went down the drain. Oh well looks lyk i need more partice. After tt i went 2 watch the air rifle com. Louis was a professional. Almost every shot was near the bull's eye. Wat i cant believe is that ACSI team can shot 1623 out of 1800 (Kena Shock: 1623!!!!). This means trt every target must be at least 8 or 9 to score that. OMG thats almost impossible loh unless u r in the air rifle team. Anyway i saw quite a few ppl who r also very good. A gal from nygh in the first lane did quite well. I have to leave at 4 so could not watch the whole competition. All i can is pray that we win.( Hope so cause Mr Goh will wish we win :) )

        Today i went for the Prefect interview. The first thing that the HOL told me when i went for the interview: "I believe you applied for IP program." Then the next thing he told me: "To be a prefect you have to be loyal to the school. You have the qualities and your results are good. Im not questioning you about your loyality but just to let you know that if you became a prefect someone else cant be."This struck me. Should i be a prefect or not. If i became a prefect, then i ought to saty in SJI. This concern about my future so i have to decide carefully. If i want to stay, i will want to be a csm. Then it will be worth it. So should i stay, i also had no idea.

       Recently my form tutor, Mr Foo, has been strucked by dengue fever. All i can hope is that he may have a speedy recovery and can be back in the classroom teaching us again. This is his last year teaching, therefore we wish that he could have a good time first before he retire. The tests are also coming up soon. The history test is on 19, which is next week. I wonder how can we pass this test. Looks like this time we will have to learn everything ourselves. Maybe this is a test to us, to see who can really have the discipline to really get down to hard work. This time i am preparing to teach my friends maths, since our teacher cannot put points across then i will do it.

        Today test is extremely hard, the time given is extremely short. The science paper is still ok, quite reasonable. The maths paper was difficult, cause of that time given was too short. Most of my classmates could not finish their test in time. Oh well, looks like its game over for a few of my friends. Luckily i manged to finish everything in time. After the test quite a lot of people were complaining. Anyway, sometimes it is not totally our fault. A lot of people were complaining about our maths teacher, which is usually absent from school and left everything to us to sort it out ourselves. And of course her pace in the lesson is also very slow. One graph per lesson and about 3 to 4 questions solved in an hour. No wonder everybody does their work so slow. I wonder how some of my classmates going to pass the exams on octuber. If we still get this type pf teachers i really feel quite sad. For me its ok since i never depend on teachers to increase my knowledge. Maybe now in secondary school it is better to study on your own.

        What more can i say, tomorrow two test in a row. The teacher has indeed created a pile of mess for us to clear. I have to thank my maths teacher for been so "wonderful" and left us to do independent learning.Oh well, looks like we will have to buck up. For me, it seems that i will have to study everything all over again. I have almost forgotten the things that i have learnt after fooling around for so long. Hope im not too late to relearn very thing for the final year exam. Oh well, there are simply too many things for me to worry about.

       National Day is meant to be a day of celebration and reflection. For me, it just another busy day to finish all my work. Oh well life like that. Worse of all, on Wednesday there are two tests. Too many things for me to worry about. The teachers are very clever. They fix the test on certain dates which for us find it quite difficult to cope and of course our marvellous teachers has done "very detailed" teaching in class, especially our maths teacher. Oh well looks like we have to depend on ourselves to study on our own.

       Living the same life everyday would be very boring.Imagine doing the same thing over and over again. Actually for me, school days are boring as partically i do almost the same thing everyday. Now i am trying to add some colours to my school life, rather than doing the same things everyday. I start to take part in more activities in school. Through the process of those activities actually can develop ones character. Through those activities, (e.g. competition, course and CIP) i have learn that responsiblity is very important. Not only that, working as a team is another point. Actually going to school is not purely because of studying, its more about learning the ways of life and also to improve on our character. Although lessons can be very boring but then education is a part of our life. Treat school seriously and it will help in the future.

        Last night was school annual parade. I was in supporting contingent marching. Lots of things screw up yesterday. It was quite embrassesing actually. Oh well is all over :p . The speeches made by the principal and the guest of honour was quite short :) unlike last year which was extremely long. Actually its an honour to be in annual parade and also to put up a good show, especially if one is receiving award. It will be good if i can go to guard of honour contingent, can wear the no. 1 uniform in parade. Oh well if i stay in SJI maybe i will get a chance to wear it then. The test for IP in NJC was very diificult. The English paper was very tough. Most of the vocab questions i cant do. Maybe this is a wake up call for me to start studying.
