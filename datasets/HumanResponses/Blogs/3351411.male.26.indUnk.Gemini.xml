      This entry will deal with:  Religious beliefs versus Benefits of medical treatment - -------  History records many cases in which people have been willing to die for their beliefs. We are all familiar with the stories of people who have endured death rather than deny what faith or reason led them to hold as an important truth.  And who should have a say in whether those faced by this choice should live or die?  One group that many are familiar with are the Jehovah’s Witnesses.  I'm just using them as an example, not pointing anyone out =)  They do not accept blood transfusions.  This goes agains their beliefs.  I remember reading about a case a long time ago where a woman was almost unconsious but she made it known that she did not want a blood transfusion if it became necessary.  Turns out she needed one, but her husband got a court order giving the doctor's the "go ahead" to go along with blood transfusion procedures.  The woman's life was saved where she would've died without the transfusion.  Was this the right thing to do?  Even though I do not share in her beliefs, I believe this was wrong.  The procedure went against her faith in this case.  The court should have never given her husband the right to get her a transfusion.  The end result...the woman turned around and sued the hospital because her "beliefs" were set aside in favour of another determined to preserve her life.  I have the strong opinion that when it comes to health care, people should be allowed to choose what and if any procedures they want to do.  Period.  If they want to die and the reasons are "right" then let them. I'll take any procedure that would save my live! But for many, this is not the case and they should be allowed to do what they want.  I know this opinion is harsh, but hey it's my opinion =)

      I came across an article today titled, “Cost-Cutting on Drugs Has Health Cost.” I’ll attach the link at the bottom.  This to me is common sense. If you cut back or don’t take the drugs prescribed to you, then you will most likely suffer the consequences. However, the issue here: Why is this happening? Simply put, prescription costs are just too high for a significant part of the population and people have been forced to cut back on their medications as a result.  The article states that, “New research shows, for the first time, that people with preexisting chronic medical conditions who curtailed their prescription medications because of cost were 76 percent more likely to then suffer a significant decline in their overall health and 50 percent more likely to have a nonfatal heart attack, stroke or chest pain episode than those who did not cut back.”  I have strong opinions on this issue as I used to be involved in the insurance industry. I have seen so many people lose all of their money because they are forced to pay these high prescription prices. I once came across a person who paid over $500 a month just on prescriptions. To me, that is just insane especially since there aren’t many health plans out there that cover prescriptions, especially for the elderly. Now, why are these prices so high?  I blame the government. The pharmaceutical industry is one of the only (if not the only) government regulated private industries in the U.S. People can get prescriptions cheaper out of the country, but technically we are not supposed to. How can the same drugs cost 50% cheaper in Canada than in our own country. There is definitely a problem with that.  People’s lives depend on these prescriptions. If they are forced to choose between paying for prescriptions or having a roof over their heads or food on the tables, which makes more sense? I don’t even need to respond to that because the answer is too simple.   Something needs to be done about this problem and soon. If insurance companies would offer better prescription coverage’s, then people could take their medications. As it stands now, many are opting not to take their medications because of the cost. I think that if prescription coverage was better, more people would take their prescriptions and thus not get sicker. If they get sicker, there are more hospital visits which cost even more money. I believe if you offer better prescription coverage, it will reduce the overall costs to insurance companies in the first place.  But like always, it’s just my opinion =)  Here’s the link to the article I responded to: http://health.yahoo.com/search/healthnews?lb=s&p=id%3A59607

      This entry kind of deals with my last entry regarding the abortion of a health twin, while carrying the other to full-term...  The article I read is titled, "Ethicists, doctors debate multiple births"  As we all know, the use of fertility drugs has been know to cause multiple births.  Although fertility drugs have given people the "miracle" of birth, these drugs are also not perfect.  Often these drugs lead to multiple births and this may not be seen as a bad thing, but the babies being born aren't always healthy if alive at all.  This is where the debate over ethics comes into play.  Recently, a mother gave birth to octuplets (6 girls and 2 boys).  All but one of the babies is on life support and many will have profound handicaps throughout their lives -- both physical and mental handicaps.  Multiple births are a concern to both doctors and patients.  Ethicists say being pregnant with so many babies forces women to make difficult moral and ethical decisions.  They have to choose between three conflicting values -- their own health, in having to carry so many fetuses; the health of their fetuses; and the moral values of whether or not you have to abort one or more of those fetuses.  To tell you the truth, I don't know how I feel about this issue.  Fertility drugs can help people have the child they have always wanted but couldn't do naturally.  People, however, sometimes get more than they ask for.  Fertility drugs need to be perfected.  I know I wouldn't want to care for EIGHT babies at once - I would be both mentally and physically exhausted all the time.  I just know I couldn't handle that and I believe I'm not the only one who feels this way.  These children will face handicaps their whole lives.  Is this fair to the child?  Well...that's an entire other issue that I won't dive into, but some say that some life is better than no life.  I don't necessarily agree with that, but hey that's my opinion =).

      This entry is a response to an article I saw on CNN regarding the abortion of a healthy twin that sparked a debate in Britain.  A financially strapped mother aborted one healthy twin because, of course, she felt she didn't have enough money to support two.  The majority of the debate, in this case is how she chose which twin to abort.  How do you choose which twin to abort and which twin to keep if both are healthy?  This is a weird case for me.  I'm an advocate for abortions and I have always believed that it is the woman's choice.  I only believe this if the woman is doing it for the right reasons.  What are the right reasons?  Well...I don't really know honestly.  It depends on the individual case.  In this case, she chose two keep "one" and abort one.  I really don't know how you can choose between two identical babies.  I just find something wrong with this case and I really can't explain why.  It's just kind of disturbing...haha.    How do you feel?

      I came across yet another article on human cloning on Yahoo! Health  It was regarding Britain's first application to clone a human embryo to obtain cells that could be used to treat otherwise incurable diseases.  First of all, Britain has rigid laws against reproductive cloning to produce "designer babies," but does permit therapeutic cloning under strict conditions to battle illnesses like diabetes. The Hman Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) will be considering an application to make a clone to produce insulin.   All of this, of course, brings up the debate over the ethics of human cloning.  Many people associate cloning with the movies and all of the terrible things that happen when people are cloned.  This, of course, is most likely not a reality.  Things like this won't happen.    This kind of technology can create material that would be genetically identical to a person who needs treatment.  They are not attempting to produce cloned babies but collections of so-called stem cells that can divide into any tissue in the body.  I think this is essential in today's society if we plan to fight diseases and ailments in the human body.  This kind of technology does not happen overnight, it takes years to produce results.  By having restraints on the practice of cloning today, we are losing years and consequently, lives.  Is this worth the cost?  My opinion is NO, but like always, it's just my opinion =)

      I recently read an article regarding the death penalty in the United States and the ethics involved in lethal injections.  The article I read dealt mainly with the "abolitionist" point of view, and I am in favor of the death penalty.  It was a good article because it exposed me to other people's point of view and they did bring up a few good legal points regarding the issue.  The article concerned doctors who helped with lethal injections at executions, which is a complex ethical area in the fields of law and medicine.  In my opinion, by attacking these doctors, it is just a move to influence public opinion regarding this issue.  Abolitionists are looking to charge doctors with professional misconduct for participating in executions.  Their argument states that physicians take the Hippocratic Oath to take care of and preserve life, not to end it.  It is also of note that the American Medical Association's medical ethics code bars doctors from participating in a legally authorized execution.  Abolotionists also state that it is unnacceptable for physicians to sacrifice a condemned inmate's comfort during their final minutes for the sake of making a political stand.  From a legal aspect, I understand their opinion.  I believe the American Medical Association should update their ethics code so that it may include policies on lethal injections and so forth.  I have always believed in the doctrine of "an eye for an eye."  This is just my opinion and I don't expect everyone to believe that.  Regardless, it makes for interesting debate!  =)

      I found an interesting article on Yahoo! News about how teen dieting may lead to audlt obesity so I decided to write about it in my journal.  There is so much news today about dieting and health.  Who is to know what is good and what is not?  The sad truth is that we will probably never know and "fad" diets will continue to be popular until a new "rave diet" becomes popular.  Reaction to the article:  There was a study done on teenage girls and their dieting habits.  Apparently, new research suggests that the dieting habits of teenage girls offer a crystal ball into their future.  Those who tried the hardest to lose weight as adolescents are most likely to become obese adults.  It was the study's view that dieting may disrupt the metabolism of teen girls, setting them up for obesity later in life.  This was a study done of 149 obese women from 2000 to 2001. I believe this was a good study, but I think a little more in-depth research needs to be done.  I do agree, however, that fad diets often focus on quick weight loss, instead of the best way - very slow and gradual weight loss.  Unfortunately an appropriate study of a greater magnitude would be too costly.  That's just politics for you, even though obesity is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. today - surpassing even cigarette smoke, i believe...  Article link:  http://health.yahoo.com/search/healthnews?lb=s&p=id%3A59309  The findings of the survey can also be found in the Journal of the American Diabetic Association in the June 2004 issue

      Hope everyone is having a good week!  I caught this interesting article on "www.cnn.com" last night and I'll attach a link for those of you interested at the bottom.  The article is titled:  "Scientists find rodent monogamy gene"  I have always found genetics to be an interesting issue, but this article caught my attention because it's not something you see every day.    Apparently scientists pinpointed the gene for monogomy in prairie voles (related to the mouse).  Their cousin, the meadow voles, are quite the opposite and don't prefer just one partner.  Of course, someone had the bright idea to inject the gene, which was attached to a harmless virus, then inserted into the promiscuous meadow voles.    Well the injection worked and the resulting expiriment found that after the gene was inserted into the meadow vole, they came to prefer just one partner like their cousins.    It's amazing to me how this works.  To pinpoint a gene, find a way to attach it to a host, and then inject it into an animal AND have it work is just mind-boggling, but that's science for ya!  The real debate here is as to whether or not this would work for humans.  The opinion of the article seems to not think so, but I have my reservations.  I think that if they pinpoint a similar gene in humans it might work too.  Why not?  What do you think?
