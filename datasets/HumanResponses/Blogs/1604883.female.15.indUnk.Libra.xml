      Hey sorry I  haven't put in a new entry but blogger was updating their site so I had to wait.  Nothing much has happened over the past few days. I've woken up everyday around 12:00 and watched a daily routine of TV that consits of two episodes of Whose the Boss?, followed by Family Matters,The Cosby Show, Two episodes of Fresh Prince and then three episodes of Roseanne. After I watch TV I usually go rent a movie with my brother,but now my brother went with his friend Matt to his cottage.  I suppose ill finally have to do something. I finished reading Harry Potter today and I got the Our Lady Peace CD the first day it came out and I think its pretty good. Its almost CANADA DAY!!!! YAY. Canada Day is one of the best days because you get to see a parade and fireworks at night, good times. Well I don't really have much to say because nothing is new well I have to go o yah and please leave some shout outs for me!

      So I'm trying to get my brother to hire me as his personal assistant for the summer but he doesn't think its such a great idea. I've been waiting all day for someone to take me to the mall to get the new Our Lady Peace CD but no one wants too. Well today I did absolutely nothing except read and watch TV. I cant stop reading that new Harry Potter book. I know I sound like a dork but o well I love Harry Potter ok and I don't care who knows. Its only the second official day of summer vacation and I'm already bored which is sad but id rather be here at home doing nothing then having to go to school. I'm watching A Christmas Story right now and I think its one of the funniest movies of all time!All that kid wants is a BB gun. Well anyway I hope tomorrow is more eventful then today or else I'm gunna start losing my mind!

      Well not much is new here. Last night I went to go see 2Fast 2Furious with Lindsay, Elyse and Angela. That movie was so awesomely good. I bought like five million pounds of candy to eat during the movie and then I didn't feel to well.  Those milke duds always get me their candy on the outside and then POISON on the inside. Well after that we all came back to my hose and watched the MMVAs and it was kinda a disappointment becasuse its always the same bands nominated but on the plus side Our Lady Peace one a few.  Speaking of which their new Live cd is coming out tomorrow and I need some money to get it. When they went home I read Harry Potter again for like 2 hours.   This morning I woke up at 12:30 and watched saved by the bell with my brother. Then I read again for at least 2 hours and since my mom isn't home I had to make my own lunch so all I ate today was a peanut butter sandwich and some pudding. Now me and my brother are going to buy something that lets you play gameboy games on the gamecube system!!!SWEET!!!!!Well that's all!

      First I'll start out with a little bit about myself. My name is Ema Dreseris and I go to Norhtern High School in Sarnia Ontario.  I live with my mom, my dad, my brother and sister.  I am the youngest out of four kids (unfortunately).  My brother Adam just graduated from Waterloo University and he lives with us again.  My sister Maika lives in Waterloo where she works at Burger King and Zellers.  My sister Natalija just graduated high school and now she's moving to Niagra Falls (YAY).   My mom works at high park school where all the psychos go (sorry Lindsay) and my dad works at Sunoco.  There isn't much to do in Sarnia except when my friends and I are causing trouble.  Yesterday me and my friend Elyse went to USA.  Some people there are so rude.  We went to Applebees and our waiter didn't smile once and Elyse found a hair in her Hamburger...SICK!!!!.  When we came back to good ole'Sarnia we called up Lindsay Parrot.  She came over and we went to the corner store and I bought the greatest thing ever!!!!It was a white chocolate Reese peanut butter cup and let me tell you its the greatest thing since sliced bread! The other day I bought those new Sunday flavored smarties and there the sickest thing I've ever tasted in my life and I've eaten dog treats. They shouldn't mess with such a great thing like smarties. Well anyway when we came home we watched good burger and then played super monkey balls on game cube. After they both left I stayed up till like 1:00 in the morning reading the new Harry Potter book. I think this book may possibly be the greatest book ever! Its even better then the book about that boy and the chocolate factory. Well that's all for now!

      Greg....The name of my new bass teacher is Greg! Well anyways I'm bored as usual. I didn't do much today but however we did have quite the interesting supper. Adam wasn't there because he was eating steaks with Mike. Well it started out fine but then tali asked my mom when she was going to get a computer and my mom said she though that tali was gunna use Maikas old one and tali wasn't too happy about that then the phone rang and it was Maika telling my mom she hadn't found a lap top for France yet so my mom started crying and Tali got mad that she has to use all of maikas old things and she started crying then my mom left and Tali complained to my dad and everyone was mad so I ran up to my room to hide so that I don't get blamed for anything because usually when tali wants something she says well Ema has a TV in her room and then my parents feel bad. Yah I know I have a lot of things in my room but that's because I either ask at the right time or I ask people for there old things. For instance I have my grandmothers old TV which is broken so everything on the screen looks green, Maikas old cd player, Adams Nintendo and I got the computer for my birthday because it was on sale. Otherwise I have to buy all my own things ( for example: turtle, guitar, giant crayon). Pretty soon all the fighting will be over with because maikas going to France and tali is going to Niagara falls and me and Adam don't fight, but I think Adam is leaving because he wants to become a cop! That will be weird...Just me and my parents here!Well I don't really have anything else to say

      I'm very excited because I just got internet in my room!!!! Nothing much is new around here, I'm bored a usual but o well. I had another bass lesson only my regular teacher wasn't there so I had some creepy old guy and he took me to a room in the back and I was scared but he was nice! Well anyway I can't wait to go to Montreal!!! The only down side is that when we go to Montreal we're dropping Maika off at the Airport for France and I won't see her for a while.  It's almost Adam's Birthday so I have to spend money again which sucks because I don't have any anyways. I need a job maybe I'll apply for head chef at McDonalds!!!That would be fun...NOT....But a job is a job right? I need money and if I have to work at McDonalds I will. That's how desperate I am. I get 20$ every other week for allowance and I usually go see a move the first day which means I can't have any money for the next week. I wish I were rich then I'd take all of my friends who deserve it  to the IHOP. Anyways a few days ago we all went to Niagara Falls to find a place for Natalija to live and mission accomplished. I guess this means she's really leaving! That sucks :( I'm so sad.......NOT.... haha I had you going for a while, she's probably one of the meanest people on earth but when she wants to be she can be nice...I guess. I went to Jade Mini Mart the other day or Lucky variety (my corner store) and it was like stepping into bazzaro world. I walked in and they are now serving ice cream there which is weird because it's a corner store. All my life Jades has been the same until a few days ago! I'm not saying there's anything wrong with Ice Cream, Personally I love and yes Adam I would marry it if I could! Well I better get going to bed I'm sure I have a long day of doing absolutely nothing ahead of me! And the time is not 11:00 it's really 2:09 am!

      Wow I haven't written anything in a long time but I've been extremely busy lately. A few days ago the Mainville family came to our house from Oakville to go to Bayfest. The first concert was Sum 41 and Blink 182 and it was awesome. We all started watching the concert in a big group. During Sum 41 I thought I was going to die because so many people were pushing but then Angela and I went to the over 19 side for Blink 182 and it was a lot better. The next day the we all went under the bridge for fries and to the mall and then we went to the Barenaked Ladies concert. I think that that concert was the best on because those guys are pretty funny and there songs are really good! The next day we went to see Matthew Good and we waited for like 2 hours in the boiling hot sun but when the concert went on it was good and towards the end we were really close to the stage but the only think was that we all got sunburned. At night Foo Fighters and Cheap Trick played and I didn't really enjoy it but matt lost his shoe in the mosh pitt. The best part of that concert was the bus ride home because there were three drunk guys on the bus and they were being loud and annoying so some guy at the front of the bus told them to shut up so the drunk guys started calling them tough guy and tough guy called the one drunk guy cool guy. So when it was cool guys stop tough guy went out to so they would fight but nothing really happened but it was cool the whole bus was watching them fight and then we left and went home. This morning the Maivilles left and I did nothing all day because I'm so tired and all I want to do is sleep! Well I'm gunna get going

The next day I did absolutely nothing but watch TV Big brother 4 started now and I'm obsessed with it because its soooooo good. I love big brother so much. Today I didn't do much yet but the night is young and elyse is suppose to call me so we'll probably do something together as usual! Well that's all for now!

      Not yesterday but the day before Elyse came over to my house and then we went to the mall. we're both broke so we only bought cheap stuff and then went to McDonalds. When my parents drove us home we watched Back to the Future and then  she went home. As you can tell my life is pretty much the same thing everyday and i always hang out with elyse!  Yesterday Adam,my mom and my dad and i went to a flea market in Grand Bend and i bought some old mad magazines. when we came home we watched About Schmidt and then i listened to music and went to bed.  Today i woke up around 12:00 and watched 2 episodes of Who's the Boss and then Family Matters,the Cosby Show but instead of Fresh Prince they had Futurama and Family Guy on so I watched them instead. then I watched one episode of Roseanna and Pepperann and i cleaned my room. Natalija came home and she told me that if i cleaned her room she would give me $5.00 so i did. Now im watching Spongebob Squarepants and talking to people on msn! well thats all for now.

      Wow so much has happened in the past few days. First I'll talk about Canada Day. I'll start out with telling you something important: last Canada Day my whole family was sitting in the car when a guy on the radio said "Canada Day, try saying that three times fast!", so my brother Adam decided he would do it but instead of just saying it three times we decided to count how many times you could do it without taking a break. So now my whole family does it and we see who wins and whoever does it the most on Canada Day wins! So this year I woke up early in the morning nad my brother was already up and he decided to try it. I counted for him and he got 53 which is the new record! Anyway after that my mom,brother and our next door neighbor's and me went to the parade. It was the usual Canada Day parade it had mostly trucks and cars but o well. It was a whole lot shorter this year then other years!(which is good because after you see one car you've pretty much seen them all!). After that we all went for fries at Centenial park and I spilt gravy on my pants. Then we went home and had a bbq at my next door neighbor's house with my favorite thing SHISH KABOBS (I don't know if I spelt that right but o well). Then me and my parents went to the fireworks and they were a lot better this year. All in all it was a good Canada Day.  The next day I woke up at 7:30 to go to waterloo because Adam had an appointment and to visit Maika! When we got there we went straight to Adams appointment and my mom and I waited it the boiling hot car for an hour while Adam went in. After that we went to Maika's apartment and then we went to Swiss Chalet and I had the chicken fingers. I hate chicken! That's all we ever eat at my house is chicken: roast chicken, club sandwiches, chicken fried rice, bbq chicken, chicken from zehrs,shake and bake, etc..You know half the people at my school have never had shake and bake and I find that sad! While anyway after that we went to do some errands and we went to Cosco which is the greatest place on earth.  We got home around 5:00 because I had my first bass guitar lesson at 5:30. My teacher is really nice he teaches me good songs and he also went to Errol Road so that's always something to talk about.  The next day Elyse called because she was back from Ottawa and she had a good time. I went over to her house and we watched movies and talked. I slept over and the next morning (today) we watched movies and stuff and then we came over ot my house to go to the Sunoco company picnic. We got a lot of free stuff and we saw a live band! It was fun! When we came home I watched South Park and played Wario on gamecube. Now I'm looking for bass tabs so I'm gunna go!

      I can safely say that this was the worst trip to montreal i have ever had!First of all it was so hot in my grandmothers house and she doesnt have air conditioning so that sucked. Then i didnt buy anything or do anything really fun. Then on the trip home everyone was cranky and yelling at eachother....but on the plus side we were in Quebec when the biggest power failure in Northe american history came but since Quebec is on a different power grid nothing happened. Well that was about the whole trip....

      Yesterday we went to the Toronto Airport to drop off Maika to go to France. When we got there Brad, Nikki and Alison were already waiting for us and then they went in line and me and Adam went to the Arcade! Then when maika got on the plane everyone was sad and some people cried (ie. My mom). Then we drove to oakville because we're spending two nights here and then we're going to montreal.Today we went back to Toronto and we went shopping and i bought some drum sticks because i figure that if i have the drum sticks my mom will have to buy me the drum set. So that pretty much all thats happened so far but im sure the trip to montreal will be interesting....my mom is already mad at Natalija for asking for money!

      We went to Waterloo yesterday to pack up Maika's stuff and bring it back to Sarnia. When we got there we went straight to Toronto because Maika had to go to the French embassy and it was closed so Maika was mad and then we went back to Waterloo. We ate supper at Swiss Chalet....What a surprise! And then we just packed up her stuff. The next morning Adam came with John Lapps (our neighbor) company van so that we could pack all of her stuff. There hasn't been anything else really going on.

      Well it's sepetember eleventh again which meens another year has passed since the world trade center attacks.  It makes me think about where i was that day. I was at Errol Road school and I remember our teacher told us what had happened and I dont think that anyone really understood what had happened....i know i didnt.  During science class a kid was looking up pictures of it and when we saw the actual pictures we realized what how big of a deal it was.  Like for two weeks after it happened I was so obsessed with it and like i looked up pictures and storys and watched every special that was on t.v. On rememberence day our class paid a tribute to it and i remember how many people were crying when we turned on the lights. Well enough of this sappy stuff i gotta go

      Well school started the other day (unfortunatly) and it's just as boring as it was last year. My teachers are all ok though but its just the subjects that are boring. I think that Careers ist the dumbest subject in school! My favorite class right now is Arts and Crafts cuz it's easy except that i got moved to a different table then all of my friends cuz we were too loud. All the grade 9s are at our school now and it's weird to see all of them at Northern but i havent really talked to them all that much! anyways i have to go do some homework so...ya

      Elyse is over and were having a good time!We watched Longshot. It was pretty bad. Yesterday i went to go see Elf with Lindsay and Bethany. It was without a doubt the best movie ive ever seen.Then we went to tim hortons and had a nice discussion about death. Well thats all for now.Oh and p.s. i just wanted to say that i like the song Feeling This by Blink 182 because usually when i start liking a song and then it becomes popular and i tell everyone that i liked it they dont believe me so here i am telling you guys i like it before it becomes populkar and overplayed.

      Hi everybody. I have had a pretty good week so far which is awesome! yesterday during third period someone pulled the fire alarm and i got to see all firemen and fire trucks and the whole school waited outside for like a half an hour till we were aloud back in and then in forth period there was a football game so we didnt have to go to class. Lindsay bethany and me all went to the mall and we ate pizza and bought birthday presents for kelsey. Today nothing much really happened except the usual. Mr.Little called us all stupid again and we played with lego at lunch. Adam said that he has a surprise for me and im a little scared.  I was wondering if anyone knows where the line "Like You Know Whatever"comes from because we've been trying to figure it out for a while now. I havent really been writing a lot so i think ill try to start writing again! i bought some candy canes yesterday and they were really good! well ill see yall later

      Well the whole me and Elyse thing didn't work out so I hung out with Bethany.  We went to see Win A Date With Tad Hamilton and it was alright. Hey Adam I think that you should go see Barlow and get me their autographs, did you like the bass that mark plays in the I Miss You video because I know how much you like that sort of thing.

      Hey Yadam not only was it pizza hut but it was stuffed crust pizza! Tali is coming home this weekend so that should be fun! NOT haha. Yes Adam I saw that Clark had glasses now and I thought it was also funny how the mom said to the dad "you and Clark never want anyone to help you, you think your supermen or something". Today me and Elyse might get together and watch Pirated of the Caribbean. Bye

      I was just wondering if anyone caught the world premier of the new I Miss You video by Blink 182. It's a very interesting video and I just saw it today....It was awesome.  I got a new jacket and some movies today. I went to Pizza Hut for supper with my parents which was an interesting experience as usual.  Well that's all for now

      I had a French exam and a math exam on Monday and they both went very well. After that me and Bethany went to East Side Marios, to the mall and then to see The Butterfly Effect, it was a good move.  Today I didn't do much but I did watch Big Daddy and I remembered how funny it was! I don't really have much planned for this week considering I don't have any school all week. I'll probably stay home with my dad and watch television and movies and maybe hang out with some people. Well I have to get back to my movie now so see ya!

      Yesterday night Lindsay and Elyse slept over and we watched some television and movies and talked. I (well Adam) made some changes to my blogger for me and I'm happy with them.  I would just like to say to Adam that if he does not like the way that I spell he shouldn't come on my site and write out the proper grammar because I don't go on his and make fun of him.  Who is this Kevin person that left me a shout out? I have two exams on Monday in French and Math and I'm really not looking forward to them.  Thursday was the last day of first semester which is good because I won't have to deal with Ms.Janess or Ms.Sheridan anymore! Well keep leaving me shout outs!

      It was actually an ok trip to Montreal this time!We started out in Oakville were we partied a little and then the next day we left for Montreal. The day we got there we went to my uncle and aunts house and we just talked and stuff...then we went to my grandmothers house and we ate pizza. The next day I went to the mall and we saw the Mainvilles there. Then that night I went to go see Cold Mountain with Simon and Patrick...it was a really good movie. The next day was New Years (I think) so I went to my aunts house and then we went to my cousins old house because we know the people who bought it and we celebrated new years there. There was a big Foosball tournament and me and this exchange student from Japan (whos name was Emma) won the entire thing!then the next day was my grandmothers birthday so we all got together at my aunts house and had a little party. The next day I stayed with my aunt and uncle again and I went to go see Cheaper by the Dozen and we ate supper at Bar-B-Barn. The next day was a mass at the church for my Grandfather because its been a year since he passed away. After the mass there was a sort of gathering at my grandmothers house so we all hung out and said bye to everyone that we wont see for a while. Today we left Montreal and we brought Simon back with us because we had to stop off in Oakville anyway....so I had to sit in between Simon and Adam all the way home because Tali had her friend in the back with her and she was being a baby so she made me sit in the middle. Well that was my entire trip! (HAPPY BIRTHDAY LINDSAY)

      Well it's been a pretty long week. It started out with a gym project due on Tuesday, an English test on Wednesday, a science test on Thursday and a history test on Friday.  The weekend has been going good so far. Friday Natalija and her friend came home and they picked me up from school and then I went to the mall and to see the movie "Monster" with Bethany and Lindsay Parrott.  Then today I went to Bethany's house and we went to Bayside mall and walked around downtown for a while. Tomorrow me and Elyse are going to get together and do stuff and Adam is coming home! This should be an interesting week with Natalija being home. Richard Hatch got voted off Survivor All Stars so I think Adam is mad about that! I can't wait until next week to see what Sue is going to yell about!

      Well this weekend was pretty good! Adam came home and I bought a game cube. Adam, Mike and I went to a sting game and to crabby joe's. It was good.  The next day we went to the states and I got a new shirt. Elyse came over that night and we played Mario Party 4 for a while. Sunday I really didn't do anything at all. Today was an ok day! I have some homework though.

      Well yesterday was Friday the 13 but I didn't have too much bad luck! I went to see 50 First Dates with Steph, Lindsay and Bethany yesterday and it was really good. We also went to the mall and to McDonalds and we saw Andre and Allen and some other kids from our school so that was funny. Today I'm probably going to spend some time with my parents and eat a lot of candy!

      According to Mme.Kennifick I don't work do my work to my potential, whatever that means. Well today was a much better day! English has gotten to be a really fun class, but history still sucks. Science is one of the funniest classes because I sit in between Elyse and Kathleen. Elyse is always doing some pretty crazy like ripping pages out of her science text book.  Gym is still fun because we played Volley-ball against the grade nines! I think this weekend we're going to Oakville and to visit Tali and Adam so that'll be fun!

      Looks like Maika left me a shout out, sorry I don't mention you much. Last night Elyse came over to watch Survivor with us. It was awesome.  Natalija left today (thank god!) I don't think that I could have taken much more of her. Well that's really all that's new for now so I'll be going now.

      Yesterday I bought an acoustic guitar at Pickers Alley! Then Elyse came over and we watched some old episodes of Survivor to get pumped up for Survivor all-stars which starts tonight after the super bowl. I've been trying to learn how to play some songs on my new guitar all morning and I'm in the process of learning Life by Our Lady Peace, it's going alright. Natalija is home until tomorrow so that's always interesting. Well that's about it for now!

      I forgot to say that the other day me and my mom were splitting a Kit Kat bar when we noticed that the crunchy center was not there! It was just pure chocolate! We both didn't know what to do. I thought that was an interesting story! I got a needle yesterday and my arm still hurts, but at least I didn't pass out like some people I know (Adam). Dad put the toilet in the washroom today and it's looking alright now!

      School sucks as usual. The first day back in Kennefick's class, a whole bunch of us (i.e. Bethany, Elyse, Emily, Kathleen, Michelle, Lauren, Mallory, Kelsey and I) were all put in the hall for speaking English, which is stupid because class hadn't even started yet. This happens all the time but this time she was serious. She came out and started yelling at us and told us to go find another teacher because we were never allowed in her class again. Then she kept coming out and back in until we were all really confused.  Emily asked her what we should do and Kennefick said she didn't care and that it was our problem and then she came back out and told us to get back in class so we all didn't know what was going on. I had a run in with Mr.McArtur (My study hall teacher who thinks I have a crush on him) and it was really awkward. He was standing at the front of the room and  me and Bethany started laughing so he really thinks I'm in love with him. That's really all that's happened so far this week but there's still plenty more to come!

      Well March Break is officially over :(. Back to school tomorrow. I didn't do much today but I went shopping with my mom. Today will be my first home cooked meal all week. I usually eat pizza. Well there isn't really much new around here.

      Yesterday was by far the best day (or night) of March Break!!!It was awesome!I'm still spending all my days with Bethany and Nicole Lumley. Today me,Beth,Nicole and Bethany's cousin Lindsay went to the mall and we saw Michelle and Emily, we talked for a while and then saw Tiffany and then we saw Cody Cook. It was interesting!

      Since March Break started I've been watching three episodes of the Cosby Show a day and now I'm hooked on it! I've been spending most of my time with Bethany, just hanging out and going to the mall. My dad is still doing work on the bathroom and I still don't like it that much but it is looking better then it was when he first started. I only had one shout out last time I posted and that makes me mad because you people tell me to update my site and then don't even come on and leave me shout outs, yes Adam I know that you left me one, but still, I think you guys should all leave me some!

      March break is here so I've been busy. Yesterday I slept over at Bethany's house and then we walked around downtown for a while. Today I haven't really done much, I've been watching movies like Three To Tango and Getting There (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). I'm just waiting around for people to call me. Lindsay Parrott aka the Paper Parrott is in France right now so I'm jealous of her. We've been spending time with Nicole Lumley recently which is new and exciting.  Yesterday we went to Snap Dragon to see the guy that everyone likes and he talked to me so Nicole was jealous.  Dad's been working on the bathroom for a while and I have to say that I don't really like it all that much yet, but it's not finished so I'm sure it'll look better once everything is done.

      Well nothing is new at all around here. It's been a pretty long and hectic week. It seems that I have something due at school every single day! It's kinda boring around here so I don't have much to do!

      So nothing is new at all! I just thought I'd write about nothing. School is the same as always. Adam is coming home tonight and Natalija is here, all we need is Maika and we have the entire family under one roof again. It's already pretty crazy around here but I'm sure when Adam comes it'll get even more bizzaro. Well that's really all there is to say.

      My grandparents are here! They just showed up here when Tali was home alone. Nothing else is really that new around here though. Just been doing the same old thing every morning. School has gotten a lot better because we never really do anything. Last weekend I went to see 13 going on 30 and I thought it was a good movie! I recommend it to everyone. May is going to be a good month because I go to Ottawa, Maika comes home, I go to an imax science trip, it's Elyse's, Mark's and Bethany's birthdays and I get a day off on may 24! Well that's really all that has been going on around here!

      Well nothing is that new around here, same old, same old. I've just been doing the normal school stuff. I did get new shoes which is an interesting turn of events...not really.  I got red Converse shoes. Well I think that's really all I have to say for now because my life is not really that interesting.

      I just thought that I should write down what I think the best line in a movie ever is: Sally: Dickie when I hear you talk all I think is; brick wall waterfall Dickie thinks he's got it all, but you don't and I do, so boom with that attitude, peace punch capn' crunch I got something you can't touch, reeses pieces 7up you mess with me, I'll mess you up!

      Well it's been a very eventful Easter weekend so I haven't been on the computer much. I watched a lot of movies: Thirteen, Bring it on Again, Dickie Roberts, School of Rock, A very Brady Sequel, Honey we shrunk ourselves, Zoolander, Gothika, Armageddon, Duplex, Can't hardly Wait. I think there were more but I don't recall them right now. We all decorated Easter eggs, and we ate a rabbit shaped cake. Easter morning I woke up to see the the Easter bunny had been there and he left me lots of chocolate. Me and Adam woke up and went downstairs but Tali was to sick to come. Adam, mom, dad and I all went to church but we didn't see Mr.St.Louis. I did shake father Len's hand and wished him a Happy Easter. We also rejoiced at the Queen of Dairy with some nice Blizzards. Today at school it wasn't that eventful but I did get to read Lord of the Flies.

      Another time something weird happened to me! I was eating a twinkie and there was no cream filling. I took a bite and turned to who I was with (I don't remember) and said "Hey where's the cream filling?" Today was an ok day. I had part of an ISU do and that sucked and I had a first aid test to do in gym. I also got to play basketball in gym!It was really fun! I got the first basket for my team which was pretty cool. That's really all that happened today so far.

      Yes I did eat the Kit Kat anyways. I was going to save it and show everyone but I really wanted chocolate. I haven't been at school for a while because I've been sick!That's really all I wanted to say for now.

      Well Ottawa was definitely the best trip I've ever had in my life. We went to a whole bunch of museums and broke some rules in all of them. I hung out with a lot of new people which was also fun. I just got back yesterday and I got my pictures this afternoon so I've been looking at them and there are some funny ones of Kara, Melissa and Jenna. We went to the Hard Rock Cafe and told them it was my birthday so it was pretty funny. We also went to Hooters and that was interesting because as soon as we got there the other bus pulled up and a whole bunch of other people showed up so it was all people from our school in there.

      Well I haven't written for a very long time so I decided it would be a good time. This weekend we went to Toronto again to pick up Maika from the airport and then to the Mainville's house for a while. It was a good trip. I can't stand this family anymore though so it will be good to go to Ottawa tomorrow to get some time away from them. Today a hypnotist came to our school and that was really funny. Tomorrows trip should definitely be really good!

      Yesterdays trip was good. I had to carry the casket which was new. We saw everyone and it took us around two hours to say bye. Then we came back here and went to sleep. This morning I went to the mall with Bethany and her brothers Scott and Phil. Then I came home and I'm watching the Mighty Ducks 3 so I'm having a good time. Tonight I might hang out with Bethany but I'm not sure yet. Well that's all for now.

      Well nothing much is new around here. We have to go to Toronto tomorrow for a funeral. My mom's uncle died. It'll be a long trip considering we have to leave at around 5:00 in the morning. School was a joke today because nobody was there. Survivor was good again today I guess. The rest of the month is going to be awesome because I have a science trip, Maika will be home and I'm going to Ottawa. Well that's really all for now!

      I would like people to start calling me Boston Ema. I just figure that if Boston Rob can pull it off so can I, even though as some people point out I don't live in Boston. I bought the first season of Gilmore Girls on DVD so I've been pretty busy watching that for the past few days. School has been the same recently. Nothing else is really that new. Adam and dad are trying to build something in the backyard over the "deck" thing, but I don't really get it. There is a rugby game tomorrow so I have to be ready to start serving the water again. I don't know if I mentioned this but I am the new water girl for the team!

      Well this week has been pretty good so far, considering it just started. This weekend started out with the night spent a Mackenzie's house. Jill, Bradi, Bethany, Kate and I all helped Mackenzie with her garage sale. The next day I went to see New York Minute with Bethany. Then Sunday was mother's day and we went to the mall and out for supper. We're still doing Tae Kwon Do in gym class so that's always fun....At the end of the weak we have to break a board. Maika is coming home in 11 days! That should be another good trip. Amber won survivor! I was happy with the end result but I would have liked it more if Boston Rob had won because I liked him. Then in the reunion show Boston Rob proposed to Amber!!! It was an awesome season. Last Thursday was the last episode of Friends...EVER!!! It was an ok ending but they could have made it a lot better in my opinion. In the end Ross and Rachel got together, Joey got a duck and a chick, Phoebe did nothing and Chandler and Monica adopted twins. They could have ended it in Central Perk but they ended it focusing on Monica's door which was a little stupid. Well that's it for now!

      Yesterday I started the day by watching Romey and Michele's High School Reunion and then Kill Bill. They are both very good movies. I've come to the conclusion that either there's a ghost in my house or I'm crazy, and I don't mean that I'm crazy as in wow you're crazy but I mean I think I am seriously going insane! I'm starting to hear things. I tend to hear things mostly at night. School was good today. We did the usual. That's all for now!

      This weekend was ok. We started out on Friday night by driving to Toronto to bring Tali to the airport. We went to Red Lobster and then we went to the hotel and rented Stuck on You. Then we all went to "sleep" at around 12:00. Only mom and dad really got any sleep because we had to wake up at 3:30am. My mom snores quite a bit so Adam, Natalija and I never really got any sleep. Then we left for the airport and Tali's friend wasn't there so she was freaking out. Adam and I wasted the time by watching a couple of Chinese people trying to pack their suitcase. Then we said bye to Tali and her friend finally showed up. We left and went back to the hotel and slept for a little while before we left for Sarnia. When we got back here Bethany called me and we went to the mall and to see Mean Girls with Lindsay Parrott. Then I came back here and watched Saturday Night Live and then went to bed. Today I think all I'm going to do is watch television and do some homework. Oh yeah and on Friday at school we tried to beat the world record for the most people playing Leap Frog at a single place but we lost by 28 people! It was an outrage, surprisingly Leap Frog has a lot of rules and it can be very tiring after 6 minutes. Well that's really all!

      Last night I went to the mall and the movies with Lindsay Parrott. We went and saw The Terminal and then we saw the Day After Tomorrow. The reason we saw two movies is because it was still really early and Lindsay paid for me because she owed me money. Then I came back here and watched For Love of Money and Who Wants to Marry my Dad? with Maika and then we watched Joe Schmo 2. I know what happens before Adam does. Keep on Keepin' on.

      Yesterday night we also watched How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days. I love that movie! Tonight I might be hanging out with Lindsay Parrot and going to see a movie, that's all I ever do because there's nothing else to do around here. I tutored today for an hour and a half and it was ok. Then I came home and watched Dawson's Creek with Maika and Adam and then I ate Zoodles and came down here to write an entry. That's all for now.

      It was a day spent with Maika. First I woke up and Maika and I went to the mall and she bought one of those bracelets with the little charm link things. Then we walked around for like an hour and looked for charms to put on it and then she finally decided to go back to the place we were at in the begging. Then we came home and watched Say It Isn't So and then ate supper. Then Maika and I went to see The Notebook. It was a sad yet happy movie. Now I'm home and I might watch that episode of Joe Schmo Two that I missed thanks to Adam not taping it! Smell ya later...

      Well nothing is going on around here. I've just been watching movies with Maika and Adam....mainly Maika because last night we watched Princess Diaries and Josie and the Pussycats. Tomorrow I have to tutor again, which I'm not looking forward to. The kid doesn't need a tutor he's going into grade one.  I just hope the mom realizes that but then again if I don't tutor this kid I will have absolutely no money this summer because I already owe Adam $50.00. I don't think I'll be doing anything constructive this summer. There really isn't anything I can do I guess. Keep on truckin'

      I've been looking at other peoples blogs for the past two days and I've noticed that they all write a lot more than I do each time they write an entry....is it because their lives are more interesting than mine????Probably...  Nothing is new around here. Maika worked today, Adam watched Dawsons Creek and I woke up around 11:00. My mom started her vacations today so I guess the party is over. It used to be just me, Adam and Maika. I haven't done much this morning and I probably won't do anything all day. I don't even know why I bothered getting dressed this morning, it's just a waist of clean clothes. I'm watching La Bamba right now. I know what's going to happen in the end but I don't remember ever seeing everything leading up to that horrifying moment when Ritchie goes down in the plane. It's a sad movie. Well that's really all that I have to say I guess.....

      Well I started tutoring and it's going well so far. The kid is nice and he's also from England so that's a plus! I got Joe Schmo on dvd so that's pretty much all me and Adam have been watching for the past two days. It's still as funny as it was the first time I watched it. I went to see the Stepford Wives with Mackenzie, Bethany and Lindsay the other day and the movie was creepy. Maikas been working for the past few days so we haven't been hanging out that much recently. I was sick this morning and last night so that really sucks.

      Joe Shmo two started yesterday and it's off to an amazing start.  They have two people this time and it seems to be working out good, but the girl has already started to figure it out. She said she felt like she was on the Truman Show (that movie where Jim Carry doesn't know that his whole life is just a fake TV show). Tonight the Simple Life Two and Newly Weds are on, so it should be a great night. I had my English exam today and it went alright so that's one down and two to go.

      i just thought I should post one of my favorite quotes ever: Well, um, actually a pretty nice little Saturday, we're going to go to Home Depot. Yeah, buy some wallpaper, maybe get some flooring, stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath, & Beyond, I don't know, I don't know if we'll have enough time.

      Well nothing is too new with me. I did get my yearbook today and I must say that it is a disappointment. It has some sort of monopoly man/board game theme. I'm only in one picture as usual considering I'm not popular enough to make in every single picture like some people. They also seem to make a lot of spelling errors concerning people's names. That's really all that's happened. I should probably start studying for exams but I don't think I will until the night before. Today in gym we went to the beach, but a whole bunch of us went off to the animal farm and then we all went to the ice cream store so that was fun. I've been filling out applications and giving in resumes to certain places and I really hope that I at least get one interview or one sign that I am qualified to do a job in Sarnia. The WB superstar USA season finale is on tonight so that should defiantly make for an interesting evening! I love that show, but not as much as Joe Shmoe which will be starting soon as well.

      Baseball was interesting today. Once again I played third base. Leah and I ended up getting two people out by working as a team. She threw it to me and I actually caught it! Nothing else is really that new around here.

      Well nothing much is new around here but I think it was time to update my site. Maika's home and so is Adam so it;s interesting having two more people around. Some British woman called and now I'm going to tutor her son in French, that should make for an interesting time. All of my friends are doing stuff like working and crap but it kinda reminds me of the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. Then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Well that's really all for now!

      Today in gym class we had to play baseball, and I must say that Leah deserves the title of mvp. We were talking and the ball came right for us so she bent down and it went right through her legs. Besides that school was the usual...Boring. Well that's really all.

      Yesterday evening we went to the Veriker's house for Paul's birthday party. It was fun. We buried Adam and had hamburgers on the barbecue for supper. Then we came home. This morning I woke up and played playstation and then I really didn't do anything all day. Yesterday was too much excitement for me. I also lost at mini golf yesterday. Maika was first, Adam was second, Dad was third and I lost.

Today also happens to be the day of Paul Veriker's 50 birthday party so&nbsp;I think we might be going there instead&nbsp;of the movie. Those are the plans for today.&nbsp;

      Well today Adam and I went to go see Finger Eleven at Bayfest. It was a good concert. Then we came home and ate supper and I took a shower because it rained at the concert. We also went to the mall for like two minutes so I could buy some wrist bands at West 49. Tomorrow we're (Mom, Adam and I) are off to Montreal for the week well Maika and Dad stay here and work. I probably won't be leaving any posts for a while but it's not like it matters because Adam is the only one who has been leaving any shout outs for me and he's coming with me!

      Yesterday I went to the mall with Bethany and then I went to her house. At the mall we saw some paramedic, so we decided to follow them and there was a girl on the ground. They were giving her oxygen and they put her on a stretcher. That was all the excitement that we had at the mall. At Bethany's house we ate pizza and watched television. That was really it for the day.

      Yesterday after Maika was done working we went to Wall-Mart and then out for supper. After that we drove around for a bit and then we went to see Fahrenheit 911. It was a good movie, it was really funny. I tutored this morning and it was the same as always. I'm not doing much for the rest of the day but watch movies. I hope the rest of my week is more interesting!

      Well I didn't hang out with Bethany and Lindsay Parrott because I went to the US of A with Maika, dad and mom. I didn't buy anything because I had no money. Mom bought me some chocolates called Swoops that look like Pringles but are really just chocolate. Maika bought some charms and mom bought her chocolate too. Then we went to Swiss Chalet for supper. We saw Romas Otto and talked to him for a while and now I'm at home and we're going to watch Big Fish. Adam went to a wedding so he isn't here.

I'm also hanging out with Bethany and Lindsay Parrott and we're going to the mall and to go see a movie. That is really all that's going on.

      Last night Maika and I watched Cheaper by the Dozen (thanks to Steve) and we also watched For Love or Money and Who Wants to Marry my Dad. It was the last episode of For Love or Money and Preston picked PJ and she didn't pick the money. Then I watched Joe Schmo 2. They introduced a new girl Amanda as the new Jane Schmo because Ingrid figured it out. Now Ingrid is one of the actresses on the show too!This morning I woke up and tutored Mitch. It was the usual except for today it only lasted an hour. Then I came home watched Dawson's Creek with Maika and then we went to the mall and we ate lunch and bought another link for Maika's bracelet. Now I'm at home watching Oprah and waiting for Elyse to call. Tonight Amazing Race and Big Brother are on which will be a night well spent!

He sent us: Along came Polly, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Shrek 2, 50 First Dates, Cold Mountain, Haunted Mansion, The Miracle, Kill Bill Volume 2, Chicago, Legally Blond 2, Cheaper by the Dozen and I'm pretty sure there were more but I can't remember them right now. Tonight there is the usual line up of For Love or Money, Who wants to marry my Dad and Joe Schmo 2. Then it's off to bed because I have to tutor tomorrow.

We saw some cool floats and then we saw Joshua from Canadian Idol. I saw some of my friends and talked to them for a while and then Adam and I talked to Mme.Kennefick for a while! Tonight we're going to the fireworks and to a BBQ at the Lapp's house. Peace!

We also saw Michelle, Kathleen, Kate, Fiona, Jill and Kevin at the theater. After the movie Bethany, Lindsay Parrott and I went to Tim Hortons. Then Bethany came over and we watched Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

      Well I had a super fun happy time! The trip started out with Maika and I in the car listening to some good Disney classics. We went to like four different malls and I bought some stuff and so did she. Then we went to a nice fancy dinner at Chuck E. Cheese, where I stole some tickets and broke two games. Then we picked up Brad and his brother and Brad told us that he wasn't going to coming with us to Wonderland! We were all very upset with this decision but in the long run it was really his loss. We all went to Zellers to visit Allison. Then we went and picked up Brad's friend. Then when Allison got off work we all went out for Krispy Kreme and got some donuts. Then we went for a swim in Allison's pool and slept at her house. The next morning we woke up nice and early and left to pick up Maika's French friend Jessey who was coming to Wonderland with us. When we finally got there (Some minor stops to meet a guy name Sunny and stuff like that) Maika had to do the double kiss on the cheek thing, which me and Allison avoided. Then we got to Wonderland and had the greatest time EVER!!!! We went on a lot of rides and had such an awesome time, it's just too bad that Brad missed out. Now Maika is mad at Brad. Today we drove Maika to the airport to leave for Malaysia. Then we went out for supper at the Big Boy restaurant. It was good times.

I am now sitting at home. Tomorrow Maika and I are going to Waterloo and the next day we are going to Wonderland with Brad and Allison and some of Maika's other friends.
