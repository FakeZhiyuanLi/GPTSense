       Yeah I'm watching Sex and the City, and yeah I'm one of those bored pathetic geeks who stays up until 3 or&nbsp;4 doing absolutely nothing other than staring at the screen.  &nbsp;  Talked to my mum the other day, she asked how things going over here, I said in my best oh don't worry mum voice that everything's great, she just said, "You know what you're doing, you always do."&nbsp; Do i?? At the moment no I don't really.  &nbsp;  It's been a long time since I left home. Ordinary teenage girl wants to leave home. Well by that time I had my own reasons but it doesn't matter now. Who cares anyway.  &nbsp;  Right... ex and the city. I get to speak to my ex today, he's obviously doing much better than me and the most shocking news is that he still speaks to my mum. How nice. He's a very nice bloke, he's got everything that a girl would look in a chap. He's gentle, considerate, sporty, a non-smoker, tall, smart, loving, caring, good looking, hard working, blah blah blah. For once I thought I must've done something really really extraordinary to deserve him. We shared everything, we talked all the time, we laughed, we cried. He's so protective towards me that sometimes did annoy me a little bit. He's always holding my hand wherever we go, he never left me out in a group of friends or in a party, he's always saying something sweet, we&nbsp;went out almost everynight, romantic dinners, cinemas, gigs, there's no end of nights out and we went Thailand, Taiwan, China together.  &nbsp;  Somehow I thought I'll be with him for the rest of my life. But it all ends. Not anybody's fault, it just happens that I was leaving&nbsp;HongKong and I don't think it'll be fair for him to wait. We had long talks about the whole thing, he offered to come with me, I thought about not going. Lots of considerations, I left. For the sake of studies. More frankly for the desire of a new place to live in, for a change. I can't see myself&nbsp; living in the same place for more than 3 years. I've always been moving since I was young. I get to know lots of people but I don't have the time to get close to them. Well there are a few true friends back in HongKong that I really really miss, if for any reason I want to go back, it will be for my friends.  &nbsp;  But can we be friends with our ex? I don't think so. I just find it so absurd to be friends with someone that we slept with. However for this guy, I think I can. Not because I still love him but just the fact that he is probably the best person I've ever met on this planet. Better than anyone else. I could almost feel myself as a bad person when I was standing next to him. &nbsp;  I remember the last thing he said to me, "Thanks for being with me for so long Annie, I love you to bits but if this is where you want to go, I wish you well and please take good care of yourself. If you found someone please let me know and please be sure that he can take care of you. I wish you'd stay happy in the rest of your life. You've been really nice to me, thank you." A long kiss in the airport and that's how I left HongKong. As usual, no one from my family cared.  &nbsp;  14 hours flight, I think I must've been crying for at least 3 hours on the plane. I'm heading to a brand new place on the other side of the world. With his words playing in my mind, I finally fell asleep.  &nbsp;  I don't know what to write now really. He was the one I loved and it's funny how things change. Now I put all my love onto someone else and he's still alone. Could he be waiting for me like he said he would? Or just that he's too busy with his work? I don't know.   &nbsp;
