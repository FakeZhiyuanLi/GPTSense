       Tired, tired, tired. Woke up around 11:00am. I was supposed to be at SLA (buy books) at 11:00am. So got ready as fast as I could, because the book sale was going to close at 12:00p.m. I couldn't go get the books from 1:00p.m. - 3:00p.m. because of my basketball game. But all is good --got there around 11:30p.m. The only juniors I saw were Sam and Stephanie. Lots of freshmen. $288 bucks for books. WTF mate?       The Good News:   I HAVE A FULL LOCKER! Sweet MONKEYS!       We lost the bball game. BUT ALL IS sexy, because I scored 6 points --that's what counts. lmao. Went swimming after the game at the YMCA with my cousins. fun crap! I'm so funking tired. night . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .. .. .. . ..

       I had to get new pants for school today. I'm just growing like bamboo. Dockers all the way home doggy dodo. So gangSTER - I know. I also had to get some basketball pants. I tried on these black shorts, and they were very cozy, but then I looked in the mirror, and they were see through -bad bad idea.     Had basketball practice today. It's been a while, with vacation and all. One of my teamates dyed his hair pink for some reason. Everyone got a kick out of that. Gots a game tomorrow. Going to kick some ass!      Rented "Johnson Family Vacation." Kind of reminds me of my road trip to Canada, cept we didn't pick up a pyscho voo-doo hot girl hitchhiker that steals Fruit-Loop boxes. ha ha. night man/dudes/dudedetts (spelled wrong)/chicks/chickens/the homeless/Lindsay...yeah I'm done. NIGHT!

       Went to Office Depot (why don't they pronounce the "t?") today, to get some school supplies. I went to the Office Depot in Mountain View because the one near me is evil, and unorganized, so I have no idea where anything is. MOTHER! School starts in exactly a week. ah! Why must summer go to the beyond? Also played some b-ball at the park. I'm getting better. I bought 2 locker shelves at Office Depot because they break to easy. Also walked to Walgreens, and on the way there these Asians near Tin-Tin Market were doing Tai-Chi or something. Really interesting. I tried copying them from a distance, didn't work out that well. ha ah ha ha.       Tomorrow I'm going to see a clown midget! She's very odd, she's tries to ryme everything! And sometimes the sentences turn out wrong. Don't ask. Well ask if your dying to know, which you all should be!!! ASK!      I'm going to watch the "Bend it like Bekham" movie again. night

       School...not that excited about it.       The highLIGHT of my day was going to a moooovie with Moogan. Went to see "Princess Diaries Dos." Total chick flick. ahhhhhhhh! Some parts were funny though. ha. Moogan was 15 minutes late getting to the theatre. women........ I wanted to see Collateral, but it was rated R. And people over at AMC14 actually   care,   and ask for ID's. After we walked around. We some how walked into a furniture store and almost broke some stuff (well I almost broke stuff). Lamps cost so much now-a-days; $212 for a funking lamp??       Watched "Bend it like Beckham." Best Indian/English/Scottish/?Russian? movie I've ever seen. I'm going to bed. I have no idea what I'm going to do tomorrow. :)

       Today was my very first time at the Great Mall!!! I must say that it is 'great' because it has almost everything - like a moooooooooovie theatre. I called Jason around 8:00a.m. to awaken him, and of course he didn't wake up until around 9:00a.m. Have I ever told anyone that I can't take the bus by myself, because my mom thinks its unsafe (WTF mate)? Very embarrassing. And Jason lives so far away, and no one wants to drive me. So what I had to do was meet him at PGA (Paramonts Great America), my dad drove me there. Then once I got there I'd meet Jason (which took 2 light rails to meet me) and take the light rail to the Great Mall with him. ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To many things of public tranportation, and parents driving. GOD!! I had fun though.. Played at Cyber Cafe most of the time. Awesome stuff. After, went to his house (took another light rail) and chilled like an ice cube.       Tomorrow I'm going to go see a movie with Moogan!       MY CELL PHONE WORKS!!!! Finally! ....night!

       ah, Monday! Today was almost close to being boring. Let's see, what did I do today? Woke up around 10a.m. Talked on thy phone for a long time...that's rare. Went to the library to renew some DVDs, and got some weird books. I walked to the library, it's the one near Calabazeas Park. I thought it was far, but ehh, it's not that bad of a walk. So on the way back home I stopped at Walgreens to get a C2. lol. I think C2 is the best coke, taste so freakin' good. I was looking in the candy section when I noticed a Rolling Stones magazine. And guess who was on the front cover?? Lindsay-POO! So I bought it just because Lindsay was on it. There's this picture of her sitting on ice, and it's very sexy. ha. ha. ha. ha. She was wearing only underware on the bottom. I wonder how she kept a straight face? Then walked over to Eaton to practice basketball, but all the courts were filled up. How crappppp is that? So walked back home and listened to "Too Young," by PHOENIX. That song makes me dance like a crazy mother. Played poker with the family. My mom actually won.       Tomorrow I'm going to the Great Mall with some friends. I've never been to the Great Mall. Jason said, "WOW, I've never meet anyone that hasn't been to the Great Mall besides you." I replied, "Yeah it's sad." I used the word 'replied'. I'm sounding like a book.

        Thursday - Saturday    awahhaahahah! It feels good to be back at a site where I can go to the bathroom in peace. So for those of you that didn't know; I went camping in Tahoe for three days (Thursday - Saturday). So overall my first camping exprience was ok. It's the getting there and back; long long drive that's crap. So when we arrived Lisa and I escaped fastly so we didn't have to set up the tent. Lisa's family and another family with us did that. We headed to the Lake Tahoe, Pope Beach. The funny thing is we took a trail that lead us into mud, tall grass, and bushes. There were lots of bugs on the trail, and I didn't get bit..hahaahah! Surpising. We finally made it to the beach and we're debating whether to swim in it or not because we didn't have our bathing suits on. But all-of-a-sudden this random guy tackles Lisa in the lake...soooo that kind of decided the whole swimming issue. So we went swimming in Lake Tahoe with our regular cloths on (underware included). The guy that tackled Lisa said he got paid $45 dollars to tackle someone. Then the next day we played my invented game, "Beach Hockey." It's where you get hockey sticks and a ball that floats on water...and just play hockey, only on water that's not frozen. And then on Sunday we went walking and took pictures. So it was fun. OOOOh, and we found this abandon house and we tried to get in. It kinda worked. ha. Also played poker. I won $21 dollars. SWEET!       Sunday    Went to church. Ate breakfast. Went to sleep again. I got a new cell of phone, because T-mobile sucks mother! But today we had to go back to verizon store, because something got screwed up with my phone. I can make outgoing calls, but I can't get incoming calls. My dad got the cell phones when I was gone, and he said this problem has been going on since he got them on Thursday so if it doesn't work by tomorrow, then were going to Cingular. hah. Then went to visit my grandmoo. She's very interesting. "Kill Bill 2" and the sexy Lindsay Lohan + Rachael McAdams movie "Mean Girls" comes out this week. HOW AWESOME IS THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm going crazzy. night!    *5 minutes later* I just found out that "Mean Girls" doesn't come out until 9/21/2004...all well!

      Hello. Let's see today was interesting. Umm. I woke up around 11a.m. Watched the boob-tube for a while. Then got my classes in the mail. DUDE! Took forever to make and mail the schedules out. Mitty got theirs a month ago. Go figure - St. Lawrence. I have no electives, very sad. For dinner I had Quiznos. Good stuff.  Did I ever mention in my xanga what I did for my summer job? I guess I didn't. Ok so in June, I wanted a job really bad. So I applied for this hotel, Cypress. They never called so I had to go into the hotel and ask for the boss person. So we talked and he said that there's no positions open. So after that conversation my mom treated me out Quiznos that day. While we were eating I saw the boss of Quiznos dance in this cup custom. And I said to my mom, "I could do that." So Song (boss of Quiznos) came inside I went up to him and said, "Do you need help advertising?" He was like, "YES YES yes yes YESSSS." So I got the job. I got paid $8 an hour. I got paid "under the table." So I worked for about a month and a half, until one day they called and said that the city of Cupertino says there is a law against "animated advertising." So I couldn't work anymore. But it was actually good because the week I lost my job was the week I left for vacation. So I made good money. Stupid Cupertino. What kind of law is that? Pisses me off. OOh and today I was in the Cupertino newspaper. It's about how Cupertino having this stupid law, and how everybody loved the dancing cup. I'm so proud. BUT hey, I look on the bright side. Now I can say my first job was a Quiznos dancing cup. :)  Wow, I'm going camping tomorrow. I'll be back Saturday. Should be fun. Were are going to play poker some of the time. I will kick ass, and win!  Also today I went to Eaton to practice shooting hoops. And there were a group of other people playing, and they invited me to play. It was fun. lol.  Well I'm off to pack. Catch you later homies!

      Well the day is ending and it's getting closer and closer to camping. I wonder if were going to make fire with sticks, that would be interesting. If I had to make the fire, I'd cheat and bring gas and matches, but I'd probably start a forest fire...and bears would die! We don't want that to happen.  Played basketball. I must say I've improved in the past day. Can't wait until I'm actually good enough to join the NBA. *coughs and dies of laughter*  I'm off to watch a mooooovie. "Minority Report."

      Yo, my home skillut biscuits  /slash/  cookies  /slash/  oven products. Yeah, anyways. Today has been a lazy day. I didn't do that much besides sleep, eat, and movies. I love those kind of days when you don't have to worry aboot school work, and you can be a potato of a couch. Don't get that many days, so enjoy.  I think I'm going to go play basketball soon...  I need to go see "The Village." Looks unpeaceful. I'm going to be going camping in 2 days. I hope it doesn't suck like when you just realize there's no more toilet paper after you've done your drop of the bombs. Has that ever happened to you? *bad memory* What does one bring while going camping? hmm..  I'll write later. bupbye!!

       I woke up at 8:00a.m. Yes, yes, I know - How could I? I was actually joyful because I thought I was going to get my braces of today. That's the reason why I woke up early..k, yeah. So I was late getting there. And to my surprise the dentist comes up and says, "Guess what?" I'm like, "What?" He's said "Your going to have your braces for another month." I mean he said with such excitement that I felt like slapping the bastard. So that ruined my day.       hmmm....what else did I do today? ah yess...      Went to the local LI of BRARY to renew my 5 freakin' books that I have to read for AP English. Why the hell I am in AP? *pounds head* Then played basketball..and rented lots of movies. THE END!           "  I hate braces!  "
