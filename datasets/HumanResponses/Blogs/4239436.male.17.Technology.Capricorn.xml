      The Windows platform started a while ago, but by far, has made so much progress and improvements since the good 'ol Windows 3.1, not to mention DOS.    So, I have dedicated this blog as appreciation and informational to the people that use Windows. Yes, I know, there's always Linux, and may I add...there will be a Linux blog soon...but for now, let's stay with the majority...  urlLink continued story...

      CSS has really changed web styles. It not only saves time, but you can customize your webpage color schemes to a higher extent. You can also create more professional looking websites just by adding styles to your documents. Today, I will show you a webmaster trick that uses CSS by applying mouseover styles that change as the mouse "rolls" over a table's background.     Explanation #1:  Alot of newbies don't know how to do this and so many people have asked me how to do this too, so I've decided to make a tutorial on it. What is suppose to happen is, when you place your mouse over a table row, the style should change to another style you have defined in what we will call " styles.css " (external stylesheet).   Create a new file in Notepad and save it as "styles.css":       td.On { background: #FF8A00; FONT-FAMILY: verdana; COLOR: #FFFFFF; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10px; } td.Off { background: #0056a2; FONT-FAMILY: verdana; COLOR: #FFFFFF; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10px; }       Explanation #2:  									 Now that you have your stylesheet you may link it to your html document like so:     &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;   &lt;link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;   &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;   &lt;table border="1" width="100%" bordercolor="#1C464F"&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/table&gt;         Explanation #3:  Okay, go get some coffee or something worth while to drink, then come back...WELCOME BACK! Now back to work, the next thing we must do now is create the table like so (without the styles implemented):      &lt;table border="1" width="100%" bordercolor="#1C464F"&gt; &lt;tr> &lt;td>The dog ran the race.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;But the cat won.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;       Explanation #4:  Now you may implement the styles. Note that becasue you attached the stylesheet as and external stylesheet, you can just add the 'class' attribute to your HTML tags and your styles will show up. THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC IS! What you do is you add the code  onmouseover="this.className='on'"  and  onmouseout="this.className='off'"  to make the tables change as the mouse rolls over each row:     &lt;table border="1" width="100%" bordercolor="#1C464F"&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="off" onmouseover="this.className='on'" onmouseout="this.className='off'"&gt; The dog ran the race.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="off" onmouseover="this.className='on'" onmouseout="this.className='off'"&gt; But the cat won.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;      Putting It Together:  Now as it is pieced together your HTML document should look something like this:     &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;    &lt;link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   &lt;table border="1" width="100%" bordercolor="#1C464F"&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td class="Off" onmouseover="this.className='On'" onmouseout="this.className='Off'"&gt; The dog ran the race.        &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td class="Off" onmouseover="this.className='On'" onmouseout="this.className='Off'"&gt; But the cat won.     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;      urlLink continued story...

      PHP auto-redirection is an overlooked concept that many people fear. You should fear nothing because with a single line of code I can show you how to redirect your page to another! It's as simple as  1 - 2 - 3 .     Note:  										 The only precaution to be aware of is the code syntax. The syntax of this small, yet powerful script is very, very code sensitive. There are many single quotes and commas in this script and if you make one typing mistake, then your script will generate errors and you will end up with very unhappy visitors.   Insert the following code into your .PHP  										document you would like the redirection  										to take place:      &lt;?php    // Echos the page that you want to redirect to thus refreshing // The page to the pages specified after the code 'URL='    echo    &quot;&lt;meta equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;2;URL=&quot;&gt;&quot;  ;       ?&gt;     Conclusion  The small script may help out in many cases such as after a form has been submitted or a search has been made. This is something a web developer uses on a daily bases. I really hope this tutorial was helpful and may all your scripting be merry!  urlLink continued story...

      PHP incorporates powerful and fast date and time functionality. In this article Ryan gives us the low down on PHP's various functions to manipulate the time and date with ease. Today's web sites try to offer a wide variety of useful data and information to the viewer. This is often what makes a web site more appealing than flashy graphics and cheesy animations. In fact, sometimes it is the attention to subtle detail that helps the web developer take that extra step into making a site appear more professional.    One simple way to add a professional detail to your web site is to post the current date and time within your web page. As insignificant as this might sound, it is a very commonly used way to show visitors that your site is slightly ahead of the curve. 										 The following basic PHP tutorial will show you how to use a few PHP functions to retrieve date and time information from your web server and display them neatly on your web site.   We Have A  										Problem:  No matter which operating system you are running your web server and PHP on, the procedure for gathering the current date and time is the same. The first problem is that the returned value is fairly cryptic.  									For example, the following PHP code:      &lt;?php    echo   time  ();   ?&gt;     Will quickly  										translate into:       Also Note: 	 Though this may not be very user friendly, it is an accurate measure of the date and time. This numeric date and time format originates from the fact that all Unix servers tell time by counting the number of seconds that have passed since 12:00 a.m. on January 1, 1970. All we need to do is learn how to display the above information in a way that makes sense to our site visitors.   Fixing The Problem:  Using PHP to convert the Unix timestamp into something more understandable is just a matter of employing the proper function. This tutorial will cover the use of a variety of basic functions available for this task.  The most commonly used function is date(). As you might expect, this function is fairly customizable. Customization is achieved through PHP's recognition of a variety of characters submitted in the format string. Below are just a few common characters, for a complete list of them, visit the PHP   						 urlLink  documentation   website.       D: day of the week     F: the month     h: hour, 12-hour format     H: hour, 24-hour format     i: minutes     l: day of the week     Y: year     										If we combine some of this knowledge into  										PHP code, the following:        &lt;        ?php    echo   date  (  "l F d Y h:i"   ,  time  ());   ?       &gt;       										Should give a result similar to:    Monday August Mon 2004 03:42    Conclusion:  Obviously this makes considerably more sense than the previous Unix timestamp. The result could be further improved through the addition of punctuation. When additional text is introduced into the format string it is important to remember to use a backslash to comment it out. Otherwise, your text will be recognized as part of the special character string.   urlLink continued story...

      Hello Everyone! Hope everything is well. I have decided to put together an article that has to do with XHTML (HTML). After seeing way to many sites using frames   incorrectly .     Introduction  In Web Design and web technologies, there is always a correct and an incorrect way of doing something. Throughout my time as a webmaster I have seen good ways and bad ways to use frames. Personally, I do not use frames at all anymore. To me they are a hassle and somewhat, in my book, depreciated. This article, though, is not for me, but for you to be informed about the wonderful world of web design and multimedia. So come along for the information! 										 										 What Is A Frame Made Of?  										There are two parts of a frame.  There  										are the  frame(s)  and there is the 										 frameset . In small words, a   										 frameset   is the primary page that holds all the "frame" pages together into one document and implements the actual frames into the document. Slightly different, a   frame   (or frames) are the actual pages that contain HTML and/or other scripting/programming that form the whole page. So think of a frameset as a placeholder and a frame as the objects. 										 										A frameset document is a document that defines  										one or more frames by using the    frameset    										and    frame   elements. 										 										 So, What's The Advantage?  The advantage to frames is you can present multiple documents into one browser window. For example, you could make a frameset(index.html) and add the following page: a frame on the left side(nav.html) and assign the page links for your navigation links for your website. Then you may have a frame at the top of your document(header.html) inserting an image to make it look like your logo top header part of your site. Then you could make a body frame(body.html) and assign it as the target for your links so that your links target display into the body.html frame. This can get confusing if you don't do this yourself. But this is the only advantage to frames. 										 										 Yeah, But What Exactly Is The  										Disadvantage?  										The disadvantage to frames is the  										following: 										 										 										      From browser to browser (IE, NN, Opera, Mozilla, and Firefox) they don't display the same way causing your users to get annoyed or confused and they click out of your site.       Frame size has a huge factor too. People have different screen resolutions(800 X 600, 1024 X 768, and 1280 X 1024) and frames don't calculate right making your users have to scroll back and forth.       Some browsers (most anyway), do not support the fact of printing. Many web browsers just print out a certain page, but not the whole page the user is seeing. It could be the links page, or the body page, or even the header page.       Search engines have a hard time getting a correct search. Like if your site was a frameset and had all the pages as stated above, and you went to Google and searched for your site: You click the link for your site and all you get is this page of links. The user is confused and clicks out having a bad, very bad opinion about your site. And you as a web designer is displeased, because you have no, or almost no visitors.       Finally, the last, but certainly not least reason why frames are a dying tool, is the fact that tables are a whole lot cleaner. You can format and display information much better in tables rather than in frames.       										 										 Conclusion  That concludes my thoughts on frames and I really hope this article was helpful. An to make something very clear, when frames are used correctly, great things can happen. Check out    urlLink Microsoft's MSDN    										website.     urlLink continued story...

      I have been looking into Flash and its design concepts. Most are great, but only if used correctly and not "too much". There is a right way of going the flash path, and of course, a wrong way.     Introduction   I am starting to see more and more sites made in Flash (now Flash 7 (MX)). So what I did was I started looking into Flash and designed a few idealistic programs/working models. What I came to find out was that Flash isn't exactly the best thing for a website. Don't get me wrong. I designed a few web apps using actionscript and such and exported a Flash file, but it isn't (in my opinion) the best way to make a site look good.   Web Browsers   Web browsers are starting to support Flash more and more, but the thing about Flash is that it is very limited in user ability. I have seen very, very good flash sites, and unfortunately, very bad ones. The Flash sites that present themselves are the ones that are very interactive with help situations and vector graphics.   The Good & The Bad Ones  The other day I saw a site made with 100% flash and it was very hard to get around, because the designer didn't make his site user-friendly, thus I did not know what to do. He didn't have a "Home" button and it was just horrible. On another note, I have seen amazing Flash sites and have been caught in awe and amazement of what you can do with Flash and web animation interactivity. It had buttons, polls, interfaces, downloads, and everything preloaded making it very slick, fast, and flawless.   Too Much?   Flash really is a great program and a huge revolution in the web design industry, but like with anything else; it can be overused. I'm not saying that after about a million sites we should stop using Flash. What I am trying to get across is that 100% complete Flash sites can be very, very bad. Not all web browsers support Flash, and, as with any other program can malfunction at anytime leaving the user feel unwanted or disgusted with your site. Too much Flash can also be upsetting in the fact that not a lot of people are used to it and don't know exactly how to take it. As stated above, to make a Flash site better, add some help documentation in HTML format to keep the user in control not the program.   Alternatives   There are many alternatives to Flash and actually alternatives to help using Flash and HTML together. One of the best things on a Flash site I have seen is a home page splash option. What this does is it allows a person viewing the home page of a website to choose between a "Flash" version of the site or the "HTML" (HTML & CSS) version of the website. The helps the older browser and the ignorant/new people in the computer age. Another way to get away from flash is to try other web languages such as C#, Visual Basic, ASP, and my favorite, PHP/MySQL.   Conclusion   As Flash may spark your interest, you should know the good and the bad of everything. Flash is good in some aspect, but don't overuse it. If it is overused people will get tired and there can be extreme consequences. Have fun with your website and happy coding!  urlLink continued story...

      Here we are...now before you "continue", just know that I put much effort into this and imagination. As I have started graphic design, I have realized that you must have a sense of imagination. While thinking of a beautiful spot in the world; with the sun shining just off to the northwest and a canyon to your left. Bliss...total bliss...    Here is the final result...   urlLink     urlLink continued story...
