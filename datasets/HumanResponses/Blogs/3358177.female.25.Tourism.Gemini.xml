 still thinking of him, still in love with him
but there is nothing i can do,
memories, only memories can be caught tight in my hand,
things r meant to b urs, r meant to b,
let it go, then to strangle it,
when i c him happy, i'll be happy
when he hurt himself, my hearts hurts too
when he is sad, i feel like hugging him
when he is force to drink, i'll drink 4 him
wel all this can only be memories 4ever n ever
wil not 4get e day tt we know each other
e way tt we know each other
its such a sweet sweet memories 4 me
normally tt day means nothing to me but now its different 
  VALENTINE'S DAY 14.02.2004 2.25AM  
 4ever mark a special day in my life from tt day onwards
e day he starts appearing in my life
weeks passes by n i realise tt i hv fallen in love w him
feeling so strong n missing him so much
thinking of him makes my tears flows
my heart broke into pcs when his oversea's love was back
back in e month tt i wanted to have e best memories
wishes tt i made couldnt came true or no longer wil come true
only when in sweet dreams then it wil b fulfill
no matter how he wil 4ever b e sweetest memories in my mind
love 4ever n never

 Not a Jealous Bone in Your Body 
You're secure, trusting, and giving with friends and lovers

You're generally happy with your life - and no one's grass is greener than yours

      When we meet the right person to love when we're at the right place, at the right time. That's chance. When you meet someone you're attracted to, that's not a choice. That's chance. Being caught up in a moment (and there's a lot of couples who get together bec. of this) is not a choice, that's also chance.          The difference is, what happens afterward? When will you take that infatuation, that crush, that mind-blowing attraction to the next level? That's when all sanity goes back, you sit down and then contemplate whether you want to make this into a concrete relationship or just a fling.          If you decide to love the person, even with his faults, that's not chance. That's choice. When you choose to be with a person no matter what, that's choice. Even if you know there are many people out there who are more attractive, smarter, and richer than your mate, and yet, you decide to love your mate just the same, that's choice.          Infatuation, crushes, attraction comes to us by chance. But true love that last is truly a choice. A choice that we make.          Regarding soulmates, there's a beautiful movie quote that I believe is so true about this--"Fate brings you together, but it's still up to you to make it happen." I do believe that soulmates do exist. That there is truly someone made for you. But it's still up to you to make the choice if you're going to do something about it or not. We may meet our soulmates by chance, but loving and staying with our soulmate is still a choice we have to make. =)

        BEAUTIFUL ICE PRINCESS/PRINCE .You need distance between you and your partner in your relationship. You are very difficult to get. You have big requirements and this one you love must try hard to get you. But after she/he melt your heart she/he will be the most happy person in the world. You need someone who shoes you that you are special  and it makes you feel good to see that you are loved. She/He shall know that you could easily get another girl/boyfriend but you wont  as long as you love him.  when she/he hurts you you will hurt him too, but in general you dont get hurt. If your partner cheated you ,you would react cold and immediately (try to) forget him

      L O V E - A Journey  Why hold someone back.. when you noe you don't luv them..Why keep them to urself.. when you noe you won't wanna have them? Why let them miss other chances.. when they can hav them?   If you really don't love someone.. let them go…hurt them NOW.. not later.. for a longer relationship builds stronger emotions..A good relationship isnt a game you play or an ego trip you take. It is abt luv and 2 people.Loving someone can give us the greatest joy we can ever know and it can hurt more than we can believe too.&nbsp; When it does  not really hurt when dat person did something disappointing to  you, but really hurts when you see that person in pain and  sadness, then you know you truly love that person. Loving someone means you shld be ready toexperience heartache and happiness at the same time. Dats the reward and dat's the risk.  Unless we are willing to experience it, we will neverreally noe what its like to luv and be loved.   Sharing luv is probably the most valuable and meaninful experience a person can ever hav.  And there's a difference between bein in luv with someone and loving someone.  &nbsp;  Its the difference between a luv dat's fickle, wild  and short-lived and one dat's tender and passionate,  nurturing and lasts a long time. The first is easy.  The second, the one dat really matters to all of us,  takes work bcos its abt keepin a relationship. Luvin someone takes efforts. We have to be able to  communicate wit each other. Nobody can read anyone  else's mind. We always presume dat our partner noes  wad we tink and feel. Maybe in time we might be able  to predict or sense each other's thoughts but its never  perfect and takes time to develop.  &nbsp;  Gettin the chance to luv and be loved by someone is blessed.  Respect him/her for who he/she is, and not wad you wan him/her to be.  Everyone is pretty and special in his/her own special way.  No one is perfect.  &nbsp;  It is true luv which closes the gap of imperfectness to form a smooth surface of acceptance for each other.  True luv sees and accepts a person for who he/she is.It is also true luv which makes a person change for the better.  &nbsp;  The power of true luv to a person is undeniable.  A relationship needs commitments too.  What is luv without commitments from each other anyway? It's like principles and values.  Everyone has them but they only mean as much as we are willing to stand for them. The same goes for our commitments to relationships, and the person we love. "Luv is like an antique vase. Its hard to find, hard to net,  but easy to break." Every day everywhere,  people fall in love.. but juz how many of these relationships  are self-sacrificing love, and not juz relationships which  are formed only for the intense! feelin of fallin in love?  &nbsp;  I noe hundreds of friends who say  the magical words "I love you"..  but more often than not, the truth is juz I am IN love with you.  &nbsp;  There is a difference between being in  love with someone and loving someone.  &nbsp;  If a person says he/she is in love with you,  he/she means dat he/she likes you for who you are now and he/she fell in love with you bcos of the present you.  &nbsp;  This kind of love is temporary and lasts only  as long as the fairytale lasts. When fairy godmother  comes in at midnight to whirl us back to reality,  we see the heartache of such a relationship..  where both were only IN luv with each other.  &nbsp;  But if a person says he/she luvs you, he/she means dat he/she luvs you unconditionally for who you are now,  who you were in the past and who you might be in the future.  &nbsp;  When he/she says he/she luvs you and  really means it,  you hav to ask urself if you love him/her too or  if you're in love with the idea of bein in love.  &nbsp;  It is very hard to see the difference  through logical thinking.  Let your heart guide you. May you be blessed on your soul-searchin journey for your soul mate. ARE YOU RELI IN LOVE? ASK URSELF! Is this true love? Do I really love him/her?  Or is it juz another infatuation?  &nbsp;  ARE YOU willin to give?Even though you may not get back the same amount you gave?  ARE YOU cheatin urself?  Thinking dat you really love him/her and  not juz takin him/her as a substitute for your  ex-boyfriend/girlfriend? Friends, let today be the day.. you truly understand love. If after readin this andanswerin all the questions, you are very sure dat you luv him/her, tell him/her dat. Let him/her noe how much you luv him/her and dat you are willin to take the risks of being hurt by him/her in the course of the development of yourrelationship with him/her. This is a luv dats sacrificial, ARE YOU ready for it?
