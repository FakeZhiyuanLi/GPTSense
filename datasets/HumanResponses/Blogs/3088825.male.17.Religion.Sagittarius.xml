      I finally saw Kill Bill tonight. The first one. It was pretty cool...except there were like 15 minute intervals where everyone talked in Japanese and there weren't any subtitles. I'm not sure if that was supposed to happen, cause I never figured out why some people did the things they did...but it gave me time to focus on Japanese people. I know this is somewhat racist, but I couldn't tell them apart. I bet we look like that to the Japanese. I think Japanese rock bands are the funniest.     Lucy Lui would be hot if she wasn't on The View with Star Jones. All up in her Layne Bryants...

      I think I have homework or something due tomorrow, but I'm not sure.      Weird sighting of the day: I saw a lunch lady outside of her designated serving zone after school today. Like...in broad daylight and I SWEAR she was wearing an apron and carrying a spatula. I personally thought that they had bunks in the back room so that they could always and forever make good food for us...but apparently they're letting them out for free time or something. Free time, then bathroom breaks...THEN they'll want to retire because they figure working near a hot stove at 89 is somehow hazardous. Sliding down a slippery slope.     Alias kicks so much ass. I'm only on season two, but I have three more episodes left. I'm saving them all for Saturday night so that I can drown my prom sorrows with Jennifer Garner. Did you know she has a dog named Martha Stuart? ...I didn't read that in YM.

      Journalism Trip Recap:        I'm sure there are some of you who think that journalism field trips are gay. Well I spit on you who think that! All I have to say is that if you get to stay in a hotel where the guy to girl ratio is like 2:18 and then you get to stay up all night pillow fighting with the same odds...well, I think that's all I have to say my hetero friends. Anyways, so I went out to Steak n Shake cause I was the milkshake bitch and when I got back to the room everyone was wet and Ma was crying...  ...Long story short me and T's room got trashed and I only slept for three hours and I could only find like 5 of the 17 Maxim nearly-naked-girls pinnups that I had on our wall.     About the Maxim pinnups...wouldn't ANYONE come to the obvious conclusion that the magazines that are next to the comfy chairs on the Hollister porch are free for the taking, even if they are super cool Maxims? Well apparently they aren't (they cost $4.50) and if you take them the beeper won't go off and you get back to your room to discover a price tag on the bag and then you have to pillow fight with a guilty conscience. Damn yous Hollister...damn yous all to hell.

      I really like that commercial they play for Fandango before a movie starts...the one where everyone's a bag puppet. Anyways, the best part is when they have the two bags that are supposed to be a married couple and they're like "we don't always go to movies on weekends cause we go clubbin." ...I just thought that was worth bringing up.

      So this is my first blogger post and it's kind of cool because I can say whatever I want without it being graded or something.    So tonight was our first track meet, which was cooler and not as embarrassing as I thought it would be. Cause like, I suck at hurdles...even though they're on girly height   I just kind of prance over them. Anyways, I finished the race without any embarrassing incidents...so that was cool. But we have to wear these insanely small shorts that ride up your ass whenever you move...so you always have a wedgie which is ok after like the first 2 hours. And it got really cold outside and you can see everyone in the crowd wearing warm things and then you look at yourself and youre wearing some type of plastic fanny shorts and you end up hating each and every person in that crowd. Yeah...so track kind of sucks sometimes.       I'm kind of upset because today went off without any good April Fools Day pranks...which sucks. I was expecting something to at least explode during lunch. I wonder if other countries have April Fools Day...like Mexico or Algeria or something. Haha...that's kind of funny to think about. Like Mexican kinds making a concrete pinata. THAT would be a good Mexican April Fools Day Joke, seeing that the pinata is practically a daily ritual. I'm movin to Mexico.

      School starts soon...something like less than a month. I'm not sure exactly when, but the point is that summer is pretty much over. i kind of wish that they would just surprise me with school because it pretty much just destroys the last few weeks of summer; knowing that school is so close. you cant really focus on everything that  is  summer...youre too worried about how much youre going to hate school. it would be better if like nobody knew when school started so that one day youre just walking down the street and a white van slams on its breaks and kidnaps you and takes you to school. that way, the end of summer isnt ruined...plus it would be kind of cool. you could even tape what goes down so you and your buds can watch the kidnapping later and find out who was the pussy and cried. he'd be like, bitch for a week

      I was at Wal-Mart tonight and to my disbelief i saw  Vanilla Sky  in the bargain bin for 5 dollars alongside such hits as  Action Jackson ,  Shaft Goes to Africa , and  Beyblade  (the plot being cartoon japanese kids with crazy hair and big eyes do battle and solve problems via pimped out dradles). I was pissed on two levels...the first that i bought that VERY same copy of  Vanilla Sky &nbsp;for like 20 bucks at that VERY same Wal-Mart. The second that it was considered a bargain bin movie. have you SEEN those movies in there?! Fucking  Shaft Goes to Africa ?!?!&nbsp; Vanilla Sky &nbsp;kicks  Shaft's  ass whether he's hanging out in Africa or not. I just couldn't wrap my head around the obvious misplacement until i saw 50 other copies in that bin of sin. luckily the sponge bob square pants silk boxers were right around the corner to lighten my mood...speaking of those boxers, nothing, in my opinion, is more classy.

      I saw the documentary  Super Size Me  tonight and that, my friends, is how a documentary should be made. Fuck Michael Moore and his "asking congressmen to enlist their sons" shananagans. That's right...fuck Michael Moore &nbsp; fuck him up his stupid ass. After seeing  Super Size Me  I think I may have to cut back on my McHelpings. They showed this picture of the guy who went on the McDonalds diet for thirty days...a before and after thing. in both pictures the dudes wearing a red white and blue speedo...but the most notable difference is that in the first picture he has a lump where im assuming his balls are...in the after picture...there IS no lump. &nbsp;&nbsp; McDonalds steals your balls. "Daddy, what makes these chicken McNuggets so darned good?" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well son, it's allll in the ingredients. *dad puts arm around boy*&nbsp; Ronald McDonald doesn't use real chicken in those tasty nuggets...he doesn't use chicken at all. The secret to those lumps of pleasure are balls. You're eating balls at this very second. *dad pops nugget into mouth* Now  I'm &nbsp;eating balls! *dad and son break into laughter* Chances are someone out there has eaten my removed balls.  &nbsp;*son ponders* "Is that why mom left you?" &nbsp;*dad chuckles* "Yeah...*mutters* what a whore." &nbsp; ...cough... &nbsp;    A SIGN THAT THE END OF THE WORLD IS LOOMING    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Dylan, after forty years of folk music success and rebellious nature decides to throw it all away to back Victoria's Secret by appearing in a commercial (he just kinda walks around in the background looking all brooding and shit) and offering a free cd with purchase of bra and pany set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hard rains a gonna fall, bob.

      A friend of mine just sent me one of those email survey things...those cute little questionaires that are so fun and interesting and neat to start out on but then when you get to the open ended questions like whats your favorite food...you stall. i was on that question for the better part of an episode of seinfeld...i couldnt even pay attention to kramers antics because i was pro and conning lasagna. like, i actually had to take half the quiz...take a half hour break and then come BACK to the thing. the last question asked how long it took you to complete the survey...i lied and said ten minutes. i cant let on that im a loser. &nbsp; on the subject of those surveys...i think it would be more productive to have serious questions, therefore actually getting to know who your REAL friends are.  &nbsp; example: &nbsp;&nbsp; " If some crazy Saudi was threatening to end the world but said that he wouldnt if you would kill either A. your mother or B. your first born child&nbsp;&nbsp; who would you shoot in the face to save all of humanity?"   &nbsp;&nbsp;  then after something like that you could soften the mood with a "whats your favoritest color" question.&nbsp;&nbsp; parry and joust &nbsp; i actually used to use the email survey to find out if chicks dug me or not. pretty smart for a 7th grader eh? i would devise this seemingly harmless survey with all the normal questions so that i would lull my victims into a brain atrophy and then spring on the "what do you think of the person that sent this to you" questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also so i didnt look weird...id forward the first copy to myself so it looked like i didnt create the survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wow...so much for not wanting to look like a loser.

      I've come to realize that our generation sucks. i wish i lived in the 70s. Dylan, Led Zeppelin, the Gong Show...this is what i need. Spaulding was right...reality tv sucks. my mom takes the tv guide every sunday morning and highlights in pink highlighter all the shows she watches for the entire week. this in itself is kind of weird...but the ONLY shows she watches are reality based. i told her that maybe she watches all of these reality tv shows because she, in fact, is upset with her own reality and finds comfort in watching other people fuck up all the time. she got really pissed at me and stormed out of the room. what does THAT mean. call me Freud bitch

      Now i hate that Fandango commercial. I've heard the word TWICE since my last Fandango post which leads me to believe that the word isnt really made up. theres even a movie at Hollywood Video called Fandango...i think its about cowboys or something. oh   and its in that Queen song... "im just a poor boy nobody loves me" that one. it just sucks that something so clever as bag puppets have to plagiarize.     new favorite movie commercial: Fanta. wow     especially Kiki

      so im going to Hawaii tomorrow. actually im flying to seattle, staying for a couple days, then heading out to Hawaii. Hawaii is the only thing in this post that deserves to be capitalized...unless i speak of God. anyways...i have this bias on Hawaii already. i think that right when i land everyone everywhere will be bikini clad. what about the guys you ask? what guys i say. hopefully ill learn to surf...and then i can find a secret tiki necklace like they did on the brady bunch. except my tiki necklace will be cooler looking. the one on the brady bunch was really clunky...very obtrusive. like double d breasts.
