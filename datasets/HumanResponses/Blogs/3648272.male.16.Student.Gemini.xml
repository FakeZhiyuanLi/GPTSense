      Well, its been a while so I think im gonna write in the blog. Today was a pretty good day. I woke up late (not 6:45 as usual). I went to the gym to do some nice morning cardio...my mom went to the aerobics class. So after I finished the cardio, I was waiting for her to get out of the damn class but apparently the class never ends. So I did another 10 mins of cardio and they still weren't done. So I jus went to the aerobics class for another 15-20 mins. I don't mind it. All women except me :)...not that theres anyone even the least-bit attractive there.   Afterwards me and my friends went to see Spiderman 2. I was rele hoping that it would be good because I missed a good soccer game to see that movie. And thankfully, it was pretty sick. Better than the first one...possibly. One thing I found strange was that the theater was completely filled. Is it just me or does anyone else find it wierd that the theater should be full at 1:20 on a Wednesday? Doesn't anyone work on Staten Island?  Anyway, I'm home now. I plan on going to the gym again later to do some weight lifting. We ran out of the good protein shake, so now I'll probably hafto drink the crappy one...yuck..fuckin chocolate. I would seriously like to meet the idiot that thought of giving protein shake a chocolate flavor.   That's basically it for today. I'm going up-state this fourth of july weekend. Time to put that boating license to good use. Imma give water skiing another try. Maybe this time I can hold my ass steady on the skiis for more then 5 seconds. lol.   BTW, Nip Tuck was on last night. It was pretty cool. I love the way Christian broke his nose....for those of you who still haven't seen Nip Tuck, get the first season dvd! You won't regret it!

      By the title of this post you could probably guess why I'm so happy. Unfortunately the happiness won't last for long. It appears as if my plans to join the track team this summer have been put on hold. In July I'm taking a math college course that I got a scholarship for. At the same time, I will probably be taking SAT Math/English prep courses. So that kinda blows. On the bright side, the college course is free, the credits can be transferred and it only lasts 3 weeks, so that's 15 days of class (each session is 3.5 hours long). The SAT courses are 2 hours long, I think, and they last the whole summer, but it's only once per week.   Anyway this year was tough, but I finished off with a 98.6 average. My parents are going to atlantic city tomorrow, so I get the house to myself. Sounds good, doesn't it? Well...not really. While my parents are away, I'll be babysitting my 7 year-old brother...so much for the beer and the bitches.   I was watching the European Championship in Soccer today. I don't normally keep up with sports on TV but I do keep up with major games in soccer. Wow impressive game. It was the Quarter-finals, I think... Holland Vs. Sweden. Incase you're wondering, Holland won by a penalty shot. It was a pretty amazing game. Which brings a question to mind. How do so many Americans find (American)football and baseball so fasinating? A soccer game is intense, people constantly running back and forth, the whole tide of the game could change with one shot. People literally pray and cry in the stands during a soccer game. In american football or baseball, the guys are standing around half the time. Especially in baseball, half the time all you see is te guy getting ready to bat. Come on! Where's the suspense? Where's the drama?, Wheres the action? .....boring! It doesn't make sense to me how soccer is the major sport in every other country in the world except America. But oh well, to each his own I guess.

      So it’s Thursday. I really need something to do. I mean all this physical activity gets boring after a while. And I do consider myself pretty physically active, a lot more than the avg kid at least. Between the 3-mile morning jogs, weight lifting, aerobics, swimming, basketball, and various other activities, I get worn out. But I’m looking for other things to do. God I need a girl, lol.   Staten Island is such a boring place it’s scary. There is very little to do, especially when you don’t have a car. Staten Island barely has any clubs (or at least good ones), and really no place where you can just go to hang out with people your age or w/e and mingle or meet new people or w/e. All it has is a couple of movie theaters. Other than that you can entertain yourself with sports or electronics. It’s really sad that technology has brought us to a point that we have more people socializing through the internet than in real life. And I’m not talking bout Instant message/email. I’m talking about games on the internet like MMORPGs and stuff like that that people spend hours at a time playing. I don’t blame these people at all. It’s the fault of society as a whole.   Anyway that’s all for now.   BTW- I hope everyone reading this has a great summer, seeing as though school is pretty much over.

      I was workin out at the gym last night. I was doing alot and I took pretty heavy dumbells and kind of dropped them. I'm ok but I have a pain in the upper part of my right arm and the lower part of my left arm. It's not that bad, I can still work out. It's just an annoying type of pain like when you over-stretch or something. Hopefully it will go away in a couple of days. Today is my day-off-from-the-gym-day so all I did was some heavy morning cardio. Tomorrow i'll probably go to the aerobics class and then hopefully by friday my arms will fully recuperate.   What happend was kind of a wake-up call. If you're gonna be lifting heavy weights, you better becareful because theres nothing worse than getting an injury at the gym.   Anyway last night was the season premiere (of season 2) of Nip Tuck. It was awesome. 1 full hour. No commercials. The next episode will be shown next tuesday at 10 PM on FX.

      Finally, I declare school UNOFFICIALLY OVER! I say unoffically because school officially ends on the 25th but all the regents are over and there's nothing left anyway. I took the spanish regents today. It was relatively easy compared to the physics and it was relatively short compared to the global.   After the regents, I jus came home, ate breakfast and went to play basketball. Didn't play for long though because it was really humid outside. Afterwards, I just took a nap, and i'll probably go to the gym around 9.   On a side note, today marks the beginning of a new season of Nip Tuck. That's right! Nipt tuck is the best show on TV. Today at 10 pm on channel FX is the 1st episode of the second season. I'm not sure when they will show re-runs of the first season but you can buy the 1st season DVD on amazon.com if you're interested. Nip Tuck is a show about two plastic surgeons in Florida, Dr. Sean McNamara and Dr. Christian Troy. While Sean is the brains behind the operation and a family man, Christian is an eccentric playboy who pretty much gets a new girl every night and always gets himself and Sean into illegal business deals/surgeries and ofcourse Sean is forced to clean his shit up....anyway i'm not gonna tell the whole story here but the show is AWESOME, I highly recommend it.   That's all for now kiddies.

      Yesterday was a pretty busy day, hence I didn't post on the blog till today. Yesterday morning I woke up at 7:00 AM, I went to the gym for 2 hours (Cardio + weights + abs). I came back at 9 AM, took a shower, and then a nap. At 1 PM, I went to my friend's brother's birthday party. It was at some stupid kids place. Laser tag was fun though, I got almost 10,000 points. Afterwards, I went to my friends house, another dude came over and we were just chillin.   Then later on we went to see Chronicles of Riddick. It was alright. Not bad, nothing special though. Unless you like Vin Diesal or Sci fi movies, I wouldn't really recommend it.   By the time I got home it was like 11:30 PM. I was pretty tired so I just went to sleep. Anyway that was my day, I might post again later today...maybe.

      So, I'm posting this at midnight right now. I would have posted sooner but I was kinda busy. I woke up at 6:30 AM today and went to the gym. Yes, at 6:30 i did wake up and go to the gym for an aerobic workout...2.5 mile jog on treadmill (w/ incline ofcourse) and 10 mins on the bicycle. It was tough as hell but worth it. I felt energetic for the rest of the day. I guess workin out in the morning kind of temporarely boosts your metabolism for a short time.   Anyway, after that I decided to relax. I went out for a little while but it was really hot, so I ended up staying in most of the day.  God, I can't wait till the pool opens (which is tomorrow btw)  I spent most of the day at home. Fuckin weather was brutal. I was watching "007 Die another Day". Not a bad movie at all, and that's comming from someone who really doesn't like James Bond. Afterwards, I loaded like 50 more songs into my ipod...took me like an hour to sort everything out.  At 9:00 PM, I went back to the gym to lift weights and do my usual ab workout. It was pretty intense, but like the morning jog, it was worth it.  Anyway...that was my day. Nothing special. One issue that I want to address though is Lies, scams, and deceptions. This has really been bothering me lately. I feel like people are continously lieing to me, telling me half-truths, or trying to deceive me. And what's worse is that I keep catching them at it and they still refuse to come clean. I'm going to conclude this post by giving everyone some friendly advice, ALWAYS WATCH OUT FOR SCAMS AND DECEPTION. You'de be surprised just how many people will lie to you in a given day, and it may come from people that you already know. No one is who they appear to be. That's it for now. Take care and tune in tomorrow for another post. Same time, same channel.

      Alright, this is my first blogger post (or watever you want to call it). I've been meaning to start one of these things for a while now, but everything was pretty busy. Danny was right when he said this thing is better than xanga. Xanga blows....except Jenny's of course (compelling stuff Jenny...compelling stuff). Anywho, lets get this blog started.  Allow myself to introduce....myself. For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of meeting me, my name is Paul. I'm 16 and currently attending the  prestigious  institute of Tottenville High School. I like to workout, listen to music, hangout….you know the usual teen thing.   Anyway, thank god school is almost over. I really hate school.  Why?  Because it’s a pain in the ass. Bad teachers + useless projects + hard tests – a normal education = waste of time. That’s the formula for school. But all I really have left is the Spanish regents. So it’s almost over. I took physics the other day. Everyone thought it was REALLY HARD. Personally, I didn’t think it was that bad. It was difficult, no question bout that but it wasn’t like the massacre more commonly known as the AP bio test.  I took Global Regents today. It was alright. Not easy, not hard. I finished the multiple choice in about 20 mins. The essays took me like 2 and a half hours. They weren’t bad. I thought the essays were a lot easier than the multiple choice, just really really really loooooooong. Next Tuesday is the Spanish regents. I’m not worried. I really didn’t study that much for global and probably not going to study for Spanish either. Oh well.   Anyway that was my day. I’m really tired now, so maybe I’ll take a nap and then when I wake up I’ll probably go to the gym. God I haven’t been at the gym for like 2 weeks all ready! Friggin school. Friggin finals…which I didn’t study for. Friggin projects which I lose every time my computer crashes. Oh well, but that’s all over. Anyway, this is the end of this post. I wish it could have been more interesting. Till next time.

      Its been a long time since I wrote in this damn thing. I try not to neglect the blog but I’ve been really busy lately. So lemme just recap on the events that took place after my last post.   I went to the Poconos like 2 weeks ago. Had a good time. I played bball, pool, ping pong. I also went water skiing. I actually stood up for longer than 10 seconds on the skiis. I really have to say that water skiing is like 20000x harder than regular skiing. I spent the 4th of July weekend up there. I went out on the boat and saw them shoot off the fire works. My friends and I shot off some fireworks too but ours weren’t that great. In fact, we almost hit a few people with our fire works. As for fishing, I normally enjoy fishing but it wasn’t so great that weekend. I woke up at 6 AM to go fishing and I only caught like 3 fish…waste of time. I also managed to get sun burn, although it didn’t hurt a lot.   After the 4th of July weekend things went downhill. CSI offered me a scholarship to take one college course over the summer for the month of July. I decided to take it because it was free college credits. I actually took the math course… Math 113 Introduction to statistics and probability with computer applications or some B.S. like that. The class lasts 4 weeks, 15 sessions, Monday-Thursday, 3.5 hours per session (the first week we only had 3 sessions…Tuesday-Thursday). Although the material covered in class, isn’t insanely difficult, the class isn’t that easy. Since we only have 15 sessions, we have to squeeze in an ENTIRE course in those 15 sessions. So out of those 15 times, I have 4 tests and a final + a shit load of homework….like 60 problems a night minimum. It’s pure hell. At least I’m halfway done (I only have 8 sessions left). In addition to this crappy math class, I also started an SAT (verbal) class. This class isn’t as bad. It’s only once a week for 1.5 hours. Unfortunately the teacher makes sure I come home with 5 hours of homework + 1 test a week. It’s not as bad as it sounds; it’s just a pain in the ass because I’m taking it in conjunction with the math.   Aside from school, my gym/diet routine is getting more different every week. My gym routine is pretty much the same with a few minor changes. Now I’m starting weightlifting for the legs (calves, hamstrings, quads..etc). Also my morning cardio won’t always be on the treadmill + bike. Now I actually go outside and do a real jog for 30 mins. As for my diet, I’ve been reading may routines and articles, so I’ve upped my caloric intake to 1500 a day (previously it was 1200). 1200 is pretty much starvation, especially when I am very active and I’m afraid it will eat away my muscle tissue, not to mention slow down my metabolism. I’m probably going to stick to 1500 calories for 6 meals a day (each meal being 250 calories) for 4 days a week, the remaining 3, I will crank it down to 1000 calories a day and then switch up to 1500 the following 4 days. I’ll be doing this type of caloric cycling for a while to see if it works. I might even post up my progress log for the coming weeks. I’m going to stick to this routine for about 3-4 weeks. If I don’t see progress, I’ll flush it down the toilet and start with a new routine.

      Many people have recently been asking me: Why do I keep such a strict diet? Why do I workout so much? So I thought I’d answer them. But before I give you the answer let me give you my history with dieting/working out.   It all started the summer after 8th grade, I was shorter than 5’ 6”, I think, and I weighed around 175...thats a lot. So I thought it would be healthy to lose some weight, not to mention I’de look like a normal person lol. So I signed up to the gym. I would go once a day, about 3-4 times a week. In each session, I would run on the treadmill for 10 mins, walk for 10 mins, and go on the bike for 10 mins. In addition, I kept a diet that wasn’t strict, just limited myself on certain carbs/sugars. That summer I went down to like 160 IBS.   When school started, I stopped going to the gym but I held my diet fairly well. So I didn’t gain and I didn’t lose anything. The summer after 9th grade, I went back to the gym, with the same gym routine only this time I was stricter with what I ate, eliminating all excess fats, sugars, and carbs. That summer I went down to like 145 IBS.   When school started again, I stopped going to the gym, but still kept the strict diet. In March I went back to the gym. But this time, the routine was a bit different. I would run on the treadmill for 20 mins straight, non stop. Then bike for 10 mins, then weights, then abs. I made my diet even stricter. When June came I weighed around 137 IBS. Summer was on the way and I knew I would have to kick it into gear to lose that little bit of extra weight.   As soon as the SAT II was over, I started a whole new regimen. I would go to the gym everyday, twice a day. Mornings I would do cardiovascular exercise. 30 minutes on the treadmill, with incline. I would run over 3 miles. Then I would do the bike for 10 mins on a high level. At night I would come back, run another mile in 10 mins just for warm-up. Then I would lift weights for about an hour and 15 mins. Then I would finish it off with a mini ab routine. I would do this everyday, except Wednesday where I would only do morning cardio and Thursday when I would go to an aerobics class instead of weights. I follow this regimen to this very day.   Pertaining to food, aside from fruits and veggies, I barely eat any carbs, and when I say BARELY, I mean it. I drink only skim milk. I sometimes eat corn flakes but usually my cereal is a special brand that only has 3 carbs and 17 grams of protein. I eat about one piece of toasted whole wheat bread every 2 days. In a given day I consume around 1000-1200 calories, I burn more than half of that at the gym just doing morning cardio. Now it’s the end of June and I weigh around 130 IBS.  So the question people keep asking me. Why do I do all this? Well first off, let me tell you, I don’t think I’m fat. In my eyes, I’m normal. So you’re probably asking,  if you don’t think you’re fat, why follow such a strict regimen, when you can do half as much and still maintain the same weight?  Well there are a few reasons, but lets start with the obvious one. The number 1 reason is….. Girls. For any ladies reading, let me let you in on a little secret. Guys don’t do things that make them uncomfortable for their own sake. Guys like to keep things as comfortable as possible. They don’t like to waste their time on looking good or wearing nice clothes. Anytime a guy exercises rigorously at the gym, dresses very nice, wears nice cologne, or does anything out of the ordinary he’s doing it to impress some girl or a specific girl, and any guy that disagrees with this or says otherwise is a liar. And that is the COLD HARD TRUTH. So now you understand, I don’t just want to see my abs, I want others to see them. This brings me to my second reason. Doing all of this brings forth a sense of accomplishment, if that makes any sense. After I work my ass off, I feel as though I’ve accomplished something. And why shouldn’t I? I can’t name one single living person  whom I know  that does as much or nearly as much as I do.   Another reason I do all of this is to stay healthy believe it or not. My father once told me a story (true story, it was published in a book).  In this story, there was a guy who used to pretty much live a carefree life in terms of nutrition and exercise. He then came in contact with a serious illness. Not sure what the illness was, but this was a long time ago, so medicine and technology wasn’t as advanced as today. The prognosis was bad. The guy was going to die. But by some twist of fate, some miracle, he came out alive. After he was diagnosed, he swore to god that if he would survive he would change his lifestyle around.  And he kept his promise. From that day he would always eat healthy/exercise and all of that mumbo jumbo (he was seventeen at the time). So you’re probably wondering what happened to the guy. He kept a strict regimen his whole life and he died at the age of 84. You’re probably thinking that is not to amazing since you know many people who survive that long now. But I bet you can’t guess how this guy died. He died while surfing. SURFING AT THE AGE of 84! How many 84 year-olds do you know go surfing? Probably none. When they did an autopsy and cut the poor bastard open, the doctors couldn’t believe it. This guy’s blood/organs or w/e were so clean and in such good condition that he actually had the body of a 20 year-old! In our society today, no one is like that. We have contaminated ourselves with fast food, and pretty much everything else. Now, even with top-of-the-line medicine/technology, the average American does not live past 80. And even then we usually sit in wheel chairs or have various health problems. This guy was completely healthy.   This guy is almost like a role-model to me. I would much rather be healthy and active in 60 or 70 years than suffer from various health problems. I know a lot of people probably feel hatred towards those who were blessed with super metabolisms and don’t gain anything from what they eat, despite what they eat. You might see some of these people consume the unhealthiest foods and still remain in good shape. I bet you probably hate then. Well don’t bother. What these people fail to realize is that their super metabolisms don’t last forever. With every passing decade, your metabolic rate decreases by 10%. That’s 1% a year for those who are mathematically challenged.  Which means, that there super metabolisms won’t last forever, but there unhealthy habits will last a very long time because it’s already programmed into their minds in a subconscious level. Why do you think so many fat 40 year-old Americans try all diets and fail? It’s because they have been eating poorly there whole lives and these habits have been engraved into their mind at the subconscious level, so despite their most sincere efforts they will always set themselves up to fail in the long run. I would also like to mention that those with super metabolisms may not be gaining weight in there early years, but they are damaging all of their bodily organs and blood, not to mention overall health. I’m sure some of these people suffer from cholesterol problems and other medical issues. The fact is that nature did not design the human body to consume more than half the foods you see in an ordinary super market. All though these people may be eating whatever they want and not gaining anything, they are damaging their body and after they hit 30 they will feel the effects of their bad decisions. By eating any snack that you see in a store, like fruit rollup for example, what are you actually doing? In essence you are putting chemicals into your body, chemicals that were not meant to ever be digested, by our bodies. These chemicals do damage over time, and we only feel the affects after a certain number of years.   So to sum it all up. Why do I do what I do?  1. Girls 2. Gives me a sense of accomplishment 3. To stay healthy  WOW that was really long. Feel free to leave any comments, but don’t bother bashing this post. Nothing ANYONE can say will change my regimen. With every passing day, what I do becomes easier and more natural. Sometimes when I look at pizza I don’t even want to eat it anymore knowing that it’s just no good. So that’s it for this long passage.
