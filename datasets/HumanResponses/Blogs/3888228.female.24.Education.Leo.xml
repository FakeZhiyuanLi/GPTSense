      Woohoo! I'm 24 years old today! And I'm in Hong Kong in an interenet cafe where it is absolutely freezing (air conditioning is on super super high) but it is still better than being outside in the sweltering heat! It's 29 degrees here with 85% humidity. How am i going to live here??!  Anyway our move from Fukuoka to Hong Kong went really smoothly thanks to the help of alot of our friends (THANK YOU Sachiko, Tomomi and Annie!). We are now trying not to spend too much money furnishing our house and trying to just relax before we go home. It is SO exciting though! We just want to go home. I can't wait for my mum and dad's food, and roast dinner, marmite, Eastenders and to see all my friends of course.  Anyway I'd best go before I turn into a Snowwoman. Brrr.  &nbsp;

      We had our farewell BBQ party at Church today. It was really sad because there are so many lovely people we are going to miss. They bought us flowers and said some really nice things about our time at FIC.&nbsp; Thank you&nbsp;to everyone; Masato, Ayako, baby Anri, Aiko, Atsuko, Tomomi, StePHen, Shigeko, Yoshi,&nbsp; Annie and everyone else. (Masato bari sugoi desu! And Stephen IS good!)  To see photos of FIC youth group click  urlLink this!

       urlLink    Yesterday I said goodbye to my student and friend, Aki (2nd from the left) and we went on a cruise with her two friends Mika and Yuko. It was great, we took a picnic with us and when we got to our destination of uchino...... (can't remember!) we ate, drank and watched fireworks. It was "bari kakui ne". &nbsp; urlLink

      Hey everyone, I applied for a job in HK about a month ago and had to wait till today for the answer and I GOT IT!!!!!!!! It's working in a primary school with kids aged 6-11. The pay is good and the best thing is I get loads of holidays! I get all school holidays off, so I can hopefully travel and come home a bit more often. However as a result of having to attend training for this job I have to go to Hong Kong very early, cutting short my stay by about 2 weeks :(  So I'm going to be home from 3rd August - about 13/14/15 August. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be able to see everyone,&nbsp; sorry guys. I'll try to contact you all though. &nbsp; More bad news; it seems we won't be taking our cute ickle kitten to HK after all. It turns out the company wants us to pay more than Â£800 for her! So we really have to find her a home here and we only have 7 days before we leave ARGH! Ok love yas xxx &nbsp; &nbsp;

       urlLink     ARGH! We are soooooooo busy and stressed trying to sort out everything for the move. Sniff has to go the vets and then she's staying with one of my friends until she gets sent to Hong Kong. (Thank you sooooo much Hiromi!).  &nbsp;  We went to Ohori Park on Sunday with the Church youth group. We had a luvvly time, it was so sunny and everyone brought great food - Thank you Aiko's mum for the yummy onigiri! Even though it was sooooo hot we stayed out all day and even saw some fire throwers. I'm really going to miss Fukuoka and my friends :(&nbsp; (To see pics&nbsp;of the group click  urlLink this )  &nbsp;  But I am really looking forward to coming home even if it's only briefly. Will try to see you all but not sure how coz I'll only be back for one weekend :( You guys'll just have to save up for Hong Kong!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    On Sunday I went to Church and my friend Sachiko (her name means&nbsp;happy child; and she really is always smiling!) was baptised. Pastor Seat baptised her, and it will probably be his last baptism in Japan because he and June are going back to America next month :(  We went to the Church retreat in Mori No Ie and she was baptised in the river. It was such a beautiful place and everyone enjoyed the service.   &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is our kitten, Sniff. Dan found her on the street and she was really sick. We think a family must have thrown her out. She's only 8 weeks old and she's sooooooooooooo cute. We really love her and are going to try to take her with us to Hong Kong even though it's going to be very difficult. Meow! &nbsp; urlLink
