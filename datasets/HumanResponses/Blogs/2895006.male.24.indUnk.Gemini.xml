						   By Ilya Shapiro Ilya Shapiro is completing a clerkship with the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.  July 5, 2004  Finding a place to watch international soccer in Jackson, Miss., may not be the hardest thing to do in the world, but it's right up there. As I resign myself to listening to European Cup matches on the BBC's streaming audio and reading about the Copa Libertadores playoffs the next morning at work, I can't help but think of all I'm missing by living in Red America, the part of the country that votes Republican.    Though I've had a wonderful time living in the Deep South, I find myself envious of friends in the big coastal cities, with their theater outings, sidewalk cafes and orders of Thai food at 3 a.m. There just isn't much immigrant or bohemian flavor around Jackson, and most of the interesting, ambitious locals tend quickly to become emigrants.  Yet when it comes to politics, my preferences couldn't be farther from those of folks in Los Angeles or San Francisco, Manhattan, Boston and the rest of Blue America — the Democratic part — or closer to those with whom I share little apart from my morning commute.  And I am not the only one in this great polarized country of ours who senses a certain disconnect between cultural and political affinities. Periodic travels around the United States have introduced me to many others with my peculiar affliction, and we are distrusted by coastal elites and populist sages alike.   You see, I reside in that quixotic region, Purple America, where the cosmopolitan meets the conservative. Purple America is not so much a place as an idea, or a confluence of values from Red America with tastes from Blue America. It combines a strong belief in personal responsibility, ordered liberty and civil society with a passion for independent film, Belgian ale and salsa dancing. It also could go with a good ballgame, preferably on grass and without the designated hitter.   Purple Americans are, more or less, Crash Davis with a healthy serving of je ne sais quoi.   The terms Red and Blue America are misnomers, of course; only the "mainstream" TV networks could paint the least revolutionary states red while leaving the "progressives" royal blue. Perhaps the confusion is appropriate, however, as only in America are people who favor more government control over the economy called "liberal" and those who want to deregulate and privatize "conservative."   In any event, although the electorate may remain evenly split in this 50-50 nation, we are finally starting to transcend the color lines. Purple Americans defy political and cultural stereotypes, and thus confound the conventional wisdom of the media, pollsters and pundits. More interestingly, in this age when college students tend to be more conservative than their parents, we are infiltrating the metropolitan bastions of liberalism as iconoclastic Smurfs: We appear to be blue while inline-skating to the Whole Foods Market, but the blood coursing through our veins is decidedly red.  Purple America demands independent creativity grounded in a solid moral core, as well as an inevitably thick skin; its inhabitants are attacked for godless "hedonism" on one side and politically incorrect "insensitivity" on the other. If I had a nickel for every time an urbane acquaintance marveled at how someone so "nice" could sympathize with those ghastly Republicans, I'd be able to build that bridge to the 21st century. Conversely, a cobblestone for every time a good ol' boy sneered at my choice of drink (wine or imported beer), car (Japanese sedan or German sports car) or clothing (mostly Italian, except my seersuckers) would lead me to that shining city on a hill. Purple America gets a tear in its eye during the Fourth of July parades of patriotism, but it relishes even more the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" on the Champs-Elysees after Lance Armstrong wins another Tour de France.  It welcomes diversity, but not the false diversity that considers a black lawyer's kid from Brentwood more worthy than the son of a West Virginia coal miner or of a Vietnamese fisherman.  Returning to my search for a locale to watch some futbol, I realize that I will never really fit in Red America. Yet I could never live in the epicenters of Blue America either, stuck in an ideological closet while limousine liberals disparage "flyover country."   So where does that leave Purple Americans? Those in Red states can reside in the imagined communities of the blogosphere, keeping busy and interested via constant work and travel. Those in Blue states can take a virtual leap into Galt's Gulch, divorcing themselves from all cocktail party discussions (as in Ayn Rand's world, this is easier to do if you care about nothing beyond your own immediate interests). I'll be trying a third route by moving to Washington, D.C., which arguably contains the highest proportion of Purple Americans.  After all, a place where the only gauche political stand is not to have one, the city with Northern charm and Southern efficiency — to hat-tip that original supply-sider with style, John F. Kennedy — seems like just the place for us conflicted souls. You'll find me at that great soccer bar called Summer's.

      I have been trying to get the  urlLink details of the new contracts  that the Union bargained for with the grocery chain. Finally did. And want to know what the Unions got their workers? They got them a delay of 2 years, before having to pay for their medical insurance in the third year. Woopsi Daisy! It is actually less than two years if you factor in the 4 month that the workers were walking those lines.  I think this has been a bad year for the Unions. First off, their C]candidate for the Democratic Nomination (Gepherdt) lost miserbly even after having the support of almost all Unions. Then you have this badly planned and fought strike. What does all that mean? Believe it or not Unions seem to be dying. Now is that good or bad? Honestly, I do not know. All I know is that Unions as they stand now are corrupt and used by few to further their own gain. Just FYI, it has been reported that the this Union's director makes amost $260 a year. Labor of the World Unite! :)   urlLink

      The New York Times (NYT) has a disgusting article about how big Hollywood plans to deal with Gibson in the future.  Here is a money quote from the article:   "One question is, `What propelled him to make the movie about the passion of Christ?' " Mr. Medavoy said. "It makes me a little squeamish. What makes me squeamish about religion in general is that people think they have the answer: `I think my God is the right God.' How do you argue against that?"   This is what is killing them, it is the exculsivity of the Christian message. But have someone make a movie about the notion that Christ was a homosexual (The Last Temptation of Christ), and horay! We have finally escaped the narrow confinement of religion. But don't those Hollywood shmucks get it? If you say that Christ is a homosexual for instance, you are presenting an EXCULSIVE view of who you think Christ was. I am sick and tired of this mindless and unthoughtful arguements about religion and specifically Christianity. Think for a moment what kind of reaction would a movie about Islam induce.  urlLink Read the story!

      I watched IT! I have many thoughts running in head, but I am going to blog them in increments. I thought I should start with some of the funny things that happened in the journey to watch the movie and move on to the serious stuff... First off, I go to the theater and there are 2 news trucks waiting out there. Did they interview me? No! I am going to sue for emotional distress. Then the guy that was taking our ticket stubs was appropiately named "Christian". Right before the movie started, Mr. Christian came into the theater and announced that this is a subtitled movie (really?!?!?) and that the theater has furnished the patrons with boxes of Kleenex since this is an emotional movie! Oh I forgot, for the first time in my life I stood in line for a movie. Okay, that is it for now. P.S. Nobody in the theater I was watching it at died of a heart attack.

      The High Court ruled on  Davey v. Locke , the case from Washington State that dealt with whether a state violates the Establisment Clause (the supposed wall between Church and State) when it gives a scholarship that is avaliable to all students to a student who chose theology as a course of study.  The ruling was 7-2 and it ruled that the State is right if it denies such scholarship. That is simply an absurd ruling. The best case for how absurd this ruling comes in an analogy postulated by professor Volokh in his  urlLink blog , here is a taste of it:   If the state of Washington decided to give special benefits for students of devotional theology (a $3000 scholarship only to people who are studying materials that are "devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith"), that would be a sure violation of the Establishment Clause, because it would be discrimination in favor of religion. But when the state does the exact opposite, by specially excluding such students from a generally applicable program -- when it discriminates against religion -- that's completely constitutional, even though the Establishment Clause itself has long been described as barring disapproval as well as endorsement of religion, inhibition as well as promotion of religion, hostility towards as well as favoritism towards religion.   On an interesting note, since the student that is concerned with the case filed it awhile ago, he has moved on and is a student at Harvard Law School, and as my friend Roberto told me today (Hat Tip to Bobby for the info) guess what kind of law this guy is going to practice now?

Over the last two weeks, it has become clear to me that I need to spend some time back home and in company of other christians.

      It is true folks, some liberals are opposed to give gays marriage rights. Oh the horror! I just wonder why I did not read or hear about this in the conventinal media.   Here are some examples. For the full artice from Mr. John Fund, click  urlLink here :  Ms. Barbara Boxer (perhaps the most liberal senator, even more liberal than Ted Kennedy):   California's Barbara Boxer, one of the Senate's most liberal members, startled her base last week when she announced she opposed changing state law to recognize same-sex marriage. A spokesman for the senator said she believes the state's domestic partnership law provides gay couples with "full rights and responsibilities."   And then there is Jesse Jackson, can we ever have a controverasy without Mr. Jackson butting in:   Jesse Jackson told a Harvard Law School audience last week that he supports "equal protection under the law" for gays, but he did not endorse full marriage rights and questioned the analogy between gay rights and civil rights: "Gays were never called three-fifths human in the Constitution and did not require the Voting Rights Act to have the right to vote."

      As usual Roger Ebert shines again as a movie critic, I am posting his full review instead of having you go to his site. Remember this is not my review, but its Roger Ebert's from the Chicago Sun Times. Thank you Mr. Ebert for being honest...   If ever there was a film with the correct title, that film is Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ." Although the word passion has become mixed up with romance, its Latin origins refer to suffering and pain; later Christian theology broadened that to include Christ's love for mankind, which made him willing to suffer and die for us.  The movie is 126 minutes long, and I would guess that at least 100 of those minutes, maybe more, are concerned specifically and graphically with the details of the torture and death of Jesus. This is the most violent film I have ever seen.  I prefer to evaluate a film on the basis of what it intends to do, not on what I think it should have done. It is clear that Mel Gibson wanted to make graphic and inescapable the price that Jesus paid (as Christians believe) when he died for our sins. Anyone raised as a Catholic will be familiar with the stops along the way; the screenplay is inspired not so much by the Gospels as by the 14 Stations of the Cross. As an altar boy, serving during the Stations on Friday nights in Lent, I was encouraged to meditate on Christ's suffering, and I remember the chants as the priest led the way from one station to another:   At the Cross, her station keeping ...  Stood the mournful Mother weeping ...  Close to Jesus to the last.   For we altar boys, this was not necessarily a deep spiritual experience. Christ suffered, Christ died, Christ rose again, we were redeemed, and let's hope we can get home in time to watch the Illinois basketball game on TV. What Gibson has provided for me, for the first time in my life, is a visceral idea of what the Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message -- that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus -- is, I suppose, not the point. This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. Take it or leave it.  David Ansen, a critic I respect, finds in Newsweek that Gibson has gone too far. "The relentless gore is self-defeating," he writes. "Instead of being moved by Christ's suffering or awed by his sacrifice, I felt abused by a filmmaker intent on punishing an audience, for who knows what sins."  This is a completely valid response to the film, and I quote Ansen because I suspect he speaks for many audience members, who will enter the theater in a devout or spiritual mood and emerge deeply disturbed. You must be prepared for whippings, flayings, beatings, the crunch of bones, the agony of screams, the cruelty of the sadistic centurions, the rivulets of blood that crisscross every inch of Jesus' body. Some will leave before the end.  This is not a Passion like any other ever filmed. Perhaps that is the best reason for it. I grew up on those pious Hollywood biblical epics of the 1950s, which looked like holy cards brought to life. I remember my grin when Time magazine noted that Jeffrey Hunter, starring as Christ in "King of Kings" (1961), had shaved his armpits. (Not Hunter's fault; the film's Crucifixion scene had to be re-shot because preview audiences objected to Jesus' hairy chest.)  If it does nothing else, Gibson's film will break the tradition of turning Jesus and his disciples into neat, clean, well-barbered middle-class businessmen. They were poor men in a poor land. I debated Martin Scorsese's "The Last Temptation of Christ" with commentator Michael Medved before an audience from a Christian college, and was told by an audience member that the characters were filthy and needed haircuts.   The Middle East in biblical times was a Jewish community occupied against its will by the Roman Empire, and the message of Jesus was equally threatening to both sides: to the Romans, because he was a revolutionary, and to the establishment of Jewish priests, because he preached a new covenant and threatened the status quo.  In the movie's scenes showing Jesus being condemned to death, the two main players are Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, and Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest. Both men want to keep the lid on, and while neither is especially eager to see Jesus crucified, they live in a harsh time when such a man is dangerous.  Pilate is seen going through his well-known doubts before finally washing his hands of the matter and turning Jesus over to the priests, but Caiaphas, who also had doubts, is not seen as sympathetically. The critic Steven D. Greydanus, in a useful analysis of the film, writes: "The film omits the canonical line from John's gospel in which Caiaphas argues that it is better for one man to die for the people [so] that the nation be saved.   "Had Gibson retained this line, perhaps giving Caiaphas a measure of the inner conflict he gave to Pilate, it could have underscored the similarities between Caiaphas and Pilate and helped defuse the issue of anti-Semitism."  This scene and others might justifiably be cited by anyone concerned that the movie contains anti-Semitism. My own feeling is that Gibson's film is not anti-Semitic, but reflects a range of behavior on the part of its Jewish characters, on balance favorably. The Jews who seem to desire Jesus' death are in the priesthood, and have political as well as theological reasons for acting; like today's Catholic bishops who were slow to condemn abusive priests, Protestant TV preachers who confuse religion with politics, or Muslim clerics who are silent on terrorism, they have an investment in their positions and authority. The other Jews seen in the film are viewed positively; Simon helps Jesus to carry the cross, Veronica brings a cloth to wipe his face, Jews in the crowd cry out against his torture.  A reasonable person, I believe, will reflect that in this story set in a Jewish land, there are many characters with many motives, some good, some not, each one representing himself, none representing his religion. The story involves a Jew who tried no less than to replace the established religion and set himself up as the Messiah. He was understandably greeted with a jaundiced eye by the Jewish establishment while at the same time finding his support, his disciples and the founders of his church entirely among his fellow Jews. The libel that the Jews "killed Christ" involves a willful misreading of testament and teaching: Jesus was made man and came to Earth in order to suffer and die in reparation for our sins. No race, no man, no priest, no governor, no executioner killed Jesus; he died by God's will to fulfill his purpose, and with our sins we all killed him. That some Christian churches have historically been guilty of the sin of anti-Semitism is undeniable, but in committing it they violated their own beliefs.  This discussion will seem beside the point for readers who want to know about the movie, not the theology. But "The Passion of the Christ," more than any other film I can recall, depends upon theological considerations. Gibson has not made a movie that anyone would call "commercial," and if it grosses millions, that will not be because anyone was entertained. It is a personal message movie of the most radical kind, attempting to re-create events of personal urgency to Gibson. The filmmaker has put his artistry and fortune at the service of his conviction and belief, and that doesn't happen often.  Is the film "good" or "great?" I imagine each person's reaction (visceral, theological, artistic) will differ. I was moved by the depth of feeling, by the skill of the actors and technicians, by their desire to see this project through no matter what. To discuss individual performances, such as James Caviezel's heroic depiction of the ordeal, is almost beside the point. This isn't a movie about performances, although it has powerful ones, or about technique, although it is awesome, or about cinematography (although Caleb Deschanel paints with an artist's eye), or music (although John Debney supports the content without distracting from it).  It is a film about an idea. An idea that it is necessary to fully comprehend the Passion if Christianity is to make any sense. Gibson has communicated his idea with a singleminded urgency. Many will disagree. Some will agree, but be horrified by the graphic treatment. I myself am no longer religious in the sense that a long-ago altar boy thought he should be, but I can respond to the power of belief whether I agree or not, and when I find it in a film, I must respect it.    Note: I said the film is the most violent I have ever seen. It will probably be the most violent you have ever seen. This is not a criticism but an observation; the film is unsuitable for younger viewers, but works powerfully for those who can endure it. The MPAA's R rating is definitive proof that the organization either will never give the NC-17 rating for violence alone, or was intimidated by the subject matter. If it had been anyone other than Jesus up on that cross, I have a feeling that NC-17 would have been automatic.

      As you may expect, the LA Whines has come out against the Passion movie. Here is an interesting quote:   What is left is a film so narrowly focused as to be inaccessible for all but the devout.   Now, let us unpack this thought. The writer is angry that someone has presented a literal view of the Gospel? He is angry because the claims of an exculsive religion have in actuality exculded him from accessing the truth of the Gospels? I am very interested in how the culture that we live in has impacted our author without him realizing. In our culture exculsive claims like that slavation is through Christ only are not only deemed to be idiotic but they are sought to be destroyed. Furthermore, our culture, which preaches tolerance and accpetance, has a hard time to accepting the point of view of a person that believes that his claim is exculsive. I mean this author would not mind that Christ was portrayed as a homosexual and a womanizer in the "Last Temeptation of Christ", in fact I bet he celebrated the movie as genius. But hold on a second, isn't presenting Christ as so is in essence excluding BILLIONS of people who believe that Christ was not so? Ahh, but we are exculding people we do not care about.  urlLink Anyways, here is the link to read the full review . Its pathetic and seriously biased. The author makes a big issue of violence in the movie, but I am sure the violence in "Saving Private Ryan" or "Pulp Fiction" was artistic compared to the savagery of the Passion.

      Over at Jermey's weblog, there is an interesting post on the kind of law professors we need. I actaully concur with everything stated here, it is depressing the mediocre level of professors in law schools. Here is the post:    What I Want In A Law Professor     You are brilliant, even though you may or may not care if we realize it. I'm impressed if you wrote the casebook, but even if you didn't, you've read the casebook. You may have taught this course three dozen times already, but you still care about the subject, and it still feels fresh to you. You haven't memorized your lectures. Calling on people isn't a way to give yourself a break from talking, or thinking. You actually listen to what the students say and try to answer our questions. Even better, you use the very best questions to springboard into different areas you may not have even planned on talking about, but somehow they've become relevant. You never say, "this discussion has gotten really fascinating, but I'm going to stop it right in the middle and move on to something extremely boring." In fact, you never even think that. You have no patience for students who make the classroom anything other than a collegial atmosphere, and you don't hesitate to do what you can to eliminate any distractions they're causing. You acknowledge when material is confusing. You admit when you've made a mistake, or misspoken. You double-check any math you do on the blackboard, but don't fight it when twelve students tell you you've added wrong. You don't tell us we can learn the subject better from a commercial study guide, even if you think it might be true. You tell us just enough about who you are and what you've done that we're in awe and want to know more, but not so much that we feel like we're watching an episode of A&E Biography. You have very little patience for students who aren't trying. You have more patience for students who actually are. Even if you don't remember our names, you remember what we've said, the questions we've asked, and make us feel like you know more about us than perhaps you really do, because, to you, getting through to each student really is important. You read the newspaper and bring up relevant issues in the news. Sometimes you bring up irrelevant issues in the news, just because you think they're interesting, and, because you're brilliant, you have something interesting to say about them. You attempt to be funny, whether or not you succeed. It's the effort that counts. You don't assign reading that you don't care if we read. You don't assign reading that you're sure you won't get to. You ask hard questions, but you throw us enough rope that we can find our way back if we get lost on the way to an answer. You smile. Your exam is hard, but fair. You take the grading process seriously. You aren't afraid to e-mail us about things you think we might be interested in. You want students to come to you, but you realize that sometimes we're intimidated, and so you try to make it easier, and genuinely encourage interaction. You answer e-mails. You don't complain in class about having to have office hours. You love your job. You have a good heart. You care.   urlLink

      Below you will see two posts. One about the upcoming statewide election on March 2nd. The second is a weekly discussion question that will be posted under the title  " Can I Get A Witness?"   I would very much love your input about the two posts. I apologize for not posting the   Flick of the Wick   this week, I need to manage my time  better. This Saturday was spent reaching out to people in Dog Town (East LA) with the Dream Center. It was an amazing time, and I am praying about making it a weekly habit. Enjoy your Sunday, I am planning some reading and spending time with God!  urlLink

      Read this quote from Andrew Sullivan:  Here's a  short documentary of the line of couples in San Francisco waiting to get married. I found it revealing and deeply moving. The pictures of all those regular and not-so-regular couples waiting patiently in line for hours and hours and even days to get a piece of paper which probably won't give them any rights at all - that's revolutionary in the public consciousness. Suddenly, it's not the gay pride parades and mardi gras festivals that illustrate gay lives. Suddenly, it's love and patience and kids and umbrellas and bouquets and tuxedoes and all the other bric-a-brac of living. How hard is it to tolerate that?     What do you think about Sullivan's arguement that gay marriage is about love and committment? Is it a valid arguement? Email me your thoughts and lets have a discussion through out the week.

      Election season is in the air! And I know that you have been bombarded with ads left and right about the who to vote for, and so here comes another ad. It's not really an ad, but a personal take on the election. I have made a quick chart on my recommendations and below, I will explain my choices. Whatever you think of my choices,  I implore you to go out and vote . If you live outside OC and want help with your districts, email me your address and I will research it as much as I could and email you back an answer.    Statewide:  Democractic Presidential Candidate:   John Edwards Republican for Senate:	             Bill Jones	 Proposition 55:	                          No Proposition 56:	                          No Proposition 57:	                          No Proposition 58:                              No    Orange County:  State Senator 35th District:	                     Ken Maddox State Assembly District 68:                                 Van Tran County of Orange Supervisor District # 1:	        Kermit Marsh    Explanation of Choices:   Bill Jones:  Jones was the state's Secretary of State during the Wilson and Davis era. He is an interesting Republican, he is conservative on family issues and fiscal issues, but at the same time seems to have the ability to appeal to the largely Democratic electorate of California. Plus Jones is fiercely independent, he supported McCain against Bush, but then helped Bush campaign here. Bush and Arnie endorse him and so do I because he knows his stuff and has name recognition in the state to beat Ms. Boxer.   Prop 55:  This prop proposes a 12 billion dollars borrowing bond supposedly for schools. Please do not be deceived, the money will not go to the schools but to large bureaucracies that really hinder our schools. School funding is better initiated in Sacramento, where the legislature can debate the options and make sure that the money is going to the right areas. This prop is for 12 billion and then the expected interest is another 13 billion, leaving the state with a yearly payment of 823 million a year for the next 40 years. Folks, we are in deep trouble money wise here and that means we can not afford spending like a drunken sailor, not even if it's for education. Lets get our financial house in order and then vote for stuff like this. Remember Orange County went bankrupt in 2004 and so could the state if we do not shape up and cut spending.   Prop 56:   This is a dangerous prop.  You might see the ads in TV saying this is a prop about insuring that a budget is passed every year on time, but that is misleading. What they do not tell you is this: It lowers the vote required to pass a budget to 55% instead of 66%. What is the big deal with that? The big deal is that if one party in California has over 55% of the seats of the legislature, they can pass whatever budget they want. This budget could include major tax hikes or even social programs cuts. This is a problem because it gives tremendous power to one party, thus robbing us from the power check that could come from debates among different parties. Right now the Democrats have more than 55% of the seats of the legislature, but less than 66% (no party in the history of California reached the 66% mark).  Having 66% percent requirement to pass a budget requires cooperation between both parties and compromise on their legislative agenda.  Comprise means that no one party can decide how the budget of the state should be structured.   I urge you to vote no on this one.     Prop 57 and Prop 58:  These two props have been proposed together by Arnie. They must both pass for any of them to take effect. Prop 57 is basically a borrowing scheme designed by Arnie to somehow bail us from the financial mess that we are in now. Arnie wants to borrow $15 billion. To his credit, with this borrowing measure, Arnie proposed prop 58, which requires that every budget should be balanced. Having a balanced budget means that we, theoretically, can not put ourselves in the mess of spending more than what we have coming in. Now here is why I am voting NO on both props: I am not naive to the problems in California, but I am sick and tired of using the wrong methods to fix them. Whenever my parents were in a tight spot financially, their first call was to decrease their spending not borrow money to maintain their spending! Now Arnie points to his campaign promises that he will cut spending after we give him this last and final (remember, politicians' words) loan. Well, to be honest, I'd rather have some sort of financial crisis for a while without bailing the state through a loan. I reckon that if the Legislature and Arnie have no more money to spend, they will just try cutting all the wrong spending that got us in trouble.  Remember, we went from $4 billion in surplus to $35 billion in deficit in just 4 years!   There is another reason that I think voting NO on 57 is good idea. Arnie is a popular governor but he is also someone with interesting (meaning odd) ideas and flimsy campaign promises not to raise taxes. The one thing going for him is his tremendous popularity. But popularity is dangerous when left unchecked. That is why voting NO on 57 would serve to remind Arnie that Californians are not going to accept any idea just because Arnie said so.  I would have voted yes on 58, but since it is tied to prop 57, I am voting no on both.   A note about my choice of the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party:  Edwards is not only a favorite of mine because of professional links (both of us will have JDs after our name, mine coming up soon), but I seriously admire the guy. I think he has a better chance beating Bush than Kerry because of three crucial reasons. First, Edwards is a recent newcomer to the senate and that means that he does not have a lengthy record to be scurtinized through, this is a luxury that Kerry does not have. This point also means that Edwards could easily change his mind about things and not be called a hypocrite. Secondly, Edwards is from the South and can win the South. This is no Al Gore, he does not just claim that his home state (in reality living in DC since the age of 8) is a southeren state, Edwards is really from the south and until recently resided there. Plus Edwards' values and ideas are more aligned to the South than Kerry. Finally, Edwards has the charm! And as Bubba Clinton proved to us, reaching voters with charm and pathos is tremendous political fortune. If you have some time this week, go to Edwards site and see him give one speech. You will be floored!

      I had dinner with a good friend of mine and classmate, Roberto. During our dinner he asked me about my post on the bias of the judge in SF (scroll down to see my comments). He posed this question, “wouldn’t a married judge be also biased?” This is actually a good question, and here is what I think about it. The idea of having judges not be biased is not only there to serve in getting the right decision, but rather it is to make sure that the public can be assured of the  legitimacy  of the judicial system. Imagine that this gay judge found that the state of California did indeed violate the Constitution in requiring marriage to be between a man and woman only, what would the headline in the papers be the next day?  GAY JUDGE FINDS THAT BAN ON GAY MARRIAGES VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION!  People will see that and say, “Aha, the judge made the justice system work out for his benefit.” The big loser here would be the justice system because it will not be deemed to be credible in the eyes of the public. This is a risk that I believe is not worth taking, look at how we view the Supreme Court after  Bush v. Gore , we deem it to be politically biased. And isn’t that the very thing the Framers sought to avoid by having the judiciary as a third branch of government independent from the other two political branches.  On a different note, one can say but a married judge might impose his view about marriage. True, that could happen. But for one, it may cost less on the legitimacy scale and secondly so what! Isn’t that the risk that we run when we ask the courts to read into the Constitution things that are not written explicitly? Isn’t our jurisprudence quickly becoming the idea that we must read into the Constitution societal values? Now the antidote to such problem seems to adopt a view of the jurisprudence that is espoused by Justice Scalia:  If it is not in the text of the Constitution, I can not read it into the text.  That means that societal changes will not happen at the level of the courts but at the level of the legislature where people can debate the issues in a democratic fashion. Remember courts are the most undemocratic institutions, they are not elected, they are not subject to firing and they are insulated from the public by having life tenure. So having a judge reach a decision based on his values is not something that is uncommon, but it is certainly something that is not good. Whether its a conservative or liberal decision is not the issue. The issue is having a legitmate justice system.   Anyways, time to head back to OC (no, not the show but the real OC).

      Okay, here is the deal... Justice Scalia was visting my school on Monday and of course everyone was dying to ask him if he will recuse himself from the Cheney case... I mean the judge and the person who this case matters the most to have been duck hunting together!  Oh the bias!  I am actually leaning towards the opinion that Scalia should recuse himself. Speaking of BIAS, one of the judges who refused to issue an injunction regarding the gay marriages in the anachrist (anachrist but loves the GAP!) county of SF happens to be gay himself... Nah! I am sure he is  NOT  biased!  urlLink Check out the story here ! This does not mean that I agree or disagree with him, I am just curious.

      Terror has arrived in England. Read the story  urlLink here , there are couple of obersvations that I wish to make:  1) The group that was captured in the UK is not linked to Al-Qeda. Before you breathe a breath of relief, think about this. This is actually a sad and scary progression in the war on terror. Being outside of Al-Qeda means that there are more terrorist groups out there which also means that that such groups are probably not on the radar screens of law enforcement. Imagine what we didn't know Al-Qeda after 9-11 and multiply that with an infinite number of possible  other  groups. Indeed these new groups are not probably as organized as Al-Qeda, but they are not any less scary.   2) Most of who were arrested were British nationals and a most of them were born and raised Britain. This issue will raise numerous legal and social problems. Do we deal with them as soldiers of foriegn armies? Do we deal with them as traitors? On a social plane, what do we do to somehow understand where they got such hatred towards their  home  countries? Should we still try to reconcile Islam to our western values?

      Here is an email from an avid reader of this humble blog:   Quite frankly, I think that the public is looking at the Michael Newdow case in the wrong way. I don’t think the Supreme Court will even consider the fact that he doesn't have full custody of his child; all they are looking at is the facts of the case and its legitimacy. Whether the word "under god" really does violate the first amendment and if so if the whole pledge violates the first amendment? Any other atheist father that has full custody of his child can come make the same case so I don’t think his personal background will have anything to do with the facts of the case. I personally believe that the Supreme Court will rule against it considering that the majority is conservative, I think they will say that the word God is doing any harm, its ridiculous.    Lets dissect the claims here for a second:  1) The background serves an important here because of the legal doctrine of "standing". The Supreme Court has maintained that this doctrine prohibits it from interfering in cases where the person who is bringing the suit lacks standing. The idea is that for you to have standing, you must have somehow being "injured" because of the issue of the suit. Here Newdow lacks such claim, because if he is not the custodial father then he can not claim any injury as result of his daughter reciting the pledge.   2) I wish that I can agree that there is a conservative majority on the Court, but such claim is doubtful generally and specifically in this case. First off, Justice Scalia has recused himself from the case, which leaves 8 justices. There is a really possibility that the court may split 4-4 on this one which means that the ruling of the 9th Circuit stands and the states that are under the juridication of that circuit can not use the pledge. The more depressing point about the comment about the conservative justices is that we have ascribed idealogy to judges and have decided that they will always vote according to that idealogy. That is depressing because the Court becomes this political branch and not a bastion of legal, thoughtful and methodical analysis of legal issues.  3) Here is my prediction about what will happen: I think the vote will 8-0 to uphold the pledge, but the reason is not because its constitutional but because either Newdow lacks standing. The second possible reasoning will rest on the idea of tradition. The arguement says that the use of word "God" here is a generic use of the word that is derivative from our traditions. It is not a prayer and its not an endoresement of a religion. This is analogous to a muslim saying the word "Jesus!" when his toe is stubbed. The use of "Jesus" is not meant as a prayer or an endorsement of Christianity but rather because there is a tradition and wide use of God's name in vain!   Any thoughts about this?

       A Utah state trooper pulled over a car traveling the wrong way on Interstate 15  near the town of Beaver early Wednesday morning, figuring he'd find just another drunk driver.   Instead, he discovered a 49-year-old Whittier, Calif., man and his mother, who thought they were still in the Los Angeles area.   "When I told them they were in Utah, they insisted they were only 10 miles from their house," sheriff's Sgt. David Mott told the Salt Lake Tribune. "They looked at me like I was out of my mind."   Mott said the man and his 78-year-old mother seemed disoriented. They'd left their home to go to the car mechanic 18 hours earlier.   I-15 runs north from San Diego through the eastern part of the greater Los Angeles area, though why the wayward pair went 450 miles out of their way was not explained.   Mott found no evidence of alcohol or drug use, so he took the pair to a local hospital for observation. They checked out OK.   Beaver County Sheriff Ken Yardley put the man and his mother up in a local motel for the night, then let them head home after a good night's rest.    urlLink FOXNews.com - Foxlife - Out There - Mother, I Think We May Have Missed a Turn

       President Bush poked fun at his staff, his Democratic challenger and himself Wednesday night at a black-tie dinner where he hobnobbed with the news media.   Bush put on a slide show, calling it the ``White House Election-Year Album'' at the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association 60th annual dinner, showing himself and his staff in some decidedly unflattering poses.     There was Bush looking under furniture in a fruitless, frustrating search. ``Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere,'' he said.   There was Vice President Dick Cheney, a frequent butt of gentle Bush ribbing, holding his fingers a few inches apart. Bush said, ``Whenever you ask him a question, he replies, 'Let's see what my little friend says.'''    And there was Bush again, in an odd contortion in front of his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. He said he was trying to explain to her the foreign policy of Democratic challenger John Kerry.    Bush showed himself playing cards on Air Force One and cracked that he was on his way to an international summit and using a special deck to help him bone up on the names of the leaders he was about to meet.    His slide show segued into a somber ending, showing a group of special forces troops in Afghanistan at the site where they buried a piece of the fallen World Trade Center in commemoration of the dead from Sept. 11.    The late NBC News reporter David Bloom, who died in April from an apparent blood clot while covering the Iraq war, was remembered. His wife, Melanie, talked of her husband's passion for journalism.    About 1,500 guests attended the dinner.

      Well, I have been enjoying my spring break! It has been a sweet time where I am getting to do some othe things that I have not been able to do for a long time. Did some yard work, saw some beautiful flowers bloom and spread some seeds for new ones. Learned the importance of maintaining the correct pH to have algae free swimming pool. But more importantly got to connect with some close friends and got to read something that is not law related! I started reading a tome about the history of the CIA, and the simplest characterization of it is that this book is fascinating! Check out these cool facts:   During the cold war, the CIA wanted to engage the Soviets in psychological warfare. Their brilliant idea? Well, they wanted to flood the USSSR with XL condoms in a packaging that labeled some as mediums! The idea was to influence both genders of the Russians. The males will feel short, whereas the females will feel short changed!   One of the brilliant ways that the CIA wanted to induce revolution against Castro in Cuba was by surrounding the island with submarines that at a given moment will all put on an amazing firework display. Why? The idea was to convince the religiously inclined Cubans that the second coming of Christ has began and therefore Castro was the anti- Christ!   Stay tuned for some posts about my disillusionment with Law School, the terror in Spain and some random and crazy thoughts about faith, CIA and life!

      Here is the latest bright idea in the California legislature:  A proposed amendment to California's constitution would give 16-year-olds a half-vote and 14-year-olds a quarter-vote in state elections.  The first thought that came to mind when I read this was that this is somehow tied to the abortion issue. A fetus is not considered a person, but the older you get, you can slowly gain personhood. Is that the underlying value here? Maybe.   urlLink California lawmakers propose lowering voting age to 14 for state elections

      David Kuo in the LA Times has this million dollar quote:   "The Passion's" Jesus, however, isn't convenient. In fact, he makes me very, very uncomfortable. That Jesus isn't moldable, pliable, malleable — not even huggable. He's determined. He knows who he is and why he's doing what he's doing. He rebukes Peter, silently mocks Pilate, defies his captors and never whimpers. Forget William Wallace; this guy is tough.  Maybe, just maybe, Jesus the movie is closer to Jesus the book. Maybe he doesn't give a flip about balanced budgets, trade imbalances and interest rates. Maybe he took the lashes of hell for a reason that wasn't material in any way. Maybe he meant what he said about caring for the poor — that loving him requires it. Or about wealth — that it is really, really, really hard for the rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Or about profiteering in his Father's house — that it is a remarkably bad idea with suboptimal long-term outcomes. Or even about himself — that he is "the way, the truth and the life."   "The Passion" is so hard because it presents Jesus as we've never seen him and reveals a truth: Come face to face with Jesus in any way and prepare to squirm, or maybe even to hate him. He arouses that kind of passion and should make all of us who use his name for anything be very, very careful.

      It has been a long day, and so I could not post anything today. Between an early interview and talking to prospective employers, I am drained. So sorry, none of the Hani mental juice today. A second apology. I have been put on notice by some observant readers regarding my many typos. For those I apologize. This is has been a flaw in my writing for a while, I think too fast and write even faster, thus sacrificing serious editting. I do know how to write ENGLISH! This flaw is actually part of what encouraged me to start this blog, I want to force myself to write everyday to remedy such flaw (and many others). Thank you for your patience during the whole process. And thank you for taking time to read this blog. If you like it, spread the word around.

      Million Dollar Quote:  The compromise on the role of Islam is particularly unconvincing and could prove to be a time bomb. The provision on the role of religion is riddled with contradictions. Islam is "a source of legislation," but not the sole source. The document, however, is careful not to name other sources of legislation.  Under the interim constitution, no law can be adopted which is inconsistent with the basic principles of Islam, which implies an Islamic veto on legislation.  Yet the document goes on to say that no law can be adopted which contravenes democratic principles or civil rights, a counter veto to that handed to the Islamists.  The contradiction may not be apparent to American diplomats who repeat the claim religion is not incompatible with democracy like a mantra, but the inconsistency is obvious to secular Iraqis, particularly women and the Iraqi Kurds.    I am planning to start a petition to be sent to the White House at the end of this month. If you are Middle Eastern Christian and would like to sign it, email me and I will mail you a copy of the signature page. I am aiming at 300 signatures for now, but I have a feeling that as this issue is debated more and more, people will sign this petition. It is amazing how Americans have such a low understanding of the dangers of radical Islam and how it can be fit into the context of a democracy.

      According to Kerry, yes, and he wants to be the second:  "President Clinton was often known as the first black president. I wouldn't be upset if I could earn the right to be the second,"    That is so true... Clinton had the first black secartary of state, first national security adviser and first secertary of education, correct? Nope, its Mr. Bush who did, but nah he could not be the first black president, he does not know how to preach it like Bubba and Gore!   urlLink Yahoo!

      The answer: A STUPID liar... Check out this excerpt from the life of Jayson Blair, the disgraced NY Times reporter:   In one episode, no one at the Diamondback could reach Blair for three days. When he resurfaced, says Kristi E. Swartz, then a friend who was working on the Diamondback, Blair told several newspaper staffers that he had blacked out because of a gas leak at his room.  The story couldn't have been true; his dormitory was not supplied with natural gas.   Read the rest of the story, its fun but ultimatly sad. The fall of the Newspaper of Record was ultimately proven at the hand of this man. (Hat Tip: Jeremy's Weblog)   urlLink baltimoresun.com - The making of Jayson Blair

       A clause was included underlining that no legislation will be passed that contravenes the tenets of Islam.   Do you want to guess where the above mentioned clause will be inserted? The NEW and USA  approved  provisional constitution of Iraq. Now please let me understand this. We find no WMDs (Weapons of Mass Destruction) and so we are told that the second reason for going to war is to establish the first democracy in the Middle East. And now we have a CONSTITUTION that recongize that ISLAM is the FINAL check against any law to be passed? So if we want to propose a law that allows for religious conversion, guess what established law will contradict that? ISLAM. And if we want to pass a law saying that marriage is one man to one woman, what law will say no? ISLAM. Because Islam is not simply a religion relegated to private practice. Islam is a social system that dictates everything in our daily life. Islam says man could marry 4, so marrying 4 will be the rule. Now please tell me, is that the improvement that president Bush promised us. Is that what we get for 500+ dead soldiers, thousands of dead Iraqis and over $200 billion dollars? Dang it, why not just have asked Iran to go in and invade Saddam. This president is really close to having stay at home and not vote in november.

      The most popular reality TV show,  Al Hawa Sawa , has been shut off. Bad ratings? No, try flouting the rule of the traditional Islam:   Viewers of Al Hawa Sawa suspected in January that three of the eight girls from around the Arab world taking part in the show were secretly smoking, flouting a ban on cigarettes and alcohol in the luxury Beirut apartment they moved into in December.   Oh the horror! The show seems to be very funny, because the way it tries to tiptoe around Islam. But notice the bigger problem that the article seems to refer to. The main problem seems to be that the contestant are getting to choose to marry on thier own.  urlLink OH THE HORROR!

      The  urlLink New York Observer  makes a stronger case than the Village Voice, but it's the same conclusion: Kerry Must Go! Money Example:   Take a look, for example, at NBC’s Meet the Press on April 18. Tim Russert aired a tape of Senator John Kerry’s appearance on the show 33 years earlier, when he was a young, jut-chinned veteran, 27 years old, full of baleful gravity, expressing a sense of shame for his actions in Vietnam. The camera cut back to Senator Kerry, now a man running for President of United States.  "You committed atrocities," said Mr. Russert gravely, asking Mr. Kerry to address the statements of the young man on the screen.  Suddenly, the current John Kerry, of 2004, gave a stumbling, inexplicable guffaw.  "Where did all that dark hair go, Tim? That’s a big question for me."  And suddenly, inexplicably, the question showed up: Where did all that gravitas go, John? That’s the big question for the viewer. The appealing young veteran disappeared, the angry, vengeful Democratic candidate disappeared, and John Kerry, the callow Swiss-prep-school boy returned, as vividly as George Bush the smirking frat boy makes his appearances on national television. "Awful," said MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. "Just awful."   Folks maybe this election is going to be Hillary v. Bush after all....

      James Ridgeway from the  urlLink Village Voice  has this about Kerry:   WASHINGTON, D.C.— With the air gushing out of John Kerry's balloon, it may be only a matter of time until political insiders in Washington face the dread reality that the junior senator from Massachusetts doesn't have what it takes to win and has got to go. As arrogant and out of it as the Democratic political establishment is, even these pols know the party's got to have someone to run against George Bush. They can't exactly expect the president to self-destruct into thin air.   With growing issues over his wealth (which makes fellow plutocrat Bush seem a charity case by comparison), the miasma over his medals and ribbons (or ribbons and medals), his uninspiring record in the Senate (yes war, no war), and wishy-washy efforts to mimic Bill Clinton's triangulation gimmickry (the protractor factor), Kerry sinks day by day. The pros all know that the candidate who starts each morning by having to explain himself is a goner.   What to do? Look for the Dem biggies, whoever they are these days, to sit down with the rich and arrogant presumptive nominee and try to persuade him to take a hike. Then they can return to business as usual—resurrecting John Edwards, who is still hanging around, or staging an open convention in Boston, or both.   If things proceed as they are, the dim-bulb Dem leaders are going to be very sorry they screwed Howard Dean   This is big, the Voice is a  liberal  magazine.  So my friends who doubted my analysis that Kerry will implode, do you believe now or do you still this gut will become the prez?

      From my  urlLink devotions  last night:    Have you heard the tale of the aloe plant, Away in the sunny clime? By humble growth of a hundred years It reaches its blooming time; And then a wondrous bud at its crown Breaks into a thousand flowers; This floral queen, in its blooming seen, Is the pride of the tropical bowers, But the plant to the flower is sacrifice, For it blooms but once, and it dies.  Have you further heard of the aloe plant, That grows in the sunny clime; How every one of its thousand flowers, As they drop in the blooming time, Is an infant plant that fastens its roots In the place where it falls on the ground, And as fast as they drop from the dying stem, Grow lively and lovely around? By dying, it liveth a thousand-fold In the young that spring from the death of the old.  Have you heard the tale of the pelican, The Arabs' Gimel el Bahr, That lives in the African solitudes, Where the birds that live lonely are? Have you heard how it loves its tender young, And cares and toils for their good, It brings them water from mountain far, And fishes the seas for their food. In famine it feeds them--what love can devise! The blood of its bosom--and, feeding them, dies.  Have you heard this tale--the best of them all-- The tale of the Holy and True, He dies, but His life, in untold souls Lives on in the world anew; His seed prevails, and is filling the earth, As the stars fill the sky above. He taught us to yield up the love of life, For the sake of the life of love. His death is our life, His loss is our gain; The joy for the tear, the peace f or the pain.

      A prayer that touched my heart:   Too late have I loved you, O Beauty so ancient, O Beauty so new. Too late have I loved you! You were within me but I was outside myself, and there I sought you! In my weakness I ran after the beauty of the things you have made. You were with me, and I was not with you. The things you have made kept me from you - the things which would have no being unless they existed in you! You have called, you have cried, and you have pierced my deafness. You have radiated forth, you have shined out brightly, and you have dispelled my blindness. You have sent forth your fragrance, and I have breathed it in, and I long for you. I have tasted you, and I hunger and thirst for you. You have touched me, and I ardently desire your peace.

      From  urlLink here :   On April 27, the finalists of FOX's "American Idol" will release a singles collection titled "Greatest Soul Classics." That album will, almost certainly, outsell "Inspiration," the first recording by "Idol" reject William Hung. However, the finalists will have had to go to all the extra trouble of knowing how to sing, while Hung has hit the charts just being himself.  Hung's album debuted at No. 34 on the latest Billboard 200 pop albums chart. Early estimates actually had insiders guessing that Hung would debut in the Top 30, based on sales of between 30,000 and 40,000 copies.  While that debut came in more than 400,000 records behind Usher's chart-topping "Confessions," it was nearly on par with the latest release by future "Idol" guest judge Barry Manilow.  The undertalented Hung was a University of California, Berkeley civil engineering major when he went to the San Francisco try-outs for FOX's popular talent show. His hilariously off-key performance and gracious acceptance of judge Simon Cowell's insults won him a legion of fans.  Hung signed a contract with Koch Records in March. At the time, Alan Grunblatt, the company's general manager and executive vice president, described him as "The New Elvis."  Despite an absence of even an iota of vocal talent, Hung's cover of Ricky Martin's "She Bangs" has become an anthem for overachievers everywhere including the Los Angeles Dodgers who won four straight games playing Hung in their clubhouse. As soon as different music was selected, the team promptly lost.

      As may of you know,  urlLink U2  is my favorite band. I can mention countless days where my life was transformed by thier music. And as many of you also know, U2 origins was very much faith oriented. I am linking to an article that deals with the implications of U2's music on the life of faith. Here is an interesting quote explaining the relationship of U2 and the Christian Faith:   In the '80s, U2 was known for being very straight ahead social justice, change the world, get out there and wave your white flag, and by the end of the '80s they were much critiqued for that self-righteousness. They completely re-invented themselves in the '90s, borrowing a page from C.S. Lewis's Screwtape Letters, and became the band of irony. At the end of the '90s, as the millennium came, they went back, in a sense, to wearing their heart on their sleeves with their most recent album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, which retains some of that subtlety and nuance that we came to associate with U2 in the '90s, but is also much more straight ahead about basic human values.

      Jeremy has this scary  urlLink post  about a "Job Advice" session that he went to in Harvard. I am copying it in its entirety because it is worth reading. I haven't actually heard similar things here at USD, but I know that the spirit that Jeremy observes behind the comments lurks in my beloved catholic institution. This is really scary...  Here is the post, thank you Jeremy:  "Go to firm social events, and collect information from what people say when they're drunk - but you can't be hammered yourself." This is apparently what the Office of Career Services exists to tell us. At today's session, "What Law School Doesn't Teach You, But You Really Ought To Know," I learned that I should spend my summer lying, manipulating, brown-nosing, scheming, and "the most important rule: don't be yourself" in order to ensure my law firm success. Aside from the shameful fact that there are actually people who will take this advice and become just a few more examples of why people hate lawyers, it's even more shameful that the school has its name on the session. If my tuition is paying for this, I want my money back. We should aim higher than this.  "I'm going to teach you how to turn fabulous opportunities into great careers," we were told. And how to turn pounds of raw meat into delicious beef jerky in just twenty-five minutes with the brand-new, state-of-the-art deluxe Food Dehydrator. "It's not how smart you are. It's how smart people think you are. It's not how hard you work - it's how hard people think you work." Come on. "Don't be yourself, and don't follow your instincts." In other words, be phony and disingenuous. Exactly the kind of person everyone loves to be around.  "Students often ruin their image by making casual comments around the office. If someone asks you how you like the job, say 'I'm learning a lot,' even if what you're thinking is 'I'm learning a lot about how I don't want to work here.'" At this point in the session, I was learning a lot. I was learning a lot about sad the world is, and how pathetic it is that someone thought this was something students would benefit from. Here are some more things I'm going to say when they ask me how my summer is going - not lies, of course - just ways of "disguising the truth" - "I've never had an experience quite like this," "It's certainly been something," "What a great question," and "Pardon? I'm not quite sure I caught that."  "Always carry a copy of the evaluation criteria with you - so you can constantly check that you're getting the right experience. Keep a file, and write down every compliment you get." November 13, 1:25 P.M. Paralegal said she liked my tie. November 14, 2:03 P.M. Senior partner thanked me for holding the door for him. November 15, 9:17 A.M. Fifth-year associate said I have nice penmanship. What exactly is the file for? Creeping people out, or evidence for the wrongful termination lawsuit after you're accidentally "yourself" one day and tell someone you think you might be coming down with a cold. Tsk, tsk.  "Make friends with the support staff to get gossip... one associate [bribed them with] muffins every week." Wait, wait, wait - so you're not supposed to make real friends at work - "work is not a confessional" - but you're supposed to make friends to the extent they can feed you gossip (if you feed them muffins). Got it. Personal integrity, no, I don't think you're part of this session, sorry.  "Never get defensive when people are criticizing your work." "If someone comes back to you and says you did something wrong, you should just show them the e-mail you sent them to confirm the assignment, and prove [they're the ones wrong]." Uh, consistency? "Not my fault - the e-mail I sent you said THIS!" sounds pretty defensive to me.  Bottom line: I think this stuff is awful. I think that the law school underestimates us if they think any advice like this is helpful advice, and should be ashamed if they think that this advice in particular is appropriate, dignified, or even any good. The workplace environment the speaker would like us to create is an environment I can't imagine anyone finding fulfilling, enjoyable, or even tolerable, whether a law firm or any place of business. My "most important rule" from now on: don't go to sessions like these (unless you need to write a column).

      This is a FUNNY story, Happy and any other  BraveHeart  lovers will love it!  FALLUJAH, Iraq (AP) -- Amid the clatter of gunfire and explosions that regularly rock this city, an unexpected sound rises over the front line - bagpipes.  Dressed in Marine fatigues with his gun at his side, 1st Sgt. Dwayne Farr, 36, blows into his set of pipes. The plaintive wail is carried by the wind that whips across this dust-blown, war-torn town. "Playing on the battlefield - I never thought that would happen," Farr said. Farr, an African-American from Detroit, was inspired to learn when he saw another player who didn't match the Scotsman stereotype.  "I was at a funeral and I saw a Marine playing the bagpipes, and I thought, this isn't a big, burly, redheaded guy with a ponytail and a big stomach. He's a small Hispanic Marine. I said if he can learn to play the bagpipes, I can learn," he said, chuckling.   When he is not on the front-line, Farr wears a kilt when playing, and some Marines have been skeptical about a member of one of the toughest fighting forces in the world donning what looks like a skirt. But Farr is unfazed.  He's looking for a desert camouflage kilt he can wear in operations like these.   "Kilts are something that fighting men wore many years ago, and we know that the Marines are fighting men. So real men wear kilts. And they are pretty comfortable too," he said. Among his admittedly limited repertoire is "taps," the tune traditionally played by the military when a service member is killed. Farr has played it several times over the past days in Fallujah. Marines say the sound of the bagpipes is a morale booster.  "It's something to hear besides the rockets and gunfire," said Master Sgt. Rowland Salinas, 42, from San Antonio, Texas. "It's something that soothes the mind."

      Here is a story from  Healing Iraq  that illustrates the bias of arabic media. This story sorta hit home for me because its the University that my mom used to teach in for 10 years. I spent many summers there where she tutored me in my studies. Here is the money quote:   Arab satellite channels reported today that Al-Mustansiriyah university was under siege by US troops. We have a neighbour who is a professor there, so as expected we raced to his house when we had heard about it. We congratulated him for his safety, but he looked significantly surprised and asked us what was up? We told him about the siege. He chuckled at us and said "Oh, you mean that". It turned out there was no siege at all, there was an American patrol in the vicinity of the university, and they had witnessed someone climbing on the clock tower trying to paste a large poster of Muqtada Al-Sadr. The patrol called for backup, entered the campus and hollered for the fellow to come down. They teared the poster and removed a few others close to the university's main entry gates. According to our friend, the whole process didn't take any more than 20 minutes. Just to show how the Arab media conveniently distort events.

      I just came back from celebrating Good Friday at church. It was a powerful service, and it focused so much on the good that Christ has accomplished with his death on the cross. Absent from it though, was a discussion about how evil seemed to have triumphed over Christ even if for 3 days (until the resurrection).  That is a significance of Good Friday that is lost among our focus on the ultimate triumph of Christ over sin. We lose sight of the fact that evil has pained the good, and for a moment there evil seemed to be a winner. Please imagine yourself living in Israel during the time of Christ. A follower of Christ, a believer that life will be radically changed and that as humans we will lose the scourge of sin and go back to being in the image of God again. What would have been your thoughts about what happened to Christ? Would your dreams and hope for salvation be dashed because the Messiah is hanging there on a cross? Would you despair? Would you curse? Would you give up?   There are many aspects of life that seem to be going through this “Friday” stage, where evil seems to have the upper hand. Just think internationally for a moment. Think about Iraq; think about those who hoped for freedom from a despot to find themselves in the hands of newer despots. Think about the genocide in Rwanda, think about a 1 million lives hacked out because they belong to a different tribe. Think about slaves still sold in Sudan. Think about AIDS and Africa.   Now take your thoughts to your locality. Think about those girls that are forced to prostitute their cherished sexuality so they can eat and love. Think about single mothers who are trying to collect from deadbeat dads. Think about abused kids and mothers. Think about a man who wants to work but can not find one or can not get enough out of his job. Think about those who have been unjustly accused but do not have the resources to pay for a defense. Think about the hospital wards full of Cancer, AIDS, Hepatitatis, Diabetes etc. patients. Think about those kids bullied at school.   Now please take this idea home and think about yourself. Think about how complacent you have become with seeing evil around you in the world and at home, but doing nothing. Think about how you put yourself above everything and everyone else. Finally think whether as someone who is living a life that was given to you as a gift; you have been faithful in using this life to eradicate evil.  Good Friday is about Christ suffering through evil because he seeks to save humans from being enslaved to sin. It’s about his sacrifice so we can be free from the pain of evil, so we can be HUMANS again and not some selfish primate that happens to think, talk and feel. Good Friday is also about Christ saying that great things such as peace, love and glory come out of sacrifice. How then can we stay silent in the face of evil that surrounds us? How can we?   ( An important note here, this message is addressed to me before any of you.)

      I want to make a few notes about my post about freedom (look  urlLink here ). Actually it was something that was brought to my attention by some emailers. When I argued that Freedom without order is not something to be always desired, I did not make clear what I meant by "order". One cane point that under the reign of Hitler or Saddam, their respective countries did have "order". One even can argue that if AL Sadr takes power in Iraq, he will bring order to the country using the Islamic Shar'ia (law). But that is the not the kind of order that I spoke about. In my discussion of concepts such freedom and order, you must realize that my desire is to see humans prosper as the way human should. I am not talking prospering financially only, but I am talking about every aspect of us that makes us humans and not animals. As humans we must be given order and freedom to develop our minds, invent new things, stimulate our intellect, advance the cause of the weak and the oppressed and finally just be darn humans that are created in the image of God! So in essence what I am saying is this, yes we should have order but it has to be order that enahances us as humans and makes us better on the long run. That is why the order that comes from the likes of Hitler, Saddam or even the repression of Islam is not the kind of order that I speak of. It does not bring about freedom, it brings about repression and makes human less of humans and more of  animals . Now the bigger question is this: What is it that definese a better human? This question will not be answered here because it has been the interest of Philosophers for centuries. But I am sure that we can agree on certain things that make humans a little bit better i.e. the rights of women to vote, the equality of all races and the freedom of speaking your own mind etc.

      I am taking a class in International Law with a brilliant professor. Want to know how brilliant he is, see if you can understand this quote, it took me a while to get it. Professor Schwarzchild is a treasure of experience, thoughts and intellect. Here is a bushbush:    Having enjoyed the Passover seders this week, I stole off last night to hear Tenebrae, the Holy Thursday rite. It was sung in the High Renaissance polyphony of Tomas Luis de Victoria -- by the Tomas Luis de Victoria Choir of San Diego, no less. This was the authentic Tridentine Latin liturgy, making an improbable appearance at a neighbourhood Catholic Church in San Diego. The intricate, sonorous polyphonic music is gorgeous even when the singing is a little shaky. And Tenebrae is one of the great poetic rituals of the Roman Catholic year: "Quomodo sedet sola civitas..." ("How lonely sits the bereaved city...")      urlLink The Right Coast

      So I am having trouble going to sleep so I get my newspaper ( I am stuck with the LA times) and then I read this pathetic review of the new Alamo movie. It simply enraged me, check out this zinger:    I haven't seen the movie — which opens today — and I might not. I want to, but not for the reason most Texans will: a nationalism that parallels the fundamentalism of a lot of the Christians going to "The Passion of the Christ." (I can only imagine how uncomfortable, even defensive, Jewish people must feel about going or not going to see that.)    Excuse me??Where in the world did this come from? Notice the assumption here, that it is only fundamentalists that watched the Passion. Now that got my mind thinking... the movie made about $300 million dollars. Okay, now factor in that a ticket costs $8  so that means there were 37.5 million tickets sold. Are you telling me that there are 37.5 million fundamentalists in the US ? Then why the hell did Bush lose the popular vote in the last election?    Now look at the next gem from the same article when addressing why he really does not like the movie. The message of the movie to him is:    Mexicans were bad and should go "home," even though home was where they already were.    Ahh!!!! So this is the real problem that pissed our beloved author off. He does not believe that the portions of America that used to belong to Mexico actually do belong to America. This tired old line about how this land was robbed or "raped" needs to stop. One only has to cross the borders a few feet at TJ to wonder why wasn't more land stolen!   There is another point that is implicit in the article. The article makes mention of Red necks, KKK members, Texas nationalist.... and, and, and..... CHRISTIANS. Hmm.  Finally here is another zinger from the article, comparing men that defended their homes to drunkard, abusive stepfathers:    But for Mexican Americans, the Alamo, even at its best, is about "them," not us, about how heroic "they" are, in the land where we both still live. Celebrating Crockett and Jim Bowie, for us, is like someone reveling in the story of our drunk, abusive stepfather.      If you want to read the rest of the review, trudge your way  urlLink here .

      My  urlLink brother  has a post about what is going on in Iraq. Beside the theological question that he ends his post with, I want to discuss another issue that is mentioned in the post. Happy makes the point that the big issue in Iraq right now is that the society there does not know how to handle freedom and the cost that is associated with it. But I believe that the real issue is not whether a society wants to be free or not, but whether when freedom is balanced with order, freedom should be our choice. I beg to differ with that because it seems that people choose freedom for the higher goal of having order (i.e. the ability to work, live and prosper as humans are intended to.) This point is illustarted the works of Hobbes and Locke, where they point out that humans will choose to give up part of their freedom to have a law abiding society. This social contract makes the arguement that above all humans want order rather freedom that only brings lawlessness. This paradigm is also seen in a country like Singapore. For those who do not know, Singpore was ruled for 30+ years by a dictator, and many scholars point that Singapore fails miserably if measured by our standards of what freedom should look like. (You know if you land in Singapore with long hair, you will not be permitted to leave the airport without a hair cut, gum is not sold on the island, if you are caught using a public bathroom without flushing, you will be fined etc.) But ask the people of Singapore if they are happy and they will say YES! They like order, they like the fact that the island has prospered and made advances like no other.  That is why I believe the struggle in Iraq has to do with more than the issue of freedom, it has to do with order. The key of course is how much order do we want and how much freedom we are willing to sacrifice. Right now the Iraqis are saying "screw freedom, get me some order." And who can blame them?  I am not saying that things under Saddam were better, far be it. But what I am saying is this: We want to change Iraq and let them become a democracy? Then do it by maintaining order and then give them freedom.

       This is a part of a series of posts that deal with the upcoming celebration of Easter.    Today, Thursday, is the day that traditionally Christians celebrate to be the last supper that Christ had with his followers. It is during this dinner that Christ drops the final hint that he is soon to be crucified. But I believe that the significance of today lies in an event that occurred after that supper. Namely it was the time that Christ wrestled in prayer with his Father regarding going to the cross. This is the crux of Christ's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane. It was a struggle of wills. Jesus as God had full knowledge of the horrors of the cross, the physical horrors and the spiritual horrors. We focus alot only on the fact that Christ suffered  physically on the cross, forgetting that Christ suffered a seperation from his eternal Father because he carried the sin of the world. Furthermore, the WRATH of God fell upon Christ on that cross. The WRATH that God had on every sin that was committed and every sin to come. This was dreadful.   But back to the garden. The struggle in the garden was crucial because in it we see the agony of Christ about what is going to happen and finally we see the amazing obedience that Christ performed in submitting to the will of his Father. I wonder how painful that was? But it was done because Christ loved his Father and furthermore loved us literally to death.  Please take time to today and ponder the struggle that Christ went through. Reflect on the cost that he was precieving. Furthemore reflect on what obedience to God means in your life. You may find this article by  urlLink Greg Laurie  helpful as you ponder your own obedience (click  urlLink here  for the article).  In the mean time,  urlLink read  and meditate on what acually happened in the garden:   "And He came out and proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him. When He arrived at the place, He said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation." And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and began to pray, saying, "Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done." Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him. And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground."

      Many of you know that I am disenchanted with law school and the amount of ignornace that I found there. I am not talking about being smart, but there is a certain of ignorance in law school that makes students apathetic to anything that is not grade oriented or money oriented. One of the few exceptions to this attitude has been my great friend Roberto. I kid you not when I say that only he makes my staying at law school bearable. Roberto has an amazing understanding of the world and the forces that shape it. He also has a gentle and sweet heart, and so I was taken back when I recieved the following email from him. You can say that the situation in Iraq has ignited the passions of Bobby and he makes some great points, some even coming from personal experinece with another dreadful dictatorship (Argentina). I am posting Bobby's email, uneditted, because I thought it is important to see both the pathos that he has and the arguments that he makes. These are not the rantings of a mad man, but they are the heart cry of broken heart to fellow citizens in this god forsaken world. Thank you Bobby for putting in words what I feel:   It’s funny to see the latest blogs you put up. I was driving down form LA today and thinking about the exact same things. I thought what the hell is going on in Iraq and who the "fuck" is this "asshole” Al Sadr. Then I began to think, well you know what they can all go to hell. If they don’t care enough about themselves then why should I care?  Why should our government care? Why should we spend billions of dollars on people who do not want to be helped! Then I remembered my cousins EX-fiancé in Argentina. He worked as a contractor for the Military, selling and buying weapons; really patriotic, kinda irrational hot headed guy (notice my emphasis on the ex). I remembered he told me  something that I would never have expected a Yaqui hating goon like him to say, he told me that if the United States would come down to Argentina and colonize them he would be the first to welcome them. He said he would even help them raise the American flag over the capitol building in Buenos Aires. Wow, you don’t know how shocking that is to hear, let the US colonize Argentina! The point is that since him, I have heard many people from Argentina say pretty much the same thing. That’s because people there are sick of bullshit, they just want to live in a stable place. There has never really ever been much stability there and people would love to have some for once, even at the price of national identity. Because really what is the use of nationalism (and Sectarianism in Iraq for that matter) if you can’t eat, can’t clothe your family, or walk down to the corner without getting shot. What is the point of having a Shia power structure, if you’re dead, or your child gets blown up on the way to the store? What’s the point ? The only people who benefit are the Al Saders, Peronists (Hani’s note: Peronist is a ruling party in Argentina, think Evita) or whatever other political organization you want to mention. I came to the conclusion that we should pull out and let them suffer at their own hands, if they hate democracy and the west or whatever so much they can lay the bed of their own demise. But I later came to the conclusion, that most in Iraq don’t want the Al Sadrs or anyone else, they want the US there, not because it is the US or anyone else. The problem is that those people are too afraid to fight and stand up to the criminals, they are normal people, who want their kids to be safe and want to do the right things, but how can you fight and stand up for what you believe if you will die for it. This convinces me that we can’t leave we have to be there to stand up for the good people, the people who want progress and peace, because they can’t do it for themselves and because we can.

      There is a battle going on in the streets of Baghdad. From what I have been reading about it in the many Iraqi blogs, its a scary battle. It is so scary that it leaves this blogger with these sentiments:   I have to admit that until now I have never longed for the days of Saddam, but now I'm not so sure. If we need a person like Saddam to keep those rabid dogs at bay then be it. Put Saddam back in power and after he fills a couple hundred more mass graves with those criminals they can start wailing and crying again for liberation. What a laugh we will have then. Then they can shove their filthy Hawza and marji'iya up somewhere else. I am so dissapointed in Iraqis and I hate myself for thinking this way. We are not worth your trouble, take back your billions of dollars and give us Saddam again. We truly 'deserve' leaders like Saddam.   Sad. This really ripped my heart out.   urlLink Healing Iraq :

      To my joy, I discovered that there are a number of blogs running from Iraq. Having being born and raised there, it was almost like an acid trip ( I never tried acid before, I am going with general sentiments here) to see Iraqis in the middle of Iraq speak freely about politics and so on. I will create a permanant link to these blogs soon, but for now read this Iraqi Blogger analysis of what is going on with the Shitties (no, I did not spell that wrong). Here is the money quote:   Iraqis know very well who those 'pious' people are. They are gangsters, rapists, murderers, thieves, kidnappers, looters, and criminals. They are only using religion as cover. I can't even dream of what would happen if those people were left to make trouble on our streets that way without punishment. I believe that it's now time for Al-Sadr to experience a very bad accident soon. We will be sorry for him I assure you, "Oh poor fellow, what a terrible misfortune, what a great loss" we would say to each other knowingly. It's scenes like these that make me sometimes wonder to myself if Saddam wasn't justified in assassinating all those clerics. Get that new Mukhabarat working.     urlLink Healing Iraq

I hope that this blog becomes a hotspot of discussion about things that concern people of faith or people who know people that have faith or people that have no faith or maybe Faith Hill.

      My friend Athar of  urlLink Asoorah's  World  writes about a recent failure in one her classes   God told me loud and clear that I couldn't do it alone and I needed his help. "not by power, nor by might, but by my spirit declares the lord." This teaching isn't something new to me, but its a trap that I repeatedly fall into without realizing it.   I sort of disagreed with her and here is my response   Athar, This is a valuable lesson but I want to perhaps divert your attention to something else. We, as christians, have a tendency to dismiss any failures to be as a result of us doing something wrong. So for example, you viewed your grade to be the result of you doing something wrong in your relationship with God. That could be true, and yes God does ALLOW failures so we can learn something new from it. But I think we forget that God sometimes WANTS us to fail in certain things because it is good for us on the wrong kind. I know that the difference between allowing and wanting is subtle, but I think it is huge. God allowing something means that he doesn't necessarily agree, and God wanting something means he does agree with it. Why would God allow failure? I think its because as humans we only focus on the things that are happening now, whereas God sees our whole life. God's purpose for us is not small moments of happiness but his goal is a life transformed into His image, and if that requires some failure along the way, so be it.  I really encourage you to think of what happened along these lines...

      Okay, now I am getting bored with my vacation. I can not wait for my summer class to start this Thursday and for work to kick in high gear next Tuesday. I know that these words will come and bite me in the butt, but I am at point of life where doing something actively is the only thing that can keep me sane.   But I wanted to post some thoughts regarding my second year experiences. Grades are coming out today, so I am bit terrified and a bit relieved. If I am gonna get screwed, lets get on with it.  Law school this year has been somehow better than last year. For one, I had a decent GPA so as not to be terrified that I might get kick out, as such was the case in 1 L. And to tell you the truth, law school is all about grades. That is the sad reality and the thing that drives me insane. The equation goes something like this:   High Grades = Better Jobs = More Money = More Potential   Do you see the problem? Law school is not like any graduate school (maybe like a MBA) because the education is only a means to an end. And the end is clear: making more money. This creates the law culture that I can not stand. A minority of the students really care about the content of what they are studying, they just want to learn it so they could be masters of it and get paid accordingly. Furthermore, the idea of doing justice is so foreign to law students, justice comes very late in the consideration of why we do law. The end result of this is that the law school culture is very interesting, competitive is not the word of it, think more kniving.   And there is a risk to pursuing money and fame all your life, this risk is best put by Professor Stephen Carter of Yale in his novel  The Emperor of Ocean Park    Our students… will soon be espoused to huge corporate law firms, massive profit factories, where they will bill clients at ridiculous rates for two thousand hours of work every year, quickly earning twice as much money as the best of their teachers, and 	at half the age, sacrificing all on the alter of career, moving relentlessly upward, as ideology and family life collapse equally around them, and at last arriving, a decade or two later, cynical and bitter, at their cherished career goals, partnerships, professorships, judgeships, whatever kind of ships they dream of sailing, and then looking around at the 	angry, empty waters and realizing that they have arrived with nothing, absolutely nothing, 	and wondering what to do with the rest of their wretched lives.

      From  urlLink Fred Barnes :   A FEW YEARS AGO Michael Moore, who's now promoting an anti-President Bush movie entitled Fahrenheit 9/11, announced he'd gotten the goods on me, indeed hung me out to dry on my own words. It was in his first bestselling book, Stupid White Men. Moore wrote he'd once been "forced" to listen to my comments on a TV chat show, The McLaughlin Group. I had whined "on and on about the sorry state of American education," Moore said, and wound up by bellowing: "These kids don't even know what The Iliad and The Odyssey are!"  Moore's interest was piqued, so the next day he said he called me. "Fred," he quoted himself as saying, "tell me what The Iliad and The Odyssey are." I started "hemming and hawing," Moore wrote. And then I said, according to Moore: "Well, they're . . . uh . . . you know . . . uh . . . okay, fine, you got me--I don't know what they're about. Happy now?" He'd smoked me out as a fraud, or maybe worse.  The only problem is none of this is true. It never happened. Moore is a liar. He made it up. It's a fabrication on two levels. One, I've never met Moore or even talked to him on the phone. And, two, I read both The Iliad and The Odyssey in my first year at the University of Virginia. Just for the record, I'd learned what they were about even before college. Like everyone else my age, I got my classical education from the big screen. I saw the Iliad movie called Helen of Troy and while I forget the name of the Odyssey film, I think it starred Kirk Douglas as Odysseus.

      From the  urlLink Telegraph  (Hat Tip:  urlLink Little Green Football )   One thing that unites the men who beheaded the American Nick Berg in Iraq, the soldiers who abused Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib, the Palestinians who have held on to Israeli body parts in Gaza City and the murderers of Daniel Pearl in Pakistan is that they all enjoyed what they did, and enjoyed it immensely.   There is almost no greater pleasure known to man than to commit great acts of cruelty in the belief that the cause of right and justice is being served. Anyone who has observed rioters will know that they are having a wonderful time: could there be a greater joy than vandalism with a social purpose?  I used to wonder how it was possible for ordinary men to commit evil acts, and to do so en masse. I was thinking of Nazi Germany at the time, but I might just as well have been thinking of the Soviet Union. More recently, we have the example of Rwanda, where perfectly ordinary people who had been living in apparent conditions of friendship with their neighbours suddenly turned on them and hacked them to death with machetes.  There are a few exceptional human beings who seem to delight in evil all their lives. It is as if there is some inherent or acquired defect in their brains that renders them unable to learn the decencies of life or conform themselves to the canons of civilised behaviour.   From the earliest age, they stand out by their capricious and cruel wilfulness. They delight in torturing animals, dousing them in kerosene and setting them alight, or putting them in the washing machine; they lie and cheat for preference, even when there is no advantage in doing so. They are indifferent to the opinions and sufferings of others, and never learn to modify their behaviour from their own experience.  They are what the 19th-century alienist J. C. Prichard called "morally insane'': they are neither deluded nor hallucinated - they may even be of good intelligence - but they are incapable of internalising a moral code and of conforming their conduct to it.

      So I have Civil Procedure exam today. It's a hard course, dreaded by all who are in law school. But in my cases its hard to the point of insanity. The professor provided us with some of his old exams and a model answer to those essays. Now bear in mind that our essay exam is 90 minutes long, want to know how long the model answer was? 19 TYPED pages. Yep, check it out  urlLink here  and pray and fast that I survive this exam.

      From  urlLink Andrew Sullivan    "The hero was distinguished by his achievement; the celebrity by his image or trademark. The hero created himself; the celebrity is created by the media. The hero was a big man; the celebrity is a big name. Celebrity-worship and hero-worship should not be confused. Yet we confuse them every day, and by doing so we come dangerously close to depriving ourselves of all real models. We lose sight of the men and women who do not simply seem great because they are famous but are famous because they are great. We come closer and closer to degrading all fame into notoriety... The celebrity is a person who is known for his well-knownness... In our world of big names our true heroes tend to be anonymous. In this life of illusion and quasi-illusion, the person of solid virtues who can be admired for something more substantial than his well-knownness often proves to be the unsung hero: the teacher, the nurse, the mother, the honest cop, the hard worker at lonely, underpaid, unglamorous, unpublicized jobs."  Daniel Boorstin, from 'The Image.'

      I really could not take studying anymore. I am drained and really can not focus, not that I studied much. I just realized that this has been a hectic semester, had major job search going on and some other personal stuff. I should not have taken 5 finals  and  a paper, but oh well. I do not think I will fail, except perhaps Civil Procedure, but we will see.  So in the midst of my boredom, I did some work on the blog. It wasn't difficult or anything, but it made me happy! There is a comment section now, so pound away your thoughts. Hope you also like the new look.  And now to go back to Professional Responisiblity, or why should lawyers be ethical (a virtual course not grounded in reality).

      From the  urlLink Guardian :   Encouraging schoolchildren to experiment with oral sex could prove the most effective way of curbing teenage pregnancy rates, a government study has found.  Pupils under 16 who were taught to consider other forms of 'intimacy' such as oral sex were significantly less likely to engage in full intercourse, it was revealed.   Britain's teenage pregnancy rate is the highest in Europe. In 2002 there were 39,286 teen pregnancies recorded. The government has spent more than £60 million to tackle the problem but so far failed to halt the rise.   A sex education course developed by Exeter University trains teachers to talk to teenagers about 'stopping points' before full sex.   Now an unpublished government-backed report reveals that a trial of the course has been a success. Schoolchildren, particularly girls, who received such training developed a 'more mature' response to sex.   The study by the National Foundation for Educational Research found youngsters were 'less likely to be sexually active' than peers who received traditional forms of sex education, dispelling the fears of family campaigners who believe such methods actually arouse the sexual interest of teenagers.   Now the government will recommend the scheme, called A Pause, to schools throughout England and Wales following the success of the trial in 104 schools where sexual intercourse among 16-year-olds fell by up to 20 per cent, according to Dr John Tripp of the Department of Child Health at the University of Exeter, who helped to design the course.   Teachers who sign up to the course are primed to deal with queries from pupils on all kinds of sexual experience. Those behind the course stress the scheme does not suggest teenagers experiment with oral sex. Instead they say A Pause promotes the message that other forms of physical intimacy are safer than full intercourse.   'It teaches people assertiveness skills and that they should be only as intimate as they feel comfortable with,' said Tripp.   A Department for Education and Skills spokesman said the report's verdict would be made available to all schools. 'All teachers respect peer-reviewed material, and this will help influence their decision,' he said.   Don't these people think that teens always like to go for "more"? Doesn't sexual "intimacy" escalate?

      From the NY  urlLink Times :   LOS ANGELES, May 9 — Tired from her shift at a strip club and in need of a heroin fix, Sharon Mitchell was about to turn the key in her front door on a March night in 1996 when a man sprang from the darkness and grabbed her by the throat.  Pushing her inside, he crushed her larynx, sank his teeth into her cheek, broke her nose and raped her. Choking on her blood, she managed to knock him out with a 10-pound dumbbell. It was then that she recognized him as the man who, obsessed with her pornographic movies, had heckled her earlier at the strip club.   So would you give up a life porn? Clean up and have nothing to do with an industry that brings on such scums? NO!   She got off drugs, kept her clothes on and went back to school for a doctorate in human sexuality. Then, 22 months after the attack, she founded the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation, which every month tests about 1,200 sex-video performers for sexually transmitted diseases.   ABSURD, I say!

       urlLink Thomas Hibbs  has a great piece analyzing "Friends" and "Sienfeld". Here is a money quote:   Going into the final episode, the big unresolved issue was whether Rachel and her baby would leave for Paris or remain in New York and thus continue the hope of a reunion with Ross, the child's father. It is instructive that amid all of Rachel's "should I stay or should I go?" deliberations and Ross's conniving to keep her from going, the baby is barely even mentioned. After they sleep together on the eve of her departure, the question is: "What did it mean?" For Rachel, it was the perfect way to say goodbye, but Ross sees it as a sign of a reunion that ought to be. Still, no mention of the baby. The audience is too busy oohing and aahing over Chandler and Monica's newly adopted twins to notice the absence of the other child or the way the child never figures in their declarations of love for one another.    Hey, I somehow got it right, look at the post below about my intial reaction to Friends.

      For some funny thoughts check Jeremy's  urlLink here .  I actually watched the last half and I am planning to post about it more next week. But one thought stuck in my mind, and that has to do with Rachel and Ross hooking up. I thought that was simply ridiculous because of the amount of ups and downs they went through. I really hate the notion that this supposed notion of romance can erase the intentional hurt that we suffer in relationships. I mean look at this way, Ross and Rachel both cheated on each other, both played with each other hearts, both used each other for sex and both brought a child to the world with no desire to be committed to each other or the child they got. So you tell me that after all those heartbreak and emotional roller coaster, they end up together? Absurd I say! Now, I know that this is a TV show but trust me this scanrio occurrs in real life too. We become careless with our hearts and rest all on the notion that "fate" will decide who we will end with. But take it from the expirenced, REPEATED heart breaks do not end in love but end up in people hurt and either hating the other person or taking their pain and frustration on their new love. Just an intial thought about "Friends", expect some more....

       urlLink Instapundit  makes this strong case for staying in Iraq:  First, we needed to make the point . . . It's dangerous to be on our bad side, even if you're a powerful dicatator with a large army and lots of bribed foreigners. That point has been made.  Second, we couldn't have a powerful, rich dictator with WMD programs and terrorist connections, who hated us, operating in the region without facing serious handicaps in our efforts elsewhere. That's taken care of, too.  Third, invading Iraq let us credibly extend that threat to other terror-supporting nations like Syria, Iran and, to some degree, Saudi Arabia. There's no question that they feel threatened -- in fact, it seems likely that they're sending fighters into Iraq as a way of mounting a "spoiling attack" intended to make us less likely to move against them. And we appear to be returning the favor in a lower-profile way. (And, on a more overt level, the Bush Administration is putting sanctions pressure on Syria.)  Fourth, over the longer term, we felt that a de-Saddamized Iraq provided an opportunity to produce an Arab state that would be neither a theocracy nor an autocracy, but a democratic model that would undercut Arab dictatorships (a root cause of terror, you know!) and terrorists themselves throughout the region. The dictators and terrorists certainly seem worried about that, as evidenced by their efforts -- and the efforts of their propaganda arm, Al Jazeera -- to undercut that project. urlLink

      Sorry for the slow posting, its finals week in the Bushra land and as you know that means utter devotion to those pesky, supposed appartus to measure one's knowledge.  But I want to thank you for the visits during April, the site had over 600 hits which is double the visits of March. Thank you.  Expect some major changes in the site in the upcoming weeks. For one, I am planning to move the blog to my own domain (URL address) which will allow me to post pictures and articles etc. I am also planning a series of weekly essays exploring the Christian faith. The reason for doing so is two-fold. First off, I really wanted to write and think about what constitutes my faith and why is it important to me. Second, I wanted to give the readers a concise understanding of what the Christian faith is all about. Of course I lack the scholarly poweress to do such task so I am relying on three books in particular. The first is Philip Yancey's  urlLink Reaching the Invisible God , the second is C.S. Lewis  urlLink Screwtape Letters  and finally John Piper's  urlLink Future Grace  urlLink  .  I am also considering asking my friend Roberto to be a guest blogger on the blog. Roberto has been an amazing asset during my law school years and I have learned many great things from him. I hope he accepts the offer.   Please keep me in your prayers during finals. I will be done on the 13th and will not start work till June 1st. If you need any help with your school work, please do not hesitate to contact me. Till the freedom of nil finals expect light posting. Adios...

      Today was the first full day at work. I enjoyed it very much. The only drawback is that I deal with alot of divorces and honestly that breaks my heart. The client that I was helping today in filing her divorce papers has been married for 10 years and after finishing up her paper work, she looks up to me and says " So after 10 years, that's it, huh?" That honestly made me feel crappy about this process.   Which leads me to some questions I have asking myself. As many of you know, I am somone who despises divorce but here I am helping clients who are filing for it. I realize that I have an obligation towards my clients to represent them the best way possible but how about my convictions, how do the come to play here? Then there is the issue of whether divorce is good or not, many of the clients that I see are getting a divorce because they have been abused or have been cheated on, does that justify divorce? If it does, then what else justifies divorce? Where should we draw the line? Should the interest of the child trump that of the woman?  Finally on a funny note, we were asked to stay in our offices today because the sheriffs were out in the courthouse with guns drawn. Apparently when a bus full of inmates came into the courthouse, it got stuck in a gate and the inmates had to step of the bus or suffer heat strokes! And from what I hear these things happen at this courthouse often...

      My Good friend Lolo had the following response to what I shared with Athar:   Both of your perspectives make sense and I think it is really interesting that you differentiated between God ALLOWING something to occur and him WANTING it to happen (hani). I think that goes hand in hand with Job's life. He was doing nothing wrong and disaster still came upon him. I think in this situation God wanted and allowed this to happen to Job. In the end, God did not want to "punish" or "fix" job up; he just wanted to take him deeper. And i think (if im understanding this right) that's where hani's point comes in. Because God has our future in mind, he wants certain things to occur so we could either reach a certian level or for whatever reason. However, I think (and this is just my opinion) that in athar's situation, it could have been both a matter of "want and allow". I say this because God could have been allowing it to happen since there wasn't "full surrender"(or whatever you want call it) and he also could have been allowing it so that it could benefit Athar in the future.   I think that this is a clear summary of what I was thinking (yep, Lolo is also a budding philosophy major) but I want to emphasize the main point I was making: Bad things do not always happen inspite of God's will and pleasure but many times they occur because of his will and pleasure.

      A1C is a test that measures your average blood sugar for the preceding three months. I just got my result back for that test and they were 6.1%! Which basically means that I am normal with no diabetes (I am not cured yet, but soon maybe)! The good thing about this result is that I have stopped taking regular insulin for the last month and half, so its all diet and excercise baby! I want to give three big shout outs: Bassem and Happy for encouraging me to hit the gym every day and then Mikey for taking me to the gym for the first time of my life last October. You guys rock, I am so happy! If you want to find more info about A1C cruise on  urlLink here .

      For while now, I have been struggling with the some of my political beliefs and how they do not fit the mold of one political philosophy. That is why I was pleased with a great article in the LA Times that spoke of the rise “purple” nation. Purple nation is people who do not fit the mold of blue or red states (this is the media’s way of distinguishing between conservatives and liberals.) Here is the money quote from the article:   Purple America demands independent creativity grounded in a solid moral core, as well as an inevitably thick skin; its inhabitants are attacked for godless "hedonism" on one side and politically incorrect "insensitivity" on the other. If I had a nickel for every time an urbane acquaintance marveled at how someone so "nice" could sympathize with those ghastly Republicans, I'd be able to build that bridge to the 21st century. Conversely, a cobblestone for every time a good ol' boy sneered at my choice of drink (wine or imported beer), car (Japanese sedan or German sports car) or clothing (mostly Italian, except my seersuckers) would lead me to that shining city on a hill. Purple America gets a tear in its eye during the Fourth of July parades of patriotism, but it relishes even more the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" on the Champs-Elysees after Lance Armstrong wins another Tour de France.    Check it out  urlLink here  in the LA Times site (if you have subscription) or read it  urlLink here  at my mirror site.

      Well, it is back to the blogging world. I miss doing this and its time to do some time management and allot time for this. Work and school have been consuming me, but now it is back to the blogging world.   Speaking of work, I am enjoying it very much. It is the most fulfilling thing that I have done for awhile. I enjoy helping litigants that come to us because we are simply the last resort for them. And the shinning light in what I do is that the law is mostly used as a tool that does rectify wrongs. Almost every litigant that comes is someone that has a heartbreaking story. It is an honor for me to help correct something that went wrong.   But as usual the law is very limited and honestly not setup to promote the cause of the poor. The law seems to be structurally problematic because the poor have no means of accessing it properly. For instance, I help prepare some housing cases that deal with evictions. Usually the landlord is represented by an attorney and the tenants are “pro per” or going at it commando style i.e. alone. Now take a guess who impresses the judges more? Who do you think makes the strongest arguments? Finally, who do you think the judge is afraid from?  Yes, judges get scared. Judges get scared because they know that their cases could be taken to a higher court and overturned. So the judge is someone that takes into account which party is more effective in making and sustaining legal arguments. Judges do take into account who is standing before them, especially if it is someone that is a player within the system.  You see the main thing that you must keep in mind is that the legal system is a  system .  A system that has repeat players, i.e. it is a place where the people who access quite often get to understand it more and get to be more familiar. The best example I can think of right now is my gym membership, one I first started going I had to bring my barcode card to get into the gym. The more I went to the gym, the more I was known by those who work there and that meant that now I never take my membership card. I am amused at the thought that I could keep on going without renewing my membership ever again. This is a system where repeat players get to have a pass every now then. The legal system has repeat players (attorneys and judges) that every now then give each other wink wink and the pat on the shoulder. This is the dilemma with the legal system, how to maintain a “system” and at the same time somehow limit the benefits that come with familiarity.  More on this later.

      My Internship this summer is coming to an end, and I was asked by one of my supervisors to write something that highlights my work this summer, so here goes:    Having trekked with my family through 5 different countries and then immigrating to the United States, the value of having a “home” is real to me. This is why working with litigants in answering Unlawful Detainer actions at the self-help center was special. Two litigants come to mind, the husband was a tad over 80 years old and his wife was only 72 years young. They both came to the center because they failed to pay the $1200+ rent for their two bedroom hole and they were getting evicted. Well, they came back again yesterday; they lost their case and with it, lost their home. The wife was distraught and realizing that the Sheriff is about to lock them out felt helpless. I also felt helpless, a feeling that I do not like much; all that I could do was refer them to Eviction Defense Network. As the wife was hurriedly leaving to make it there before closing time, the husband slowed down, turned around, shook my hands and thanked me for all what I did. Now, the million dollar question is: of what value was my help when in the end they lost their home? That question bothered me during my commute home. Was what I did valuable at all? Did they win? Did it change something that was terribly wrong? The honest answer to these pressing questions was a resounding no. But just then, I realized that I was thinking of this the wrong way. I was thinking of it in the context of who won in the courtroom, but in reality the correct context to think of this question is beyond the walls of the courtroom. What these litigants wanted was someone to listen, someone to care and help and someone who would say, “there is hope, you are not alone.” What I needed to hear was that injustice still exists and it is brutal, that the poor are alone and left to fend for themselves, and that as a future lawyer I can help to change that.Yes, the litigants lost their case and they might even lose the appeal. And for me life will go on with a watchful eye on this unjust world. But there was something unusual about this encounter: hope was given and a calling was issued and reaffirmed.
