       Spent $140 at Catnips and Carrots vet on my rabbit, Bouncy.&nbsp; She was in&nbsp;for a nasal lacrimal duct blockage this time...The past three times she went in for some dental.&nbsp; My fiance and I spent so much on her care, but it's worth it.&nbsp; Bouncy is like a daughter to us.&nbsp; Hopefully she'll live a long life.    &nbsp;  Tomorrow I will be going to Country Mazda to have some warranty work done on my car.&nbsp; Basically the rear bushing broke and the muffler has two 1 inch cracks on the tip.&nbsp; Hopefully they don't try to deny it.&nbsp; If they do, I will give them so much trouble that they'll think twice about denying me again.&nbsp; I may use a law called "Holder in due course."&nbsp; Basically, I will need to notify my bank, Mazda, to let them know that I will be applying this law until they honor their warranty.&nbsp; Under this law, I will deposit my monthly payments on a separate checking account until the problem is fixed.&nbsp; So basically Mazda won't get any of their money until the problem is fixed.&nbsp; I'm sure the dealership will be in a lot of trouble if I do use this law.

       Never heard of a blog until two weeks ago when I happened to come across one.&nbsp; I thought I would start one on my one just to get my feelings out.&nbsp; Since it's summer now and school restarts on Aug-16, I have some time to rest now.&nbsp; I was supposed to be studying for the boards now but I guess I just can't get myself motivated to do so.&nbsp; After all the step one is given in June and I still have a year.     &nbsp;   These days, I've been having some car trouble.&nbsp; My 2003.5 Mazdaspeed Protege (laser blue) is having a few problems and as usual the service departments that I've been to are bastards about upholding warranty work.&nbsp; What's the point of having a warranty when it just gets denied because it doesn't affect the drivability of the car.&nbsp; The last time I went to the dealership, they only changed ONE of the rear suspension bushings...That's like changing one of your bad tires.&nbsp; So about 4 days ago, my car has been serverly clunking and my steering has been at best vague.&nbsp; Here's what my bushing looks like  urlLink now &nbsp;(right click-open in new window).    &nbsp;   As most of my friend noticed, I'm pretty picky when it comes to my car.&nbsp; I just can't seem to be satisfied with dealerships.&nbsp; They are always so troublesome to go to and it feels like going to a Jiffy lube or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; Great Neck Mazda were really careless with their workmenship the last time my intercooler pipe came loose on the road.&nbsp; The car came back to me with a paint chip on the door, intake cover off, and missing engine cover.&nbsp; I was never given an apology by anyone at the dealership and was in fact labeled as a bad customer because I complaint to the General Manager after I had informed the Service Manager about my problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I was told&nbsp;by the SM that they (we) "don't want trouble customers like you here."     &nbsp;   Today, I spent the whole day at home with my fiance (which is rare).&nbsp; She complaints that I can't stay home and treats money like water.&nbsp; It's true, those two are my major character flaws.&nbsp; It's hard for me to stay home because it's boring and money is hard to save because I'm idiot.&nbsp; I'm trying to save, but it's just so hard to do so.&nbsp; Money is just so hard to keep around.&nbsp; I guess I gotta work in a field that pays a lot or I'll be in trouble...Maybe nephrology or surgery...
