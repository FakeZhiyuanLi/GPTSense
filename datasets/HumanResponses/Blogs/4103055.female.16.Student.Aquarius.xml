      Well, I'm feeling  mixed  today, mostly   good   though. I'm trying not to let to bad come through me. Hehe, tonight was funny. Went to Ian's at 7Pm, Nikki was there, then mazzy,kate and Jonathon came over and we all had a laugh. We watched school of rock and sung along to disney sing-a-long aladdin one lol. Was excellent. We pigged out on chinese and Cake teehee :P My diets blown..Meh...Damn tasty foods. Anyway, I'm getting paranoid because everyones asking if me and xan are okay... :S Why shouldnt we be, unless i'm missing something? As soon as I came back from Ian's , Kira was online and the first thing she said to me was 'Are you still going out with xan?'....I got all paranoid and panicked..I dunno what's going on anymore...Anywho lol. I've sliced my foot muscled to pieces, so i've totally knackered my foot and I've got a massive hole in my head with a scab over it...is yukky, so I have to cover it up with makeup  Anywayz, I'm off... Ciao Ciabatta bread!...Gaw, where did that come from?! Sadie x.x.x.  [p.s, working on a website right now, so that's why i cant be bothered with the colourful writing...]

Wasted journey's  , time spent better   knowing nothing   and looks, they don't help.Prying eyes wander west to where   oceans   meet    gold   , and you wonder   why my heart, it breaks in two .  Hours   pass   into   minutes  ,    kissing the seconds away   , and days seem to   melt   just like your classic   summers  . It's come to the point where,    everything looses perspective   ... and i'm the one, and   i'm the one  who ... Prying   eyes wander west   to where   oceans   meet    gold   , and you wonder   why my heart, it breaks for you  .   Stupid things are said  , stupid things are done and when the   time comes   i'll shout from    high mountain tops    ..

       Grr , I had   loads   of plans to do stuff today but   suprise suprise   I get    ill   . :( Man! I have really bad   stomach ache  , so that's making me feel like   shit  . I also    didn't sleep    well last night. I went to sleep at   2 o'clock  , and woke up at   6 o'clock  . I woke up during various times in the night and had 2   weird dreams  . One of my dreams was about   my boyfriend  , I can't remember what happened exactly but I think we'd not seem each other in ages and then we just   split up  . Possibly to do with the film I saw last night, called   'Down To You'   with Julia Stiles and Freddy Prince Junior in it. I really fancy   Julia Stiles   when she's in 'Down To You' and    '10 Things I hate about you '  . I think she's just really   pretty .  I have a   Science   question; "   If Homosapians are homo's, Is that why they're extinct   ?"-Joey,Friends. Sorry about that, Just watching it right now. Erm, so anyway, I    didn't    Go to Town to be support for   Melissa   when she got pierced, I    didn't    hand in my   CV  , I    didn't    go to   Adam's  . Damn It hurts :(   Stupid   Stomach.

To her only fate, seize the fate. I’ll stay strong.   Pre-chorus  I’m Waiting, I’ve waited so long for you.    Chorus   The Story’s dead and gone, You have to let it go. Have I lost you yet? Or will I when it’s all over.   Verse 2  You make it so hard to say goodbye, So I’ll just stay by your side. What makes me so special? Honoured to stay with you.    Pre-chorus   I’m Waiting, I’ve waited so long for you. I’m Waiting, I’ve waited so long for you.   Chorus  The Story’s dead and gone, You have to let it go. Have I lost you yet? Or will I when it’s all over. The Story’s dead and gone, You have to let it go. Have I lost you yet? Or will I when it’s all over.    Verse 3   You make me feel alive. Just one touch sends me to ecstacy. Hand in hand, we’ll walk together, Forever to be, just you and me.   Pre-chorus  I’m Waiting, I’ve waited so long for you

        W  h  o  o  , Well I've been talking To   Melissa   most of this afternoon until night, about 7 hours seriously about her getting her    Nipple Pierced    tommorow, and me being the   expert in piercings   she wants to know what happenes, safety procedures   etc    etc . She's   dead   nervous but I told her not to worry. I hope if tommorow goes well when I hand in my   C  V   to Primark and they ask me back for an Interview that i'll get a job there because then I can afford to within a month get my   Tragus  and  Industrial   ear piercings  . Whoo! Can't wait. I'm also thinking about getting my   nose pierced    again , had to take it out last time because Ian,   My Best Mate  , pulled it out by accident and   infected   it with bacteria from his hands. Boohoo :( I can't wait until I get my Tragus pierced though, I'm really    looking forward    to that. I really  want  a job too though, I think it would make my parents treat me more like a   grown-up   instead of a   k i d   if I did. They don't realise that's I'm    turning into a woman    already. Especially my '  Dad  '. Meh, he's just a big    fat arsehole    who I couldn't give two flying fucks about anymore with the way he   treats  me . It's going to be   great   in a few weeks aswell because i'll be   living on my own  whoo ! Even though my mum thinks i'll be  a  twat  , I honestly won't, I'll be really   mature   and probably    clean    the house because I know that no-one else will do it for me. That will make me mature quick :)  Yay!.  Anywho, I've written    two      songs tonight, I'll post them   after   this. They are basically different aspects of how I feel about certain people whether it's   how   I'm   feeling   now   or   how   I   used   to   feel   for   someone .                                                         Meow Meow Meep !                         xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx   Sadie   xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx

      Wow, Finally a blinkin' diary site that works! Teenopendiary.com has changed and is crappy and always going down [not in the good sense!] and diaryland.com is just poo. Adam kindly told me about this site, Cheers Adam, and then told me it was a joke. I'm rather confused but hey. I'm so bored today, I went to bed at 1:30 and got up at 8:30. Not good aye?..Yeah, well I have things on my mind, that's probably why. Anywho, I'm gonna just go now to watch 'Fresh Prince Of Bel Air' double bill yay! See Ya, Sadie xXx
