      Well, this is it for me for a while. Alverice and I are going on a week long vacation with my family. Every year they rent a house or two on the Outer Banks. My grandfather and my aunts, uncles and cousins all come and we spend one insane week together. I promise I will return with a plethora of amusing anecdotes about my dysfunctional family, and about how I look in a bathing suit.

      It's been  urlLink mentioned before , but I just can't stand the way people with infertility&nbsp;are&nbsp;portrayed&nbsp;by the media, especially those who choose to pursue ART (assisted reproductive technology).&nbsp;Unless they are celebrities like Courteney Cox Arquette or Brooke Shields, chances are they will be portrayed as&nbsp;psychopaths with ulterior motives.   For once, Hollywood is lined right up with the  urlLink religious fanatics  who believe IVF is a mortal sin and&nbsp;equate the process to a "sloppy high school science project" in which lives are casually discarded&nbsp;because the parents are too selfish to accept "the will of God" that they were "not meant to have children"&nbsp;( real quotes  from Human Life International's website.)&nbsp;In&nbsp;a different situation, these statements would be seen as ludicrous: "Oh,&nbsp;you have cancer? Well, sorry, looks like it's not the will of God for you to live.&nbsp;What?&nbsp;You want treatment?&nbsp;Oh no, that would be selfish! Why don't you go pray for a while and let us know how it works out. If it's God's plan for you to live, you will live."&nbsp;No one in their right mind would actually say this to someone with cancer. But when it comes to infertility there is an astonishing&nbsp;lack of compassion for those unlucky enough to have to deal with it.   You don't have to watch much primetime TV to get a glimpse of some of the outrageous views that are out there. Just the other night I was watching  Law and Order: Criminal Intent , an episode entitled "Ill-Bred." (I know, already you can see where this is going.) The episode is set on a horse farm where there have been some mysterious activities going on. The detectives suspect that the female owner of the farm is using the horses to smuggle&nbsp;cocaine&nbsp;into the U.S.&nbsp;from overseas. When the truth comes out, they discover that in fact, the smuggling was orchestrated by Paige, a stable worker. In addition to running her own little drug cartel using equine uteruses as transport (proving right off the bat that she's a sicko), Paige had also manipulated her husband into having an affair with the married stable owner and made sure that a pregnancy would result by slipping fertility drugs into her husband's chewing tobacco and poking pinholes in his condoms. Her plan was to blackmail the rich owner and&nbsp;then buy her own horse farm, leaving her unsuspecting husband in the dust. Her plan works, until the detectives show up.   Now, what frustrates me is that most people won't realize how ridiculous the entire premise of the story is. Most people have no reason to understand how fertility works; it's not something they ever need to think about. As my sister Keegan remarked the other day, "You don't care how electricity works until your lights go out." Unfortunately, my lights have gone out and so I've done a lot of research and consequently I&nbsp;know way more about infertility than the average OB/Gyn. (I'm only exaggerating a little.)   There are multiple problems with the story, but here are the most glaring.   1) Paige secretly gives her husband the fertility drug gonadotropin in his chewing tobacco.  -Gonadotropin cannot be administered orally; it can only be given by injection. I am going to be taking this drug soon, and believe me, if there were any way to take it orally I would know about it!   2) The gonadotropin makes him produce extraordinarily large amounts of sperm, guaranteeing that he will impregnate Paige's boss.  -Gonadotropin is regularly used in women to stimulate ovulation. It is rarely used in men, and when it is, it is only for existing problems like an extremely low sperm count. It will not produce "super sperm" in men who are already producing sperm normally. And among men who do have sperm problems, gonadotropin only succeeds in increasing sperm for about 15% of them.   3) While questioning the husband, Detective D'Onofrio tells him he's been taking fertility drugs. "That's impossible," he says. Detective D slyly asks, "Have you felt an extra 'spring in your step' lately?" "Yeah," the husband counters, "what of it?" Detective D: "Thank you, fertility drugs."  -This one annoys me most of all because it perpetuates the myth that sperm production is related to libido and sexual prowess. In reality there is no connection. You can't tell how many sperm you're producing by how sexually charged you feel. Fertility has nothing to do with libido. And fertility drugs are not a more expensive alternative to Viagra. In fact, they often have the opposite effect and cause the patient to lose all interest in sex because of the hormonal roller coaster his or her body is subjected to in the course of treatment.   So, to sum up, real life&nbsp;people who use fertility drugs are not all crazy, manipulative and&nbsp;greedy. And  Law and Order 's writers need to do better research before writing their scripts. Thank you, and good night.

      I remember the first time I went on the pill, just before getting married, and how awful and pukey&nbsp;I felt for the first few weeks. So after two days of ingesting my little pink friends, I was feeling&nbsp;rather proud of myself for feeling absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Until yesterday afternoon. At around 4:00 I felt a slight twinge in my forehead, which gradually developed into a full-blown, jackhammer-through-my-temples headache.  &nbsp; When bedtime came around my head was still pounding, so I decided to do a bit of yoga to get centered and relax it into submission. I was about 10 minutes into my practice doing a forward bend (and I must say, a pretty&nbsp;good one too,&nbsp;with my chest flat against my legs and my head gently stretching towards the floor)&nbsp;when all of a&nbsp;sudden I was wrenched out of my peaceful zen-like state by a spasm in my esophagus.&nbsp;Before I could&nbsp;utter a single "om," I was watching the contents of my dinner&nbsp;plummet towards&nbsp;my sticky mat.  &nbsp; Now, I know it's normal to feel nauseous while practicing yoga. But tossing my cookies in a completely inverted position was&nbsp;a brand new experience for me, and one I hope I don't repeat. After cleaning up I decided I'd had enough yoga for one night and crawled into bed with Alverice, who stroked my hair until I fell asleep like the amazing man that he is.  &nbsp; Today the headache is still hanging on. I think tonight I'll skip the yoga and go straight to bed.

      Yesterday was the official start of the IVF process, and what a start it was! I&nbsp;had&nbsp;an 8:30 a.m. appointment for&nbsp;my baseline sonogram and day three bloodwork. Since the clinic is about half an hour away, I set my alarm for 7:15, figuring that would give me plenty of time to get nice and pretty for Dr. Ambrosine. Alverice had volunteered to cover for a coworker and was at the office from 11:00 p.m. on Saturday until 6:00 a.m. I never sleep well when he's gone. It's not that I miss him - although I do - it's just that I am such a creature of habit that when something is different it throws me off. Couple that with the fact that Walker&nbsp;has a cold and kept sneezing directly into my face&nbsp;every 5 minutes or so, and that added up to a long night with no&nbsp;sleep.&nbsp;The last time I looked at the clock it was 4:30.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The next time I looked at it, it was 8:15. What the eff?!? As it turned out, Alverice had climbed into&nbsp;bed at 6:30, and when my alarm went off 45 minutes later he reached over and turned it off without even waking up. Knowing that if I didn't make it to my appointment&nbsp;we would have to postpone our IVF by an entire month, I was frantic. I threw on a t-shirt and jeans, stuffed my hair into a ponytail, ran out to my car and sped all the way to the RE's office, half-awake the entire way.  &nbsp;  When I got there at 8:50 I dashed into the waiting room and apologized profusely to the receptionist. She gave me a quizzical&nbsp;smile and said, "Well hello Chelsea ... what are you doing here so early? We have you down for 11:45. Didn't the scheduling nurse call you?"  &nbsp;  No, in fact, she had  not  called me. But that's OK, that's OK,&nbsp;the good news is I almost killed myself trying to get to an appointment for which I was three hours early!  &nbsp;  I waited for an hour, reading National Geographic through bleary eyes. Finally they called me back to get my vein punctured by a very grumpy phlebotomist. I couldn't blame her for being grumpy; who wants to be at work on a Sunday morning? And knowing that your day is going to consist entirely of sticking bitter,&nbsp;barren women with needles? I couldn't blame her one bit. After&nbsp;taking a nice&nbsp;little vial&nbsp;of my blood she directed me back to the examination room with the oh-so-friendly ultrasound machine and told me to strip.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For those of you not familiar with the&nbsp;fertility sonogram process, it is not at all like the ultrasound you get once you're pregnant, with the little curved&nbsp;transducer&nbsp;and the&nbsp;goopy lube on your belly. That is a much cuter process than this one. When the doctor is checking out your ovaries, she uses an internal wand. Here's a photo to tickle your imagination.   &nbsp; urlLink      The ultra-friendly ultrasound wand, AKA the "dildo cam".&nbsp;  urlLink     &nbsp;  Thanks to my insanely bad menstrual cramps, it wasn't such&nbsp;a fun time having that thing probing around inside of me. I mean, I'd take it over an HSG any day, but still. I distracted myself by pretending that Dr. Ambrosine was my fairy godmother, waving her wand at my ovaries and giving them&nbsp;magic powers.  &nbsp;  When the probing was over, she told me everything looked great and we were good to go for IVF #1. She gave me a prescription for birth control pills, which are used to suppress egg production so that when you start the stimulation drugs, it's like "BAM! Take that, you lazy ovaries!" and they respond&nbsp;by churning out dozens of eggs.&nbsp;I'll receive the details of my protocol in the mail sometime later this week. Basically, my treatment will go something like this:  &nbsp;  1)Birth control pills for 4 weeks for suppression  2)Lupron injections for 5 days  3)Gonal-F and Repronex injections&nbsp;for 8-12 days, depending on how I respond  4)Trigger shot  5)Egg retrieval  6)ICSI  7)Blastocyst transfer  8)Heparin treatment  9)Beta test  &nbsp;  So there it is - 9 easy steps to an IVF cycle. The one thing that makes me the most nervous (besides the fear that it won't work) is the fact that I have a slight needle phobia. Of those 9 steps, 7 involve needles. At one point in the cycle, I will be giving myself 6 injections in one day. Yikes. This is going to be interesting.

      Four years ago today, one of my best friends died. He was 23 years old,&nbsp;a victim of depression and alcoholism.  &nbsp;  I met&nbsp;him when I was 19, the summer after my freshman year of college. We instantly became friends, and after knowing each other for a few weeks we started dating. He was my first serious boyfriend, and it was with him that I learned all of those things you learn in your first adult relationship. We were decidedly amateurs when it came to communication, trust, and balancing time together and time apart. In a couple of months we went from planning our wedding to absolutely hating each other. I was convinced he was lying to me, and he was convinced I was lying to him. (We were both wrong.) After Christmas, I decided not to return to school for winter semester so I could have some space. On Valentine's Day we broke up.  &nbsp;  For over a year&nbsp;we had no contact. The next&nbsp;summer he came home, and because we attended the same church we inevitably ran into each other. After a few tentative and awkward conversations, we talked about what had gone wrong. We talked about our regrets, and we forgave each other for the hurt we had caused. We developed a friendship that was far more understanding and open than our&nbsp;romantic relationship had ever been. He called me for advice about his new girlfriend, we played our guitars together, he taught me how to make pesto. When I decided to go on a mission to France, he was my biggest supporter, and one of the last friends I hugged good-bye.  &nbsp;  There's a lot I don't know about what happened in the next several months. I was working hard&nbsp;and going through some enormous challenges on my mission.&nbsp;He and his parents wrote me encouraging letters, and I assumed everything was fine and that he would be around when I got home.  &nbsp;  It wasn't. And he wasn't.  &nbsp;  In the four years that have passed, I've learned a lot. I've&nbsp;learned to forgive myself for being so caught up in my own life. For&nbsp;being unaware of&nbsp;the absolute hell he must&nbsp;have been living in.&nbsp;For being powerless to help in any way that mattered. I'm grateful for the time we spent together before I left for France and that I got a chance&nbsp;to say the things I said. Not everyone gets that chance.  &nbsp;  Most of all, I'm grateful for the peace I have found in my life. I am so blessed with a wonderful husband who is the best friend I could ever ask&nbsp;for, and who makes my&nbsp;life more spectacularly happy&nbsp;than I had ever imagined it would be. I strongly believe that we go on after death, and so I like to think that somehow, my old friend is looking down on me and wishing me well.&nbsp;   So today, on&nbsp;the anniversary of a terrible event, I remember&nbsp;all that he taught me, and I thank him.

      My husband Alverice* came home from work today and found me lying on our bed in a fetal position, moaning and cursing the day I was born. Naturally, he thought I was dying. Then he saw the heating pad and the bottle of oxycodone and realized that I was just having period-induced cramps.  &nbsp;  Three weeks ago I had a laparoscopy to investigate my innards, specifically the innards that are related to producing babies. My RE (Reproductve Endocrinologist, AKA Really Expensive fertility doctor)&nbsp;found endometriosis on my ovary, bowel, and the back of my uterus - in endometriosis land, what they call the cul-de-sac. Because of the torture I endure every month, I was not surprised with my diagnosis. In a way it helps to know what's causing the pain and to know that I am not a hypochondriac. There's a cause for what I feel. So I'm glad I have some sort of explanation.  &nbsp;  Dr. Ambrosine* removed all the endo she could, using a laser (or possibly a light sabre), and also scraped some polyps out of my poor battered uterus. She warned me that my next period would be a doozy. She wasn't lying.  &nbsp;  I've never been more grateful for percocet.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  *all names in my blog have been changed (using the  urlLink Mormon Name Generator ) to protect the innocent. Plus it's way more fun that way.

      Since graduating from college last year, one of the greatest pleasures I have discovered is reading. That may sound odd, considering that I was an English major and did nothing but read (and write about what I read) for a good four years. The difference is, now I can read whatever I want to, and I can do it at my own pace. I've re-read a lot of the books I had read hurriedly for classes and discovered new ideas I missed the first time. I've re-read the entire works of Orson Scott Card and was reminded of why I fell in love with his writing at the age of 13. Yesterday on my way to take a bath (ah, the luxury of my life!) I picked up my copy of  The Red Tent  by Anita Diamant. I enjoyed it the first time I read it several years ago, and this time it took hold of me so completely that I didn't even notice the bath water growing cold around me until my cat jumped up onto the side of the tub and peered down at me like I was crazy.   The Red Tent  is a fictional retelling of Genesis 34, the story of Dinah the daughter of Jacob. Following the Jewish tradition of midrash, Diamant makes Dinah the narrator of her own story. In a simple but poetic voice, Dinah recounts the history of her family. Some aspects are familiar - the jealousy between Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wrestling with the angel, the sons of Jacob slaughtering the men of Shechem.  The difference is Dinah's voice. She speaks to the reader as if to a friend sitting in the same room. "We have been lost to each other for so long," she says in the prologue. "My name means nothing to you. My memory is dust. This is not your fault, or mine. The chain connecting mother to daughter was broken and the word passed to the keeping of men, who had no way of knowing." The heart of her story is in the traditions of her mothers, Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah. She tells about the work of their daily life: gardening, tending animals, cooking, spinning wool, carrying water, making beer. At a young age she becomes a midwife and learns how to use herbs, incantations, and birthing bricks to help mothers deliver their babies.  She also describes the religious traditions of the women, which were completely separate from those of the men. Long before the revelation of the ten commandments and the injunction to "have no other gods before me," Diamant speculates that the women likely worshipped a pantheon of goddesses. Some of those mentioned are Gula, goddess of healing, Taweret, goddess of maternity and childbirth, and Innana, the Great Mother and the Queen of Heaven.  The center of the women's spiritual lives is the red tent, the place where they gather together to separate themselves from the men while menstruating or giving birth. Far from being a punishment for impurity, this was a time of rejoicing and celebrating life; as Leah puts it, "In the red tent, the truth is known. In the red tent, where days pass like a gentle stream, as the gift of Innana courses through us, cleansing the body of the last month's death, preparing the body to receive the new month's life, women give thanks -- for repose and restoration, for the knowledge that life comes from between our legs, and that life costs blood."  The women's lives revolve around fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth. The first time I read the story, I was fascinated by this at an intellectual level. Diamant provides many details about the herbs the women used for contraception, the prayers they uttered to induce labor, and the lengths they went to in order to achieve pregnancy. I guess it shouldn't have surprised me that this time, my interest was much more personal. I cried as I read the story of Rachel, who was infertile for many years before finally conceiving. "Rachel could not smile at her sister while her own body remained fruitless. She was often away from the family's tents, seeking the counsel of Inna, who had a seemingly endless list of concoctions and strategies to open her womb. Rachel tried every remedy, every potion, every rumored cure. She wore only red and yellow -- the colors of life's blood and the talisman for healthy menstruation. She slept with her belly against trees said to be sacred to local goddesses. Whenever she saw running water, she lay down in it, hoping for the life of the river to inspire life within her ... But all these things did nothing for Rachel's womb."  I relate to her feelings of desperation, to her willingness to try anything. That's the same thing I feel as I give myself shots each day and go to seeminlgy endless doctors appointments. And I count myself lucky that I was born in a time when effective treatments are available to me.  But there is something they had then that is missing now. Inside the red tent, the women care for one another and remind each other of the miracle of their bodies. While giving birth, the woman in labor is held up on three sides by her sisters while a midwife catches the baby. After the baby is born, they all care for the newborn and the mother until she is well enough to resume her normal life. The world we live in now is very different. Fertility treatments are not discussed openly, and are often kept a secret. Women give birth in hospitals with a husband and often no other women in the room. When she goes home with a new baby, she does it alone, unless she is lucky enough to have a mother who lives near by who can help. We live our lives largely separate from the support of other women. And at this particular time in my life, I grieve that loss.  Dinah speaks from the past, reminding us of the stories that are missing and urging us to remember them. "And now you come to me -- women with hands and feet soft as a queen's, with more cooking pots than you need, so safe in childbed and so free with your tongues. You come hungry for the story that was lost. You crave words to fill the great silence that swallowed me, my mothers, and my grandmothers before them...It is terrible how much has been forgotten, which is why, I suppose, remembering seems a holy thing." At the end of the book, Dinah leaves us with a promise that if we remember her story we won't be alone. "Blessings on your eyes and on your children. Blessings on the ground beneath you. Wherever you walk, I go with you."

      I've been taking Lupron for seven days now. So far it's gone well. The worst side effect has been the headaches. They start every day at around 2 in the afternoon and grow steadily worse until I go to bed. I'm very lucky that I don't have to deal with stress from work or school. I can lie down whenever I need to, do yoga, cook, and just focus on getting through this cycle.  The part I was most worried about - actually giving myself the injections - in reality has been the easiest. The first time I did it I sat there with the syringe pointed at my belly for 10 minutes before I finally got up the courage to plunge it in. I did it - and all I could think was, "Is that it?" The Lupron needle is so tiny that I barely feel it going in. The medication itself does sting for a while afterwards, but it's nothing terrible and I feel much better now about the prospect of giving myself heparin injections for nine months if I am lucky enough to become pregnant.  Other than the headaches, the only thing I can complain about is the mood swings. And really, Alverice should be the one to complain about that. For a while he was puzzled every time I'd have an uncharacteristic outburst, but now he seems to be catching on to the fact that I'm going to be crazy as a loon for the next little while. He's been absolutely marvelous.  I have a tentative calendar for how this cycle will go. Come on and follow the bouncing fertility ball with me!   Phase One: Ovarian Suppression   August 4-13  Lupron 10 units daily; Dexamethasone .5 mg daily     Phase Two: Ovulation Induction   August 14-24  Gonal-F 2 vials daily, Repronex 1 vial daily; Lupron 5 units daily; Doxycycline 100 mg daily (Alverice will take this as well to prepare his sperm for ICSI); baby aspirin therapy I'll be closely monitored during ovulation induction with daily visits to the RE for blood draws and ultrasounds.     Phase Three: Egg retrieval   August 25  I'll be under general anesthesia (hallelujah!) while the doctor aspirates multiple eggs from my ovaries using a long needle. Begin progesterone-in-oil injections; begin heparin injections. Alverice will give a sample of his sperm the same day, and the lab fairies will combine a few of the good swimmers with a few of my eggs through ICSI (a procedure that has only existed for a few years in which a single sperm is injected with a needle directly into the egg. It is used in cases of severe male factor.)     Phase Four: Embryo Transfer   August 28-30  Depending on how well they develop, up to 3 embryos will be transferred into my uterus either 3 or 5 days after they are created in the lab. Continue progesterone-in-oil and heparin injections.   Phase Five: Beta Test   September ?  This is where we find out if it worked or not. If it did, I'll continue PIO and heparin shots; if not, we'll decide whether to go straight on to attempt #2 or take a break.  The really scary part is that anywhere along the way the whole thing could fall to pieces. I could be a poor responder and not produce enough eggs. I could produce  too  many eggs and develop OHSS (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome) which can be very dangerous and result in a cancelled cycle. Our embryos could fail to thrive in the lab. Or they could simply fail to implant after the transfer. As straightforward as the process seems to be, there is so much that could go wrong. Our chances of success are about as good as they possibly can be, but I'm doing my best to prepare myself for disappointment. I'm assuming we'll have to do this several times before succeeding. That way if it happens on the first try, I'll be pleasantly surprised.

      Today is the official start of IVF/ICSI cycle number one. Yesterday I had a hysteroscopy to follow up on the D&C I had during my lap in June. They removed several polyps, and before we begin the IVF process we had to make sure those hadn't resurrected themselves. My first hysteroscopy was last October, and it was a breeze. I actually enjoyed it because the nurse turned the TV screen so that I could see the images they captured of inside my uterus. This time...all I can say is  holy frijoles ! As soon as the hysteroscope was in I had cramping like I've never experienced before (and I have endometriosis!) I think my innards were still sore from the lap/D&C because every time Dr. Ambrosine moved the instrument it felt like she was stabbing me from the inside. Luckily the whole procedure was over in about 5 minutes.  Today I had my baseline ultrasound (date with Mr. Dildocam) to see if the birth control pills have suppressed my ovaries enough. They have, so Dr. Ambrosine gave me the green light to begin Lupron injections tonight. That is, assuming my meds arrive today. They were supposed to come yesterday but there was a mix-up in shipping at Freedom Drug. The last person I spoke to assured me that I would receive them between 8:00 and 3:00 today, but it's now after 2 and there's no FedEx guy in sight. So we'll see what happens. I'm more than a little nervous about injecting myself; I'm trying to be a grown-up about it and mostly succeeding by forcing myself to think about other things.  The most surreal part of today's appointment was making out the check to the fertility center. We're participating in their shared-risk program, in which they require you to pay the full amount for 6 cycles up front. I won't shock you by mentioning amounts, but let's just say it'll be a long, long time before I write a check that large again!

      Well, I promised to return with great tales of familial dysfunction, and I am as good as my word.  On our way to the Outer Banks we stopped off in Williamsburg to have a short visit with my grandmother. We have a cute nickname for her which all the grandkids use, but after this trip I think I’ll have to come up with a more descriptive name to call her. (Not to her face, of course.) Within minutes of being in her presence, she looked discerningly at Alverice and me and said, “Hmm, both of you have put on quite a bit of weight.” Now, after knowing her for 26 years I’ve come to expect her to be downright bitchy most of the time, but somehow it still shocks me when she says things like that. “Thanks for noticing,” was the best response I could come up with. A few minutes later when A and I had left the room my dad (who has been under a great deal of professional stress lately and is literally on the verge of a breakdown) took his mother aside and sternly told her she had been rude and demanded that she apologize to us. She refused, then asked my sister Keegan, “Were you raised to disrespect your elders?” A few minutes later we left, and our vacation was off to a joyful start.  The week at the beach was actually rather uneventful this year, which is a good thing. Because of my dad’s emotional state, my parents decided to rent their own house separate from the rest of the extended family. This turned out to be a great move; most of the drama usually involves one of my uncles saying something inflammatory and my dad freaking out about it. This year he could just go over to his own house when he started getting annoyed. Also, because everyone was aware he’s having a hard time, there was much less provocation than there has been in years past. My uncles are the kind of people who like to “stir the pot,” so to speak, and they don’t normally have the sense or the emotional maturity to know when to quit. So it was encouraging to see that they’ve learned how to keep quiet, if only for a few days at a time.  I think the best part was hanging out with my cousins. There are 12 of us, and we only see each other once or twice a year. I had a great time sitting in the hot tub late at night talking with Chalissa and Rehanna, who are 16 and 17 and both getting ready to apply to college. Every time I see them I’m shocked at how much they’ve grown, and impressed with the wonderful people they’re becoming.  Another fun part was that Paradise, my aunt by marriage to my uncle Benteen, brought her mother Audeanne along. It was nice to have a grandmotherly person there, especially since Audeanne is the exact opposite of my own grandmother in every way and is one of the sweetest women in the country.  On Thursday night at dinner all of us remarked that the week had gone exceptionally well. The weather was perfect, the water was warm, we ate amazing food every day, and we were all getting along. In retrospect, we really should have seen it coming. On Friday morning my uncle Arville and my dad had a run-in about what to do for dinner that night. I won't get into detail because frankly it's extremely silly and boring. Suffice it to say, words were exchanged. That evening we all went to see  The Village  (which I loved) and back at the house we all sat in the living room having a nice discussion about the film’s meaning. I wasn’t in the room when it happened, but apparently Arville said something that provoked my dad in just the right way and a nasty, nasty argument promptly ensued. It ended with my parents back at their own house and my uncle fuming at ours until late at night when he seemed to calm down a bit after sitting out on the deck by himself and coming back with an oddly grassy smell.  On Saturday morning they apologized and everything was OK again. Just in time for Alverice and me to head back home.  So to summarize, we had a good time, and we are now more tired, tan, and fat than we were when we left. Long live the family reunion.
