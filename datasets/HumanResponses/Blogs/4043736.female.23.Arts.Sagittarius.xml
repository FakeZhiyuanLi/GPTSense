       Hey.   I'm just chillin and illin' and GODZILLIN'  (John made that one up- Mad props to Johnston on dee eastside!)     ?     You know, if everybody visited one Common Blog, the whole gang could keep in touch in a nice way. We could all even have our own little individual rants. It would rock. ... .... ........ ...............     Man.             God.             Shit.....                 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^Washyourfaceandrivemetofarenzy^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^        Thats a Phish song for ya'll.  Heeheee....     OK. I have a new thing for Elvis. (Yes, i know...) I have never appreciated The Elvis much, but i dunno - I've got some downloaded - and i like it.   I recommend  You're the Devil in Disguise  or  suspicious Minds  Its all good. Old Elvis, young Elvis, i love it all. Is this wrong? Am i caught in a trap? I can't walk out? cause i love ya too much, baby? Yeah, and listen to this crazy shit: I'm into Studio 54 Disco music now. Download "Push Push in the Bush" common, and do it, do it. Its fricking hilarious. Do It! Download it!!!

       Its an early Downtown Fredericton morning. I can hear the buses wheezing around down near Kings Place... I'm sittin' here at Dana Banana's computer, playin' with the old bloggity blogington, and i discover a crappyfact; the only way you can customize zee Blog is to comprehend the madness that is HTML. Kindergarten kids are being taught this in schools for petes sake.   I used to try and hide it...I used to avoid situations where one might use HTML...I would even try to get other people to use it for me....I was ashamed. Now, the painful pain just got too painful to bare on my shoulders alone! (Oh, the PAIN!)   I'm seeing a councilor about it now, learning how to cope with my HTML illiteracy... The first step is admitting it. So here i am, exposing my bitter truth to my Blog, and to my Blog family. My name is Natalie Perry, and i am HTML illiterate.     .....For information on HTML illiteracy and HTML literacy programs, please call your local HTML Literacy Centre.

        As of Monday evening, Natalie Perry of Marysville, New Brunswick, discovered today how easy it is to create an online Blog. A  Blog, (Blogus Onlinius Maximus)     is an online forum type thing, and has changed Ms Perry's world view. "It 's so easy to make your own Blog!" Freaked Perry, "I think I'm gonna Freak !"         Something shadows her Blog inspired joy, however.   Perry is upset over a huge  Blob backlash, caused by her Blog use.  At a press conference today, Perry responded to the allegations of anti-Blob sentiments, " I love Blobs! ... I've often thought about becoming a Blob myself!"

       I was sitting at Second Cup today, sucking back a medium iced mocha, and i watch the people that pass by my window seat. I notice a lot of people smoking cigarettes. Businessmen, bus drivers, pregnant fourteen year olds and guys that look like Roadies but probably aren't...all hanging outside Kings Place draggin' on cigarettes. Every single one of these "smokers" have a confident heir about them...their heads up, hands posed and blowing smoke directly in the face of Cancer, heart disease and the surgeon general. Smoking is instant confidence; just by puffing away on one of these things, a person can stand alone in a crowd and not feel awkward, but the opposite. Smokers seem to feel "cool" when they're haulin' on a cigarette. I love smoking. I just can't afford it. Being cool is not in my budget. I think cigarettes taste like shit and are the worst possible thing you can do for your health too.  BUT  I'm telling you now, if you want to look on top of your game, pull out your pack, tap a long white peice of design genius, light it on fire, and you're a dragon; a solitary god. You're breathing fire now, and you're one tough son of a bitch. Having a smoke says " Look at me, breathing flames. I know its bad for me, but i don't give a fuck - I don't care. Smoke is coming out of my mother fucking mouth! Beat that, losers!!" You have to be making some money to afford them, so its a symbol of wealth too. Smokers band together; "hey, ya gatta light?" or "Can i get a smoke off ya man?" they take care of eachother. If you're a smoker, you are already a member of an international group. A stranger in a foreign land ? Start smoking. You'll meet lots of other people. Just keep a lot of cigs and a light on hand, and you got yourself instant friends. You also have instant enemies; non-smokers - but who needs those losers anyway?

             I received three letters today in the mail.          The first letter was from the the CIBC.  I applied for a student VisaCard on the third.  Since the envelope didn't contain a card, i guessed rejection, and i guessed right.  They were very polite about it though, like, "sorry, try again" I have no job, so, its really probably best.  I'll have to work on that credit rating...             The second letter was from the Student Financial Centre.  I feared the worst, but they were just informing me of my "status".  I'm on probation...they're gonna give me a loan, but if i ever decide to fuck up again they're gonna destroy me.  Fair enough.  I could give them some medical excuses that would take me off this "black list", and i probably will, just for my own protection.               The third letter was from the University of New Brunswick. "Oh god, this can't be good" i thought as i ripped the puppy open.   I scanned it...nothing negative....then i come to the meat of the issue; they want my transcripts from the Craft College.  Oh Jesus. Withdrawl- Withdrawl- Withdrawl- Withdrawl-......oh, they're gonna love that.  But Dr. Deb Johnston, my guardian angel political science prof. knows all about my poor academic standing at the old College of Craft and Design.   Surely she's still going to let me come to UNB in the fall?       I'm jobless and stressed out.  I'm just barely treading water.  My parents are poorer than i am. Dana's working 20 hours a day.    He's losing his mind.       Laura just called and she wants money.  I can't wait until this month from hell dies and rots in the ground.

       Hey whats up  I feel great. Better than i have in a long time! Yay!!   Tomorrow i must beg to be let into UNB.  I wonder if dropping Greggy's name would help my chances? (:  I'll be talking to Dr. Deb Johnston.   If i don't get in, I'll have to work full time somewhere, thats not something i ever look forward to.  I'm so fricking sick of working for other people. Making them money and bringing their customers back to their crap-ass stores while they pay me minimum wage.  Poeple shouldn't be making minimum wage unless they are 16 and babysitting.  I'm twenty-three.  Twenty-three and a half and counting...  I'm sure now that i'm an Entrepreneur, just one that has no money, and is just rediscovering the concept of self motivation.  I'd love to run a coffeeshop/giftshop.  I've got it all in my head - all i need to do is  look up the millions of miles of paperwork required to do so.  Dana and i are moving out together finally!   I'm pretty stoked (:  I'm going to Diane and Marlas this week to work at their store.   August
