      I decided to leave the house today wearing a baseball cap, no make-up, and 'comfy clothes' (so totally not attractive).  Kris and I decided to do lunch and some thrift store shopping.  About half-way through our trip, while chatting with her, I suddenly heard birds singing, and that "aaaahhhh" sound that the angels make when something wonderful is seen. And believe me, something wonderful was seen. The Most Beautiful Man. I can imagine that where-ever he is, people throw roses, and pen poems to his beauty.  I was dumbfounded. My jaw literally dropped, and I was unable to finish my sentence.  It was like there was only me and him in the world.  And what did I do, after I got over my awe.    Me: I just saw the most beautiful man in the world, Kris   Kris: Really, where?   Me: Umm... Oh, he can hear every word, right next to us. Shit.  [We casually walk further away]  Kris: Yep, you're right, he's the most beautiful man in the world, go ask for his phone number .  Me: You don't just go up to the most beautiful man and ask for his phone number. I'm so embaressed.   And he talked to me. We were waiting for a changing room, and asked if I wanted to go first.    The Most Beatiful Man: Did you want this room? I can wait.   Me: Oh Thanks so much.  [I scurry in quickly with a pink face]  I felt like I was in high school, and I'm disapointed that I didn't strike up a conversation. Looking at him, though, was like looking into the sun. If it was meant to be, I'm sure I'll meet him again.  Mmmm. The Most Beautiful Man.

                  Nick    (soccer coach, web-business owner, 25) - Ridiculous. Namely Myself. I said things like  "I Have low self esteem."  and " I've picked out my future children's names".  Who does that? We went to a museum, and barely talked to eachother because the popular conversation at that place was silence. After that, I didn't have enough cash to get out of the parking garage, so he had to pay the ten bucks for me. On top of everything, I left him a voicemail identifying myself as " the gal from Sunday ". I never heard from him, and I don't blame him! Ugh!      Sean   (Tennis Pro, Advertising, 29)      - Was fun. We went on approximately 4 dates. He started becoming strange. He stopped calling, then called non-stop. And he was very bossy. If someones is going to start telling me what to do after 4 dates, I just can't imagine what he's like when you really get to know him.        Kirk    (Foam Business) -   Was fantastic. We dated for a month. He had issues with using the telephone, which I was willing to overlook. He had issues with commitment, I think, which I never brought up, but he did in a roundabout way. I am totally willing to just date the guy and have fun, but he decided he really liked me, alot. Which meant he must commit, which he couldn't do at the moment, so he must not date me at all. What? Men, tell me, is this just some nice way to let a girl down easily? Well, I ended up with a great friend out of it. His roommate. : )       Phillip  (Teacher) - Was Sweet. Went on one date at a coffee shop. He was a nice guy, but we just didn't click. My loss, I'm sure.  And today I am meeting a chef. Not tall, dark and handsome. But taller than me, Tan, and definitely cute. I guess time will tell.

         I love this picture. It just makes me think. How inhabited the world is. How beautiful technology, and how beautiful it isn't.  I learned something new today, once I started thinking about how the earth isn't dark at the same time. It was done by time lapse photography. Learn something new every day.  I watched the ened of the Women's Marathon today, and it made me weepy. When Paula dropped out, the pain and exhaustion, and sadness on her face touched me. When the american woman pulled in and secured the bronze and cried her last lap in the stadium, I cried a little too. I love the Olympics.

        So I was scheduled to meet this guy that I've never met before this afternoon. An impromptu date. He was to show me around the local farmer's market. I slept in.(accidentally) I was supposed to meet him at 1230, but instead was jarred awake by Figero (Figs), my cat (he was pulling my hair), I woke up at 1:15. How embaressing is that? Calling someone 45 minutes after you were supposed to meet them to explain why they've been stood up?! Ugh! Thankfully, I was still half asleep while I was dialing the phone, so I had no time to chicken out/be too embaressed. Luckily, he was an easy going, nice guy, that even decided to reschedule for tomorrow. Is this in the stars or what? And to boot, he's a chef. And I am a dork!

      I witnessed a sad death, and a joyous birth at work tonight. I like to think sweet little Spencer's spirit was comforted a little by Jake, the first baby delivered tonight by a first time mother.  He entered the world the exact same moment Spencer left it.  May he have a happy life at the Rainbow Bridge.  It was a sweet few moments every time I helped Scrappy the Shar-Pei push out her little babies tonight. Jake was first, and questionably silent, but made an awesome comeback. Ralphie was next, and was a beautiful little girl, Cutie Pie kicked and wailed his way into the world, and it was humbling. I felt blessed to see and assist in a new baby being born, and witnessing it's first breaths. Who do I thank for this awe inspiring experience?  Whomever it is,   THANK YOU  .

        I've been thinking about this song for a few days now, and I finally heard it on the radio. I felt the need to save the words for posterity, so that I  can  keep reminding myself that for each ' failed ' relationship I've had, it's just a stumbling block for the great and meaningful one I'll be having in the future.  I know that I can be ridiculous with demands sometimes, and a pushover other times.  I need to work on things . :) And this song reminds me that  I can  and  I will .      Back of the Bottom Drawer by Chely Wright      In the back of the bottom drawer Of the dresser by our bed Is a box of odds and ends That I have always kept But the man who sleeps beside me Doesn't know it's even there Little pieces of my past That I shouldn't have to share A napkin that is stained with time Has a poem on it that didn't quite rhyme But it made me cry And a Dear Jane letter from a different guy He broke up with me and told me I'm not always right And a stolen key from on old hotel room door In the back of the bottom drawer I dont keep these things 'Cause I'm longin' to go back I keep them because I wanna stay right where I'm at I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs I dont wanna mess this up But I wouldn't know where I belong Without this box of stuff A birthday card from my first boyfriend He signed it I love you so I gave in Yea we went too far in his daddy's car And those mardi gras beads from '98 We danced all night stayed out so late We thought we were stars Closin' down the bars That champagne was cheap But still I got that cork In the back of the bottom drawer I'm not tryin' to hide these things From the man I love today But I'm a better woman for him Thanks to my yesterdays So now I try to give more than I take And I bite my tongue fight the urge to say It's my way or no way at all And now I cherish love a whole lot more 'Cause of what's in the back of the bottom drawer

      I am becoming a vampire.  This new shift at work is sucking the life out of me. I'm ashamed to say I slept in until 2 this afternoon, and had just enough time to shower and jump into the car to make it to work on time.  At least I was lively and happy at work, which is more than I can say for myself usually.   I suppose it doesn't help that most of my friends have normal day jobs that go till 4 or 5, which is when I'm starting. Pretty soon it's going to be just me and my computer.  What a life. :)
