       X2 Update:   I can't read.  Apparently Gambit and Beast make brief appearances in the new movie.  Sweet!  Just check the full cast list for X2 at IMDB.  My desire to see this film as just increased.  I didn't think that would be possible.

       "Hey, hey, it's me!"  "Prove it."  "You're a dick."  "Ok."   I'm sure that y'all haven't missed the media blitz regarding  urlLink X2: X-Men United , which was released in theatres today.  The above little thing is probably one of my favorite pieces of dialogue from the orginial movie.  I'll probably refresh my mind this weekend by viewing the first movie.  I used to read the comic and watch the cartoon when I was younger and I remember nearly having a heartattack when I was sitting in the theatre and seeing the preview for the first movie for the first time.  It had taken me by complete surprise.  I couldn't even tell you what movie I saw that day because I had seen a preview for  X-Men , complete with  Wolverine !  I think I have a Wolverine action figure sitting around somewhere too.  I suppose telling you my favorite character at this point would be redundent.  Though I will say that I will not be completely satisfied with the movies until Gambit makes an appearance. I haven't seen the new film yet and I won't until about a week from now, but as far as I know, from  urlLink IMDB , that he had yet to make it into the film series.  When everyone's favorite card-carrying Cajun makes an appearence I'll be satisfied.  Beast would be a nice addition as well.  I'll try to write up a little personal review after I see the movie and anyone who even tries to tell me details about it should seriously reconsider.  If you've seen it, cool... just don't tell me about it. ;-)

       One More Thing...   The vets also had one more wonderfully intelligent thing to say.  I'm sure most have heard about the whole  urlLink Dixie Chicks  thing.  But, as some of you may recall, and the history major in me will gladly remind you, there is this little, obscure document called the Constitution.  And there is this little thing called Amendment I.  You should  urlLink read it .   That whole free speech thing.  How were the Chicks being un-American by practicing an American right?  Hmm...  urlLink some people  just don't think things through sometimes.

       Look Out For Charlies....   Today was a rather interesting day.  This semester, I enrolled in a class called the Vietnam War and the American Imagination.  We read various books and watched a few movies related to the war.  Today, though, was by far the most interesting and worth the  urlLink exuberant price  of the class.  We had a panel of Vietnam Vets talk to us and answer our questions.  It was good to hear it from the source rather than just read accounts.  One guy went back 3 times because of the way the soldiers were being treated when they got home... the whole ridiculous "baby killer" nonsense.  He said he felt safer in Nam than he did here.  Sad, so very very sad.  Another statistic thrown at us by guys who know.... 58,000 U.S. soldiers were killed in Nam.  However, 3 times that many committed suicide after the fact.  Let's just hope this country has learned their lesson as far as that's concerned.

       The First Real Post   In local news today...local meaning that it concerns the school I attend, which would be  urlLink St. Norbert College  (SNC)... a student from the school has gone missing.  A little freaky, but they don't suspect it happened on campus.  She was an older student and had been living off-campus with her husband.  She was also an ESL (English as a Second Language) student.  They found her car about 2 or 3 miles from campus at a bar she had never went to before.  Her husband had been away in Upper Michigan and she hadn't been in classes either Monday or today.  Just creeps me out a bit.  Granted, I graduate on May 10th, but still the concern is there.  No real way for them to determine that the incident, whatever it may be, has its roots on campus.  I'll keep y'all updated on the situation.  Fell free to drop me an  urlLink e-mail  if you want.

       One Day More....   Tomorrow I graduate.  I don't think the fact that I won't be going back to school next year probably won't hit me until the end of the summer when I don't have to buy books, school supplies or anything.  I'm working on getting a job.  I sent an application to the  urlLink Minnesota Historical Society  and I hope to hear from them next week sometime.  I have one more exam in about an hour and a half.  Do I care?  Not really.  My last exam for a very long time, possibly forever.  I'm getting an AB in that class so if i bomb this final, I still pass.  I should be studying but I'm not.  Well, technically I should be  working  but I'm not.  I have the next hour off so I'm going to go to the library where everyone in this class is going to be gathered, frantically trying to study for this exam.  I'm really not all that worried.  Senioritis kicked in majorly last week.  And yesterday it was in full force.  It did so in the middle of my Politcal Science exam.  I got to the middle of the second essay and just said "fuck it" and quickly finished it in about four sentences.  I really stopped caring.  I hated that class anyway.  As far as tomorrow, I'm very glad that my dad and his family are going to be there along with Chad's dad.  That means that my mom's family (see previous entry) can't pull quite as much shit with me.  If they do, I have people to go to that will put them in their place.  I would do it, but they have a problem listening to me.  In their minds, I'm still 10 years old.  Fuck 'em.  I'm sick of being nice and giving them what they want.  My life, my choices and they just have to fucking deal with it.  This is one reason why I am not going to the surprise birthday party for my uncle's friend tonight (the first reason is Chad is going to be arriving during it and I want to be home when he gets there).  I'm glad that Josh gave me the head's up on the lecture that I'm supposedly receiving from my uncle.  I have a feeling he'd plan it for tonight when my mom's entire family is also there to back him up and directly attack me.  Ha ha!  I'm not going to be there!  I'd  love  to see him try to lecture me tomorrow in front of my dad and Chad's dad.  He wouldn't get to say very much.  That brings an idea to mind.  I should probably sit by my dad tomorrow for the dinner after graduation.  I'm feeling very confrontational right now and I know it will only be worse tomorrow.  I know I'm going to be on edge, just waiting for them to start giving me shit.  Yeah... I think sticking to Chad, Dad and Wayne (Chad's dad) would be a good idea.   I can't wait to move to Minnesota.

       Never ever get married....   ... if you have a family like my mom does.   ARGH!  It isn't worth the stress and anger.  Aren't weddings supposed to be happy things?  Aren't family members supposed to act  happy  for you?  Aren't they supposed to stop treating you like a fucking 12 year old and trust you to make your own god damn decisions?  Am I angry and bitter?  No, of course not.  Let me give you some wonderful examples of how they are pissing me off:  1.  I go to show my grandma my wedding dress on Monday.  It was the sample, not the actual one, but still.  Her comment?  "It's pretty but I wish it had more on the top."  What the fuck?  I won't go into great detail about the dress cuz my fiance stops by the site once and a while, but I'll say that more on top?  What?  I don't understand you and your freaky deeky Dutch.  Dammit.  2.  Ok.  I'm from Wisconsin.  Lived here my whole life.  In four days, I'm moving to Minnesota permentantly.  My wonderful Chad is there.  Wonderful jobs are there.  Living there means the wedding is going to be there.  We will be living there and it will be a hell of a lot easier to plan the wedding.  This was an issue, but doesn't seem to be one as much anymore.  They could return to it.  Who knows.  My mom did say that none of my father's family was going to come.  Bullshit.  They all went to my cousin's wedding in Hudson, WI.. a whole 45 minutes away from the Twin Cities area where we live.  I've talked to them.  They're coming.    3.  The church issue.  This one probably won't be settled until some time after the wedding and maybe not even then.  Fuck 'em.  My family is very Catholic.  I'm not.  Chad's not.  Our wedding.  See where I am going with this?  Monday, as my grandmother is bringing me back to my mom's, we drive past the new St. Matt's church.  She was going on and on and on about how beautiful it is.  She's saying this to someone who has seen the Catherdrals at Strasbourg, Reims, Chartres and Notre Dame in Paris.  I highly doubt this modern church meets my views of beautiful.  So I just shrugged at her comment.  I haven't seen the new church because I don't go to church.  So she says, in response to my shrug "Why are you so anti-church?"  I tell her it's my opinion.  She tells me "If you were with someone who went to church, I bet you would go too."  Excuse me?  What the fuck did you just say?  Lucky for her she was driving and I don't particularly like to hit drivers.  One more comment like that about Chad and I swear... grrrrrrrrr.  4.  Later on monday, my brother, Josh, informs me that my uncle is going to lecture me when he gets up here for my graduation.  He can lecture me all the fuck he wants about supposedly getting married too early and wanting to have a family too early.  This is coming from a man who has never married and does not have kids.  If he thinks for one moment that I am just going to sit there and take his shit, he has another thing coming.  That side of the family has to learn to stop fucking with me and learn to let me grow up.  I'm 22 and they treat me like I'm 12 and don't know what I'm doing..ever.  People who never got beyond high school telling a soon to be college grad that she's dumb.  Lovely.     There... done for now.  Feel free to  urlLink email me .

       Fini   I have passed all my classes and graduated.  I am no longer a student.  At least for a few years or something.  The whole graduating thing was all right except that the speaker was sooooo fucking boring.  Everyone clapped for him and gave him a standing ovation  because he finished .  The job search continues and hopefully I'll have something by next week or an interview at the very least.  I am also a Minnesotan now.  Well, not quite yet, I still have to acquire a state ID and change my mailing address, but yeah...  Chad graduates this Sunday and both my mom and dad and their sig. others are coming for that.  I know that I get to drag my mom to the  urlLink Mall of America  on Saturday and there is a possible trip to the  urlLink Cracker Barrel  Friday night for dinner.  Chad's going to help modify some things on this page and hopefully I'll have comments by the end of this month.  Oh yeah.  Finally saw X2 today.  I see X3 in the future and I bet I know at least part of the story for it as well.  Maybe being psychic is my mutant ability.

       Fini, Part Deux   Chad has now also graduated.  He got his BA in English from the  urlLink U of M .  As stated in the previous entry, even some of my family came to his graduation.  My mom and step-dad couldn't make it because in the middle of the week, Pete (step-dad) found out he had walking pneumonia.  So no 300 mile trip for them.  Understandable, and hopefully they can make it for Chad's grad party.  The day went well for the most part (more on that in a bit, let me focus on the good stuff first).  After his graduation, his dad, Joe (that would be his younger brother), Chad and myself had lunch at  urlLink White Castle .  Ugh.  My stomach cannot handle that place and I think I'm going to finally swear off eating there.  Then for dinner Dad and Vicki (his girlfriend) took us to  urlLink Kozlak's .  Yum!  Very good steak with rather rich prices, but, hey, we weren't paying and the steak was awesome, so I'm not going to complain too much about it.    Ok, now the bad part.  Notice how I have not mentioned Chad's mom being at his graduation yet.  Well there is good reason for that.   She wasn't there.   Didn't bother to fucking show up.  Oh she knew.  We had been calling her everyday all last week just to remind her of it.  Yes, she forgets easily.  But that wasn't even her excuse because she called today asking how it went.  We weren't around and Joe gave us the message.  She had to work.  That was her fucking excuse.  Her oldest child graduates from college and  she had to work at a job she doesn't need .  What do I mean by that?  Her husband has money and told her she doesn't need to work, she's just helping a friend get her new business off the ground.  Doing her a favor.  She's only been there 2 weeks.  She knew about the fucking graduation.  Work... fucking lame.  She could have at least come up with a better excuse.  Her car broke down, she got lost, she was sick.... almost anything would have been better than saying she had to work.  It like she planned not to go to it.  She asked Joe if she could buy a tape of it and watch it.  Fuck.  That's something you go to, not watch on TV.  Chad hasn't bothered to call her yet.  If she can't make time for him, why should he do the same for her.  Work.  My dad took off of 2 days of work, he's actually missing both jobs today, to come to this AND travelled 600 miles round trip to do it.  Work.  Fucking lame.  Oh yeah, when she called she was out to dinner at the same Perkins that Chad and I were at, just in the smoking section.  Joe told her.  She didn't bother to say hello.  I think it was her car parked next to Chad's when we left.  Probably the best for her because I cannot honestly say I would not have made a scene.  She has it coming in my opinion.  Comments?

       X2 vs. The Matrix Reloaded - Whoa... Little Competition, Bub   ***WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD***  Ok, I know it's a little delayed.  I've seen  urlLink X2  (want to see it again in the very worst way) and I've seen  urlLink The Matrix Reloaded .  Let's just say the X2 improved on X-Men while The Matrix Reloaded did not really improve on The Matrix.  One major, major problem I have with TMR is that is seemed to be laid out as such:  action, lots of dialog, lots of action, lots of dialog, etc, etc.  I zoned out half way through the speech by the Architect.  And the scene in Zion with the dancing and the .... yeah.  The action scenes were awesome and I don't regret spending the money on it, don't get me wrong, but I was somehow expecting more.  In short, it didn't live up to the hype.  X2 however, did live up to the hype.  So cool a movie.  I could be biased too.  I used to read the comics many years back.  Part of me wishes I kept up with it.  But I would have to acquire nearly 8 years of back issues in order to catch up. That would be a good chunk of change.  Maybe someday.  BUT the movie was awesome.  The start of the Phoenix Saga...sweetness.  Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine.... need I say anything?   Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and the bamfing... sweet.  I enjoyed every last minute of that movie and I want to see it again (anyone interested? E-mail me!)  and I will be one of the first in line for the DVD.   In short:  Wolverine hands Neo his ass.

       Hoping to Get a  urlLink Great Jorb    Well I have a job interview for Friday at  urlLink Uline .  They sell shipping supplies.  If I get the job, they'll give me money and benefits, which is fine by me.  Granted, I could probably get a higher paying job than what I'm interviewing for, but I just want a job period so I have some income.  If I only have this job for a year, well, then I only have it for a year.  Chad, on the other hand, is still in the job hunting mode, waiting to hear from someone...anyone.  At least with the call back I got today, we both know there isn't some blackhole eating all of our resumes.  I had a list of a dozen places I sent my resume to over the past 2 weeks.  Two companies said they did not have a position for me at this time and they would keep my resume on file for future reference blah blah blah.  The other places may not exist.  I don't know.  I haven't heard from them.  And if Chad doesn't have a job by the time he ends his current job at the U of M, his car would go in my name if I get the job at Uline.  I, who currently has no license, would have a car, a rather new one at that, in my name.  Stranger things have happened I guess.  In other news, the trim on the house here is finished so no more squirrels and bats and other mammels can get in the walls and the roof no longer leaks.  It can rain all it fucking wants and we no longer have to worry about emptying out pans and bowls in the middle of the night.  I hope it pours tonight.  Chad, Joe and Jesse (Chad's good friend) helped clean out some shit in the basement tonight.  Apparently there was a bunch of wood and sheet of broken glass that the previous owner left in the basement.  The previous owner was Sheila's ex-husband.  Sheila is now married to Chad's dad.  So there you go.  I think that's it for now.    Comments?  Questions?  E-mail:  jennifer.borley@snc.edu

       Baby, Baby   Thanks to the wonderful invention of the internet, I have been able to get to the  urlLink Green Bay Press Gazette's  records so that I can keep an eye out for when my friend Lea has her baby.  Well, she delivered a baby boy yesterday, which was also her due date.  A timely little fellow.  Having the baby born on the actual due date is a rare occurance it seems.  I was born 2 days late, my brother was born 3 days early, Kate (my friend Amy's little girl) was born a week early.  If I remember correctly, the name Lea had picked out for a boy was Drew... or Andrew and just call him Drew.  I remember her saying this because she mentioned that Renae would also like it.  And Renae likes the name Drew and any male with that name  ;-).  Hence the connection.  So if you know Lea, congratulate her!    In Other News....   My interview at Uline seemed to have went well.  The guy who interviewed me said he would give me a call by Wednesday (tomorrow) to let me know if they will be hiring me or not.  Chad has also finally heard from someone about a job.  Funny how the one job he wants in the very worst way is the one job that gets in contact with him.  He's going for the position of online editor at  urlLink Game Informer  magazine.  If you are a gamer like Chad and myself, this is one hell of a job to get.  Review games before they are released, go to game conventions such as E3, etc, etc.  I'll keep y'all updated on our job situations.  Hopefully we'll both have paychecks soon.   Questions? Comments?

       urlLink  The Crackers of Connivery    I'm a frickin' moron and I twisted my ankle pretty badly on Saturday.  Stupid stadium seating movie theatres with their stairs.....  Chad had his graduation party on Sunday and it went well. It rained a couple times when some small showers past over but otherwise it was a good time with me on crutches  Go me.    Oh, and Lea did name her son Drew.  My grandparents maybe stopping in the Twin cities area on Thursday as they head back to Arizona.  They're taking a new scenic route.  Uline didn't hire me.  I have another interview for Friday at MT Advertising.  Chad has an interview fro Monday with Blue Ridge Marketing and a possible interview with .....  wait for it..... Uline on Friday.    For those back in GB, Chad and I will be around the weekend of the 20th, possibly getting there on the 19th depending on jobs and interviews or whatever.  New Metallica CD came out on Thursday.  I like the first few songs and the rest have yet to grow on me.  I especially enjoy the first song, "Frantic."  Chad and I will be seeing Metallica, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Deftones anf Mudvayne at the end of July.  Should be a goddamn good time.

       Life Sucks and Then You Get Cancer   I'm warning you ahead of time, this is not a chipper-cheery posting.  Yesterday, at about 8pm, I called my mom because my step-dad, Pete, was having surgery.  Why?  Well, at the beginning of May he was starting to have very bad coughing fits.  As stated in a previous post, he developed walking pneumonia.  No problem, that went away, but he was still doing the coughing fits that were preventing him from doing essential things like sleeping.  So they went to the doctor again.  They then found out that his right lung had collapsed and was filling with fluid.  They took 3 quarts of fluid out and he felt better but the doctor said that there might be something else wrong so they had to go see a specialist on Monday.  So they did that and the specialist said that Pete needed surgery to find out what it is, so they did that yesterday.  Well, the "something else wrong" turned out to be cancer.  As of yesterday, my mom didn't know what kind it was or how much there was because the pathologist still had to analyse it.  That and she freaked out after the word cancer left the doctor's mouth.  Her and Pete are not taking the news well.  I'm not certain, but I think cancer claimed both of his parents.  You know, sometimes I wonder why all the good people in this world have all the bad shit happen to them.  Pete had polio when he was 3 and has never been able to run since then because his right leg and foot are practically useless.  Don't you think that's enough to deal with?  He's helped my mom, myself and my brother out so much over the past 6 years, this is the last thing he deserves to get.  Even my dad said that he would not wish cancer on his worst enemy.  (And Pete is not an enemy, for the record.  Quite the contrary.  My dad has a lot of respect for him.)  My grandparents had just arrived back in AZ but now they're thinking about coming back next week to WI to help out my mom and Pete since Pete cannot go back to work for at least 6 weeks and that's just to recover from the surgery.  Then they get to find out about treatment for the cancer.  Chad and I will be heading to WI on Friday about 1pm because Chad has training for a possible job until noon otherwise we would be gone already.  I'll be staying in WI all next week to help oiut while my mom is at work and hopefully my grandparents will get there sometime before next weekend when Chad will come back and we'll go back to MN (Chad has interviews next week, which is why he can't stay.)  If you would like to send a card to Pete, and I encourage that you do, and you don't know the mailing address, please feel free to e-mail me at jennifer.borley@snc.edu  In other news, I didn't want the job at MT Advertising because they didn't offer benefits, which is not kosher with me.  However I had another interview yesterday that seemed to go well and I hope to get this job.  I think I have one-up on everyone else because the lady who interviewed me had a niece and nephew that graduated at SNC the same time I did and her nephew now works at GB Packaging (To the person who works at GB Packaging who also reads this blog: I don't know if he's available, but his name is Matt.)  Anyway, that's it for now.  Questions?  Comments?  E-mail:  jennifer.borley@snc.edu

       Home Again, Home Again, Jiggidy Jig   Well, I'm back in MN after spending a week in WI.  Got to see some of my friends while I was back home and that was cool.  Pete is doing well.  He had his first chemo treatment on Wednesday without any adverse effects, so hopefully things continue that way.  Granted, he and mom are worried about losing the house since Pete cannot return to the job he had previously because working there is what gave him the cancer in the first place.  Of course, smoking didn't help, but it wasn't the sole reason for the cancer.  I think that they'll be fine as far as the house is concerned.  They're doing all sorts of things to save a little money here and  there.  For instance, my mom bought a new Monte Carlo back in January.  Well, she sat down and realized that she didn't need a car like that to simply drive back and forth to work and run a few errands.  So, she tranded her 6 month old car in for a new Cavelier.  Between car payments and insurance they're already saving $125 a month.  My brother is supposed to be moving out of the house by August sometime to work for my uncle in Dallas and for Mom and Pete to get that kid off of their insurance would save them a lot more money too.  In the end I think it'll all work out.  The job search continues.  I did not get the job at Gage & Gage (I referred to having an interview in the June 18th post).  However, tomorrow I have to set up an interview with a law firm tomorrow to be their messenger bitch and I applied for 10 other jobs today so hopefully I'll hear something soon.  I knew I was going to have problems with getting a job, but I thought that I would have something by now.  Nearly 50 employers have received my resume and I've had 3 interviews and I'm setting up the 4th tomorrow.  Chad has applied for nearly 100 jobs (I kid you not) and hasn't had many more interviews than myself.  Granted, I think I'm applying for jobs that may be a little below me, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  Hopefully we'll both have something soon cuz my monetary funds are heading towards the red.  Also, my comments have seemed to have disappeared since Blogger modified their site.  Hopefully this will be fixed soon.

       "But  Why  Is the Rum Gone?!"   First 3 days of work are completed.  I think with all the walking I'm going to be doing for this job, I'll easily lose enough weight to fit into my wedding dress when the time comes for that.  So far so good... that's my job review.  Last night, Tricia and I went to see  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean .  Excellent, excellent movie.  I was afraid that a movie based on a theme park ride was going to suck.  I was mistaken.  (The title of this entry is a quote from said movie.)  While Orlando Bloom is in the movie and he qualifies as eye candy for a lot of females, Johnny Depp steals the show hands down.  Every single scene he is in is highly entertaining.  I hope to see it again with Chad sometime soon.  Perhaps next weekend when I'll have the money for it.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  I think it is one of the biggest surprise movies of the summer.  In other movie news, there are tentative plans to see  urlLink The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  tomorrow.  If we see it, I'll post another mini review here.

       Working 8:30 to 5...ish   Ok, so it's not quite 9 to 5, but at least it's a job.  37.5 hours a week verses a solid 40.  Yes, that's right.  After two months of unemployment and numerous applications and interviews, I finally have a job.  It's at a law firm,  urlLink Gray Plant Mooty , in downtown Minneapolis.  At the end of the year, we'll be moving into the IDS Tower.  For those of you who may not know, the IDS Tower is the tallest building in the Twin Cities area having some 57 or so floors.  Oh, and as a note, the IDS Tower is  not   urlLink the one with the UFO landing platform on top .   urlLink It's the one with what looks like a string of Christmas lights lining the top of the building (at night).  Well... I need to get to bed since I have to get up in about 7 hours or so.  Man, getting back on a decent sleeping schedule is going to suck for a while.  Here's to my career.

       Of Perks, Baseball and Dark Lords   Ok, I realized yesterday, after Chad pointed it out to me, that I completely forgot to mention the fact that I went to the Twins game on Wednesday night.  One of the perks with my job is that almost every day someone sends out a company email selling  something .  Very often it's tickets.  In this case, Twins tickets.  One of the attoneys was selling tickets located 4, count 'em, 4 rows behind home plate.  I wish I had my freakin' camera with.  I could have snapped some lovely shots of Mientkiewicz, Pierzynski, etc.  Even though the Twins lost (which always seems to happen when I go to a game), we still had a good time.  Two rows in front of us were some really funny guys calling out things to the Royals players.  Probably one of the most humorous was when the Royals catcher took his mask off to talk to someone and one of them yelled "Put your mask back on!  (pauses and looks around him)  You're ugly!"  The quote may not read as very humorous, but the way he said it was.  Later in the game, one of them was trying to tell the Royals batter to hit the ball right to the short stop for a nice double play.  It didn't happen, even though he said "please."  The game also proved, once again, that fans are not completely impervious to injury.  One girl a couple sections over from us got beaned in the face with a foul ball and a little later on of the Royals forgot how to hold on to his bat when he swung and sent it flying into the stands.  Luckily with our seats, we were situated behind the ball net, so we were fine as long as the ball didn't fly high enough to just make it over the net.   For those of you who frequent the  urlLink Penny Arcade  website, you've been hearing.. well, reading... Tycho's comments about Knights of the Old Republic, a new game available on PC and Xbox.  Now I wish that we still had an Xbox.  I love the fact that in this game your personal choices decide whether you are on the light side or dark side.  I've never been one for playing games on a PC, even though I do play the Sims and Age of Empires II from time to time, I much prefer lounging on a couch or in bed with a controller.  I've never really paid much attention or really played any of the Star Wars games with the exception of Rogue Squadron, but KOTOR intrigues me because it sounds similar in concept with Morrowind (my game of choice from last summer).      About Morrowind: For those of you who may be unfamiliar with Morrowind, it's a huge RPG with an estimated 400 hours of game play.  Yes,  400 , not 40.  It also allows you to do pretty much whatever you want.  Granted, yes, there are missions you have to accomplish, but you can take your time doing them and complete little side missions as well.  My character was an assassin.  Need I really say more?  Anyway, in Morrowind, you earned reputation points.  The more points you had the more famous/infamous you were.  Being an assassin was tough though.  The guards in towns always seemed to know when you killed someone, even if it was in a house and completely silent.  And the guards would beat the shit out of you if they caught you.    urlLink This comic displays this wonderfully .  Anyone who enjoys RPG games would like this too.  Back to KOTOR: Basically, it's this quote especially that got me really wanting this game:   "Dark Lords don't fuck around, they have very special projects that need working on and all of them involve hurting people. Not even for any reason. It is as though there is always a big Hurting People competition coming up, and you would like to make the hurting seem effortless."   I want this game and the Xbox it requires.  Now that I'm a working woman, maybe it'll happen soon.  And I could get Morrowind as well and start a new game for that.

       A Tale of Work and Play   I finished reading  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  on Tuesday.  I enjoyed it, even though the newest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher would anger me to the point of wanting to throw the book (those who have already read the book know what I mean.)  The fact that I read about 500 of the 870 pages while at work tells you how busy it's been here.  Not very.  Hell, the fact that I'm blogging  while at work  should say the exact same thing.    I enjoy my job, very low stress level and all that, but the downtime sometimes drives me up a wall.  I feel somewhat useless, especially when I'm sitting at my own desk off of the supply room and all of these busy attoneys and paralegals and the like some walking in and can plainly see me just sitting here, typing away ot playing a game or reading a book.  The downtime is especially abundant when the part-time messenger is working and the facilities department has nothing for me to do so I'm also messenging.  So three people doing a job that only requires two on a really busy day.  I've been here two weeks and I've only gone home with sore legs and feet on 3 days, my first three days on the job.  I guess I'm just so used to having jobs that you're supposed to be doing something all the time or else you're slacking off has just made me a bit paranoid.  Hell, it's all right for me to even get a bit of shopping done while on the job.  For example, today is Thursday and every Thursday there is a Farmers' Market on Nicollet Mall which my building is nice and close to.  It would be  perfectly fine  for me to pick up a few things on my way back from a run.    I do get to do quite a bit of walking though.  We have a certain zone of downtown that we deliver documents to, sometimes we go out of that zone after making people beg for us to do it.  Derek (the person I replaced) told me that sometimes there are even trips to the Metrodome to drop stuff off and, in return, Twins tickets are usually handed over since it's a good 5-6 blocks out of our zone.  For example, earlier today I had to drop of some papers at a place located down by the river.  Our building is located nowhere near the river.  So I took the bus for most of the way there.  I walked there and back earlier in the week and it takes about an hour and a half round trip by foot, only 45 minutes if I take the bus part of the way.  On Tuesday someone tried to get us to go pick up something at one of the U of M libraries.  That simply was not going to happen.  On a different note, this Sunday is the marathon concert Chad and I are attending at the Metrodome.  Deftones, Mudvayne, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit and Metallica.  Monday is going to be a very sluggish day for me at work.  But I think the concert will be worth one sluggish day at work.  That reminds me... the Dome is loud. I should get some disposable ear plugs.

       A Quick Little Update   I just started reading  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  yesterday.  I know I'm about a month behind 90% of the world, but between Chad reading it first, me being in Wisconsin for a week and starting a new job, I really haven't had the time until now.  I'm about 200 pages into it and I'm enjoying it so far.  I won't say anything about it since I'm not sure who has read the book and who hasn't.  Friday night, Chad, Joe and I went to see  Johnny English . If you're ever in the mood for somewhat mindless humor, it's a good movie for that.  My favoritr character was English's sidekick, Bough.  Yesterday, Chad and I went to a matinee of Pirates of the Caribbean since Chad had yet to see it.  It was still an excellent movie the second time around.  Other than the aforementioned things, nothing else has really been going on.  So... umm... yeah.  Till next time.

       Rock On   As some of you know, Chad and I attended the Mudvayne/Deftones/Linkin Park/Limpbizkit/Metallica concert at the Metrodome on Sunday.  The music was good and well done and enjoyable but it was all the other bullshit that made Chad and I come to the conclusion that we will not be going to another concert for a long time.  First of, the Deftones didn't show up due to one of their members having a stomach virus/groin injury/ "shaving accident". I've heard three different stories from three different sources (deftones website, radio and James Hetfield, respectively) but what matters is that they weren't there.  Metallica was scheduled for 9pm stage time because (we think, anyway) that they were the 93X Sunday Night Concert.  The concert started at 3.  We didn't get out of there until 11.  8 hours....  There was about 1 hour between each band which was waaaaay too long.  The downtime turned into a breast fest.  Three guys sat down in front of us, in seats that were not their's, and started on a pocket bong or something, the smoke from it coming right back at Chad and I.  The people to our left couldn't sit in their goddamn seats for more than 5 minutes.  The woman to our right tried to pick a fight with a guy 2 rows in front of her who was about twice her size and had sleeve tattoos and piercings everywhere (even his neck).  But waiting for Metallica made it all worth while.  They know how to put on a show.  Maybe a few years down the road, if they come back to the Minneapolis area, I'll go see them again, but not if 4 other bands accompany them.  That was just ridiculous.

       Rat Race   As I'm sure that all of you are now aware, Arnold Schwarzenegger is running for Governor of California.  I don't consider myself to be conservative enough (or at all) to be Republican, but I am so tempted to buy a "Arnold for Governor" pin just for the novelty of it.  If you yourself are interested in purchasing any Schwarzenegger for Governor items, so far the best place seems to be eBay.  Most of it seems "unofficial" and I probably won't end up buying any of it, but hey, it's an odd,  historical  situation.

       A Bit of a Downer   So today I call my mom to talk to her about a couple things, like when to get my dress fitted and what not.  Apparently Buckley (her 3rd child who happens to be a 4 year old cocker spaniel) is pretty sick.  This is a downer for me.  At first the vet thought it was a sinus infection and allergies, but he was throwing up today and Josh had to run him to the vet and they're keeping him overnight for observation.  I hope they find out what's wrong with him soon.

       Oh Yeah.....   The KOTOR problem has been solved and I no longer hate the game.  In fact, this game has what's probably the best storyline since Empire Strikes Back and with a plot twist that (i think anyway) is just as shocking.  I don't know how Chad felt about it, but for me it was unexpected, out of left field, but they had been dropping subtle hints  the entire time .  I went slack-jawed when it happened.  Amazing...   Of course, for Nassia Galloh, this twist will only be greatly beneficial.  Mwa hahahaha!

       Job Search Revived   Yes, my job search has revived itself after I have been employed for about 6 weeks.  As some of you know, and as I have briefly mentioned before, Chad and I are moving to St. Cloud which is about 60 or 70 miles northwest of the Twin Cities along Interstate 94.   Chad acquired himself a job at the St. Cloud Times as online editor, which will incorporate both his English degree and his computer skills.  One of the stipulations of that job was that Chad move to St. Cloud and since his job pays more and has more potential for advancement, we're going to move.  And I'm not going to commute 1-1.5 hours each way everyday if traffic and weather are  excellent,  so I'm on the job market again.  Hopefully it won't take too long for me to find a job and we can move to St. Cloud ASAP.  We're going to be looking at an apartment that caught our eye on Saturday and if it's as impressive as it seemed to be online, we're going to take it.  If I don't have a job by a possible September 1 move-in date, we're going to just stay there for the weekends and stay in Minneapolis during the week until I finally get a job up there.  I'm really hoping we won't have to do that.  I'll keep you updated on the situation.

       Don't Look Now, I'm Just a Friendly Reminder   Chad's mom is at home, resting and recovering extremely well.  Brain surgery on Wednesday, home by Friday.... that's something.  She was originally supposed to be in ICU until Sunday.  So, all goes well there.  Today is Joe's 21st birthday.  And Renae's Insert-Imaginary-Age-Here Birthday.  Renae, your present will be arriving within the week.  Chad and I might have an air conditioned apartment by September 1st.  For those who want to visit St. Cloud ever, just let me know and we can arrange for some lovely air conditioned environment and perhaps some swimming at the complex's pool.  As for now, it's fucking hot so I'm going to go stick my head in the freezer until we leave for Joe's Birthday dinner.  Whooo!

       !0! TI-I1I\IG5 48OUT I\/I3   There... that was my feeble attempt at typing something in l33t.  I don't know how well I did, but I blame the brief desire to do so on boredom at work and  urlLink Megatokyo .  For those of you who have no f'n clue as to what l33t is or how to translate it, here's the  urlLink free translation : "101 Things About Me."    I'm at work.  I'm bored, so I'm going to make a list of 100 things about me and see if I can actually do it and how interesting I can make it.  And for future reference, if you want to send a comment and my comments have disappeared, send it to jennifer_borley@hotmail.com.  All right, here we go:  1.  My middle name is Lynn 2.  I'm getting married in 2004, possibly June 3.  My fiance's name is Chad 4.  We have 2 cats: Kyle and Hetfield.  Kyle because he's black and white and so are cows and "Kyle" and "cow" start with the same letter... according to Chad.  Hetfield is named after James Hetfield of  urlLink Metallica  because was Hetfield (the cat) was a kitten, he was very vocal.  And we like Metallica. 5.  I'm moving to St. Cloud very soon 6.  I work on the 34th floor of a building downtown.  The view is cool. 7.  My mother is never home when I want to talk to her. (just tried calling her) 8.  I'm 5'6" tall 9.

Hamilton and J.K. Rowling 63.  I once got gum stuck in my eyebrows.  It was when I was 7.  I fixed the problem with a razor. 64.  My earliesy memory is driving up to St. Vincent hospital to visit my mom and see Josh for the first time.  I don't remember the actual visit, I just remember being in my grandma's Cavelier and that it was raining. 65.  During my first time in Arizona, I had to tell my grandparents how to get back to my uncle's house.  I was 8 years old and they had been there twice before. 66.  I own a sheet of 100 Adolf Hitler stamps circa WWII.  Gotta love  urlLink Ebay  67.  I also have a pair of magazines published at a publishing company that burned down and never reopened after the Great Chicago Fire. 68.  When I was in France, a group of us decided to test the theory that a coin can detail a train.  It doesn't work.  Not even 5 coins stacked on top of one another.  It was Jon Wolf's idea. 69.  Up until 4th grade (thank you Family Life) I used to think that women could get pregnant from kissing. 70.  I have a bad habit of dropping portable electronics and breaking them (went through 5 discmen before investing in an MP3 player) 71.  Sometimes I make writing mistakes so I have an excuse to use white-out 72.  I ride the bus to work everyday.  You can see some of the most interesting things/people when doing that... 73.  I intend to write a novel someday.  I have ideas, it's just getting them onto paper.  Of course, I currently have no intention of official publication because I don't think I'm  that  good. 74.  I think  urlLink Mental Floss  looks like the coolest magazine ever. 75.  I can't believe how hard it is to come up with more things for this list. 76.  Current videogame I'm playing:  Soul Calibur II    Characters that I'm trying out:  Taki, Nightmare, and Link (yes,  that   urlLink Link ) 77.  Did I mention I've seen Phantom of the Opera 26 times? 78.  There's someone with my  exact  name (middle name and everything) in Green Bay.  She works for Pampered Chef.  People tend to ask my mom if I work for Pampered Chef.  I don't.  She also goes to the same eye doctor as me.   79.  I like sleeping.  A lot. 80.  I'm very difficult to wake up in the morning... so I'm told. 81.  Mmmm... chocolate.... 82.  My favorite kind of donut is a long john with white frosting, no filling.  My mom ate them constantly when she was pregnant with me.  I wonder if that has anything to do with it. 83.   The other current video game:  Final Fantasy VII.  Yeah, I know I'm about 7 years late on this game, but after seeing the Gamefaqs.com video game character battle and hearing from Chad and Joe how cool FF7 is and what an awesome bad guy Sephiroth is (apparently the best villian ever) I thought I would check it out.  Can't say much about Sephiroth yet, since he's only been mentioned. 84.    You know what... I'll just add on to this later.  It's been a while since I've updated so..umm.. yeah.  I promise I'll get to 101...eventually.

        urlLink Stubblog    For those of you interested, this is something that Chad does while he's working.  It's for the  urlLink  St. Cloud Times Entertainment Page  and their mascot, Stubby the Fun Hound ( not  a Bassett Hound regardless of how much he resembles one).  Some clever stuff.  And yes, the dog on the page is actually Stubby (which is the dog's actual name because of his stubby legs).  He belongs to one of the employees at the St. Cloud Times.  I'm also trying to figure out my comments dilemma.  Who knows, maybe Chad can create something a little more reliable.

       New Home Sweet Home?   On Saturday Chad and I went to look at an apartment in St. Cloud.  Well, we signed an application and now we're just waiting for that to go through, which I doubt we'll have problems with that since Chad makes enough on his own to afford the place.  Speaking of affording it, our rent turned out to be cheaper than we orginally thought.  It was advertised as $750 a month but when we got there, the guy told us that it was the last day of a special they were running for $644 a month.  PLUS since we found the apartment on apartments.com we get 12 $50 off rent coupons.  So our rent will be $594 a month instead of $750.  How's that for a deal?  Perhaps I should provide you with a bit of a description.  The apartment is a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom number with walk in closets, a full sized washer and dryer in unit, a dishwsher, air conditioning, full sized refrigerator and microwave.  The building is only about 2 years old so that means all the appliances are also only 2 years old.  The building also has a pool, spa and fitness center and underground parking if we would so choose to utilize it.  Oh, and we'll have a balcony too.  My job search continues.  I did receive one call back but I have to return the call yet.  The person I need to contact only works from 9-1 so I need to call her from work.  Problem is that I keep forgetting the number at home.  One of these days.... one of these days.

       Where Have They Gone?  Where Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii*gasp*iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid They Go?  Eh, Bien, Raise Your Berets to Those Canaan Days    My current reading material is   urlLink Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Friend   by  urlLink Christopher Moore .  If you're really interested in seeing what this is completely about and if you want to read an excerpt, follow the links.  The basis of this book is filling in of the childhood, teen and early adult years of Jesus (Joshua) told by his friend Levi-also-known-as-Biff.  It's humorous and highly enjoyable, though I would not be surprised if the staunchly religious find it offensive.  If you enjoy the work of  urlLink Douglas Adams , Christopher Moore is an American version of him, as in, the sense of humor is about the same.  Reading this has made me want to listen to  Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat  in the worst way (hense the title of this blog) but I really can't until I gather all my shit from my mom's basement.  I think it's the humorous take on religion that caused it.

       It's 37 Degrees Outside, Do You Know Where Your Heat Is?    You do?  Well, congratulations!  You know something I don't.  It's freezing up here and the person who is in charge of the heat will not turn it on even though it is nearly freezing outside!  I guess if I get sick, I get sick.  Though I will not like it.  And may be a little pissy.  :-P  I'm tired.  Bed time.

       Late Night Television     Last night I had a difficult time sleeping so I stayed up and watched some TV. After watching the 1AM rerun of Family Guy (I still think Seth MacFarlane's face and voice don't go together...  urlLink he looks much younger  than he sounds and he sounds just like Brian...also I might add he's a very talented voice actor) I flipped through the channels and came upon Iron Chef. I don't know what it is about this show, but whenever I happen across it on Food Network, I have to watch some of it.  But they had the oddest metaphor last night..."Quail is a virgin.  Duck is a mature woman."  This was used to point out that a less experienced chef would be able to handle quail more easily than a duck because it's easier, and much smaller, to prepare and has a more mild flavor that's difficult to ruin.  I just found that really odd at 2AM.  Just, uh, thought I would share.  Anyway, time to go watch some more Family Guy.

Yes, exactly 50 years ago today my dad was born and the world was never the same.&nbsp; Because he spawned me.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; He's over in Europe somewhere, enjoying a 2 week cruise.&nbsp; Lucky. Oh well, it's not like he doesn't deserve it.  And if you haven't noticed, I've put a picture in my profile.&nbsp; Couldn't resist.

       I Would Guess the Ratio Would Be Something Like 1: 1,000,000   Odds are that I will be more likely to win the lottery than to get a job in St. Cloud.&nbsp; This town sucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no jobs unless you are an engineer or a nurse or can lift 50+ pounds.... and I am qualified for none of the aforementioned.&nbsp; My history degree isn't worth shit here.&nbsp; Never,  ever  move here.&nbsp; I'm  still  waiting for my unemployment to be processed and approved and it's been nearly a  month .&nbsp; I send them a form and they send one back saying I have to do this, this and, oh yeah, this before they can approve it.&nbsp; So I do those things only to be sent  another  form with 20 more things to do.&nbsp; Fuck!&nbsp; However, when/if it is approved it will be nice to have  some  income rather&nbsp;than all this money going out with nothing coming in and seeing my savings dwindle to nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe with people going back to school in about a month or so, some jobs will open up.&nbsp; I would not be completely adverse to working at Barnes & Noble or Waldenbooks or B. Dalton.&nbsp; If I end up at McDonald's or Wal-Mart  *shudder* &nbsp;(see previous post)&nbsp; then  everyone would know I was at my last resort.   Truth of the matter is that I don't  want  a job at all.&nbsp; The problem is that I  need &nbsp;one so that we can stay afloat economically.&nbsp; Unfortunately having the job as Mom doesn't pay cash, but that's perfectly fine.&nbsp; That doesn't effect the job satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coos and smiles make it all worth it.&nbsp; What happened to the time when a household could be supported by one income?&nbsp; And it isn't like Chad and I live beyond our means either.&nbsp; Hardly.   I never thought I'd say this but... I miss Green Bay.&nbsp; At least there I could get a fucking job!

       Space Aliens     &nbsp;  Tonight Chad and I tried a restaurant in the St. Cloud Area called  urlLink Space Aliens .&nbsp; This place intrigued us since we first saw it with it's bold exterior painted with an alien motif.&nbsp; We chose to go tonight because Chad found out through some of his co-workers that Wednesday is all you can eat ribs for $9.99.&nbsp; And they be some damn good ribs.&nbsp; Let me tell you a bit about the type of restaurant that it is.&nbsp; It's like a sci-fi Chuck E. Cheese's.&nbsp; And even though Erik may only be 2 months old, he was very interested in the bright colors and all the decorations.&nbsp; In a couple years he&nbsp;will be pulling on my arm and asking for tokens so he could play games.&nbsp; Ah, the things to look forward to.&nbsp; So, if you're ever in St. Cloud on a Wednesday and don't know where to go eat, go to Space Aliens.&nbsp; (They have a bar away from the kiddie stuff if that isn't your scene.)&nbsp; Oh yeah, and if you and your friends want to combine your game playing skills, you can get a Coleman tent in exchange for 10,000 tickets.&nbsp; I have one ticket that I acquired by using a token I found lying on the floor.&nbsp; Only 9,999 more to go.&nbsp; w00t.   Oh yeah, they had a pizza on their menu called Vampire Chicken Pizza.&nbsp; It had lots of garlic in the ingredients and supposedly would ward off the Vampire Alien.&nbsp; I never saw this Vampire Alien, then again, it was daytime.&nbsp; Or perhaps someone ordered this pizza and it does what the menu says it does.&nbsp; Who knows?

       Wal-Mart, How I Hate Thee...Let Me Count the Ways     &nbsp;  I hate Wal-Mart.&nbsp; I have for a long time.&nbsp; Yes, there prices are cheaper and all that, but almost every time I go to Wal-Mart I end up being more inconvenienced than saving a few pennies is worth.&nbsp; Give me a Target or Shopko any day.&nbsp; Yes, it is convenient to have a 24 hour Wal-Mart right up the road from me, especially when it's almost 11pm and we realize that we don't have enough formula left to feed Erik in the middle of the night. BUT it shouldn't take nearly an hour to acquire said formula from a place that's 2 blocks away. That's a another story....   What has brought on this tirade you may wonder?&nbsp; Well, I'll tell you.&nbsp; It took place at Sam's Club yesterday afternoon when Chad and I attempted to purchase a large canister of formula for Erik.&nbsp; We acquired said canister along with some tuna and some DVD-Rs and proceeded to check out.&nbsp; In our possession we had a rebate check for the formula.&nbsp; When the cashier tried to process it, it was denied.&nbsp; Thinking that the cashier&nbsp;was simply&nbsp;unsure of how to process it, we didn't think anything of it.&nbsp; However, it turned out that Wal-Mart (of which Sam's Club is a part of, if you didn't know) said that Chad had bounced a $3 check and was therefore blocked from using checks of any kind&nbsp;at any Wal-Mart company.&nbsp; Not only had Chad apparently bounced a check, but he did it in  Virginia .&nbsp; Now, I'm curious how that was accomplished since neither of us have ever been to Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad was steamed and so was I.&nbsp; We just wanted to buy some food for our son and go home.&nbsp; We were told that we had to call this company that works with Wal-Mart to figure this out.&nbsp; So Chad does this and is talking to someone from  India  about why he had a bounced check in  Virginia  when we live in  Minnesota .&nbsp; They run a credit check on Chad and everything is clear, but they can't fix the problem unless they do a check on me as well since I'm also on the Sam's Club account.&nbsp; I didn't have my ID on me while we were at Sam's Club, so we would have to call them back from home so they could make sure that I didn't write the bad check in Virginia.&nbsp; At this point Chad and I had had it and we left Sam's Club without any of our intended purchases.&nbsp; We proceeded to Target and were in and out within 15 minutes.&nbsp; The Sam's Club fiasco took about an hour.   Turns out, neither of us wrote a bad $3 check (duh, wouldn't our bank inform us if we did?) and the company in India has no idea why this occurred.&nbsp; But we still have to talk to Sam's Club and find out why the hell this happened to us.&nbsp; And we aren't the only ones this has happened to.&nbsp; The wife of one of Chad's coworkers had this happen to her as well.&nbsp;   Ugh...I hate Wal-Mart.

       Sleepless In Saint Cloud   This sucks. It's 3:38am and I am nowhere near tired. I even frickin' cleaned for an hour and a half and started packing some small things that we can do without for the next few weeks before we move. Ugh...that'll be fun. I'm calling my doctor tomorrow...er...later today about this sleeping problem because this is getting ridiculous. If I go to bed right now and fall asleep right away I'll get about 5 hours of sleep tonight,  maybe  6 if Erik feels like sleeping in. Great. I'll probably feel fan-skippin'-tastic for my interview in 12 hours. Well, I'm going to do some push-ups or sit-ups or something to try and tire myself out. It's almost time for Erik's early morning feeding and I haven't even been to bed yet. Dear lord.

       Interview With the Accounting Firm   Tomorrow I have an interview with a local accounting firm. The odd thing is, I find myself in a bit of a quandary. You'd think I'd be excited to have a good job prospect this soon, especially since it took me 3 months to find a job the last time I was unemployed. While I know I need the job because unemployment doesn't cover all of my expenses (not even close...stupid student loans) and it sounds like a nice place to work, I really don't want to go to this interview. The thing is, and this may sound weird, I'm afraid they'll offer me a job. Now, I know  exactly  why I feel this way: I like being a stay-at-home mom. I  love  it. Yes, it can be stressful if Erik is in a bad mood and, yes, it can be boring at times, but the reward of the job is so great that it makes it all worth while. I don't want to leave Erik in the hands of a daycare provider. Hell, I have a hard enough time leaving him in the hands of  my own mother  for a few hours let alone some stranger. I think the longest I've ever been away from him is 5 or 6 hours and that was just part of one day. How will I handle being away from him for 8 or 9 hours a day, 5 days a week? I know that if we ever win the lottery or come into a lot of money in another completely legal way, I'd give my 2 week notice that very day without hesitation.  Last year at this time I thought that I would be a gun-ho working mom when that time came in my life and the last thing I wanted to be was a stay-at-home mom. Well, now that time is here and I find myself wanting to be a gun-ho-stay-at-home mom and the last thing I want to be is a working mom. Just the thought of missing some major milestone in his young life frightens me. What if I miss his first step or his first word? Motherhood has changed my perspective on things much more than I ever thought it would. But in a good way. The fact that my time with Erik each day may become quite limited very soon is not something I'm comfortable with. Unfortunately the vast majority of families need to have both parents to work in order to make ends meet and we're part of that majority. But who knows? Maybe we'll win Publisher's Clearing House or Powerball one of these days.

       High On A Hill Was A Lonely Goatherd.... Ain't That Loverly?     I've been spending way too much time listening to The Sound of Music and My Fair Lady soundtracks. I guess I must be on some sort of Julie Andrews kick or something. But what can I say, it's feel-good music and god knows I need some feel-good music right now.   So....  (yes, I've been listening to that too.) My unemployment FINALLY went through and I FINALLY got my first check. I'm still applying for jobs as they pop up (which in St. Cloud, isn't often) and so far nothing. Not even an interview. I'm beginning to think my resume must be covered in cooties or something equally horrifying.  And a reminder.... Saturday, Saturday, Saturday! For one day only, for one hour only, Chad will be in the dunk tank at the Benton County Fair. Come one, come all and partake in the festivities. Chad tells me it's part of a fundraiser for the United Way.   I know it won't be the MN State Fair, but then from what I hear, what is? If you would like to join us on Saturday, drop me an email and I can give you some details, directions and whatnot.

      "A Fair Is a Fair! It's a Smorgasbord, Smorgasbord!"  I know where that little line is from, do you? Anyway, today was the day that Chad got to endure the dunk tank at the Benton County Fair. He was dunked plenty of times and even Erik got in on the action with a bit of help from Katie and Tricia. Chad's friend Garth ate all the fair food his stomach could handle. And my legs are sore from the walking and standing. I'm simply not used to it BUT I have to get used to it whether I want to or not. Especially if I ever want to fit in my wedding dress for whenever the wedding takes place.  And no, we do not have a date set. Hell, we don't even know what  time of year  we'd be getting married. However, if we happen to win the lottery or something, we'd get the wedding we want, where we want it and when we want it. It would have been nice to get married this summer since it has proved to be especially mild, but things were done a little out of order. Oh well. I would change a thing about it. Well, except for the whole no job thing. Who knows? That may be remedied by next week.
