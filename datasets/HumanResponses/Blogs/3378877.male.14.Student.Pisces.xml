      Hey-  * Finally got back from chicago! It was so fun, we did so much in so little time [I loved it!].   * We saw the 'Blue Man Group' and they were awesome! They played pipes and trashcans and stuff! It was so fun, and then at the end of the show they made it like a little rave party! it was awesome [Flashing lights, trance music, black light, streamers!]. That was my favorite part!  * The rest of the trip was fun, it was mostly museums and stuff but i liked it.   * Then we went shopping on Michigan Avenue! That was my second favorite part! We only had a half an hour though! So my group just went to Urban Outfitters! I love that store [there were a lot of gay guys in that store :)] [HAHA]   * OH YEAH! WE SAW A GIRL THAT WAS ON THE SHOW 'MADE'! IT WAS SO AWESOME!  * lol well that was my trip! I will have pics later to show you!  * kd

       HEY  * Today is the topic on  lesbian/bi girls at my school . Its not something I am proud of but its not anything that I can control. Which kind of sucks but then again I like people having their own thing even though there is like 10 girls in my school lesbian/bi:  - Hannah Biss. - Va'lyndi - Katherine - Alison - Summer - Ashley S.  * Ok, I thought for sure there was more but I guess not. Oh there will be later on I am sure of it!  * It's also strange how all of the lesbian/bi girls all smoke pot or cut themselves [haha]. Butits not my problem, I just wish that people would come out like the gay/bi guys. Then we would be a diverse school, which in ways would be cool [4 me anyway].  * Well thats about it, I'll write later tonight probably because I have a lot to say later on. I just cant think right now!   stay tuned   kd

       hey-  * Today was a day, most like all others. I got weird compliments like :  "Caeleb you look nice today" - Erin  "Caeleb you know how to dress unlike other guys!" - Lauren  * I have good friends [haha] I guess they like me.  * Another issue that needs to be addressed is the fact of friends who are friends with friends but not friends with friends friends [does that make sense?]. Hannah is like obsessed with Mallory and Erin and she hates it when they hang out with me [what can i say i am so popular with the ladies]. No, i grew up with Mallory and yeah i have a lot of girlfriends, I cant date anyone in school [thats a girls {winks}] I am too good of friends with them all. Which kinda sucks but I can deal with it, I have secrets anyway that solve that problem.  * Kammer, he diffinately has some attatchment issues and i am not the only one seeing them. He is either obsessed with me and 'gay' or he is just trying to get in good with me so that he can get in good with Mal or Erin. I dont know.  Its not like its that hard for him to find someone to date. Even though I could prolly get a girl before him [haha].  * Graduations is coming up for our middle school, its going to be fun graduating but I always think about how its going to be hard being at the 'bottom of the food chain' again. I may be the most popular guy in school but thats only because i am easy to get along with. That is all going to change in highschool, i can feel it. I REALLY HOPE AND PRAY that no one will forget who they are and change into something they arent. Like Jennifer. Which brings me to my other issue.  * Jenn, she is just going to keep doing 'pot' and everything and its going to take a toll on her body soon. I know it, she comes to school drowsing sometimes and I talk about it but she just says:  " you ever just think i am tired, Caeleb?"  * Well Jenn, if you didnt do 'pot' so often then I wouldnt have to 'assume'. Oh well, what can i do other than see how it plays out. I told her that if her grades ever start to fall [because she is a very intelligent girl] then I would tell her parents, because I would know then that her brain was being messed with. She said that she would hate me and love me at the same time [haha]. Is that possible? I know what she means, and I could care less if she hated me because I know that I did the right thing. [love you Jenn!]  * Well thats all for tonight, WOW i wrote a lot. Wait until tomorrow [HAHA].   Stay Tuned!   * kd

       * Finally i am ungrounded. I was grounded for a whole freaking month! That is torture!  * Brother got married [June 13, 04] I was the best man. It was fun but now i am sick from being outside in the pollen and being wet from the bachelor party [we played paint ball in the rain and we all got SOKED]. It was really fun though, and it hurt when you got hit! REALLY BAD! Thats the rush i guess.  * Well thats about it, I have to go to an interview for KILWINS to see if i get the job!
