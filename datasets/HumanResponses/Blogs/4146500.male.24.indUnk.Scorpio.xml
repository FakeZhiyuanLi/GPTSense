      I was on MC during the past four days.   No no, I was not sick or anything.  One of the most important lessons that I learned, having experienced first hand the perils of School and Working Life, is that getting sick and getting an MC, are usually mutually exclusive events.  Case in point: I had this terrible case of stomachache when I was in Primary school, but the doctor just blatantly refused to give me an MC.  Knn.  I hope he lose his license or something.  Time jump to four days ago, to an older and wiser me.  I was feeling lazy, plus I was still pissed at having to work the day before, a Sunday, for goodness’ sake.  So I decided to take a little break.  I ended up with two days’ worth of MCs, which is not a bad deal for twenty odd dollars.  In fact, it was such a good deal, I went to the doc again on Wed, and got another two days’ break.   I know that my colleagues would probably have to work their ass off, and some unfortunate dude may even have to cut short his leave because of me, but who cares huh?  Anyway, I’m in such a good mood, I’ll share with you guys some of my finer tactics in getting MCs:  1)  NEVER go to the company doctor .  They’re paid not to give you adequate MCs.  Bastards, all of them.  2)  Sleep as little as possible the night before , preferably under 5 hours.  With this, you can achieve that ‘I-coughed-so-badly-I-couldn’t-sleep-last-night’ kind of look.  3)  Don’t brush your teeth, wash your face, or comb your hair before the visit .  This helps you achieve that haggard look, which complements Tactic #2.  The doc probably wouldn’t appreciate your bad breath, but who gives a damn about him.  He’s earning shitloads of money from you anyway.  4)  Punctuate every sentence with a cough .  This is also a test to see whether if your doc is genuinely concerned about you.  The one true good doc I met actually poured a cup of warm water for me when I did this, and I felt very guilty after that.  For about a few seconds.  5)  INSIST on two day’s worth of MC .  If need be, say something extreme like you really need the rest, if not you’ll cause a fatal accident or something in your workplace.  You’re paying the bugger for goodness’ sake, and risked the wrath of your boss and colleagues just to bum off, so please do some justice to yourself and milk as much out of it as possible.  There you have it!  Lo and behold, the joy of watching your doctor endorsing your MC is simply priceless.   Finally, a word of caution: Don’t be an ass and say you’ve got food poisoning or something when you really don’t, because the doc will probably proceed to stick some apparatus up your ass for traces of shit.  Trust me, it's painful.  Oh, for some unknown reasons, my colleagues refused to acknowledge my hellos this morning.  Bunch of stuck-ups, that’s what they are really.   I hope they get food poisoning.  Love, Eddy Neo

      I was about to indulge in my bottle of Yakult just now, when I noticed something horrible:     MY GOD!! 911!! Could this be a signal by some terrorists?!?!? I’m traumatized.   Anyway, coming back to Yakult… I love that stuff since I was a kid! Not that I could afford it all the time though… my family was really dirt poor. I wonder what makes Japanese stuff so expensive. In fact, the only cheap Japanese thing that I can think of is the Japanese slippers I wear when I go Orchard. And they are actually Made-In-China. Crap. I really should switch to Vitagen, but I hate that overly sweet taste.  The only time I got sick of Yakult (quite literally) was during primary school, when I drank like five bottles of the thing, one after the other. I promptly languished at the school toilet for ages, but let’s not go into details.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I was watching Yi Tian Tu Long Ji last night (okay lah, The Heavenly Sword & The Dragon Sabre), and I was really disgusted because Zhang Wuji is acted by Tommy Su, of all people.  Tommy Su!!! For goodness’ sake, I seriously think he’s a wuss. Anyone still remember Xiao Hu Dui? Hu dei fei ya!  I’m truly traumatized. All my happy memories of watching the earlier version of the show by Tony Leung when I was a kid is now tarnished. I therefore have no idea why I was glued to the TV last night until the show ended. Must be the babes.  Anyway, if you happen to be the boss of some TV station, I seriously think I can be a A-class scriptwriter for period dramas. In fact, here’s one plot in ten simple steps.  1) Hero witnessed his parents getting massacred by Villain when he was a kid. 2) Hero gets pursued by enemies and falls into a ravine. 3) Hero did not die, but instead found a long lost supreme kung fu manual in a cave. 4) Hero did not go insane, despite the fact that he did not have access to proper toilet facilities and aircon. 5) Hero practices the said supreme kung fu, and breaks out of the ravine thanks to his new found skills. 6) Hero, in the mean time, grows up to be a strapping, handsome young man, and falls in love with Sweet Maiden. Sweet Maiden lusts him back too (cue obligatory sex scene). 7) Hero encounters Villain while having char kway teow, and challenges him to a duel. 8) Hero defeats Villain after suddenly comprehending the final secret stroke of his supreme Kung Fu. 9) Hero kills Villain. Bad mistake. Villain turns out to be Sweet Maiden’s long-lost-daddy. 10) Sweet Maiden goes mad with grief. Hero, in remorse, jumps off a ravine.  There you have it! A possible award-winning script, full of lust, revenge and tragedy, just waiting to be discovered. I foresee the show getting terrific viewer-ship, after which I can pen the sequel, the one with Hero’s kid as the new Hero, and old Hero coming back up from the ravine because he is not really dead. Sweet Maiden, in the mean time, recovers from her madness, and does not look a day older even though 16 years have passed.  They’ll pay me so much for my script, I’ll never have to slog at this stupid office on a Sunday ever again.

       Backdated 10 August 2004   Ah Hock got groped yesterday.  It seems that the grand finale for the gay fest was held at Zouk last night, and I guess everyone was just trying to be friendly.  I mean, it was National Day after all.  I tried to cheer Ah Hock up by cracking some good-natured “bending-down-to-pick-the-soap” jokes, but he wasn’t amused.  Ungrateful prick.  Me:  You know, you could have left the place if you didn’t like the atmosphere  AH:  I know… but I die die must finish my two free drinks first what.  Me:  ….  Anyway, I tried my best to rush back home for NDP on TV after finishing my report yesterday, but I only managed to catch the fireworks segment at the end.  I tried my best not to cry when they showed PM Goh leaving the stadium, but I did anyway.  My mummy was very proud of my show of patriotism.  Fortunately, they showed Singapore Idol immediately after NDP, or I’ll still be feeling sad now.  Keke, the show was damn funny….  My fav was the Careless Whisperer!  I love his classic looking specs and his terrific hairstyle, which coincidentally, is similar to what I have.  I thought the judges were just being mean.  Why force him to sing without a mike?!? Every time I see people sing on TV they all have mikes one what… so unfair.  I think they’re just jealous of his hair, that’s why.   I’m very proud of the fact that Jia Jia Liang Teh, my favorite drink, is one of the official sponsors of the show.  Now all those who thought that I behave like an ah pek because I enjoy that drink, will finally realize that I am actually a very cool person after all.  Maybe Suzy, whom I had the longest crush on since secondary one, will give me a call after watching the Jia Jia advert :)  Talking about S'pore Idol, guess who I found on the web just now: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      YES!! IT'S THE BANANA MAN :D!!!!  Keke, you guys should really check out his, er, refrigerator at  urlLink http://www.freewebs.com/saikomelon/allaboutme.htm  .  This guy is freaking funny!  And I must say he has excellent taste in web design, judging from his choice of a predominant green background (what a coincidence!! That's the colour of my blog too :D!)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Xiaxue ranted about some taxi driver in her recent blog entry.  I don’t know about her, but personally, I’m terrified of taxi drivers… there was once when this siao taxi uncle drove like 140km/h on the PIE with me on the backseat.  I was scared shitless.  Indeed, I almost peed in my pants.  I wish he would spare a thought for me, the 24 year old virgin.  Love, Eddy Neo Chee Beng

       Backdated 9 August 2004   I can’t believe that I’m working now. Hello?!?! Today is National Day okay, and I think my boss is unpatriotic because she forced me back for a stupid last minute report. This is so unfair! I really should be lazing around at home watching TV, or doing some cheap shopping in Johore. Come to think of it, she also made me work during the first day of Chinese New Year, as well as Christmas last year.  Damn. I hope Ms Tan will go rot in hell. She’s 35, a spinster, and I think she’s butch because she absolutely hates all the guys in the department, with yours truly as her ‘favorite’. I caught her muttering something about ‘spineless-weakling-who-sits-on-his-brains’ when she was interviewing me for my annual staff appraisal, though I’m not very sure what she means exactly.  I’m feeling doubly miserable because I’m freezing under the aircon, even though I’m having double insulation from my singlet-under-green-polo combo. I’m the only person in the office, and possibly within the entire building, save for the bangla jaga I saw at the reception area downstairs. Shit, my imagination is running wild. What am I gonna do if someone comes and molest me? What if the bangla jaga decides to come up and molest me? What if MS TAN comes and molest me?!?! Shudders….  Anyway Ah Hock was complaining to me how he got harassed at Orchard Road yesterday. It seems that there’s this gay festival going on (goodness! In Singapore!), and he got ogled all over the whole day.   Me: You must be wearing your sleeveless tees again right?  AH: Wah! How did you know? Knn, my muscles are for nice nice char bors to see one ok? Not for those chao ah guas….  Me: But strange leh, I didn’t notice anyone staring at me even though I was at the Taka Kino for the whole day!  AH: That’s because you are fucking ugly.   I don’t know why I’m still friends with Ah Hock.  By the way, I saw this really cool bag from the NDP website! Can anyone please give one to me if they don't want it? It would be so cool if I can bring it to work! I'm really a patriot at heart.      Oh, I read something in the papers yesterday that left me traumatized. Xiaxue was profiled in some write-up about S’porean rebels! I saw that pic of her, and I had to slap myself twice to make sure I was not hallucinating. It’s so unfair! Why didn’t they interview me instead?!?! They would have been so entertained when I tell them about my experiences from my 10 odd years of scouting.  Alright, enough of my rubbish. I have to finish the damn report, or risk facing the wrath of Ms Tan tomorrow. Come to think of it, she probably made me finish the report for her because she’s busy attending the gay festival.  Haha! I’m such a naughty boy :).  HAPPY NATIONAL DAY!  Love, Eddy Neo Chee Beng  PS: Ah Hock just SMSed me to go to Zouk tonight. He must be crazy. I'm a good boy who doesn't cheong.

       Backdated 8 August 2004   I'm gonna come clean with you people why it's been such a long time since my last blog.  The truth is, I now do not have a computer at home.  My mummy caught me wanking to a porn site a few weeks ago, and my trusted old PC has since been transferred to the gleeful hands of the deliriously happy garang guni man.  Damn.  But don't worry!  I've thought of the perfect solution already!  I'm now in the office as I type this, and both my mummy and my boss are blissfully under the mistaken impression that I'm actually doing OT.  Muahahhaa…  I'm such a naughty boy :).  Anyway, I was browsing around in Kinokuniya just now (20% discount! Yippee!), and I'm seriously pissed because I saw like zillions of shu nus with beefcake ah bengs by their sides.  I just don't get it.  Why are women so shallow?!?  They always go for guys with bulging biceps and floppy hair ala F4.  And I noticed that those himbos always wear tight sleeveless tee shirts to show off.  PUI!!!  I hope they catch a cold from the aircon.  Why can't those shu nus like a decent guy like me?  I never leave my shirts untucked, and I always make sure that my hair is neatly combed.  I don't smoke, I don't drink, and I don't even buy 4D!  Ok lah, maybe I visit porn sites a bit too often, but surely that's understandable?  I mean, I'm a 24 year old virgin!  My mummy told me I need to save my precious first time for my shu nu.  When I was growing up, my mummy always tells me that girls like honest guys like me.  I suspect she may be lying because I've never had a girlfriend before.  Haizz… if only some gentle damsel with silky straight hair will look beyond my thick glasses and pimple scarred face….  I can see us living so happily ever after!  Everyday when I come home from work, she will be there smiling sweetly at me, asking me how was my day as she help take my socks off and give me a good massage.  We will then have the wonderful home-cooked dinner she prepared as we watch some silly channel 8 dramas, and after she's done with the dishes, we will have sex.  Life will be so sweet!  But what to do.  Like what Ah Hock (my crude Ah Beng army buddy who happens to have bulging biceps and a penchant for sleeveless tees) said, "Nan Ren Bu Huai, Nu Ren Bu Ai"….  Haizz…. Maybe I really should learn how to be a bad boy, and start wearing sleeveless tees also lah… but then I have skinny arms…. So cham!!!  How?!?!?....  Aiyah, forget it… I'm going back to my fav porn site and see if there're any new materials :).  And damn, Xiaxue's site a few days never update already.  I need something to bitch about!!  Oh!  On a side note, I'm really happy because my Mummy bought me a new green Crocodile polo shirt (complete with stripes!) yesterday!  Keke, finally have something new to wear to work liao :)  Love, Eddy Neo Chee Beng :)

      Lately, I've been really caught up with Xiaxue's blogs. Damn... out of pure bo liao-ness, I've actually wrote my own spoof of how I feel Eccentric Eddy's Blog should be like.  So that's it! Henceforth, all my entries will be a spoof of the hatesite, which really is a spoof of the original XX's blogs (am I the only guy getting confused here?). I have nothing much to write about my life really. It's boring.

      My flu is gone.  But my cough worsened.  Holy crap!!!!  I refuse to see the doctor because, afterall, I'm really a cheapskate at heart.  Why waste $20 odd bucks on a 5 minute visit and some stupid cough mixture, when you can get the same shit from your friendly pharmacy for a fraction of that price?  Ok ok, because the doc can probably give me a proper diagnosis, but hey, I'm not having cancer or something (I hope).  I bet the 3 docs at my area is pissed with me.  Yes, there's THREE clinics within a 200m radius (I'm using pure agaration here) from where I live.  I don't see a single ATM.  I don't see a single newspaper stand.  I didn't even have a nearby provision shop until a few weeks ago.  And yet here they are, all three clinics happily waiting for me to succumb to my cough.  Damn.  Where the hell did they get so much money to open a clinic anyway?!?  Hell, if I've got a long-lost dying auntie who wills her mama shop to me, I'll be freaking happy already.  Ok, the clinics do have one damn good use:  they can issue MCs.  Trust me, without that power most clinics would have folded already.  That's why you'll never be able to buy MCs off the shelf like your cough syrup.  The country wouldn't know what to do with jobless docs.  Maybe we'll just have to deport them to Japan to act in some cosplay porn.  I mean, they've got the uniforms already :)  Muahahahhah... don't worry docs, I still love you all, especially the time when I was down with chicken chop poisoning.  You have to forgive me.  I'm having a cough now and I'm delirious from too much cough syrups.

      I'm feeling miserable.  I'm having a bad bout of flu, along with it a terrible cough, and my back feels funny.  I've not received any new mails from my Boon Lay Girl, and it's just horrible because she's like thousands of miles away in Germany, while I'm left sulking back here in Sembawang... so sad!!  Maybe I shouldn't be so grouchy... I mean, it's friday and I've got the whole day free!! No lessons, no assignments to rush, and I've got a long weekend ahead of me because it's gonna be National Day come Monday.  Haha... I think I'm lazing around too much, that's why I got the damn flu.  No wait, it's not the laziness... its the damn aircon.  Ok, I shall NOT wear Ts and berms to school on Tuesdays ever again.  Two hours of Stats followed by another three in that freezing Finance seminar is too much for my weak bod :P....  Problem is i feel so much more comfortable in berms (when I'm not in the aircon that is)!  It's not as tight as jeans, got more pockets to keep all my rubbish in, and most importantly, it's easier to remove them when i go pee or shit.  Haizzzz.....  Anyway, the reason why I created this blogger account, is because I can't leave a comment on Xiaxue's blog site if I'm not a member.  Don't know who Xiaxue is?  Haha, search for her in Blogger, and be prepared to have a great time :)  I only discovered it like a few days ago, and I proceeded to read every single one of her entries dated from April '03 till now... I think she's freaking funny :D!!  Keke, I wonder what Boon Lay Girl will say if she knows this :P....  And since I've created the account, I thought I might as well leave some words in my blog.  Haha, I'll probably get sick of doing it some time tomorrow, but who cares ;)  Anyway, I've got bad experiences with diaries.  I first started mine like 10 years ago when I was in Sec 2 (when I was 14, for the uninitiated), and promptly discarded it when i reached Sec 3 because I couldn't stand the mushy rubbish I wrote about some crush I had.  It made me cringe.  But I think I must have really enjoyed writing such mushy rubbish because I started again when I was in Sec 4.  Or maybe, that's because I had another crush then, whatever....  Again, I discarded that second diary around 3 years later.  This time, it was because that particular diary made me feel kinda sad when I read through the past entries.  I don't like to dwell on sad events.  Plus, I got so many terrible secrets in that thing, it's just gonna be a disaster if it fell into the wrong hands.  Like what happened to my sister's when i peeked on hers (keke....).  Anyway, here's a self-into, taken directly from my Friendster site:   A perpetual dreamer with the uncanny ability to make my friends laugh... at myself :D!! They think my life's a joke!! Heehee... can't really argue with that sometimes ;)....       Anyway, just surfing thru a few profiles here have made me realise just how OLD-SCHOOL i am :P.... I no longer have any interest in clubbing, and i think beach volleyball is a crappy waste of time for wannabes (kidding :D!)... and who else would list XIANGQI, of all things, as one of his interests in life?!?!? Darn I feel like an ah-pek... keke, quarter life crisis ;)       I can't cycle, can't blade, and never did managed to 'serve' that stupid badminton thingy in my entire life. I enjoy indulging in nostalgic stuff from the lost '80s, attempting in vain to make up for my deprived childhood ;) Sheese... you really have to ask my girl girl what she sees in me :D!       Oh, and my fav food is pork chops... Yum Yum :P..!! Come to think of it, also rojak (toa payoh kopitiam version). And char kway teow. Not forgetting french fries dipped in hot melted cheese. Er... a lot of 'favorites' lah!   Ok ok, I know it's kind of crappy and corny, but nevermind ;)
