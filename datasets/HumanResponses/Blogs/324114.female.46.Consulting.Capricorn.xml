      Well, the angel won. I went to work today....after alot of internal struggle with the facts. I calculated sick days left this year, vacation days available and figured that I have alot of better opportunities to use my sick days. Plus, not selling for a few days gave me a case of the guilts. Like how am I gonna make any cash if  I'm sitting on my ass at home? So, out the door I went, and yes, a decent sale did come along for me, about 5 minutes before closing time. Cha ching $$$$! Hopefully, after a couple days of vegging out here at home, I'll be ready to kick some major  retail ass on Wednesday. Life is still good! Oh yeah.

      I am sooooooo proud of my son and his friends. *rolls eyes towards ceiling and grins* See, I get a call around 11pm from my sons girlfriend saying, "Come to Perkins and bring your camera!" I tear off thinking I'm gonna meet a movie star or something along those lines!  I get to Perkins restaurant to observe, (and photograph), this huge mountain they (6 of them) had built, out of over 2,400 creamer cups! College town entertainment at it's finest. Perkins was nice enuff to give them all free drinks for accomplishing this fete......and entertaining their customers for an hour and 1/2. Gotta love teenagers! *rolling eyes towards ceiling again*

      I have a little problem. See, I haven't sold a damn thing at work for three freakin' days now. We work on comission, so indeed this is not making me a happy girl. I fact, I'm a really pissed off  chick right now.  Back to my problem. I planned on blowing tomorrow off, using a sick day, and making a nice three day retreat for myself. I feel I deserve it......the scum suckers I work with do this shit all the time! Not me....the nice girl. The thing is, since I've had such a lousy sales streak, do I buck up, go in and try to make some moolah....or do I take the day off and get a much needed mental vacation? Guilt is kicking in here. Damn. the angel on one shoulder says, "go in and give it another shot...tomorrow might be your lucky day. Strap on some balls lady."(Now I doubt that actual angels use the word "balls" in their vocabulary, who knows)  Then the little devil on the other shoulder is saying, " Call off and stay home and regroup.Your job sucks and you need some time to chill. Strap on a set of balls lady!"  Both are valid, and tempting. I dunno.I'll probably call in sick. Just making the decision is making me ill. Geeeeez.

      Saw this while surfing sites today.......Stuffed, yellow duck looking for people to have him as a house guest for a couple of days, during his  urlLink world tour ! Keep him for a few days, take him around town and snap a few photos (digital) then send him on to his next host family! Cute idea!

I did see you out naked the other nite......LOL  you really should put sompfin on that ass when you hook the dog out!!  Well guess by now you are pissed and will come knocking on my door.....hope so the coffee is always on for you. Hitting the hay now.. nitey nite Dear.

      Sometimes I wish my life was more exciting. And other times, I'm really happy that it's comfy and predictable. I would make a very good Gemini. Glad I'm not one though, as I live with one and they are freakin' nuts! Like two nuts in one. Anyway, as I was making my way to Wal Mart tonight, I started thinking how simple and kinda mundane my everyday happenings are. I live in a very quiet area, in a little cottage by a lake. I go to work each day, always arrive on time, never break the rules, put in my hours and head straight home afterwards. On my days off, I clean the house and try to cook a couple of decent meals. In my free time, I'm working on my sites, reading or gardening. Napping and daydreaming....ya, I do alot of those too. I try to always put my hubby and son before anything else. I have one best friend...she lives on the other side of the trees. Really, she does. Most of the time, I just love this way of life.......slow and easy. Predictable. Cozy. But at other times, I long for the excitement of a time long ago. Living on the edge, in the fast lane. I was a blurr. Constant motion, never knowing where fate wouild take me. The funny part of it is, when I was in that place, I kinda longed to be right where I am now. Could this be a mid-life crisis? I don't think so. Just a mid-life reflection. It's kinda fun to think about the wild and crazy times....no responsibilities, just freedom. But to be honest, I wouldn't go back there for anything. I love my cozy, comfy place. Predictable as it is.

      I'm a bit pissed right now.......at myself. Why, oh why don't I ever learn? I don't know didly shit about coding, I just dabble. I must admit I've been learning alot along the way, but by no means am I even close to knowing even a fraction of what others know. I know enuff to get me by, and that's fine for now. Here's what pisses me off though. I never know when to leave stuff alone.

      Because all of us here deal with the general public on a daily basis at our jobs, we all know that there are some real loonies out there.  So I had to share  urlLink this link , which further proves that fact.  (Pretty entertaining.)

      I barely get done posting that I need to go on a major diet, and what do I do? Decide to make major comfort foods for dinner. Stuffed peppers, mashed potatoes and green beans. I'm doomed to fat-assdom. I am sooooo weak!

      I need to go on a diet  big time . The job I'm at now is making me fat.....all we do is munch all day long. Boredom I guess. Then there's the acess to all the fast food places, that you can hit with a rock from where I work.  shit. My house is also filled with goodies able crush any willpower I may have. I need to move to freakin Siberia to lose any weight around here. And to make matters even worse...I hate to work out. I'd like to get in shape by Spring, as I feel that's a realistic time frame. Now all I need is the motivation. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

      I think that it is in my best interest to post before Karma kicks my butt (in more ways than one).  I believe I must be the one "up the tree" so to speak, as Karma must be to the "right" of the trees and Tricia to the "left".  Aw hell, I guess I'll just make a nest up here in the branches and be comfortable, ha ha.  This is my first post here, and I'm drawing a bit of a blank at the moment as to what to write (probably has to do something with my long day).  I want to thank Karma for inviting me to post here, I find it very flattering.  I guess what I might be able to offer (for better or worse) is a younger point of view - though I think my comrades here are just as young as me, in heart!  I can't promise I'll always be entertaining or insightful, but I'll do my best.  More to come later - after I get some sleep and can think strait!  Night all!

      I'm having alot of trouble blogging tonight, as I think I'm suffering from "brain block". Not simply writers block, as my whole mind seems to be jammed up. It just doesn't want to put together thoughts in any manner that will make alot of sense. In fact, it just doesn't wanna think....period. The fact that I'm writing this is a miracle in itself. I think I'm just dead tired. I hope so. Either that, or I've just become a dumbass.

      Today was Monday.......and after a 4 hour nap I think I am past my Saturday nite party....which is the subject I guess of this rant.  Ok I dont drink that often, and now I understand why. I have lost two days just recovering...It was a going away party for my boss. Of course it had to be the boss I liked. So that leaves me to face a perv boss and an asshole boss. Think I will take the perv over the asshole. Guess it's like anyone... we all have that asshole to deal with. I suppose its good to i.d. him right up front but damn.. why doesnt he realize what an asshole he is and make all our lives a bit nicer. At least he was smart enough not to join the party. Kudos to my asshole boss. So now the last purpose of my entry tonight.. the group of us leave the party to go to another bar.. not sloppy drunk.......yet.  So 15 of us walk in .. all white or mostly white.. with two black girls.. This bar had the gall to not serve the blacks l was with......I thought it was the year 2001........l am like what the fuck?  So I am telling all l know, not to go to this redneck, not even funny bar. I hope they go down the tubes fast as shit. Can l be sued for slander if I post their name? Last thing l want is to give them more advertising. Call me Karma and I will tell you where to avoid.  Well guess l need another nap to recover some more.......shit it's a bitch getting old.  Nap hell.....l am going to bed! Nite all.......sweet dreams till sunbeams find you....

      What a glorious day today was! The sun was out all day and the temp. was in the mid 70's....a perfect day for daydreaming and being lazy-minded. The leaves are slowly turning autumn colors, and a few are starting to fall here and there. I really love this time of year. I realized today, that I really need to get back to reading again. I love to read all sorts of books, but I seem to slack off during the warm months, and resume again around this time of year. I really am a creature of habit, I guess! I joined a great bookclub about two years ago, called  One Spirit Book Club. Their books are all newage reads...from yoga and meditation to herbal remedies and dream books. Anyway, I have alot of catching up to do, as I have a few books that I haven't even cracked open yet. Time to make some steaming orange spice tea, (with a bit of honey!), grab the cozy blanket and curl up on the sofa for a bit. Sounds good to me.

      I layed downf or a bit after dinner, as I could not seem to shake the headache I had brought home from work. I fell into a deep, deep sleep, and had some really crazy dreams I'll tell ya! I don't dream that often (at least that I'm aware of), so when I do, I really enjoy them as they unfold. Unfortunately, I was startled awake and kinda bummed that I had exited from my dreamland adventure. I wanted to go back so badly. Did that ever happen to you? You awake from a dream and try to hurry back to resume where you left off? Never works for me. I hate that.

      OK......OK.........she begged me enough... so here it is. My entry.......now I have to think.. and hey.....thats not my style. Oh shit.. forgot I don't have a style either. I was telling Karma tonight that I had to deal with John Q Public again today. A word to the wise.. when inquiring over the phone about an order you have made...you don't know what "race" your talking about so don't slam a whole race. Remember I am in control of your order!! I believe John Q is going to get her order sometime after christmas. Lifes little victories... sometimes can't be celebrated but the silent revenge is sometimes best of all.... oh yeah... she is waiting for it to arrive Monday.... so much for closing the  boarders to the likes of me! LOL  Well that was my rant on the races today.. I think I need to hit the hay now.... Siesta time! LOL  later everyone.

      I had a bit of fun tonight. At least it was fun while it lasted. I visited the chat area over at  urlLink surreally  to say say Hi (seeing as I'm a "new kid on the block"!) and kinda introduce myself. Thought it would be fun to chat with the people behind a site that I really enjoy. Anyway, it was fun until I got transported to this black "void" and didn't know how in the hell to get back!  I finally got back to the chat somehow...only to lose contact again. I don't know if it's my PC or what. It's probably me hitting the wrong button (not hard to do as there are many). I just need to figure out a plan to get out of the "void". Or how to avoid the "void". Nice people over there indeed. You just need a version for clutzes like me!

      Today was an emotionally draining day at work....and it didn't involve the attack in any way at all. I must have a look that compels people to tell me all their problems, anytime...anywhere. Like in the mattress department, today at work. I was helping a sweet, timid woman purchase a bed and a mattress, when the next thing I knew the conversation turned from a delivery date, to how she was abused by a guy in California, she fled with her kids and dog across the country, only  to have her kids and dog taken away, because someone  thought she was emotionally unfit to keep them. She has tried to commit suicide twice....the last time a few weeks ago. She's trying to pick up the pieces of her life, one day at a time with the help of local womens groups, etc. God she sat there and cried and thanked me for listening to her. How could I not listen to her story? The poor thing lives in fear, as the ass who hurt her is looking for her.(she even showed me her protection order.) I gave her a big hug as she left,(I've given alot of hugs too)  and told her that she is strong, and a great person, and to stop in and see me anytime, if only to chat a bit. I went outside after she left, puffed on a cig and just shook. I felt her pain in every word she said. I felt them to the core of my being. I was happy to see, that when she left, she at least had a bit of a smile on her face...happy with the purchase she just made for herself......and maybe a bit more hopeful that things are going to be ok. The sales lady said so.

      I was up waaaaay too late again. I believe it was almost 3 am when I finally headed to bed........not good, considering I have to work today. Web logs and blogging have turned me into an insomniac indeed! I'm addicted. Hell, I get home from work and I don't even change my clothes....say 'Hi" to the family, then check the sites. I'm sure there are therapy groups for this disorder.On another note, I'm kinda excited, as I have invited another friend to join my Trees group. I think she will add a fresh outlook on things, as she is quite a bit younger than Tricia and I, and I think it will be fun to have her musings here with us....er should I say, me? I hope she will be sending us a post here any day. Well, gotta head off to the "Grind" for another fun filled day with the co-workers that I lovingly call the "clowns". Adios!

       New meaning to "TV Land" Oh where, oh where has Tricia gone? Did she get sucked into the T.V. like in Poltergeist??? I dunno. All I do know is, if that's the case, it's going to be really akward taking a 27" T.V. to the chinese buffet with me on our "girls day out". *rolls eyes* Geeeez.

      I  put all the energy that I've been building up over the past few days to good use today....I cleaned like mad!  I've put off doing alot of basic maintence this past week, (uh, maybe even two weeks) so  today all hell broke loose on the domestic front. I feel so much better now that things are a bit neater. Not spotless by any means, but comfortably tidy. Martha Stewart wouldn't be impressed, but we all know I can't stand her anyway.

      Well I'm back from a little " mental vacation ",and my head seems to be a bit clearer now. I needed time to just let this all sink in and try to sort it out in some way. It got to the point where I just couldn't read about it, listen to it or even discuss it any more. So I tried to find a quiet place each day, ( through a bit of meditation), and I cleared my mind and calmed my soul. I couldn't even sit down to blog, as all my words led, in one regard or another, to Tuesdays attack. There's nothing I could say, that hadn't already been said in a thousand different ways. Different people, different places, different pages....so different, yet all the same. Today I felt peaceful amidst the confusion. My thoughts turning toward more mundane, everyday kinda things...a welcome diversion indeed. I feel the need to funnel all my energy into showing extra care and concern to all the people in my life. No matter what the context. Perhaps I've started my own type of rescue effort, in my own little corner of the world, with what I have the power to affect and change...now. I've changed how I love, how I forgive, how I listen, and how I live. I know I can't change the whole world, but I can have a positive effect on those I see everyday.

       Let's get busy!  I know that in speaking for myself, (and I'm sure others as well), over the past couple of days, I have run the gambit of emotions. From shock and terror....disbelief and fear....anger then numbness. Now I'm at the point where I want to do something...something that will help make a difference for someone. Now, I'm in no way a rich person, but that doesn't matter here, because even small gestures, done by millions, can produce tremendous results! So there are lots of ways that we can rally together and help those that need us. I've included a link in our side-bar for donations to the Red Cross. All donations (100%) will go to disaster relief. Contact your church or local city agency. Alot of them are collecting not only cash donations, but other items that are needed by the rescue people and/ or victims families. Giving blood is a great idea, although alot of blood banks are saying that they have enough right now, so it might pay to wait a few days. Give the blood bank a call....they'll tell you their status. And send up a prayer....for those lost, for those hanging on to life, for those waiting, for those grieving, for the rescuers, for our Armed Services, for our Leaders, for our planet, for all of us. Peace.

      I have been reading the posts of fellow bloggers over the past couple of days, and I must say, that amidst all the grief, pain, disbelief,  feelings and views being expressed, it is awe inspiring to see everyones true spirit of community, rising as one, united in helping eachother deal with, and hopefully get through this terrible tragedy. From shore to shore, border to border and across the world, we feel the same pain, a shared pain, regardless of color, sex, religion, status, age. And we want to reach our hands, and hearts out to our Brothers and Sisters...be it by a glance to a passing stranger that says "I feel the same way too", or a shoulder to cry on, or a message in a strangers comment box that says "I'm sorry, my thoughts and prayers are with you", or giving blood...the list is endless. For a few days now, we have put our personal needs aside, and we are looking at the needs of our fellow  American Brothers and Sisters.........we need to carry on this crusade long into the future. For us and for future generations. It's very sad that it took an event of this magnitude to bring us all together as one....one heart, one mind, one spirit, one goal....united and powerful. I am proud to be an American, and I am proud of  all the citizens out there everywhere , pulling together as one,  during this devastating time in our history. Together we are strong. United we stand.....divided is not an option.

      In the next few weeks things will be a bit out of control emotionally.. When opening my mail yesterday 9/11/01 I find this letter from a self help author whom I highly respect and feel it may be of some help....please read and share with your friends...and enemies alike...   When a catastrophic event like this happens, powerful feelings may arise. So I offer this: Don't give any more power to a small group of people almost certainly zealots of some kind whose twisted psyches (along with self-sacrificial devotion to their dark illusions).If this had been a tornado or earthquake, it would have represented a magic blip in nature's enigmatic scheme. But this was personal; human  beings did this deliberately to other human beings. And some of us are reacting exactly as they wished -- to bring the entire country to a halt, and to create waves of paralysis much farther-reaching than the localized damage caused, generating reactive shockwaves all over our country (and the world).   This catastrophic series of events remind us that while we cannot control circumstances in the world or in our personal lives, we can choose how we will respond. None of us can (or should) stop or control our natural emotional reactions, but we can help thwart their nefarious intent by controlling our behavior -- by responding in our circle of friends with compassion and calm. These people can only succeed in bringing our lives to a halt with our cooperation. Let's not give them power over our psyches; let's not serve their goals. Let's remember to breathe deeply, to relax our bodies, and to focus on the present moment, doing what needs to be done.Historically, this attack may rank with Pearl Harbor -- and when our country is roused, it becomes a giant, and some kind of justice will prevail. What form that "justice" may take is difficult to predict. One thing is certain; out of every adversity or challenge comes new lessons  and growth.  In the coming days and weeks, this event will become a topic of intense conversation (and action in appropriate quarters); the dead will be buried and grieved; the injured cared for; the FBI, CIA and other military activated. You and I will go on with our lives.Let's pray for those who need it; let's accept our emotions without letting them disable our clarity; let's keep our hearts open, even to the waves  of pain; and let's resolve to do what we can, in our own humble ways, to help create a world of understanding, compassion, courage, and love -- beginning with ourselves.

I'm too tired to try to fix it tonight....I will try to get it on track tomorrow. Maybe an exorcism is in order. This place has been acting totally whack lately. Did we move into a haunted blog? I knew we shouldn't have been messing around with that damn Oiji board. Happens every time.

Don't go "browsing" with your debit card in purse.                                                        Don't go out of the building during lunch-hour!

       Off the wall This post is not going to be entertaining, enlightening, comical or any of that other happy bullshit. No. No way, nada, no how, by no fuckin' means. I'm a tad bit ruffled and I just feel the need to all out vent....just for a bit (so bear with me).  Screw that...I'm totally pissed and I want to let it out here, cause this place is the cause of my attitude malfunction. Not only has it taken me forever to get to this friggin' place...when did get in...all royal hell breaks loose! *lights another cig* ( I think I smoked a pack just trying to get to my blog, for cryin' out loud!) Anyway, no matter what I've tried to do, some cyber fuck-up decides that it isn't meant to be. Now I fully realize that this is not qualified as a literary 911 emergency....like I need to post the final procedure in a brain surgery operation to a surgeon with sporatic memory loss. No fuckin' shit!  But damnit I should be able to sit down and knock off a few sentences in a shorter time than it took to give birth to my son. Well, all the bugs (or whatever) are still not worked out yet....like why all my fonts keep changing  here. Hell, that's a whole nuther' bitch fest in itself. Well, I do feel a bit better now...thanks for bearing with me.....maybe tomorrow I'll have better luck. If not.....you'll know!

         Freedom Week     It seems I am to receive a week without the big kid here. So I don't know if I will be posting.......it means I get to use the big T.V. all by myself. Now I realize men don't think a woman can handle a remote of that magnitude but being the adventurous one I am going to try it out. See why it has to flip through all the stations at each commercial. I am amazed the the manufacturers have not come out yet with a remote that can stay on the same station for more than 5 minutes. Hey, maybe I will invent it and become rich!! Yee Haa.. my ship has come in! Too bad I am at the airport....yeah I know old joke. What can I say.. having got up early on my day off it seems very late and I cannot be held responsible for bad humor. Another reason its nice to have the big kid gone... I can sleep in tomorrow..my last day off. It is beyond me why we even have to leave the comfort of our beds on our day offs.  If it were up to me I would have a little frig for my nite table and then I wouldn't have to get up all day. Hmmm I know there has to be another invention in there somewhere. Like a headboard that would open to reveal a frig full of snacks. What good is a headboard anyway? Not like you can lay your head on it.....course I guess you have to have someplace to tie the ropes to. LOL.... see you all later. Nite

       Down and Out!  Well it seems we lost our comment  link for awhile, and it totally drove me buggy as to what the problem was. Let it hereby be known, that I am in no way, shape or form, a computer genius! In fact I'm not a genius at all....in any realm...what-so-ever. Shit, I've diverted from the main topic here (I do this alot!) Anyway, I finally found out that Reblogger was down for a bit, and all I had to do was change the coding in my template, and all would be well again in "comment land".  I did get the comment links up again, but I lost all the freakin' comments.  *frown* Hopefully this won't happen again any time soon. I didn't post anything yesterday, as I was totally burned out after work. So I basically crashed out before 11. No urge to speak, listen, type, think. Sleep was my salvation.....blissful zzzzzzzzzzzz's

         Payday Friday!   Sometimes its all you can do to drag your ass out of that warm bed and get ready for work. Some days you roll over .. take a look.. and jump out of bed. Quick shower, throw on some clothes and off to work. I know it drives the men nuts to see us put makeup on in the car so I have begun to make a habit of it.. and on some mornings can even manage a cell call while doing it....driving? oh yeah I can keep it near my lane too. This morning promised to be a long day.. so thinking fast I put on jeans and sneakers.. a no no at work.. hoping to be able to pick up my paycheck and be sent home for inproper attire.....well shit guess what day it was....come to work casual......figures dont it? On my way I stop and pick up the same guy everyday.. he's pretty cool usually. Today he comes out in his boxers and says he will be ready in a few. I sit and wait....for a man.. whats wrong with me anyway. He hops in the car singing Bob Dillon....well ok sure it will stop in a few.................................hundred miles!!! I let him go only cause he was drunk and having a hell of a time.. started rubbing off and i begun to feel better .. or perhaps I was nearing intoxication on the fumes. Whatever the case .. the man, myself and bob dillion survived the day. Paycheck..........dont make me laugh... its only 9:30pm and its already gone..... have to wait another two weeks now.......or maybe the government will send me another check to help them with inflation.

       Holding out on me?!!       Hey Karma you didn't tell me you were planning a sea side retreat... always more fun if you bring along another couple.. and you know how well  the boys get along together!!  I am wondering if it would appear suspicious to pack a black dress? Oh hell if I wait we can go on shopping spree together...now theres the ticket!  Look out folks we are in morning and mean to snap ourselves out of it if it takes all day.   Now thats taken care of I am taking my turn to vent on J.D. Public.... being in customer service as I am.....LOL.....shiit its more like being the company scape goat.. anyway, I come into contact with the most "unusual" people I have ever met. Why is it on the phone you (Mr. J.D. Public) feel you can rip a person to shreds because of some screw up you made? I can't help it if you can't stop your spending habits. Shit I know that if I spend $3,000.00 on an item.. I will save the receipt.. and I will remember who I owe my ass to. You call me and say you need to send a payment to a bank thats three months overdue but you don't know which bank....you don't know your damn phone number... worse was the man that said "right now, I am at a different pay phone, I don't remember the other payphones number". Then he had the gull to yell at me? I think not. It was indeed too bad I develope sneezes and disconnect each and everyone of you jerks. Want to call and bitch me out.....stand in line.. but don't worry .. it shouldn't take too long to disconnect the calls. Ever hear that...please stay on the line.. your call is important to us.........LOL think again.

       Can't get enuff.... Wow! I am really amazed. I was out surfing today, and my eyes were truely opened to the wide variety of really remarkable web-sites that are out there, just waiting to be enjoyed by all. I know most of you are probably already aware of this phenomenon, but I, being rather new to all this, had NO idea!  Speaking of wonderful sites, I'd like to thank  urlLink surreally dot com  for their link to us, and the mention of us on their page! Their site is always fun and interesting, and I really enjoy the interaction between all the writers there. Also, their layout is nicely done and very easy on the eye.  Stop in and pay them a visit! And while you're there, check out some of the links on their site. You're in for a fantastic journey! Lata.

       D(m)ental Abuse???  Went to the friggin' dentist this morning........go in to have a cap glued back in. Now I feel like I need a damn therapist! Let's start off by saying that I'm about as far away from a morning person as you can get. Personally, I find those perky mornin' people obnoxious, and I pretty much just wanna bitch-slap em' when they get around me with their happy morning bullshit. Mornings suck here in La La Land......Nuff said 'bout that. So I guzzle my coffee and head out, thinking this should be an in and out kinda thing. WRONG! I get in the chair, and my dentist comes in and says, "By the way, I'm not practicing anymore. Meet Dr. Bla Bla (I wasn't comprehending all this), he'll be taking over for me." Well, okay I guess....like what am I gonna say? Not like they asked my opinion on the whole matter! So on we go.....oh, oh.....looks like decay there too. Shit. Well, to make a long story bearable, drill, shot, more drilling, glue, bondo, more drill, head left, up, down, rinse & spit. All done? Hell no!  ...Another little cavity, lets fix that now. Hell, lets just wrack up the old platinum card...in fact, let's just make a whole day of it...I'll spring for lunch asshole! So we fix the cavity and they set me free. Well, can't go yet...the finance witch grabs ahold of me, and hits me with the damage to my pocketbook. It's a shame I have to tell hubby that he'll be living at the dentists house as a man-servent....bartering is the way to go I'll tell ya!  Well, I go out into the world broke,drooling and babbling (novicane in full force!) and praying to God that my hubby doesn't object to what I've packed for him for his trip. He did say for better or worse. If I don't post for a few days......hubby didn't find this amusing. Check garden....hint, hint. Lol!

       Am I missing something??  I don't know if I'm the only one wondering this, but............why do these people keep going into the water, when so many are being attacked by sharks???!!!  Especially your kids. I mean, I can see sending the old man out there to test the water...."yeah, go ahead honey.....waters fine!  I'll be right out!" Oops...where'd he go?? Anyway, what are these folks thinking? Last thing I'd wanna be doing is sending little Bobby out on a boogie board. Did ya ever hear of a pool? Cool off and still keep yur limbs...what a concept! Hey, I just thought of an crazy idea. Instead of a divorce....how 'bout a lovely weekend trip for two to Florida? Only one return ticket needed. Twisted, but good! C'mon, it's late.....gimmee a break!

Good therapy though.....it's been awhile since I've envisioned placing my hands around my bosses necks or wished I could ram that asshole driving in front of me on my daily commute to the "Grind." See...blogging can save lives. Or at least keep you out of sharing a cell with a guy named "Bubba". Or Vivian. Whatever.

Sliding to a screatching hault in front of the keyboard... cigarette ash dropping on the monitor... blowing hard so that all ash is in the rear.. as all ashes should be.  Ok serious now I have at last found the site.. now to put my talent to work.......lol, looks like unemployment again!!! Really Karma the least you could have done was unpack spell check for me. You better than anyone should know I spend my time primping instead of learning the basics in grammer. So you all better get used to the spelling and the grammer... Hell thats one way to tell Karma and I apart...shes the prim and proper one.. I am the one with orange and blue hair...not really planned but a kick all the same...Better see if I can get this posted before Karma as a blow out looking for me.  By the way.... not to worry she wouldn't have paid AOHELL anyway!

Wonder if she's in cyber-limbo somewhere? Should I look? Nah. She's a big girl. I'll give her another day or two. The site looks a bit, shall we say, bland, at the moment.  Gonna add some bells and whistles as soon as we figure out what we wanna do with this place. Since we just "moved in" a couple of days ago, we're still in the process of un-packing....haven't had time to decorate yet!

       Meet The New Neighbors! Well, oh well. Where to begin? So little to say...so much brain dysfunction. I hope you know I'm kidding here! I guess introductions would ba a good place to start . I'm Karma...1/2 of the hormonally challenged duo that will be writing here. Perhaps, in time, we'll add a few other mentally interesting people to the crew....but for now, I think we're all you're gonna need. I'm just your everyday kinda gal, living one day at a time in my own little world, that I lovingly call "La-La Land".  I don't break the rules...I just kinda bend em a bit...It's all good! I'm not famous, or popular. I don't make a ton of moola, although I act like I do. I love my family, close friends, my pets and all of nature. I'm a very artistic, (not autistic!) ,although I really haven't found a medium to best express my talents. Yet. I'm a bit middle-aged....but my spirit doesn't know this and I hope it never will!  Anyway...I hope to share my daily musings here, good and bad....wisdom or just plain ole crapola! My life isn't glamorous....but it sure as hell aint' boring. You'll see!  Till whenever........

      Goodmorning, and Happy Halloween... little Ghouls and Gobblins. Today is your day to party, so dress up and party on! Or if you're just plain freaky as you are, don't dress up....just party down!! I still don't know what I'm gonna do tonight. It's raining out and damn cold.....I really don't fancy standing out there tonight freezing my ass off in my ghoul get-up. Not that I haven't in the past...been through rain, wind, even snow. We'll see....this has happened to me before. All day I'm dragging my feet about dressin up, then I change my mind, fly like a bat outta hell, get ready, and have a blast!  Maybe I'll dig out my cape and stuff and see what happens. Dunno. The cool thing is that most people fix their places up kinda "cutsey", but I'm one of the few that scares em' a bit and the kids get a kick out of it. So do the parents, really. Guess I'll go dig out my costume. Maybe that will inspire me to bring out my "dark side" once again this year. So maybe if you're out and about tonight, and you hear the leaves rustling behind you, and you feel something staring at your back from out of the shadows, and you catcha glimps of a dark figure lurking about in the cold, dark nightness...don't be too afraid. It may just be me, with my plastic pumpkin filled with Reeses cups. Then again, it may not. Happy haunting!

      OK joking out of the way.. I am back.. and hope after this weekend i will recover from the jet lag... or is it just too much party? Hmmm both i guess.  I am suppose to go out tomorrow nite to a party.....arghhhhhh....they are trying to kill me i think. Anyway my trip to the midwest was an enlightening experience. I always pictured sort of quiet backward farm people living there....My apology to each and every mid westerner. I would love to move there .........correction........I long for the time i can move there. The people there are so kind and nice. I am a yankee and talk too fast for them but hell i think i can drop the new york minute.. i hate rushing anyway. I worked 70 hours and partied just as many if not more....it was a chance for me to catch up on seven years of naught. LOL......it was fun... Karma you and I have to go on a road trip!!!  I did get lost out there easily.. without the lake to help me judge which way is north i was easily lost. I visited Iowa on a regular basis...LOL. Council Bluffs i believe. They treated my like a lady... .. almost forgot i was one. I am sorry that you had to fly solo here for awhile but i will try to do better hon..... i will tell you about the corn maze tomorrow!!! Don't go in to the corn!!!!

      There's something about this time of year, that seems to bring out the "darker" side of my personality. I have always been a night person...I love the darkness, the moon and stars, things that lurk in the shadows. And needless to say, this time of year plays right into my love of the dark and mysterious. Cloudy, breezy nights. A chill in the air, and the moon casting shadows under the black, leafless trees. Kind of mysterious and spooky..............I love it. Daytime just doesn't have the same draw for me. I love my nights. Part of me leans towards the dark side. Not too far though. Just to the edge. Went over the edge, long, long ago. I'll never go there again. Ever. Even though I'm a bright, sunny kinda person...ever the optimist...part of me will always be drawn to the darkness. This time of year just brings it to light.

      It was a gorgeous fall day today, made even better by the fact that I'm on vacation. Love it! I slept in this morning till 11, and really did nothing worth while all day, except take our down comforter to the laundromat. Strange thing pertaining to doing laundry. I don't know about you, but stuff always disappears outta the dryer. I know this doesn't happen to me alone, as I have read about others experiencing the same shit. Well I'll be damned! It happens in the freakin' laundromat too! I put two tennis balls in the dryer with my comforter, (they beat the down while it dryes to fluff it), and only one came out!!!  WTF???? Now how the hell do you loose a tennis ball in a dryer?? Leave it to me. Enter my world....shit like this happens. One would think I'd be used to it by now.

      Well, as of today, I'm steering clear of fast food establishments. It's not that I don't love fast food, casuse I do. But some cosmic influences are causing me to have bad experiences, almost every time I try to get a freakin order of fries or a burger. Consider my experiences in the past....go to Arbys, order roast beef sandwhich with horsey sauce on the side. Pay and pick up order, pull away approx. 15 feet or so to check bag. I discover that there's no sauce in bag and decide to back up to the window to ask for sauce. Backing up was my first major mistake. While watching the big yellow cement pillar hickeys in my rear view, I slam into the friggin metal counter with a loud crash, taking out my left tail light. Holy shit! Well like a good person, I glance into the window, nobody there.....bolt like a bat outta hell! I knew I didn't do any damage to the counter, so I figured since I was the "damaged party" I would just haul my embaressed ass outta there.  Tuesday, I head to Wendys for lunch. (figured I'd avoid Arbys)  I order, drive up to the window and hand the chickie a $10. Well, blondie let go of the bill and it goes flying up in the air and all over the parking lot. Now I can't just jump out of the Jeepster as I'm wearing a dress, and leaping over the shifter and out the side door was not an option. And I can't get out the drivers door, as I'm about 7 inches from her window. Patrons behind me are just sitting there, blondie is screaming, "it's on top of your Jeep", and flailing her arms. All this and I have to be back to work in like, ummm, 10 minutes ago. Well, this Wendys employee fellow pops out the side door to give another patron their dinner, and I jumped on the oppourtunity. "Hey, you there, my money....grab it" I yell at him, pointing to my ten spot doing another fly-by over-head. To make a long story short, he grabbed the bill for me, after a few acrobatic moves in the parking lot, and saved the day. I got back to work late, but the boss found my story amusing. (I'm sure he'll use the word amusing in my "write up".) Okay, on to Wednesday. I buzz by McDonalds just to grab one of their salad shakers...no biggie, right?? Yeah. Do the usual, pay, pick up order, leave. I get over to work, open the bag, and the asshole gave me the wrong salad! I paid for the more expensive one and he gave me the garden salad. And no dressing to boot! Well, I'm starved and I have no time to run back over and correct the mistake,( boss wouldn't have found this story amusing....nah) so I ate it while fuming. So you see, I have tried to eat at many different fast food places, but the results are always the same for me.......bad karma. (no pun intended) So today I pulled out my insulated lunch bag, filled it full of goodies, and no drive thru window will I see. Of course, I haven't tried just going in and ordering....maybe I'd have better luck.......nah.

      Not much going on in the ole cranium at the moment. Glad to have one lengthy day at "the grind" over with, one more to go, then all downhill from there. I put in for two vacation days next week. That will give me a nice five day stretch to do as I please......can you say..... be lazy?!! The  boss better not even give me any grief about it either, as I haven't taken any days since July and the morons I work with take days off like, every other week. I swear no one keeps track of their vacation days. Anyway, I'm looking forward to a nice stretch of "I'm gonna sleep in and do whatever the hell I wanna do"! Amen and goodnight!

      Man I'll tell ya, Mother Nature does not piss around when she changes the seasons around here. At least when we go from summer to winter. Yeah, fall lasts about a week at best here. We don't mess around....a few leaves hit the ground, then BAM, snow! In fact we had a bit of snow last Sunday, not much, perhaps a 1/4 inch or so before it melted. Enough to get my ass in gear on Monday, and put all the patio and lawn stuff away. I remember a few years back when my son and I trick-or-treated in a flippin' blizzard! We raked in the candy though.....everyone felt sorry for us, and only 3 or 4 other people were out, besides us. Man, I was in chocolate heaven for a month! Well worth the frostbite. *Kidding!* Well, those winter winds came howling tonight..........and the temp. dropped like a rock. We have a joke here in the "snow-belt". We have two seasons...winter and waiting for winter. So, on that note, got my winter coat washed, gloves ready, boots lined up...............let er rip!

      I think I have a great way to bring all this terrorism to a quick and casualty-free end. Crate up all the clowns I work with, air lift 'em over to Afghanistan, drop the idiots in the hills, wait a day or two, and watch the freakin' terriorists come a runnin'! No shit, these people could test the nerves of even the most hard core lunatics. I know, because I live through their twisted little, mind blowing antics every freakin' work day of the year. And I have the mental and digestive scars to show for it. No lie. I have a manager, who not only looks like, but manages like Hitler. Then there's the fella that farts every 5 freakin' minutes, then giggles & giggles; there's the neurotic socialite-wannabe, who imagines herself to have every illness known to man or is on the verge of getting one. After drinking green tea one afternoon, I told her that the side-effect would be that her skin would have a green tint for 24 hours. She spent the whole day showing everyone in the store her slowly "greening" limbs. Nut case. I got an ulcer because of this bitch.  Now we come to the chick that is so strung out on "whatever", that all she does is sleep all day, or when she is awake, and I use that term loosly, her eyes are half shut. She smokes, takes a 2 hour lunch, crashes out, the goes home. She hasn't been to work in like a month......heard she and a few friends got sloshed and rear-ended a parked car. Oopsie! Can you say DUI?? Ok, where was I? Another gentleman (or lack there of) I work with is referred to as "super perv". Gawks at young babes all day, making lewd remarks, etc. You get the picture. Every womans dream guy. Ugh. New guy is a stutterer. Now I know that he can't control this affliction, and his stuttering is not the main source of aggrivation. Fact is, he's a hyper stutterer. Shit, there's nohing like having someone running aroung like they're strung out on coke, while  trying to talk to you and they freakin stutter. We also have "bitch and moan". All this guy does, 24/7 is complain about everything! He makes up shit if theres nothing to bitch about. Hates his job, the wife, the traffic, on and on and on. To make a long story bearable, we also have: the manic depressant, the office slut/ valley girl (ya know), a fella from the "hood" who sings "My Girl" all damn day, and a host of  other amusing oddities that I call co-workers. So you see, I believe I have the perfect arsenol right here at my disposal. Free of charge, I can have em ready to go in a moments notice. Toss a few snacks in the crate, a case of beer or two, a blow up doll for perv boy, and they'd be filing in there pronto. A few nails, a one way ticket.....see ya!!  There's plenty of room in the crate, so if anyone has a co-worker or two to contribute, bring em on. The more the merrier. When in doubt....send in the clowns! (can you tell it was a long day??)

      Well my cover is blown.. now everyone knows who to blame for their gateway problems.......I am sorry Karma that I have not come by.. truth is I have been painting.. ceilings no less. So glad walmart is near.. keep running out of paint. Who ever invented open concept living didnt have to paint ceilings. I am busy packing for my trip.. had to wash everything first... sure hope its more fun than work.. as i am packing all my fun clothes.. lol While i am in Omaha I thought I would look for the bunker that Bush went into and try to get a pic....before they arrest me for getting too close. Well i promised i would blogg and will try when i am out of town.. but dont promise that one. See you all in a week.. bye.

      I ran into tricia the other day, and after she appologized for the lack of posts, she explained that she is going to Omaha for a week. She works for Gateway, and they are sending her there for training. Training sucks, getaway for a week....priceless! Enjoy.  I still think it's a lame excuse for not stopping in and at least saying Hi. I mean, how busy are you? Do you have to build the friggin' plane you're taking, or what?? Are you painting the house before you go?? What!!??  I'm brutal, I know, but I love ya! *wink*

      Well, I'm feeling a bit better than I was on Wednesday. Hell, I felt like I was gonna die or something. I seem have a problem where health issues are concerned....like I don't deal with them very well. In fact, I don't deal with them at all. I find myself at this stage somewhere between I'm young and nuthins' gonna happen to me, and, oh shit...everythings wrong with me. Usually I just try not to dwell on the little things. All of us have our aches and pains and such.......nothing that a bit of ibuprophen (or vicodin) can't smooth over. But then at times, like after I see enuff cancer and heart disease ads and stories, I'm like "oh my God, maybe I have that shit!!" So you see, I can  swing from let's pop a Tylenol... to call the mortician, quick.....in a heartbeat. Most of the time I just try to stay in a comfortable state of medical denial. I'll probably regret it someday. Anyway, for now, I am feeling better. Better living thru chemicals, indeed.

      Sorry 'bout lack of posts. Past couple of days I've been feeling like garbage....headaches, fatigue, eyes bugging me (I need glasses bad!) Anyway, I think I need to re-group here, and start taking better care of myself. This mid-life bullshit is for the birds, I'll tell ya!

      Today is one of those picture perfect fall days.........crystal clear, robins egg blue skies; foliage ablaze in reds, oranges and yellows. The air is crisp, but not cold. Love this shit! I went to "The Wal" yesterday, and bought our pumpkin and a pretty wreath of silk flowers for the door. Looks very nice indeed. I love our pumpkin...kinda lop-sided with a few dents here and there (kinda like me!) I never go for the perfect ones...they always get chosen. I think this obsession to always pick things that are a bit different from the "norm"  stems from school...I never got picked to be on the teams for dodge- ball, etc. Like the last choice. Ugh. So I always feel sorry for the underdogs, so to speak. Anyway, I'm headed out into this wonderful day, to get a few things done in the yard and enjoy a bit of sunshine while I'm at it. Man I could go for a slice of pumpkin pie right about now. Yummm!

      I just figured out today, that I am a "lazy ass" with good intentions. When I'm at work, and everyone is talking about our upcoming days off .....I'm just as into the "gotta get shit done around the house" as they are. Oh yeah! I need to clean up the yard, straighten up the house, wash the dog, bla, bla, bla. Then I get to those wonderful days off, and suddenly my resolve to conquer the dust bunnies wanes. Hell, it goes right out the damn window, into the yard that is waiting to be tended to. Now don't get me wrong, it's not like I get home for a few days and don't do anything. Oh, I saunter around and do a bit of this, and a bit of that. Wipe up here, sweep there. But those visions of "Martha-dom" elude me. Ok...I think the washer stopped. Screw it. It'll wait. I wonder what new sites I can find tonight?

      It's Sunday morning, and it doesn't get any better than this. Saw Hubbs and Ron (my brother-in-law) off a bit ago. Heading down to "The Burgh"....Ron going home and Hubbs staying the night as he has business down there tomorrow. So here I am, enjoying a day of "me time". Nice. Actually I have three days off, but I have plenty to do around this place. Gotta get my ass outside and "winterize," as Mother Nature doesn't seem like she's foolin' around this year. Damn it's cold, and those dark, winter clouds are just zooming along overhead. So wether my patio furniture is put away or not....winter is on it's way! Around here, it's either Winter or waiting for Winter. Lovely to live in the "snow-belt". Well, I popped a few cd's in our new stereo a bit ago, and I must admit it sounds really nice! Our old stereo didn't have a cd player, so I either had to listen to my cd's in the Jeep or my sons room. Not very convenient. Anyway, I feel like a kid at Christmas with my new "toy". And I am gonna enjoy my day today......just me, a few cd's and a hot mug of Orange Spice tea. Yummm.

       Celebrate Halloween? Need a Platinum card!  Is it me, or has Halloween turned into a major retail bonanza over the last few years?! When I was a kid, we dressed up and went around to houses that had the paper cut-outs in the windows, and a nicely carved and illuminated pumpkin outside the front door. Today, it's a real "keep up with the Jonse's," full blown, animated, illuminated gobblin bonanza, that starts in September! I've seen trailing lights, flashing ghosts of all shapes and sizes, whole front yards that look like a cemetery, fog machines, well you get the picture. Now I am in no way knocking these creative folks. Hey, if you want to bust your ass to hang up all this stuff, more power to ya!  All I'm saying is that it has gotten so commercialized...just like Christmas.  I live out in the sticks...no street lights, tar chip roads through the woods, spooky any night of the year. Halloween night it's  double spooky . I personally think that all this "Vegas style" Halloween decor takes away from the best fright doctor of them all...one's imagination.  Imagination is free. For everything else....there's MasterCard.

       Need someone to "kick your ass?" Look no further! Never ceases to amaze me, the bizarre and twisted things that pop up on the web. While checking out  urlLink Backwash  , it amused me that I could bid on a  urlLink "good ass-kickin "! I don't even know how to comment on this one. (And NO the bid on there is not mine!!) Hell, I get my ass kicked everyday for free. It's called a job.

      I am so jazzed! I bought a new stereo system yesterday.......a purchase that I feel has been  long  overdue. This one was advertised in the Sunday paper, at a store where I get my employee discount. I checked it out:  500 watts,  3 cd changer (that's all  we need), surround sound speakers, remote, all the fancy bells and whistles. Well by the time it was all said and done, I paid little more than the cost of small boombox for this sucker! I am a bargain hunter!  Love it. My son has it temporarily hooked up for me. W e have to remove the old one from its area, dust a bit,  then wire this one up properly. But you know how guys are. Just gotta get it hooked up and hear how it sounds. Duh, sounds like a radio. *smirk*  I officially haven't heard it "cranked" yet, but hell, anything will be an  improvement over the 20 year old fossil we had!

      Well, as of tonight, I've asked Baby Girl to be my coding "support person." You know, like in AA, if an ex- drinker feels the need to go out and have a few, they call their support person to talk them out of it? Well, Baby girl is the person I'm gonna call if I ever feel like pissing with the coding on my sites again! No shit...I tried to add some stuff, ended up screwing the whole thing to hell and back, and then had to take 2 hours to get it all to look just as it did in the first freakin' place. Damn it. *shakes head in disgust* So from now on, any time I feel the need to be "little miss freak around in the template area", I'm gonna call Baby, and she's gonna yell, '"do not touch the coding...just step away from the computer." Bless you Baby. Keep the pager on 24/7. Thanx!

      Full moon? I sure hope so that would mean that all of today will end and the morning it will be all better.  I am a single parent that happens to be married. Shiit sometimes life isn't fair.. Son woke today claiming he was ill... ok mad dash at the last moment to find a sitter... I find one that can stay for an hour... calling again... find another that can stay for two hours... ok.. well hell at least I can get to work.. driving a car pool sucks!! I leave 20 minutes late and hit every tractor in the entire farming community. Ok now in town and all the red lights.....arghhh. Pick up the people I need..who are also running late.. all of us on edge.. I have to stop and get a card for the office to sign.. death of a grandmother of a co-worker...for a brief moment daydreamed of that peaceful sleep.......I did snap out of it in time to follow a city bus.....choke, cough, oh pewww -- the rest  of the way to work. Today was moving day. They moved our office, which means out of the 100 pc's lucky if 30 are working. Of course the first two I try don't work. Finding my groove and a pc that works now and settle in.  I feel a shadow looming over me... I look up to see a new trainee standing eagerly beside me...shiit. This is what I need today. He introduces himself.. a rather nicely built man....but not sure what his face looks like. He never raised his head above my bust line.......After a few hours they come and tell me that due to my sons illness i can go home! Happy to go home until i see son is up and running around.......hes not sick!!!! Load his lil butt up and drive him to school.....home again and its only 1p.m. My sister calls and she is having the dog put to sleep.. oh man..............i should have stayed in bed. I won't even go into the frogs escaping in my kitchen........arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Full moon indeed.

      I'm leaving the day behind.......shaking off the crud left behind by the morons. Everyone at work just sapped my energy today, for one reason or another. I couldn't wait to get away from them. I felt so much better when I got home, went outside in the cool air. I felt like I could breathe again. I wasn't trapped anymore....... listening to their idiotic babble. On and on. I thought the day would never end. But now I feel calm and relaxed. When I go out into the cool  night air, and everything is quiet ,except for the rustle of wind in the trees, I come together again. I'm back in touch with me. I can think again....clear thoughts. One with the night. Goodnight.

      I don't wanna be a grown-up tonight. I don't want to know that my Mom is in the hospital and having a bad time of it. I don't want to be my Mom's Mom. I don't want to go to bed again and ask God to make her well, like I have done for the past 40 years. I pray for her, but that's all I can do. I want to call my Mom with my worries, and hear her say that it will be allright. I've never known what it's like to do that, and I never will. I have to be the strong one, and right now I don't want to be. I don't mean to sound selfish, but sometimes even the strong need love too. I miss my Mom.

      I feel angry, helpless and frustrated tonight. I try very hard to be a patient and kind person, and yet I feel like I continually get emotionally "beat up" all the time. Like certain  people think, "Hey, she's a push-over, I think I'll just dump all my mental bullshit on her". God I'm getting sick of it. Being a safe haven for everyone that has some sort of neuroses, is bullshit. Hey, like I have feelings too. I learned how to handle my bullshit, by my own self. The hard way.  Get a clue. Get a fuckin self-help book and read it. Get your heads outta your asses and grow up already. I did. I'm not your supreme life leader. I'm not Buddah and I don't have all the answers. When I offer em' you don't listen anyway. Why is it the people with the biggest mouths, know the least?

       There's no place like home... I used my days off to get all our Christmas stuff up, and now I go back to work just as tired as when I left. I'm a tad bit frustrated too. I really do love putting all the holiday decor together, even though it is alot of work. I've done it solo for the past 20 years. But I gotta tell ya, it's starting to wear a bit thin anymore. It's getting to be a bit of a pain to work full time, run a house and be the Christmas freakin' fairy too. And then to add insult to injury, my not-so-helpful-elves ask, "what's stressin' you out so bad"? Are they brain dead or what? Now these comments are coming from people that on their days off do next to nothing. Hubbs golfs so much anymore, I'd like to wrap a club around his neck. And the teenager has to rest for 20 hours after working for 6. Sometimes I feel like Dorothy in the Land of Oz. Who are these weird people I'm with, where the hell's the Wizard, and how do I get home??  Help!!!!

      I know I haven't been here in a few days, and for this I do appologize. But with the crazy holiday hours, I've been a step above dead by the time I get home, and the  last  thing I've felt like doing is sitting down and putting my thoughts here. You wouldn't have wanted to hear em anyway. Well, today was a new day............and a day off to boot. I was really into getting our Christmas stuff up, so I dug in and got a good start. I was soooo thrilled yesterday when I opend the new tree I bought on Saturday and it was perfect!! I mean, absolutely perfect! It's a 7 foot slim profile tree that fits just right in the small space we have. I was pretty bummed that our other tree wouldn't fit this year ( thanks to my computer desk) and there was no way that we were not gonna have a tree. A  table top tree was not an option here. Anyway, it's just right, and looks great already,  even if it only has lights on it at the moment.

When is it my turn to get a break?  Hell I am working tomorrow and avoiding all the shit at home. Be damn glad to be at work too. Did i just say that?  think i need to start drinking.  As for the xmas shopping Karma.....yeah i mowed down three old ladies to get the cd player for your ungrateful ass.....think i will just keep it for myself now!!  Not! Karma is the greatest woman i know. I would pay full price.......maybe .....well if the line is really long and i have to get up at 6.....yeah shes worth full price. Nite

      Happy Black Friday. For anyone working retail, this translates to " I can't wait to start work at the butt-crack of dawn, and greet a crazy mob of bargain hunting lunatics, with little or no regard for their fellow shoppers, and keep a big smile on my face as they grab my shirt trying to get my attention, all the while saying Happy Holidays, and listening to White Christmas being played for the 100th freakin' time in 9 hours." And the season has just started. I personally think that all the "America stands united" stuff totally went out the window this morning, when they're standing at Wal Mart at 6am, anxiously waiting for the doors to open so they can get that $19.99 CD player for their best friend. Boy oh boy,  you'll be a big hero on her list when you tell her that you plowed down 5 old ladies while racing to the electronics department for that special gift. Go you!!  I guess all consideration for your "fellow Americans" goes right down the tubes when sales and bargains are involved.

      Happy Thanksgiving. for the past couple of days I have been taking care of Karma's Queen.. the family pet. She is so sweet and so old and so frail looking. I Love her to death.. Tonight I left my dog out and went to Karma's to take the Queen out... lumbering as she does to the back yard I followed her.. feeling so sorry for this once scary as shit dog.....my dog hears us and breaks her chain coming over... the Queen still has it in her!!! She drug me all the way to Karma's front door after my dog. Of course chicken shit dog that I have ran like hell home. The Queen enters her home and stands looking at me with a smile* gotta love that old lady. Thanks for letting me care for the Queen.  On the topic of old woman...... I called my own mother to wish her a happy turkey day.... and you know what.......I can't remember hanging up the phone! I worried all day that I hung up while she was talking. I was scared I had a major brain fart and would prob soon fall over dead of a brain aneurysm.. (spelling left to the reader). After many hours of trying to reason what happened to the phone call I swallowed my pride and called her back. When I explained this to her she laughed and said she wished she had known she would have "played" me for all I was worth!  Come to realize my sister had taken the phone to say hello to her and when she was done she had hung up. I was busy doing the dishes and had not even noticed. So Mom say's "had I known I would have called you back and chewed you out for hanging up on me, just to hear your reaction"........like I don't carry enough guilt for the world.. Mom has to add to it whenever possible.......Gotta Love them old ladies.  Off to take my geritrol and climb into my posturepedic bed... nite all......

      Ya know, something just came to me. I think the reason I have a hard time designing web pages is because I don't have a "geek-type" brain. Now exactly what this involves, I dunno. All I do know, is that everyone that seems to be any good at this shit usually uses the word "geek" somewhere in their conversation. I hope this is not the case, as I don't aspire to become a geek in any way, shape or form. Since high school, geek doesn't really hold wonderfully positive imagery.  Still doesn't. I wonder if there is hope for me....a non-geek trying to make a web page. God I hope so.

      I awoke today in a very calm and peacful state of mind, and  I'm so happy to have my inner calmness back. It's very hard to stay in this place, as outside influences fight to enter and disrupt the tranquility. I'm back to meditation again, as it keeps me centered and focused, although I don't do it as much as I probably should. There is so much stress related negativity in the air anymore, what with all that has happened over the past couple of months. Sometimes I feel like a sponge, in that I absorb the vibes around me. At times it can be overwhelming, like it has been lately, and that's when I need to retreat from it all for awhile and re-group. So for the time being I'm not reading the paper, watching the news or discussing current events. What is, is and what will be, will be. I will now find bliss in a hot bubble bath, a steaming cup of orange spice tea and a night filled with zzzzzzzzzzz's.  Ahhhhhhhh!  Sweet dreams.

      I have beautiful "little sparkles" in my life.......my friends. I don't have many, but just as with precious gems, only one or two is all you need to feel special. They are rare gems indeed, and they have a radience in their souls, that burns brighter than anything I've ever known. Or will ever know. They are fragile spirits, but strong souls, and my life has been made ever so magical because of their presence in it. Thank you for your beautiful gift of just being you, my friend. Thanks for sharing this journey we call life, with me. I just thought you should know. I just felt you needed to know.                        Love.

      Tonight, no not just tonight actually, but for awhile now.....I feel the need to go deeper here. Past the usual bullshit.... work, home, holidays, politics, moods, etc. Bla, bla, bla. There's more going on in my head, and my soul,  but I just can't tap into it. I need to move others thoughts out, and dig deeper into my own.  I'm getting real bored, real fast with superficial ramblings. Tired of writing them....even more weary of reading them. I find nothing worth reading right now.

      Work today didn't start out well at all. Everything was fine and dandy till I hit the front door, then all "commission hell" broke loose. Joe informed me that the huge deal we were working on, had all but dwindled to nothing. These assholes have been pissing with us for a week now, and frankly we've had just enuff of their bull shit. The only thing that was keeping us civil was that they were spending ten thousand freakin dollars. Hell ya I'm an ass-kisser for ten grand. Then to boot, another deal I made, and delivered, didn't fit in the customers door, so they not only returned it, they decided there was nothing else they liked in the store. Another one bites the dust. So as you see, I started my day by losing a shit load of moolah. The day didn't get much better after that either.  *sigh*

      I had a revelation this afternoon. I will never be rich, thanks to Wal Mart and *insert any Dollar Store name here*. Thats the truth as I see it....the cold, hard fact. I can not walk into a Wal Mart or a Dollar Store and only get what I went in for. Never, never, ever. Although I must say the worst of the two is the Dollar Store. I mean, how can you go wrong when everything is a buck!!  Suddenly, shit I don't even need, becomes instantly attractive with a $1.oo sticker on it. My bank account is forever doomed.

       Great, I have a friggin headache now. I was surfing the web a bit ago, just randomly checking out new sites, and I'll tell ya what.... some of the sites out there are enuff to give you an anurism. Just to navigate through some of their pages, takes longer than it took to build the Brooklyn Bridge, for gods sake! Ya get flash pages, twirling icons, flashing buttons, a gazillion links, all kinds of circus bullshit, just to arrive at.........Nuthin. No content. No brain cells firing here. Nada.  Now, by no content, I don't in anyway mean the folks that talk about their everyday lives and such. You don't have to be a Hemigway or a journalist to have a good, interesting, enjoyable site. I'm talking about folks that spew out their mangled brainwaves onto the web, and you can't even figure out what the hell they're talking about. (This is where I ran into trouble, I tried to make sense of the writings.)  Random incoherent sentences, meant to fry the brain cells, of the likes of you and me. Hey, if you're on a friggin' morphine drip, don't try to write a journal buddy. If you just put down your crack pipe, don't blog and screw up my cranium, as I try to find a shred of sense in your drug induced words of wisdom. And the bitch of it is, that you have to go through all the "hypnotica"  bullshit, to get to the "no content" part. So, after hitting about 10 of these entertaining sites, here comes the headache.  Needless to say, no new links will be added tonight. Advil please. Or better yet, pass the morphine drip.

      It was a beautiful, spring-like day today, and I really enjoyed the fact that I was home and being lazy on this pretty day. I ran into town for a bit, and stopped in at Earthshine for a look around. I haven't been there for awhile, and I felt like picking up a few tid-bits for myself. I bought some  urlLink incense , a pair of fairy earrings, a dragonfly earring and a beautiful fairy/crystal pendant. I just love browsing around in that store....kind of a hippie type store with lots off neat beads, jewelry, cd's, clothes, etc. I never leave empty handed, and the owner (I can't remember her name, but she's a sweetheart) always gives me a deal on whatever I buy. Super people indeed. Now it's  really  pissin' me off that I can't remember her name. Sheesh.

      First, I want to appologise for not bloggin' along with the group in so long.  Feel free to yell at me in the comments!!  It's all good though! I'm pleased to report I got my mom "hooked up" on the internet tonight.  Had to install a router and run some network cable, but she is up and running!  She's used to using AOL, so I think that getting acclimated to the regular "web browser" interface is a little new to her.  But I gotta give her credit - she's doing a great job.  I think she's just happy to be able to download MP3s again (her true love, LOL). Oh, and Nick's birthday party was great, even if it didn't go exactly according to plan!  Often, I think, those unplanned surprises are more fun anyway!!

       Happy, Happy 19th Nick!!!!  Tomorrow is my son Nicks 19th birthday.... 19!!   Yikes , where has all the time gone?? It just  totally  blows my mind to think that I have a 19 year old son. After all, I sure as hell don't feel any older than that myself!  (well....maybe just a tad bit) I mean, it wasn't  that  long ago that I was 19. (well, maybe it was a little bit ago)  But all that aside, sheesh, things are moving way too fast here. It seems that when they're little, time just seems to drag it's feet....slowly moving from diapers, to training pants, to potty training to "big boy undies", all to the tune of lullabyes and nursery rhymes. Days spent playing, napping, watching TV and giggling.....blowing bubbles and watching Sesame Street. Like one long, flowing pastel memory, it just floats on by. Slow and easy. Then you hit the middle school and high school years, and all hell breaks loose!  Hormones break loose, the attitude kicks into high gear and it's just like that bumper sticker says..."Get in, sit down, buckle up and hold on....it's gonna be a bumpy ride'".  Amen.  Couldn't have said it better myself. A mom must have thought up that one, 'cause it describes the ride from 12 on perfectly. It's fast, it's furious and it sure as hell is bumpy. Now after around 15, things really get wild. Begin blurr here. You have a new driver on the road, who hopefully hasn't just seen "The Fast & the Furious". Waiting for them to arrive safely home is the new ritual.  This is the time to give that cel phone as a gift. No excuse for being late!! Girlfriends are also a big factor here, and these also affect not only the raging hormones but the attitude factor. Luckily, we have been very fortunate in this area. ( the girlfriend part, not the attitude. We have attitude to spare!)  Our son has a girlfriend that we totally love to pieces. Amanda's a sweetie. Other parents aren't as lucky. I've heard the stories. Before ya know it, you're on to Senior year.......senior photos, class ring, (get out the Platinum card...don't put away yet), Prom, after Prom, graduation, graduation party, graduation gift, school tuition, prozac, alchohol & rehab. The last three items are for us parents. Platinum card just upped your limit!!! They  love you man !!  So here we are again, back at 19.  We're very fortunate, our son Nick is a great guy. An honest kid, doesn't party, has nice friends, and really hasn't given us much trouble along the journey  from diapers to adulthood. So a big Happy 19th Birthday Nick!  Enjoy every moment of your special day. All our love to you always....but you know that. And hey, let's try to slow thing down a bit, okay? Sheesh!!  *hugs*

      Hey there!   Glad i finally got a moment to check out the neighbors... I too saw the stealths......but didnt know what i was watching until now.. now i know i was aposta be scared. I was a ways from them but they were really attention getters.....nothing so stealth about them at night.  I am down in the dumps and tried to stay away from human kind as of late. Feeling a bit better  so  you just may see me for coffee and pie yet. Work has been odd... there is a native there that came to me the other day and wanted to know what  was going on. She said she felt they were all out to get me.. that she could see the trap being laid. I have felt it for a week now.. I just am unsure of the reason behind it. My pay was short $150.......so now do i go and complain on top of all thats going on? Shit ....... i need me a sugar daddy that likes me. Oh well off to work again in the morn so nitey nite.

      My nerves are frazzled. I have a $10,000.00 deal pending at work. Needless to say, this would really be a big boost to my sales this month....and deals like this come along once in a blue moon. Problem is my customer is a rich, nose in the air, undecisive asshole who keeps playing phone-tag games with me. God if this all comes together, I'll be one happy chicka indeed!

      Other than working till 10PM, today should be a good day at work. This is the wonderful time each month that we not only get our pay check, but our comission check as well. That is if you've been good, and sold enuff to please the "retail gods" as it were. The "gods" should be reasonable happy with me this month....though not elated. Basically, October sucked sales wise, and we had to scratch and claw for every freakin dollar. Hmf. Well, it's off to the "Grind" I go to mix and mingle with the dysfunctional mass I call co-workers. Later!

       Sighting of Stealths slows interstate traffic  Interesting little story. Hubbs gets in from his long day on the road, and tells me that while he was traveling on interstate 79 this evening, (just after dusk), he noticed some lights in the sky that he thought were tower lights. Now, he found this quite unusual, as there are no towers in this area. (he's a private pilot, so he knows his tower locations around here). Upon further inspection, the lights turned out to be the lights on the undersides of 2  Stealth Bombers , flying slowly at around 1,ooo feet or so! He flipped out! He said he almost slammed on his brakes to watch, (not a cool thing to do on an interstate!) Everyone else on the road  was slowing  to catch a glimpse too. "They were  huge ", he said. When I asked him why they'd be around here, flying so low and slow, he said that there was an airplane flying around the Beaver Nuclear Power Plant yesterday , and that it disappeared. Radar couldn't track where it went. So they must be on patrol in the area.  Hubbs then went on to tell me that you're not allowed to fly within a 10 mile radius of a nuclear power plant. Scary stuff.

      I must say that I was a bit disappointed by the  urlLink Ghost Cams  I checked out  last night. Hey, I figured Halloween night, full moon, midnight....lots of ghosts on the move right? Not. At least if they were, it wasn't where or when I was looking. Just thought it would be cool to see a spectre on Halloween. Okay, so I don't get out much. Sue me.

      Well, another Halloween has come and gone, and I must say I was a bit disappointed, though not surprised, with the low count of kids out Trick or Treating last night. I even went out yesterday and bought extra candy (wishful thinking), so that I wouldn't run out. Lemme tell ya, not only didn't I run out......but I now have enuff candy to last me thru 2003. Really. I don't know if it's a good thing or not that I buy the candy that I love. If I'm not a diabetic now....I will be in about 6 months, as there's enuff sugar in that big bag of candy to send a dinosaur into shock! (Guess I'll have to pace myself, eh?) It was a beautiful night to be out, and the full moon was just gorgeous.

      Well kids, "Mother Christmas" has just about wrapped things up. *no pun intended*  The afternoon drive home from work didn't start out that well. In fact it didn't start at all....my car that is. I got in, turned the key, and.........nothing, nada, silence. Damn. So I went inside and asked if any of my co-workers had cables and one of the guys did, so he came out to help me. Well, while he was hooking up the jumpers, I noticed that if he wiggled the left cable, my lights flickered on, then off. He figured out that it wasn't a dead battery, *phew*, but a loose terminal wire. So he tightened it for me, I thanked him, and I was on my way. Thank-you Jeff!    I picked up a few things for our Christmas dinner at Wal Mart, (and a set of cables for my car!!), and I was on my way home. I baked a few dozen cookies and finished wrapping our gifts, then gave Nick a hair cut and well....here I am. Gonna shower and hit the sheets in a bit, as I have to work tomorrow, but luckily not till 1.     Earlier tonight, Hubbs kept asking me, "Now what was it you wanted for Christmas"? I really hope this man is kidding with me. Either that, or he's a bloomin' fruitcake. What is it with guys and this last minute shit? Oh well, I'm sure as hell not gonna try to figure that one out. He better be playin' games here. If he isn't, then he can stand in line tomorrow with all his male counterparts, who think that shopping at the last minute and getting all the crumpled left-overs is a way cool ritual of some sort. "High five" guys.....shop on. Sheesh. Peace.

      Shit, I gotta go back to work tomorrow to rest my weary bones. These past three days off have just about worn me out!  I've done laundry, wrapped dozens of gifts, detailed the interior of my new ride, scrubbed the carpets in the Jeepster, ran the sweeper in the house,  ran the sweeper in the Jeepster, rode down to the 'Burgh with Hubbs to pick up his car, drove back home,  picked up a few last minute gifts, ironed clothes, did my nails for work........well, you get the picture. Freakin' busy. Never did get to the cookies. That happens on Friday after work. One thing that did help  elievate  my stress, was my sis-in-law ok'd us visiting with them on Christmas eve day instead of Christmas. This frees us up to come home on X-mas eve, and enjopy a nice lazy holiday at home.......before back to the "shit pit" on Wednesday. Jr. is all happy too.... now he can see  Amanda on Christmas Day. Yeah...everyone is happy!! Now on to the pit tomorrow........ugh. And to all a goodnight! Peace.

      Car update: Hubbs brought my new ride back from the 'Burgh on Friday, and I just  love  it!! It's a pretty champagne color, with lots of chrome and a very luxurious interior. She has a few minor dings on her, but hey, she's 11 years old!  I have a few dings on me too....you're gonna get "dings" if you're doin' life right!  Right out in front and center. So I cleaned her up a bit today, and took my things out of the Jeep, and put them into my new baby. Now it feels like mine. I went out last night and bought some new mats for the front and a neat plate for the front bumper that says "Here comes trouble". Need I say more? Nah. Anyway, I think my new ride and I are gonna have a good time together. Snow will be the real test though. Should be fine with front wheel drive. All the cars I've had before with front wheel drive, just plowed through the snow with no problem. Hubbs and I have to drive down to the 'Burgh in the morning............he's picking up his car, and going on to do his work, and I'm heading back home to do Christmas stuff. Wrapping, baking, etc. I only have today and tomorrow to finish up, but as always, it gets done! Well, gotta hit the sheets.....have to be up early, ugh! Nite!

      Well, oh, well. I got all our holiday shopping done today.    Stress free to boot. Trick of it is to go on a weekday if possible........man what a difference from the freakin' weekends.    Now all I have to do is wrap them, pick up a few small odds and ends, and voila',  Mother Christmas is done. (I call myself Mother Christmas. Like Mother Nature...If I don't make it happen, it ain't happenin', dig?)    Well, all except for a bit of baking I still have yet to do, but nothing major there. Whip up a few sugar cookies and all is well in "let's have an anti Martha Stewart kinda Christmas" land.  Life is good.

       New meaning to "Express Lane"  Oh my God...........shopping nirvana!! I went over to Gabriels on my lunch hour today to return a top. Well low and behold, a sign that read, all Express jewelry $.99!!!  WTF!  Well, needless to say, I went ape-shit! I ended up with 20 pieces of awesome jewelry. I spent $20.00, but the regular retail added up to over $400.00!! Man deals like this make me too friggin' giddy! Indeed.

      I am technologically frustrated tonight. Ya see, I'm a creative person. Give me a sketch pad and a pen, and I'll zip off a drawing in a heartbeat. Hand me a tablet and a pencil, and I'll write you a poem. Show me a house and I'll decorate it to the nines. But let me try to put together a web page, and I'm lost in cyber hell!  God, must it be so freakin' complicated??!  I wanna put some graphics on this blog page, but I don't have a place to store my graphics. When I do get a site for them, I can't figure out how to get them here. I have a site that I can't ftp my blog page to, and I have a site that I can ftp to, but I can't figure that shit out either!!  Damn it. Now I'm not a stupid person, but trying to figure this shit out is like a damn rubics cube for me. I make a bit of headway in one area, only to be screwed in another. What anal, monkey minded, dip shit invented all this complicated bullshit? Now I know there are people out there who are gonna say, " It's really not all that hard", yada, yada, yada. Bite me.  When you're trying to figure this all out yourself, with little or no background in this shit....it is hard. I know there gotta be others like me..............the cyber fucked. We're the ones with the pages with errors out the ass, and shit going on that we don't even remember doing. Our pages are bland, cause we can't figure out how to access the hundred freakin graphics we have. Yeah we have em, you just can't see em. God I'm pissed here.

       I'll have a non-platinum Christmas without you......... I miss my credit cards. *sigh* I've been credit card free for about 6 months now, and it's not been that bad up untill now. This is the time of year when I really had a field day with the old plastic, and getting used to a "cash only" Christmas is a bit hard to adapt to. But I'm doing it. *another sigh* See before, if I saw it and wanted it, I got it. Now, I really have to make sure I have the moolah for it, which kinda puts a small damper on my spending spree. Gotta fit into the budget. *rolls eyes* I hate the word budget............so restricting, considering I'm not filthy rich. But I gotta do this for my own good. Being debt free does feel good, I must admit, but this time of year is a real test for me. I feel like a recovering alchoholic sitting at  Frat party.  Just Pepsi for me. *sigh*

      Well, hopefully I will be heading down to the 'Burgh next week to pick up my new Winter ride. It's a gold 1990 New Yorker......hubby says it's a pretty car. I can't wait to get it!  I'll miss my Jeepster though......she got me through many rough winters, and has been a very reliable ride for the past 5 years. Oh well, gotta move on. Hubbs asked me what I want for Christmas, and I said I'd love a remote starter for the car. I hate getting out of work late, and having to trudge through the snow to start my vehicle. And around my house, my car is always the one parked out in the weather, as I get home after everyone else does, so I get the suck-ass parking spot. I  need  this remote starter..... bad !  I should get it, as I've been  very good  this year!!  Like a fine wine, I get better with age................whooo!

      I'll tell ya, no matter how wonderful this streak of warm weather has been, it feel pretty strange as we get closer to Christmas. I feel like I'm down in the South somewhere. I have the decorating pretty much wrapped up, some shopping done, and I'll be writing out the cards this weekend. But something is amiss without the snow. I dunno, just feels strange to me without it. And it's not just the lack of snow. It's friggin' too warm out for this time of year! The good thing is, that at least this year, I got the lights put up without a blizzard swirling around me, and my neighbors watching from their windows in amusment as I cursed the tangled wires and burned out bulbs, and stapled my glove to the window sill. Ah, fond memories indeed. Anyway, things are rolling around pretty well in holiday prep land. Now, all I need is a sprinkling of snow and some major hints from a few people on  my gift list. Fa la la la la la la la la!

      Today has been a day much like the rest. The rat race is in full swing and i believe i have cheese in my pockets. Everyone is after me. To be alone for ten minutes was all i wanted. On the ride home i stop in a parking lot and shut down for ten minutes.. damn thats sad when you cant find a quiet corner to call your own. Feel sorry for me yet? I think i can still be adopted... one800lifesucks. $1.95 per minute. Girls gotta eat you know? just wanted to post something.. nothing really going on in my life .. playing phone tag with the doctors this week to get results.. think they just want to stress me out so they can doctor me for stress!!! later Krazy

      Today as I was leaving work, I told the woman that drove on the "ride from hell" yesterday, that I was getting her a Guardian Angel visor clip to protect her when she drives. She turns to me and says, "Why that's so thoughtful of you, you're always so sweet". Shit, she really thinks she's a good driver. Either that, or my smart-ass skills need honing.  Hmmmmmm.

      Note to self: never, ever, never ever, ride with any co-workers, to any meetings, anywhere, ever.  Period . Today was the  second  time that I had near death experiences while riding with a co-worker to an out-of-state meeting. Two times, two crazy ass freakin' drivers. Not good crazy.... suck ass, nail biting, feet pressed to the floor board, praying to God crazy !  I should have known I was in trouble when we got into the car, and she drove with her chest against the wheel. We merged onto the interstate (merging is a whole nuther story), and thats where it all goes awry. Speed limit in the highway is 65, so most are  driving around 70 or so. Well not us. We Couldn't just maintain one speed. Hell no....we like variety here, so lets just try out all the speeds. In fact, we'll alternate like every 20 seconds or so. So lets go 55, then up to 70, drop down to 50 for a bit, then speed up to 65 only to drop down to 55 cause a truck ahead of us is creeping along. Now we could pass him, as there's no one in the passing lane. For miles. But no, we'll follow him for a bit. Just chat and enjoy the scenery. Then we get a brain-storm like, "Oh yeah, we do have to be at that meeting by Noon, huh?, hit the gas, and launch ahead like freakin' rocket. Well this went on for a 'bout an hour and a half or so. Anyway to make a long story short, we took a wrong exit and had to loop around again, then we got into a funeral procession going 20 mph, and  finally  ended up at the meeting on time. Amen, I'm still alive at this point.  See prayer does work!! On the ride back, just do everything in reverse, but no funeral procession. Needless to say, I was ecstatic to get back to my Jeep and drive again. I can't believe these folks make it anywhere alive.

      I'm having a bland day today. I hate these kinda days...not happy, not sad.........somewhere in between. Bland. "Bland Land". I think I just have too much going on in the ole cranium, and rather than go nuts, I've gone to "Bland-Land". That has to be it. A survival skill, that enables one to cruise along and not inflict bodily harm on those in the general vicinity, that are in an overly goofy, Three Stooges kinda mood today. And in my face about it. So better to be bland, than be incarcerated. I hope my "stooge" realizes that he was spared because of the blandness.

      Sorry 'bout the lack of posts over the past couple of days, but between trying to get a new web page up and running, and a bad case of PMS, I either didn't have time to get here or I just didn't give a rats ass. Nothing exciting going on here anyway. Well, I really shouldn't say that........Hubbs did get my car running properly yesterday. That made me very happy indeed. Hopefully, the days of "hot wiring" it to get it started are over!  And I did get all the Christmas decor put away on Wednesday. But it's been down-hill ever since. There's so much I want to do, but I'm just not in the mood, and it's getting me frazzled! I really thought I was gonna get alot of tasks done while I was on vacation, but for some reason, that plan has hit the skids. Enter mental confusion.  I guess the only thing to do is just roll with it, and cruise along. Go with the flow.  I think I have a big load up in the ole cranium, and that's about all it wants to handle right now. Some of my current mental stirrings are: an aging dog (my baby girl)  that I have to make a decision on wether to put her to sleep or not, aging parents (Mom hasn't been well, and they live far away), a job that is stressing me out more every day, and a few other biggies I don't feel like getting into. Maybe a good nights sleep will help me to see matters in a clearer light. Hopefully calmer too. And in the mean time, let the dust-bunnies run amuck!!

      You know, I just love my new car, but lately it's driving me buggy with starting problems. Problem is.........it doesn't want to start. Well, when  it  wants to start it does. Unfortunately, this usually doesn't coincide with when  I  want it to start. There you have it. Just call my car "Christine". For those of you that might not have seen the movie, it's about a posessed car named Christine. Now, I have asked three different guys what the problem is, and I got three different answers. And you wonder why I want to learn about auto mechanics. Nuff said. I guess I'll just have to wait till Hubbs takes a look at it, and we decide what needs to be done to remedy this annoying situation. The sooner the better. Right now, she's being cooperative....even allowing the remote starter to do it's thing. Tomorrow morning.........who knows. Guess we'll have to see what mood "Christine" is in when it's time to leave for work.

      I just got done shoveling the snow from my driveway. You have no idea what a  miracle  this is. I haven't shoveled snow in friggin' years, but since Hubbs is driving home tonight instead of tomorrow, I wanted him to be able to get in the drive safely. Especially since he's not going to be here till after 2 a.m.. Anyway, I survived the shoveling without a heartattack. (Refer back to Wednesday...."survived walk without heartattack"). Hey, this shit happens. So yeah, Hubbs is heading North as I type. I left him a voice-mail this morning about the snowstorm that was gonna move in tomorrow, and that maybe he should get his butt in gear and haul it on home early. He is. I'm glad. I won't be happy 'till I know he's in the house and safe though. Work today just makes me long for my upcoming weeks vacation even more. The idiots were prime today..........I just kept to myself. Tomorrow is gonna be a bitch....Saturdays always are, with both teams working 4 hours together..... retail bedlam at it's finest! Then we found out today, that on Monday and Tuesday we're having some kinda January clearance sale, and we're working 10 to 10. Surprise! Holy MacShit Ronald! The only thing that's gonna motivate me through those two days, is knowing that I'll be off the whole following week. Amen!

      What an evening! My trip to "The Bug" was enjoyable.I came out with a silver chain belt, a black beaded necklace, a silver necklace with red enamel lips in the middle and two great tops..........all at 30% off the clearance prices! Retail "high five"!!  then I went over to the dollar Tree and picked up a few odds and ends. when I got home, tricia was standing at my door with a huge beautifully wrapped box, and a big grin on her face. Scared the shit out of me at first, cause there usually isn't someone standing in the dark at my door at 9 in the evening.  I invited her in, and I unwrapped my "belated birthday gift"..............a great pasta gift set, and a bottle of raspberry cologn spritz with little fairies on the cap. What a nice, and thoughtful surprise! Thanx darlin'! *smiles* She stayed for coffee, and we gabbed a bit about work and all kinds of stuff. It was nice. We don't see eachother as much as we'd like, but when we do get together it's like no time has passed at all. If you look up the meaning of true friend, all it needs to say is Tricia. Nuff said.                  Amanda stopped over later in the evening, and gave me a big hug. *smiles again* What a sweetie pie she is! She ordered pizza and wings for all of us, which was really a sweet thing to do. Needless to say they were yummy! Thanks for the goodies Manda.....my treat for that lunch we've been talking about!  Ole'!  Well, I gotta hit the sheets......my eyes are blurry and that usually my signal to go to bed. Nite all!! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

      They called me from the car audio place, and said that my car was ready. Woohoo! Well, my son didn't get out of work for another hour, so I decided to hoof it down to the shop. Now realize that the shop is only about a mile or so from my house, but the fact that it it very cold out and I haven't done any serious "hoofing it" in a long time mad it a bit of a challenge for me. Like, since I smoke, will I have a friggin' heart attack on the way over, and be left in the ditch for days, or at least untill the snow melts? Could happen.  So to cover myself, I called my son and left a message in his voice-mail, to search the ditches along the road if I wasn't home by 6. Good plan huh? I thought so. Needless to say, I arrived there in one (frozen) piece, and AJ showed me how to use the remote to start my car, etc. I nodded, and said "uh huh" a few times, and I was on my way. Ten minutes later, I was calling him saying, "Uh, what was that little button on the bottom for again"? He was very patient in answering my questions, but I'm sure as hell he was thinking "dumbass". Oh well. I'm not a  dumbass, but my memory is shot to hell. I think it happened in the 70's or there abouts. Dunno. I can't remember. See. Happened again! Tonight I'm gonna head up to Fashion Bug for a bit, do a bit of "browsing", so I'll get to give it a road test. I'm glad I didn't get a car alarm. Man, you screw up on those things, everyone within a 20 mile radius knows you're a dweeb-o. And even if someone was stealing your car, no one would notice. They would just think it was someone with a new alarm, look over, grin, and go right back to doing whatever. Well, off to make dinner, then spend a bit of time at "The Bug". Browsing, Yeah. *wink wink*

      I ordered another book to help me with my upcoming 'Vette purchase. The other book I ordered from Corvette Central just didn't have the info I needed. It's going back. So anyway, I called to order  urlLink "Secrets to buying a used Corvette" , and my order was taken by the author himself, Bill Gall. Nice guy.......and he  really  knows his stuff! I asked him if he'd sign my book for me, and he said "No problem.....but I don't think it's gonna add any value to the book"! Lol! Should have it by next week. I can't wait!

      I'm off work today and doin' nuthin'. Life is good, I'll tell ya! And as I type this, I'm listening to music I downloaded to burn onto a CD later. This is a  miracle  to me. Where was all this cool shit when I was growing up?? Hell, if you wanted music you had to  buy  it, and then you had to get the whole cassette to get that one song you loved. Oh this downloading stuff is way too cool! I'm gonna be making CD's like there's no tomorrow. Oh yeah. My own life sountrack! Now I just have to wait till my son shows me how to burn 'em.......always a catch. My guys always go on a power trip when it comes to showing me how to do things on my computer. Thats okay, I just tell 'em I'll wait. No hurry. I know they would love me to pester them, like the info they have is  so  valuable to me that I just have to have it now. Not! I'll wait. Ha Ha. I went without this shit for 44 years, one more day doesn't mean squat to me.          I took my car to the Audio Shop this morning to have the remote starter installed. It will be  so  nice to start the damn thing without trudging out in the snow in the morning or after work. One of the guys at work was ribbing me as to why I need a remote starter. After giving him my reasons, he was still giving me a hard time about it, so I just said "Cause I want one, thats why, so shut the hell up about it already". He shut up. It's pityful how easy it is to shut these guys down. Throw 'em a bit of attitude and they back right off. Wimps. No challenge whatsoever. Gotta love my Hubby. He always gives me a run for my money! Love it!!             I'm not doing shit today............just relaxing and watching the day float by. Hubbs is in North Carolina with his brother for 5 days on a golf trip....so I'm goofing off for a couple of days! I've turned my back on the dust bunnies and laundry. I strolled by the un-made beds.....no problem!  Now tomorrow, I'll be in the groove again. I can only stand this shit around me for one day, then I gotta dig in. Don't wanna go into it now though..........today is for goofing off!  Like I said before........life is good!

       Born to be Wild Another lovely day off today.........God I love these days off. I need to find a job I love, not just one that pays the bills. Anyway, I think Hubbs and I are going to take a ride down to Corvette City today and walk the lot, just to see what they have out there. Spring is just around the corner and I wanna have plenty of cruisin time with my new baby this year. I got my car back on thursday and the tranny shifts like a dream now. Amen! I am soooo friggin' happy to have my own car back, you have no idea. The mechanic that did my tranny was nice enuff to bring it home for me, so I rode him back to his house. We were talking cars and stuff, and he said "I gotta show you what I have in my garage". Hmmmmm.....got my curiousity peaked??? So we pull in the drive, open the garage door, and there he has a Buick Grand National! Beautiful car, and  fast as hell  right from the factory. God it was a sight. I looked in the door and I saw a NOS sticker on the dash. "Hey, you run nitrous in this..no wonder it's as fast as you say", I told him. "Never used it" he said. "I'll bring it over in the summer and let you have it for a weeked....go cruise around a bit". "Are you nuts", I said in shock!!?? "Nah, No problem" he said kinda matter of fact like. I can't wait. Well, there it is. I'm becoming a "gear head" again, just like I was 25 years ago. Most women in their 40's have a career and take up hobbies like gardening, or painting or something. Not me, nah, I gotta take up auto mechanics and driving "Muscle Cars". And no this isn't some kind of "Mid-Life Crisis' bullshit. I just miss the grease under my nails and the excitement of a rumbling engine under the hood.........and this time it's gonna be mine all mine. And that makes it even sweeter.  Those that know me well, will just shake their heads and grin. Doesn't surprise 'em a bit.

      Well now this has been a special week for me. Monday was a Monday what can you say about that? Tuesday I had surgery. My son dropped me off.. then was late picking me up from it. Figures.. never count on your kids to be on time. After a brief nap I did the dishes and homework with son then went to bed for the nite. Wednesday I returned to work but by Wednesday nite the doc had me go to the emergency room as my lips are still numb from the gas they gave me. They rechecked me and said i just have what would be equivalent to a boxers lip. Like i got punched when i was under general. What the hell do they do to you when your sleeping like that? The inside of my lips were cut through by my teeth where they pressed the mask down on me so as a precaution they RX something so they dont get infected. Then to top of this... the emergency room had the balls to charge me.. and they are the ones that did this to me. They said the feeling should come back in a few days to see my reg. doc on friday.. another charge if i had done it.  By the next day i was on the phone and the big bosses at the hospital said they would make accomidations for me.. I have not heard another thing from them since thursday. Friday comes and i am still numb.. still working though.. trying to help out my Gateway Bosses.. so ok i go in still numb mouthed and am told that Gateway is closing all their remote sites.. I will be out of work as of March 3rd. So keep your eyes and ears open Krazy.. i be needin a job right quick. I have not told the other half yet. I dont want to see him happy yet. So now to end the week.. its Saturday nite and my mouth is still numb....and the hospital still has not called. Wonder just what they are planning to accomidate.........A new job would be nice. Something without sick people though.. i am not into sick!!!!  Well enough about my wonderful life.....hows yours going?

      Boy I am soooo glad that I don't start work till 2:30 tomorrow. Almost like having another day off. In fact when I go in tomorrow, I plan on turning in a couple of vacation days for the end of the month........all total I'll have a whole week off, (combining my 2 vacation days with my schedualed days off, equals 7 days total) Nice! Then, I still have 3 more to use before the end of June, when I get two weeks again. This past year, I managed to turn two weeks vacation into 4...thanks to the bosses allowing us to split up the days. See, they're only assholes 95% of the time.

      I ordered my first Corvette buyers guide online yesterday from  urlLink Corvette Central . It should arrive next week, and I can begin learning about what to look for in a good used Vette. I also bought a copy of Corvette and Chevy Trader magazine just to take a peek at whats out there, and what they are selling for. I want to get one with a 454 in it, but they aren't as easy to find as the 350's. Finding this "scream machine" may take a bit of effort, but hell yeah it's going to be so worth it!

      Well, I have some good news on the car scene. My New Yorker has been in the shop since Tuesday and Hubbs said that it will be done today. Great huh? Hell yeah....I want my ride back. Shit, I hardly had a chance to drive it, before it ended up in the shop for repairs. We didn't even have a chance to bond yet!!  At least now I know the tranny will be good to go for a long time. Hubbs let me take his car to work for two days, but I was a nervous wreck the whole time, 'cause he is very picky about how his car is driven. Can't say that I blame him, as his job requires him to do extensive driving. Anyway, I was a wreck the whole time I drove the damn thing. Then there's my sons truck. I drove that thing to work on  Monday, and talk about being nervous. That truck makes so many freakin' strange grinding noises, that I thought for sure I had ruined something, somewhere. Here he tells me, after I get home, that it does that shit all the time. Couldn't have told me about the things little neuroses before I left, huh? Nah. I can't wait to have my car back. Now you would think that this would be an easy task to accomplish. Well, probably in someone elses life it would be. But not in my dysfunctional little corner of the world. See, my son is off work tomorrow, so I ask him if he would ride me to get my car. Hell no...today is the one year anniversary of his auto accident. He's not leaving the house today.  So now I can't get my car today due to intense superstition. Only in my world I'll tell ya. I'll bet cha if it was his ride, we'd be out there picking it up  at the friggin' butt crack of dawn!  I'm getting pretty frustrated with the testosterone crowd in this place. 'Nuff said.

      Ah.... the pure bliss of vehicle ownership!  Not!  Seems my latest ride has developed some tranny problems, so I'm currently taking turns driving the guys vehicles. This is a royal pain in the ass.....for all of us. And it's gonna get even more frustrating on the days we all work.....I'll just have to drive mine and pray that I don't get stuck stranded on the road somewhere. The real problem lies in how I'm gonna get to work while the tranny is being re-built. Shit. I guess we'll figure it all out somehow.  Speaking of vehicles...only a couple more months 'till I get to shop for my "Vette". Now we're talkin' bliss!

       Another Year Older........Oh Yeah!!!  I must say I had a very nice birthday today. I switched shifts with a co-worker, so I was able to get out at 5 instead of 9.....nice! This afternoon, Joy and Ron hustled me off to a new Mexican restaurant near work, for a surprise b-day lunch!! It was yummy, and we all left very full...not only full of food....but gas as well!!! Lol! I thought that was such a sweet thing to do. Then I got home, and my "guys" sang "Happy Birthday" to me when I came in the door, and was greeted by a huge bunch of purple balloons, a cheesecake and a pretty gift bag!!! Wow......!!!  *Big smiles*  They got me a digital camera and a purple sports watch!  I was blown away, as I never expected the camera. I told Hubbs that I was gonna get myself one later in the year......so I  never  thought that he'd get me one today. I had given him a few small things on my wish list, and I really thought that's what I'd find in the bag. What a  sweetheart  he is! Indeed! If he installs the software for me tomorrow while I'm at work, I'll be putting photos on my web page in no time.This is gonna be fun! Hubbs also made a yummy spaghetti dinner, so I was able to take a little "nappy" after work. My brother and my folks called me this evening, and just hearing their voices is a wonderful gift in itself. And Amanda, the big hugs you gave me tonight are  priceless . Thank you. *smiles* A huge "Thank You" to everyone that made my birthday a day that I'll always remembar with joy in my heart. I am blessed to have such beautiful souls sharing this lifetime with me. I love you all. *Hugs*

      Well, another New Years Eve has come and gone, and as always I have way too much food! Oh well......yummies for later on today! I  love  New Years Day. Everything suddenly seems fresh, a new beginning. Not that this does me any good six months from now, but I always start the year with good intentions. I have learned one thing though.....I will not try to write a journal this year. I must have at least 6 of 'em started, (yeah, on New Years Day) that I never finish. Not gonna make that mistake this year. Well, I better hit the sheets.......gotta wok in the morning, and as it is, I'm going to be dragging my ass big time. I'll post more about our evening tomorrow. Oh, and a few of my resolutions too. You know.....the ones I never keep!!  Kidding....I  try . Peace in 2002. Nite.

      Thank goodness I'm finally starting to feel like myself again! The past two weeks have been pure hell on the work front, therefore the lack of posts here. first off, one of my co-workers was on vacation for 12 days and another ended up in the hospital for major surgery, leaving only three of us working for over a week. Not only did this mean endless running after customers, but no dinner hours and very few bathroom breaks to boot. It's tiring as  hell with 5 of us on the floor, but with three.......well it stretched us to our limits. Then last week I found out I lost a big sale due to an error made by one of the girls in the office. When I spoke to the ball-less asshole we loosely call our manager, he basically told me tuff beans, these things happen, get over it. And he really didn't give a shit about my customer, or the fact that she was rightfully upset about the whole ordeal.  Well, it literally made me ill to know that even though I can write a sale perfectly, I can lose it all at any time, and there are no resources to back me up. I cried, I was so upset. Not only did I lose money, but a current customer and a future one as well, as she was going to buy more things from me in the future.  I don't need this shit. I had to come home from work on Monday because I was feeling lousy, like I had the flu or something, but I truely believe that part of the reason I felt the way I did was due to the stress I felt from the lost sale incident. Well hopefully I won't have to deal with this bullshit much longer. Soooooooo...... my best  friend and I have been saying for a long time, that we should be in business together, and we came up with a  brilliant  idea the other day. And guess what? We're gonna persue it. Hell ya! Can't say much about it yet, as we don't believe there is anything out there like it, and we don't want anyone beating us to the punch. So till we have everything wrapped up legally, mums the word. Exciting indeed!  Turning lemons into lemonade we are!! Yup, yup!

      Ok, so I haven't posted in 10 days. Bite me. Sometimes real life happens while you're blogging. And although I do love sitting down and writing here, at times I just like to turn the ole brain off completely, and just veg out. No thoughts, no typing, nuthin' my friend. Brain silence. And then again, at times I just don't wanna replay my whole freakin' day again......it sucked the first time around, and the last thing I want to do is re-hash the whole damn thing all over again. Get it? Got it.     I think I'm kinda in a blog boredom phase here lately. (see I go through alot of phases. I'm kinda like the moon!) Anyway, even reading them lately has become a bore for me. They're all basically the same, in one manner or another. Just different layouts and graphics, opinions and links, photos and comments. After awhile though, they all blurr together in a whirl of html code and bullshit.  Like a big "journalist- wannabe" garbage disposal. Boring. This is boring.  I'm done venting. Nuff said.

      Once again, I've stayed up waaay too late, in a desperate effort to prolong my days off. Problem is, I'll sleep in late today, and probably drag my ass all afternoon. Hmmmmmm........actually, that doesn't sound like a bad idea. I was gonna bitch about wasting half the day, and yada, yada, but forget it. Dragging my lazy ass around, on a lazy Sunday afternoon sounds okey-dokey to me!

      Personally, I'm not much of an Olympics fanatic. I do enjoy the figure skating and the skiing, but I'm not gonna break into a sweat if I miss the stuff either. What I do want to say, is that the opening ceremonies are just awe inspiring, to say the least. I can't even imagine, in my wildest dreams, the planning and work that is involved in pulling off a spectacle of that magnitude. It was utterly magnificent! Bravo!  I'm done. I've used up all my big words for the day. Nite!

      I've been feeling helpless lately, and being a Capricorn, I don't do helpless well at all. See, we like to be in control of the situation at all times, and if & when we can't, it's a frustrating thing to us. I'm frustrated. See, my best friend is going through some really rough, life changing stuiff right now, and all I can do is offer support, and let her know that I'm there for her. She says it's enuff, I don't feel it is. I want to make everything okay, make the light at the end of the tunnel appear brighter....and closer.  She's as strong as steel, but right now she doesn't feel it. I want to make her feel strong. We've been on alot of "journeys" together, but this is a big one. And yeah, I'm there for the long haul, but I wish I could do more. More than just a phone call or visit. I want to snap my fingers and make things right, for this wonderful lady that only deserves the best that life has to offer. And the best will be hers....after the dust settles and the smoke clears. But trudging through the dust and smoke is a bitch, and sometimes because of the debris, you can't see the rainbow thats at the end of it all. I want to lead her to the rainbow. I know that we all have our own journeys to travel, and knowing that we have people that love us in our corner helps to carry us through. Been there. But I so wish there was more I could do.

      Wow did we get some major snow today! Normally, this would not even turn our heads here, but this winter has been so mild that when we do get dumped on we're like "what the hell"! My guys dug out the driveway, and cleaned off all our vehicles, so we're business as usual again. I cleaned the carpets today.......whoooohoooo! Damn were they bad! It feels so goods to have them smelling and looking clean again. I'll tell ya, when dogs get old, they stink to high heaven if you don't bathe them, like every other day. Ugh. Well, with the major cleaning job out of the way, tomorrow I chill. Cruise. Veg. Whatever you wanna call it. I'm so there. I've been working on my Klutter2 site for quite awhile now, and though it isn't as  fancy as alot of sites out there, I'm pretty happy with it. I'm sure I'll be changing it and updating it dozens of times before I'm really satisfied! Keeps me out of trouble, eh?

      Nuthin' much new here in La La Land....pretty much the same ole stuff.  Went back to work on Wednesday, and I gotta tell ya, it still sucks there. I thought that maybe after a week off, my perspective would change about the whole place. Nah, it still friggin' sucks. In fact, after some time off, it's even  more  noticable to me. I'm already trying to figure out when my next week off will be. Can you tell that my sanity revolves around the days I don't work? We all got called into the "wardens" office today, and got either write-ups or verbal warnings regarding our sales and warranty  figures.  My last warning was a  year  ago, in January, and the asshole asks me what the problem is and if there's any training he can offer me?  Shit, I had  one  low month in a friggin' year, and you're gonna make a big ass deal out of it? Get the hell away from me before I rip your head off! The pressure there is unreal. According to the "wardens", we sales people do no right, and are the root of all evil at the store. If it wasn't for the sales teams, they wouldn't have jobs. Assholes. Man I can't wait to start another day tomorrow!

I haven't had a good day to clean it up since I got it in November, so today's the day. Tonight I have to get all the Easter goodies wrapped up. I don't know if we're leaving tomorrow nite or Sunday. Either way, I need to get everything together.

      I would love to change my first name. I've thought about this for a long time now, and even though it would be a pain in the ass to change documents, credit cards, etc. it would be cool to have a first name that I really love and I got to pick. I always keep an ear open for unusual names. A couple I've heard recently, and really like are Rocque, (pronounced "rocky"), and Micha, (like mica). What do you think? Did you ever want another first name? If so, what would it be? Hmmmmm. Interesting. Let me know!

      Today went just as I planned it. My dentist visit was a breeze. I got a good cleaning, and he filled three little cavities along my front top teeth. Then I buzzed home and started on the guest room. I cleared everything out of there, and I must say it looks wonderful. Although I realized, we really do need to get a new mattress in there. Now that I sell mattresses, I know how crappy ours really is. Ugh. I feel sorry for our guests. I'm going to look at the ones we have at work when I go back, (ugh, don't wanna think about that now!), and see how much a decent one would run me. Just a thought. On the other hand. If I get a bed that's too comfy, they might want to stay longer. Hmmm. Should I get an extra firm?? Just another thought.  Lol! Then I got caught up on all the laundry. It was a very productive day indeed. So tomorrow is gonna be chill-out day for me. I think I deserve it!

      I was in vacation mode all day at work today. It was a pretty slow day, and it seemed to drag on forever...... I thought that 9 o'clock would never arrive. But of course it did, and here I am on the eve of a wonderful 7 day "all my time is mine" athon. Beautiful. I have a few things I do want to get accomplished around the house, but other than that, I'm gonna  enjoy  my freedom week.         I can't believe Easter is almost here!  It kinda snuck up on me this year. As a matter of fact, I still need to get out and pick up a few more items, and get them wrapped up. Usually I don't have much to take care of, but since we're probably going home to visit, I need to pick up a few extra goodies. Sometimes it seems like the errands  never    end!

      Man, I need to get some serious sleep tonight. I tossed and turned  all  damn night last night. It is sooo frustrating when that happens!  I almost dozed off this afternoon at work. Not a good thing to do on the sales floor, but we were very slow today, and that made it very easy to kinda nod off for a sec here and there. No biggie though. I just grabbed anpother cup of coffee and I was good to go untill closing. But now that I'm home and relaxed, it's really starting to hit me. Tomorrow's my last day of work for a whole week. I can't wait to get a bit done around the house, (hopefully outside), and finish up my Easter shopping. Well, I think I better hit the sheets and get rested up for tomorrow. With a bit of luck, and the right attitude, the day will go fast. Nitey night!  Zzzzzzzzzz

      Wow did I have a case of "cabin-fever" last night! I went to bed around 8:45 or so because I was feeling very frustrated, like there was nothing I wanted to do or watch on TV. I just wanted to shut my brain off. Shit I can't wait till all this friggin snow is outta here and I can get outside. I can't take looking at these walls any longer.  (Note to self: you wouldn't last very long in jail. Avoid at all cost.) Duh.

      Nuthin' really new around here today. Most of my excitement happens over on my Shark Attack page! Good news was that I started work late today, so the long morning was really nice. It was snowing like mad when I left this afternoon. It's a  good thing I gave myself a bit of extra time, because I got held up by an accident scene, then farther up the road, all the traffic lights were out at some major intersections. Needless to say, the traffic light problem slowed me up alot. One thing I have to say though, I was really surprised how courteous the drivers were of eachother at the problem lights. Everyone just took turns, which is a miracle if you knew how much traffic there is at these lights!  Anyway, I did get to work on time. I lucked out tonight, too. The weather was really bad around 7:30, so our boss decided to draw cards to see which two of us could leave early. Well, my card wasn't drawn, but Jeffery's was, and he let me go instead. He's such a gentleman, and has done this for me numerous times over the Winter. Thanks alot Jeff! Well, I do have to be up early tomorrow, but I get out at 5 so that's  really  a good thing! Nite all!

      I'm off work today, and it sure feels good to be at home and do as I please.  Problem is  that I have so much stuff that needs done around here, that my days off involve more work than my work days. Some days, I really think I need to hire a housekeeper to come in once a week, just to keep me on track, so I don't get so bogged down on my days off.  Years ago, I used to clean houses, and those women just loved me I'll tell ya. Now I know why. I have a  long way to go before I could ever let anyone in here to clean for me. Poor woman would have an anurism if she saw all the shit I have cluttering this place right now! Ugh. Well, I guess I've stalled enuff, and should get my butt in gear and just get started!

      Well, oh well. I called about a 76 Vette tonight, and guess what? A  decent  human being spoke to me!  A-friggin-men! This  lovely  woman, Judy, was not only nice to me, but she was  more  than accomodating when I asked her when I could take a look at the car. "Anytime", she said, "just let me know when you'd like to see it". Wow!  Simple. Easy. No bullshit. I actually found someone who wants to sell their car, and not put me throught he wringer to do it. We're gonna go see it on Wednesday. Needless to say, I can't wait!

      I'm having a real problem lately with people that have their cars for sale. I just don't get it. So far, out of the 4 people I've delt with,  all  of them have been a pain in the ass. First one, "Fucktard", wouldn't let me know the car was sold, even after I called him for 5 days, and he had already sold it on the first day. We'll just classify him under "asshole".  Second one, "Mr. Rochester" misled me by saying the car was in great, ready to drive condition. After a 3 hour drive to Rochester, the only place that "heap" was ready to drive to was the salvage yard. Classification: "dip shit". Third one, so far hasn't e-mailed me or phoned me with any info what-so-ever. No classification at this time. Fourth one, the "Market Gal". I call her today to ask if her car is still for sale from last year, and she gets this attitude like, "Well I'll have to let you know. I just had it worked on, and I put alot of money into it, soooooooooooo it won't be cheap." Did I say I wanted cheap?? I mean either you're selling it or not. If you are, give me the price and lets go from there.  Classification: Bitch. These people are unreal. I just wanna buy a car, plain and simple. I'm not asking for much here, just a bit of courtesy. If your car has sold, take the time to tell me. Send me an e-mail or put a message on the answering machine. No big effort involved there. If I ask what condition your car is in............don't lie. I'll figure out that you're lying when I see the car. And if I call and am interested in your car, don't treat me like I can't afford it. I wouldn't be looking if I couldn't afford the fucking thing. I have cash.........do you want it or not??  So as of right now, I'm still in limbo-land, still looking and calling. I just hope that sooner or later, (I hope sooner), I run into a nice person that will at least return my calls and be honest with me. I don't think that's too much to ask for.

Anyway, the vacation days I put in for were approved, so at the end of this month I'll have a wonderful 7 days off!  The beauty of it is, I only used 2 actual vacation days. I hope the weather is decent, so I can get outside and start some spring cleaning around the yard. I can't wait!

I'll post more about our day tomorrow, as I'm gonna go crash out now. I feel like I'm getting a bug or something. And don't worry, the saga continues.......... I already have a lead on another one!   But before I go off to beddie bye land..........a prayer.  "Now I lay me down to sleep; we told the clown, his Vette to keep. If it should sell, before I wake;  well some poor fool, made a  big  mistake"!  Amen.  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

      I should be asleep right now, as I have to be up early in the morning. But quite frankly, I'm way too excited and nervous to sleep. Excited at the prospect that I may be driving home in my dream car tomorrow..................nervous that I won't. I do not do well with shit like this. Not at all. See, I've waited 31 years for this day to arrive. 31 years.  Thirty-one years . Thats a long time to  want  something,  wait  for something,  dream  about something. My dream may be hours away from coming true..........or put on hold. The suspense is gnawing at my gut..........not knowing is driving me nuts here. God help me if this car turns out to be "the one". I'll probably have a nervous breakdown right there on the spot, and not even be able to drive home! But hopefully that will be the case. The alternative will make for a long ride home.

We should get there around noon or so, have some lunch, then start the inspection. With a bit of luck, I'll be driving home a happy, happy woman!

I was all prepared to hear the words "I can't", when I listened to the message on my machine. But my prayers were answered, and it's a go! I don't know if we're gonna fly or drive, but either way, we're  outta here  on Thursday morning. Now I just hope I'm not disappointed when I inspect the car. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Another hurdle. But one step closer!

      Well I have a line on yet another car. This one's in Rochester N.Y. I called the guy this afternoon, and he was very nice. He answered all my questions, and didn't treat me like I was a dumbass. I'm trying to set up a meeting to see the car ASAP, as I'm nervous someone is gonna scoop this one too. I don't know if my nerves can handle all this searching and drama that's involved. Hell, by the time I get my car, I'll have had a nervous breakdown and won't be competent to drive the fucker. Anyway, Hubbs said that he'd fly me up this week, weather permitting, and if Mike's work schedual permits. My driving bliss is fringing on too many factors lately. I don't like it.

      Vette Quest update #2- "Fuck-tard" sold the car, and didn't even have the courtesy to let me know. This is after I called for 5 days. I just chocked it up to experience, and now I'm looking at some others that have potential. I found one in Rochester that I'm gonna call about tomorrow. Hopefully, I wont find "Fuck-tard #2" on the other end of the line, eh?

      Update on "Vette Quest": Greg, who we will lovingly refer to as "fuck-tard", hasn't returned any of my calls as of yet. Kinda odd for someone who wants to sell a vehicle, and has an interested buyer anxiously waiting to see the car. I just don't get it. I was really upset about it last night, as this ride sounds just like what I'm looking for, and the price is right. Maybe this is an omen or something. Maybe he's just an asshole. He could at least have the courtesy to call me if it's been sold or he's changed his mind. Hubbs says I should let him call, as maybe the guy didn't take me seriously because I'm a woman. Man, that would be this guys first mistake!

      Wow! Long time, no post. Shit has been going down at work that you just wouldn't believe. Hopefully I'll be back on track, as I'm off for the next two days and I can do a bit of catching up.  On a happy note, gonna look at a 74 Vette tonight (if all works out as planned) and I'm really stoked about it! It sounds cherry, but I gotta see it to believe it. Keep your fingers crossed for me, okay?

      It's been awhile since I've posted.........I know. See, the problem is, everything that's exciting in my world right now, revolves around "baby", my Corvette. And all news pertaining to our adventures are on the Shark Attack page, therefore this page has experienced a "post-lag", so to speak. Hmmm, let's see. I had a great sales month in March.......just broke $56,000.00! Believe me, that doesn't happen very often in our store. Maybe a few times a year. Needless to say, I enjoyed the commission at months end. It was nice to get paid up on some bills, and still have a bit left over for fun stuff! Like they say, feast or famin..that's what my job is. I find it totally un-nerving at times.   My uncle Stanley died the other day. It's kinda wierd, because I've only met him once, as he lived in California. He was my Dads younger brother. I feel bad for my Dad, because his brother was so far away, they didn't really have any contact for years, and I know he feels bad about that. When his Mom passed away it was the same senario. Must be really hard to have your whole family live on the other side of the country. I find it hard to be away from my family sometimes, and mine are only 2 hours away. My uncle lived a hard life...I hope he's at peace and happy now.

      Today was a long ass day. In fact, lately, they've all been long ass days. No business to speak of, makes every hour seem like two. The great news is after tomorrow, I'm off for three days, and heading south on Sunday night to visit my folks for a bit.  I  need  a small getaway, if only overnight. I  need  a change of scenery......... bad !  So I"ll hit the road, just cruise and unwind a bit, and have a nice visit with Mum and Dad, alone.  Nice . I hope to go to lunch with them at the fire hall on Monday,  and meet all the friends that they're always talking about. Other than that, I'll be happy to just chill on their deck with a cold drink, bullshit the day away, and just enjoy their company.  One more tortureous day of work to go.  Gotta hit the sheets. Nite!

      Thank God I made it back! I thought I was gonna be gone forever..or at least it seemed that way! Anyway, my 'puter had a major nervous breakdown of sorts. A few viruses got through, and wreaked major havoc on my hard drive. Shit. Hubbs tried all kinds of things to get me back and rolling again, but in the end, had to get another hard drive, using my old one as a storage area for the time being. He's still trying to get me completely set up, but in the mean time, I at least have access again.  Along with complete virus protection this time! Don't have to tell me twice. He's put soooo much time into getting this bullshit straightened out for me.......a zillion thanks go out to him. I couldn't do it on my own. Hell no. It's good to have a crew. Real good.  P e a c e .

      Alas! A beautiful day before me, and I have so many things to do, I just don't know where to begin. Damn. All that needs done is inside the house. You see, I live with slobs and the cleaning seems neverending. Lately, it's all beginning to get to me.....working full time and trying to keep up with this house work crap. I'm gonna have to have a serious talk with the guys, and set down some major rules. It's just not fair that I get stuck with all the mess 24/7.

      I blew out of "the grind" an hour early tonight, and with two lovely days off before me, I be feelin' fine. Indeed. Best of all, they're supposed to be two decent days, weather wise. Finally! I got the title to my Vette in the mail yesterday and I'm hoping that my sticker won't be far behind. I'd like to know what moron decided that we shoud ride around for months with an ugly piece of paper taped to our back windows, untill we get our stickers for our plate. I can't stand to look at the thing anymore, and I run in the house like a little kid everyday to see if the friggin' sticker arrived yet. This is plain stupid. I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds this ridiculous. I mean shit, it's been two months already. Are they engraving it by hand? Idiots. I was a Gabes on my dinner break today, and they had some really neat make-up and nail polish there. So I checked it all out, finally deciding to get a bottle of polish, in a pretty watermellony shade of well..........sparkly watermelon. Tonight I'm putting the polish on, and no matter how many coats I put on, the shit keeps getting LIGHTER!  I'm thinking, am I nuts or what?? Well here I look at the name on the bottle, and it's a "mood" nail polish, and it changes from dark to light, in heat and cold. Great. So if I want to see the color that I originally bought it for, I have to keep my hands under cold running water. How convenient. Nite!

      I hope everyone had a good start to the week! My day seemed to drag on forever, but it's over now, and I'm so happy to be home and kick my shoes off! On my commute to the "Grind" this morning, I heard my new favorite song, "Feelin' hella good" on the the radio. I'll tell ya, I really like that song! Had my feet tappin', and my head bobbing up and down!  I really like the video, too.  God I would love to look like Gwen Steffani, if only for a day. Really. Okay..........maybe two days.  A week. That's it, just a week and I'd be satisfied. Really. Well I have to do the dishes then hit the sheets. Sweet dreams all. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

      I must say I'm still pretty happy about this page. It's nuthin' fancy by any means, but at least it's neat and uncluttered. Neat and uncluttered is another way for me to say that I have no talent what-so-ever to do anything fancy! I'm trying to come up with a new name and concept for my page, as this did start out to be a "group blog", but now it's turned into a solo act, much to my dismay. Another problem I have is that I don't have time to sit down and write everyday. Ugh. So I need to be able to put short thoughts down, without going into alot of detail. I dunno. So pleasr bear with me as I go through yet another transition. But that's what lifes all about. Changes.

New name, new concept, the works. Please bear with me, because my web design skills are just as suck-ass as before. So, for the 2 or 3 of you out there that ocasionally read this stuff, thank you for bearing with me, the incompetent one. Peace.

      Totally exhausted, I come here to try to write something worth reading. Nothing resides inside my head except, "Damn, I'm glad to be off work for the next two days." Nuff said. Hey, the way I figure it, if you want great, inspirational writing, better head out to Barnes and Noble, cause it just aint happenin' here folks. At least not tonight, anyway. My bones are tired, my brain is mushy, and my spirit is weary. Nuthin' that a couple of "brain-dead days" won't cure. I think I'm gonna head to the sheets now. Let the "cure" begin. Peace.

      I am a "Blog-slacker"...........yes I am. Not that I haven't had anything to write about mind you, I just haven't really given much thought to "blogging" lately. I was sick for a week, had company for four days, just finished up a "7 day stretch" at work, and in my free time, I take "Baby" out for a drive. My house has gone to shit, I haven't even started on my gardens yet, and half the time I'm lucky if I get the laundry done and get my ass to work every day. I'm finally off today, and I'm torn between getting things done around here. or just chillin' and giving myself a well deserved day of R&R. Now Hubbs wouldn't even have a problem in this area. He'd just head off to the golf course, and that would be that!  Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. I wonder if waxing my car qualifies as getting something done around here? Guilt ensues. Ugh.

      I can't believe I got up and stayed up this morning, as I don't have to be at work till 2:30. Hmmmm. Hubbs made a hell of alot of noise this morning, waking me from a blissful sleep. I think he enjoys doing that to me.  Then Jr's alarm went off, so I got his breakfast stuff together, and off he went. By this time I was wide awake, so here I am. I had some nice news yesterday. My sister-in-law Debbie e-mailed me that she and my neice Jackie are going to be in our area over the weekend, and they are gonna try to visit us while they're up here. Nice! I hope we can work out a time frame for them to come over for a bit, as I work till 5 on Friday. It will be so great to see them for awhile! I'm excited!

      Well, another day of testing is over with............Amen. Yesterday, I went and had blood drawn for a series of tests I'm having done, due to that chest pain incident I had last week. No problem, except that it was a "fasting" test, which means no food or drink after midnight the night before. Really not a biggie, except that I'm a zombie without my morning java, and it was a bit rough getting the engines started, if you know what I mean. Now today was even more of a bitch, as I had to drive farther, and be there earlier than yesterday. Shit. I swear I was half asleep on my way there, which is a scary thought, considering I was on the interstate. Well they did an ultrasound on my gallbladder, to see if there's been any change in the stone I have floating around in there. They're guessing that I might have had a gallbladder attack on Monday. I guess we'll see. Luckily, I was outta there in no time, and I had brought a thermos of coffee with me, (good thinking huh?), so I'd have an instant fix as soon as I was done. Now here I am, in my car in the parking lot, pouring my coffee into my mug, and this "parking lot guy" is like motioning for me to hurry and pull out, as someone was waiting to get into my spot. Now let me interject that there were at least 15 or more spots in this lot, but "parking lot guy" takes his job  very seriously  and wants everyone to hustle along as soon as their ass hits the seat of the car. Well I thought, "fuck you, you idiot, I've been deprived of my coffee all morning, this is currently  my  spot, and I'm gonna sit here 'till either I get a sip of my coffee or Hell freezes over, you choose". I wish he would have said something to me, cause I was crazed, under-caffinated, and not in the mood to dick around with a parking lot attendant with an attitude. I swear I woulda cracked him a good one. Well, needless to say there were no confrontations, but I did get a few good sips of my coffee before leaving, he leered at me, I rolled my eyes and I was on my way. Nothing too exciting the rest of the day. God it was hot as hell today!  Me and 90 friggin' degrees are not friends. I was really glad to get into the house, and pay homage to the wonderful air conditioner!

      Today was one long ass boring day at work.  Add to that, the fact that I felt like shit all day. I have this damn cold, and it's really making me miserable, and edgy. I don't like feeling this way at all. As I was driving home tonight, I thought to myself what a beautiful night for just cruising around. Just perfect. I seriously thought about taking "Baby" out for a spin around, but going alone isn't really much fun. Man I had the itch though. Damn.

      I took off work today, and it was a good thing I did. I called the doctors office to get an appt. for my ear ache, and they said they had a slot for me in 15 minutes. I'll be there!  Anyway, ear checked out ok, just a clogged tube or something, no biggie. Well, while I was there, I mentioned my incident yesterday, and they decided to set me up with some blood work on Monday, and a sonogram of my gallbladder on Tuesday, suspecting that I might have had a gallbladder attack. I do have a stone in there, but last time I had it checked, there wasn't any reason for concern. Maybe it moved or something.....we'll see on Tuesday. They also gave me an EKG, which read ok. (big relief there) So I feel alot better today, knowing that I'm on the road to getting all this shit figured out. Mid-life bullshit I'll tell ya.  Bites.

      Well I had one hell of a scare at work yesterday. Around 1pm or so, I got some pains in my chest that brought me to my knees. Damn they were wicked. Joy, my wonderful co-worker and friend, did everything she possibly could to make me comfortable, and help me any way she could. I didn't know what to do, I was freakin' out. (she asked if I needed to go to the hospital, but being a chicken-shit, I said no) I went into the bathroom and layed on the floor, then I went to the recliner isle and stretched out on a recliner for a bit. This was much more comfortable for me, but it was akward as all hell being in a furniture show room with customers strolling by. At the time I didn't care, as at least I was more comfortable than on the bathroom floor. Finally I asked if I could recline in Joys car for a bit, as I had my Vette and that was out of the question. Boss said yeah, Joy said yeah, so out we went to her car, where she opened the windows for me and I reclined the seat. This felt great for awhile........the pain was subsiding, but I was feeling waves of nausea from time to time. My mindset was to head to the bushes if need be. The whole time I felt very out of control because I was at work and away from the comforts of home. Finally I decided that I had to make a break for it and head home. Come hell or high water, I was gonna get my ass home! So I staggered in and told the boss, "I'm outta here", got my stuff and headed out to the car. I threw my shoes in the car, ripped off my jacket, and hit the road. I don't even remember driving at all..........just pulling in the drive, dashing in the house and right into bed. By this time I was feeling better, but I needed to sleep. Thank god, after 4 hours of hell, the pain was gone. I was home. God I thought I was gonna die in a furniture store. Thank goodness for my friends.

       I brought Laurels ashes home today. It was a bitter sweet experience.  It was very hard to go to the Vets, and have them hand me a small white box. I went in with a dog, and left with a box. I drove her home in my 'Vette, and I drove slowly, in silence, as a tribute to my old friend on her last ride. I opened the box in the house, and was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful "urn" they had put her ashes in. It's a beautiful pottery piece, highly glazed, with muted colors of blues and browns. Very pretty. They were also kind enough to include a nice card with her paw print on the front, a beautiful verse inside, and a tiny bag of her fur. I put everything on our buffet, along with her photo, and her favorite ball..........amongst our family photos. She was indeed family. The circle is complete. My girl is home.

      Well, I'm back. Still getting over not having my furry friend around, but it's getting better everyday. I'm still waiting for the vet to call me so I can go and pick up her ashes and bring them home. Then the cycle will be complete. My parents were up for a few days, and we had a really nice visit. We celebrated Hubbies birthday on Sunday with a steak dinner and lots of gifts. On Monday, I went with my Mom to Agway and got all the plants for our veggie garden, then up to Scotland Yard Nursery for some flowers and herbs. My Dad went golfing with Hubby, so they were enjoying the morning in their "guy" way, while Mom and I had our own fun!. To be continued........

       In Memory of our beloved Laurel........Gone but never to be forgotten   December ?, 1986 - June 4, 2002   Today is a very sad day for me. For all of our family. We said goodbye to our furry family member and best friend, Laurel. She was very special to us. To me. To let her go today, was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, even though I know it was for the best. Knowing it was for the best doesn't make it any easier, though. My heart is broken. I miss my friend. Rest in peace my baby girl. I (we) love you.

        I'm awake and moving, with lots to do before I head out later in the afternoon. I have to keep moving along  towards getting things together, as thoughts in my head keep saying to stay home and get stuff done around here. Sometimes being a Capricorn is tuff, as I always seem to want to do the "practical" things and not the fun stuff. Like no play till the work is done. Well I figure the work is  never  done, so hell with it! I'm outta here after dinner! Adios!

      I know it's late, as I have to be up at 5:00 in the morning, but I just can't sleep yet. I thought maybe typing for awhile would make my eyes tired and then I'd want to crash out. Or not. I think I'm just trying to drag out the evening as long as possible, so morning will take longer to get here. I don't want to go in the morning at all. I have had all my parts and pieces  for all these years, and I'm not thrilled about   having one of them taken out, even if it is bad. A part of me just wants to jump in my Vettester and head anywhere.......fast!  The other part of me just wants to get it over with, and get back home to my comfy bed. Better hide the Vette keys.............just in case! Just kidding. Oh oh, it's midnight now. No more drinks or eats for me. :O(  Next meal will be hospital grub................yum!   Wish me luck, eh? Nite. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  (I hope)

      I talked to my Mom this morning, and she said that she totally understands my not wanting them to come up, as I will be in the guest room for a couple of days, and Nick will have everything taken care of. Phew......................that's a  load  off my mind. I was soooooo afraid that her feelings were gonna be hurt, and she'd be upset. I'll never figure that woman out. Anyway, one less thing to worry about.

      Well I found out this morning that my surgery is at 7:45am tomorrow, and that I have to be there at 6am. Ugh. Good thing is that I'm the first operation of the day, so hopefully my doctor will be fresh as a daisy when I roll in. God I hope he's not a drinker and hungover. *shudders* I'm a tad bit nervous today, but I've been so busy around here getting things ready, that I haven't had much time to think about it.

      The picnic at Ed's house was really nice, despite the threatening weather we were having when we left home. Up at his place, it wasn't raining at all, which was a nice surprise. We all just sat on their deck, bullshitting and eating. Very relaxed and easy going type get-together, which was nice. I'm really not a big party person, so I didn't know how this was gonna turn out, but it was a super nice time. There were only 10 of us, so it was easy to talk. Only problem for me was that I couldn't eat any of the delicious ranch dip they servrd with the veggies. See, I luv ranch dressing. Oh well. Twas not to be, for me.

      Nick and I are going to a picnic at Ed's (one of my co-workers) house today. Should be nice, if it ever stops raining. I made a pineapple upsidedown cake last night, and I must say it looks really good! Of course the way I've been eating lately, everything looks really good to me.

      I have two new obsessions. Self-tanning and hair removal. Not only do I have Nair, but also Neet and shave gel, and I'm also looking to find that new Veet stuff. I think it's just a phase. I dunno.

      I have been in a pretty great frame of mind lately, and no it's not because of the Vicodin I took last night. I have been losing quite a bit of weight due to my gallbladder attack in late June. See I haven't been eating anything greasy or fatty, and I've really cut down on my sugar consumption too. Well, it's really beginning to show, and I'm enjoying every minute of this shit, I'll telll ya! Hell ya. I've wanted to lose weight ever since I had Nick, (almost 20 years ago!!), but till now I never really had the motivation to do so. Well, if having pain in your chest that's so intense that it feels like a heart attack, and lasts for 4 hours isn't motivation..........I don't know what the hell would be. Nuff said. If I never eat that stuff again it'll be too soon. Anyway, everyone at work is like freaked out by how good I'm starting to look, and I must say I feel better too. And my co-workers are starting to work out, and watch what they eat, so it makes me feel good to be sort of a motivating factor for them. See, take a bad situation and turn it into something good. This is what we are doing.

      I went to the hospital this morning for my pre-op testing. The two worst parts of the ordeal were, no coffee and finding a parking spot. I ended up parking in the lot, and luckily I had just enuff quarters to cover my time there. The testing part wasn't bad at all......answered a few health questions, had a chest x-ray, and gave a bit of blood. The woman that drew the blood samples was fantastic...............I didn't even know the needle was in my hand. Yeah, they have to take it from my hand because the veins are too deep in my arm, and no one ever gets to them without causing me alot of pain, and me wanting to punch them in the face for hurting me. The only part that got to me a bit, (alot), was when the gal that was talking to me about the anestesia, told me that they would be putting a tube down my throat to help me breathe, but I would be asleep when they did.  Whoopteeshit . I don't want a friggin' tube down my throat................ ever !  Asleep or not.  I'm not happy about this at all. After all that, I went and had a root canal. Hopefully my tooth will stop driving me nuts now. Fun morning, huh?

      Here we go again kiddies.............I managed to screw up the 'puter  again . Friggin' screensavers. I swear I'll never, ever download another one again. F'n smack me silly if I do, ok?  The damn thing didn't cause any problems when it ran............only after I un-installed it. (The real bitch is that I didn't even  like  the damn screensaver!)  Now, even though I can still use the pc, it does odd shit that it didn't do before. I don't think it's a bug, as I did a complete system virus scan, and it came up negative. Just enuff bullshit to piss me off ya know? Just enuff.

      Well, I made it to the  suck-ass  meeting at 9 am this morning. The bosses just think it's so friggin' cute that they can drag us in on our day off, and brow beat us for a half an hour in the name of "training".  Bite me .  Anyhow, with that out of the way, I can now figure what I'm gonna do with the rest of my day. I don't know if my brother-in-law and his family are gonna be up tomorrow or not. If they are, I have to clean out the guest room  pronto . If not, well then I can kinda chill all day, except for getting my stuff ready for work this week. I hope I hear from someone, soon so I know what the hell to do.   Yesterday I went to the Library, to see if they had any Pilates books I could borrow, instead of ordering them from my bookclub. I don't want to get stuck with books if they suck. Well they didn't have them at our branch, so they're having them brought in from the main library. Should be here today, I hope. I've been losing alot of weight, but I need to tone up too, and I've heard that the Pilates workout is very good for toning and aiding in flexibility. I'll give it a shot and see if I notice any good results. While I was at the library, I realized that it had been sooooooo long since I'd used the damn thing, that I had  forgotten  how to use it!!! Like, are things listed by Author or title? I felt like a real dumbass, but a sweet woman there said she completely understood. I'd bet money that she called me a "dumbass" when I left. That's okay. As  long as she gets my books, I don't care what she thinks about me.

      I am soooo happy to be off for two days! Sometimes I think we need two days off for every two worked, it just sucks so bad there anymore. Anyway, enuff talk about the "Grind" for now. I am sleeping in tomorrow,  no matter what , and I am not going to let anyone or anything, (excluding maybe a house fire!), get me out of bed until I want to get out. And that's that!!  See, my attempts to sleep in have been thwarted by one thing or another over the past few weeks, and over the next few weeks, I'm not going to have any mornings off,  that I don't either have an appointment or a meeting of some sort. Sleeping late is my one true pleasure........I adore it. So everyone around here has been warned not to wake me. Won't be pretty if they do.

      My day was uneventful, except for when my tooth went ape shit on me for awhile, and I was in so much pain that I wanted to hack my head off. I resolved the problem, and the rest of the evening was a breeze. Amen. Now all I need to do is pack, shower and hit the sheets. We're leaving at 10 in the morning, and I don't want to be draggin' my ass all day, so I'm gonna get a good nights sleep. We should have a nice visit, as the weather is going to be great, and I'm looking forward to seeing everyone at the reunion. Nite!

      I should be in bed right now, but seeing as I don't have to be at work till 2:30, I'm pushing it a bit. Yesterday kinda sucked from the get-go. I woke up with the whole left side of my face swollen from my damn tooth. Beautiful. Good news is that I wasn't in as much pain as I was Wednesday night. I can't stand the pain. Anyway, I got alot of stuff done today, and hopefully all I have to do to tonight is pack and wrap up a few loose ends. Then it's off to the reunion on Saturday morning. Nite.....pain pill kicking in!

      I have an abcessed tooth. Left side of face is swollen and throbbing, even though I saw the Dentist this morning, and he opened the tooth up to drain, and gave me antibiotics. Damn I hate this shit..........it ruined my whole day off. I just took some more pain meds, grabbed the ice bag, and I'm going to bed. Hopefully by morning, the antibiotics will have kicked in and the swelling will have gone down. Damn it. I look like a freak. :O(   (LIke Goldie Hawn in The First Wives Club, after she had that terrible botox "lip job"!)

      Well, I went to the consultation yesterday, and yes, the "S" word was used. Surgery. The ole Gallbladder gotta go. Deep inside I knew it, but I didn't want to hear it. August 1st is the big day, and our 21st Wedding Anniversary to boot. I guess I'll never forget this coming anniversary, huh? Anyway, the date is set, now all I have to do is some preliminary tests in a week or so. I'm a bit nervous about the whole ordeal, mostly because of  surgery horror stories you always hear about. I know, I'm dramatic at times, but I heard about these people that when they were put under, they still felt all the pain from the surgery, but they couldn't move or speak to alert anyone! Now wouldn't that be a bitch? Shit. Anyhow, I'm gonna try not to dwell on it. But I am nervous. I am. Sissy me.

      Well, today at Noon, I have to go for a consultation with a surgeon about my friggin' Gallbladder, and I'm not too excited about this stuff  at all . I'm a bit nervous, but I'm not gonna get all whacked about it............yet. Part of me is anxious to get this all over with, as I'm really scared to have another attack. But another part of me doesn't want to hear the word "surgery", as I haven't had an operation since I was about 5 or so, and had my tonsils removed. I puked. I remember  that . I never heard of the Doctor that they referred me to, so I don't even know who I'm seeing today. No matter how I look at this, it bites. I guess I just have to go and see what he has to say.

      Tonight , I came home from work hot, sticky, miserable, with a throbbing headache and a stiff neck. Work was so friggin' hot that the customers were even commenting about it. By 8pm I had all I could take of the bullshit. I need to dig up something cool to wear tomorrow, and I really don't feel like doing anything right now, but taking a cool shower and hitting the sheets. Not to be though.......gotta get a few things done before I reach that point. Shit.

      My Sis-in-law Deb and my niece Jackie did come up for the weekend, and it was sooo nice to be able to spend a bit of time with them. Yesterday, they came over the house around 6 or so, and we just sat outside on the patio and chatted about anything and everything. Very relaxing and enjoyable. It is so nice when you have people visit, that just go with the flow, sit back and chill for awhile and share a few laughs. They headed back to their hotel around 8:30 or so, as they were pooped from riding bikes around the Penninsula, and swimming. When they were leaving, we made loose plans to meet today to do some shopping. Deb called me this morning, ( they slept in just like I did!), and we decided to meet at 2 to do a bit of browsing and bullshitting. We met up, and shopped for about an hour, then decided to go eat at Paneras Breads. Goooood lunch! We all had the soup, sandwhich, salad deal, and just chatted and laughed like the loons we are! I guess we were ther around an hour. when they figured it was time to hit the road. We said our "good-byes" and they were on their way home. A short, but wonderful visit. I really wish we lived  closer to eachother so that we could do things like that more often.  *sigh*  Well, I guess it's off to bed for me, as I have a long ass day to get thru tomorrow, and I'm worthless if I'm tired. Off to dreamland! Nite!

      Damn I'm tired. These 7 day stretches are killers, I'll tell ya, and the fact that 3 people have been fired over stupid crap, only adds more tension to the whole thing. Thankfully I (we)  only have three more days to grind through. I feel like the group cheerleader right now, trying to keep everyopns spirits up, and keep 'em all motivated. Not an easy task at this point in time. I'm mentally fried! Help!

      All work and no play = no blogging! Oops. Nuthin' much new in La La Land anyway.........hmmmmmm lemme see.........this past week has been interesting at work. We got a new guy, Jacob, on our team, which thrills us to no end, as we haven't enuff business for the 5 of us, let alone one more. Anyway, Jacob is 54 and is from Liberia. Needless to say, we can't understand a freakin' thing he says. We just nod alot or keep saying "huh?" like a bunch of morons. He also says he's a preacher, so he can't work any Sundays. I can't wait to see how the boss handles this shit. If he gives this guy Sundays off, royal hell is gonna break loose. So things have been a bit interesting on the sales floor with the "new blood" around. I don't think he's going to last very long. Most don't in our neck of the woods.   Tomorrow, Hubbs and I are going to Ron's (a fellow salesman), for a  picnic at his trailor by the lake. The guys are going to go golfing, while us gals bullshit and treasure hunt on the beach! I think it will be a nice time for everyone, with lots of good food and strange characters! I love it! And yes, I am one of those strange characters!

      Wow! It's been awhile since I've been here. Healing myself after surgery has been priority one, so this took a bit of a back seat. Let's bring things up to speed, shall we?  Friday August 9   Saw the doctor in the afternoon, and he took off my little steri-strips, and gave me two "thumbs up" on my progress. Great. Off to work for 6 hours, my first day back in over a week. It was really nice when I walked in the door at work, everyone saying they missed me, and were glad to see me back. Nice to be missed and needed. Needless to say it made me feel wonderful! The day was okay, although as I got toward evening, my stomach began to cramp up a bit. Uncomfortable, but I can deal with it. It's just letting me know that there's still mending going on in  there. Easy does it, now.   Saturday August 10  Headed off to work in the morning for a 7 hour day. Nothing to eventful to report about my day, my sales were shit, and by 5, I was ready to head home for three days of R&R.   Sunday August 11 What a wonderful way to start the day........sleeping in till 11, then Hubbs made us all pancakes that were soooooo yummy! Nick and I rode up to Erie to get him some new shoes. We found one pair at Value city Dept. Store and one at DSW Warehouse. I think he was happy with what he found, and I was happy to spend some time with him. Later in the day, I took the "Vettester" out for a couple of drives, and then just chilled out at the house the rest of the day. Great Sunday indeed!   Monday August 12  I saw a neat little CD boombox in a Circuit City ad in the Sunday paper, so I decided to drive up and get one. I picked one up, drove home, and the freakin' remote didn't work. Shit I was pissed, as now I'd have to drive back up there and get another one. Now it's not that it's a long drive, about 15 minutes is all, but I wasn't in the mood to waste my time going back where I just was. I have better things to do on my day off. well, I packed it all up, and headed back to the store. This time I had the chick there test it out for me, and she was really nice about the whole thing. As I headed out, I thought I hadn't been to Platos closet for awhile, so I stopped in and found two really sharp tops for $5.00 each! I love this bargain shopping shit. It's like a friggin' drug to me! Then I drove over to Nicks work, but he was busy in the stock room and I didn't want to bother him. So I told his boss to tell him that I'd stopped by, and I was outta there.  Well, since I was next to a Fashion Bug, I thought what the hell, pop in and see what they have to tempt me with. I found a cut pair of seersucker pants 50% off, so they were only like $3.75 or something, and I found two colognes I liked, and they were only 2/$10.00! Yeeeha! Jackpot again! Well, after all this I haeded home as I was starving. I ate a mac and cheese dinner, put on my new lounge pants, and spritzed on a bit of my new cologne. Oh, and a bit of cool jazz on the boombox..........life sure is good. Nuff said

      Better day today. I'm starting to feel more like "myself", with a tad bit more energy than I've had in a while. Yesterday was not a good day  at all . I felt like my guts went two rounds with a heavyweight boxer, and yeah, he won.............big time!  Then I had a squabble with my "caregiver" in the evening. Glad that's over with. It's such a gorgeous day out today, in the mid 70's, that I was able to enjoy being outside in my gardens for awhile. Nice. It really lifted my spirits to be outside on such a splendid day, with the sky a caribbean blue, dotted with whispy white clouds. Life is good.

      Well I'm home. Actually, I've been home since Friday morning, but this is the first time I've really felt like sitting here and writing. Everything went well surgically, and one nite in the hospital was more than enuff for me. I hated it, and there was no way they were even gonna think of keeping me another day. Now that I'm home, I mostly take my pain  meds and sleep, and walk around the house a bit. But I am feeling better every day. It's just good to be home.

      Work went well today. We had a steady customer flow, and I wrote a couple of nice deals, which made me a happy camper. Right now my mind is on next week, when I'll have almost a week off. I'll actually have six days off, but that's fine with me! The following weekend, we (Hubbs, Nick, Amanda and myself)  go to New York City for my nephews wedding. So I'll have two lovely weekends without bullshit! It just doesn't get any better than this, folks!  *does the happy dance*

      I gotta tell ya, I had a really nice time on my little getaway, and I got the impression that my parents enjoyed themselves as well. The drive down was really relaxing, and the Vettester ran like a dream. She sure loves the highway! I got in around 3:15, and we had coffee and talked awhile. My Mom told me that if I didn't mind, we were going out to my Aunt Pats house for a visit. Hell I didn't mind at all, as I haven't seen her since last year at NIcks graduation party. We discussed dinner, and decided that we were going to eat out at Old Country Buffet, which is up near my Aunts house. Dinner was good, and I made a second plate, which I haven't done for months. I skipped dessert though, and it was a bit rough going, as my Mom had a wonderful piece of cheesecake for her dessert, and it was hard for me not to go and get myself a piece too. But I hung tough, and went outside for a smoke instead. We went into a few small shops in the plaza there, which was nice. We drove over to my Aunts house, and when we went in, she screamed, "Barbie!", and gave me a huge hug and kiss! Wow, that was nice. We visited for about 2 hours or so, then drove back to my folks place, where I hit the sheets around 11:30, exhausted from going to bed too late the night before.   On Thursday, I got up at 9A.M., as we had to be at the fire hall by 10:30 for lunch set -up. My folks belong to a seniors group that has their lunches every weekday at the fire hall, and when I'm in for a visit, I love to go have lunch with them. They are all so sweet, and very entertaining! The only thing is, the meals are mediocre to say the least, but I eat it all, smile and say it was great anyway. I figure it wouldn't be very nice to say, "damn, lunch sucked again!" For some of them, it's probably the best thing they eat all day. Well, we left there around 12:30 and headed to a re-sale shop a few minutes away, where we browsed and had a nice time looking at some pretty decent things, I must say. I ended up buying a nice black and white houndstooth print skirt, (brand new with tag still on!) for $2.00, and a cool pair of earrings. My Mom got a pretty heart bracelet and Dad came away with a pair of dress slacks. A nice time, and I didn't spend alot of ching. ( I wore the skirt to work today, and it looked great!) We headed back to the house after about an hour in the shop, and just kinda got my things together and gabbed a bit more. I was pissed because it was raining and it just wouldn't let up at all. Shit. Well, I headed for home at 4:15 P.M., driving in the rain till I was almost half way here. By the time I got home, my car was almost dry, (thanks to a good wax job, that water just blew off!), so I didn't have to wipe her down when I got in. Amen for that, because I was a bit "road weary" and just wanted to unwind a bit before doing laundry and getting things ready for work today. I had a really nice time, and I'm so glad that I made up my mind to just do it. I need to do this sort of thing more often.

      You know how every once in awhile, we have those days where everything seems out of our control, and no matter how hard we try, it just doesn't get any better? Well, I've had  two of those days in a row , and thank god I'm off tomorrow. And my solution to keeping my sanity, (or what little I have left), is to get the hell out of Dodge. Yupper, I figure a little road trip will do the old psyche alot of good, so I'm heading down south to pay Mom and Dad a little visit. Short and sweet.......long enuff to be enjoyable,  but short enuff as not to cause further brain damage. Just me and the Vettester and the open road....... sweet . I'll be back thursday.

      I know I'm gonna pay big time tomorrow for staying up so late, but as I was flicking channels earlier, I came upon  urlLink Disturbed  live at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. I've never seen them live, so I was glued to the set for the last half hour or so. Damn they put on one hell of a good show. The lead singers voice is just mezmerizing to me. Very talented group. I like!

      I really enjoyed having the day off today. I slept in 'till 11, then got myself together to go out and spruce up my cars a bit. I swept out the New Yorker, dusted and polished a bit, and I must admit, it looks 100% better with minimal effort on my part. Then I Tackled the Vette with some detail spray, window cleaner and Armor All. I gave her a good sweeping, and she was all prettied up. Hubbs and I were gonna go for a little cruise, but it turned ugly dark, and started to rain. Needless to say, we'll have to go some other time. :( Right now I'm kinda beat, so I think I might take a little nappie poo.

      Well, I met with Diane on Thursday, and I'm officially selling Avon again. Love it! In fact, I got my first order from Donna at work today. Only problem is, the office manager, Michelle, told me to keep my Avon stuff on the "down low" from the boss, because he wasn't happy that the office girls had brought in some kind of garden party stuff. Whatever. I just told all the ladies to keep the books hidden, so I don't get my ass in a wringer, and put a damper on things. Hopefully, I won't get "found out", and this will all work out wonderfully, as planned.   I'm pretty happy to be off work today. I mean it's my first Sunday off in 4 weeks! I hope it's decent out, as I want to give my cars a good cleaning. Especially the New Yorker, as I've pretty much ignored it all summer, and it shows! I did take it to the shop on Thursday as planned, and Dave was nice enuff to weld the exhaust pipe for me so it don't sound like a ghetto car anymore. Amen to that! I was tired of getting those "fix your car" looks from people. Although I just gave em the"mind your own fuckin' business" look right back. Works for me. Nite.

      Yesterday went by in a blurr. I hate that, because I long for my days off, and when they kinda just fly by, it annoys the hell out of me. Diane, the Avon district manager called me yesterday, and I'm meeting her at Perkins today to get my ass signed up to sell again. I also put the bug in her ear that I want to do alot more than just sell. I think she got my point, as she mentioned that she does need people to help her sign on new sales people, being she has 2 districts now and the pressure is on. I'll see her today, get my stuff and see what happens. But if I know me, I'll be zinging along in no time. If I want something, I get it. Always. I honestly can't remember a time when I didn't. So this should work out fine. the only thing that is gonna be a bit tough is fitting it in with my already filled work schedual. I'll figure it out as I go, I guess.   It sucks that I have to be at a meeting at 9 AM on my day off. Asshole managers. The good thing is that I can sleep in a bit on Friday morning, because I don't start till 2:30. Thank goodness for that!  After my meeting, I go to meet Diane about the Avon stuff, then I have a 2:00 appointment to get my exhaust pipe welded on my New Yorker. So there goes my day today.  Shot....to....hell. But it's better than any day at work!

      Today was one of those days, when I was wishing it was over, before it even began. I was physically tired, and my brain was like Jello. I drank coffee, and even had one of those "energy drinks" to help boost me along, but I was getting frustrated and tired no matter what I did. I felt like busting Jacob in the mouth when he said' "Look, only 8 more hours to go!" Instead I just muttered "shut the fuck up" under my breath. He didn't quote the time again the rest of the day. I'm home now, and I feel like I got run over by a steamroller...........twice. I need major zzzzzzzz's and I think I'm gonna head in that direction now. Nite.

      Ya know, every year I see it, but I still can't believe it..........Christmas stuff on the shelves in September. Gimme a break! Do people really need 3 &1/2 months to buy decorations for the holiday? Really. In one stop, you can pick up your Fall, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas decorations. I think it's plain stupid, and it takes all the fun and anticipation out of it all.

      I picked up a little treat for myself on the way home tonight. Kit Kat has two special edition bars out, one with white chocolate and one with dark chocolate. I tried both........dark chocolate was a winner with me!     I had a neat idea while I was at work today. I think I'm going to sell Avon again. Just the other day, I was wishing I still had my Avon Rep around, as I used to buy quite a bit from her, and I really like their products. Then it hit me..........I should just sell it, even if just at work and to friends. That way I could get it whenever I need to, and make a bit of change on the side. Even if only enuff to pay for my own stuff. Who knows, maybe I'll even try for manager like I did before I moved up here. We'll see about that, but as for now, I e-mailed the company and said I'd like to be a rep again. Now all I have to do is wait to hear from them.

      Update on Ryan: He finally was able to go home on Thursday, after mucho bullshit. I haven't talked to him, but I'm sure he's very happy to be back home.  Now the legal battle begins, with a hearing and such. I'll give the details as I get them.

      As of tonight, Ry is  still  in the County Jail, and  really scared . Poor guy. He's just a sweet , big hearted country boy from Arkansas, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Could happen to any of us, ya know?  Picture this. He's in a business suit, walking to a sales call, and mother nature calls. So he ducks into an alley, discretely goes behind a dumpster, and takes care of business as  fast  as possible. Well, some woman was walking by, spotted him behind the dumpster, and runs and gets the cops.  Four  squad cars come, and arrest him in the alley, and off he goes to County, where he can't even make a call till he's arraigned. He was arrested at 11am, and it took till midnight for him to get a call out. Today there has been alot more red tape and bullshit. Hopefully he'll be out of there tomorrow.......poor guy. Why couldn't that bitch just mind her own friggin business? And 4 squad cars!!! Please! And aren't there drug dealers and felons out there that they should be paying closer attention to? If he were getting mugged in that alley, would that woman have run and got the police? Would 4 cars have come in seconds? I think not.

      Well, after a long night of no information, we finally got some news this morning. Good news is Ryan is fine, bad news is he's in the County Jail. Yeah, it seems he was arrested for pissing in an alley. Can you believe that shit? Now why he didn't or couldn't call anyone is beyond me. I mean aren't you supposed to get one phone call when your arrested? Naturally we were all thinking the worst last night, and that could have all been avoided if he had just called his wife and told her where he was. At least we wouldn't have spent the night thinking that he might be lying dead somewhere. At least he's okay physically. Now to get him out of the "klink"!

      I'm  really  nervous right now. My sister-in-law Maureen called a bit ago, and she's worried because her hubby Ryan has like, disapeared. He left for work at 7A.M. this morning, didn't call her all day, (which is unusual), isn't home yet, and she gets his voice mail when she calls his cell. I'm really worried, as Ryan is a pretty responsible guy, with two little kids at home and one on the way, and he's not gonna just go out and do stupid shit like not call or come home. She's going to drive to his office, and see if she sees his vehicle there. She said she called the police and hospitals, and they told here that ther have been no accidents in the area. That doesn't mean diddly though, because you can go off the road ond over a hillside and no one would be the wiser. Please be okay Ry. I hope they call and say he's ok. Damn.

      Well I'm pretty pleased. I got Nick an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Spine Center on Monday the 9th! I was really surprised that they were able to see him so soon. Now I just hope that they can help him in a non evasive way, as I feel that surgery should be a final option, and we really haven't persued all the avenues that are out there yet. Well this is a start, and I guess I'll know alot more on Monday night.   I started my work out tonight. Not too much to start with, just some stretching, a few push ups and a few leg and stomach exercises. I need to start out slowly, despite my good intentions, as it's been years since I've worked out, and I don't want to get up tomorrow feeling like I got hit by a semi! It feels good to be getting back in the groove again. I know I can see this through.......yes indeedee!   So far my sales this month are great, and if I can keep it up, September might just be a great month for me. God knows I need it already. Moolah is a bit scarce with itsy bitsy commission checks, and I hate it when the check book is tight. No fun there. I need to get some new work clothes soon! Damn , most of them are so big now that I look totally stupid in them..........like I borrowed someone elses clothes. I'm not complaining, it's just that I have  alot  of clothes that I can't wear now, so it's like I wear the same three outfits to work everyday. Sucks. Good news is........yeah you got it...........shopping trip! See, there's always a rainbow! I better get to bed. I'm starting to sound dorky. Nite! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

      I swear, if smoking doesn't kill me, my job sure as hell will. Today was "balls to the walls" for 7 hours, with only 4 of us sales people on the floor. Damn it was brutal. As I was waiting on one customer, I had at least three more waiting for me to help them.  I am so friggin' tired, that I can't even think straight. Ugh! I think I'm gonna hit the sheets soon here, as I have an 11 hour day ahead tomorrow, but then two wonderful, (and well deserved!), days off!  Can't wait.  On the weight topic.....I'm pretty excited, as I feel I can now begin my "abs training". So far my stomach hasn't been achy for about a week or so, and I figure that means everything is healed up in there. That's a green light for me to start "crunching", and doing various stuff to hopefully trim the "chunky monkey" and the ole hips. The gals at work have been cutting out articles pertaining to ab work-outs for me, which I thought was a sweet thing to do. They're rooting for me big time!  The other day on my dinner break, I found a  great  dress for my nephews wedding in October. It's a sheath dress with a jacket, in black, with a ton of little white dots all over. Sharp. And it's slinky, but not too clingy. I think it's perfect, except for the fact that it's too long and needs hemmed to cocktail length. So I have to call a seamstress and get it done soon. I would also like to get a pair of sexy shoes that I saw at DSW Warehouse, if they still have them. They have a neat ankle strap, and I've always wanted a pair like that, so here's my excuse to get them!  I love shopping  way too much  for my own good!

      Happy Halloween my ass. While we were all at work today, some fuckface(es) broke into our house and ransacked our bedroom. I can't say what was taken and what wasn't, as it's currently under investigation, and the State Troopers advised against mentioning whats missing.  I'm majorly pissed, and creeped out that there was someone in my home that wasn't invited.

      There's one thing that drives me nuts every time we have our first few snowfalls of the season. Drivers adapting to the changing weather. They usually fall into one of two catagories: 1) "The Fearless"  &  2) "The Paranoid"  The "Fearless" drivers feel that they can handle  any  road condition at  any  speed. In fact, the faster the better. Now the "Paranoid" drivers are so freaked out by the snow, that they creep at a snails pace, in fear of losing total control, if God forbid, they went over 15 MPH. Both are a pain in the ass, and both are a hazard on the road. Especially if you end up with a "snail" in front of you, and "The Roadrunner" behind you. As the snow season approaches, I dread the "drivers", not the snow!

      I woke up this morning, with the realization that Nicks birthday is next Tuesday, and I haven't even started getting anything for him. Shit. So on my way home from having rear shocks put on my car, I stopped at Wal Mart, and picked up a few small things. During my dinner hour tomorrow, I'll head out and hopefully find a few more items he would like.    P.S.- There is this new body spray stuff that they have out now for men. Well, I had to test all 5 scents, and after about two minutes or so, as I walked away, there were about a dozen people gagging all over the place, going "what's that *$%@** smell"?  So guys, don't wear all 5 at one time. It didn't go over well at all. *snicker*

      Wow, how our opinions can change over time! I was just watching this piece on VH1 about the band Kiss, who I just  loved  in the 70's. I mean I thought they were the shit back then, and I was totally in love with Paul Stanley. In fact, I even had my picture taken with full Paul stanley make-up on, and I almost looked like his friggin' twin sister or something. (I wish I still had that photo!) Anyway, as I was watching them tell their story, and listening to their music, all I could think to myself was, "Man, they suck".  I don't think there's any other music I listened to then, that I could actually say that about. Oops...................I forgot about Alice Cooper!

This will be her last drive of the season, as I'm putting her away for the winter on Monday. This car is way too much fun. I'll miss driving it.

      Well, it's that time of year again. Put away the Summer garb, and bring out the Winter clothes........and the Halloween decorations. I really don't know how much Halloween stuff I'm gonna put up this year, as I work till 9 on Halloween and I don't know if Jr. will be working late too. See he and I are the ones that dress up and spook the kids on Halloween night. Although who knows, Hubbs might be motivated to put on a mask and scare some Trick or Treaters that night. Trust me, it's a blast! And they really love it too. At least that's what I've been told over the years. I'll miss not being here this year.

      Today was the perfect, lazy Sunday! I slept in a bit, washed up and just lazed around the house with a cup of coffee in hand,' till around noon or so. Then I got my "face on", and went to the store to get a nice roast for dinner. Came back, and put the roast,(and carrots, onions, and mushrooms) in the oven on low. Hubbs got a shower, then we headed to Geneva on the Lake for a nice, relaxing Sunday drive in the Vettester. It was so nice just cruising along looking at all the beautiful leaves, and just talking and laughing at stupid things along the way. Geneva was a really nice place to see, with it's cute cottages and beautiful views of the lake. We decided that next summer, we are going to have to spend some time there.  We came home, and I went back out to get gas and head up to Wal Mart to get a hair bleaching kit for Nick. Well, actually for me, as I bleach his hair for him......lazy ass. By the time I got back, the roast was done, Nick came in from work, and we had a yummy, "just like grandma's" dinner. It was so nice to eat something homemade for a change! Tonight, I bleached Nicks hair, and now I'm relaxing at my 'puter, enjoying what's left of this wonderful Sunday evening.

       Love is a wonderful thing.........but at times, it sucks big time   It's times like these, that I'm glad to be in a long-term relationship, that I believe has weathered the worst of the storms. And hadn't it been for a ton of determination, dedication, love, stubborness, (throw in a touch of good luck), and a willingness to bend a bit, I don't think we'd have made it for 25 years. Being in love is a rough ride, sometimes.  Right now, a couple of young people I care alot about, are going through some rough times, and it's very hard to be on the sidelines, and stay impartial. But I am. And it breaks my heart to see them struggle, although I know that this is a natural process, and it happens to all of us at one time or another. Sometimes, alot. Still it bites. I'm not good at this stuff........seeing people unhappy. I always feel like I can fix things. But in matters of the heart, that are not my own, I can't. And it bites. I see the tears, and I remember well, when they were my tears. I see the anger, and I remember my anger. I see the games. Damn it ,I hate the fuckin' games. I never was a game player, but was always on the receiving end. A strong partnership is built and made stronger by conflicts resolved and learned from. But damn it, don't play friggin' games. They only cause hurt, and don't accomplish  anything  meaningful. And if you think you're a badass cause you play them, well you're not. You're an asshole, plain and simple.   Well, with all that said, all I can do is be here to love and support those two beautiful hearts that are having a rough time right now. (You know who you are) I may not be able to change anything, but maybe I can tell you a few stories that might bring a smile to your face or let you  know that you're not alone in your struggles. And always, a shoulder to cry on and arms to hug you tight. Remember, we've all been there at one time or another. You'll be okay. Promise. *Hugs*

      I've seen this on other sites, and I thought it was kinda neat, so I thought I'd give it a whirl too! The infamous  urlLink "Friday Five"  1.  How many TVs do you have in your home ?   We have 4.  2.  On average, how much TV do you watch in a week ?   Not much actually, maybe 3 hours, tops. 3.  Do you feel that television is bad for young children ?    It depends on what they're watching. When my son was young, he lived on Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers. No violent programs! 4.  What TV shows do you absolutely HAVE to watch, and if you miss them, you're heartbroken ?     None. 5.  If you had the power to create your own television network, what would your line-up look like ?     It would be a cross between MTV and Friends.

      (continued from Monday........) So, after searching around for a place to eat, with no luck, I looked at the window right next to where we were standing, and it was a Howard Johnstons Restaurant. With a few empty tables! In we went, without hesitation. We were seated quickly, and needless to say, we were elated to not only be out of the pouring rain, but on our way to full bellies. Our waiter introduced himself as Raul, but Hubbs kept calling him Ron. Hubbs and I each ordered Reubens and fries, Amanda ordered a chicken sandwhich with fries and Nick had his usual burger and fries. While we waited for our orders to come, some crazy looking characters took seats in the booth next to ours, and I saw this as a photo op, so I got a couple of photos of the locals. (To be continued.....)

      Well, we're back from our wonderful, though hectic as hell, weekend in Jersey & New York. Yeah, I know I didn't post anything about the trip coming up, but last week I was lucky I had time to breathe, let alone post.  Anyway, despite feeling exhausted, I had a  wonderful  time! The drive wasn't too bad, considering I'm not one to really love traveling (driving) all that much. The scenery was spectacular, with the mountains covered in multi-colored foilage, although on our trip there, it was a dreary day with fog and drizzle. The ride home today was sunny and clear, so we were able to see more than we did going.   We arrived on Saturday around 3ish, checked into our rooms, and just hung out for a bit.  After we unpacked and relaxed, we headed out to find Times Square. With map in hand, Hubbs manuvered us along the highways, through the tunnel and into New York City without a hitch! We parked, and before you knew it, we were looking at Times Square right in front of us! Woo hoo, it's one crazy friggin' place I'll tell ya! Throw in alot of rain, a zillion people rushing in every direction, most with umbrellas over their heads, and you get the picture. We just jumped in, and went with the flow, darting across streets, trying not to get run over by any cabs or buses. We really had no clue where we were going, but we managed to find a few things we wanted to see, like MTV, The Hard Rock Cafe, ESPN, you get the picture. The funny part of it was, that Hubbs was carrying my umbrella, a white one with pink and green tulips on it, and man he really stood out in the huge crowd! One guy on the street even made a comment about it! We were starved at this point, and without knowing where anything really was, we kinda were on the lookout for a place to eat. Problem was that every place was either filled, or had an hour or more wait, and we didn't have that kind of time to spare.  (to be continued................)

      I feel like I got hit by a friggin' truck today. In fact, I was so tired when I left work, I could barely drive home. This is ridiculous. I went to bed at 10:15, but I got up a bit ago, as I was craving an english muffin. I just finished the muffin, so I think I better head back to the sheets so I don't feel like "shit on a stick" again tomorrow. I love my folks to bits, but damn those people wear me out!!!

      Damn, today flew by too fast. I took Mom and Dad out shopping after lunch today, and we hit a few more stores than originally planned. We started at Gabes, but not much was happening there, so we went in to my store for awhile, and I introduced them to a few of the "crew" there. They really enjoyed meeting them, even though my Mom bolted out the door, as she felt she wasn't dressed nice enuff to meet anyone. Don't ask. From there we went to TJ Maxx and browsed around a bit........not much interestiong there either, except they had some awesome coats there that I would love to have. Only problem is, they weren't very practical, but hey, I can't help it that I lean towards the funky sometimes! We left there and headed to Staples to see Nick, and let my Mom look for some organizer hickey that she wants. We saw Nick, but my Mom didn't find what she wanted so off we went to Target...............same scenario, but we left with a "gourmet" pretzel and an icee. Yum, they were good! We headed for home, voting to order pizza for dinner, instead of making something ourselves.  Mom and I made a nice salad, and before you knew it, the pizza was at the door. Eat, throw the plates in the dishwasher, and we're done. Love it! Well, back to the day flying by so fast..........I can't believe I go back to work on Wednesday. Damn. This week is gonna be a bit hectic, (in a good way), getting ready for our trip to New Jersey. I'm really excited, as we haven't been on a real trip for years, so this is going to be a good time. I can just feel it!

      I've been doing a bit of "Blog-surfing" lately, and I thought it was kinda neat when I discovered some blogs had this option where you could choose another skin (usually from a group of 4 or 5 choices) for their Blog. I was like, "How friggin' cool is this?" So being the middle-aged  kid that I am, I didn't read the Blog, I played with the skins! Entertaining to say the least. (Of course, everyone else out there probably knew about this stuff already) I'm a late bloomer when it comes to alot of these things!

      My Dad and Mom arrived safely around 4:30ish, and we sat around and chatted, catching up on my Dads trip down West Vrginia, and all kinds of stuff. I made a spaghetti dinner, which was so filling, I felt like I weighed a ton afterwards. I love pasta, but I hate how bloated it makes me feel afterwards. Anyway, after dinner, Jr. had to go to North East to pick up a part for his car, and he asked "Pap" to go along for the ride. Of course he said yes. Well, I was also in the mood to take "Baby" out for a little spin, so I grabbed my Mom, and off we went too. Just for a buzz around town though, but it was nice all the same. We just hung around the house watching T.V. the rest of the night, which was fine with me, as I was starting to get a bit sleepy. Right now, Hubbs is in bed and my Mom hit the sheets a few minutes ago too. Dad's watching T.V. and I guess it's obvious what I'm doing.  Anyway, I'm gonna hit the sheets soon myself. My peepers are tired. Shit, I'm tired all over........all the cleaning around here has just worn me out. NIck and Amanda went to Daves for one of his parties tonight. I hope they're having a nice time. Nite! Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.

      My Mom called yesterday morning, (waking me up I might add), and asked me if I still wanted her and Dad to come up for a visit. I told her "of course", then went back to bed. Shit, I hope that's all I said..........afterall, I was half asleep. Uh oh. I hope I wasn't a smartass.

      I never thougt I'd hear myself say this, but I was kinda glad to go back to work today. No, I'm not losing my mind, but it was a nice break from cleaning the house, I must admit. I was beginning to get a bit edgy about me being the sole cleaning person around this place, and the more I cleaned, the more pissed off I was getting. So going back for awhile today, and gabbing with the "crew" was a good diversion. Kept me from kicking some asses around here!

      I laid down for a nap around 2:30 yesterday afternoon, and I had one of those weird, vivd dreams that usually only happen to me if I sleep during the daytime. I was in this awesome house, my house, a house I've seen in my dreams before. The sucker is huge, with all kinds of whacky shit like a revolving living room, secret buttons everywhere that turn stereos and tv's on and off, just off the wall stuff everywhere. And the place is so huge, that you never seem to see the same rooms twice. Everything is crystal, velvet, silver.....just plain over the top. Well, after just getting into enjoying my new " dream address", I awake to find myself back in my little corner of the "non-spinning livingroom"  world, and I'm a bit pissed. Damn, I was enjoying that place.

      Well, as of right now, at least two rooms in the house are less cluttered, and a bit more inhabitable. I also got the bed linens washed and put on, and next it's on to the dishes and folding clothes. My reward? A nice long hot shower before relaxing a bit, then bed. I'm pleased with my progress.

      I thought I'd get a small post in here before I start my day. Yupper, I'm off today, and I'm enjoying it already, even though I've only been awake for a bit. There's a gazillion things I can get into around here, and where I will start is a mystery right now, but I need to get some major cleaning done  soon . I also need to get my Vettster ready to be put away for winter, *sigh*, and the New Yorker up to speed for Winter. There sure as hell is alot to do when you have two cars. No, I'm not complaining, I just never realized how many details need to be taken care of with this "seasonal car" stuff!  No problem though, I'm figuring it all out as I go, with  alot  of help from Hubbs. (And numerous paychecks!)   I think one of my missions is gonna be to throw out alot of stuff I have clutterung up my computer area, and put my Avon things here. This house is so small, that I don't have many options for an "office area" for my work. I think this area will will work well for that application. It has to......it's my only option!  Speaking of Avon, my order arrives tomorrow! Yeah! I always love order day because       it's such a blast to look through all the goodies that come! It's like Christmas. I know, I'm strange. But isn't that what ya love about me? Lol!

      I-Moods should have "holidayish" as one of their moods, because that's how I'm feeling. Holidayish. I bought two new Christmas music tapes today to add to my collection, and I can't wait to pop them in the stereo, and start Fa La La-ing right along with the music. We're kind of in a Thanksgiving limbo right now, as I don't know if we're going down to the 'Burgh, or if we're staying home. The weather forecast will determine where we eat the turkey! No matter what, a turkey will be enjoyed, wether here, in Pittsburgh or at Amandas house. Thanks for the invitation sweetie. That was so nice of you! :O)  I can't wait to get our tree and decorations up next week, and get started on our holiday shopping. I just love this time of year!

       Things I just wanna say...to no one in particular, and everyone in general  1) You make your own happiness........no one can make you happy if you can't. 2) Love yourself. Self-confidence is  very  attractive! 3) Learn to like being alone with yourself.........you are your own best-friend. 4) Don't settle for bullshit........either make it better, or find better. Be it a job, a love, whatever. It's out there. It just takes time. 5) Happily ever-after does not mean being happy  every  fuckin' day. That's fantasy. Reality has happy times as well as rough times. 6) Getting through the rough times makes you stronger. It really does. 7) If the rough times  never  seem to  end,  you've got a major problem. Love finds solutions, and is willing to bend in order to mend. 8) Yes, you can have "forever" with someone. I do. 9) Life is a journey of growth and learning. If you're not learning and/or growing, you need to find out what's stopping you. 10) Most growth, be it  mental, spiritual, or in love, generally follows great struggle. 11) Life is a wonderful, mysterious, sometimes scary journey. Enjoy the trip and love every minute of being your wonderful self!

      The snowfall we had yesterday really put me into the holiday spirit. I feel the need to pull out all my Christmas cd's and tapes, and listen to them in my car on the way to and from work. (Helps curb holiday "road rage" too. It's hard to be pissed at a slow driver if you're listening to Frosty the Snowman!!) I think I'm gonna pull out the decorations the week after Thanksgiving, when I'll be off for three days and I can take my time. Sounds like a plan to me!   Work today was the usual drag, but I made it through, as usual. I had a nice surprise when I got home though. Hubbs and Nick went to Sears and bought us a new fridge! Awsome! Our old one was 21 years old......yikes! As long as we've been married. This one is pretty big compared to our old one, and I keep running into it, as I'm not used to it sticking out so far. Hopefully I'll get the hang of it before I'm covered in bruises! It even has an ice machine.........woohoo! Hey, it doesn't take much for me to get excited. Thanks guys for all you did to get this new one in and the old one out! Great job!!

      Nick is home and asleep after getting his injection. Everything went fine, even though he was a bit anxious before and during the procedure. I was glad that they asked me to go in with him during the injection. I think it made both of us feel better.  He is schedueled for another one on December 16th, and I think for that one, I'm gonna give him a bit more sedative before hand, as the dose he took today didn't seem to calm him as much as he would have liked. Hopefully the shots will relieve his pain for him.....poor guy has suffered enuff already.

      Ahhh, alas the stormy seas of love seem a bit more tranqil today. And the sailors are smiling once again.......a welcome sight indeed. The journey of love is never-ending, and at times we all hit rough waters, sometimes falling over-board and nearly drowning in our tears. But if you hold on to tight to your heart-strings, dear Tenderhearts, your love for eachother will, more times than not, pull you through the storm.

      Get this: our ladies room toilet clogged up yesterday, so today the boss gets Roto Rooter to come in and un-clog the sucker. After all is said and done, he walks over to us gals and states that a paper towel was the culprit of the clog, and it cost him $100.00 to fix it. Of course there's a big sign in the ladies room about this now. Furthermore, if this happens again, he's gonna have to shut down our bathroom. WTF. (Next thing you know, he's gonna lock the sucker up, and put the key on a big hunk of wood, like at a gas station, and make us as ask for permission to use it like a school kid.) This is beyond ludicrious. Then to top it all off, the woman who is our store decorator, and cleaning woman, starts bitching about how much toilet paper  we go thru in a week. Another WTF! I guess we'll have to start rationing paper next. We laughed so hard about this today, I thought I was gonna split my gut! This is just insane. These people  really  need to get a life. Hell, you can't even take a piss anymore without getting some kind of complex!

      Today started out the usual way, with me thinking my "this job sucks ass" thoughts.Then all hell broke loose, and we were bombarded with frenzied customers for about 5 hours straight. No shit. We couldn't even go take a piss without someone tracking us down for help. Now don't get me wrong, this is a welcome change. But damn, it was a bit much. Luckily I had a few great sales that will hopefully bring me up to speed for the month. Even so, I'm having a martini tonight, partially in celebration for a great day of sales, and partially because my job still sucks ass. See, one great day does not a wonderful job make. It sure as hell feels great, but does not make up for the hundreds of f*cked up days. I need a career change. I have some options in mind. It won't be quick in coming, but everyday I need to keep my goals in sight, and I'll get there. I always do. I need more olives.

       Shaken, stirred, I don't care! Just hurry up! I had an "I hate my job" day today. I have these alot, but today was bad. I mean I  really  zombied out on this shit today. I hated being in the building, hated my customers, hated my bosses, hated that we  still  have no heat, hated that I work on commission, hated that sales are down, and especially hated that there are others that seem so lucky, and I'm on the bottom of the sales "shit list" for more than a month now. These are the reasons that I'm drinking a double martini right now. It's either have a stiff drink, or burn down the building. I chose the drink, as I would not do well in prison. The outfits suck, and I never have been, nor will I ever be, somebodys bitch. Nuff said 'bout that. So here I sit, hating my job with a passion, but I do have some alternate plans in the works. Problem is, they're not a quick fix, (like I really would love), but some things to work towards, in order to get my frustrated ass outta the "hell hole" of retail sales. 'Till then, I guess I need to stock up on lots of 'tini fixins, as I think It's gonna be a bumpy ride kids. Have a nice evening!

Now all I need to do tomorrow, is get all this crap out of my diningroom, and I'll be a happy gal indeed. Clean one room, trash three in the process........it never fails.

Hubbs and I are taking him out to dinner, then home for cake and ice cream. It will just be a simple evening, with us , Amanda, and maybe a couple of his friends coming over too.

But most memorable, will always be the teenage years. Indeed.

      I just got in from driving Amanda home, and I'll tell ya, I saw more deer tonight than I've seen in two Winters combined. Scary part is, two of them passed about 4 feet in front of my bumper. Luckily I was driving slowly, anticipating that I might come across them. To tell you the truth, I'm not afraid of hitting a deer, but I  am  afraid of the friggin' air bag going off in my face if I do. Hitting the deer would probably just crunch my front end. The air bag would probably rip my head off. I fear the air bag.

      Besides all the other crazy bullshit that went on around here last night, a friend of my son's was killed in a car accident. His name was Shawn. Now I didn't know this young man, but just hearing the news hit me in the pit of my stomach, and in my heart. It took me bact to two years ago this January, when my son Nick was in a horrendous car accident, that he survived only by a seatbelt and the Grace of God. I remember the call from my husband, and the tone of his voice. I remember when he told me that NIck was in an accident and it was bad, and mumbling the words "is he alive?" and praying the answer was yes. The answer was "yes". I knew I could handle  anything , as long as the answer was "yes". My heart aches tonight for a mother, father, siblings perhaps, and friends who didn't hear the answer "yes" when they asked the same question yesterday. I can't even imagine their pain. My thoughts and prayers go out to Shawns family and friends tonight, to give them strength through this time of loss and pain. My prayers go to Shawn, that he is in peace. Hug the ones you love a little tighter tonight. Say "I love you", just one more time. Smile, laugh, be silly, overlook the stupid things, embrace the "now", count your blessings,  live  everyday............because you never know. You just never know.

      This Enetation commenting system is starting to piss me off majorly. They're constantly off-line or doing some kind of upgrade crap, but the Pro version is never affected. Isn't that odd? Basically it's the old, give us some cashola and we won't mess with your shit. Well, just use the Tag Board for comments in the meantime, okay?

      Well, I finally got this new skin up, but I still have a few kinks to work out. I also fixed the comments problem, although for the life of me, I don't know what happened there. Oh well, who gives a shit anyway. I sure as hell don't, so I most certainly don't expect you to.   Today was an uneventful day, just like I hoped it would be. I love the days following the holidays, when you can just unwind and put all the hustle and bustle (and stress!) behind, and just look at all the great gifts you got, and enjoy it all. Personally, I'm enjoying all the edible goodies around here at the moment, because starting January 1st, it's back to watching the snacking and junk food again. I lost a few pounds before I had my surgery, and it felt  so  good. But after the surgery, I was able to eat normally again, and I put a couple back on, so I want to get back on track before it all creeps up on me again. And it happens fast if you're not careful. So, beginning the new year, I'm watching what and when I eat, and hitting the floor on my new exercise mat, ( thanks again Amanda!), to work those neglected abs. Neglected for like, um let me see...........   20 freakin' years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Can you tell I don't quite enjoy ab work-outs? Well, I promised myself a belly piercing if I can get my tummy to the point where I can flash it a tad bit. Now not like Britney or anything. Just a glimmer, a little bit.....a sneak peek. I'd be happy with that. Indeed! Wish me luck.

      Merry, Merry Christmas to one and all! Man am I happy to be home. We had a crazy day of visiting, but enjoyed each stop to the fullest! It really was fun, even though we we're growing pretty weary by evening. The ride home was very long, slow, and nerve wracking, as we drove through an ice storm, then snow. It seemed like we would never get here. Sheesh! We saw cars flipped over, and some that had just slid off the road. I'm  really  glad to be home safe and sound. Thank goodness Hubbs is such a wonderful driver! Well, another year that we wished eachother "Merry Christmas" while on the good old interstate! Santa comes soon, so I gotta head to bed.

      Well folks, it's here. Christmas Eve Day. I hope you have all your gifts bought and wrapped, and all the little (and big) details finalized, cause guess what.......you're runnin' out of time if you haven't! I ran around all day and finally got everything under control.....or at least make it appear to be. Lol. We're off to visit family today, in an all day holiday "blitz", (we'll miss you Amamda!), then back home late tonight, so we can be home in the morning and enjoy a lazy Christmas Day. Sounds great to me after all the hustle and bustle that's been going on the past few weeks. I'm making a turkey tomorrow, but nothing elaborate. Like I said, the emphasis is on lazy! Hmmm, I wonder what Santa is gonna bring me this year? My list was rather sparse, so this should be interesting. If I get what I asked for, I'll get a Colgate Spinbrush Pro, a sideview mirror for the "Vette and a turntable for the microwave. I hope I get the mirror! Well, I better fly off to dreamland, as It's going to be a busy day tomorrow and we are getting up pretty early. Oh, and Amanda. Hurry back. I miss you! Night all.....sweet dreams. You know....sugarplums and such! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

      Today was a productive day, to say the least. I got my guest-room cleaned out, and all the christmas boxes into the shed, washed my bed linens, did other laundry too, mopped the kitchen floor, shampooed the living room carpet, cleaned the clutter off the kitchen counter, finished decorating the house, made some calls, wrote out a few more Christmas cards, and did some last minute online shopping! Whew! Oh yeah.......I did my nails too! Did I ever tell you how much I  love  online shopping? I don't do it  all  that much, but I'll tell ya, at holiday time, it sure is a time saver and sometimes a life saver if you're short on time but need that gift quick! It's saving my ass big time this year. I just don't have the time to drive around from store to store and hope they have what I need. I don't think anyone does anymore, quite frankly. Well, I'm beat after my long day, and I have an even longer day at "the Grind" tomorrow, so for now....... night, night! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

      I haven't been bloggong in awhile, as I've either been working, or frantically trying to get ready for Christmas. I shopped at Wal Mart for about 4 hours on Sunday night, and got all but a few gifts. This made me feel alot better, as before my shopping trip, I had no gifts purchased. None. Nada. I was freakin' out about it. Bad. Now we only have to figure out what we're getting my parents, and Hubbys mom. It's a bitch, because they have so much stuff already. I dunno what we'll come up with, but damn it, we have a fast approaching deadline here. Think, think, think. Nuthin'. Shit. Other than that, things are rolling right along. I got a few more decorations up today, and the way I figure it, if it doesn'tn get put out......oh well. No one will notice but me anyway. Trust me. Well, i'm gonna hit the sack soon, one more day off and I have alot to get done tomorrow. Nitey night!

      Well, yesterday I had my annual "holiday meltdown". It's like all the details of what I need to get done in the next couple of weeks, like shop, wrap, finish decorating, laundry, bills, not enuff time...... start swirling around in my head, like one of those spin pictures you make at the fair, till I feel like I'm having a friggin' anxiety attack. I think I do actually have an anxiety attack. Sleep is my only savior. So I crashed out early, and the good news is, today was a much better day. I was focused, and not anxious at all. I got the tree decorated, made plans with hubby to go shopping on Sunday, and had a good day in general. I know that when I finally but some gifts, I'll feel alot better, but the fear of not finding the gifts I want makes me nuts. Another problem is,  I don't know  exactly what I want to get. Great, another crisis looms. Just kidding. Sometimes I get so caught up in the holiday hustle, that I forget what's most important. Enjoying it. I'll have to keep reminding myself of that on a regular basis. Nite!

      I really should be in bed by now, but I feel like I'm still unwinding from the horrid day I had today. Nothing particular happened to make it terrible, it just sucked in general. My attitude toward my job has been spiraling downward faster and faster as time goes by. It used to be weeks between my frustrating times........now it's days between. Sometimes one day. Today I felt so stressed, I just wanted to run out the door. This shit sucks big time. I really need to find a job that I feel fulfilled doing, not this shit where I count the hours 'till quitting time, leave stressed and dread going in the next day. There has to be more to a job than this. This is friggin' torture. Goodnight.

      I had a fabulously wonderful day today............doing something I wanted to do, instead of doing things I should do. Like boring hosehold stuff. Sometimes the practical Capricorn side of me keeps me from having fun. Today I wasn't about to let that happen, and I'm so glad didn't! Amanda and I went out gown shopping together, for a wedding she's in this coming January. I had a  great  time, and I believe she did too. And the best thing was that she found a gorgeous gown, that she just loves and looks adorable in, in no time at all!! Wow! Actually it was the first one she tried on, and that was that. It looked perfect, except for possibly needing hemmed and the straps altered a bit. That's it! Amazing. We headed to the mall, and she found cute shoes in Penneys. All she needs is to figure out the jewelry and a bag. I can't wait to see how she looks on the day of the wedding. I think she'll look like a Winter Princess. *smiles*    Well, as much as I hate to, I must head off to bed now, as it's back to the "grind" tomorrow, and I don't want to be draggin' my ass all day. Ugh, going back is always  rough after 3 days of being at home. But at least I return knowing that I got a few things on my "to do" list taken care of. I got the Christmas decorations started, the hamster cages cleaned, and my Avon books delivered. In the next couple weeks, I need to decorate the tree, write and send out the Christmas cards, go shopping, and figure out what the hell I want for Christmas besides a Colgate Spinbrush Pro. Honestly, that's all I can think that I want. *shrugs shoulders* Nitey night snow babies.

      Well, I was in the mood to change the look of my page a bit, but I really like the lay-out. So I decided to just change the color combinations from time to time. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.........just jazz it up a bit!  Works for me.

      I really like the Swappingtons way of doing things. You swap your stuff for someone elses stuff. Pretty cool idea. Only problem I may have, is that I don't want to get rid of any of my stuff. I want new stuff, yesindeedee, but I can't seem to give up any old stuff to get it. I think I'm in a Swappingtons limbo here. Go figure.

      I slept until 11:30 today, and I have to say it felt wonderful. No guilt.......I deserved it. I busted ass all day today, and got everything accomplished that I set out to do. Yes, the Christmas stuff is down, and neatly tucked away in boxes that are patiently waiting to be transported to the shed tomorrow. Amen. I couldn't bear to look at it one more day.     The hassles at work are still the same. The meeting with the District Manager went well, but I don't know if any real concrete results will ensue from it. I guess only time will tell. Meantime, I'm still sucking ass in sales this month, and only a true miracle from God can save me at this point. But I decided not to stress about it, just get through the days, and let the chips fall where they may. If I get canned, I'll find something else, after collecting unemployment all Summer. No biggie. It just pisses me off though, because I'm not making any money right now. Well, I better hit the sheets. Long day tomorrow, and it's only longer if I'm draggin' my ass all day! goodnight.

      Has it been almost a week since I last graced my Blog pages with useless, rambling bullshit? Sheesh, I guess so! How time flys when your tired as a dead dog and gagging on gross cough meds, just so you can try to eek out perhaps a couple hours of sleep at night. Get the picture? I been feelin' like shit lately, and just haven't been up to sharing my precious thoughts. Well, here I am, feeling better, but not quite full throttle just yet. I think tonight is "clean house night" for my hamsters. I have become a slum-lord, and they're starting to give me dirty little hamster looks. That, or I've just taken too damn cold meds over the past two weeks. Nah, they're lookin' at me funny. So I better get my ass in gear and spruce up the little critters abodes.........pronto.

      After choking back my morning dose of cough syrup, the thought occurred to me. Why can't anyone make a decent tasting cough medicine for adults? I mean, they make all kind of flavored stuff for kids, don't they? Maybe I should try a bottle of their cough meds, although I'd probably have to down half a bottle to get the same effect.  I guess I'm stuck with the nasty tasting shit I have. This stuff could gag a maggot. Ugh.

      The meeting with the District Jackass, oops, I mean Manager was cancelled due to snow. Not that I want to drive to a meeting when we got about a foot of snow today, but it figures that just when we get the chance to voice our opinions, a friggin' snowstorm blows in and we get put on hold. Figures.

      It was pure suckage at work today. And yesterday too......yeah I might as well throw that in since we're on the subject. We're all trying to keep eachother up-beat and motivated, but it's so hard when business is slower than it's ever been, and our jobs are threatened if we don't meet the quotas. I'm not gonna lie. We're frustrated, scared, and pissed off. Mostly pissed off. And each day just seems to get worse. Thursday morning, we are meeting with one of the corporate guys, our  elusive  District Manager, to discuss our grievences. This outta be good. The district Managers are the assholes who thought up all this quota bullshit. Hell, he isn't going to back down. His job is secure, no matter how many of us sales people go down the tubes. The only positive thing is, that at least we're going to have a chance to have our say, even if it doesn't get us anywhere. I guess I'll know more after Thursday. On a brighter note, I'm off for two days! Tomorrow is R&R day. I think I'll try to get the Christmas stuff put away on Thursday. Sounds like a plan to me!

      I haven't felt like posting lately, as,  just as I was bragging to Hubbs that I haven't been sick in 2 years,  wham , I get hit with a nasty cold. And the couple of days I had off, I've spent visiting with my parents, who are staying with us for a few days. Nothing new anyway. Same old shit. I have to get a good nights sleep tonight, as all the running around and staying up late are catching up to me today. Hopefully, I'll be feeling good as new in a day or two, and I can get back to my usual smart-ass ways. Nite!

      Sometimes I wonder, why so many people spend so much time thinking about life, instead of living it. I dunno. It baffles me. As they sit pondering their direction in this life; it's meaning and purpose; why life is as it is; where they should be; where they want to be; where they could be; where they've been; why they've been there; who they've been with and why; who they should be with and why; why they're wonderful; why they're not and so forth and so on. Hell, I have a friggin' migrane just reading this stuff. No wonder they're stressed..............they think too goddamn much! Meanwhile, life is passing them by, while they think about it................instead of just enjoying the ride and living it! I mean, it's a good thing to think about your future, and learn from past mistakes. But hell, don't spend every waking moment trying to understand the mysteries of life. If we were able to figure them out, they wouldn't be mysteries now would they? Go out, have a great time, take the good with the bad, and spread around as much love and compassion as you can, every day. Everything else will fall into place, wether you think about it or not. Don't think about life. Live it and love it!

      As planned, I did take the day off, and so far it's been going well in the cleaning department. I always dread making "the call", but after I do, all is well! It's snowing lightly, so Nick is anticipating a good day of snowboarding at the Peek. He'll be leaving shortly, so that leaves me alone to conquer the dust in the castle. I really hope he has a good time today, as the last few times he's gone, the conditions were shitty. Well, I'm off to continue my work. Have a wonderful day snowbabies!

      I had a  wonderful  birthday today, (even though my best-friend forgot about it), just spending the day at home with my honey. I slept in, and he brought me coffee to start my day, along with  lots  of "Happy Birthday" wishes. Then we watched the game together, which was a real "nail biter" to say the least! As I stated in my last post, the Steelers did win in a  tense  final 5 minutes of the game. All I can say is that praying does work, as I did alot of that during those final minutes!  Then Hubbs grilled me (us) a wonderful steak dinner, which was yummy. After dinner, he brought in a beautiful birthday cake, ablaze with candles, singing Happy Birthday to me, as he carried the cake. It was very pretty with chocolate icing and red roses (for love). He brought me gifts, one at a time.............a new wash mit for the 'Vette.........a CD tower for my PC...........an optical mouse.........a new mouse pad............and a CD changer for the 'Vette........and last but not least, a really awesome card! I loved every bit of my day, spent the way I wanted, with my family. My brother Mike called and so did my parents, also adding to my days joy. Now the only thing is, do I call in sick tomorrow? See, my folks are due to come up on Tuesday afternoon and I work thru Tuesday night. This scenerio leaves me only tomorrow night after 9:30 PM to clean up around here. Hmmmm. It would be much less stressful if I cleaned tomorrow, and worked Tuesday, then Wednesday and Thursday off, to visit with my folks............rested and relaxed. I'm convinced. I'm blowing off tomorrow, for my sanitys sake.

      Today was another stressful day at work. And for  good  reason this time. Shit hit the fan at our Friday sales meeting, as we found out that the corporation has  again  raised our sales expectations.  Bad enough in and of itself, made even worse by low sales the past few months. A couple of the guys were trying to figure out how long it will be untill all of us are gone. June? Maybe July? I came home frazzled to the core. I realize I have to come up with a plan "B" should I get the "boot". Good news is, if I do get fired over quotas, I can at least collect unemployment for awhile. Bad news is...........no benefits. I need to line up my ducks in a hurry. Man this sucks. Sometimes I honestly believe that good guys finish last.

      I am tired. Not just regular tired, but super- duper, supersized tired. It was a long day at work today, 9 to 9, and one of my co-workers bitched and moaned about everything under the sun, all friggin' day. This made a long day seem twice as long. If he does it again tomorrow, I'm taking him out into the parking lot, and slapping the shit out of him. Really. In my last post I mentioned being more compassionate this year. Well, I tried that with this fella most of the day today, but compassion wore thin around 6 P.M. Sorry, that's the reality of it. Anyway, give me a break.......it's only January the 2nd. You honestly can't expect me to be a pro at it already, can ya? Plus, I didn't think I'd be tested so soon. Gotta hit the sheets now......................I'm fading fast! Nitey night sweet dreamers.

      I was sitting here trying to figure out what my one New Years resolution was going to be this year. I used to make a whole shitlist of resolutions, but found it hard to keep,  hell even remember , any of them. So I decided to pick one thing each year that I could  really  concentrate on changing. Improving. I think this year it's gonna be in the compassion department. I feel I need a bit of work in being more compassionate towards others. Now, I don't feel that I totally suck in this area, but I do feel like I could hone it a bit, and get a bit deeper. Yeah that's it! This year I'm going to work on being a more loving and compassionate person. ( No, I didn't forget about the abs either!)

      Well, another New Years Eve has come and gone, and as usual, I bought too much cheese. Other than that, it was a nice, cozy evening at home , watching movies, (Triple X and Barbershop), with Hubbs, Nick and Amanda. Hubbs dozed off around 11, as usual, but awoke in time for our New Years toast. I'm headed to dreamland any second here, as I work tomorrow morning and dragging my ass all day isn't the way I want to start 2003. Night all, and I hope this year holds only the best for you!

      My last post is directed to those of you that experience winter every year. And by that I mean, temperatures near 0, blowing and drifting snow, snowpiles up over your head, ice storms, dodging assholes that drive too fast for conditions, etc. Not just where the temps. fall 20 degrees or so, and it's a bit "chilly" outside. That aint fuckin' winter, see? So if you're one of those people that have a "chilly" winter, and you're asking yourself, "What's so bad about February"?.......... bite me . And have a nice day.

      When it comes to reading web logs, there's nothing that bugs me more than people that just can't friggin' spell, or don't bother to check their spelling. I hope it's just that they're lazy and don't check the spelling, because if that's not the case, we have alot of people out there in "higher education" that couldn't spell a word properly to save their fuckin' life.

I hope I can fight this one off better than I did the last one. I know that I need to get a good nights sleep tonight, as I have a really long day ahead tomorrow. *dread* Good news is, I have a 4 day week at work, so I'm very happy about that! Then a wonderful 3 day weekend to top it off! Woo hoo! I'll have to keep that in mind, as I trudge throught the day tomorrow. Night all, I'm off to sleepy land. Zzzzzzzzz.

My eyes are blurry, my neck is stiff and I haven't been sleeping well lately. Maybe a hot shower will set me right. I don't know. Right now I just feel like  dog shit .  But, tomorrow's a new day, and after work tomorrow....oh yeah.....two  delicious  days off! I'm so ready for those days off. G'night!

      The thought of all those young people lost in that tragic club fire in Rhode Island just has me so upset and sad. Especially when it didn't have to happen. That band shouldn't have had pyro shit in a small club like that, with flammable materials all around them. And it's not as if they were a new band or something, with no experience. They've been around for a long time, with lots of venues in the past. Where were they're heads? Too late now. Lots of empty beds tonight, where feisty young people should be sleeping, dreaming about what a wonderful time they had last night. But they're not there tonight. I can't even imagine the pain of the families and friends.. I think I'm gonna go give my son an extra big hug tonight. And be very happy to see him lounging on his bed.

      There is power in prayer, this I know. Another thing I know involving prayer, is that it doesn't work in regards to things like Ebay. Ebay is  "prayer-proof".  I can't seem to stay away from the shopping nirvana I've discovered right here in the comfort of my own home. See, I'm a confessed shopahoilc, and bringing my passion to my fingertips, any time night or day, well....................it's a big friggin' problem, and I feel I need some kind of divine intervention here. Or some Ebay Kriptonite. Whatever. I know....... I need Bush to nuke Ebay..... that's it! Problem solved. And this would be as nice diversion for him. Now I just gotta find that White House link, so I can drop him a line about my proposal. Later!

      Today's prayer: "Dear Lord, since I have discovered Ebay, my life has gone to auction hell. I can't stop looking for auctions, placing bids, and hitting the PayPal button at break neck speeds. I need help here.....fast! Is there any chance that Ebay could go offline for like, a month or so while I get myself into a 12 step recovery program? Any help would be appreciated. While I wait for your reply, I'll be browsing around in Auto Parts and Accessories". Amen

      I didn't smack Joy upside her head yesterday, but I did tell her that if she ever does that shit again, I'm gonna haul her outside and give her a good ass whippin'. I think she got my drift.

      Work was less than great today. I only had one sale today, and that was nothing to write home about. Then at the very end of the day, Joy jumps my up, and gets a nice sale out of it. Meanwhile, she already has over $4000.00 in sales for the day.  When I approached her about it, she just giggled and played stupid about the whole issue. So I told her that if I ever do the same thing to her, I don't want to hear a god damn thing about it. God, I just wanted to smack her a good one, right upside her head.  I still might .

What a romantic he is, and how fortunate I am to have him to love me. And here I am armed only with chocolate strawberries and whipped cream..........hmmmm. I love Valentines Day!

      Well, I offically started my Tae Bo workouts today, and I guess it's obvious it didn't kill me (yet). I didn't make it through the whole tape, and I only did half of the sets they did, but I broke a pretty good sweat, and called it quits when I knew I had enough. Not too bad  for one who hasn't worked out in about 20 years or so. I did enjoy the workout, and I feel it will keep my interest for a long time. I plan to do basic mat exercises along with the Tae Bo as a change of pace. Phew............gotta hit the shower.

      I really got alot done today, which was a nice surprise, considering that I had originally planned on sitting on my ass all day, and doing nuthin'! I went to Wal Mart and had my oil changed in the New Yorker, and did a bit of cosmetic shopping. Yeah, even though I sell Avon, and I primarily buy their stuff, I like to try new stuff by other brands too. I left there, and went to Hallmark to pick up a couple of birthday cards and a few Valentines. From there, I delivered a couple of orders, then headed home to make chili for dinner, and do laundry, clean up the kitchen, write out bills...................and now that all that's done, I'm relaxing! I joined Ebay the other day, and I currently have a bid in for a chrome air cleaner lid for the Vette. I think it will look sharp, adding a bit of chrome under the hood, and the price was right, so it's an inexpensive addition to boot. I gotta think thrifty, as I want to have plenty of cash for the necessities............like gas. And at the rate the prices are going, it's gonna cost a friggin' fortune  to cruise this summer. Hopefully prices will drop drastically by then. *crosses fingers*    I also checked out the beginners Tae Bo tape today, and all I have to say is that it's either gonna whip my ass into fantastic shape, or...........kill me. There's no grey area here. I mean, Billy Blanks is sweating like a pig, and he's in fantastic shape. I really hope I don't die. If I do croak, please lay me out in a crop top to show off the great abs I (hopefully) have. I mean, that's what this was all about, and I don't want to go to the grave without anyone seeing them. Thanks in advance.

      I'm really excited about starting Tae bo workouts. I believe this will be one exercise plan that will not only work, but will keep me interested and motivated. I loved it when Hubbs and I took martial arts classes together in our twenties, and being that this is very similar, I think I'll like it alot. Once I get past the initial aches and pains of beginning a new workout, I'll be fine.

      Well, I haven't posted in awhile, because I've been pretty busy working, and really haven't had much to say. Work has been going great this week. In fact everything has been great lately. I'm almost afraid if I talk about how wonderful things are, I'll jinx myself. Nah......I really don't believe in that shit. Lately I've been feeling on top of the world........at work, at home, in my head, body and spirit. It's like everything is working perfectly and at peak performance. I love this shit! It feel so wonderful to be in charge of things for a change, like finally alot of things are going my way. I have three glorious days off ahead, and I plan to enjoy them to the fullest!

      Hubbs arrived home safely tonight around 8ish. This was a surprise to me, as they weren't supposed to get in till tomorrow night. Oh well, it's nice to have him home again, and I did get the house all spiffed up before he arrived, which was great. I feel much better now, knowing I got all the much neglected cleaning done around this place. Phew I busted ass today, as I was full of energy unlike any I've seen in a long time! Must be the vitamins I've been taking! Well, all the activities today have worn me out, so I think I'm going to get some much needed rest. Long day tomorrow, and I want to be on my toes, ya know. Nite.

      While Hubbs is in North Carolina golfing with his brother Ron, I have been enjoying a few days of "me time".  I love it, and the bit of freedom it gives me. It's not that I'm even doing anything special, but for a few days I can do what I want, when I want, and his schedual isn't involved. It's just a nice break from the norm. I do miss him alot though. We are together all the time, pretty much the story since we met 26 years ago. So when he is gone, there's a void, that even though I enjoy in small doses, I could not handle being apart from him for a long period of time. It's nice having someone to love, and love you back. Indeed.

      Once again, a search of "Do trees sleep?" brought someone to my site. If this were  even  an option, one would asume that trees also have an awake time. Are some trees morning trees? Really perky in the A.M.?   Maybe some are night owls, or should I say 'night trees", that stay up reeeeeealy late, and then sleep in 'till noon. Hold on a minute...I'm gonna sneak outside and scare the shit out of my sleeping trees! *rolls eyes*  Idiots. I wonder if the full moon has anything to do with this?

      I can't stand one more day without my car. I am going absolutely, freakin' nuts without my car. Nick and his buddy Joel were out in the driveway today working on their cars, and it only seemed to add to my frustration. I know that it's only been away for 5 months, and I do get to drive it for 7, but waiting for 15 more days just seems like an eternity right now. I just can't stand it.

I let them out to run around at least three times a day, and they romp around like little clowns, wrestle eachother, play hide and seek, then crash out after having a snack. Too cute!

      Man, it's gonna be a bitch getting back in the groove at work tomorrow. Three days off, although I do love 'em, are hard to recover from in regards to work. Tomorrow, I'll be lethargic, to say the least. On Thursday, I'll be right back to my usual "killer" self.   Today was a nice day, just getting stuff done around the house. Nothing specific.The only thing that pissed me off, was that one of my Avon customers woke me up with an order this morning, and I really needed/wanted to sleep in. And to boot, the orders were due in by Sunday. I swear these people can't read. Well anyway, I stayed up, did my work-outs and proceded along with laundry, etc. You know, fun shit.    In other news, Nick and Amanda are leaving for Coco (sp?) Beach on Friday for Spring Break . Nice! I know they'll have a wonderful time. That is if my son ever gets his shit packed and ready! Sheesh. I've never been there, but it's really beautiful.....at least in the photos I've seen. I also hope they have good traveling weather, as this time of year it's so unpredictable. I wish I was going, but Nicks car doesn't have a trunk, so stowing away just isn't an option. That, and the last people they want to see there are parents. Can't blame 'em!

      I have been so busy counting the days untill I get my car out of storage, that I haven't been noticing how nice and enjoyable it is to drive my "winter car". Relaxing, actually. It seems I've forgotten the mild  paranoia  that accompanies driving a "classic car", and the work that goes along with it too. Like detailing it every day, all summer.  Every day . I seemed to forget about the worry of someone scratching it while it's parked in a lot somewhere, or some asshole smashing into it on the street. I forgot about peeking out the window all day while at work, to make sure no one's screwing around with it. Now don't get me wrong, I love my Vette, and it's a blast to own and drive, but there's a price to pay also. So I figure I'm just going to enjoy driving my winter ride while I can. It's already scratched, so if someone dings it, hell I won't even notice. I hope no one smashes into it, but if they do, it will piss me off to have the air bag smack me in the face. I haven't washed it all winter, (except for when Hubbs ran it through a car wash a week ago), and it doesn't look bad dirty. All my winter ride wants is a tank of gas, an oil change and washer fluid. That's it. Get in and go. And no need to peek out the window. Not even once!

      Well, after three fabulous days off, (despite the shitty weather), I head back to work tomorrow. My New Yorker started having tranny issues last week, which have yet to be resolved, so I've been driving the "beater truck" as my back-up. The thing looks like hell, but it has a heater, a radio, and gets me where the hell I have to go, so I'm not complaining. Hopefully, the weather will improve enuff that I'll be able to take the Vette when I want to. Not too much has been happening around here lately.......................hence the lack of posts. I have been spending alot of time on ebay, or too much time as my son informs me. Can't help it. I can shop and never leave the house to do it. This is pure fuckin' nirvana to me! Well, I better hit the sheets. Long day tomorow, back with the old crew after switching teams for a month. Should be interesting. Night.

      I'm back! As you can see I've been "tinkering" a bit around here. I've been wanting to change the colors for awhile now, but just wasn't in the mood to piss around with it. I also wrote a couple of entries a few days ago, but my computer decided to vanquish them to some unknown void, so I said f**k it, and didn't re-write them. Again, I wasn't in the mood. I do things by the mood I'm in at the moment, in case you haven't already noticed that. I've really been spending most of my time on Ebay, buying stuff I really want, as March was a good month at work, and I probably won't have the funds I do now again,  'till the end of the year. So I'm buying now. And I'm lovin' it. Ebay is my new addiction.

      Well, I've made it back after a bit of a Blog "layoff', so to speak. I just got tired of writing the same old shit. It will probably be the same old shit again, but what can I say? My life just isn't that damn interesting. Now, if I would have had this stuff around like, 25 years ago, well you'd have been  glued  to my writings! And I would have been in deep shit, I'm sure. So it probably works out for the best that I didn't have this in my younger years. Nuff said about that!   Last night, was one of the nicest times I've had in a long time. My son invited me to join him and his friends when they went on a group cruise. I said yes  instantly , as normally I drive around alone, and the thought of riding around with some other people sounded wonderful! And luckily it was on a night that I wasn't working. We basically drove to MacDonalds on  State Street, as that was the determined meeting spot. We waited around for about an hour till everyone arrived, then stood around and bullshitted awhile, and took photos and video. I felt a bit odd at first, but after awhile, I felt very welcomed and included. We left there, and drove 2 by 2 up State to Peach Street, around Tinsletown Cinema, then over to Brusters and parked in their lot for awhile. Damn, I froze my ass off there, but it was nice just talking and watching  a few of them toss frisbee around. We headed up Peach to Country Fair on a bathroom run, and got coffee and snacks, then back down to State Street, around the dock and over to the Park & Ride to park and hang out some more. From there we went up to 26th street to the Sheetz to get some real food, and sat in the lot till 2:30A.M.. I was dead tired by the time I got home, but I had such a great time that I didn't care. Nicks friends are  just such good people. I wish the people that trash talk youth could see what I saw. What I know, and  have known  for a  long  time. The assholes are  the  minority . Most of todays pierced, tattooed, crazy haired, bass thumping, import driving youth are wonderful people, just trying to express themselves. Hell they should, that's what youth's all about! They'll have they're fuckin' golden years to be bland and boring, damn it. Who the hell needs that shit? Anyway, these guys all have jobs, and pride, and manners. I had a terrific time, and I want to thank all of them for including me in their evening, and treating me like a friend,( who they all call Mom)! I love it and wouldn't want it any other way. P.S.- Thanks for the invite Nick!

      Well, I got my car backk yesterday, after 4 loooonnnnnggggg days apart, and even though I'm thrilled to have her back home, I'm really pissed about a few things. First of all, I was damn mad when I drove by the shop on the second day, and saw her sitting outside overnight! Now, I really thought this guy would have more sense than to leave her outside all night. No alarm, all my papers in the car, sitting out front of the building, all night. Asshole. I was upset.  When I mentioned it to Hubby, he said "Didn't you ask him if he was going to put it inside?" Men.  Then I go and pick her up yesterday, and she's covered in rain spots, mud on the tires, mud on my drivers floor mat. WTF? I pay, and drive her home, where I have to give her a complete detail job, and I discover that not only are there tiny bubble spots in the clearcoat on the door, but the whole fuckin' front end of the car is covered in overspray!!! Now, Hubby just buffed out the whole car about three weeks ago, so feeling the overspray when I was drying her was easy to do. Damn it. Double damn it.  I'm pissed! I'm sure he'll offer to take care of everything for me, but shit, then I'll lose even more driving days because of someone elses  incompetence. I had told him that when I have my whole car painted, I would like him to do it. Screw that. I can't wait to have a little talk with him today.

      I finally get my car back tomorrow, after 4  long  days. Damn I miss my car! I stopped by the shop today, and Tom told me that she'd be ready before noon tomorrow. Great! In case I didn't mention , some asshole hit the drivers door on my Vette with their door, and boogied, leaving a one inch circle of missing paint. Man was I pissed! Especially since I park a freakin' mile away from the stores. No matter what, someone has park right next to me. Anyway, I'll be glad to have her back home again. The weather is finally getting nice and warm, and the rain seems to be going away, so it's time to do some cruising, eh? That's all I can do, as I sure as hell am afraid to stop and park! Kidding. (Thank goodness for comprehensive coverage!)

       Finally,  this Blog stuff is working. For the past few days, there have been problems here where as I couldn't post due to some freakin' errors. I don't know what it was. I normally don't have a helluva lot to say, but then when I do, this damn thing is acting up. I shouldn't bitch though, it is free after all.    Today was a nice day off. Nothing great happened, but it was one of those days where you just feel at ease and relaxed. I got a bit accomplished around the house, with plans on finishing tomorrow after I shop for food. My brother in law will be over here on Saturday, so I'm using that as a reason to get my ass in gear and clean. He won't notice a damn thing, but that's fine with me. I'm just using his visit as pure, selfish motivation. Hell, somethin' gotta move this lazy ass of mine, as I've been putting this stuff off forever. Oh well, I've started, it looks good so far, and that's that.  I went to Target today to get a shower gift for my nephew 's bride-to-be, and I had such a good time looking at all their neat-o stuff along my shopping route. Naturally, after I found their gift, I  had  to pick up a , (well actually a few), tid bits for moi. I found some Lemongrass poutpourri, oil, and incense that I just had to have! HAD TO! I love Lemongrass scent, but never see it anwhere, so I grabbed it when I saw it! I also bought incense called Coastal Mist, that is very nice also. Hmmmmmm. I'll have to go back and get the matching poutpourri now that I'm thinking about it. Best of all, it was marked down!!!! I must admit, I'm one hell of a bargain shopper. Yes I am. (I pride myself on this kinda shit. My world is small. Gimme a break.)

      First of all, it's  still  raining. Storming actually. I don't know if I should go to bed, or start building a friggin' ark. I hate this weather. All in all today wasn't too bad, considering it started off with a 9am bullshit meeting at work. Good news is, we don't have a sales meeting tomorrow morning, so it's kind of a wash out. I came home and took a 2 hour nap (fabulous!), then did some laundry, polished my nails, took out the trash, and watched a bit of TV in between. Nothing exciting, but no one was home all day, so I really had time to myself, to re-group a bit before heading back to work tomorrow. Just going in there today made me realize just how badly I have to get the hell out. It suffocates me after only a few minutes.  So it's off to the grind tomorrow, with my 5 days off, just a memory. Man they went by too fast! Sheesh.   I hope my jacket comes tomorrow, and I really hope it fits. That's the only thing about Ebay. You have to go by someones description and measurements, and hope they're correct. I just love this jacket, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that all will be okay with it. Best part is, it retails new for over $400.00, but I got it for $39.00. Is that great or what? I just love my Ebay!   Well, Hubby should be pulling in any minute, my tanning shit is dry, so I think I'm gonna head off to dreamland. Nite!

      I am bored out of my friggin' skull.  I want a new job. Just to do something new, sounds so exciting to me right now. I am looking forward to visiting my brother in a few weeks. The thought of a road trip, and being in a new place for a couple of days, sounds great.  Boredom sucks.  It feel like winter in reverse.

      Well, as you can see, I've been re-arranging the rooms again! My house looks like shit, but my blog looks good......go figure. I've had 4 days off so far, with one more to go, and I have  no  motivation whatsoever. None. Zip. Of coure maybe it's the fact that I have people around here most of the day, so I find it hard to dig into a project when I'm being asked questions all day. So all my good intentions of getting things accomplished around the house this week, have all been flushed down the shitter. And I can't even go for a relaxing cruise, as it's  still  raining out. Damn it, will it ever stop raining? I just can't stand it any longer. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.

      Well, so far today has been less then interesting, but just the fact that I'm off work makes me giddy. Tomorrow is going to be busy, as I have a 9am meeting at work (assholes), then it's grocery time again, and errands around town to wrap it all up. Hubby's birthday is on Sunday, so I have  alot  of loose ends to tie up where that's concerned.   Today was an odd day. I went along in a kind of haze, just floating throught the hours. Now looking back on it, it's like "Where the hell did the day go?" Sometimes I can be so damn strange.  (I think living with a Gemini and a Scorpio has something to do with my neurosis) Just a thought.

      Nirvana. I'm home from work early, no one is home, and I can do whatever I want for the rest of the evening. Now the question is......do I take a nap, go for a cruise or what?  Hmmmmmm. Maybe a bit of each.  I finally figured out how to get a graphic onto my page! Now I don't know how to move it to other places or anything fancy, but trust me, just getting the damn thing onto my page is a  huge  acomplishment for  me ! Huge. If I get a background to work, I'll probably shit myself with delight! Unless you're Amanda, you have no idea what an ordeal these things are, for a html retard like me.

        Congratulations Nick!!    Hubbs and I drove out to the car show at Enormis on Saturday night, and personally, I had a great time. Nick placing third in his class, and taking home a nice trophy, left me riding home with a big smile on my face! I was really hoping he'd take something home, the kid works so hard on the car, and lord knows he doesn't have alot of cash to work with. There were alot of awesome cars there, so I didn't know how  things would turn out for him. When they announced his name, Amanda and I just  screamed ! This other gal did too, but hell if I can remember her name. She's a sweet person, but my memory just sucks when it comes to names. Anyway, the  three of us screamed and clapped.....loudly! WooooHooo!  This was the first time I had ever been to an Import show, and I must say those cars are really something to see! And when it got dark, and all the neon light came on, it looked like a freakin'n carnival! It was great! (even if my other half acted like a "fud-dud"!)

       Booze and Bouncing!   Nice relaxing day at home today. Nick  fiddled with my car a bit, getting it ready for my trip tomorrow. Got it washed just before the thunder storm rolled in! Then Amanda and Nick arrived, and Amanda made some yummy drinks in her blender.  After a couple of drinks, I got on the damn trampoline, and laughed like a friggin' idiot for the longest time. It really was fun, although I don't think I could do it on a regular basis. Unless of course Amanda shows up with her blender on a regular basis.  Just a thought. We all sat on our street tonight and watched the fireworks, which was a nice ending to a great day. I'll talk to ya when I get back from my road trip on Monday. See ya!

        Don't piss on my parade  There's something in the air tonight, and it aint good. I don't know if it's some bad cosmic vibe or what, but the tension is so thick you can cut it whth a knife. I personally am not a contributor to the bad vibe, but a recipiant of the bullshit.  As usual. And I'm pisses about it, and I need to vent, even if it is into cyberfuckinspace. I am tired of being on the receiving end of peoples messed up lives. See, I try to be a patient, understanding person, going through life trying to make the least amount of waves for people that I possibly can. I try my best to be upbeat, happy, have a positive outlook no matter what the situation. All I ask in return is to not be screwed with. Don't take me for granted. Don't go and mess up my day just cause you feel like it. Some people don't think twice about yelling at me, calling me names, being rude to me,  and playing head games. I don't do this shit to anyone. And yet this is what I get. Is this the price for being nice? I always hope that I can be a good example. But what am is a doormat. I know deep inside that I'm not doing anything wrong, and that it's the trip of the other people, but that doesn't make me feel any better.  I am under a great deal of stress everyday at work, something that no one around here seems to understand. They all think it's in my head. Sometimes I don't think I can bear another day there, yet I hang in  and try to give it another try. I do my best. Even dealing with anxiety attacks on occasion. For years, I listened to others talk about their jobs, and never was anything but supportive about their decisions. I don't think they could last at my job for a month.  The only true calm time I have is when I'm driving my Vette. I don't think about anything else but the ride. Sadly, I can't do this as often as I would like. Or as often as other people persue their hobbies. I guess I could, but I don't like to  put  things aside to do so. See, I have laundry, shopping, beds to make, a house to clean, a dinner to make, etc. And I get asked why I didn't cut the grass! WTF?  Are you kidding me?!  I'm not cutting the goddamn grass.  It's just the principle of the whole thing. If I'm not appreciated for all I do now, why should I throw lawn work on to the heap? I may be nuts, but I'm no asshole. Cut the grass your own damn self. In fact, the friggin' grass can grow taller than the house, and I wouldn't give a damn.   Right now I feel like getting in my car and driving to Mexico or someplace crazy. I feel like I want to scream. All the way to Mexico. And drink Tequila for a week.   People need to get their shit together, not just share theri neurosis with me, and bring me down too. Talking about it is one thing, but then they gotta do something to change their situation. Me listening to them, and being their sounding board isn't gonna mane their life better. It only makes me feel like shit. And hitting them upside the head. Maybe I just gotta get mean. I do have it in me, I just don't like to deal that way. I'm not a bad vibe kinda person, and I find it hard to send out nastiness. It's not my style. But lately, I'm running out of options, and unleashing my fury may be my only option.  That and picking up a bottle of Tequila.

      Hey, I'm back! But you gotta bear with me here, because this place is going through some major changes, like  I  have in the past few weeks, and I don't know how fast I'm going to get everything done. But I will get it all done as soon as I can. I've missed being here. Things are more frustrating to me now than they used to be. I know that will get better over time. That' part of the reason this will take a bit of time. I get pissed at simple shit really easily right now. It'll be okay though.  This  will help me along. Peace.

      What a beautiful day for the end of October! I have shorts on for goodness sakes. I can't remember the last time it was this warm, at this time of year. Awesome is the only word that can describe this weather. Nick and Amanda left for Niagara Falls this evening, and I'm happy to say that Nick called around 10:30 or so and said that they were in their room relaxing. Amen. I just can't relax till i get that "We're in" call.  Untill you're a parent, you don't understand how much rides on that one call. Anyway, I hope they have a fabulous time, and remember to stash lots of hotel freebies in their bags! (You know....shampoos, soaps, etc.)   Trick or Treat was nice this evening, but I don't think we really had that many kids, considering how great the weather was. I was really surprised. I have a hell of alot of candy left over. Too bad I can't enjoy it as much as I used to. Hmf.

      It was sooo beautiful today, I just had to take the Vette out for a couple of drives. One of them was to my doctor, for a check up, and for him to sign my return to work paper. Everything checked out ok, except my liver enzyme levels were a bit elevated  due to my meds, so I have to keep an eye on that.  Always something. The rest of the day was rather blah, doing nuthin' special but a bit of last minute yard winterizing. Wooohooo, fun shit. I went to the Dollar Tree tonight and got the wrapping items I need for Nicks birthday gifts, so I'm happy to have that off my "to do" list. Now I'm going to put bitsy to bed, get a hot shower and perhaps watch a bit of TV.

It's always a sad day when I have to put her in winter storage.  No fun till Spring, and that sucks ass. Well, I'm not gonna think about that now. I gotta figure out where I'm gonna cruise to tomorrow. Hmmmmmm. It really doesn't matter, as no matter where I go, I'll have a shit eatin' grin of happiness on my face.

      Well, three more lovely days left untill my feet once again cross the threshold into retail insanity. I have to keep telling myself that hopefully I'll only be there a month, and I can make it through, with my sanity in tact. If my boss even thinks of cutting me slack due to my health issue, I swear I'll lose it.  I need to be out of that place pronto. No looking back. Ever.  One thing I will certainly miss once I start work again, is watching the   urlLink Sharon Osbourne Show  in the morning, on my bed with Bitsy, as I have my coffee and I feed Bitsy her Puppy Chow breakfast . Over the past month and a half, this has become our morning routine, and we really enjoy it. I even catch Bits watching the show from time to time! The show is  awesome . If you haven't seen it yet, you need to check it out at least once.

      I decided at the  last minute  to stop at the Mall yesterday on my way home from my cardio workout. Well, as I'm looking around in Spencers, who should pop up righ next to me? Amanda! What a nice surprise. We walked around together for awhile, then she headed out and so did I. Then,  I got the notion to stop at the party store while I was in the area, and who did I run into there? Joy from work, who has been out on disability just like me. I haven't seen her since Sept. 11th when I had my heart attack, so we hugged and screamed and hugged and smiled in disbelief. We were just so happy to see eachother! Weird shit.

             Well, I guess the best way to start any story is from the beginning. The only problem is, and this is why I'm not a friggin' writer, is that I'm not a detail person. I don't like to write in detail, I should say.  So, in lieu of alot of details, I'll just stick to the facts.    Over the past few months, alot of changes have been occuring in my world. Some good, and some not so good. As far as the good goes, our family got a new addition in August.  Her name is Bitsy, and she's a feisty, and adorable chihuahua/schnauzer/??? mixed little mutt. She's such a joy to have around, although at times she wears us out with all her energy, and puppy curiousity. I'd forgotten how much work a new puppy is, even though the rewards far outnumber the frustrating times. Still, she can be a handful. Especially in the nipping department. She's 4 months old now, and nipping is one of her bad habits that we're trying to get control of. Her puppy teeth are sharp as nails, and when she takes a bite at your nose..............that shit hurts!! Anyway, we love her to "bits"!!   As usual, I've always been one to be full of surprises. Well I had one hell of a surprise on September 11th. I had a heart attack at 9PM on the way home from work. Like I said before, I'm not a detail person, so again I'll just give the facts. First and foremost, I'll always be eternally grateful to my son Nick for taking control of the situation, and calmly getting me help, and staying with me untill 4:30 in the morning, when I was finally admitted to a room. I'll never forget his bravery, in what had to be a totally freaked out situation for him. The 4 days I spent in the hospital are pretty much a blurr now....... of restless nights, endless bloodwork and blood pressure tests, Hubby, Nick amd Amanda visiting me, the lady in my room gasping for air and gagging day and night, and bland hospital food. My only respit was down the hall in the visitors lounge where they had a computer with internet access. At least I could limp down and check my e-mail and some of my favorite sites to pass the time. I limped because my right leg was sore from the procedure where they inserted two stents into a vein in my heart. They go up into an artery in your leg to do this. I don't remember the surgery as the meds just knocked me flat. I was really glad to be let out of tht place. You can't get any fuckin' sleep there!  So anyway, here I am, feeling pretty damn good, and pretty much back to "normal" except for no heavy lifting, and being on a low fat diet. Oh yeah, and Cardio Rehab three times a week, which I find to be a royal pain in my ass. thank god that will end in like a week or so. As far as work is concerned, I go back next Saturday, which I'm dreading beyond belief. I hope I can sweat out this month, get fired, and collect unemployment for at least 26 weeks, while I look for a job I will enjoy going to everyday. Or not, we'll see. Hubbs says I really don't have to work if I don't want to, and he's really enjoyed me being at home this month and a half. I must say, I have too. But  I know that sooner or later, I'd have to get out of the house.  I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

      Now lemme see what I was doing 21 years ago at this time. I was in Magee Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. We went in at 4am, as labor was to be induced.  Nick was actually due on October 18th. I finally got into a room around Noon, if you can imagine that! To make a long story short, many labor pains and a welcomed epidural later,  Nick was born at 3:02 pm, measuring 21'' and weighing 6lb. 13oz. What a beautiful baby boy! It was the happiest day of my life. Seeing him turn 21, is another. Love you Nick.

      Working on sunday sucks no matter where you work. I hate it, always have and always will. So my day started with that mind set. The day seemed to drag, even though we were pretty busy, and my aching feet didn't help matters at all. I made  it through, I made a few sales, and I made it home again. A good day indeed. Now, three days off! Woooooo!

      Things went pretty well today, but I must say it was a bit rough getting back into the mindset of selling again. In fact, there were alot of things that I had forgotten all together! But before  I knew it, everything came back to me. The nicest part of my day was that everyone was genuinely happy to see me, and needless to say, that made me feel pretty good inside. It's a,ways nice to know you're missed. I will miss my friends, as dysfunctional as they are, when I leave that place.

      Well, I'm back  again . Gotta get used to this, because I come and go. I'm into this, then I'm not. That's just the way it is with me. And not just with this journal stuff, but with everything in life. I get bored and lose interest in things alot. It's unnerving to me, but I just go with the flow and see where I end up. I never know, so that's what keeps it interesting. I need interesting. But then there's the part of me that loves the comfort of predictability. Damn I'm a confusing person. Therein lies the kaliedescope part. Just shake the damn thing, and everything changes. You never know what it's going to look like or if you'll like it. That's my life. That's what's inside my head. Never a dull moment in this cranium of mine.

      Well, everything about my brothers visit was  awesome , execpt the weather. It was cold, damp and dreary.....less than perfect, but we really didn't notice, as we were so happy to spend time together. I know he had a good time, because he spent the night, which he wasn't planning to do in the beginning. He hit the road around 6:30 AM on Sunday morning. The day mostly consisted of Mike sitting outside with Hubby and Jr. while Hubbs was working on Jr's car, which Mike enjoyed alot because first of all he loves car shit, and this gave him a chance to talk "motorhead" stuff with the guys, second he got to spend time with Jr, who he hasn't seen in quite awhile. We had lunch, then Mike and I ran up to WalMart for a few things, (there was this cool hat I saw there the other day, but as luck would have it.....gone!), then we hung out at the house for a bit. Mike wanted to go up to the lake while he was here, so around 2:30 or so we headed up to Erie to check out the lake.  (To be continued.....)

      My brother Mike is coming up to visit us tomorrow and I'm really looking forward to it! Especially since he hasn't been here since Nicks grad party in 2001. Wow! That's a long time between visits, eh? Anyway, he's gonna pick up Nicks "old" computer desk to put in his spare room/office to be. I can tell he's really excited to come up, or as he put it "Road trip"!!! He's been through sooo much over the past year, with getting divorced and all the adjustments that go along with it. And he's had a really tuff time financially this winter. Poor guy needs a break already. He's such a great guy too. We have alot of time to make up for, as he and I have missed out on alot of years together. (Very long story there!)  Anyway, gotta get things dusted off a bit around here. He said he might get here around 7:30 in the morning tomorrow. Is he fuckin' nuts or what?? I don't even know where I am at 7:30 anymore. Sheesh, I hope I can sway him to get here a tad bit later. *fingers crossed*

      I have to go grocery shopping, and I'm dragging my feet, as this is my least favorite thing to do. I don't have much choice though, as the cupboards are almost bare. Damn, if there's a shopping fairy, I wish she'd drop in now. (Ha! Just as I typed shopping fairy, I thought of Christopher Lowell!!)

      "Bitsy the terror" is wearing me out!! Having a puppy is more exhausting than having a kid! At least my son would sit in front of the TV and watch some shows or a video. This dog wants to be by my side at all times. I love her to pieces, but she's wearing me down fast!!

      I can't seem to find anything to peak my interest lately. My attitude is bland.....and I hate bland with a passion. I love having a spark, zest, zing. Right now I'm trying to find my "zing".

      WTF? Why is it that one day I can look at myself, and think I look ok....and the next day, think I look like shit? What the hell is that all about? What goes on upstairs that just changes our perception of things? Like overnight. I hate whatever it is, and I wish it would go away forever. I just don't want it to leave while I think I look like shit.

      Man I feel great today! I know it has to do with the weather change, because the dreary days of Winter really bring me down. It's a constant battle to keep myself motivated and in decent spirits. I got down to hard core working out last night, and I feel great about it, and comitted to following through with it every morning and night. I've put on a few pounds & inches since I got out of the hospital, and I friggin' hate  it! But I didn't put on so much that it won't be a breeze to shake off if I just give it some effort. Getting started is always a bitch for me, but once I get rollin' ,watch the hell out!   This Winter mood shit sucks big time. I would really love to do the 6 months here and 6 months in Florida "Snowbird" routine. Maybe someday. I mean somedays I don't want to be in the house, but I don't want to go out either. Nothing motivates me, and I just want to nap untill Spring arrives. Whoa.

      I went to get my eyes checked yesterday, and I had a blast! My eyes checked out ok as far as glaucoma and all that stuff is concerned, but I do need glasses for reading and driving. No shit. I found the  greatest  frames that I just  love , and the guy who helped me pick out the frames was a hoot! He was obviously gay, and kept saying "They look fabulous on you!" about some of the frames I tried on. It was fun! I can't wait till they come in next week. The only thing is that they're bi-focals and I'm wondering if they're gonna be a pain in the ass to get used to. We'll see I guess.

      Reading web pages where people either can't friggin' spell, or they're too damn lazy to care about checking their spelling is getting on my nerves big time. I mean, there are some sites that I swear it looks like a bunch of 5 year olds are at the keyboard. And I know for a fact that these folks are in their late 20's and 30's. Okay, I'll shut up now.

      I just found out tonight that my brother is having a small get-together at his house for my nephew Mikeys birthday. I'm almost having an anxiety attack just thinking about being around my chain-smoking brother. Oh boy, this might be rough. No, this is gonna be rough, but I guess I have to go through it to get through it, if you know what I mean. Damn, some days are a bitch.

      Sometimes I can't fathom how much some women spend on things.....clothes, shoes, make-up, etc. It just blows my mind when I hear some chick mention paying over $200.00 for shoes or $100.00 for a top or $25.00 for lipstick. Huh? Did I miss something here? I don't know, but the thought of paying those prices makes my skin crawl. Those things  just aren't worth that much . Even if I was filthy rich, I would have one hell of a time with some of those high prices. The only, well a couple of, big splurges I would have if I was dripping in cashola, would be a driver and a cleaning-man. Oh yeah. Give me a sec...I'll think up a few more.

      I have taken a liking to making bundt cakes lately. Dunno why. I made a strawberry with whipped strawberry icing one today, and I must say it looks very yummy. As far as the country mucic is concerned, don't worry it's just a phase. I guess I got a bit tired of the rap, old rock and/or pop crap. So I switched it up for a couple of days. One thing I must say though, is country music sure has some pretty love songs. I guess I'm feeling mushy today. Another phase. Jeeze.

      Stressful day today. For no reason in particular, and for everything in general. Some days, like today, everything just seems to come crashing down, making me feel like I'm buried alive and I can't breathe. I want to get out of my skin and run away, from the feeling of panic, but then knowing there's nowhere to run stirs the panic even more. Damn hormonal bullshit combined with this nicotine cessation is a real bitch to deal with. Some days it's a breeze and others, pure hell. I made it through though, with  alot  of reassuring words from Hubby, an Ativan, a hot shower and hopefully, a good nights sleep. Hubbs wants me to ride down to the 'Burgh with him tomorrow to visit with my folks 'till Saturday evening, but I don't know if I'm into that, with the way I've been feeling lately. Lord knows I want to see my parents. I haven't had a decent visit with them in a long while. I just don't know if I can do the overnight thing. Lately, it doesn't take much to throw me into a spin. I don't need that to happen at my folks house. they have enuff stuff to handle, without me having a panic attack while I'm visiting. A daytrip yeah....I just don't know about staying over. What to do?

      Well, Sex in the City is over for tonight, and as always, I enjoyed it totally. Hell, even the fact that all the chicks in it are skinny doesn't bother me. I always walk away with a smile.  "I wonder if models repel" was my favorite saying tonight.   Speaking of chuckles, I've been checking out this Outback Jack show, and I've never laughed so much over a show before in my life. First of all,  where the hell do they find these women ? I can't even believe that there are actually bubble-headed broads like this on the planet. Hmmm, I need to get out more. The fact that they made these air headed bimbos jump out of an airplane to get to the Outback, pleased me to no end. And the fact that they all had evening gowns on that they had to tuck into their jumpsuits, almost made me piss my pants. Then, after they landed from their jump, they had to hike through the outback in their strappy high heels. This is too good to be true. From there, they all screamed ,ran about flailing their arms, whined and complained about everything and anything...especially the first base camp & the bugs. As one "Bubble-Head" put it, "I thought I was going to a 5 star spa or something. I'm just not used to this  at all ". Shoot me now. Oh, but I gotta see what happens to the princesses next week. The humanity.

      I can't believe this shit. In fact, it happened to me twice! Here's the story. I wanted to join this support group for quitting smoking. It has a forum and chat and stuff and I thought that it would benefit me to talk to others who have quit, especially when I'm having on of my rough times. Well, their directions are sketchy for getting into this "group", as far as these pledge forms you have to fill out and shit. I couldn't find a link, I didn't know it was a copy & pate thingy. Good fuckin' grief. Hell, if all this aggravation to join the quit smoking forum doesn't make you wanna light up again, nuthin' will sister. (No I didn't do it....Not gonna happen here.) Back to story. So I fill in all this shit, and send it back and guess what???????? I get fuckin'  rejected  not only once.... but 4 times !!!! Can you believe that shit??? I'm soooo pissed. I wanted to write them a nasty letter, but I think then I'll just sound like an asshole, and they'll just say "Well we don't need the likes of psycho bitch on our boards anyway". Yet I'm still pissed. What to do?AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH! Their name is  urlLink WhyQuit.com.  Hell yeah, after they get done with you , that's the question your asking yourself......why friggin'quit??????AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!  Here's an excerpt from the letter they sent me:  "We've received your application to join Freedom but unfortunately must deny it as it does not contain the important information requested in our left margin link page entitled "Join after 72 hours."

I really think I'm gonna write that letter.

      Damn I'm pissed. I was at WalMart tonight, when I happened upon a rack of Levis for $5.00 apiece. Now I mean  original  Levis.....so you know what a hell of a deal this is. Well, they had my size, and a tall to boot..........the friggin' size I was wearing 10 months ago before I started eating like it's going out of fuckin' style, and now my ass won't fit into any of the clothes I love.  Damn it . Is it obvious that I'm  way  pissed? Well, the good news is that I've started working out again.... the bad news is that it probably won't show until friggin' November when I won't give a damn. Oh, going on 10 days without puffing. Woot woot!! I'm smoke free, and have a big ass. Why can't things just be simple? Huh?

      I had a fun day today.....doing the birthday thing for Bitsy kind of gave me something to look forward to. Thing get kinda boring around here. Predictable. So today was a nice break from the ordinary stuff. Bitsy had fun too....I don't care who thinks I'm nuts. Don't care.   I watched SITC againt tonight, and I think Pat watched it too, as I mentioned it to her today and she said she'd check it out. I'm anxious to see if she liked it or not. That show makes me realize something. I didn't have enuff girlfriend time as I was growing up. In fact, I really had very little. For some odd reason, I really didn't like "chicks" much. I mean I hung out with a few along the way, but I mostly had guy friends. Now looking back, I regret that. That is one thing I would change if I could.

      Yesterday was my one week "smoke free" milestone, so Hubby took me out for chinese to celebrate. I  really  enjoyed it, especially it seems like it's been a long time since we've been there.....and I have been craving it for awhile now. Anyway it was good.   The not smoking thing is really going well, in fact so well that it really surprises me when I think about it. I still have moments when I get blind-sided by the urges, and they're a bitch when they come along, but all in all, it's going along great. I can go  hours  and it doesn't even cross my mind. I can't believe that. I never thought I'd be able to say that. Hours.

The only thing that has me confused, is why are they running episode one next week instead of this week? Like tonight.  I don't get the reasoning behind it. Hmmm. Am I a dumbass for not getting it? Anyway, I really enjoyed the show, and how I was able to escape my "little boring life" for awhile. I need that sometimes.  Nah. I really mean  alot .

      I went for a cruise in the Vettster last night with the t-tops off. Fantastic! I drove up to Erie, around the Bayfront to the Dock and back, and it was so relaxing, I didn't want it to end. Funny thing happened as I was approaching 79......I saw a new Vette flying up on my left, and I thought "Aw shit, just keep going and don't give me any grief".  Well, I caught a red light with the "New and improved Vette", and when I reluctantly looked over...it was two grey haired fellas,(I'm guessing to be around mid 60's or so!) laughing their asses off just having a blast tooling around town, in their Vette. I couldn't help but get a big grin, and I gave em a thumbs up. Way to go guys, that's what life's all about! Made my night. (I was relieved they didn't want to race!!)

      Well, as of 1am this morning it will be six days of no smoking for me. This is a miracle, especially since I'm doing it "cold turkey" to boot. I never figured I could do this without help of some sort. Go figure. It's not easy, believe me, but it's very rewarding. I literally have to go from minute to minute, as one moment everything is great, and the next I'm  suddenly blindsided  by a terrible urge....and I get anxious for awhile. Sometimes I get really pissed. I have to take deep breaths 'till it passes, which even though it only takes a few moments, sometimes it feel like  forever . Being addicted to something sucks. Getting away from it is no easy matter, but I know I can do this. I will not go back. I've come too far now. I just need to make it through today.

      I went to one of my  favorite  shopping haunts today, and even though I really didn't feel like shopping due to my cold, once I got there and started looking around, well damn it felt great! I went to Gabes to get Hubbs some gifts for his birthday, but also to look for a few goodies for myself. It's been months since I've bought anything other than household stuff and groceries. Well, I must say I did pretty well as I found a great pair of Faded Glory white shorts, two cute bangle bracelets, a great sparkly fun ring, an awsome pair of sunglasses and a pair of dragonfly earring that shouted "BUY US NOW!!!", so I did. and the best part is I got it all for........drumroll please.......$13.00!! Oh yeah! No buyers remorse here. It felt great, and I must admit I forgot all about my miserable cold the whole time I was shopping. Oh yeah, I did get Hubbs a few things for his birthday, but I still need to find a few more items on the list. I need to do this more often. I had a blast. See, laughters not the  only  best medicine, now is it? Goodies from my shopping trip&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Woohoo!&nbsp;I won the black shawl I was bidding on. Auctions are sooo exciting and addicting. I'm done with the shawls now that I have the two colors I want. Plus, the lady who has them is wising up and upping her starting bids. Someone must have told her she was not asking enuff for them. Lucky me, I got in and out just in time. Story of my life. Really.

        Well, the family reunion has come and gone for another year, and other than the all day rain, I think it was a nice day. At least I had a pretty good time.&nbsp; Well, the chicken and all the side-dishes were&nbsp; good.&nbsp; Hubby and I stayed at my parents last night, and other than Bitsy waking me up at 5 friggin' AM , then 7AM, then 8:45 AM, to stand out in the backyard, in my pajamas, doing nuthin', no pee, no poop, no friggin' nuthin', I slept pretty well! I'm glad to be home though. I'd like to go down to my folks for a couple of days alone, just to hang out, and&nbsp; help them around the house with a couple of things.&nbsp; There's a few things that could use a good cleaning, and I like scrubbing someone elses house alot better than my own! Much more interesting indeed. So maybe in a few weeks I'll head down for a little visit. For now, I'm heading to dreamland, as I'm tired from all those early morning activities.&nbsp; *yawm* Goodnight!&nbsp; ;)

      I had a nice day yesterday. Nuthin' special, just one of those days where you're very content just being "homey", if you know what I mean. I cleaned a bit, washed clothes a bit, baked some super yummy brownies, put a vintage bedspread from my grandma on my bed for a summer change,(It looks very "cottage-y"), went to the church store to browse, and came home with $3.40 worth of "treasures", and then cooked a wonderful fried fish dinner, that I must say, was the  best  I've ever made. Hubby agreed. I told him it was due to the $.79  fish breading mix I got at WalMart last week. I  will  stock up on that stuff. Damn it was good! I accidentally burned my arm with hot oil, as I was frying the fish. That sucked. I'll live. All in all, a neat day. Muggy as hell(literally) outside though. What do I know. Maybe hell has dry heat, like Phoenix. Anyway, I'm so glad we have our little air conditioner chugging away in the living room.  Humidity and I have never been very good friends. In fact, we loathe eachother.

      I really need to do some serious needless spending, but no job = no fun shopping trips. Ugh. I've been in a really terrible state of mind lately, and I think that getting out and about amongst the costume jewelry, the racks of bright summer clothing, and all the delightful accessories would lift my spirits, all right. Only problem is cashola. $$$$$.  I think I need to get a job soon. I'm thinking Fall, if I can hold out that long.

      I used to love watching MTV. I loved it when you could actually see music videos. Do you remember when you could see music videos on MTV? Damn it seems like ages ago, doesn't it? I tuned in tonight, and I saw a  dreadful  show about Jessica Simpsons sister, Ashlee. I just don't know what to say. Like having Jessica on a show isn't bad enough.
