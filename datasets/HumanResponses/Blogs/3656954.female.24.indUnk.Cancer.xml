        Say it. You don't take hints. We know this. Here's some information for you, neither do we. Especially when dealing with boys whom we count as friends. Any hints you make about "liking" or wanting to date us, we immediately disregard as friendly jesting. You see, we don't want to read into anything and make the friendship awkward for no reason, so we disregard it. Our natural tendency is to read into everything, so with our friends we try to go completely opposite and not read into ANYTHING.(Also, on some level, I think most of us figure that our friends know too much about us to ever want to date us). Therefore, if, for some reason, you decide you are interested in one of your friends, as more than a friend, you are going to have to make yourself crystal clear. Otherwise, she's not going to know.

          It's very scary, being placed up high on a pedestal. Especially when you know that you can't possible remani there. At any time, you may do something to cause the collapse of the pedestal and end everything in pain.  We don't want to be worshipped, well, most of us don't. The best thing I've ever heard involved some very candid observation of a glaring fault of mine, followed by advice on how to work on it, followed in turn by a statement that let me know I was still loved.  I know that was extremely vague, but as I said before, no names, no specific circumstances will be disclosed.  My point is, we have faults. They may not be as bad as yours (just kidding) but we do have them. We want to be loved just the way we are, faults and everything included. Feel free to tell us how wonderful we are ;), just know that our wonderfulness includes the flaws of a fallen human race.

        If you're one of my friends, I already have enough respect for you to believe that you are looking for an intelligent girl, not just a pretty one (although I'm quite sure none of you would uncover the first without first being drawn by the second but that is not the point).  The point is, intelligent girls like to be treated like intelligent girls. Talk to us about important things. Ask what we think. Display interest in our opinions, and when they differ from yours, debate with us in a calm intelligent manner. (that way we can find out if you are in fact intelligent enough for us :) ). Seriously, this may seem insignificant to you, but it's monumental for us. Alot of men tend to automatically condescend when dealing with women. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a feminist. Please be stronger, please be better at fixing things like my car, please be a man. I have no interest in being a man, but I'm not the tin man either. We have brains, they're good ones. We like to use them. That's all, that's my tip.

         Actually had work to do at work, amazing. That was nice actually. It made the time go faster. Buckets of rain poured from the skies in Clemson today... did anyone else notice? I love rain. It makes me happy. Is that backwards? I don't know, it's so soothing... anyway. I'm in for a crazy rest of the week. CRAZY. I'll keep you posted.      By the way, Katie, thanks for commenting. :)

         My Jodie is coming back today. She's been gone for a WEEK. I'm really glad she got to go visit Ryan, but I missed her. Jodie is my oh-so-fabulous, completely irreplaceable roommate, made especially for me. :) I could not begin to describe us, nor would I want to because no doubt everyone would be confused. I'll just say she's wonderful, and when she's gone I miss her terribly.     One thing I love about Clemson, is that it's really not unusual to pass someone you know when you driving around town. It makes me happy. It makes it seem like I have so many friends that I'm just bound to run into one of them no matter what I'm doing.      I spent about an hour this morning digging in the dirt, collecting worms, and then playing with them. This is one of Emmett's favorite games, and actually, it's one of mine too. It's just fun. You should try it.     Did I mention that my Jodie is coming back today? :-D

          Friday night: good times at Blockbuster with my red apron man. Casey, another blockbusterian, provided some amusement with his shock over the un-indentical-ness(i know, not a word)of the Olsen twins and the name of his hypothetical band. I am not at liberty to disclose the name of this hpothetical band lest some jerk come along and steal the name off my blog and attach it to their real band. I left work at 10 in a distressing emotional slump, not to worry, I have great friends. John, Matt, Raphael, and Katie took it upon themselves to cheer me up. Off we went to Ruby Tuesdays, where we ate dessert and called a drunk guy and told him that Katie is now a man. haha. good times. Later we watched the Emperor's New Groove, always good for a laugh. Finished up the day and dreamt my way into the next on 12 hours of much needed sleep.      On to Saturday: rising at 2, I spotted Sean online and harrased him into disclosing the Odd Fellows Home plans for the day. They were heading to the spot, so I invited myself along. More good times ensued. drunk rednecks abounded, but, as always, the spot was great. Then off to work I went, where I was visited by...JENNY!!!! and Katie (equally exciting but not quite as uncommon)They picked out 5 movies and then I joined them later at Katie's to watch one. House of Sand and Fog. thought provoking, depressing, definitely not an after 12 at night movie.     Sunday: Church - wonderful. Columbo's for lunch. Off to the spot for a quick swim. On to church for a music meeting and night church. Then Patirck and I went over to Katie's and sang for 2 and 1/2 hours. That was so wonderful. I want to do that everyday. I slept until 11 this morning.       It was a good weekend. One cloud. I missed Clark. Good thing he's back now :)

        I forgot how much fun it is to meet new people. Last night I worked at the Blockbuster off of the 28 bypass in Anderson. I met Jeff. Jeff is a 29 year-old who quit his job as a quality engineer (too stressful) to go to work for his uncle, who owns a golf-cart accessories business. Now he makes golf cart accessories. It's a low pressure job with security. When Jeff was a kid, he always wanted to sing, but he said he always had a terrible voice so that was out of the question. (I believe this was a self-deprecating distortion of the truth. My belief is based on what follows.) About 3 years ago, the youth pastor at Jeff's church called him. He said he knew that Jeff played the guitar, and wanted to know if he would help lead worship for the youth group on Wednesday nights. Jeff agreed. Now Jeff plays and sings every Wednesday night. He also has his own band. They've performed at several churches, many times at the Carpenter's Cellar in downtown Greenville, and at other coffee shops around Anderson. He wrote a song for his sister's wedding. He sang for both of his sisters' weddings. He has a 9 year-old daughter. He loves movies, goes to them alone usually, except chic-flics - he takes his daughter to those or waits for them to come out on video. Nice guy.       Wasn't that fun? I learned all of that in between 5 hours of great customer service and checking in and putting away movies. The other neat part about all of this is that Jeff knows virtually nothing about me. It seems I have a knack for this. I can get information out of almost anyone, but I think I could count on one hand (2 maybe if I streched it, but there would certainly be no need for toes) the number of people who actually know anything significant about me, anything that would not be apparent after spending an hour with me. Fascinating.

         Last night I hung out with the boys. This is what I learned. 1.   I am not cute 2.   I am not innocent 3.   The reson I am neither cute nor innocent is somehow related to the fact that I like good beer. 4.   One pitcher of beer between two people is not enough. 5.   I'm not good at drawing. 6.   What I am good at (if anything) is up for debate.  7.   Flip-flops and hiking to The Spot in the dark are not a good combination. 8.   If presented with an opportunity to fall, I probably will. Apparently I don't have very good balance. 9.   Spiders like to build their webs right in the middle of the path and right at face-level. 10.  Never walk in front. 11.  Never turn your back on a boy. 12.  If you're tired enough, you can sleep through a jam session. 13.  Andy secretely does not hate me as much as he pretends to. 14.  Some things are funny no matter who you are. 15.  Explorers has good wings.

         Everyone should have at least 7 belly laughs a day. (A belly laugh is when you laugh all the way down into the bottom of your stomach, you know it if you do it) Pretty much, that's how I always laugh. After all, anything worth doing and all that.  Did you know that? Did you know you needed 7 a day? It's for your health, this is a public service announcement.      Last night I watched Cold Mountain with Katie and Rachel. IF you haven't seen it, you should. It's a great movie. Drama, action, comedy, it has it all. I was personally involved with all the characters within the first 30 minutes of the movie (that's not really saying alot I guess, I become personally involved in every movie I see, but Katie stayed awake and that IS saying quite alot really).  Here's a taste to spark your interest. "ooooh. That man's so full of manure, you could lay him in the dirt and grow another one just like him." (spoken with a southern/back woods/mountains accent) I'm going to HAVE to use that in everyday conversation. I just won't be able to help myself.      Also last night... 2 am. My phone rings. Dazed, sleepy, and completely non-coherrent, I answer. It's Benjamin. "Hey, are you sleeping?"  "No," I reply. (Now, 10 minutes later, when my brain finally caught up to the conversation I'd had, I realized that I had said no when he asked if i was sleeping. Why? The only thing I could come up with is that in my more than slithly cloudy state of mind, I could only think that at that exact moment I was not sleeping, even though 2 seconds before, I had been.) Back to 2 am... "Oh really?, I thought you'd be alseep." (which begs the question, why did you call?) "But I called any way,"said Benjamin,"we're at Lindsey's are we're going to watch The Goonies. Want to come over?" (any normal person would have said "no, I'm just going to go back to sleep now. thanks for calling. bye") BUT, I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, anything even close to resembling normal, so of course I  thought about it for about 30 seconds and then said, "Ok, I'll be there in a minute." Good times. By the way, please call at 2 am anytime, I love surprises.

          Dollars, that is. Anyone possesing and willing to give me either of these things, please do so. I'm in need. Picture this...          Your car breaks down, again, but this time it's in the middle of the road and not starting back up. Most of you know that in the past month or so I have had more car trouble than really I could have hope to have in a year. Apparently when it rains it pours. And oh the variety. Alternator, battery, oil cooler, water pump, and now the radiator - but not the whole radiator because that would just be a little over the top. OH, and I've been informed that you can't walk into a car repair place and say "My car is sick". Not true. If you are a guy, no way, you can't do that. But I am me and oh so cute and charming and when I have spent the last two hours trying to get my car to said repair place and I no longer have the energy nor the inclination to explain it's problems yet again, I can say whatever I want to. Especially when there's someone standing right next to me who is perfectly capable of doing the talking. Anyway, also my headlight is out, but no worries I have a replacement in the front seat of the car.      Yesterday, as I was hanging out in the grass near the intersection of Perimeter and 76, I saw Jodie, Lindsey Mann, and Rebekah Wright, all of whom made sure I was ok. Thanks, it's nice to know that it seems the chances, of someone you know passing by if you have car trouble in Clemson, are pretty good. It turns out the people at the Armory are very nice too. It was no problem at all for John and I to use the kitchen sink to fill containers with water. John, by the way, was a saint. Most of you probably don't know John, but yesterday he spent about 2 hours with me. Without his help, the adventures would most likely would have lasted alot longer and caused considerably more stress. As it was, it was kind of fun.       I'd like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude for all of you who have come to my aid in these recent times of car distress. I want everyone to know how great my friends are. Clark has been oh so very good to me. You see, Clark not only picked me up and took me to and from work and in between jobs several times, he also drove me TO GREENVILLE to pick up my car from the shop. Not to mention all the times he's picked me up just so I could hang out with everyone while I was carless. Ben and Clark spent at least 30 minutes one night looking under my hood and actually crawling underneath my car looking for an oil leak. (I'm pretty sure they found that entertaining, but I still appreciate it). Ben picked me up from Blockbuster in the middle of the night and drove me to Wal-mart to buy 15 quarts of oil so I could get my car to the shop in Greenville. Katie, angel that she is, has let me borrow her car twice. Not only was this very very sweet of her, but also oh so much fun for me since I rarely get the opportunity to drive a stick shift. Jodie has also rearranged her schedule to drive me around, this morning she got up early just so I wouldn't have to ride my bike to babysit. And of course, my Daddy, who had not once refused me mechanical advice when asked and never ignores my calls or pretends he's not there even though I'm sure he's wondering when I am going to leave him alone and learn to take care of myself. I don't think I left anyone out. You are all so great! Thank you, thank you, thank you.         By the way, I have been informed that every lemon needs a name, and as my dear vehicle is yet nameless I have a dilemma. So, I am now taking suggestions of names for my car. For anyone who has not met my car, he (anything this dysfunctional must be a boy) is a '93 dark green chevy blazer. Please, no cracks about American made cars. They're old and mostly non-funny.

         I've decided to add free tips to my blog. Apparently there are quite a few things that someone should really tell the guys, but of course we're all much too polite to single any of them out and tell them what's wrong with them to their faces. So, I think I'll just post a free tip on my blog everyday until I run out of free tips. What do you think? If you think this is a bad idea, please let me and I'll discontinue it. You can find the free tips by clicking on the "free tips" link.

         I am me. My life is not scintilating, fascinating, or interesting really in anyway at all, unless of course you are me, and then you find that it truely is all those things and more.  I received a request for an update on my life as me, so here it goes.          Currently I am employed on a regular basis at three different locations and picking up part time work as it comes along. These three locations are, the Huddleston home, the Brooks Center, and Blockbuster.          By morning I am "Lydia, babysitter".  At the Huddlestons, I babysit a fascinating little 4-year-old man named Emmett.  Emmett know more about bugs than I ever want to know. In fact, if I have sons I hope my husband doesn't mind doing the bug collecting with Junior. Formerly, I had a suspicion that I have a minor bug "phobia". Now, I am convinced that this supposed "phobia" does in fact exist. It's kind of embarrassing, but I've decided that it is in fact minor because I do have the power to overcome it in crisis situations. Anyway, Emmett really is a little man. He employs extraodinarily correct grammer, 95% of the time, and also posseses a rather extenxive vocabulary. I know some college students who don't know as many words as this child knows.  I am greeted at the door by a bouncing child saying, oh so politely, "Hi Miss Lydia! How was your day?". Uh huh. If you want to hear some really funny stories, just ask, I could tell you some.         Moving on, by afternoon I am "Lydia, ticket salesperson".  I work in the Brooks Center box office.  For anyone who may not know, The Brooks Center is Clemson University's performing arts building, and no, there's not much going on this summer.  In fact, there are 3 shows on sale right now, the first of which is on July 23.  Mostly I just sit here, reading, playing minesweeper or another game of that sort, and hopping the phone will ring or someone will come in so I'll have something to do.  This job actually inspired me to begin "blogging".  I do have visitors. John, a friend of mine from choir and Tigeroar, is working in the choral office this summer. He stops by to see me, and sometimes Jodie pops in. I love visitors, it makes my whole day when someon comes to see me.      By night, I am "Lydia, mistress of movies".  Really, I just work at Blockbuster, and that's usually only 2 nights a week (though one hope's  continually for more hours). This job is actually really great for me.  I am saving so much money! You see, if yo uknow anything about me AT ALL, you know that i LOVE a good movie, and I will watch almost anything in hopes that it will indeed be a good movie. Case in point, last night I watched "Bad Santa". Funny, but I would only recommend it to boys. I would have to recommend it to girls on a girl-by-girl basis.  Not all girls find the same things funny that I find funny... Anyway, I get free rentals, so I'm saving money.  My most favoritist peron to work with is Greg. On Friday and Saturday nights, someone gets to be "active seller" at Blockbuster.  This person wears a red apron, and walks around talking to all the customers, informing them about programms like Rewards or movie and game passes.  If Greg is working, it's pretty much guaranteed that he'll be active seller (cause he's so smooth ;) ) Hence the link to his blog.        When I'm not working, which really does happen, I can be found in one of 3 places.  The Odd Fellows Home in Pendleton (though I have not been there in quite awhile), Katie's house (always, always a great place to be), or in my own apartment (usually either if Jodie and I are the only ones and therefore able to relax and enjoy ourselves, or when I'm actually sleeping). I have become very fond of "the spot", though I have not been often, I hope to go more. I have had my car repaired 4 times since school got out and will be having it repaired again very soon apparently. These have been the broad highlights of my life. I could go on and on (I'm rarely at a loss for words) but no one will read this, it's already far too long. So that's the short story of my life as me. :)

         So I visited my own blog today, and, lo and behold, I have readers! I have comments! My thoughts on this? "WOOHOO, I have readers!" followed immediately by, "Uh oh, I have readers". Those of you who have blogs yourself surely understand this. But, I've decided to stick with "woohoo, I have readers" and refer everyone back to my disclaimer in which I promise nothing. I have to say, I've been having alot of fun with this. I never realized how great it is to write things down. It really helps me think things through. Thanks to everyone who has commented, it's so much fun to read them and hear what you guys have to say.

         Ever stop to think about why things are funny? I do.  I'm constantly amazed by the things that make people laugh, the things that make me laugh.  "Why are you laughing?", someone asks. "Because it's just funny hahaha". you reply. Interesting.  Jesse once told me that it's all in the timing. People laugh when something unexpected happens or is said.  I think there's alot of truth in that...  Here's the thing. I'm not funny.  I don't tell jokes. I don't think funny thoughts, well, they're funny to me alot of times, but I wouldn't think they'd be funny to anyone else.  So, I meander through life, minding my own business, take the mental scenic route, and generally trying not to bother people.  Why, then, are they laughing? What is so funny? Tonight I amuse my cooworkers for at least thirty minutes with what I considered to be pretty typical behavior. They couldn't stop laughing.  All I did was peer over the counter at Kris with only my eyes showing.  It really wasn't meant to be funny, I was just bored.  Later I recited a line from The Godfather, also not really funny, but Jonathan was higly amused.  Ok, so I did a little Godfather impression.  Apparently impressions are funny.  If you can observe someone and then mimick what they do, how they sound, what they say, you can make someone laugh.  I'ts pretty much guaranteed, as long as that person has obserrved the same behavior.  Trust me on this one, I do impressions of a certain acquaintance of mine almost every day for Jodie. She finds them hysterical.  So, is comedy all in the timing? Can someone be funny even though they are completely convinced that they're not? Is it weird that I'm sitting on my bed at 2:30 in the morning pondering what is funny and why what is is funny is funny? Is it funny that I just used the word funny three times in the same sentence? I should sleep, this is getting ridiculous.

        This morning while I was sitting on my bed, watching Dawson's Creek, and just enjoying the peace of being the only one at home, Clark IMed me.  He sent me a link to a new article about a possible new reality tv show called "Gifted".  It's the Christian version of American Idol! Isn't that great? They want to "make the message more acceptable" I think it said they wanted to blend Christianity into Pop culture while still holding on to the fundamentals. Something like that. Well, isn't that just wonderful. Now we can compete on tv for most talented musician but do so in the name of Christ. Fabulous. I'm sure many will be compelled to cry out to Christ Jesus for salvation as a result. I'm sure the holiness of God, His mercy and grace will be crystal clear to the viewing audience.   Why? Why do Christians insist on blending in with the world to the point of disappearing entirely? Don't get me wrong, I don't think we should hide ourselves away from the world or make it a point to stick out in unreasonable ways (for instance being purposefully out of date and trying to look completely idiotic just so we can say "we're not of this world") I think that Christ fit in to a certain extent.  He followed cultural norms so far as they did not contradict the commands of God, so why shouldn't we follow cultural norms as well? This is not my point. My point is, Chritianity is not normal. Praise God. People are royal screw ups. We CAN'T do ANYTHING right. Fact. But what we have is Christ Jesus is different thatn anything this world has to offer. We have freedom from our own fatal flaws. We have eternal life - eternal referring not only to length but also to quality and that is a topic for another time. We are free. We are free! WE ARE FREE! Free to love, free to obey God rather than men, free to live our lives in the knowledge that no matter what we do and no matter how everyone we know feels about us, we are loved unconditionaly by the Creator of all things. A Creator who, in the words of Michael Card, "Cannot love more, and will not love less". With this freedom comes great responsibilty. How can we be saved, rescued without cause, from eternal damnation, and then be content to live our lives in a frantic search to blend in with everyone else? Why don't we want to tell people? Why are we so freaking scared of all the damned and dying people in this world? Why do we want to pretend that we are just like everyone else when it is clear that God's love has changed us forever and there is no going back?    I don't know about you, but I know why all these things are true of me. I have no faith. I don't really believe the Gospel. I don't, because if i did, if I REALLY believed, I would act on my freedom.    You see, this makes me worse than everyone else. I'm worse because I have SEEN GOd work. He has worked IN ME, and still my unbelief out weighs my faith. So I pray, with the father of the mute boy in Mark 9:24 "LORD, I believe; help my unbelief!"

       Today I ventured out into a vast new world into which I have never before even considered venturing.  This is the world of computer code.  However rudementary the code used on this site may be, it is nonetheless a foreign language to me.  But that did not stop me. No sir. Today I taught myself (with the help of FAQ and other useful tools) how to add links to my site (including a link to a better comment page than the one automatically supplied), how to add my little "quote of the day section", and how to change the text on my comment link.  This may (probably does) seem trivial to you, but I am so extremely proud of myself. :-D I just wanted to share my excitement with everyone.  Feel free to express your own undoubtably uncontainable pride in me and my monumental achievement. hehe

       Honestly, you may want to skip this one. I just wrote my thougts and feelings and then ended up preaching to myself at the end. Which is great, for me, because I've been faithfully reminded of God's Grace and His love for me, but it's not funny and it's not entertaining. I don't apologize, I just wanted you to know.   I think I understand why some people choose to be hermits.  After all, relationships are some of the hardest things in life.  Everything else builds on and around the foundational relationships you have formed.  If these relationships begin to disintegrate, or if someone you had formerly counted on is no longer around, all of life seems to instantaneously come crashing down around your ears.  It's almost as if all of nature senses your weakness and decides to take cruel advantage of it. If, however, you have cut yourself off, built barriers guarding your soul, made constant and consistent effort to ensure that you are alone; then you are not subject to this weakness.  If you depend on no one, your world cannot collapse simply because of the failure of someone else.  ( Of course, your going to fail all on your own too, but at least you know it was your fault and no one else's) So, to live in seclusion is to live in strength, dependant on none but oneself. That way, when your world comes crashing down around your ears, you probalby saw it coming because you are the one who made th fatal mistake. Things still come crashing down, it's just that you felt you had more control over it.  Ha. Yeah right. You could perhaps buy into that, if only the most common complaint among people today was not loneliness.  The human soul longs for companionship.  We are all looking for our best friend.  We desperately search, looking in every direction, peering down every alley, trying each venue we encounter, hoping each time that this will be the one.  This is the person in whom all my hopes and dreams will be fulfilled.  Here I have found someone who will make me happy. Forever. Woohoo!  I have to confess, that's what I'm looking for, even though I know that person does not exist. See, everyday I form an idol.  He's perfect. He thinks I'm funny, and smart, and he likes me just the way I am.  It doesn't matter what he looks like, what kind of car he drives, how much money he has, or how much he might make later.  All I ask of this idol is unconditional love.  Everday I look for him, I wish for him, I complain in my heart because I can't find him. It's a hopeless situation, it's sad and heart-breaking.  While this is truely depressing, the saddest part of all is that this dream of mine really does exist. He's standing right in front of me. Not an idol, a real living being. There really is someone who loves me unconditionally, he willingly gave up everything for me and he can and does provide for me everyday. He LOVES me. He loves ME. Just the way I am. Yet HE is not content to leave me as He found me, but daily pushes me and encourages me toward improvement. But I don't love Him. Because I am selfish and stubborn, my heart is hard and my eyes are blind. I push Him away because change is hard and quite honestly I'm attached to my faults. Everyday I think that He will leave. But everyday He waits, He reminds me of His love in every little happening, every moment of every day.  Someday, when I am perfect, I will love Him back. And how, when I daily reject the Great Love of my life, can I expect to find a reflection of that love here on earth?   " beloved listen to me don’t believe all that you see and don’t you ever let anyone tell you  that there’s anything that you need but me" --Derek Webb   " i am my beloveds and my beloved’s mine so you bring all your history and i’ll bring the bread and wine and we’ll have us a party where all the drinks are on me then as surely as the rising sun you will be set free"-- Derek Webb  That said, yeah, life might be easier as a hermit, but the true loneliness of our hearts eminates not from our need to be one with another person, but rather from our need to be one with our God.

       Hello, welcome to my blog. :) Never, in ten million years would I have thought that I would have a blog. Here I am, nonetheless, blogging. I now have in my possesion approximately 4 hours of "free-time" a day. During this "free-time" I am stuck, sitting at a computer, waiting for someone to call or walk up to my window so that I will have something to do. Concurrently, it seems that I am always at work and my friends and family know increasingly less about me.  While I am not entirely sure that they mind, I've decided to give them a chance to know, and at the same time, give myself something to do. So, this is it. I promise nothing. Read at your own risk.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, I called Katie and told her I was starving. She brought me food, AND soda. &nbsp; This morning, when my car wouldn't start. I called Clark. I'm pretty sure I woke him up, despite his denial. He picked me up and drove me to school. Also, when we were halfway there and I realized I had movies in my car (back at the apartment) that were due by noon, he turned around, went back to get them, and stopped by Blockbuster on the way to school. &nbsp; Katie is picking me up from school and dropping me off at Blockbuster. Jodie is picking me up from Blockbuster and taking me to get John's car, because John is a sweetheart and offered to let me use his car until Saturday cause he's not here. &nbsp; It's like my own little pictures of mercy, love, and grace, right here in my friends. I love you all, you're beyond wonderful. &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still taking name suggestions for my car. It really needs a name. Help me out here.

      &nbsp; Some of you may remember an evening in the spring when we (Katie, Deb, Andy, Ben, Sam, not sure who else) were eating dinner at Super Taco and I declared that I had emancipated myself. Well, I had, but I didn't do&nbsp;a very good job of it. See, it only lasted about 3 weeks and after that it fluctuated between different prisons... some of you know what i'm talking about, some of you don't, it's all good. :)  &nbsp; Anyway, I just wanted to let you all know that I was reminded this weekend that I don't have to emancipate myself, that I CAN'T emancipate myself. I was reminded the there is Someone who has already emancipated me. Someone who loves me, just the way I am. My dream. Sweet of Him not to beat me over the head with His love, but instead to patiently remind me over and over and over again.&nbsp; I won't get into my own morally reprehensible behavior towards Him...&nbsp; New favorite hymn, In Christ Alone, favorite verse of said hymn to follow...  &nbsp; No guilt in life, no fear in death &nbsp; This is the power of Christ in me. &nbsp; From life's first cry to final breath &nbsp; Jesus commands my destiny. &nbsp; No power of hell, no scheme of man &nbsp; Can ever pluck me from His hand. &nbsp; Til He returns, or calls me home &nbsp; Here in the&nbsp;power of Christ I'll stand.  See the girl with the broken smile? that's me. She will be loved.

      &nbsp; Good weekend. Friday night, rehearsal for BeCa's wedding, really good dinner, that was fun.&nbsp; Saturday, wedding in Greenville, wedding in Clemson. Oh, BeCa's wedding was so much fun. Has anyone ever seen Pastor Jimmy dance? I have, haha, Bill Fisk too, and Mr. Zane, and Katherine Howard's dad, oh, and BeCa's mom, that woman can DANCE.&nbsp; Anyway, that was quite a night.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; The funny thing is, as much fun as the wedding was, the real fun began after I left. Met up with Patrick, Ben, Clark, Sarah Nell, and Lauren at the Joint, proceeded to the Tiki Hut where we went swimming off the dock at 3:30 in the morning... details are funny, but I think I"ll keep them to myself, the ones I remember anyway...  &nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday I went home and had some family time then came back and hung out with Greg and Katie for awhile. We watched a rather moving Anime movie about WW2. Later KAtie and I headed to the Odd Fellows Home to watch Bubba Ho-tep. I've seen it twice now. If you haven't seen it, you really really should. random. funny.  &nbsp; 12 hours of sleep last night. marvelous. working or on call every night this week at Blockbuster.

      &nbsp; Yesterday. So much fun. Jodie and I went to sign our lease at The Summit. The guy that works there cracks me up. Anyway, we signed our lease, then went to look at the model apartment. Oooh, we're so excited!  &nbsp; Last night, we went to Anderson, to window shop and get decorating ideas. Now, normally I hate shopping, but there are a few people withwhom I have alot of fun shopping. Jodie is one of those people. I even bought clothes, used up my birthday money. My mom is going to be so happy, she begged me to buy some new clothes. You guys will probably be happy too. She hardly ever saw me and she was sick of my clothes. I can't imagine how the people who see me everyday feel. Of course, if you're like me, you probably don't even notice.  &nbsp; When we got home, we made popcorn and watched Anne of Green Gables. Ahh... great movie. Wonderful day.&nbsp; It's going to be a busy weekend. BeCa's wedding rehearsal tonight, 2 weddings tomorrow, my borther John is getting baptised Sunday morning. Busy&nbsp; but fun. Maybe I'll see some of you too! :)  &nbsp; I've come to the conclusion that Greg and Katie are the only people who read these.

      &nbsp; I will cook dinner for anyone who helps me move both out of University Village AND into the Summit. The moving out will probably take place next Friday and the moving in will happen one day after I get back from the beach. My theory is, the more people who help, the less work it is really. Plus, the more the merrier whenever you're having dinner, right? So who wants to help?

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, let me tell you, it's been too long since I acted on impulse, threw caution to the wind, and just took off on a random adventure. What has happened to me? Why did I ever stop doing that? Well, no worries, now that I have sampled random adventure once more, there will be no holding me back. &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to go somewhere, do something. So... &nbsp; Friday night&nbsp;I got off work at 9pm, packed up some clothes and drove to Columbia where I spent the night with my friend Ann-Marie and her husband Pete (who is also my cousin). Saturday Ann Marie and I headed to Charleston for the day. We went shopping and spent some of my birthday money, ate lunch, and headed to the beach. Later that night we drove back to Columbia, watched a movie and painted our toenails. Sunday morning I left at 8am and came back to Clemson. After church, Clark, Mark, Lisa, Kris, and I ate lunch at Cracker Barrel. Then I went home and did some packing (less than 2 weeks til moving day!) and then went back to church for music practice. Later Greg and I went to see Anchorman and then had dinner at Ruby Tuesdays. Best weekend I've had in a long time. So great, so relaxing... ah... &nbsp; &nbsp; OH, and this morning was absolutely fantastic as well.&nbsp;Got up&nbsp;at 7, worked out, saw my dad, went for a walk with Mel in the Botanical Carden, went swimming, went out to lunch. All before 12:30. That was great too. I think I like getting up at 7...  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, for anyone who moticed my absence and wondered about it in passing, that's where I've been and what I've been doing. Oh, and the next time you change your dinner plans (like you did on Saturday) please call Clark and let him know. The poor boy was at Monterey's all by himself.

      &nbsp;It was bound to happen sooner or later, let's be honest. The fact that it has happend at such a time when I am able to do something about it is extremely fortuitous. What has happened? you ask, you're curiousity peaked as you read on, perched on the edge of your chair, quivering with anticipation...  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Road trip fever. I've got it. The unexplainable, irrepresible desire/urge/need, to go somewhere you don't normally go, do something you don't normally do, with people that perhaps you don't always see. The timing, as it happens, coincides with my first whole entire Saturday off in AGES.&nbsp; So, refusing to sit around on this gift of a Saturday wondering what to do, I have made plans.&nbsp;I'm going to disappear. That's the plan. I plan to&nbsp;&nbsp;have inordinate amounts of fun, obscene amounts of fun. Jealous? I would be.  &nbsp; Check out my new quote, it's a Lydia original. I was talking to a friend today and it just came out.

        This is what I do at work. mostly. Sometimes, every once in awhile I have a customer, but mostly I entertain myself on the computer. Today I was browsing through the away messages of my friends on IM and came across some GREAT pictures. Ever been to Iceland? me neither, but Patrick has, and you should definitely check out his pictures. There's a link over there in the list of links -->.    Patrick, I hope you don't mind...

       Back to reality, back to the here and now... Ok, it's been a few days since my last post, so this one might be a bit longish. Sorry about that, but really, this is more for me than you, I need to rehash.    Good weekend, some family time, lotsa lovin from my niece and nephews... Sunday the real fun began. It was a great day, church in the morning, making sandwiches together, playing frisbee on Bowman, going swimming, music practice, nap, party. And what a party it was. Kudos to the boys for a party well thrown. I think a good time was had by all, even those who don't remember it well. Live n Learn. I know I had a good time.     Monday morning, it was good to wake up among friends. I must say, that's a nice way to start the day. We talked of shades of gray and bamboo soup. Off home for a shower, some food, Jodie time, and a nap. Later we were at Katie's to watch Poolhall Junkies. That's a must see. You really must see it, great movie. Pancakes at the boys house. Patrick rocks. MTV rocks greatest moments or some such show... not quite sure. Jam session ( i love those ) Suicide Kings, I missed the ending... fell asleep, I think that's excusable, it'd been a busy 2 days.    Tuesday was my birthday. and wow. if you guys don't love me, you are sure doing a great job of pretending. Jodie woke me up with a Happy Birthday shout, a smile, and i present. Another great way to wake up :) . Katie, Deb, and I had coffee and just hung out and talked. Deb bought me a bracelet of happiness. I think that was the first time Deb and I have ever been alone together. kind of funny when you think about it. Free cheesecake at Keith Street and more hilarious conversation with Jodie. She's so funny. You have no idea. All afternoon I was getting phone calls - Clark, Melanie (my sister-in-law), Mom, Rachel Harrison, Renee, Mel, Anne Marie (friend from Columbia), Will Sloop, John Callaway, it was great. Went to Katie's, great lasagna(thanks Katie), great presents ;)(thanks Clark and Lindsey), great cake (thanks Mel), fun dictionary time (thanks Patrick) Keith Street to play pool. Free birthday shot (thanks bartender guy) pitcher, pool, ride in Clark's car, so much fun. Really it was such a great day. Thank you all so much, you don't know how much that meant to me.  I missed ya Greg. :)    One more thing. I have two new friends. They're in, they're awesome, they're staying (we won't let them escape). Welcome in Patrick and Renee! You guys are awesome.

         I babysit a little boy nema Emmett. He's 4, I've mentioned him before. Emmett has an old stuffed kitty cat that he plays with constantly. He calls it Kitty. Now, when I'm there, I have to make Kitty talk, but he is always telling me what he wants her to say. Here's an exmaple of something I go through quite regularly.  Emmett: Miss Lydia, make Kitty ask if she can play with my truck. Kitty:  Can I play with your truck, Emmett? Emmett: NO. You can't. It's mine.  Emmett: Miss Lydia, make Kitty try to play with this ball. (Kitty tries to play with the ball and Emmett snatches it away) Emmett: NO. Kitty, you can't play with that. Miss Lydia, did I snatch it away just im time? Me:     Just in time for what? Emmett: Just in time so Kitty couldn't play with it.     It's getting to me. This kid is so negative, all the time. Every game he plays is contradictory or about making somebody cry. I'm just not sure how much more I can take.     On the opposite end of the spectrum, my nephews and niece are in Greenville, visiting from Indianna. Tonight I will go home to see them and have my Grandma's birthday party. When I open the door, Makayla (3) will gasp "It's Lydia!" and throw herself at me, squeezing with all her might. Trey will kiss me repeatedly and bombard me with stories and beg to play a game. Trevor will feign shyness and then break into an adorable dimpled grin and reach for me. They will love on me and compete for my attention until time for bed. I can't wait. I love my babies.

        Miss me? huh? didja? huh? hehe... so, it's been quite awhile hasn't it? This blog has the potential to be excrutiatingly long. I'll be curious to know if anyone actually makes it to the end. :)   Where have I been? you don't really want to know, but i'm going to tell anyway Thursday, July 29, 2004:    I spent all day thursday and friday packing up and cleaning out my apartment. Aren't you sorry you missed out on that? Friday night i hung out with Katie, Patrick, Sean, Lindsay Mann, and some of Katie's co-workers, as a result of my moral reprehensity (or perhaps my exhaustion that night) I don't remember their names. I do remember that they were very nice and lots of fun... perhaps Katie can tell me who they are... hung out with Renee and Patrick until very early in the morning, slept on Renee's couch. Went home.  Saturday. Went to the beach with my family. That was a lot of fun. I got to stay the whole time! I haven't been able to go on a complete family vacation in quite some time.  I always have to leave eraly for work or school. We stayed at the beach until the following Saturday. Now, beach vacations with my family are fascinating things.  Something always happens. This time, our beach chairs got stolen. Who steals beach chairs? anyway. We played alot of games. My brother John loves to play  Monopoly, so each year, we all resign ourselves to play one game of Monopoly. I, of course, set out to lose. Quick and painless. But NO. I won. Go figure, I tried to lose and ended up owning almost everything on the board by the end. Unbelieveable. No possible explanation. Anyway, it was alot of fun. We played some family putt-putt. So serious with a bunch of "real" golfers.  (I almost beat Philip)  When we left the beach on Saturday, we drove down to Gainesville, FL, to investigate the newly acquired abode of my brother Timothy and his wife, Melanie. They have bought a very nice house and done alot with it already. We only got to stay one night, but time with them is always fun.  Sunday we drove home and I headed to Clemson.  Monday morning we moved all my stuff into our new residence in apartment 357H  at the Summit. Spent all day unpacking, with the help of my cousin Elizabeth. James and John and Elizabeth are all beyond wonderful for coming from Greenville to help me move in. That about brings you up to date. Unfotunately I left out all the funny stories to save space. Maybe I'll throw them in some later blog.   wow. That was dreadfully long and most assuredly boring. Wake Up! It's over. hehe.
