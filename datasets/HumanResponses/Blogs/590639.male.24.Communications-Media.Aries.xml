      ** NEWSFLASH ** Old Bethpage - A 22 year old grad student decides that since the roads are covered in snow and the plows had not been around yet to make the streets safe for motorists, it was the perfect opportunity to take advantage of what fun driving conditions await. After a night hanging out with a friend at the local coffee shop Jared B"bleep"y decided it was time to put his 1997 Saturn SL2 to the test. The roads between Huntington and Old Bethpage for the most part had not been plowed since the snow began falling with the exception of a few main roads. On the way to the coffee shop taking a turn a little bit too fast Mr. B"Boing"y car went into a zig zagging skid cutting completely across the road approximately 4-5 times in each direction before regaining control of his car.    On his way back to Old Bethpage, roughly three hours later,  the roads had still not been plowed, sanded or salted. Again, feeling a little dare devilish he decided to test his cars traction ability as well as his driving skills. Back on the local roads near his home he decided it was time to do some simple maneuvers that could have proven fatal in the road's current conditions. Approaching an empty T-intersection Mr. B"honk"y cuts the wheel of his vehicle hard seeing how the car would handle the skid. Instead of the car going into a 360 like he had hoped,  it had slid at a 45 degree angle opposite the direction in which the wheel was turned. The vehicle hopped the curb narrowly missing a stop sign and went onto the sidewalk. Once on the sidewalk the driver was able to regain control of the vehicle and make his way back to safety. Thank you Sir Isaac Newton!  Upon returning to his house, realizing his skid marks had left an impression in the snow there was only one thing left for him to do. He picked up his digital camera, hopped on his mountain bike and rode back to the skid scene. Here are the photos in chronological order.  urlLink Images    When asking Mr. B"hoohaah"y what possessed him to do this his response was simply,  "Hey why not... it seemed like a good thing at the time. Besides most drivers don't actually know what their cars can handle and what they can handle as drivers. I think I have a good grasp on my level now. Next time I'll keep it in a vacant parking lot... and in my pants or something like that."  All righty then Mr. B.  For those of you reading this... We're not going to say what you should do, but if you'd like more information Mr. B"diddy"y can be reached at  urlLink brewisms@jarbro.com .

      Ok, So I was just sitting and eating leftovers from the  urlLink Cheesecake Factory  and a commercial for this thing came on TV. Ok, in theory its a great idea... but would be caught dead walking down the streets of New York with one of  urlLink these bad boys  from  urlLink Hygen-A-Seat.com ? If you order now you even get a   stylish   carrying bag for it. Screw the bag and be proud of your new purchase... did I mention it comes in 5 different colors. I know I am gonna buy all five of them just so it can match it to my outfit for the day. Here is a list of alternate uses...  1. Necklace for your girlfriend. 2. An extremely large headband 3. Nail it to your house horizontallyand you have a basketball hoop 4. Nail it to your wall and you have a dart board. 5. Throw it at your friends head like horse shoes. 6. Buy one for our lovely president George Bush in Red hoping he will fall through the hole and drown... 7. Keep one in your car in case you get pulled over... try convincing the cop its one of the rings from URANUS and it controls your mind and your car. Quickly throw it over his head and drive away laughing. 8. Sell it on eBay to some idiot saying that its a new contraceptive device.  9. A porn star stretching machine. 10. Hang them from trees and throw footballs through them so you can be more like Chad Pennington from the NY Jets. (god damn JETS)
