      life for me is like a carousel. i've been goin around and around... learning more about life and what it has to offer. and all the people standing around watching me are the people that mean so much to me.  sometimes i see my mom, i always lookout for her. all i want to do is wave and yell out, "look mummy, no hands!"  sometimes i see my friends and i'd wish they were on this same ride with me.  sometimes i see old boyfriends and wished they would rot in hell... nah! just joking...  well, sometimes these people stick around to watch you on your cute little horsey. some walk away and never come back. but some walk away and then come back later on cos they miss you and there are those that never leave.  i thank God for all these people. for all they've taught me and i also want to thank him for the people that he's brought back into my life.   welcome back nicky! it's so good to hear from you again. nothing made me smile more today...  ***  i woke up at 12 this afternoon and spent the rest of the day baking corn muffins and watchin' 'bringing down the house'. funny flick with queen latifah and steve martin.  feelin so restless... i know i should be studying but i just can't. my man's heading down to his mate's place to watch soccer tonight so i guess it's just me, myself and those corn muffins! hehe... no worries nicole, i'll keep some for you sweetie! my sweet baby boy has already eaten like 12 muffins!! heh.... joking joking....  don't you go rollin em' eyeballs hon!    *****1-2-3-4-5 kisses for my baby boy

      i just did the craziest thing today. i went to sheila baxter hair school just to find out more about their hairdressing courses and guess what?  i ended up signing up for the course which begins on the 29th of May!!! i'm so excited and i really went by gut feeling this time... i still don't know if it was the right choice but i know i'm gonna do my best whatever the case is.  apparently, i can do both my degree and this hairdressing course at the same time!  my baby's so supportive of this whole thing and so is nicole! i'm so thankful to be blessed with such wonderful people. even my cousin, kelvin told me to do whatever makes me happy. and i reckon that this course would make me happy. i've never been very good with my hands but this time, i'll try my best. i know i'm pretty much a people person and getting along with people will be a breeze but as always, it's good to be prepared for weirdos...  *sigh*  i almost forgot what a freak magnet i am...   haha...btw, my baby's goth name is necrotic freak and mine's velvet kisses! kinky eh?  anyways, we're going out tonight! party party party...with a couple of lychee martinis and cooper's? life's too short to frown over textbooks! nicole darling... lighten up k? i'll bake you some corny muffins right now!  *** 1,2,3 kissies for my baby

      i've been in melbourne for almost a year now come this june. now, i'm not gonna lie and say it's been a blast because it hasn't really been all that  fantabulous  and  awesome .   instead it's been tranquil... until i met this rebel with no cause whatsoever. can i say he's a rebel? well, maybe not. he's a sweetheart with an occasional mean streak. pretty much like me AND  72.36  million other people scattered all over the universe!  his name will be kept confidential to protect his privacy and his life. tsk, don't know how many people this dude has offended. they might use information contained within these pages against him!  we met thru a friend and we've been inseperable ever since. except for the occasional hissy fits that he has...  *sigh*  just joking... he's sucha  man ! men don't have hissy fits... only women do! right honey? *tone of voice brimming with sarcasm*  ah well, i simply adore this barbarian. his savegery delights me everyday and his uncouth disposition drives me wild!   this haiku is for you babe...  "kohnan is my man (5)  he loves me like no one can (7)  i think he's real hot!(5)"  i love the quiet surprises that life has given me. i don't need fancy schmancy surprises to take the wind out of my sails cos i am the only one who needs to know how happy i am.

      i can't recall being this happy on any of my birthdays... this was my first birthday away from home...  my baby and i hung out a bit at my place the night before my birthday. we wanted to head down to crown to gamble and have $2 fish and chips! our attempts to take a nap before heading down to crown were in vain. we were obviously too excited and instead of catching some shut eye, we chatted incessantly about blackjack and roulette!   tim tam, my housemate was sucha sweetie, he gave me a hug an a hat! yup! a hat for my birthday... it's sucha cool hat! very JT or britney! i think i'll wear it to dave's (my better half's bro) 21st!  finally at 2 almost 3am, we made our way to crown! yipee! at that time i was already feeling kinda sleepy but i just went ahead anyway! we played a few games and had fish and chips and headed on home at 5 in the morning... when i could hardly open my eyes!  the moment my head hit the pillow, i was out cold until that silly sausage woke up and left at 9 in the morning... (i know...you must be asking what the...?) he had to go home and get stuff and stuff! *laughs*  the next thing i knew, my phone rang and it was my favourite person in the world!! he was annoyed that i didn't hear him knocking at the door... like hello! the door's downstairs and you're talking to someone who was sleeping like she hadn't slept in a 20 years!  groggily, i tumbled downstairs to open the door and there he stood with a huge bunch of all sorts of yellow flowers wrapped in pink and green paper! what more could a girl ask for? *smiles* what a sweetheart... he also made me a gorgeous pair of earrings... in yellow and black! *dreamy sigh* oh he also booked me in for a massage in the city with his mom who's birthday falls on the SAME DAY as me!  we headed to dragon boat to have yum cha with kelvin, nic and tim tam... it was pretty yum! oh! kelvin gave me this super stylish esprit bag... he did he know? i've been looking for a nice black leather bag since i got back to melb! and nic gave me this beautiful pearl bracelet... it looks so pricey! tsk! nic ah... you ah... really know how to choose gifts!  after yum cha, my baby dropped me off at the massage place. a much needed massage right hon? after you stress me out day after day? *laughs* just pulling your leg babe... i love you and NO you don't stress me out... much! the massage took an hour and right after that, we had to have an early dinner with his family! can you imagine? yum cha ended at 3.45 and dinner was at 5.30! i felt like a suckling piglet being prepared for the roast!  after dinner, we picked up fab an esther from chinatown and headed back to my place for drinks and some foosball! *laughs* then it was off to STRIKE! We bowled 1 game and played pool most of the time... that place had a lack of balls! i mean bowling balls and not testicular fortitude! *grins* yeah yeah... dave and his friends (dougie and john travolta/wop sing) came down to join us. dave's sucha riot... he's sucha ladies man! seriously!   and nope, my night doesn't end there... after bowling, we headed to hungry jack's for some sustenance! so yum... oh, esther made me a pair of earrings too! that girl is so sweet! you could just put her on a stick and call her lolly!  aside from the fact that my mom's not here, the could possibly be the best birthday ever! yeah yeah... my 21st was at some fancy schmancy place but i really don't know why this simple birthday just really made me incredibly happy. i really don't need expensive gifts to make me happy... just the company of good people and the person i love.

      here i am... blogging... on a saturday night! what the!?  i had a pretty okay afternoon but i did no studying whatever after yesterday's microecons paper. it was a paper from  hell  which the  devil  wrote himself! well it wasn't too bad considering the fact that i probably did pretty okay... the bozo next to me was frantically trying to copy my graphs and shit like that. i felt like punching him in the nuts but i had to finish my paper first! can't waste time on losers like him...  i went out for dinner with my boyfriend and his family. his dad's in town and this was the first time i met him. now i know why my boyfriend's got such nice eyes. i could stare into them for hours on end... *corny* eeeyer! stop this mushy shit before i hurl! well yeah, we had dinner and then  he  being sucha  gentleman  let me walk home alone while he went to meet his brother at a pub. but before we parted, he called me a f**king idiot... *chortle* can't you tell he loves me? *sweet sweet smile*  while i walked home alone, with him not giving two hoots about me, this buch of guys behind me were soooooo annoying and they started talking really loudly and getting rowdy. see, a real gentleman would have though of his girlfriend's safety and offered to walk her home (i live like 5 mins away) but no... my boyfriend seems to be lacking in that department. i know it seems silly on my part to go on and on and on about this lack of chivalry but isn't that what most girls want? even when we say "no, it's okay..." we don't really mean it. we just don't want to impose...  there was this one incident which happened on my last trip back home. it was so pleasant that i can still remember the finest details of what happened: It was a humid night and i was walking towards the bus-stop near wheelock place (borders) to wait for my bus no.65 to get home. i bought some magazines and wrapping paper from borders and at the same time, i brought stuff home from my shop (bikinis, tank tops... heh... it's good having your own shop eh?) to wear in melbourne. i had my hands full when someone tapped me on the shoulder and being so late and kinda dark where i was walking, i freaked out! i almost poked this guy's eye out with my wrapping paper. luckily he was wearing glasses! after gathering shocked pieces of myself and putting them backed together, i was delighted at what stood before me. a mighty fine looking  nerd ...  ooh yeah...  i love nerds! he looked like the architect sort with his black rimmed glasses... for like 8 seconds i simply saw his mouth move but no words came out! then when my hearing came back, i heard he magic words... "...you with that?"  HAR??? What the...  I didn't get the first part but it was actually "can I help you with that?"  Embarassed, I polietly declined his offer... and was about to walk on when he said the  3 uber-magic words  (NOT I LOVE YOU!! Silly...) it was,  "No, I insist...  just to the bus stop if that's where you're going..." i almost died on the spot! what's a girl to do when such an irresistable offer comes along?   ah well... if only every guy was like that! no in fact... if only my boyfriend was like that! he's that kinda guy who will never say "no, i insist..." but life's like that... you just have to suck it up!  i'm going out now to frostbites to meet jimmy, haven't seen him in ages. my boyfriend's gonna play pool so i guess we won't be meeting tonight... then again, he's staying over. well, if i'm lucky, he might not call me a f**king idiot again before we retire for the night...   0 kissies for my baby... not tonight hon, i've got a FUCKING HEADACHE brought on by hmmmm I don't know what!

      it all begins tomorrow.  my first paper.  i've finally gotten around to figuring out what bank reconciliation is all about. it's not that tough but when they say bank reconciliation, it makes me wanna chuck. can't they just call it "making sure that stuff balances out"? then again, that'd be too long...  i didn't see my baby since last sunday when he left at 6 or 7:30 in the morning. i missed him quite a fair bit i must say but it's all good training for when i become a rich and successful jet-setter! i might not even have to leave him behind cos my private jet would be more than able to accomodate the two of us and 5 maybe 6 friends? nicole, you coming right? heh...  guess what my thoughtful beast got me for our third month aniversary? a bolster... yep! a bolster in MELBOURNE!!!! i was so excited, i tested it out immediately!  i got him a Foosball Table (Soccer Table) like da one in FRIENDS. BUT it's not as exciting as MY BOLSTER!!! it's covered with a million teddy bears! *hyperventilate* i love my bolster... but not as much as my boyfriend *grin* (sorry Bobo {my bolster's name} i still love you more but don't tell him when he lies next to you tonight ok?)  anyways, back to reconciling with my notes and books... *groans*

      Unmotivated, uninterested, apathetic, unconcerned, disinterested… how else could I possibly describe myself right now?   My exams are days away and here I am getting all excited over my third month pressie for my baby! I just don’t believe myself! What happened to my old self? I honestly think that she just got up one day and went for a really long walk and never quite came back…  My books are untouched and nothing seems to matter... I've been feeling so lethargic and I simply can't wait for the holidays. Do I even deserve to have holidays? I haven't even worked hard enough to earn days off. This really isn't me...   LOST : Hardworking, nerdy chick who responds to the name Junie. She'd rather stay at home than party all night. She's only lazy when it comes to getting all dressed up and partying night after night. Other than that, she'll keep her house relly clean and bug her boyfriend to do the same. She was last seen walking languidly around Chapel Street. Please inform me if you do see her... I'm desperate! I'll even offer a reward for this chick!!  ** 1-2 kissies for my man

      Today was a SUPER GOOD DAY!!! *grins* Cos I saw   5 red cars   in a row! Nah, just joking... I didn't see&nbsp;  &nbsp;5 red cars    in a row, I just got a bit caught up in that book I'm reading called 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time'. You'll know this one Wayne!    Anyways, Andrew took me  OUT TO THE BALLGAME TODAY ! I was so excited... We went to the MCG to watch the    MIGHTY     MIGHTY   HAWKS    play against the little  ittybittytitty Kangaroos !! No prizes for guessing who we were rooting for.  *grin*  Despite the drizzle, we were wayyy too excited and nothing... and I mean nothing could dampen our spirits! Except our team losing... and sadly,  H  a  w  t  h  o  r  n  did dampen our spirits today.&nbsp;     SEE:    urlLink  http://afl.com.au/default.asp?pg=news&spg=display&amp;articleid=162097    The bloody Kangaroos won 143 to 63... What a disgrace! But what the heck! I had fun and so did my baby... My first ever footy game. I'll never forget today...   I'm so tired right now... I'm gonna take a shower, curl up on the couch with my baby and watch a good movie! Remember the Titans is on tonight! Another footy-themed inspirational movie... *sigh*  ***** 5 kissies for my fav footy team!  * x 1 million . A million kissies for my favourite footy fan! Thank you once again for bringing me to the game!

      it's a thursday morning and my most adorable boyfriend's just left for work. so... being my day off, I've decided to blog and write some of my cutesy-wutsey friends some testimonials cos they were friggin nice to me when I was back in SG... Esp my favourite Civic driver GARY!! And the ever puny lil' lan jiao face ex-boyfriend Vinny... *laughs* Bed of Cyn.... Muahahahhahahaha! And Char.... *smoochies and lovies* to ya babe! I would have never made my way back to Melbourne if not for you... Oh yah... and Spencer!! Heh... the driver! Damn it! How could I forget the driver? Then again... with you beside me Char, I tend to lose all track of time and ... people! And Tristan... my favourite psycho! I am thinking of hooking you up with a really good friend of mine. Remember Annie? Yeah... that hottie... Don't you remember? From the Wilkes family in New England! This'll help you jog your memory!!    urlLink http://1701a.com/title_detail.jsp?title=Misery      Then while I was on FRIENDSTER... yeah yeah... Damn loser right? Fine fine... I'll grow out of it eventually! But anyway...&nbsp;Andrew's lovely ex-girlfriend Hannah wrote him a testimonial about changing his picture cos the one he had on was taken by her ages ago. I looked at the pic and realised that it didn't even look like him anymore. Hmmm... Hon, I could sue you for misrepresentation... But upon further deliberation, I think you look a lot better now so I think we'll just leave that pic up there, we don't want too many hotties messaging you now... do we? Just to make my point, I'm gonna show you a BEFORE AND AFTER PIC ok? No photoshopping, no additives and no airbrushing... just Absolute Andrew. *GASP* Just when I was about to put up that old pic of Andrew, Friendster kindly told me that:

      16th July 2004  &nbsp;  Tim's farewell dinner at Ling Nam's was amazing!!! The food, the company... and the food! Oh the FOOD! Lobster in XO sauce... Enough! I'm supposed to talk about Tim here. He's was a good housemate. Cos' he slept most of the time and other than waking up to pee and eat... he really didn't do much. He was pretty quiet too. I think mostly cos' he slept the day away! *grins*  &nbsp;  The house feels kinda weird now knowing that he's not around SLEEPING. See, even when he's sleeping, he's got that kinda presence! And the only time he ever made noise was when Andrew talked too loudly and it woke him up. He'd wake up and give Andrew a dirty look and then go back to sleep! *laughs* Miss you heaps Tim Tam! *huggies*

      New house mate moved in today!  This adorable Singaporean girl called Kimberly. I know... We Singaporean girls aren't really that adorable but this girl is lah! She's funny and easy to get along with... I forsee many many parties and drinking sessions! *rolls eyeballs* Die lah... Too much fun and soon enough I'll forget my own name!  I had a good weekend.    THURS:  Clubbed @ Chicane...with Kimberly, Kelvin (my cuz), Linh from school and his frien Ben but without Andrew! Yah...can you imagine that? but I was a very very very good girl okay! I drank a bit too much tho and I was too pissed to do anything but crash on my bed when I got home.     FRI:  Clubbed again... at the Loft this time... Nice place with heaps of hotties! Too bad Andrew came along this time. But hey, I'm not looking to pick up so it didn't really matter. In fact, i'm glad he was there. *smoochies for Mr Rugby playa* haha... *makes a 'V' sign with my hands*     SAT:  went shopping for groceries at Prahran Market and baby and I made this YUMMY lamb and eggplant curry! We hung out all day at home and then finally in the evening we headed down to Borders to have a read and some coffee. GUESS WHO WE SAW?!!?!? We saw Shane Crawford... Who?? Did I hear you saw who!? He's the captain of my fav footy team, Hawthorn! Man he's a serious hottie... *laughs*     I'm so tired now... I had such a tiring day at class! First I did a set and then I was asked to be a model for a beauty class. They made me lie there naked and then they exfoliated my body, and then they did a seaweed wrap and finally I was given an oil massage... How tiring is that man? *evil chuckle* Okay okay... I'm a byotch! I had a friggin good day!  And now... I shall bid good night to all you sweeties!  ***** 1-2-3-4-5 kissies for my CB Rugby Playa
