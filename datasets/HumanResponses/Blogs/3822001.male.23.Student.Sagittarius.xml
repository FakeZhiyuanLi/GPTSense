      This is about a short autobiography of one of my favourite wrestler TRIPLE HHH. This guy is amazing to achieve so many things during his stay in WWE. Still considered to be one of best in the wrestling industry. Living up to his name TRIPLE HHH (better known as THE GAME , CEREBRAL ASSASSIN). Started as HUNTER HEARST HELMSELY to now the leader of the famous faction EVOULTION.  This are facts about THE GAME  TRIPLE H Real Name: Paul Michael LeVesque Height: 6 foot 4 Weight: 260 pounds From: Greenwich, Connecticut Home Town: Nasuha  New Hampshire Finishing Move: Pedigree TRADEMARK MANEUVER: Knee-to-face PRO WRESTLER SINCE: 1992 Career Highlights: WWE Champion; World Heavyweight Champion; Intercontinental Champion; WWE Tag Team Champion; European Champion; King of the Ring 1997  Triple H calls himself "The Game," and you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who disagrees with that assumption.  Since making his WWE debut in the spring of 1995 (as Hunter Hearst Helmsley), Triple H has done it all in the sports-entertainment industry. He's the only man in the history of the business to have been a Grand Slam Champion and to have won both a King of the Ring and a Royal Rumble.  Triple H's dedication to the business was never more evident than on the May 21, 2001, episode of RAW. On that night, The Game teamed with Stone Cold Steve Austin to take on Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho in a Tag Team Championship match. During the bout, Triple H tore his left quadriceps muscle completely off the bone. Yet The Game found the heart to finish the bout, never once even thinking about giving up.  After eight months of hellacious rehab, The Game returned to a hero's welcome on the Jan. 7, 2002, episode of RAW. The fans of WWE sympathized with Triple H, thus making him one of the top fan favorites of that time.  Soon thereafter, The Game's true colors came shining through and he has once again found himself listening to the fans' jeers. To further solidify the fact that he doesn't care about the fans, Triple H has aligned himself with "the dirtiest player in the game," Ric Flair, Randy Orton and Batista. Together, they call themselves Evolution.  HHH was trained by the legendary Killer Kowalski in the early 1990's and debuted for World Championship Wrestling in 1994. One year later he left the company and joined the World Wrestling Federation, where he became known as Hunter Hearst Helmsley. The gimmick was that Helmsley was a snobby blueblood from Greenwich, CT. HHH showed great potential from the start, and he also got involved with politics very quickly. HHH became close friends with Shawn Michaels, Sean Waltman, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash. When Hall, Nash, and Waltman left the WWE, Helmsley was the only one punished since Michaels was the WWE World Champion. However, it would only be a few months until HHH became the WWE IC Champion.  In 1997, HHH brought in a female bodyguard named Chyna. After ditching the blueblood gimmick, HHH and Chyna would align themselves with Shawn Michaels to form DeGeneration X, once of the most dominant stables in wrestling history. The group will vulgar and controversial, but helped turn HHH's career around. When HBK retired from wrestling in 1998, HHH and Chyna formed a new DX with Sean Waltman (X-Pac) and the New Age Outlaws.  In 1999, HHH split from DX in order to focus on his singles career. Once he became WWE World Champion, the DX stable was brought back together. In November of 1999, HHH "married" Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of WWF owner Vince McMahon. The McMahon/Helmsley faction dominated the WWE during most of 2000.  In January 2002, HHH returned to the WWE and would win both the Royal Rumble and the WWE World Title shortly after returning. In September 2002, HHH was crowned the WWE RAW champion by Eric Bischoff.  A Great history of THE GAME. Your time taken to read this is article makes me feel happy.
