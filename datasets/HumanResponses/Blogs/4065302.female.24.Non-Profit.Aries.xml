      God, he doesn't even want me to touch him anymore! It's so discouraging. So I spend my time on here, chatting, writing, surfing, doing whatever to keep myself occupied and distracted. The worst part about it is that my "friends" and family can't wait for our relationship to end. Every time I talk to them I can sense it in their voice when they ask me how things are between us. They've been wanting our relationship to fail from the very beginning. That's just great. I don't want it to end. I just want us to communicate. Why do we always have to fight? Things just aren't so wonderful. It's depressing. I wonder if he even loves me anymore?

        This blog is here mainly for my purpose only, and I'm giving you permission to read it. If you don't like what I write here than by all mean DON'T READ IT. It's that simple. I am not holding a gun to your head or forcing you in any way to read what I have to say. So if you have any problems with it than please don't bother me with your whining. I may post my opinion, which I fully intend to do and I would require you to respect that. I may post things that bore you or don't interest you, but do I really need to tell you that maybe this isn't something that you should be reading then?   
  Just like anything else, you have the power to decide what you listen to, what you read, and what you do. If you don't like what's on TV, turn it off. If you don't like what's on the radio change the channel. You have many options. That's the awesome thing about our country! I have the freedom to say whatever I want, and you have to the freedom not to listen. Have a great day.

        urlLink http://volunteer.johnkerry.com/mysite/?ref=380232   Here's that more on Kerry that I mentioned:   Welcome to my Kerry page! I'm glad you are here. I am supporting Kerry because of everything Bush has done wrong! I don't want to imagine Bush getting another term being in control of our country. He has used us and treated us unfairly and unjustly. He has used our military for his own personal agenda, not for the good of our country or anybody else’s country. He is greedy, and money hungry. And he is most certainly NOT a Christian by any degree. I highly recommend seeing "Fahrenheit 9/11". It exposes the evil things that Bush has been associated with since his father was president. Who knows what else he has conspired. Unfortunately I have somehow positioned myself to be surrounded by conservative Christian republicans. I have been firmly informed by those I used to call my friends that there will be no support for Kerry from any of them. They are blind and close-minded, and that I cannot support either. They have decided to belong to the Bush cult. So, I will essentially be starting from scratch. I am still a Christian, but I do not have to be a republican to believe in God or Jesus. I believe in loving ALL people regardless of who they love. I believe in the God given right to freedom, the freedom to think for yourself, to make your own decisions, and to say whatever you feel like saying. I believe in the Constitution that this country was founded on. I believed in what this country stood for before Bush took over. I want to believe in it again! I believe it is wrong to legally force your own beliefs onto other people. It is dangerous to try to create a society of people who think, act, behave, and talk like everyone else. We are diverse. We are all different, and we are all imperfect. And that is what makes us great. So, if you can join me in supporting Kerry, not only will Kerry be grateful, but so will I. I need to find a new group of friends who are open minded and kind. I hope you have a wonderful, fulfilling day in whatever you may be doing!

       I just want to feel wanted, for who I am, forever, because I don't think I ever have. 

She Is His Only Need

Lyrics by: Dave Loggins

Billy was a small town loner
Who never did dream
Of ever leaving southern Arizona
Or ever hearing wedding bells ring
He never had a lot of luck with the ladies
But he sure had a lot of good working skills
Never cared about climbing any ladder
He knew the way in a small cafe, found the will
He met Miss Bonnie
And a little bit of her was a little too much
A few movies and a few months latter
The feeling got strong enough
They didn’t own a car
So it must have been love
That drove him uptown for a diamond
That’s when he started goin’

(Chorus)
Over the line
Working overtime
To give her things just to hear her say she don’t deserve them
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted
‘Cause without her where would he be?
See, it’s not for him
She is his only need

Ring on her finger and one on the ladder
A new promotion every now and then
Bonnie worked until she couldn’t tie her apron
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children
And my, how the time did fly
The babies grew up and moved away
Left 'em sitting on the front porch rocking
And Billy watching Bonnie’s hair turn gray
And ev’ry once in a while you could see him get up
And he’d head downtown
‘Cause he heard about something she wanted
And it just had to be found
Didn’t matter how simple or how much
It was love
And, boy, ain’t that love just something
When it’s strong enough to keep a man goin’

(Repeat Chorus)

Over the line
Working overtime
She is his only need
His only need
Overboard
Over the limit
Just for her
She is his only need
His only need

      What is happening to me? This isn't who I am! I am practically cheating on Aaron (whom I still love-I SWEAR I DO) but yet I don't feel the least bit guilty! What is wrong with me? Have I lost every ounce of morals I ever had? I want to make things better between us, but this certainly isn't helping. I am so confused. I am not the kind of person that purposely tries to hurt anyone I love. I just rely on the wrong kind of people. I'm in a relationship; I should be going to him and talking to him about what's happening.
I mean, take last night. I am talking to another guy all night and Aaron walks in. How do I explain who I was talking to; so late; why? Why are there wet t-shirts in the shower? Why am I acting so weird, so abnormal? I am such a bad liar! I can't be convincing, especially when I'm put on the spot like that. I DON'T WANT TO LIE, what am I talking about? I don't want to be in this situation at all. I know it'll catch up to me eventually.

      We're fighting again so my day has started lousy. I didn't plan on this blogger to be all about my fucked up relationship. Why am I still with him? Oh, 'cause I have nowhere else to go. The whole thing is just completely ridiculous. I think I'm starting to hate him. Can you believe that? I'll just keep living here until something better comes up. Who cares what I think anyway? He doesn't.

      Well it's after two o'clock on Sunday morning and I'm waiting for my mom to come and take me to the hospital. What is happening to me? I am retaining fluid in my feet again. I don't understand this. I've gained way too much weight in the last couple of days for this to not be a problem. I can't afford this. I don't have health insurance anymore (thank you Oregon!). I need to go to work tomorrow. This just doesn't make any sense. I guess I'll find out soon enough what is causing this problem. All I know is that it isn't good. Gawd, and Aaron is being a total asshole about it! It's like I have to argue about EVERYTHING with him. I asked him if he'd take me to the hospital tomorrow but I guess he's just too darned busy, doing god knows what. I mean he doesn't even have to stay there. Just drop me off.
I should go now.
