						   Okay, I received a telephone call from a friend today concerning this VERY controversial issue.  Now, I'm not going to say what my moral beliefs are on this, other than "I don't know."  I don't know if it's wrong in the eyes of God.  I believe that it's simply better for me not to have an opinion and find out when I get to heaven.    Now with that said, I have to speak politically.  The problem that I have with right-wingers against gay marriage or even gay unions is that they are not setting aside their moral beliefs from constitutional guarantees.    We all have to live in this place together.  The world has gotten much smaller over the years with the dawning of technology and so it's increasingly more important that we tolerate one another.  With that said, I have to think that a homosexual is a citizen just the same as I am. He has the same rights and privelages that I do.  A person should not be denied the same benefits that I am simply based upon their preference for whom they choose to spend the rest of their lives.  It is unbelieveable to me that people are unable to separate this from their moral opinions.    Now, this really isn't even supposed to be a federal issue.  It is rather supposed to be left to the states.  To fix that, some people seem to think that we need to make it a constitutional amendment.  That is in my opinion, a total misuse of the constitution and its original intent.  Let's go ahead and make a constitutional amendment making jaywalking illegal while we're at it.    So this clears up my opinion on the issue.  It's a pretty nutshell post and I'd be happy to discuss it further with anyone that would like to.

						   I love to look at data over long periods of time.  It gives me a wonderful sense of what is actually happening.  For instance, take a look at this website: http://www.pollingreport.com/BushJob.htm    It asks the very simple question "Do you approve or disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling his job as President?"  You'll note that the most recent study conducted between July 8-11th states that 48% of Americans disapprove.  I've seen polls that said a few points lower in fact.  But the clear point is that NOW, the majority of Americans are unhappy with the way he is doing his job.    Those that are for Bush don't really seem to be all that vocal either.  They are still behind the guy, but are not as stongly voiced as they once were.  Either way...take a look at pollingreport.com where I got this information.  There's plenty of other good statistics.    More to come later on John Kerry's wife.  It's not really great news, but considering that I know absolutely nothing about her at all, it's intriguing to know something.

						   I used to think that polling just "ruined the surprise."  This was when I was very young and didn't know much.  I now know that polling is absolutely necessary along the way to see who's winning. It's very much a political scoreboard.    The American Research Group is my favorite site for polling information.  I've been following it since early in the primaries.  The following site www.americanresearchgroup.com/presballot/ will take you to the most recent ARG poll.    This information shows that that with Nader in the race, Kerry has 47%, Bush has 44% and Nader has 3% of the vote.  Okay, so this is a statistical tie.  Without Nader in the race, it's a point more for Kerry, but still statistically tied.    I don't get Ralph Nader!  The man is apparantly out to get the Democratic Party.  The statement that he is trying to get his message out doesn't hold water anymore!  He's run two times prior to this.  He knows that he isn't going to win and doesn't have a prayer of finishing with a respectable second.  It just makes me mad.

       Okay I love golf.  I mean I think there's no sport any better.  If you're thinking "but Fulkie, you just chastised athletics in an entry yesterday" you make a good point.  I still feel that athletics should come COMPLETELY secondary in our school systems, but if there is one sport that you truly gain something other than athletic ability, it's golf!    Golf is a sport where even if you aren't any good, you can still really enjoy it.  There is a specific etiquette to the game and the professionals are truly gentlemen and ladies.  (There is of course always an exception.)  It is a quiet game where you can gain a great deal of insight to things going on in your life.  Golf requires a great deal of strategy and planning and nothing feels better than a well hit shot.    Sadly however I am still what you may call a "duffer."  I'm not that great at the game.  If I break a 100 on 18 holes I'm doing a victory dance like it's nobody's business!  I love playing though.  It's such a wonderful game because it's very noble.  I will always love the game and play it regardless of how good I am.

       Okay, you may be thinking....6 posts in one day is a bit pathetic.  I have a few reasons for this:   1.  I feel compelled to provide some initial content for all to view.    2.  This has been the least productive day of my life.  I believe the day I was born was more productive and I can imagine that the day I die will also be more productive.  I came in because Tracy went to get certified as a Pathwise mentor.  I came in this morning around 8:30.  At around 9:30 a student strolls in for a tuba lesson (I WAS expecting him.) Another student comes in later for a lesson on percussion.  (I was also expecting her.) At around 11:30 I was finished and just sitting around.  I inventory all of our percussion equipment (that took me around 20 minutes) and then went back to sitting on my butt since everything else is just about finished up for the summer.  I do a little bit of work on the newsletter (everything I can without consulting Tracy) and am now waiting on 5:30 to get here so I can go eat Chinese and then go to choir practice.    We were SUPPOSED to have drumline at 3:00 but after Rallo drove an hour to get to Piggott it turns out that several of our kids FORGOT about it and therefore I had to cancel. (We will chastise them royally next Monday when we see them again.) Talk about making me feel embarrased.  "Sorry Rallo...our kids only have half a brain and therefore forgot about this obligation!"    ::sigh:: So now I sit on my butt watching the minutes pass.  I feel guilty for being this bored.  I shouldn't be bored, I'm generally much too busy for it.    But hey, at least it explains all the posts today.

        urlLink    "The Incredible Fulk"&nbsp; urlLink     Okay, so in my quest for good blogging, I've stumbled upon a very easy way to add pictures to the blog.  It is the "hello" program offered through blogspot.  This thing is awesome!  It's a very fast way to get pictures on the blog, or for that matter, send them to anyone else.  While this is of course not my finest photograph, it shows me in an everyday atmosphere.  ::sigh:: Sadly, I cannot hide the truth.  "Hello, my name is Jon Fulkerson and I am an unstylish wannabe prep."  There....I said it.

       Okay, I have taken away the incriminating evidence regarding my feelings toward athletic programs in schools.  It was on some good advice from my legal counsel (aka: my father) that this may not be the kind of frank commentary that I want posted for the entire world to see.    But let me make myself perfectly clear.  I am an avid supporter of producing well-rounded kids.  I think kids should try their hands at a great deal of different things.  If that includes athletics then I am all for it.  I just wish that our school systems would remember what we are supposed to be teaching the kids and why.    Thanks Dad.

       I have got some very gifted students.  Band tends to attract the more gifted individuals.  Of course we don't discriminate against anyone, but nevertheless, there are some very smart young folks in our band.    One particularly bright young man is going into the eighth grade and can carry on a conversation as if he were in college. He commented today that he is disgusted with the lack of desire on the part of his colleagues to be more intellegent.  Most particularly, he described improper grammer and a lack of varied vocabulary.    I found myself in agreement with much of what this young man had to say.  I'm not going to say that this is just with "kids today" because it is clearly not.  There were a great number of twerps that couldn't intellegently discuss their way out of a paper bag.  I think society just has a way of weeding those folks out and making them inconsequential to those that want to accomplish something.    I am very pleased that this young man has noticed this and is compelled to tell his peers that say "why do you use such big words" to "open a book or simply listen to intellegent people speak." It gives me great faith in our young people.

       Well here it is...my blog.  The whole concept of blogging is somewhat new to me, but I think it's great.  It promotes writing and creativity in something that you can easily share with others, unlike written journals.    Okay, so enough of the educator popping out.  The basic idea I've had in creating this mamma jamma is to let out some steam.  Like others I suppose I'll share good days and bad days but at least I'll be able to spout off.    I'm going to try to keep this rated at least PG-13 just in case a student should happen to stumble upon it, but I'm not going to be advertising this to students.  I want to say what I honestly feel about things.  But of course now thanks to the Patriot Act and our good friends in the Homeland Security Department (who have nothing better to do than pick the lent out of their rear ends) nothing is really private is it?    So, on with the show.  Thanks for "tuning in."

       Money is a nasty thing.  It's necessary, but nasty.  We spend the majority of our time thinking about it and regardless of if you think you are not concerned with it, it still enters into your mind multiple times daily.    Band directors are perhaps even moreso concerned with the mighty dollar.  We have to worry about paying for travel, instruments, repair, reeds and other supplies (because kids will often have to "charge" and then stiff you on the payment,) music, etc.  If you're worth you're salt as a director and have the people available, you hire private lessons staff and marching tech's, uniforms, entry fees to contests and festivals, etc, etc.    Our budget is not horrid.  We get by fairly well, but a great deal of our expenditures are still bought using raised funds through the parents booster organization.  I got to thinking about all the things we do to raise money and came up with the following:  Supper with Santa  Cookie Dough Calendars Fireworks Solo/Ensemble  We're just about to do the Fireworks stand here in Piggott again.  It's incredibly profitable, but I have never cared much for fireworks.  Especially the minor league stuff you find at roadside stands.  But hey, this is rural America and people love it.  My wife and daughter love it too, so I suppose I'll endure.   To you future band directors out there, here's some advice.  Get used to the idea of doing a lot of fundraising, because it's going to be necessary!  Try to find the one that will require the least amount of effort on your part and certainly the least amount of paperwork.    Supper with Santa is a ton of fun!  You have a chili supper and have Santa Claus available to get his picture made with the kids.  Charge something like $3.00 for the pictures and $4.00 for a meal ticket or $5.00 at the door.  Everyone has a great time, love getting pictures with Santa and don't mind coming as a fundraiser.    Cookie Dough is not terrible and people like it.  We made a lot of money, but there was a lot of time involved.  I suppose it was worth it.   Our band has sold calendars for 50 years!  It's pretty amazing when you think about it.  It takes an amazing amount of work to input birthdays and other listings and collect the order sheets from the kids.  You can make a lot of money, but if I were anywhere else, I don't think I would do them.  But hey...you can't argue with 50 years!   Fireworks are extremely profitable and we have a good source that sets the tent up for us and lets us sell on consignment.   Solo/Ensemble is great too.  We host it for the region and are able to set up our concession stand and we get a portion of the profits.  It's nice to host something and have other schools come in, but the concession money is good also.    So there you have it...a breakdown of our fundraising efforts.  It's amazing to think about the lengths we'll go to raise some money, but it is quite necessary.

       Somewhere in late April through mid-summer, our email boxes begin flooding with job openings from Julia Reynolds the ASBOA Executive Secretary.  Now I am perfectly happy with my job in Piggott.  It's a great place to work and I'm quite content.  But being a young director, I can't shake the interest in what jobs are opening.  So every time I see "Job Opening" as the subject in my email box, I hold my breath a bit to see what tidbit of juicy knowledge I will stumble upon.    More often than not, it is a job in an Arkansas town of which I have never heard and describes duties that are just about impossible for one person to do well. So I began contemplating what the "worst" job opening announcement may look like.  Here's my idea of the worst job known to man in the band world.  Tell me if you can imagine a worse music job:    The Rooster Poot School District announces an immediate opening for Band Director/Elementary Music/Choir Director/ISS Teacher.  The job will include one period of 4th grade beginning band, one period of 5th-12th grade band, one period of choir grades 7-12, elementary music grades K-6 on a two period rotating schedule, one period of high school music appreciation and one period of In-School Suspension supervising.    Rooster Poot has a K-3 campus 10 miles from the middle school/high school campus.  The lunch period is 25 minutes and is right before the elementary music periods begin at the K-3 campus.  We are a growing band program with total program participation (4th-12th grade) at 40 students.  That's up 10 from five years ago.  Our program needs a fresh young face that doesn't mind overlooking a slightly lower pay scale for the benefit of teaching young minds.  With 7 directors in the last 5 years, our students have been taught a variety of different styles, exposing them to all that music has to offer.    Rooster Poot is a charming little town of approximately 200.  Don't worry about big city pollution and noise nearby. We can offer many conveniences in the technology world as our town now offers dial-up internet connection. We're 100 miles from any large cities with 2,500 people or more.  But if medical attention is necessary, we're just a 20 minute helicopter ride from the nearest community hospital which has received regional acclaim!  The Rooster Poot Daily Dispatch rated it as the #1 medical facility in the area.    For more information, contact Supt/Middle & High School Principal John Doe at 501-555-5555.  For more information about the school, visit our website at: www.geocities.com/bourbonstreet/visitors/~roosterpootschooldistrict.com

       My wife and I have joined a fitness center.  This was a tremendous first step in my goal to build muscle mass.  See I've never been all that strong.  In fact, in jr. high school, I was picked on a fair amount.  It wasn't all that much fun, but I learned to deal with it and use my sarcasm as a defense mechanism as I got older.  (I still tend to do so today.)    But lately I've decided that I would like to at least tone the muscle that I have. I may never be huge and I really don't think that I want to be.  As I get older however, I realize that I've got to start taking care of myself.  Perhaps I'll feel better if I build some muscle mass.  I'm not taking any protein supplements or anything.  Just some basic cardio and free weight training.  God-willing, by the end of the summer I'll have a little something to show for the sweat and muscle aches.

       The above is perhaps one of my favorite quotes from an individual that I consider a good friend, Shane Hill.  I refer to this anytime someone does something that makes me scratch my head and get angry.    As you may have read, I went hiking on Friday.  The top of Pinnacle Mountain is absolutely gorgeous.  I love being up there every time I go.  Pinnacle Mountain is a state park here in Arkansas and it's probably my favorite.  When dad and I got to the top the first time, there was a youth group and their guide at the top of the mountain eating a sack lunch.  They were sitting on the rocks at the top and while we took our rest, we couldn't see the rocks on which they were sitting.  So we hiked on down the "Oh My God you actually allow people to hike this" side and then back up.  (I'm so sure someone is going to fall and hurt themselves I'm tempted to coax my father into putting a legal advertisement up there, but he's not as sleasy as I could potentially be.) Upon our return to the top, it was deserted and we could see spray painted words all over the rocks.  It was not inconspicuous either.  Some morons had written there name followed by "wuz here" or some useless verbage like that.    What morons go and do something like that?  How can you climb a mountain and go through all the trouble to get to the top, see something so beautiful and think "now I'm going to ruin part of it for someone else?"  The best way to deal with trash like that is to clean it up immediately once it happens.  It will eventually stop.  At least, that's what all the studies have shown about graffiti.  This is not just a stupid prank, this is someone trying to ruin a great experience for someone else.  After you work so hard getting up either side of the mountain, you deserve to look at nature the way it "naturally" exists.  There's only one thing to say about this:   "People are stupid!"

       Okay, so my golf game on Thursday was actually pretty good.  I birdied a hole for the first time in my life!  For those of you that are not aware, a birdie is when you shoot one stroke under par.  So if par is the number of strokes you are "supposed" to hit on average (which I RARELY do) then a birdie is one better than that.  The pros birdie and par all the time.  I am doing the cracker dance (this one's for you Sara) every time I shoot a boagie (one OVER par.)  My birdie on Thursday was not on a dinky par 3 where I got lucky.  It was on a tough hole.  A par five where I fired the hell out of the ball down the fairway and then again up to the green.  I was quite proud when I finished.    Now on Friday, my father and I went hiking at Pinnacle Mountain just outside of Little Rock.  My father is planning to hike Mt. Rainier (5th highest mountain in the lower 48 states at 14,410 ft.) at the end of this month.  I'm not going to make the trip with him, but I helping him to train.  Pinnacle Mountain has a relatively easy side (which most people can do, but is still something of a workout) and an "Oh my God, you actually allow people to climb this" side.  My dad did this with a 35 pound back on his back and with virtually no stops.  We got up okay but it was tiring.  Getting down took longer because each step literally takes about 5 seconds to determine if you're going to fall and break your neck.  So we went up and down.  Literally up one side and down another.  Then...we went up the "Oh my God, you actually allow people to climb this" side.  My father did this with a 35 pound pack and didn't sit once.  By the time I got to the top I was coaxing him with promises of water to dump on his head to cool him off.  That was perhaps the hardest he's worked climbing in his life.  But he did it and I'm proud of him.    Yesterday at 5:00 my wife, Juli, Donna's Aunt Rose and myself went to the Covocation Center at ASU to try our "free key turn" to win a Corvette given away by a local radio station and car dealer.  (No free advertising today.)  In what was the LONGEST line I have ever and will ever wait in, in my entire life, we got to the entrance of the covocation center 2 hours after we first began.  Then, we were in line for another 3 and a half hours inside waiting to turn the key.  5 and a half hours for me to turn a key taking roughly 10 seconds (you'd better believe that I gave it a few extra tugs) to see if the box would open.  Of course it did not and my 5 and a half hour ordeal hence became the most ridiculous thing I have EVER done and will ever do in my life.  But hey, I was so proud of my accomplishment (actually making it through the line) that I was kind of happy with myself for sticking it out.    Today as I write this I realize that I have had a pretty good couple of days.  Especially if I can write this much about it.  Perhaps you have read this thinking that you will never get this wasted time back again.  You are probably right and I'm sorry, but I felt I should share.

       I love chinese food.  It's one of the greatest foods on the planet, if not the best.  Unfortunately however, I am unable to eat chinese food in moderation.  It's all or nothing baby! As often as I say "I'm not going to stuff myself," I am simply unable to achieve the goal.    I don't think of myself as a glutton.  I eat until I am full and savor delicious flavors of any meal I eat.  I appreciate food and I especially appreciate that there are many without food.  But with chinese, it is so very different.    I think chinese is one of the only foods that you don't realize how full you are until you are finished.  You think "that wasn't so terrible" and then begin to leave.  About five minutes after you have left, your stomache begins sending messages that in fact "you've done it again genious!"    As I sit here writing this entry I am pondering this enigma feeling ungodly full as usual from a delicious chinese meal.  I know it will pass, but when I weigh 700 pounds due to an episode of chinese binge eating I'll definately regret it.

        urlLink    No more chalkboard&nbsp; urlLink     Anyone familiar with our bandroom would know that when you walk in, there was a strangely out-of-place chalkboard embedded into the floor.  This chalkboard has harbored kids who want to go unnoticed for one reason or another, taken-up and limited the setup of the band and simply put, has been an out-dated, unnecessary piece of equipment for many years.    The gentleman whom I teach with has vowed to remove this chalkboard for years.  Finally, he resolved that this is the year that we would rip it out.  As you can see from the picture, the board is now in pieces (look to the floor in the picture for many of them) and all that's left is to cut....that's right, cut the two posts with a reciprocating saw.    For some though that have been here for years longer than I have and remember the chalkboard, it may be hard to say goodbye.  I can see how the board may be an attachment for many.  To this I say only that I am sorry and they are more than welcome to take the remaining pieces of the board home with them.  It would certainly be doing us a favor!   In an attempt to boost the popularity of the band program, we could just leave the posts and find some way to kick field goals during band class.  Bandball?  What do you think?

       My family is absolutely wonderful!  I'm talking of course about my wife and daughter but also of course my other relatives (mom, dad, grandma's, etc.)  Allow me a few moments to discuss why I love my family so much.    My dad is perhaps my best friend in the world.  He is a role model for me and before I make any serious decision in my life, he is among the first people I consult.  My dad is always there if I need help either in moral support, physical effort or financially.  When I lose my father, I will probably be no good to the world for months.  Of course, he is apt to outlive me seeing as how he jogs a half mile solid with a 35 pound backpack every morning and is about to climb Mt. Rainier (14,440 ft.)   My mother and I have been through a lot together.  She gave up working after I was born to be a full-time mother and I have never thanked her as she deserves.  In 1990, she was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and it was difficult for a few years.  She was getting used to living with this disease and so were we.  It wasn't easy, but she never stopped taking care of me and even now, offers to do so much when I know physically that she cannot.  My mother is the most supportive person in my life and I am determined to take care of her for the rest of her life (or mine.)  She deserves it more than anyone will ever know.  She also works out of the home now and works very hard.  Probably more than she should.   My wife and daughter will get their own special post later because I love them so much and have so much to say about them that you simply don't have time to read it all...so more to come on them soon...  Every Sunday, I visit my Granny in Rector.  I started doing this in January when I began directing the church choir at 1st United Methodist Church in Piggott.  She makes lunch for us and we visit weekly during this time.  I've always loved going to my Granny's house because she is a kind, sweet listener who loves me unconditionally and always has great advice.  She also is a reminder to me that life should not always be so fast and that I MUST take time to remember those close to me, because they are the ones that count the most.  I look forward to going to her house each and every Sunday and I wouldn't trade those few hours for anything!   My Nina (other grandmother)is truly amazing.  She gets around as well and better than many people in their 30's!  She volunteers to keep my daughter Juli for us when we need to be at work or just to go out on a date now and again.  I know that she and Juli are great friends and she loves her unconditionally.  Nina has always been supportive of me in life and while she could buy a new home with the amount of pictures she takes, I love all of them and am thankful that she takes them.  She's the glue of our family and I will never be able to repay her for what she does for all of us.    So there you have it.  There are others of course that deserve mention, but this is it for now.  I get to thinking about how lucky I am from time-to-time and this seemed to be a nice tribute to them.  I wish everyone had such a great family, but I know there is none better.  I thank God for these people in my life and will never be able to appropriately put into words how truly blessed I feel.  Bless you all and happy Father's Day!

       Well, the day before yesterday, my father called me and informed me that he had in fact made it to the top of Mt. Rainier in Washington state.  Mt. Rainier is 14,410 ft. tall!  I'm very proud of his efforts to get ready for the trip and of course making the conquest.    When I picked him up at the airport yesterday, I saw him coming down the terminal looking very much like an 80+ year old man with arthritis.  So apparantly, he was quite sore.  He had already informed me on the telephone that he was sick and needed me to pick up a prescription for him.    He told me that from the camp at the halfway point, they woke up at 10:00 pm (after having slept for only 4 hours) in the dark to prepare for the ascent to the summit.  At 8:30 am the next morning they had made it to the top.  Apparantly, it's a good thing that they go up in the dark because on the way down in the light, you see just how dangerous it really was.  So when he arrived back at the camp from the summit, the rangers told him that he had "acute mountain sickness."  It was recommended that he go back down to the bottom of the mountain and get away from the extreme altitude.  On the way down, he was not doing well physically, but made it on mostly his own power.    I just wanted to share this with everyone so you can see just how extreme my father is.  He is very glad that he achieved this goal and I'm very proud of him.  He said that this will do it for him and mountain climbing.

       My daughter is really something else.  She is the sweetest little girl imaginable and very bright.  Juli is five years old and I love her so much, sometimes its more than I can bare.    Juli says the funniest things without really trying to be funny.  I know there are a lot of kids like that, but she really does take the cake.  She wants to be a cheerleader, a flute player, a dancer and a "tree doctor."  I don't really know why she wants to be a tree doctor, buy hey, that's fine with me.    She has been in preschool and made so many friends, I know she can't wait to get to Kingergarten.  Juli is indeed my little buddy and I am determined that this kid will grow up to be a true success in life with a good foundation of moral character.  Sure that may sound like a cliche, but it's harder to do than you may imagine.  Look around at all the kids that don't fit that particular description.    Juli and I are pals and I pray constantly that we stay that way.  I love her more than she'll know and I hope everyone reading this either already has or aspires to have such a joy in their lives.

       Okay so now I have some more evidence (as if we need any more) that there is far too much stupidity in the world.    Our annual 4th of July festivities includes the band playing in the town parade and at the picnic thereafter.  Naturally, everyone's cases are unattended for a brief time while they play on the stage in the park.    Someone (we think we know who it is, but to be on the safe side, I will assume that we do not) decided to take it upon themselves to settle a little personal conflict with a band member by taking a certain amount of horse waste and dumping it in their instrument case.    Now if that isn't stupid enough for you, there are a few witnesses that saw a particular individual with a cup full of the stuff walking around the area where the cases are.  Whatever happened to the good old days when a couple of kids would just have it out in the parking lot?  Vandalism like this is pathetic and is in my book a display of how there are simply too many people in society that will become a drain on the rest of us.   ...In case you were wondering, I believe we have gotten the smell out of the case.

       Yesterday in the late afternoon, I was working on my blog and just about ready to leave for choir practice when I started reaching in my pocket for my keys and they weren't there.  Generally this is not a big problem, because I often leave them on the desk or by the printer in the bandroom.  Upon inspecting all the possible locations, I realize that they are in fact NOT anywhere to be found.  I then realize that I left them by the copier in the main building.    My key ring has ALL my keys, including the one to the main building on it.  So this begins to pose a problem.  First, because I am due at the church in about 15 minutes and have no way to drive my car and second because I would like to get home at some point that evening.  So I tried calling a few different folks to come unlock the building, but was unable to locate anyone.  I finally have to call the church and arrange for someone to pick me up and take me to practice.  (I figured I'd deal with the keys later.)  Now as if this frustration isn't enough, as I push away from my desk, a very large stinging insect decides that he's going to dig in like it's nobody's business.  After giving the insect a very strong tongue lashing (using many colorful metaphors) and then stomping him to a pulp, I realize that this thing is not a bumble bee and is not a wasp.  I didn't think it was a hornet because hornets are usually small.  Well, I found out later that there are some hornets that are quite large and hurt like the dickens.    So once I've been picked up with no keys but a great deal of pain in my hand, I go to choir practice.  I then begin the first anthem that we are due to sing on Sunday.  It sounds like we've never seen the thing!  I was already quite mad and that didn't help.  I "almost" threw a jumbo sized fit most often seen in Jr. Band the week before concert festival, but quickly reminded myself that this is a volunteer choir and they are all my elders.    I made a few suggestions and we went on to have a pretty good and productive rehearsal.  Once that was finished I tried not one, two, three or four people, but FIVE people until I finally found someone that was home to let me in the building.  God bless them for their help.  After that, things got much better, but things sure weren't going my way for a few hours. Hopefully today will be fine.   By the way, I hope you all enjoyed the audio blog.  I will probably do a few of those entries when I'm at ABA and am not at my computer.

       I decided that instead of burdening everyone with my political views here, I would post them on a separate blog.  Check it out at www.presidentialpolitics.blogspot.com

       Okay, it's now time for me to shamelessly plug my political views for a moment.    When I saw that John Kerry brought John Edwards onto his Presidential ticket I was VERY relieved.  Not surprised, but relieved.  John Edwards is a great man for whom I have a great deal of respect.    In my opinion, Dubya (George W. Bush) has made a complete mess in less than 4 years of a solid society built by the Clinton administration over a period of 8 years.  It's not beyond repair of course.  I'm also not going to pretend that with Kerry in office, within 30 days, all of our problems will be solved.  That's simply not going to happen.    But I believe that John Kerry will be able to redirect us in a direction that is positive for all Americans.  Dubya strikes me as being a pleasant guy.  I'm sure I'd love to sit and have a cup of coffee with him and shoot the breeze, but that doesn't make him my choice for our Commander in Chief, Chief Executive Officer and Head of State.    I'm sure there will be some other posts that outline more specific feelings toward their political ideaology, but this post is the first to clearly define my political feelings for this election.    Now it's time for the convention...Quick!  To the bat cave.

       I take for granted how lucky I was growing up and don't realize that everyone doesn't grow up as I did.  I had a wonderful childhood for the most part and can't really complain about too much.  But let me give you a little (non-specific) information about a young lady that truly amazes me.    There is a young lady that I got to spend some time with teaching this summer that really impressed me.  She had a wonderful personality and a work ethic that was quite superior.  This girl seemed to have not a worry in the world.  When I returned to my home, I began getting some email correspondence from her.  Without getting specific, this young lady asked for my prayers because a family member was having some very difficult times and it was causing strain on the entire family.    The more I read about this and received updates, the more I felt terrible that she was in that position.  She continually said that she wanted God's will to prevail and that she trusted in him.  I admire that depth of faith and would like to say that I share it with her.    I found out that all this started just BEFORE the period of time that I taught her.  How amazing!  This girl set aside all of her personal difficulties and gave 100% of her concentration to what I was trying to teach her.  This is very amazing to me and I know that she will go far.    It appears now that things are better with her family and I know that she seems to be more relieved.  I will keep praying for her, not only for relief of her personal difficulty, but also that she will succeed and go on to great things.

       Okay folks, I'm back from ABA (Arkansas Bandmasters Association Convention) and about to start marching band again.  I realize that I haven't posted in a few weeks.  This is largely because I have been going in a million directions.  That's odd because I've been working steadily all summer.   The conference was great.  I got to know lots of folks that I hadn't met and went to some very interesting clinics.  The mayor of Fort Smith made a presentation at the business luncheon and he reminded me of a slightly younger Ross Perot.  Also...what's with this expression "Life's Worth Living in Fort Smith, Arkansas!"  It seems that everyone in Ft. Smith knows this expression and is ready to recite it at a moment's notice.  So today, we meet with student staff.  It will be nice to see them all again.  I'm a little worried about the number of kids we'll be having in band, but I suppose that it will all work itself out.  Tracy isn't worried, but then again, he's been doing it for over twenty years.  Well, more to come soon...I promise.
