      Well, I reckon this is nigh right. A quaint mat, rubbered letters... "Welcome" and all that Vegas pizazz about it to boot. "Oh please do come in, I've not much, (drink?) but feel free to take advantage of what bit I do.  (Oh yes please.) Excepting/Exempting today and placing it into a bracket of thoughts never to be returned to; I've been feeling a great sense of finality to many things. (And some butter on your (fee-figh-fo-fum) bread?) I'm rather but yet casually sure that it started about three days ago with a dream. (Certainly) it always starts that way though, nix that, so I had a nightmarish hallucination of complexity where.. well, I don't remember but it's sum effect was that of a premonition, of me absolutely deadening myself to intrapersonality [and no, that is not a word]. By that non-word I mean, that in this dream I broke off all the vital contacts in my life through uncaring. My parents, and friends to some extent. It was odd; I woke up thinking about how much money I would get if I could cash in on my parents' life insurance. I laid on my floor [where i've been sleeping] and just twisted that thought around and around. I realized, if they'd die I wouldn't have to worry much about money for the rest of my life so long as I invested it wisely and in my deadened half-sleep I was roused by this prospect because,  not only would my fianances be set, I would have emotional damage, or at worst, a superficial artifice of emotional damage [which actually at this point seemed idyllic] that, by victimizing me, would give me license to act as I pleased. In fact, It would be the closest thing to freedom I can think of knowing. Like real, tangible freedom; from people, from institution, from gravity. It'd be so nice. Then I opened my eyes and felt guilty that I got so excited about my parents' demise. I carried that about with me for two or three days all the while picking up new things. Graduates leaving, the last factory on earth, lots of things. I think I started to manifest some somber weather but it wasn't green, [it's never green (pisses me off so much, I could just use  some melancholy green sunlight from time to time (like the kind you get through old grimy glass when it is in the shape of a pryamid  where which you lie in for a thousand years and more on an opium binge,  with none but spectres about to you))]. It was grey and blhue, and it drizzled much of the time. there was a cool breeze, that normally won't be felt until late fall, about October's end [keep in mind though, that this was by no means a winter wind; it was not crisp enough, it was the breeze that cools your life to embers; forlorn alongside a creek that doesn't flow, I submit my gaze. I realized, just now, that I like this breeze.
