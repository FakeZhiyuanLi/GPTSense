      Well it's been a couple weeks so I figured I should make a new post.   I'm about to head back to school this Friday. :p School doesn't start for another 10 days but why let that stop me? Actually I have to go back so early for training as I continue my year and a half of work as a Community Assistant in the resident halls.  I don't know, 33+ hours of training for a job I've done before with much less training time seems a bit excessive.  I'm sure I'll need all 10 days to remember how to do my job. ':/ The best part is that I might get stuck with a roommate at the last minute.  They haven't told me anything yet, but some freshman could try to get a room in the last week before school and I would be stuck with her, maybe for the entire semester or year!  What benefit is there to my job if I don't even get my own room?! It's a good thing I spent the summer with roommates, that should hopefully prepare me for the worst.  I'll just have to see how things go, maybe the week of training will be great. :p At least I'll have plenty of time to get things set up before classes start, and I should have no trouble buying used text books.  I've got packing to do, later.

      Howdy folks, thanks for stopping by to check out the barnyard.  Here is a place for random stuff I like.  I like very random stuff so don't expect a lot of sense to be found here. :)  I am in my last days at the University of Kansas.  I've spent the summer here doing a National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  I've had a great time and I miss Kansas just thinking about leaving on Wednesday, but it turns out that no, I'm not an ecologist after all, I'm a little too interested in the human factor and am more of an environmentalist.  So I've figured out one thing I don't want to do for grad school but now it's time to decide and I still don't know what I would like to do.  It's worse than in normal college and you know how long it took me to figure out where I was going there (or perhaps you don't know, it took me 3 years in a 2 year college to figure out what I wanted to do, then I stayed around another year to get in some more mostly free education and try to get a scholarship to another school and now I'm going into my third year there.  I expect I'll have well over 200 credits overall before I get my BS...).  I have to get going to a museum tour and I don't know who I'd expect to see this seeing as I haven't told anyone where to find it if I mentioned it to them at all, but I wanted to have something up for someone to read if only it's just me the next time I stop by.  Have a great day!  Becky
