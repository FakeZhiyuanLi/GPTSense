       Erm... i now currently studying in balestier ite Precision Engineering for about 8 months ler..;) At the beginning of the semester at january u will feel veri instrested with this course cause u will be learning to be come a machinist and i have a confident in getting gd result is because out of the 2 core modue i of them i have learn before in secondary so i onli got another machine to learn. So now i in the 2nd semester i now learning another 2 machine which are surface grinding(Sg) and cylindrical grinding(Cg).this two machine is more difficute and dangerouse to use but it give a more presize job and veri nice finish to the workpiece.So that is wat i have learn so far hope i can go thought this....haha :)
