      I'm not a fast food junkie, and from working at both McDonald's and Roy Rogers for a brief time during my adolescence, I know all too well why one should not eat fast food.  But every now and again I give in to the convenience and hope that this time, this time it will taste good.  With that said, I like Chick-Fil-A more so than any other fast food joint.  But I have always found it interesting that a fast food chain very openly integrates Christianity with their business plan.  They explain why they are closed on Sundays via a plaque as you walk in and on their  urlLink website .  (Read more about Truett Cathy, the founder of Chick-Fil-A, and his Christian principles on page twelve and thirteen of this  urlLink story .)  I just find this all very interesting for a fast food restaurant is all.  Now if they were pushing some type of liberal pagan screed, I guarantee that double chin O'Reilly would be calling for a boycott.    But it is also just a bit creepy to eat there.  First off, you're greeted with: "It's a great Day at Chick-Fil-A, how can I help you?" and when your order is complete, it's been their "pleasure"  Those poor children.  Probably making no more than a dime over minimum wage and they have to utter that crap at every customer.  I know I would never make it, but I guess they don't mind. The last time I was there, a couple of the employees along with their manager were quoting biblical passages back and forth to one another.  Now that was a bit much.  But what really makes me laugh is that when you buy a breakfast meal, you get a free copy of the Moonie Times.  What a tired rag, even if it is ran by our savior, Rev. Sun Myung Moon.  If the people at Chick-Fil-A even had the slightest knowledge of the blasphemous blather of this nincompoop, they would burn his paper on the spot.  To find out more about this loon, check out the following salon articles:  - urlLink Hail to the Moon king , all about his crowning ceremony in DC to celebrate his national tour of tearing down crucifixes across the US. -and  urlLink Bad Moon on the rise  where we find:  His gospel: Jesus failed because he never attained worldly power. Moon will succeed, he says, by purifying our sex-corrupted culture, and that includes cleaning up gays ("dung-eating dogs," as he calls them) and American women ("a line of prostitutes"). Jews had better repent, too. (Moon claims that the Holocaust was payback for the crucifixion of Christ: "Through the principle of indemnity, Hitler killed 6 million Jews.")     But I suppose Rev Moon can't be all that bad, according to him both Hitler and Stalin have endorsed him as  urlLink "none other than humanity's Savior, Messiah, Returning Lord and True Parent."   And that type of sponsorship you just don't make up.

      A day after Cheney  urlLink claims  al-Qaida was linked to Saddam, we learn via Drudge that the 911 commission  urlLink reports  no credible ties with al-Qaida were found.      "Bin Laden is said to have requested space to establish training camps, as well as assistance in procuring weapons, but Iraq apparently never responded," the report said. "There have been reports that contacts between Iraq and al-Qaida also occurred" after bin Laden moved his operations to Afghanistan in 1996, "but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship," it said.  "Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties existed between al-Qaida and Iraq," the report said.       Drudge, who is a massive tool, finds Dan Rather giving Clinton new book five stars far more shocking, locating the 911 commission blurb off to the side.  Of course, seeing how Drudge's readership is 87% Clinton-Hating-Conservatives (okay, I made that statistic up) his headline priorities are legitimate.  Honestly, this all leads me to believe that the only way the Bush apparatchiks would question Dear Leader's actions was if Bush pulled Clinton up on stage and started to make out with him.  What does Bush have to do to lose their vote?

      I just finished reading the latest book by David Sedaris entitled Dress Your Family in corduroy and Denim, and it fell below my expectations.  Aside from hearing Sedaris on NPR, the only other book of his I have read is Me Talk Pretty One Day, which I enjoyed immensely.    Overall he is very skilled at telling a story with his style being clean, neat, and crisp.  One is able to breeze through his books quickly because they are an assortment of light and humorous essays.  But I also feel as if this type of presentation is a limitation of the author as I find myself loosing interest towards the end of each essay as the story grows stale.  There are also parts in the book where he leaps from humor to a more serious and formal tone, but doesn't quite make the transition work.  David Sedaris has a great talent for cocktail party anecdotes, but he could never master a full novel.  Parts of the book also seem to be written not for their humor, but of quite praise for his family members with a scent of hope for forgiveness in using them in previous writings.  That being said, I am still a fan.  His humor is biting and at several places in the book I laughed out loud.  He is able to take an typical happening and deliver in such a way that makes it completely unique.  He knows where his powers lay in writing and he leans on them with great success.     I give this book 3 stars out of 5 as only 3/5 of the book is worth reading.  It's a good read all the way through, but perhaps if he had waited to publish he could have weeded out the less humorous stories for better ones.

      So the drive would only be about an hour for me, while others are coming all the way from California to view former President Ronald Reagan in DC.  And I am not going to go.  I don't want to, simple as that.  I have plans for the rest of the week that are far more appealing to me than standing in line for over three hours with a bunch of weeping and overtly historical people reassuring themselves that Reagan was not only the greatest president ever, but somehow we will be able to carry on without him.    I was born in 1980, a little over a month after Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, so I really don't remember that much about him.  I have read several articles about Reagan, and I must say I'm glad I was too young to known or care about what was going on.  Cause I'd be pissed off.  The unconstitutional covert operations, the refusal to even talk about the on going epidemic, and his callousness towards the general population forces me to wonder how could a man like that get into office?  But what I find most amusing is the current myth making the media is partaking in.  Go read  urlLink Reagan's Liberal Legacy  by Joshua Green.  It's funny how a party will sacrifice what ever principle necessary and fall in line behind a man of the hour.  The same thing is happening with the current administration, as no true conservative could support Bush.  Of course the conservatives/republicans do not have a monopoly in regards to that vice either.  After hearing clips of the speeches Reagan gave over the years (I barley remember his Challenger speech) I can understand why people desperately cling to the perception of his greatness.  He was a monumental leader even if where he took us was in the wrong direction.  He was moving, charismatic, and cathedral.  I find none of these qualities in the current President, which I guess is a good thing.  With as much shit as Bush pulls off, imagine if he were fully competent.  Reagan even, well to some degree, excepted responsibility for his administration's actions.  Bush honestly believes that he is on God's mission and can't possible make a mistake.  And to question his command is unamerican and treasonous.     But what I don't get is Christopher Hitchens.  In his  urlLink article , he calls Reagan dumb as a stump, but yet he worships Bush.  I suppose this article was written long before he had his melt down.  Poor Chris, such talent now wasted on the dark side.

      For about three years now I have read several different blogs, each one having a profound effect on my political and social views.  It all started with Andrew Sullivan, who I use to admire until he morphed into the unapologetic hack I suppose he always was.  For the blogs I currently read on a daily basis check the links on the right of this page.    I'm trying to learn HTML now so I can make this blog a better and less generic looking piece of shit that you find in most pages around here.  I'm not sure what I'll write about, or how often I'll write.  I'm a shitty writer and I doubt anyone will read this anyway, so I suppose it all doesn't matter.

      I watched three speeches last night on TV from Beantowne by way of FOX News, cause I'm a sick mo fo.  I didn't have the sound on during most of Ron Reagan's speech, I started to listen to it but the delivery was awful.  He had this look on his face and sound in his voice that turned me off.  Obama was wonderful, what a great speaker he truly is.  I know that everyone in the Democratic side has high expectations for him, and I can understand why.   I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefits because they were Reservists.  When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they are going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never, ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world...........  ......Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.  Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America.  There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America.  The pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue States: red states for Republicans, blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states.  We coach little league in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states.  There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq, and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq.  We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.   And then there was Teresa Heinz-Kerry, what a firecracker.  It's nice to have a potential first lady that is more than just a quite token,with a carved out smile holding back her Valium.  Even my Grandmother likes Heinz-Kerry, and she hates Hillary.  Funny enough she actually likes Bill.   Her: Did you watch the convention last night? Me: No, I had to work, so I missed it. Her:Well, Clinton gave a really great speech, he's such a smart man.  And he is so handsome, he was wearing a beautiful suit and tie. Me: Yeah, he's lost some weight too I think. Her: He has lost a lot of weight.  Well, no, not a lot, not too much.  He looked so good though.  But that Hillary, she looked as awful and dopey as ever.

      So, some conservatives are upset that Cheny swore, and White House insiders  urlLink fear  that it will cost the BC04 some votes.  I really don't buy into this, I mean who the hell else are conservatives going to vote for in November?    But it's funny to see  urlLink Drudge  give headline coverage to Kerry's wife because she told a reporter to  SHOVE IT .  Not quite the same though, is it?  Cheny told a Senator to  GO FUCK YOURSELF , which seems to me, oh I don't know, something that overtly crazy and  urlLink angry  Howard Dean might have done.  He was one crazy man.

      So I don't get this Berger story at all.&nbsp; One would hope that with an investigation going on since October that the story would be&nbsp; cut and dry.&nbsp; Instead, it's as if it just took place and no one is sure what really happened and who did what.   Frankly I expect more from&nbsp;the former National Security Advisor to Clenis.&nbsp; Yes, they are only copies of the original documents, documents that he probably helped create.&nbsp; And on can argue that maybe because of this, Berger, in a lapse of judgment, didn't see it as a violation to walk out with them.&nbsp; But that excuse is simply not good enough.&nbsp; "My&nbsp;bad" doesn't cut it when you are at his level.&nbsp;   But I refuse to believe that he hide documents in his socks.&nbsp; That is completely absurd.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the individuals that work at the Archives who reported that is what they saw, why didn't CNN question them.&nbsp;    CNN :&nbsp; So you witnessed Sandy Berger remove documents from the Archives?   ANON : Yes, he stuffed some papers in his jacket, pants, and socks.   CNN :&nbsp;You mean he placed papers in his pockets and what he couldn't fit there he rolled up his pants leg, pulled back his socks, and crammed what he could there as well?   ANON : Yeah, pathetic isn't it, he must have really wanted to hide something bad.   CNN : Well, I suppose so.&nbsp; If I saw him do this it would really make me wonder what would make him go to such lengths to hide.&nbsp; Didn't you wonder, didn't it make you raise your eyebrows?   ANON :&nbsp; Yes, very much so.&nbsp; His actions were near treason.   CNN :&nbsp; And you just let him walk out the door, after watching him stuff his pockets?   ANON:  Yes.   CNN : And socks?   ANON :&nbsp; Well, um, yes.   CNN :&nbsp; And it didn't occur to you to call security then, to stop him at the door?   ANON : Um, well.......   CNN :&nbsp; Well, why didn't you stop him?   ANON :&nbsp; Well, because I'm a douchbag.   This is why I hate reporters.&nbsp; They want a lead so bad, they talk to anyone and print anything.&nbsp; No matter how stupid it sounds, no questions asked.   This is why I hate reporters.&nbsp; They are all douchbags.

      From  urlLink Rittenhouse Review  (who was notified by someone else) comes this  urlLink article  from the Baltimore Sun.  But before I explain why I find it worthy to note, there are two other things I want to say to my legion of readers.  First, Jim runs a great blog.  The kind I would love to have, but for several reasons I can't.  Partly because for me to even put up one post may take up to an hour or more, and as I work two jobs, that is time that I don't have.  And also due to the fact  that I lack original ideas.  As much as I'm interested in politics, I'm constantly amazed at how little I know.  But that's why I travel to other blogs online, giving me the opportunity to steal their ideas and present them to my peers as my own.  Jim is a skilled writer (although at times I want to sneak into his house at night and pry off that comma key), a talent that eludes me.    Secondly I really don't read newspapers very often, not even online.  While young my family subscribed to The Aegis (a third rate rag even by local county newspaper standards) and the Baltimore Sun.  My Dad ended the subscription to the Sun when the delivery guy kept tossing it into the mud instead of putting it in the box.  This happened when I was eight or so, and at the point my reading interests had yet to surpassed the comic section.  I'm really not sure what this paragraph is about or going so I'll get back to the article at hand.  I, as you might have guessed by now, live in Baltimore City.  While today's kids might call it Charm City, when I was growing up it was, and always will be to me, The City That Reads (even if it is closing library branches on a regular basis).  That means that I live in Maryland too, a state that is not considered a  urlLink swing state  .  However, upon googling, I  urlLink found  that since 1948, out of the 14 elections that were held, Maryland electoral votes went to a republican 42% of the time (6 times).  Votes went to Reagan in 1984 and his sidekick Bush Sr. in 1988.  This doesn't seem as likely now to happen as the popular vote gap between Republicans vs. Democrats has widen since 1988 to favor Democrats to a safe degree.  Hence, we are not a swing state.      That is why I voted for Nader in 2000.  I knew he would make a lousy president, but that was the beauty of it, he wasn't going to become president.  I think it's important to support a third party candidacy, giving another voice a chance in hope that the voice leads to some kind of change.  During the 2000 election I felt both candidacies, Gore and Bush, where two men trying to sell the same platform.  I didn't see a big difference between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Which frankly, I feel that in the grand scheme of things, they aren't all that different.  Both parties have sold out long ago to the highest bidders and are very good at getting very little done.   But Bush is different.  He has done things that I thought the shackles of bureaucracy would have stopped.  I know that 9/11 changed everything, primarily causing the Democrats to put their tail between their legs and form a puddle on the floor.  But I'm still amazed at what he was allowed to get away with.  And that's why I'm voting for Kerry.  Even though he has Maryland in the bag, I'm throwing my support behind him.     And I wish Nader would see this too.  He can still fight and try to change things for the better, but running for President is not the way to go.    "I'm going to take more votes away from Bush than from Kerry," he claims. Yet the overwhelming majority of polls say just the opposite. And by selecting a vice presidential candidate who will be anathema to conservatives, Mr. Nader indicated that defeating Mr. Bush is actually quite low on his list of priorities.

      Last week I saw three films in this order: 1. Saved 2. Fahrenheit 9/11 3. Spiderman 2  Originally I, along with some friends, went to the  urlLink Charles  to see Fahrenheit 9/11 on Sunday, but it were sold out so we saw Saved instead.  It was defiantly a smart alternative, a delightful romp if you must.  Funny and cute, it was like Mean Girls, but about the confusion a young mind encounters with Christianity instead of popularity.  Some, particularly those that saw The Passion of The Christ 437 times, will easily dismiss it.  In the film, each character's blind devotion and all consuming faith in Christianity hinders them from asking any question regarding their viewpoints, choices and actions.  The antagonists, a Jewish girl and a wheelchair bound MaCaulay Culkin are great.    I'm not saying it is a profound film and should be taken seriously, it is still a comedy in the end.  And I must add that I really like Mandy Moore more and more.  Out of all the girls, (Brittany, Christina, Jessica) I find her the most sincere and naturally beautiful.  She does a wonderful job in this film although I have trouble believing she has any range at all as an actress.  As for  Fahrenheit 9/11, I defer you to  urlLink Paul Krugman's  take, which fits mine rather well.  As for the flaws Krugman notes, Spinsanity has done all the  urlLink research  for me.  I like Moore, sometimes.  When he acts like the Ann Coulter of the left I wish he'd shut up.  I feel that making Bush look bad is easy, but in his typically style, he just had to resort to half truths to make his point and grab some headlines.  I guess noting the pipeline will make people's eye grow larger than telling people how Bush&Co steamrolled the CIA into giving them the info in the way they wanted it.    Overall, there was very little I already hadn't read somewhere online at sometime.  Everything else I met with skepticism.  Now if only the media had done their job two years ago, this movie (it is certainly not a documentary as it is not objective) would had never been made.  The worst was that there was a guy selling Tshits outside the theater with a headshot of Prez 39 and 41 with the caption Dumb and Dumber.  Come on now, we're better than that.  I know the guy was only trying to make a quick buck, but how insightful are those tshits?  Not very.  It caused me to roll my eyes in the same fashion as when those wacky Bush backers calls John Kerry the "friend of the French."  As for Spiderman 2, it kicked ass.  The only inevitable problem is that the more successful it becomes, the more others try to ride the wave with crappy clones (Daredevil anyone?).    The next installment is due in three years and though I know what it will be about(the ending is none to subtle), I still wonder what it will be about.  Is Peter's inner turmoil being Spiderman over?  Will he and Mary Jane get their freak on?  Will Aunt Mae have to sell her pain pills on the street to make rent?  Will Harry Osborn give into his lust for Peter and become his new arch enemy, The Turd Burglar?   On a side note, I always thought  urlLink Franco  was extremely beautiful since I discovered him in Freaks and Geeks, a series that (I'm still bitter) was yanked from the air.  He has nice lips, high cheekbones, and great, wonderful, bedroom eyes.  But he doesn't look good in this film, nor the first one.  My guess is that because Tobey Maguire is the star but also homely looking, the crew had to make Spiderman's future enemy less attractive.  Even though a bad day for Franco is still an unattainable good day for Maguire.

      So the couple I had slept with back during winter came into work this weekend.    I really did have a lot of fun while in their company, I even remember laughing out loud with them which is something I hardly ever do.  But it was just a lot of work, and they really are not a healthy couple.    Initially I was really attracted to AA more than RN, see as I thought RN didn't like me at all.  But the more I got to know AA, his favoring fell more and more.  He likes to start shit and has a very childish side to him.  I don't trust him and put him in the same category as CK, someone I would rather just not know.  I find RN far more attractive, but than I wonder why he stays with AA.  I suppose the reason is that while most gay men are dicks, a majority are also wimpy, pathetic, whinny and far too passive.  AA is more assertive and a bit kinky, and in that respect more of a typical guy (i.e. heterosexual).  So on that level he is more attractive than most, only because most are rather lackluster.  But he is also controlling, crafty and unstable, the boy has issues.  He is not, and never will be, boyfriend material.  The antics he pulls sometimes with other boys I would never put up with in a relationship.  And that is why I have distanced myself from him, and by consequence them.  But I also thought that they broke up.  Anyway, JM called me as well.  I was hoping he was too embarrassed to ever take me up on my offer for a drink.  Lord knows that if I had ever abashed myself like that while under the influence, the last thing I would do is have drinks with the violated party.  And as conceited as this is, what makes him think that I would be interested?  I'm no top prize, but damn, I do try to take care of myself.  I have far more interesting hobbies than getting high, drinking, and hanging out with dykes.  I bet the boy hasn't read a book in ten years.  He is overweight, has bad skin, bad teeth and is victim to all those unflattering characteristics mention in the former paragraph.  And the worst thing, he's an unapologetic slob.  Years ago during my party days, I, along with other friends, went to his place to get high.  When we entered his room we had to push clothing (dirty and clean alike), magazines and other miscellaneous crap aside to sit on the floor.  It felt gross to be there, my skin crawled.  Then, after some tokes, he casually picked up one of the several 2 liter soda bottles off the floor, removed the cap, and took a swig of warm soda.  He was kind enough to offer everyone else a drink, but I politely declined.  I know I sound like a snob, so I guess I am.  But keep in mind those things don't bother me when the person is a friend.  However, when they try to push for more than a friendship, those unfavorable characteristics swirl in my mind making me dizzy to a point where I want to vomit.

       Note: This post is a bit long and I fear I sound like one of those crazy cat persons.  Please don't think of me as such, I'm really far more of a crazy dog person.  But in the past two years cats have begun to grow on me, and with my current living situation I can only get a cat.  I'm not home enough as sometimes I work almost 12 hour days, and I feel mean keeping a dog in an apartment all day.    On my Mom's farm, there is this long haired male cat that showed up out of the blue about a year ago.  Since then he has managed to knock up every barn cat, some at least three times since his arrival.  The only cat I'm aware of that he hasn't made preggers is Roof Cat, the cat that sits on the barn roof all day (hence the name), but she is non to friendly to begin with.  Now that I think of it, I don't even know if Roof Cat is male or female, no one has ever gotten that close to it.  Any way, long haired male was at it again, recently two of the female cats produced litters.    Bobo, the bobtailed cat had three.  All three look the same, grey with dark stripes and white paws.  Except that one has a tail and the other two take after their mother with only a stub.  For some reason whenever long haired male mates with Bobo, his long hair trait becomes recessive.  These kittens, as all other kittens from this pair before them, are short haired.  My sister's cat Hokie (it's a Virginia Tech thing) is from Bobo and long haired male, she is short haired with a normal tail. These kittens are about two weeks old, and currently reside in the empty calf hutch used to store straw.  Bobo, not the prettiest cat by far, is friendly enough to let anyone come in and pet them or pick them up.  She is cool like that.  Another litter was produced by Bobo's sister (my oldest sister, who apparently knows the barn cat genealogy better than anyone else, told me of this relation).  She had two kittens, and they are the best litter she has ever had, from what I hear.  Bobo's sister likes to hide her kittens until they are much older.  There are a lot of foxes and other predators around, and a mother must be careful.    Unlike Bobo, Bobo's sister always has long haired cats.  My Mom's cat, Indie is from this pair and he is long haired, as well as Fuzzy Cat, another barn cat.  My youngest sister's cat, Mascot, I believe is from this pair (she is fuzzy) but I'll have to check with my oldest sister as I'm not too sure.  The best thing about these long haired cats is that with their soft hair, they don't shed much at all.  You can barely even tell my Mom even has a cat.  I was looking at the bob tail kittens, but I think I'm going to go with the long haired.  My sister said that in another week Bobo's sister will probably bring them from across the street to start feeding with the other cats (my sister gives them milk in the mornings) and she will snatch one for me.

      I meant to post this sometime ago, but forgot.  Every now and again people will highjack book reviews at Amazon.com and hilarity will must assuredly ensue.  The first time I saw this tomfoolery was with the Bible, I'm not sure which version as this was four years ago.  Back then, anyone could log in as the editor or author of the book.  Well, someone logged in as the author Jesus and wrote:   Honestly, not my best work  I know, it's stupid and lame, and doesn't make any sense as Jesus didn't even write the bible.  But I'm easily amused.  But people with too much time on their hands (mostly bloggers I assume) were at it again.  About a month ago they started to do book reviews for My Pet Goat, the book Dear Leader was reading while our nation was under attack.  Here are the  urlLink reviews  Amazon pulled down.

      I really don't read Michelle Malkin much as she makes me feel dirty.  And I'm not talking about Christina Aguilera dirty, oh no, it's much worse than that.  In her new book,  urlLink  In Defense of Internment:  Why all foreigners are filthy dogs  The Case for "Racial Profiling",   she outlines why putting the Japanese in camps during WWII was necessary (I haven't read the book, but I bet it has to do something with Pearl Harbor and them being our enemy or something, but that's just a guess).  Here are some highlights:     What the West Coast relocation centers were really like: tens of thousands of ethnic Japanese were allowed to leave; hundreds voluntarily chose to move in -- and many residents even protested their closing!  You see, they could have left anytime they wanted, is not like there was a  urlLink chain link fence with barbed wire  or anything keeping them there.   they were nothing at all like the Nazi death camps to which they are often compared by craven and opportunistic alarmists on the Left.   To be fair, she is right.  It's not like we gassed them or anything.  But those standards are a bit low, I think.  When you have the very agency in charge of the relocation  urlLink stating  that that the housing provided was "subnormal and probably always will" and that they were nothing more than "tarpaper-covered barracks of simple frame construction without plumbing or cooking facilities of any kind. [...] one bath, laundry, and toilet building shared by upwards of 250 people." It doesn't sound all that great either.   Another forgotten bit of history: the February 1942 Japanese attack on Goleta, California -- the first foreign attack on the U.S. mainland since the War of 1812   This is an interesting, sure.  But all the ship did was fire a small gun shooting up a wooden pier.   Like the  urlLink Fu-Go  weapons, it could have been worse, something that we should all be thankful wasn't.  But this is more of trivia type information than anything else, and these actions were understandable as we were at war.  So what's her point?    Only that she's a racist bigot, like those that support her.  The worst thing is, they can get away with this because she's  urlLink Asian .

         Last week I bought a bright pink, squishy stuffed Dolphin from the  WHOI  gift shop.  I knew that if anyone could think of a name for it, it would be my friend  Marshall .    He looked at it, thought for a second, and then quoted Mr. Jack Handy:   "If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong, though. It's Hambone."    Hambone the dolphin is everyone's favorite toy now.  Mostly because he's so squishy; you can throw him and catch him and use him as a pillow.  However, it is not cool ( Yaron , I am looking in your direction) to shove Hambone's tail fin up his butt and make fun of him for it.

      At my other  urlLink job , I typically get bored.  They really don't give me much work to do, and by that, I mean any.  From time to time they will come up with meanial tasks for me to preform, but even then I manage to put them off.  But the pay is great and I get to go online and read all day.  However, I'm more than ready to leave.  I think it's a bit early in my life to become this lazy, plus I think I've milked it for all it's worth.  Now don't think I sit on my butt all day, I do get some stuff done.  Just look at this piece of art I made for the wall outside my cubical:        Clockwise the characters are:  urlLink Picard ,  urlLink Riker ,  urlLink Crusher ,  urlLink Worf ,  urlLink Q ,  urlLink Wesley ,  urlLink The Borg Queen ,  urlLink Yar ,  urlLink Guinan ,  urlLink La Forge ,  urlLink Data , and  urlLink Troi .  The  urlLink Enterprise D  is on the minute hand with a  urlLink Romulan Warbird  on the hour.  Now you maybe surprised that art made with such fine craftsmanship has some minor errors (which were quickly pointed out by several of the engineer/trekies in my office).  The ships are not to scale, as the Warbird is, from what information The Federation has, twice the size of Enterprise D. (Don't you love the fact that this ship, nay the entire Romulan species, was created by someome's imgaintion but that someone takes it so seriously  as to say we have limited intellegence about them.)  Also, Miss Thang, Queen of The Borg, was never technecailly in an episode of Star Trek TNG, as we first see her in the movie First Contact (the best one if you ask me).  However, Picard knew her from when he was asimulated during the series, so in a way, she was.  And frankly, I like the bitch.  I know she tried to travel back in time to assimliate Earth, but  I'm sure she had the best of intentions.

      Yesterday while working at Ikea:    Customer : Excuse me, I'm looking for straws, the bending kind.  Myself : Well, the kind that we have are over in cookshop.  (I casually point in that direction.)   C :Yeah, all I saw are those pink and gray ones.  M :Yes, those are what we carry.  C :But I bought these longer bendy ones here before.  M :How long ago?  C :About three months ago I guess.  M :Ah, those were a summer item, we're out of stock on those.  (Now there really are summer items we only carry at the beginning of summer, and once we sell them there are gone.  But I have no idea what he is talking about,  lately I've been using this excuse on items I'm not familiar with.)    C :Okay, so where are they?  Me :Well, we're sold out, we don't have anymore.  C :So you don't have any around the store?  M :No.    Keep in mind that this stuff happens all day long at the store.  People ask questions about stock, prices, directions, and then they don't listen.  The other day a Lady asked me how to get to the checkouts.  I started to tell her to go straight ahead, turn left down the main isle and she would see them.  Before I even told her to take a left she raised her hands in despair as if I was assaulting her with an overload of information.  So I just pointed in the directions and said "That way."  She took ten steps, turn back towards me, and said "This Way?"  I nodded yes.  Then another ten steps, "Am I going in the right direction?"  As I turned around to tell her she had to keep going, I noticed she was standing under a very large sign (I think the letters alone are over a foot tall), with an arrow pointing ahead saying CHECKOUT.

      I've been spending the summer at a sort of   math camp  for big kids, and it is almost drawing to a close.  I'm sad to leave my camp friends, and what's more I'm wondering if I used my time here wisely.  In particular, I'm wondering whether my life was sufficiently different in their eyes to make them wonder  why  the life of a Christian is different from that of everyone else.  In english: did I act like a Christian this summer? And why should the Christian life be different?  A quote from the Apostle Paul:    "For we do not want you be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life; indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; who delivered us from so great a peril of death, and will deliver us, He on whom we have set our hope." (2 Corinthians 1:8-10).   I love verses like that -- the ones that show that Christian strength is, to the naked eye, a fool's hope, like Frodo standing at the foot of Mount Doom (Christian geeks like them some LOTR references!).  But it's built on a victory that has already been won.  But.  It's so hard for me,  soooo hard , to believe that I have a hope that overcomes any and all despair that life might bring.  I know it in my mind, but I can't believe it in my heart.  Except...that I am starting to, slowly.  It is just so hard to communicate this to anyone else.  Life never got so hard this summer that my faith stuck out as different from or stronger than my friends' vague agnostic faiths in whatever.  Nor was my research so infused with the holy spirit that I mathematically unravelled the laws of physics in a fascinating and elegant superproject and I didn't, as I originally hoped, come up with any lovely musings on the  mathematical beauty of God's creation.  Mostly, my summer project is sucking as much as, if not more than, everyone else's.  So where has my life been different?  Maybe,  hopefully  in the little things.

      Every now and then I develop a crush on a movie trailer, usually for the way it gives little glimpses of the intriguing lives of these characters, matching those glimpses up perfectly with some catchy tunes.  I almost like movie trailers better than actual movies.  So right now I like watching  the  trailer for the movie  Garden State .    I got a little nancy drew (not hard, when you have ye olde internet) and deduced that the two songs in it are  Such Great Heights  by The Postal Service and  Love Will Come Through  by Travis.  They would make such good background in the trailer for the movie about my summer of 2004.  For lack of such a movie, I am playlisting them for a CD that I will make for the aforementioned boy I have a crush on.  Speaking of which, I'm sick today and he came to visit me.  I'm about 3 seconds away from falling in love, but I'm holding back because I'm too afraid of the consequences.  More about this at my  other  blog.

      I have been going to this  urlLink other dude’s  blog lately, and my penis envy is rising. Although, even though his blog is really good, and he sort of sounds like the drag queen I’ve always wanted to be, he still gets filed away in my little box for “kids who are not that much younger than me but younger enough that they just don’t get it.” By “It,” I mean, the notion that one is never as attractive as they think they are.  I can think of several times, when I was younger (not much, I'm 26 now), and cuter, that I totally thought people would just take what I put out at face value because I had such a cute face.  This is kind of like that "spice-girls"-type feminism; it demeans everyone, including yourself.   In other news, I have been listening a lot to Dolly Parton lately, moreso than I used to.  I found this new album, "Trio," which features the music stylings of dolly, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris.  Now, I wouldn't by any stretch of the imagination classify myself as a person who likes country at all, but I really like this.  And for one as unpatriotic as myself, I feel like this is a big step for me.  Of course, they don't really ever sing about pride of country , more about broken hearts and lovers who have left them (of course, the idea that any man would leave Dolly Parton is just laughable).  Anyways, I've got to be moving on.

      Sigh.  If only someone had told me  urlLink this  long ago, I wouldn't have wasted all that time singing to I'm Every Women.

      Hey guys, welcome to Baltimore's Finest Trash, all the trash that's fit to print.  I'm not to sure what powers you guys have, I think you are only "guests" or whatever.  But make  yourself at home, do whatever you want here.  Originally this was going to be some type of political blog, but then I realized that I'm really more of a consumer than a creator as I was barely even turning out twice-warmed over news every other week.   I only ask that you keep you entry titles somewhat reasonably short.  If they are to long then they mess up the formatting of the left column.  I've learned some html, but I'm still very limited in what I can do.  I've turned comments back on so we can comment on each other post.  Also, there are several ways to post an image online.  You first need to upload it online.  I use  urlLink this  free picture hosting webpage, and link to the photos by html.   If you see anything you want me to change, add, or you have any questions, just send me an email.

      So the boys from Baltimore let me post on their blog.  I don't even live in B-More, plus I'm a religious nut, so what am I doing here?  Yay for discourse.    I've started watching TV again, which is bad because I already don't have enough time to do all the ~useful~ things I'm supposed to do.  Specifially, I watch reruns of  Angel  that my friend Dave downloads off the web.  Yeah: 2 years of watching almost no television, might as well go straight to the WB.   We start around midnight every night, and go till about sunrise.  It's been 4 days, and we're about halfway through season 2.  Every morning when I trundle into the office feeling like a thousand pounds of tired, I declare that the night before was the last night I'm doing this, and then Dave says something about how Darla is going to come back pregnant with Angel's baby, and then I have to watch more. Also, lots of the characters often wear cool knitted stuff and that gives me ideas for what I want to make.   The other reason I keep coming back is because it means 4 hours of huddling on the couch with my pal Boober, on whom I have a crush.    Finish my thesis?  Never!

      I went to Craig’s List for the first time ever.  It’s pretty cool because I often have useless things of which I must dispose.  I also found out that it’s easy to find a sexual mate on this list.  The people are pretty skanky, though, and I think that there are a small number of people who keep on putting the same thing up.  Either they are big fans or just really desparate, it’s anyone’s guess.  My new favorite show is 90210…again!  I just found out that it shows on FX, and ever since then I have been avidly following the crazy adventures of Dylan, Brendan, David, and company.  I’m so glad that Brenda got booted from the show.  Regardless of being a bitch and a bad actress, she was also quite homely.  Andrea Zuckerman was trash, too.  She never belonged on that show, and outlived her pitiful usefulness quite some time ago.  Maybe I’m getting too involved in this.  In the process of trying to think of witty things to put in for the rest of the day, I have failed miserably.  I think that this means I am not as funny or as clever as I usually think I am.
