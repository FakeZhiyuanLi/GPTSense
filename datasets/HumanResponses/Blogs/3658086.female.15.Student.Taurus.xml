      OMG. I am so unbelievably p**s*d off.. seriously I'm gonna go mad soon. Certain people in my year are so out of order its not even funny.. some people think they can tell me what to do.. dunno how that works. I've just been informed (to my face aswell) that I am up myself because I said that without me and charlotte (the two strongest girls in our year) doing the tug of war they were pretty screwd. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. and a certain person (ask me about that... not writing down any names in case someone unwelcome is reading this..) seems to think that they are some bl**dy genious who should really be in set 1 for everything (their set 4 ratio is v. v. high) and that she is in fact ,uch cleverer than she really is.. o and did I forget to mention talented in every way... grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr I'm so angry. anyway i have to go and write some sh***y report that I have been ordered to write by... yes thats right one of my friends.. grrrrrrr omg I'm such a b***h

      Ok, ao the exams are over.. I guess thats kinda good, but now looking back I wish I hadnt been so lazy and I'd actually bothered to revise. Oh well... cant change the past so I guess I'm gonna have to learn from my mistakes. anyway, tje most positive aspects of my life are the moment are; 1. the exams are over. 2. lucy. There arent anymore. I've discovered that i can't communicate through words.. I have to either write down my thoughts or put them on here. People seem to think that I am really hard and that I can cope with anything.. but being completely honest, I cant.. its all an act. I know I joke about my experiences with counselling and seem reluctant to go, but before I actually went I was full of hope because I thought that maybe this would be the way to sort me out. Now I know it hasnt worked and I dont know where to go from here. I am stuck on a downwards spiral and I cant get out of it, because I dont know how.I thoguht counselling might help me but it didnt so now I'm all out of hope. At the moment I feel as though I dont actually have any true friends.. I get on with alot of people because I have to.. I'm not going any further in to it (christie this doesnt include you, I get on with you because i want to). I feel as though noone really cares about me anymore. Everyone thinks I've got past it, but I havnt, it gets worse and worse every day. Everyone around me seems to be so happy all the time, so I pretend to avoid bringing others down. i bottle everything up so everyone thinks I'm ok, but deep down it hurts so much. Noone seems to realise that I am puttin gon this huge act so that people like me. People are only interested in the old kaz who was always making jokes and having fun, and i am trying so hard to be like that, but I always know that deep down thats not how i'm feeling. It's like I'm hiding behind a mask and noone can see behind it, and hardly anyone even realises its there. I cant talk about it properly because I find it really hard to get the words out. I hate pretending all the time. I feel so alone, like noone understands me. Sometimes I have to get out of my room because i am so scared of what I might do to myself if i stay there any longer. had a huge argumet with christie but i think thats on its way to being sorted out and its going to make our friendship alot stronger. instead of talking to anyone about it though, I took it out on myself. I dont know why i do it though. I get this thought in my head andI have to do it. i have to punish myself for being such an idiot. I dont know why, I just cant help it.I know i need to do something about it, but counselling didnt work, and now I'm all out of ideas. I am stuck here in this time of my life and i cant see the end of it. I cant see there being a future.. itjust seems as though i'm never gonna be who I used to be again. I hate who I am at the moment more than I  hate muriel and thats saying something gotta go

      I have just come back from athletics... running up and down the astro non stop for, what... bout 20 mins... not really my idea of fun... anyhow, i've been rather p****d off today... had an argument with christie, and as you are probably reading this, I would like to take this oppertunity to appologise for my behaviour... i know i can be a prize k**b at times and I'd like to appologise for that. However, I would still like you to take in to account what I said as it does upset me. Anyway... I have succesfully failed all of my exams... except maybe french... music tomorrow, and latin... anyone know anything about Sagae Thesalae that they would care to share with me??... he he, that reminds me of miss simpsons lessons... when talking about covalent bonding... now children.. they're caring sharing electron.. (see me if you want to see my impression... its not so funny written down.. bit like achoo!) love you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Just come back from chapel... v. boring lecture on homeless people... nearly fell asleep, and that was meant to be brief?!?!? Anyway, wasnt really what I needed having just walked 16 miles in two days, and camping over night. D of E is in fact a nightmare, and so conveniently placed... the weekend before our exams... fantastic. When I got back discovered 5 texts and 7 missed calls, most of which were from lucy. She was kinda wondrin why I hadnt answered my phone for two days! Anyway, having sweet talked my way out of that one, she is once again happy with me!!!!!!!!!! She was taking the p*** about me and my sex life which i thought was rather rude!! Anywayz, I talk about her too much!!! Having not checked my email since friday night, I sat down at the computer happily expecting a few emails... my inbox was in fact empty!!!! anyway i'm off... laterz

      I am once again happy, despite muriels best attempts to piss me off so much that i go mad! one downer was that i had an argument with charlie... but i think that can be sorted. Anyway for those who were wondering what has made me so happy... apart from those lesbianic rumblings going on in jenni's room...! I will inform you. As you may know (well, as you do know as I have already mentioned this in one of my previous thingies) yesterday, I got through some pictures of my girlfriend lucy.. Now, having inspected them for a very long time, I have decided that (apart from being a bit of a kev) she is quite cute and that I love her more and more every day!!!! Noone believes me when I say I love her but I do... step aside miss belcher, you are no longer top of my list!!!!! la di da di da... ok... enough about lucy although I could talk about her endlessly!!! :-) i need to put some pics on my blog........ how does one do that??!!! If anyone wants to see the pictures they only have to ask!! I will be happy to show you and talk about it for hours on end.... I've been playing my guitar... v. relaxing... suddenly felt the need to come and write in my blog! 5 in a day... I think I am becoming obsessed with my blog, so i am going to resist writing anymore... I'm off to moisturise my legs and play the guitar some more... oh and Deya "Who's so phoney, always surrounded? stop your screaming - noone can hear. The scars on your skin 'post no bills'.. who you were, was so beautiful, remember who you were. Hide from the mirror - the cracks and memories. Hide from your family - they wont know you now. For all the holes in our souls hots no thrills. Who you were, was so beautiful. Memories who - Who you were" I love you... remember that xxxxxxxxxxx

      That... was shit. I'm not doing another sesion. I'm sorry Jen I know you want me to but I can't`. I just feel as though she is trying to get inside my brain, which admittedly is what she's meant to do. but i dont want her there. I feel as though she only wants to talk to me so that she can nose into my life... I kno thats not true because she is just doing her job. i dont like her asking me personal questions about my life.. she doesnt need to kno. i just want to forget about most of it, unless i'm thinking about it and then i just talk it through with one of my freinds (i love you guys) and then its fine... i mean, these sesions make me think about it when i dont want to. i hate it.. at the moment i feel as though mrs marshall is actually my mum, i mean, i dont have a good relationship with my mum, partly because she's normally to pissed to talk to me, but i cant talk to her at all... mrs marshall is always there, she gives me hugs, great advise, which is exactly what i need, but dont seem to be able to get... does anyone else have a shit relationship with their parents... how do you deal with it??? to add to it i've lost one of my best friends... henry, for those who dont know about that, he sent me an email saying that I wave my arm around for attention.. on the contrary (i threw that in for you jen!) i cut myself on my upper arms or on my leg so that noone can see.... dont really understand how that is attention seeking.. one of his other points was that apparently I'm saying that I am a lesbian for attention aswell... He thinks i should tell every guy i fancy about that... I mean we are talking little crushes... or more like, I'm pretending to like them to cover up my true sexuality... I'm not gonna bloody marry them for fucks sake!!! so i got really pissed off by him and now we are no longer friends.. bit silly if you ask me to throw away a friendship that has been going on for years... oh well. i guess its kinda his loss not mine. couldn't give a shit about anything anymore.. i wanna curl up and die.. maybe thats a bit extreme but thats how it feels at the moment... gtg save christie from wierdos in the computer centre  laterz xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      i dont bloody wanna go. Its not even funny. So yeh I joke about her and say she is fat and ginger etc, but now i've actually got to go and talk to her. its so awkard being in a room with someone that you dont even know for a whole hour.. i cant stand it, I dont need counselling.. fucking hell... there is nothing i can do to get out of it, without either really upsetting mrs marshall or getting expelled.. shit shit shit shit shit. i'm gonna go mad..... shit. i need to talk to someone... I FUCKING HATE LIFE. seriously... i'm bloody scared...

      I've discovered over the past week that I am OBSESSED with muse... (well they are amazing). I am also finding it difficult to go for 5 mins without looking at my blog or someone elses... v. worrying! at least i'm getting it all out i guess. My favourite muse song by far has to be screenager... listen to it again anyone who's reading this... how amazing is his voice?! Deya... I dont mean this to be offensive but you really need to listen to the lyrics.. I think they are true of you... (does that make sense?) Dont take that badly please!!! I think that you would understand what I am trying to say to you through the words of Muse.. plus you can't shout backat me!!! just remember I'm always here and I love you.. xxx Oh yeh... just while I remember... thanks for everything Jenni... I know I probably get annoying after a bit, but thank for letting me talk to you etc.. you're a legend. Especially thanks for coming to see Mrs M with me... it cant have been nice for you either xxx  I love you all!! (but i love luce more!!!) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      This didn't work last time, so once again I'm going to write about my sad little life!!!! Having discovered blogs yesterday, I found that Jenni was right (as normal)a blog is a really good way to sort your life out so to speak. I am having quite a good day today... maths with megahey, exhilerating as always!! Anyway....... I've been quite happy this week due to getting back with Luce!!! Got some pictures through of her yesterday aswell, so if I've got a permanent smile on my face thats why!! On the bad side tho I have fallen out with henry pretty much for good, which really got me down. I take it out on myself... shouldnt do that. Need to stop with the whole self harm thing. Anyway.. I'm really worried about Deya... come and talk to me any time mate... noone will be told (except maybe muriel..!!!) Ahhhh counselling today.... I'm really worried about it.. I dont like it!! grrr...4words ginger scottish fat muriel! Another thing I've had on my mind but never really talked to anyone about (except Katie the gappy... legend!) is my faith in god.... sounds silly i kno.. but over the past however long, I have been doubting god... my theory; I am a Christian, yet there are people that aren't, and they get easy lives... doesnt really seem fair... so I kinda thought well maybe there isnt a god.. but having been a christian all my life (too many lessons with stevo soz!) I never really tried to admit this to my mum or my sister coz they would have gone mad!! but I kinda think I do believe in god, kind of because I'm scared not to (devil and all that)... and after long chats with katie, I have decided that I do believe and started praying etc again... any thoughts on that??? better go anyway, I meant to be practicing!! laterz
