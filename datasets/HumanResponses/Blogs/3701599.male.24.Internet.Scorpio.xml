      The beauty and the dread. Sometimes it's heavenly, having to relate to people, being blessed by the closeness and love that being with human beings brings. It's just that maintenance gets so hard sometimes. Expectation, desire, misunderstanding, pride; such sometimes insidious patterns creep in whether from within or without- and the heavenly bliss of earthly relationship is rudely shattered by words like, "I have a problem, why do you always..." Or the like. Claiming ignorance of the "massive issue" is never quite the right response in these times. Ah, it can get so complicated.  There's health in this confusion, I guess. Rubbing against the rough may not be comfortable but it sure does great things to a piece of iron. Being tired of itchy relationships, I guess I tend to forget that that very situation, though painful to experience, makes me (if suitably self aware) able to learn, to grow, to live more effectively (ironically, the very characteristics that make me human). There you have it, I have one more thing to learn. Or more accurately, I have a thing to learn with every difficult relationsip that comes my way. I guess I could think about it like being shown a mirror once in a while, even if is a cracked up old thing, and instead of complaining about the lacklustre piece(s) of glass, I use the opportunity to comb my hair. Or shave. Or wax my legs, the point has been made.  There you have it - my first official blog. You'd think I should have tried harder. I'd think so too. Yet for what it's worth whoopie, I'mma done blogged my heart out.

       urlLink CHUD - Cinematic Happenings Under Development   Love without the bonds of morality: Love transcends morality. Love and morality have no link whatever. Is this an accurate representation of the mind of our age? Maybe I'm suffering from a severe case of (false) superiority, I hope not... I'd rather it be a case of severe desire for a higher standard.  So I watch a movie looking to gain insight on the past and in doing so I hope to gain lessons for the future, some that would never really apply to me but in a microcosm of the scale of the tale. Ultimately however, as I sit among a theater-full, I realise that this is not what people come for, at least not the majority. Instead, for the guy, the girls are cute and the fights are fun; for the woman the guys are attractive and adorable and oh! The kissing, how romantic...  And so another briny wave of raw emotionalism and passion erodes the stone of considered morality. Nothing against passion, but even the hippies had the background of a brain...? Where do we stand today? Thinking is for the mind, not the skin.

      They say love is an action well maybe I agree But how do I deal with  the way that I feel? Does it mean that I'm only lacking self control or can I be excused for having a soul?  I want you forever but you're not mine to get I don't even know  if you have the same regret They say holding on  to dreams is insane but I'd rather be crazy than empty and plain  so humor the dreamer allow me my folly what else do I have I don't care what you call me My one true request that my heart is screaming is to turn your eyes to me and end this my dreaming

       urlLink Firefox - The Browser, Reloaded  OK, took the plunge, made the change - IE to FireFox. Am I a pawn in the hands of the masses? A pathetic compromiser? Who knows. Maybe my life in the complex world of XHTML and CSS and Standards has changed forever. Maybe it's not that and I've just switched to a faster browser. Who knows, time will tell. I hope I don't have to switch back for some stupid reason.

      Okay it's an old story, but I felt like I needed to write, and plus it clarifies the previous blog. It's my corner of the web, you go get your own.  There once was a frog. There also was a river. Frogs, as you may know, do well with water. There also was a scorpion. Frogs, as you may know, don't do well with scorpions. In fact most things don't do well with scorpions, me included.  So the scorpion came to the river. He realised his dilemma immediately, because he wanted across, and as you may know, rivers don't do well with scorpions. Or vice versa, I forget just now. Well, the scorpion spotted the frog, who was trying to make himself scarce, for reasons we at least now should be aware of. The scorpion called out to the frog and asked him for a ride. As we expect, the frog was incredulous. "Me, give you a ride? Are you serious? You'd only bite me as soon as you get a chance". The scorpion replied,"That's illogical. I need to cross the river. Me biting you would defeat the purpose, we'd both end up wet. Tell you what. You take me across, I'll owe you one." Not many frogs were owed by scorpions in those times. As I think of it, situation is quite the same today for some reason.  Back to the story - the frog thought about it, and what the scorpion said made sense, you have to agree. Scorpions were quite rational that way. So, he called the scorpion and told him to hop on. All went well, till they were halfway across the river. Right about then, the scorpion aimed a lethal hit right on the frog's rump (not aware of what the technical term is, or if frogs actually have one). The frog cried out, "aaaah", and died.  Wait, I missed a little detail. The frog didn't exactly die after the "aaaah", if I remember the story. I shall call this section, the "Lost Dialogue of the Frog & Scorpion". After being bit, the frog said to the scorpion, "That made no sense. Now you die too - how does that help anyone?" The scorpion replied, "I know that - but it's my character".

       Okay, okay, so I can't but help be a little philosophical. It's who I am.  Like that scorpion sitting on the frog who was carrying it across the river,  know that story? So here's me being philosophical:
