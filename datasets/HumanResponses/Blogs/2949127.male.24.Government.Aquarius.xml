      Today was the best surf I've caught in some time , I surfed the powerplant with shane from my paramedic class , hes a big fan of the don patrol so we left this morning at about 5am , we then arrived at the powerplant in Stuart to see perfect head high plus a-frame peaks , it was the best surf I've caught in some time , we surfed from 7 am until noon only stopping for a quick lunch , then back to the beach , I was so exhausted I had to lie down,  face first in the sand . What a freeing feeling . That only lasted about 5min when the next set came through and woke me right up , I ran grabbed my board and surfed for another 3 hours, when my arms turned into jello . We got home around 630 and I was face first in my bed sand and all.

      No pics of the surfrider foundation shindig , my camera is dead , (the batteries) who knew that the charger for the camera needs to be purchased separately . Great idea though . Well it was a good time. I think I got a contact buzz if you know what I mean . No wonder surfers get the typical stoner stereotype , the majority are ... I'll just have to agree with people when they do those ridiculous impersonations .

      The day is Tuesday , I just got off work , taxes are a disappointment , but what's new at least there done . I have to learn today , paramedic class starts at 1500hrs .   I found myself thinking about my bro last night at work , I am still in disbelief  that I can't just call him and tell of my week or day or anything at all. I took advantage of having a brother for so long. I then started thinking. What if it was me , and what would I change about my life ,,, would I quit work and travel till I was overcome by the cancer. Or would I try to fight it and pretend like everything was going to be ok . I don't know if I'll ever know . I just don't want regrets , I want to be free of all things (including myself if it makes any sense) . I want to wake one day and not have the power line jungle buzzing in my ear .

Two fires one pediatric trauma alert and a late dinner , we're still going , today has been much busier than yesterday its amazing how it fluctuates like that .   on to bigger and more interesting things. It is my good friend Stevens birthday today , he turns 25 . Wish I could be at bar having a pint with him . But since I can't maybe all that read this can raise their glass and wish Steve the best as he grows old and decreped .

      Today I have entered the world of cool . I am on my way to being the internet savvy guy that I have dream of . All apologies if I vent a bit , this is tj s outlet . ......... My mother asked me the other day how I was doing , and if I had someone to talk to .  I know I have plenty of people around me that will listen , but its as if I fell like I'm whining to them and trying to make up feelings . That's enough from me for now....

      House fires are the best . We had a good structure fire last night. The call came in around 2am for smoke and flames showing. When we arrived on scene the front of the house was full of black smoke. We walked around back and found flames shooting out of two bedrooms . The fire was all the way to the floor , and I think I got a tan from the heat . We fought the fire for a solid hour and by the time it was out the building was about to collapse and there was one dog dead. We did manage to keep the front of the house from falling victim to the fire . And there were no people hurt in the fire . All in all this is what I joined the fire service for .

      The day started relatively the same as any other. Woke up around 10am to my sauna of a room. Sweating from sleeping in my jeans again , I swear they are like a child's security blanket for me. One day I'll grow out of them . Anyway back to my day , my buddy called about 10:30 talking of going diving. Of coarse I immediately jumped out of bed and got my gear together to meet him on his 34ft venture. We were heading out to spearfish in about 100ft of water. My first deep dive on nitrox . First dive was 110ft a nice reef with a plentiful sea life at the bottom . After 35min. On the bottom we had bagged six mutton snapper . Which I'm told are very good eaten . We hung out on the boat the recommended time before going down for are second dive , this time on oxygen , in about 65 - 75 Ft of water and shot another 8 mutton. After are second dive we were all pretty tired and decided to try to beat the storms that were rapidly approaching, so we headed in for the day . Well we didn't beat the rain but it was well worth it . I wish I could do that everyday , but its back to work tomorrow .

      I am about half way through the most eventful yet uneventful day I've had in some time and it feels great , the day started when I got off work this morning . Followed by a slow drive by the beach to see how flat it was "lake Atlantic". Then a quick stop by island to look at boards I'm not going to buy . Topped off with an hour nap by Shannon's pool . Sometimes you just need to do nothing for yourself , take it from me it feels great .

      Well about this time tomorrow I'll be in Tamarindo, Costa Rica . I can't wait . The waves are chest high right now and they are getting a new south swell today. So it should be 8-10 Ft the entire time I am down there . I am going to try to keep a travel journal that I can transfer to the blog when I get back on June 1st . I am looking forward to telling everyone all about my adventures .

      Its incredible that I am typing so well , considering I tried to cut off my finger today. Ok so its not that bad but it is eye opening how much you use your hands in your daily deeds . I was helping my dad work on the corvette today we are putting a new carb on . Everything was going together perfectly until I was cutting some hose with the wrong side of the knife and pressing down on the very sharp side with my index finger when the knife easily sliced through my finger . I think I'll live to hurt myself another day . Until next time , stay away from sharp knives .

      Well Shannon and I are back from our road trip . We trekked 2500 miles. Driving through Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, to Tennessee where we stayed at Shannon's grandmothers home in Memphis for two days, checking out downtown Bealle St and Mudd Island before stopping at the world famous Randevous restaurant for some down home BBQ,(I got ribs Shannon had some beans and slaw.)we then headed for southern Illinois through Kentucky. When we finally made it we were so tired , we decided to take it easy and go to sleep early to be refreshed for the following mornings festivities . We had lunch over at my aunt Cathy's . Played with my cousin Kelly's kids Owen Tate and Wyatt Clayton (just a little southern ) later that day we went out to the lake with my cousin Kevin and his groomsmen (did I not mention the reason for the trip? My cousin is throwing his life away and getting married, kidding .. He is very happy and we are all excited for him , his wife Jennifer is an amazing girl who is sure to make him an honest man . ) at the lake we did some tubing behind one of the boats , we are so beat up . Well the wedding went off without a catch and kev and jen should be in Jamaica now , sitting on the beach getting fried . Shannon and I finished our trip driving back down through Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and finally back in Florida. Its good to be back , now I really should get back to that studying thing .

      Well I am back from Costa Rica , and back to I-95 , 90 degree weather, and lake Atlantic. The trip went well, we stayed at some sick places , one was a two story house on tamarindo bay . I managed to get the room with the jacuzi tub and private patio (go figure) , the wasn't to good but at least i surfed every day , sometime we got four sessions in one day , the first day the surf was about 8ft at a place called little Hawaii , in the first hour mark broke his 9'0" Walden . Then the rain came it lasted four days most of them the wind was on it , so the wave were kind of blown out . During this time we surfed playa Negra , playa Grande , and tamarindo bay. On the sixth day we woke up at 4am and drove to playa del coco to take a bout trip to witches rock and ollies point , the swell was fading and the waves dropped to about 4ft . It was lined up though so we ended up scoring some good surf . After witches and ollies we headed to Boca barranca for the firefighters surf contest . Our accommodations were unreal , we stayed in an all inclusive resort , that's right free booze all we could drink . The hotel also had a casino in it , i won $60 playing blackjack . Needless to say I'm ready for Vegas . The contest went well we earned third place in the team division . i ended up getting knocked out in the semifinals . Not quite as good as last year but I'm going to blame it on the dirty rivermouth we were surfing in . To be continued ....

      As some of you may or may not know its lobster mini season. And for the past two days I've been &nbsp;in the water looking for those sneaky bastards for a combined total of 14hrs. The first day we went down to the seven mile bridge in the keys where we bagged a total of 21 lobsters , then today we went locally and got skunked only getting 2 . I guess I can't complain to much . All of&nbsp;you that are reading this were probably at work .

      It has been a while since I've updated everyone on what's going on in my world, so I thought I would give it a try. I've been doing a lot of spearfishing lately. Just got off the boat today we didn't get much just one hogfish , even though we were on some good reefs off of john u loyd state parks. We were free diving in 25-35ft. There was one shark , about ten 50 pound snook, five or so rays one spotted , and a good size eel. All in all we had a great time just being in the water .  Last day at work we gad a ripping house fire with flame shooting out of the roof . We managed to get the fire out in about 30min. With no injuries and saved the structure from a total loss.  my mom and I went bowling tonight , I'll be going pro soon . I had my best score ever a 166 . Pretty bad ass huh. Beat that Shannon.
