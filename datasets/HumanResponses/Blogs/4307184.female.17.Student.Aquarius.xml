Y.S. can say that i'm a good gf to you cos i'm brave to fight for my love but i feel that when she say this to you, she is trying to make you feel happy.. that what i feel in my place as a gf.. cause she is my enemy.. i'm childish... but that me.. i'm 17... ya.. i can be mature sometime as you said.. but at times, i will still go back to my old self, my age.. sorry.. i love you.. that why i possessive... if i dun love you, why would i care so much.. that kind of kpo to know who you with and will not stop you from been close with them de.. maybe i really need to be more understanding.. to stand at your view to interpret thing.. i will try to learn to be.. hopefully, one days, we can be the happiest couple..

      Today I was late for my tuition... reaching my tuition kid's house, thinking that today i would be getting my tuition fee.. $200 but end up after the tuition then i found out the cheque date written 5 sept... wow liao... still got two weeks then can get my money... why like that one... how can you treat me like this.. i need money for my allowance and my dear dear chalet.. why can't it be cash... sian diao.. then i went to clementi interchange to buy lor lame with rice for dear dear to eat for his lunch.. i hadn't eaten for that day except a packet of milk.. firstly, my back tooth is growing.. i had been suffering for the past 3 days.. Pain!! sob sob.. after buying, i took 99 to jurong shopping center to bring lunch for my dear dear... upon reaching there, he was busy with his stuff... didn't even bother about me while i stood outside the shop waiting impatiently for him to finish his stuff.. he finally opened the door for me, took the lunch from me and asked me to go home.. i was so pissed off at that moment, luckily the uncle asked me in and gave me a chair to sit so that i got place to eat my lunch too... i'm currently on diet so i only ate fried banana for my lunch, before that i bought a cup of watermelon with lemon juice when i was on my way from clementi interchange.. then sat inside the shop to eat with him.. stupid jer, didn't appreciate me for been so nice to send him food.. not a thanks from him.. sob sob.. swear this will be the first and last time cause i didn't like the idea that his ex-gf, lynn bought the same food for him before.. so i don't like to be replacement.. thus, i can buy other food but not that food again.. hee.. i'm stubborn.. don't like to be the same.. then i sat there, chatting with dear dear and uncle jimmy.. ya... even went to buy toto and 4D for them and myself.. just now check on the 4D, dear dear nearly win.. he bought 8717, but it came out 8787. If he had just guess my year then he will win.. why guess my year and age together.. hai.. no faith with the 5 thousand.. hopefully toto can win... a few hundred also not bad.. hee.. uncle jimmy insisted that i had to stay until 5.30 then can let me off.. by then, it's late and i'm tired cause yesterday slept at 4 plus and woke up today at early 8 plus for tuition.. i took a cab home though i knew it's a waste of money.. the stupid driver, only asked him one question and he kept continued to talk to me, i just hoped to catch some rest ma.. but he didn't wish me to do so.. hai.. sob sob.. reached home at 5.50.. i immediately went to sleep.. halfway, i heard that my sister and her family had arrived.. i don't bother about them, though i heard that my nephew tried to open my door, but didn't manage to do so.. heng.. but unluckily, he was so pathetic noisy, made me so pissed off that i got up, opened the door and shouted, can you remain silent and shut the door.. i could see that my sister was terrified by my action.. mum told her that i was so tired.. just reached home, wanting to get some sleep.. but didn't manage to sleep better, i woke up shortly to eat my dinner.. i was having the same stuff as my nephew and niece.. guess what.. porridge.. cause my tooth ache.. argh.. seem like baby food.. haha... time passes very fast... 9 plus le.. then they went home... i was now online.. later going to study my macroeconomic.. tomorrow.. first test in poly... wonder how will it be like... hee... must get as many AD as possible.. i want to get one thousand dollar scholarship.. hee.. this is my aim.. money money.. can't help it... i'm a very calculative person since young.. that make me perfect in my maths.. hee.. sorry.. a bit thick skin.. hee.. shall end here... continue tomorrow.. hee..
