       If you hate politics, skip the next paragraph.   The election is over.  A couple months of campaigning, one day of elections, and we know who our Prime Minister is.  Take that U.S.A.!  Canada rules!  or does it?  I keep hearing the same thing over and over again.  I don't like the Liberal leader, but i like their local candidate.  I want Paul Martin to win, but i don't want to vote for the local Liberal... and on and on and on.  So we need to change the system.  I believe we need to cast a vote directly for our country's leader.  Anyways, they all look the same to me.  I'll put them with the other 'Leader' beans...  Alright, enough about the election.  It's over for 5 more years.    Yesterday i was in the library looking for a book.  I couldn't find the latest Harry Potter adventure.  So i walked out of there with a copy of  Lady Chatterly's Lover  by  D.H. Lawrence .  How's that for a stretch?  I read the first two chapters last night and it seems excellent, once you can figure out the early 20th century english.  I saw two squirrels chasing each other around a tree trunk the other day.  Or was it one squirrel running really fast.  And if it was only one squirrel, did  he  know that?  Things that make you go hmmmmm.  I have a new poll on my blog.  I had no idea what to make the poll about, just that i wanted one on my site ~ so i took the impending Canada Day theme and made it somewhat patriotic.  Make sure you click on the poll before you leave the page!  If you have any ideas for another poll hit me up with it and i'll do it later.   Hell, i dont have anything better to do, hehe.   Predictions... yes.  This year the New York Yankees will make the baseball playoffs.  I realize i'm going way out on a limb here with this one.   Mmmmm money, is there anything it can't do?!?   Well, i'm bored, and even though there are a billion little blurbs i could type here, i need a smoke.  I outta here ~Sizobonana

      Hey i've been away from the 'puter for a few days, but i'm back for a couple of minutes to update everyone on what has been happening in my life the past few days!   nothing   Well now that has been taken care of.  But seriously, it's a fuckin' beautiful day here in Moncton.  I imagine it's about 22 degrees out there, and blue sky.  Finally.  Hope everyone enjoys the two weeks of summer we have here beside the chocolate river.  Have you ever looked out at the banks of Hall's Creek and imagined that cracked slimy muck to be chocolate?  If you have no life like i do, then of course you have!  I don't know if it will come across in print, but i am in an unusual mood today.  Bored, yet excited.  Happy, yet pensive.  Sober, yet... well i  am  sober, so that's too bad.   I actually expect to hear back from ExxonMobil this week so this weekend i may be a little inebriated from celebrating!   I finally finished reading  The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla .  I started in on  The Talisman , but found it to be slow pacing in the first 25 pages, so i may venture downstairs  (I'm at the library right now)  and pick up something else to read.  Venturing into the children's section to locate the fifth installment of the Harry Potter adventures should sufficiently make me feel uneasy, not to mention creep out half of the children there.  I have to run over to  Krystal Blade Tattoos  and get an estimate on retouching my tattoo.  When i finally get my own computer i'll be able to post more photos on here, and this would have been an excellent spot to showcase my inkwork, but i suck and have no computer.  So just use your imagination if you haven't seen it.  It's a black sillouetted image of a girl, on her knees, back showing, head bent down in a cascade of jet black hair, and wrists tied with rope behind her back.  Seriously though, i'm just kidding.  What kind of a masochist would have something like that permanently inked on their arm?!? It's not rope, it's handcuffs.  Well all I would like to thank everyone for their comments, especially to Roy for including my blog addy on his blog   http://roymacho.blogspot.com/  , and to the anonymous comment from someone... hmmm... if i had a motorgoat for everytime i have heard that one.  Election Day in Canada.  I think i'll get over to vote in a couple hours, although in all honesty i haven't really decided who to vote for.  There isn't much to pick from in 2004. The Americans usually have better election campaigns.* ~Do svidanja  * personally i'm anti-bush.  meow.  nothing?!?  inside joke.

      Hello  (insert your name here) .  I am not really in a creative mood today, so i doubt anything i type in the next few lines will be awe-inspiring.  Today i spent a couple hours reading  The Dark Tower V: Wolves of The Calla .  With this book, i'm approaching the best part of a novel (and those of you who read any significant amount will know this), getting ever closer to the climactic scenes...  the end is in sight .  Of course, with this book the next thing that is  in sight  is  The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah .  I haven't purchased it yet... but i will soon.  Thank you Stephen King for killing my boredom today (and sooo many other days!).  Other than that nothing really to report.  Still waiting on word from Exxon-Mobil.    I watched  Red Dragon  last night for the first time.  I would give it 4.5 stars.  Great movie, and of course i won't spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen it.  However, if you liked Silence of the Lambs and/or Hannibal and haven't yet seen this one, do it.  ~A la prochaine

      It's Monday.  One week since my battery of interviews with ExxonMobil.  I know they may not call me until early July to let me know, but i'm still going nuts.  Just have to try and keep busy until then.  Being that there are so few Monday ~ Friday daytime hour jobs out there in this city, i really want this.  I need my weekends to recuperate from the trials of working in professional office environment.  See the movie office space for more details!   I just found out that my sister is planning a camping trip to Nova Scotia this weekend, and she wants me to go.  At first i was hesitant, not wanting to get in the way of her and her husband, kinda bein' a third wheel... but she assured me that at least one other will be going along (her co-worker, who does a great Ms Swan  See Mad TV  impersonation and should keep me laughin the whole time) so i guess i will tag along.  An added benefit to going camping, is that it will give me something to look forward to this weekend, and keep my mind off ExxonMobil  and my non-ringing cell phone .  I tried to watch Zoolander last night, but i was either going to fall asleep or kick the TV screen in cause i found it to be so stupid so i had to stop.  I guess thats about all the news for today.  Thanks to everyone who has been emailing me saying that they have read my blogstuff, but hey.. heres a not so subtle hint:    There is a comment button below the postings that you can make you're own statements on, so then other people can read how much you like my page, or hate it... or whichever...  .  Just make sure you leave your email me if you want a personal reply peeps. ~Sayonara

      I wouldn't want to be famous.  I was walking down Main Street last week, and who should i walk past but Beth Torbert.  You probably know her better by her stage name as Bif Naked.  It wasn't my first brush with fame, and probably won't be my last.  Some of my friends wanted to know why i didn't stop her to get her autograph.  My reply was pretty simple... she was with some friends, looking for someplace to have lunch, and i didn't want to bother her.  I think it was interesting to see her  (she is much prettier in person, than on television FYI ).  I mean, unless i could sit down and have lunch with her, and actually  talk  then what's the point?    Ms. Naked certainly isn't the most famous person in the world, but it must be hard for someone who is so recognized they can't even live a normal life.  I'll pass.  Authors must have it great.  No one but the hard core fans would recognize them, Stephen King a possible exception.  He also has some interesting takes on the whole fame thing.  In my line of work i have had other brushes with famous people.  I've had conversations with Norman Jewison (Oscar winning director), Carmine Appice (Legendary Rock Drummer), and Ryan Walter (Professional Hockey Player).  I've also met Matt Sorum (Drummer for Guns N' Roses).  As well i have been in the same interstate rest-stop with Bill Gates and the same gas pumps as former Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau.  But i'm glad i'm not them, having to deal with fanatics, stalkers and just plain weirdos all the time.  By the way, Ms. Torbert, if you're reading this, can I have your autograph?

      i just watched the movie  Daredevil  for like the 3rd time.  OK i still get fucked up when Kevin Smith makes his appearance as the coroner.  A little distracting... i'm like  "HEY! You aren't supposed to talk! You're Silent Bob!!!"  Anyhow, my sister and i laughed all the way thru it 'cause some of the special effects were a little cheesy... uhm, ok a  LOT  cheesy, but i still love it.  (Not cheesies, i hate cheesies!)  Yeah, so... i was impressed by the music and the dark imagery in the film, but i still think  The Crow  had that covered 10x over. Evanescence was a good choice for the soundtrack ~ i didn't even remember 'My Immortal' being in the film!  Everytime i hear that song i think i love it a little more.  I would have to give the movie 2.5 stars for regular movie goers, and 4 for fans of the comicbook to cinema genre, of which i am one.  At least Jason Mewes didn't pop up in a scene outside the cafe, singing his blunt song and trying to sell Electra a dime bag. ~ snoochie booches!   hmmmmmm Stan Lee... Brandon Lee... Jason Lee... Amy Lee... conspiracy?

      I was just listening to Eminem's  Lose Yourself  and thinking, as i'm always doing.  Hmmm... find something in life that you love and  do it .  We only get one shot on this rock, so make the most of every moment.    I think that having something that drives you, a true passion, is a gift and you should pursue it.  If you're not sure what it is, perhaps still searching, here's a suggestion.  Make a list of things you want to do before you die.    On searching the net I found that some people have very different ideas of things they want to do in their life.  Skydiving, bungee jumping, and rafting are common place, but I found one girl who wanted to do one good anonymous deed every day.  Someone wants to take a homeless person out for lunch someday.  One guy even said he wants to meet Jimi Hendrix.  Good luck pal, haha.  I'm still working on mine, and watch for it on here soon.  Something like  "100 Things I Wanna Do Before I Die." , if i can think of that many. At least it gives you a purpose or something to shoot for.  Goals are huge cause they are quantifiable, allowing us to see accomplishments, and making us feel like we're making a difference.  Whatever it is, don't lose your focus.  Sure we all have our down times, and one of you reading this may see no purpose in their life whatsoever.  Just a hint, if you are at a point where you don't see one, or don't even wanna go on, listen to Good Charlotte's  Hold On  (Better yet watch the video for it).  There are people that love you, and will never be the same without you  whether u know it or not! .  No matter how low you are, there's always a time when you'll bounce back.  Take it from someone who was there this past winter with no hope and seriously contemplating an early exit.  Find it... it's there.  Email me if youre lost and lets chat.  I'm always a good listener, and if you cared enough to read this, then i care enough to be there for you.  ~au revoir

      So did you ever see that episode of the simpsons where Bart falls in love with this girl named Laura?  the scene went something like this ~    Bart and Laura are in his treehouse, unbeknownst to him she is about to tell him about a new boy she is dating...   Laura:   I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone.  I have a boyfriend.   (The scene blurs into Bart's fantasy.  Laura casually reaches into Bart's chest and pulls out his heart.)   Laura:   You won't be needing this!   Laura drop kicks Bart's heart into a wastebasket.   I was just thinking about that scene and wondering who out there is going through this very thing right now.  It sucks doesnt it?  The beauty of life's emotions, flips around into the cruelness of some people's insensitivities.  I've been there.  You probably have been there ~ that person who you have a crush on or are even in love with drops a bomb on you like that.    Well the good thing about it all is everything makes us stronger and helps us grow... but especially the shit in life.  When things become a clusterfuck of emotions, it shows us just how much we can handle and what were able to overcome.  I was asked yesterday what i thought of my past relationships... and i had to think deeply.  The first thing that came to mind is that they all ended for different reasons.  Sometimes it was me and sometimes it was her.  Some were bad breakups and some were mutual and one was even some whore that cheated on me.  Well then i thought about it more carefully, and realized how much i learned from each and every one of these girls  (some would correct me and say 'women', but for simplicity sake...uh who cares)  and especially the bad relationships and the hellish endings some of them had. Those experiences i wouldnt trade for anything - i wouldnt want to go through them again, but nevertheless, i'm thankful for the experiences ~ all of them  The Good, The Bad and The Ugly  and especially the bad cause thats where we grow more as mature humans.

      Hey first entry.  Life is constant change and growth, intermixed with brief periods of boredom.  Single life has its good points, but i think i'm ready 4 the non-single time now.  ExxonMobil is supposed 2 contact me within 2 weeks regarding my interviews (three of them!) this past Monday.  I guess I'll sign out now and wait until i have something interesting to say ~ ciao

      I received a call yesterday telling me that i have been hired at ICT, a contact centre here in Riverview.  After three months and 60 plus resumes, several interviews and a worn out pair of shoes, i am employed again.  I can't tell you what a good feeling that is.  I am off to the Miramichi again, this time for four days relaxation before coming back to Moncton to begin my new job.  I am looking forward to it as a step in a career path that can lead me to financial freedom to start writing.  It is hard to put down words of fiction when your stomach is growling, so this should be a good boost.  This was short, but I am about to leave so I will have more to say over the next four days.  My parent's house is an isolated getaway that inspires thought.   ~Ciao

      I shall try to be more  upbeat  today.&nbsp; Not that I would begin to presume that anyone is actually reading this anyway, but just in that odd chance someone is (otherwise i appear to be typing to myself, which is  entirely  possible!)&nbsp; Hopefully if I am more positive in tone, you can leave with a feeling of anything other than 'holy shit, this guy needs some severe therapy.&nbsp; Or medication.&nbsp; Or some prescibed combination of the two.   Age old argument solved...     If a tree falls in the forest,     and no one is there to hear it,    &nbsp;does it make a sound?!?

      It is sometime after 2 on Monday afternoon.&nbsp; I made it back to Moncton at midnight on Friday, the same day as my interviews at Irving Oil.  At this&nbsp;moment i do not have a very good feeling about it, although the interviews and testing seemed to go well i am&nbsp;nervous.&nbsp; I just want my damn cell phone to ring... with HR from Irving on the other end... and a statement in the vein of "yes, we would like you to join our team".&nbsp; It has been a long three months without work, and I am exhausted.&nbsp; I am sick of not having any money.&nbsp; I am sick of not having a car.&nbsp; I am sick of not having&nbsp;a place of my own.&nbsp; I am sick of not having a life.&nbsp; All this ranting will not make the phone ring any faster, but it makes me feel better just&nbsp;to get it&nbsp;down on&nbsp;(pseudo) paper.  I need something to come along and rescue me... i feel like i have paid my dues and waited long enough for something good to come along.&nbsp; If they do call, i'll feel like a 22 year old&nbsp;straight out of university.&nbsp; All the possibilities ahead of me for a fresh beginning.&nbsp; Then I can start  really  paying dues - the one's with a rewarding return at the other end.  I decided to pick up a new book at the library today -  urlLink Stephen King's   Bag of Bones.&nbsp;  I may read this one before going back to the other ones i had started.  Watched the movie  urlLink Uptown Girls  last night.&nbsp; I really liked it... let's say 4 stars out of 5.&nbsp; Even though there were predictable&nbsp;plot developments and it is a little overly sentimental.&nbsp; The acting was enough to save this movie and Brittany Murphy will win an Oscar someday.&nbsp; I said it here first!&nbsp; Of course i thought that would happen ever since i saw her in  urlLink Clueless &nbsp;almost ten years ago.&nbsp; Hey, I was right about Marisa Tomei!  Speaking of celebrities, and  urlLink Brittany Murphy  specifically, i think if i could have&nbsp;a night out with one it would have to be her.&nbsp; Aside from the fact that i think she is one of the&nbsp;most attractive females on the planet, i believe she would have to be&nbsp;fun to hang out with.&nbsp; She has the nickname crackbaby for a reason.&nbsp; I would love to know what the real person is like,&nbsp;not the on screen famous actress.&nbsp; Personally i think Ashton Kutcher is an idiot for not holding onto her - i mean, c'mon?&nbsp;  Demi Moore !?!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheesh.  Well they just gave me back my card here at the library so that's my cue to exit.&nbsp; It sucks only having one hour, especially when the person before you stayed an extra 5 minutes!  remember you read the headline here first:  Brittany Murphy will win an Academy Award for acting.&nbsp; ~ giggle giggle 'snort'

      Insert cliche here >What a difference a day makes.   After finishing my rant yesterday, i strolled up to HRDC to continue my career search.&nbsp; I was only there for a couple of minutes when my cell rang, and it was  urlLink  Irving Oil Limited   calling.&nbsp; I got an interview slated for the next day ( today ) and changed the whole way i felt.&nbsp; I didn't get too excited - I had too much to figure out logistically to get overly thrilled at the time.&nbsp; How was I going to get to Saint John for the interview ( they scheduled it for 8:30 am),&nbsp; and how would i get home again?&nbsp; Would I have to hitch down andor back?&nbsp; Where would I stay&nbsp; ( is the bus shelter dry enough to crash in )?&nbsp; That annoying hampster in my brain wouldn't give his wheel a rest!    &nbsp;I want to thank Sue ( sister ) and Trav ( brother-in-law ) for dropping everything and driving me down here to the  urlLink  Port City  .&nbsp; Equally, I want to say thank you to Megan and her family for letting me stay at their place, and driving me home again!    After I stopped my brain from over-thinking itself to death, I was able to prepare for the interview.&nbsp; I arrived in Saint John last night and the fog that greeted me provided a welcoming coolness.&nbsp; Moncton has been like a sauna this&nbsp;week.   I went in for my interview this morning at 8:15, and it went very well.&nbsp; That interview then became a second interview.&nbsp; Then there was testing and forms to fill out.&nbsp; I was supposed to be there for a couple of hours.&nbsp; I walked out of the  Golden Ball  building at somtime after noon.&nbsp; I still hadn't eaten anything, and was dying for a smoke!&nbsp; I do not want to venture a guess as to what my odds are of being hired, so i will just say it's 50/50.&nbsp; How's that for being decisive?&nbsp; After the ExxonMobil position falling through, I'll leave the forcasting to the 1-900 psychic lines.   I'll be heading back home sometime today,  or tonight - &nbsp;whenever Megan takes me.&nbsp; As I go, I will&nbsp;wonder if it will be my last week to live in Moncton for a long time.&nbsp; That's cool with me if it is.&nbsp; Not being able to speak french has been a real handicap.&nbsp; Not to make excuses, but sometimes I feel like filling that out as a visible handicap on application forms!   So needless to say, my spirits are higher today than they were 24 hours ago.   If Irving Oil calls me back with an offer, there will be a case of  urlLink  Moosehead   with my name all over it!   I watched a movie last night, Monster, with Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.&nbsp; Excellent flick, give it&nbsp;3.5 out of 5 stars.&nbsp; If I hadn't been falling asleep during the last part of it&nbsp;( i was exhausted, not because the movie was dull ), I might have given it more.  Crossing over to&nbsp;the written word, I picked up a copy of Henry Miller's ' Sexus ' at the local library.&nbsp; It is really interesting ~ kinda an autobiographically inpired bit of&nbsp;writing, moving at a quick pace and definetly controversial in it's day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~later, yous guys

      Today did not start out that well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt like things were crashing in around me.&nbsp;  No, that's not accurate. &nbsp; I felt like i am set adrift in space, lost from my ship and no tether to pull me back in.&nbsp; Not dead, but not really alive.&nbsp; Simply existing and floating waiting for something good to come along and rescue me.&nbsp; Anything.&nbsp; There's gotta be enough  space junk  out there to bump into something eventually.  I got a rejection letter from ExxonMobil on Monday.&nbsp; It was the first thing i saw upon arriving back in Riverview from my two day mini-vacation on the Miramichi.&nbsp; I suppose it upset me a little, although i already knew i hadn't got the job.&nbsp; Monday was a week from the starting date, so i knew before i got the letter that it wasn't mine.&nbsp; It is frustrating because in pursuing a position with them i got a $30 parking ticket, paid $20 for passport photos which i no longer need, and spent 3 solid days of preparation for the interview.&nbsp; I researched the company until my eyes hurt.&nbsp; Leaving the interviews, i knew i had nailed it.&nbsp; I gave it a 95% chance of being hired.&nbsp; I have  never  left an interview with that much of a positive before, and now the chance of getting the job is o%.  I don't mean to sound negative ~ i'm only stating how i feel.&nbsp; To tell it like it is,&nbsp; I am frustrated.&nbsp; This morning on the way in town for yet another stop at the HRDC offices, my sister could sense my bad mood.&nbsp; I did my damndest to keep it from anyone, but i guess it rubbed off.&nbsp; My sister and brother-in-law are letting me stay with them right now, until i find a job.&nbsp; I hate the thought that i am in the way, or in this case causing her mood to slip too. &nbsp;I can only stay there until the end of next week, and i am feeling the pressure.&nbsp; When i lose my place to stay, i also lose my social assistance cheque and a place to recharge my cell phone.&nbsp; Not to mention food, which is kinda even more important and base than the former two items.  Here is a sense of my frustration:&nbsp; I am 35 years old.&nbsp; I should be at work right now, looking forward to coming home tonight-&nbsp; to my home -&nbsp; to watch the ball game or spend time with my kids.&nbsp; Driving home in  my  car.&nbsp; Home to  my  family.&nbsp; But that isn't the way life worked out for me.&nbsp; I am unemployed, living in a single room (at least for one more week), with no vehicle and no income (saved for the minimal pittance thrown me each month by Family and Community Services).&nbsp; To say I am frustrated may be putting it weak.&nbsp; I am emotionally, physically, and&nbsp;spiritually spent.&nbsp; Tired of waiting for my phone to ring with that ray of hope.&nbsp; An interview.&nbsp; A job.&nbsp; Anything.&nbsp; I know i am in the position i am in because of several factors.&nbsp; A couple are things i have done.&nbsp; A couple are circumstantial.&nbsp; And a couple are because of others.&nbsp; I am not placing blame, because regardless of where i am now, it is only me that is going to lift myself out of it.  Again, i know this sounds negative.&nbsp; It is also reality.&nbsp; I'm allowed to say whatever the hell i want to on here, due to the fact that it is my page.&nbsp; But i don't want to bring other people down with me.&nbsp; Just smile and move on!  Irving called me for a position on Tuesday.&nbsp; I only found out when i checked my messages on my cell phone, and i have since called them back three times and left messages in return.&nbsp; Phone tag sucks, and they haven't called me back yet.  The space junk analogy i used earlier is pretty obscure, but i liken it to how many resumes i have sent out since i arrived here in May.&nbsp;  Eventually one of them has to draw a job, doesn't it?!? &nbsp;&nbsp;I am getting really tired of seeing the inside of Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC).&nbsp; It's the place i have been going to send off resume's and scan the papers and job sites during my current job search.&nbsp; I will be glad to kiss that place goodbye.  Alright, now that i have&nbsp;vented i feel a little better.&nbsp; I know that things always turn out alright and that thinking negatively or worrying don't do any good.&nbsp; Just the same, it doesn't mean i can't have a&nbsp;bad day.&nbsp; I received an email this morning from my friend&nbsp; urlLink Paula , and it couldn't have had any better timing.&nbsp; I have reprinted it here ( the found the name in the story&nbsp;ironic ):  ______________________________________________   Subject: READ THIS CAREFULLY, LET IT SINK IN!!!&nbsp;    Michael is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good mood and always has something positive to say.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  When someone would ask him how he was doing, would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!"    &nbsp;  He was a natural motivator.&nbsp;    If an employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.     Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Michael and asked him, "I don't get it! You can't be a positive person all of the time. How do you do it?"     Michael replied, "Each morning I wake up and say to myself, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or...you can choose to be in a bad mood. I choose to be in a good mood.&nbsp; Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or... I can choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every&nbsp;time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or... I can point out the positive side of life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the positive side of life."&nbsp;    &nbsp;  "Yeah, right, it's not that easy," I protested.     Yes, it is," Michael said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your choice how you live your life."&nbsp;    &nbsp;  I reflected on what Michael said. Soon thereafter, I left the Tower Industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it.     Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a serious accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower.&nbsp;&nbsp;After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Michael was released from the hospital with rods placed in his back.     I saw Michael about six months after the accident. When I asked him how he was, he replied. "If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna see my scars?"     I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone through his mind as the accident took place.     The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my soon to be born daughter," Michael replied. "Then, as I lay on the ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or ... I could choose to die. I chose to live."     Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?" I asked.     Michael continued, "...the paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. In their eyes, I read "he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take action."     What did you do?" I asked.     "Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me," said Michael. "She asked if I was allergic to anything.     "'Yes', I replied. The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, 'Gravity.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Over their laughter, I told them, 'I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead.'"     Michael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully.     Attitude, after all, is everything.     "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday".  _____________________________________________  Thanks Paula... i needed that little message.&nbsp; I'll try to use it today.&nbsp; Hopefully tomorrow i will have something a little more cheery to blog about.&nbsp; Time for a smoke.&nbsp; ~l8r

      Another day another dollar.&nbsp; Well another day, another day spent looking for a job to earn that dollar.&nbsp; It's Tuesday. &nbsp; I have finally finished reading Lady Chatterley's Lover.&nbsp; D.H. Lawrence seems a little bitter about the industrialization of society.&nbsp; I wonder what he would have thought of word processors replacing the pen.&nbsp; I'll have to head downstairs soon (i'm at the library) and find a new book. &nbsp; Also, I&nbsp;caught a couple movies recently i thought i would mention and give my opinions on. &nbsp;  Cold Mountain    ~   It is a good movie (oscar nominations) but i think it was a little cliche and overly sentimental.&nbsp; Renée&nbsp;Zellweger stole the best lines in the movie. &nbsp;  Rat Race &nbsp;~ Funny moments.&nbsp; Good time movie... check it out if you want a few laughs.&nbsp; The scene at the World War II veterans banquet is hilarious. &nbsp; I saw the&nbsp;German film&nbsp;  Lola Rennt!   the other day ( English title Run Lola, Run).&nbsp;  It has a really cool concept.&nbsp; The main character is played by&nbsp;actress Franka Potente (The Bourne Identity), and  runs  through scenarios of what happens in&nbsp;her life (and those of others)&nbsp;when one second is lost, or when a decision is slighly altered.&nbsp; It's a movie that makes you think. &nbsp; It kinda has a 'Groundhog Day' feel to it, but it is not nearly as repetitive (not to mention&nbsp;Ms. Potente is way cuter than Bill Murray doing his bucktoothed Groundhog immitation.) &nbsp; It caused me to think about how small decisions can affect the complete outcome of our lives.&nbsp; I'm certain most scenarios would not change lives.&nbsp; If you go to Burger King, there probably won't be any noticeable difference if you choose&nbsp;a Whopper combo instead of a Chicken Sandwich combo. (Of course there was that one time i got food poisoning - shoulda had the salad!)&nbsp;  &nbsp; Here is a situation:&nbsp; While looking up&nbsp;at the lighted menu board, you take a couple seconds longer to decide, and a&nbsp;person opens another cash.&nbsp; She waits on you first, and she mentions that you look an awful lot like someone she knows.&nbsp; A conversation ensues.&nbsp; There is a connection.&nbsp; The a glint of a spark.&nbsp; You ask her to dinner&nbsp;(anywhere but Burger King, chump) and a relationship begins.&nbsp; You fall in love.&nbsp; Marriage.&nbsp; Kids.&nbsp; Grandchildren.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; All because you took a couple seconds longer to decide that you wanted the Junior Whopper instead of the Whopper, and got bumped to another register. &nbsp; Or maybe&nbsp;you're at&nbsp;the grocery store:&nbsp; You find yourself behind an elderly lady&nbsp;fumbling&nbsp;through her changepurse, digging out pennies.&nbsp; That's 30 seconds of your life you will never get back! &nbsp; You pass the time looking around, reading the headlines on the gossip rags, noticing a crane outside-lifting a new air conditioning unit onto the roof. &nbsp; Finally being waited on, you head towards the door, and a in a thundering crash you see that air conditioning unit smashing into the ground, just outside the exit you would have been through.&nbsp; If it weren't for the sweet old lady having to give exact change!&nbsp; (of course,  she  might now be under that rubble?) &nbsp; Of course it's a lot easier to see these things and their outcomes from a future vantage point.&nbsp; Ya' can't go through your life thinking about 'well, if i do this, then this happens, but then she will say this, and then i can't do that, and then...  Tylenol, anyone ? &nbsp; Still cool to think about, how one little decision or lost minute once upon a time put us where we are today, in one way or another.&nbsp; But i digress, back to the movie.&nbsp; Check it out.&nbsp; It rocks.&nbsp; And Franka Potente is hot.&nbsp; But the movie  itself  is good though.&nbsp; seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;besides it's hard to check her out&nbsp;with all those damn subtitles.&nbsp;~ auf wiedersehen

      hey y'all what's up?&nbsp; i have&nbsp; a new poll on here, starting today.&nbsp; A little more humor is injected into this one, so i hope you enjoy it.&nbsp; I'll leave it up for a while, but  make sure you vote .&nbsp; Hey they have a new template on here for writing my blogs.&nbsp; Awesome.&nbsp; Thanks guys and gals.  &nbsp;  I got a comment on my letter from yesterday.&nbsp; I do realize it's personal, and i posted it on the net.&nbsp; Why did i do that?&nbsp; To clear my conscience i guess.&nbsp; It's how i was feeling, and this is my journal.&nbsp; So that's that.&nbsp; If anyone has any comments i would love to hear them.&nbsp; And i respond to them all.  &nbsp;  Heading off to Miramichi for the weekend.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know, it is about 2 hours north of Moncton.&nbsp; My parents live there, but only mom will be home.&nbsp; Dad is off to Oxford, ME for the 31st Annual Banknorth Oxford 250 at Oxford Plains Speedway.&nbsp; I really wish i could go, but having no $$$ that is so totally not happening.&nbsp; They usually have around 100 stock cars that show up to try and qualify for this event.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oxford has many memories for me, but there is one moment in time i will never forget.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;at the beginning of the 1999 version of the race.&nbsp; They qualified 46 cars for the main event. &nbsp;Watching them come out of turn 3-4 in an acceleration of&nbsp;pistons and heartbeats, a roar so deafening you could scream and not be heard, and a green piece of fabric unfurled from the flagman.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chills literally ran up and down my back. &nbsp; Another memory... walking up the paved ramp to the grandstand section.&nbsp; Seeing the first cars out on the track for practice at 10 am.&nbsp; Smelling the spent racecar fuel.&nbsp; Wondering if one of the cars you were watching would be crossing the finish line first 12 hours later.&nbsp; The "250" is a big deal in racing circles.&nbsp; A lot ( most ) professional drivers have competed at Oxford.&nbsp; From Richard Petty to Jeff Gordon. &nbsp;From Bobby Allison to Matt Kenseth.&nbsp; I saw Geoff Bodine win with a last lap pass of the late Butch Lindley&nbsp;when he ran out of gas the final time into turn one.&nbsp;Or Dave Dion going around the outside of Joey Kourafas (blocked in traffic on the backstretch) on the last lap to win.&nbsp; Or Rickey Craven winning in 1991.&nbsp; I don't recall him being as excited when he won his first Winston Cup race  (well, maybe a little more emotional).&nbsp;    &nbsp; And of course&nbsp;Nova Scotia's Scott Fraser.&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting lapped by the field, he&nbsp;passed nearly every car  twice  to work his way up to a podium finish of third.&nbsp; Watching him master that heavy traffic in tight conditions reminded me of watching his father race twenty years earlier.&nbsp; Scott died in a snowmobile accident this past winter.&nbsp; He will be missed. &nbsp;&nbsp; Switching gears (hehe), my sister wanted me to advertise the fact that she is a hairstylist now, and would like to offer her services to anyone reading this.&nbsp; I informed her that people are reading this from all over the world, and it would be a long commute for a trim from Sydney, Australia.&nbsp; Annalese, if you're ever in Canada, my sister will give you a cut, dye, trim, shampoo, blow dry... whatever it is they do in those places, k' Scorchy?&nbsp; &nbsp; That should satisfy my sister.&nbsp; Of course she has her own blog so she can do her own advertising from now on.  &nbsp;  Well it's that time again.&nbsp; Time to grab a smoke and head outta here.&nbsp; Have a good weekend! ~G'Day

        i'm sorry that i hurt you  it's something i must live with everyday  and all the pain i put you through  i wish that i could take it all away  and be the one who catches all your tears  thats why i need you to hear...  Thanks to Hoobastank for those lyrics.  they couldn't be any more appropriate.  I was going through a brief pause of regret last night, specifically about hurting someone once.  And i wanted to clear my conscience and wrote her a letter.  I figured i would reprint it here, since this is an online journal and this is about as honest as i can be with myself ~   Alice,  A part of me wonders why the hell i'm writing this.  Another part of me wonders if i do write it, will i even send it to you?  And still a third part wonders, if i  do  write it and i  do  send it, will you even give a shit about anything i have to say?  How will you react?  Will you laugh out loud?  Hit the delete button before reading it all  or any of it ?  Or sit with mouth open in an  'oh my fuck'  expression (wondering what kind of wonderful new drug this guy is on, and better still, where can  I  get some?!?)?  Why do i care what reaction you will have?  Because i do.  I care.  And before you hit that ever tempting delete button in your inbox, please read on and hopefully understand  why  i care what you think.  I was outside on the deck last night, having a smoke and a coffee ~ old habits die hard,  same old michael  (not really the same though, and i'll explain that later).  Looking up at the stars i thought back to a night last spring, and a memory of...   ... the roof of a tool shed, along side the beach of seal cove.  Under a black canvas dotted with a thousand pinprick stars.  The sound of the waves ebbing in, rolling up the beach, and breaking.  One of us talking, the other listening, and then reversed.  Sharing with each other what we were dealing with in our own lives.  Separated by years but united by emotions.  You were so cold, as i remember, holding you through the tears and feeling you shaking (I think i was holding you as much to stop that damned shivering as to comfort).   and another memory   the time i first met you, at Irene's house near St. Stephen.  Something drew my interest in you that day, though i didn't know what or who you even were... only that i wanted to know.   I remembered walking with you on the beach.  Talking with you on the boat crossing Fundy.  And how everytime you were around i felt a little better.  Happier.  More alive.   ~I know this may all sound strange or even silly to you, and it does a little for me to tell it, but at least it's honesty and thats all i can give.~   And then my memory flushes dark with the clouds of my betrayal.  I'm sorry.  Much as i told you off last year, giving you the email equivalent of a  Fuck You , i am sorry...  ...and i miss you.  I don't say that lightly.  I've had many people come into, and then as quickly out of, my life.  And a good percentage of them i wouldn't look back on with a seconds thought or give a rat's ass about where they are or what they are doing.  But for some reason (fucked if i know it) i do miss you.  I think back to how we were becoming friends. A blossoming friendship.  I think how you were someone i could really  talk  to about stuff.  Someone who cared.  And more importantly someone who i wanted to listen to, to be let inside and know everything.  To know you better and to be there for you.  And again, i think about the time i betrayed the trust of someone i cared about, and it haunts me.  I could sit here and say to myself  'i don't give a shit what she thinks anyhow... just another dumb girl who doesn't care so get over it man, and move on.'   i could say that.  But it would be a lie.  I don't see you that way and i never did.  When i think about you i see someone with so much possibility, and inner strength.  A young interesting soul with so much inside.  Someone who has dealt with a lot and has had the will to get past it and deal with it.  With a maturity and intelligence beyond her years.  Someone as beautiful inside as she is out.  Someone i miss being a part of my life, whatever role that might be.  When i think of how i hurt you and betrayed your trust, i remember vividly the moment i did it.  How the words that should have remained locked in my soul and heart, instead slipped past my foolish mouth.  And how within a matter of seconds i realized i had betrayed you. I felt sick.  I felt regret.  Regret - a short word, long on consequences.  Why did i do it?  Why did i allow our words spoken in confidence to slip away on other ears?  I can't answer the why.  There was no excuse for it, and it was a mistake and it was wrong.  I can only hope that you might forgive me.   That person who betrayed you is gone, whoever he was.  I was a lost person then, not liking myself much and living an existence i hated.  I don't know who i was then.  I doubt you ever caught a glimpse of the  real  Michael.  I wished you had've, you might of liked him.  Since i extracted myself from  "that island" , i have begun to rediscover who i am.  Emotionally, Physically, Spiritually, and Mentally, i am a new person.  Sometimes i almost feel 19 again.  Not even the old 19 i was once, but a new better more mature version of it.  Just beginning to grow new and experience the beautiful things in life.  Beautiful things, and people, like you.  Then that long reaching arm of regret grabs me, and i think of when i hurt someone.  Someone i was beginning to care about quite deeply.  You may not give a flying fuck on tuesday about any of this.  Any of what i said or how i feel.  But know this.  I am sorry  I do miss you  And if you're ever bored, lonely, sad, happy, angry, whatever, and need someone to vent to, there's a guy here who would like to see you again, or at least hear from you.  ~Michael   How's that for baring my soul for the whole world to see?  Think before you speak.    Speech flows out quickly, but there lingers a bitter taste on the tongue.

      I was told to come clean re: the poll that i have on here, regarding who is your favorite canadian entertainer.  While it is true the Avril Lavigne has 5 votes, they are all from yours truly.  I never specified that you couldn't vote more than once. (I believe it will let you vote once a day)  So, that being said, i will be changing the poll on my site over the next couple days, assuming i can think of something interesting to ask.  I would do it now, but i have only 20 minutes left here, and i have to run.  In votes on the poll, eliminating mine, it looks like Mike Myers wins as best canadian entertainer.  No argument here, due to his Austin Powers muti-million dollar franchise.  I don't think i have ever laughed so hard (until it hurt) like i did watching Goldmember.  But allow me to still think of him as Wayne Campbell. ~party on wayne party on garth.

      Hot enough fo ya'? It brings to mind a line from  Good Morning Vietnam  when Robin Williams said it was so hot out he saw a little man in an orange robe burst into flames.   Well i'm sure there was far more political humor in that line than just a weather report.   Nonetheless, it is really hot out there.  When i was on the bus i felt like i was in a blast furnace.  The first bus was air conditioned, but when i transferred... well let's just say that i lost about 5 pounds in water.  I've had my day's trip to the sauna.  So here it is another week, Tuesday actually, and i am heading back out in a few minutes to continue my job search.  I will call this  Phase II  of the search.  I'm not totally giving up on ExxonMobil, because they are still sticking job ads up on the web site all the time.  I just wish that damn cell phone of mine would ring.  What am i paying for it for, if no one is calling me?!?  My friend Paula has a blog.  Check her out at http://jaded313.blogspot.com.  It's a very girly looking blog, but then again it should be 'cause the last time i looked, Paula was a very cute female.  you're welcome P, but what's with that spiderman fetish... eww .  Hmmmm... books read since my last post ~ i finished   'Salem's Lot  , re-read Stephen King's   On Writing  , and im about half way thru   Lady Chatterley's Lover  .  My favorite song of the day would have to be Linkin Park's Breaking the Habit.  I saw the video today and it is awesome.  I love the mix of computer animation and anime.  Sweet.  Well i must leave the air conditioned comfort of the Moncton Public Library, because i have real work to do today.  ~later

      i got on the bus today and had to stand up.  every seat was occupied.  maybe not such an odd occurance in some place like Toronto, but here in Moncton it doesn't happen very often.  The bus ride was loud.  You see, all of the seats were taken by five year olds, obviously on there way to some form of summer day care outing.  some people may have been annoyed by the boisterous outbursts and high pitched screeches.  not me.  i want two of them, or maybe even three.  do i feel my clock ticking?  sometimes.  I mean, i am 35 years old, and i would like to spend a couple of years with someone first, before bringing kids into the picture.  and then there's the little matter of fact that i'm single.  which in all its drunken no-one-to-answer-to glory, makes it tres difficult to reproduce.  but  ohhhh  hell no, i'm  not  desperate.  i'm not going to latch onto the first thing that comes along.  anyone that knows me, knows one thing.  i'm very picky.  probably too much so, considering that i don't resemble brad pitt or orlando bloom or whoever the cute-guy-of-the-month is.  but regardless.  she has to be the one in about a thousand categories, and at the same time only one category ~  my soul mate.  (made up of an immense check list of little bitty things).  It's not like i carry this list around with me, and some things are obviously more important than others, but i mean hell, why should  anyone  'settle'?!?  ~ciao

      Hey what's happening.  I was reading a short story last night and i thought it was pretty cool... here's an excerpt ~   "...lying in the dewy grass of the empty park, mid august.  the moon struck a silvery glow to each glistening blade. The boy couldn't rationalize (he tried, oh how he tried) what was happening to him, but let it alone.  things would always sort themselves as was the way of the world. worry never got you anywhere - wasn't that what was written on the plaque in Nan's kitchen those many years ago?  He folded his hands compacently behind his head and stared up at the brilliant specks dotting the black-blue universe.  he felt small and insignificant, yet he was to attempt something tomorrow that would change all that  assuming he lived through it .  if nothing else, it would leave a lasting mark on this small shitass town."   actually i probably should have gotten the author's permission to retype that huh?  it's cool, 'cause actually, i wrote it just now.  oh well... so what's the boy going to do tomorrow?  i haven't thought about that yet.  ideas come in spasms for me. good thing the hampster isn't tiring on his 'lil wheel in my noggin.  hope i have enough of an attention span at some point to come up with a good outline and write a novel(s).  I actually have this idea going on right now for at least 3 different stories.  who knows, at some point they may all merge into one.  Well i have wasted enough mental power for a couple of minutes... i think i'll head outside for a smoke. ~À la prochaine

      its about a million degrees out there.  hello and welcome to monday.   mondays suck.  unless they don't,  but this one does.  i'm  soooo  bored.   yawn   still haven't heard from ExxonMobil yet.   ring phone, ring!   I got tired of mentally trying to translate every other line in Lady Chatterley's Lover, and picked up 'Salem's Lot and started in on that instead... and now it's 80 pages and a day later.  I think i'll finish this off, then go back to D.H. Lawrence.  It's about 20 minutes past 3 on Monday afternoon and i'm hanging around the Moncton Public Library like some loser 'cause i have nothing better to do today.  I spent the weekend watching movies... mostly ones that i've seen before.  I saw the Breakfast Club for about the 20th time, but unlike the viewings on TBS, it was uncut.  Makes for a better film when they don't butcher it, in my opinion.  I need a smoke.  I think i'll head on out and have one.  ~nêstaévâhósevóomâtse

      Some people have made comments about my blog title, specifically "Come Down + Waste Away With Me". I suppose they have also wondered where I came up with it. I did not create it myself, and given that I believe plagiarism could be better defined as 'literary rape', I must give credit where it's due.  It is actually a line from a song called "Everlong" by the  urlLink Foo Fighters . It was my favorite song a couple of years back, and I found the lyrics interesting. (As well, it is 'come down  and  waste away with me', not ' plus  waste away with me'. I simply used the plus sign in place of 'and' because it allowed the title to fit nicely on one line, and I think it looks better. As for the song itself, it (in my interpretation) is about an intense love affair, and how one invites the other to throw themselves into the passion with all their soul.  Here are the lyrics reprinted.   Hello I've waited here for you Everlong

      I think I am suffering from PMS. Hold on, don't get freaked. I know I'm a guy, and that is a female condition but let me explain.  Have you ever had one of those days when you feel washed out? When you are spent physically, mentally and emotionally?  I am sooo there right now. I think it's my body's way of saying "Hey dumbass! Take a fuckin' break pal, you deserve it."  Since I wasn't working the last three months you wouldn't think that I needed a break. But i need recharging. You know those batteries - the ones you can test by placing your thumb on the top and a finger on the side, lighting up the power bar to show you how juiced up it is? Well, if I could be tested in that fashion, my power strip might show full charge for all of 2 millimetres before fading to black.  A.  'P' is for Physically Drained   It has a lot to do with my 'jet lag'. No, I haven't just flown in from someplace. Truth be told, I have  never  flown anywhere. This  lag  has been caused by having to get up at 5 am for my new job. There were so many nights this past winter and spring where if it was 5 am, I still hadn't gone to sleep yet! Quite a switch.  Yesterday, Tuesday, I was up at 5 am. I walked to work at 6:30 am. Worked until 3 pm. Walked to the library, and then home again at 4:30 pm. Played softball from 6 until quarter of nine. I was home by 9:30, but it took me until nearly midnight to unwind and fall asleep. The up at 5 am again this morning. Wash, condition, and repeat.  Playing softball was a blast. I haven't played in any form of organized game in four years. But today I have muscles aching that I could swear weren't there yesterday. (It's my belief that they just grew anew yesterday for the sole greedy purpose of making me hurt and punishing me for a few years of neglect!). The only thing that got a tougher workout than my muscles last night, was my snooze button this morning.  B.  'M' is for Mental Exhaustion   Should I give the short version or the long one? Hmmm. Fuck it, anyone that knows me, knows one thing. That my short versions are long enough to put even the most interested person to sleep so I will keep it short. (I am  so  self depreciating...)  Not working since April has been hard on my head. Hard like falling off a motorcycle going 40 mph and having aforementioned head grating across chip-sealed road. The things I have done over those few months should have driven me mad. All the resumes sent (over 60 at last count), many meetings with social services, meetings with career development, interviews and subsequent rejection letters from Irving Oil and ExxonMobil, other phone interviews, riding the bus, trodding the pavement, and making HRDC my home away from home. All the while wondering if any of it was getting me anywhere.  Sitting here now with full-time employment, I know it  was  worth it. I am glad I went through the experience, although its effects still have me, lingering like that putrid scent that freshly emptied kitchen garbage cans have (Sorry, best analogy I could think of - I'm working with refried brains here).  C.  'S'   is for Emotionally Wiped Out  oops. that doesn't fit. Hmmm... hold on I can fix it. let me see... imagination beginning to sputter to life... brain power strengthening... 'KLIK!' (cartoonish sound of lightbulb suddenly popping on over my head)  C.  'S' is for Spent Emotionally   In addition to the mental overload I have dealt with recently, there hasn't been much of a release for it. I haven't done fuck all socially since I moved here in May, saved for one party out with the boys, one party at home with the girls (my sister's co-workers mostly), and hanging around places by myself.  I can harp all I want about wanting to be single for awhile, but that's a load of bullshit. I do believe that some people can say they need alone time, or 'me' time... but that's simply not the case for me anymore. Other than a couple of very short term dating relationships, I have been single for the last year now. I think i've had enough  me time.   I am  not  desperate. Let's clear that up  right now ! Having said that, I think it sucks being alone and I am ready to meet  her.  I say 'her', and not 'someone', because i am  not  desperate. Although I am not Brad Pitt, or Orlando (or whoever the hollywood hunk o' the month is), I have had my share of interested females over the last 12 months. I have also had enough girlfriends over the last three years. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I am tired of it all, and ready to settle down. I'm not ready to rush into anything, but it would be nice to meet someone to do shit with. And none of those interested over the last while have been anyone I wanted to be with. It's not that I am picky... I think it's just that I know what I want (mostly from having what I didn't want in the past).  If I close my eyes I can see her...   She's between 5'0" and 5'6"... between 105 and 130 lbs... physically fit... she laughs at my jokes, but also isn't afraid to tell me when I'm pissing her off... she doesn't necessarily love sports, but maybe likes some of them, or at least tolerates me loving them... she is sweet, caring, loves movies with loads of popcorn, enjoys music (this is a key point, because if she was always telling me to turn that 'shit off' she wouldn't be in this vision. And of course she needs to be "a lady in public, and a whore in the sack" (thank you Mitch for that oh-so-eloquent phrase from years ago).   I guess by that last comment I just want someone who I click with on that level. Age doesn't really matter to me, but maturity does. She has to be someone who is ready for a relationship at some point (not still in love with an ex, or with severe mental issues). It's not like I'm whippin' out the rock on the second date (Been there done that not gonna do it for a long time) but just with no heavy baggage. Everyone has some, just so long as she hasn't packed her whole house for a weekend at the beach, if ya' take muh meanin'.  Above all she can't be clingy or jealous. A little bit of that goes a long way, and if she's too much so, or even worse that terrible 'C' word  (Controlling) .  Well I kinda got off topic there. (Almost started sounding like the soundtrack on a tape from a video dating service!). I guess to the point is I feel ready to meet  her,  the  one ... all that jazz. It sounds kinda simple but the waiting licks dog snot.  So here I am, spent emotionally, sore all over, and my mind feels dead.  Time to recharge those batteries. I'll be asleep by 10pm tonight. And right now I'm going outside for a cigarette. Just cause I wanna.  ~Ciao

      I started my new job yesterday.  The training goes from 7 am until 3 pm.  It was pretty difficult to get myself moving the first day... being awake at 5 am is quite foreign to me, unless it's because I have not gone to bed yet.  Friday was the day that the weird shit happened.  I had mentioned in my previous post that Irving Oil called and wanted to schedule an interview.  As it happened, i managed to find a drive to Saint John that very day.  There was a mad scramble to get ready, and a couple phone calls to Irving (I kept getting machines, but did leave a couple of messages).  However, they called me back about 2 minutes before I was about to hit the road - telling me that they had changed their minds about a third interview.  Well needless to say I was pretty upset for about 20 minutes.  A roller coaster day of emotions if I have ever had one!   Apparently, on one of the messages I had left, I informed them that I was starting my new job on Monday and I would prefer to work the interview around that.  It only made sense to me - why jeopardize a guaranteed job for one that was only a maybe,  no matter how great that job opportunity is!   So they had decided not to interview me.  I can only imagine that my message had something to do with their change of heart.  Alas, life goes on.  After the 20 minutes of being extremely pissed ( my sister took one look at me, sitting outside on her back deck, and decided to leave me alone - probably a good idea at the time ) I managed to snap out of it.  I mean, hell, that morning I woke up believing Irving had decided not to hire me.  So what of it if they called for an interview and changed their minds - nothing had changed since that morning for me.  Mentally I knew I had to prepare myself for beginning work with ICT on Monday.  And that was all that mattered.  (I did make another call to the gentleman at Irving later that evening expressing that I still wanted to work there - eventually.)  So back to the present, it is Tuesday and I have 2 days under my belt at ICT.  It seems like a good group (there are 18 of us in training) but of course we will all be split up once we hit the call floor.  The irony of it all, is that my job will consist of taking calls from a large home heating retailer.  Very similar in job description to what Irving wanted me for - at two thirds the salary.  The benefit to me ( and Irving )  is evident to me.  Down the road they will have someone who knows more about the home heating industry and is more prepared to work there.  Of course that may never happen.  If I can advance where I am now, that will have to come into consideration.  Call centres always make me nervous.  You never know what will happen to that industry, or which ones will stay put (in favor of striking out for the more budget wise placement in India or other locales).  If it was more secure and I could support a family on it, I would never leave.  With my experience and mind (some may disagree on the latter) I could make a career right where I am.  Ok, I have all that out of the way.  I don't think I have seen any new movies lately.  I did finish reading Bag of Bones, and started in on The Eyes of the Dragon.  Ironically the very book I had started the last time I worked at ICT - in 2000.  This time I have actually gotten past the first few chapters and am almost half way through.  Speaking of books, I have made some major gains in outlining my novel.  I know that some writers don't do outlines.  Fine for them... but not something I can do yet.  Still a beginner, so I will keep as many notes as needed until this project is finished.  The story is about - oh yeah, right - like, i c ould  tell you, but then i'd have to ... y'know.  I am positive that it will never pop up here on my site... too easy to cut and paste text - i'll keep it close to home for now.  Hell, it will likely be at least a couple years before I have a final draft - depending on my work demands.  Well, I'm outta here for now.  Hit up my survey if you haven't already.  Those of you that picked the ' urlLink Ron Jeremy ' choice for #10 - have you ever seen that guy?!?  I'll probably have something more interesting to talk about the next time I post.  I think today was just a vent session.

      I'm starting my new job on Monday.  Ahhh my last weekend of freedom.  Well, not exactly.  There are three weeks of training where I have to work Monday thru Friday, so I'll have at least two more weekends off - possibly three more - before the real grind comes.  I'm pretty excited about starting this new job, with the chance to get to know roughly 15 new co-workiers and start back in the work force.  I think the latter is the best part of it - the most important.  A chance to regain a spot of dignity through having gainful employment.  While I wasn't working and found myself in social situations I would always dread the inevitable question regarding what I did for a living.  And the stuttering response of "uh... uh... oh... nothing right now.... but I'm looking!"  I met a girl roughly three months ago at a party, and I had designs on getting to know her better.  And up came the dreaded words "So what do you do?".  At that moment I was checking her out, but thought that wasn't the response she wanted to hear.  Of course I had to tell her that I wasn't doing anything saved for looking for work.  I believe that killed any glimmer of opportunity to get to know her better.  Before you go saying that it doesn't really matter, there is actual fact that I base this on.   urlLink MAXIM  ( the suburban male's final and authoritative source of ultimate wisdom in understanding the fairer sex - in magazine form ) ran a survey in conjunction with  urlLink Marie Claire  ( some chick magazine - i have no idea what's inside  that  one ) where each magazine asked questions about their thoughts on the opposite sex.  The questions ran the gamate from opinions on sex, relationships, cheating, and why we are just so damn annoyed with each other all the time.  Maxim printed the results from the females surveyed in Marie Claire, and vice-versa.  So having participated in this survey I watched for the results anxiously, and found them in the July 2004 issue.  And one question/answer jumped off the page at me.  The question was phrased something like "What trait's gross you out the most (in a potential boyfriend)?"  The choices were back hair, unemployment, bad manners, tevas* with socks, snorty laugh, and google eyes.   Guess which topped the list.   Unemployment was number one.  So I figure that even if I had googly eyes, a robin williams like mat of black back hair, and snort like Suzanne Somers on Three's Company - as long as I got a job I'm good to go!  Bad manners was the girl's second choice, but I think I got that one covered.  I do feel like being single for awhile tho.  I think that's what I need.  (Everytime I say that, I end up meeting someone, so maybe It's my subconscious going Noooooooo - or something down there anyways.)  I need to concentrate on work and using this job as a springboard to another.  I still want to work for Irving Oil (or an Irving company), and ironically enough as I was typing this they actually called me.  They want me for a third interview.  Ugh.  I'm supposed to start work on Monday.  What to do what to do...?  I realize that call centre work can be routing to the point of boring, a little stressful, and not an ideal way to try to provide sustanance for a family.  That being said, I choose to see it as the chance to have a good  current  reference and a starting out point.  I can motivate myself every day before work that this is why I am doing it.  On those days when the supervisor is on my case about some stat or another, bills are stressing me out, or maybe i'm suffering from a killer headache and work is the last place I wanna be.  This job is training camp for me.  Spring training.  The beginning of bigger and better things.  Does that mean I see the perverbial glass as half full?!?  I'm like, "I've  GOT  a glass, and that's a hell of a lot more than a lot of people have!"  So yes, I am excited.  I'm not naive.  I have worked in enough contact centres to know what I am getting into - I know the drill.  I know what lies ahead and am prepared to do what I have to, to get ahead.  Bring it on.  Hand me my headset - at least I'm not asking the customer on the other end "do you want  fries  with that?"**  I'm not sure how often I will be able to post on here in the coming weeks.  Given that I don't own a computer, and I'll be in training during the same hours the library is open, it could be difficult.  I may just jot down thoughts all week and randomly post them all together at once.  Eventually I  will  own a computer of my own - and then just  try  and shut me up!  ~Ciao  *Apparently 'Tevas' are some form of sandal.  And yes ladies,  i had to look it up.  I actually thought it meant Sex... you know, having sex with your socks on.  Sox Sex.  Hehe.  Did you see  urlLink Avril Lavigne  'tongue'  urlLink Ed The Sock 's ass on the  urlLink MuchMusic  Video Awards!  Would that be considered foreplay to Sox Sex?  Send your replies to Get a Life, P O Box....  **There is nothing wrong with working a drive thru.  I worked at Mickey D's back when I had just gotten out of college - the hardest work for the least money I ever had in my life.  If you don't believe me just try unloading a truck full of french fry boxes, and then immediately work the grill during the dinner rush in July.  I wouldn't trade that experience.

      I’m sitting upstairs in my brother’s room enjoying part of my last 24 hours on the Miramichi.  This could be my last vacation for some time.  I start my new job next Monday, so it will likely be next summer before I qualify for some extended time off.  It’s sweltering up here, and my next stop will be the shower for a much deserved cooling off.  I did manage to load up some mp3’s onto his winamp, so at least I have that bit of reprieve.  Sum 41’s Fat Lip is blasting out of the desktop speakers.   I love music.  It, as much as writing, helps shut the rest of the world out.  I was watching the news earlier and saw yet more devastation happening in Iraq.  I can’t begin to imagine what it must be like for the people living there.  It’s hard to fathom car bombs going off every day in Moncton.  Shit, I wouldn’t want to leave my house.  I am thankful for having the freedom to sit here listening to Sum 41 sing about not becoming another victim of conformity and society.  I wonder what Saddam Hussein would think of it.  I will be leaving the house tonight for a couple of hours though.  I’ll get in the car, crank up the stereo, and head into Miramichi for a cruise around town.  (My parent’s house is not exactly in Miramichi, but about 5 miles out in a small community called Whitney –one of those don’t-blink-or-you’ll-miss-it communities that helps fill the rural gap between major centers).  Driving is another way I find to get away from it all.  It’s not something I can do very often, since I haven’t had a vehicle since I was married.  My Dad has been kind enough to allow me the chance to get out of here each night using his car.  It’s a Taurus station wagon, the kind of car I wouldn’t have wanted to be caught dead in when I was younger.  When you’re 35 and the car has air conditioning, you tend to be less fussy.  Cruising around Miramichi reminds me when I was younger, somewhere in my early 20’s.  I used to go out for hours on end and just kill time driving around Miramichi.  There wasn’t a whole lot else to do around here back then (I grew up in Salisbury and most of my friends were either there, Moncton or Saint John).  When I moved here in 1990 driving became my main source of entertainment.  It even led to a few interesting adventures.  I know they say you’re not supposed to pick up hitchhikers, but I have always been a bit naïve in that department – especially when said hitchhiker is a girl.  For me it comes down to just wondering what would happen to them if I don’t pick them up, and the next person behind me is a sick fuck and does pick them up.  You might be surprised how many times you will see a girl hitchhiking alone.  It scares me when I think that someday that might be my own daughter (assuming I have one).  One night, I believe it was in 1992, I came across a girl with her thumb out.  I picked her up and the typical pleasantries followed.  “Hi”, she said.  “Hi.  Where ya’ headed?”  “I’m going across the river, to the base”.  “Cool.  Cool.  I can take you there if you want”, I replied.  “I’m just out cruising around not really goin’ anywhere specific.”  “Well would you mind stopping somewhere first, then?”  I wondered what she might have in mind, and curiosity got the better of me.  “Sure, where did ya’ wanna go?”  She pointed, and said “The cemetery.  Up here on the right.”  She proceeded to tell me the story about her friend/co-worker who had died recently.  Apparently he had died as a result of a suicide attempt, and being so young it was a big blow to everyone she worked with.  I told her I’d heard about it.  After all, it was fresh news on the Miramichi , and in a small community news travels with the vigor of a twister bearing down on a trailer park.  She continued on with more details about what happened after his death.  Apparently, the staff at the fast food joint (where they worked) had wanted the owner to close the store during the funeral and put it’s flags at half-staff.  When the ownership refused to do this, they took matters into their own hands. Some one, presumably a staff member, torched the ‘M’ shaped hedge near the drive-thru.  Ironically, when they replaced the burned bushes they bricked the area over in that same ‘M’ shape, creating a more lasting monument to the guy’s memory.   We pulled into the cemetery and walked over to an area of freshly dug earth.  She and I sat there for about an hour, just talking about stuff (can’t remember what now, this was 12 years ago, afterall).  I do remember that she told me her father was in the military, and she lived on what was then Canadian Forces Base Chatham.  She looked about 19, had dark hair -shoulder length- and she was fairly attractive, sitting there on the grass with her face lit by the vague glow of streetlamps.  I couldn’t even recall her name a couple days later!  I dropped her off on the base and went home myself without even asking for her number – something I regretted almost immediately.  I have thought about that night once in awhile, over the 12 years that have passed since, wondering what ever happened to her and how her life has turned out.  Water under the bridge.  I’ll probably get out of here pretty soon, drive around and see what this night brings.  ~laters

      Is there a cool locale anywhere in New Brunswick?  And by cool i mean temperature wise, not how excellent the view is.  Miramichi is even hotter than Moncton was this past week.  It seems like it took forever for the real summer weather to get here, and then it came all at once.  I shouldn’t complain about the heat though, since last summer I spent about a solid month enveloped in the fog on Grand Manan Island.  I went driving for a couple of hours last night.  Forget penicillin, the printing press and pocket calculators.  Air conditioning is the greatest invention of mankind.   ***Disclaimer and Warning to all Females – I am going to talk about Baseball for the next several paragraphs… just skip this entry and read the next one.   Earlier in the day the suffocating heat had forced me indoors.  I melted onto the couch in the wake of an indoor fan (lesser cousin to the air conditioner invention) and flipped on the television to catch the ball game.  The game I found was between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs.  My favorite team is the Boston Red Sox, and on Friday they traded my favorite player, Nomar Garciaparra, to the Cubs.  In New England his name was pronounced No-Mah, and with great affection.  I began to reflect on how times have changed in sport and no on seems to stay on one team for very long… and how the Red Sox futility has gone back a long time.  In 1918 my Grandparents were still infants.  The world was just coming out of the ravages of the Great War (later history would label it World War I).  The Titanic disaster was still as fresh in people’s minds as 9-11 is in ours.  The roaring twenties hadn’t happened yet.  And George Herman Ruth was a still pitching for Beantown.  In September of 1918 the Boston Red Sox had just won the World Series of Baseball.  Their owner decided he needed an infusion of cash to finance his other business ventures.  He sent Babe Ruth packing to the New York Yankees for something like $100,000.  That is still a lot of money.  In 1918 it was a fortune.  The money was actually used to fund a play on Broadway in, of course, New York City.  1918…12 years before the stock market crash.  Forty-two years before John F. Kennedy was elected President.  Forty-five before he was un-elected.  Fifty years before a man walked on the moon.  And the last time the Red Sox won the World Series.  It’s called The Curse of the Bambino (one of Babe Ruth’s numerous colorful nicknames).   They haven’t won a championship since he was sold to the hated Yankees.  Hell, they sure have come close enough.  Since last winning, the Sox have lost in the 7th game of the Series on four occasions.  They were one strike away from winning it all in 1986.  One strike.  And things fell apart once again.  The most infamous incident in that horrid 6th game breakdown being the ball that got between Bill Buckner’s legs.  Never mind that he had a splendid career in the major leagues.  He will always be known as the goat that cost the Red Sox the World Series.  But I submit that if the owners are given accolades when their team wins, they should  also  be given the blame when they aren’t successful.   I watched Nomar Garciaparra play today.  I saw the crowd at Wrigley Field give him a standing ovation as he made his debut in his blue Chicago Cubs uniform.  He had a hit and an RBI in the Cubs victory. At the same time Boston played a game in Minnesota - and lost, when the player they traded for booted a ball and cost them the winning run in the bottom of the ninth.   If teams are going to continue to give up their talented and, even more importantly,  popular  players, how are they ever going to win a championship?  Curses aside, when you make dumb moves like that maybe you don’t deserve to win.  Chicago could very easily take the World Series this year, then making the Red Sox owners look even more red in the face.  But it would be nice for Chicago.   While it is true that Boston hasn’t won the World Series since 1918, Cubs fans have waited even longer - their last was in 1908!  ~Ciao
