      You can finally tell that school is almost over when we have to clean out lockers, turn in our books, and start talking about the final. I got just a week left and so excited. Amber complains about it because I don't have to take the finals I about three of my classes. Well she can get over it.  Last night no one was in the high school class, so I didn't get to play my joke on some of the people, I get them Sunday or sometime next week. I bet some stayed home to watch AI. For those who don't know what AI stands for it stands for America Idol. Fantasia won last night which a lot of people here in Nitro or just in Music App. Class thought Diana was going to win.   First block is one of the best class, our teacher just bought us some donuts holes, plus we have already taken our final so all we do in here is just get on the computer and play games was the awards assembly for the seniors which the whole school gets out of the morning class to watch. Hey, I'm not complaining since I got out of one class.

            Today was the school wide election. The people who are running for office are really desport if they are outside waving signs saying " Vote for Buel" or "Kerns for President". It is enought to make you vote for them if you know what i mean.lol:D I had to vote for my best friend Chrissy for Securtary.( she was so perk during her speech)    This year they made us vote in 1st block after the video of each person speedch was over. Last year it elections was different. Each person give a speech in front of the student body during the assembly. I told Ashley G. that she should have run for President but knowing her she would be a comm one,lol. I tell you who won the elections as soon as i can. Any ways i guess i be goning now since i have some homework to do and places to be. Bye for now

       Well, what do u know? It seems like school is nothing but drama. Who does Kate think she is? She and Jeff broke up agian and still trying to blame Jenny. She needs to grow up. Besides that, this guy im Melissa and kinda treathen her if she doesn't give him something. Plus this guy knows about every single one of us. That is one reason i came to blogspot.   I think that this is better than the live journals. well this looks like a good start. I talk to ya later... bye for now

      My friend Ashley had tryouts for Field Commander for 2004/ 2005 Band and she made it. I know she would. She been practicing so hard and it has always being her dream to be field commander since she started band. I am so proud of her because she had made one of her dreams come true. Nitro Band will be better next year b/c of her. I have to admit that our band is one of the best in West Virginia and we also have one of the best drumlines east of the Mississippi River.  Well, that all for now. Talk to ya later.  p.s.     come visit my lj if you can.

      Ok so finals are today and tomorrow and everyone is hitting the books hard. Yesterday was supposed to be the day when the teachers went over the finals with us and tell us what to study but that never happened. Nitro High was closed down yesturday after an hour of it started due to 2/3 of the school not having power and the flood on the second floor. I think it is about time that we do something about it.  Bad news is we still have to take the finals today. I hope I study for everything that will be on the test. I five minute we got to go to mentor groups and file up some more papers before going to 2nd block and taking the final. Hey, that is more study time for me at least. Any way I better get ready for this killer Final and then go find Jenny and compliant about it. Bye ya'll

      Finally I got the internet back:) I hadn't have the internet for about two months but I really didn't need it because most of the summer I was busy going trips and help with activities with the youth. During July my friend T-bear came back in town for about a week and he just got done recording a CD with his band. The group is called Entering Canaan and most of the songs on the cd was written by them. I am so happy for them and I wish them the best luck. So beside that I just got the books I have to read. The Pearl has to be on the top 10 worst book in the World list. Ever time I tried to read it I fall asleep or just put it down. School will be starting Aug. 26 I think. It always started in the middle of the week. At least I got a lil more time off than Zac. I wonder what everyone is up to now?? Well I guess I'll get off and find out . C ya later
