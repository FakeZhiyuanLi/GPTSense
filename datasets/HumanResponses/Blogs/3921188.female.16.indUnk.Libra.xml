      I'm real bored. Like... the kind of boredom where you sit around and the only thought that crosses your mind is how bored you are. You can't think of anything else, except the fact that you're bored. It takes over your mind and next thing you know - you look at the clock and it's been 3 hours and you've sat there doing nothing. Because you're bored.&nbsp; Ya know? &nbsp; So... how was my day? Hot. Guarded from 9-3 and lemme tell ya - it was a scorcher. I guess it's not that it was really that hot, but there were no clouds what so ever, so it was just pure sun poundin down on me for 6 hours. Days like these I can literally feel the&nbsp;melanoma&nbsp; growing and developing in my skin... kinda scary to think about. Ew. &nbsp; Since today was Monday, that means we got the rest of the schedule for this week... only 37 more hours now that todays 6 are over - errr. I'm getting trained in the front office tomorrow. This means now besides lifeguarding, working in the store, being adtivities director, and working in the cafe - I'll now be checking people in and answering phones and making reservations and stuff. This is big news. 16 and workin the front desk... woo-hoo. Oh... and... Monday means payday :) Guess who got a raise? Yeah... I know. I deserve a pat on the back. I just scored 40 cents more an hour. Bling Bling. &nbsp; Hmm. I can't really think of much more to talk about. My moms gone for another week in Indy for business stuff and Bruce is at a meeting tonight - so, I'm home alone. I'm actually kinda lonely :-/ ... that and I miss hangin out with Nick. No word I guess on how long hes gonna be grounded for. Suck my balls. &nbsp; Well kids, sorry to disappoint you - but I think I'm gonna end it here. I really need to take a shower or something because I smell. Literally. That, and I've been in this swimsuit for well, nearly 13 hours now. Ha... gross. &nbsp; Until later... &nbsp;- chris

      Ever wake up some mornings... and feel more tired then, than when you went to bed the previous night? Lemme explain this feeling to you... IT BLOWS. &nbsp; I worked from 8-4 today in the Cafe @ the campground. Pretty uneventful day there... although, today was Yogi's birthday (I work at a yogi bear themed campground for those of you unaware of that) and there was a massive surprise birthday party thrown at 10:00 for him. I, being the lone- brave soul in the cafe, was in charge of refreshments. I can still hear the words... "Kids... go get your cookiesssssss" and can see the herd of excited children running up to the counter. Madness. Pure madness. I had a 6 foot tall bear at my side dancing (Wendy really does enjoy getting in the Yogi costume a little  too  much) so that didn't help. Times like these I sit back and think how much my summers suck. I work at a campground thats based around a fictional bear who likes to go on picnics... I spend my days lifeguarding the 5 foot pool and my evenings calling bingo for the kids. I wake up super early on Saturday and Sunday mornings so I can go work in the store to deal with angry campers who need their morning cup of coffee, and to tap it off... I get paid a measly $6.30 an hour. Go ahead... laugh at the thought of my summer days.  &nbsp; Well... Nick's grounded, so looks like I'm at home tonight. Who's ever heard of grounding your kid for not wanting to do showmanship for his rabbit at the 4H fair? Hmm.. Amy Spitzer I guess. &nbsp; That's all for now folks. Tune back tomorrow for recap of another exciting day in the life of Christina Anderson... ha. &nbsp; - chris

      So, this is the first day all summer where I've woken up and not immediatly haven to go jump in the shower and get ready to go babysit the boys... I woke up this morning, WHEN I WANTED TO (sadly, I tried to sleep as long as possible, but I finally gave up trying to sleep and got up a little after 9). It felt great :) All morning, I've been doing what I wanted to do... instead of what a little 5 and 9 year old would want to do. I feel so... so... free!   My brother is down visiting from Michigan. He starts his new job in Illinois on Monday so he's here for the weekend with us. It reminds me of the summers when I was little... where we'd just sit around all day together and watch tv and movies and then make lunch together :) It's been fun!   I have to work tonight from 6-10 at the campground in the store. We're booked full this weekend, so it'll be crazy. It's supposed to rain tonight too, so I'll get hundreds of angry, soaking wet campers coming in bitching at me just because they forgot an extension cord, or marshmallows, or something pitiful like that.  Welcome to my world...      Hmm... I can't really think of much else to talk about at the moment. I'm just sittin on the couch watchin "I love the 90's - 1997" on VH1 and realized I hadn't blogged in awhile. Maybe I'll blog some later.. who knows. Everyone have a pleasant day :-D   -chris &nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;      &nbsp;

      Well, Victoria had her baby... yay? I guess this all went down about 5:30 this morning... guess who was @ home sleeping tho... haha - me :) And guess how much I care... haha... you got it - none :) I really, really, really don't like this stepsister of mine. Shes incompetent, rude, lazy, and above all - STUPID. Hello, you have a baby and have to put it up for adoption because you couldn't take care of it... so, lets try again with baby #2? Wtf?  Like I've mentioned before, the baby is getting adopted like... today. Kinda sad, but kinda not. It's Victoria's freakin fault for bein dumb. But, oh well... whatever the hell makes her happy.  I needa go get ready for babysitting... last freakin day! Yeahhh! :-D  Oh, almost forgot to mention... wanna hear something kinda... odd? Hmm, the baby's name is Nicholas Scott Hurley, hmm.. and guess what? I sure do know a Nicholas Scott Spitzer. Coincidence that the baby is named after my boyfriend? Wtf?  Leave me a comment or 2.. k?           -chris

      Tonight ended on such a good note :) Got some burger king with Ashlee, and lemme tell ya what... I got THE coolest spiderman stopwatch in my kids meal. I suggest you all run out to BK right NOW and go get one. You won't be sorry...  Then, outta no where, Nick and Tyler show up at my house and tell me to grab my stuff... we're goin swimmin! Yay :) Michel met up with us and us 4 went back to Tyler's and went in the pool. It was reallll cold outside, but we had alotta fun. Nick once again, beat me up :( Oh well... what a relationship! :) haha... j/k ;)  But yea, I'm strugglin to keep my eyes open and it's just a few minutes after 12... must mean I need to go to bed. Last day tomorrow... YAY :-D  Still no word on the baby situation. It's midnight and my stepdad's still not home from the hospital... my moms in Indy, so I'm home alone... hmm... I'm guessing either shes like gone into labor for real, or theres more complications (last time I heard from them there was some, I guess... who knows) The baby's getting adopted from birth... it's kind of a sad story...  Good night... you loyal readers, you           - Chris

      My day... where do I start? Wait... wait... I know where. How about at the 1:30 am wake up call I get? Hmm... yeah...   And then, speaking of calls... after I drag my butt outta bed at 6:30 AM to go babysit for the boys, and after I get a shower, eat my breakfast, and am literally grabbing my keys to walk out the door I get joyous call #2 of the morning... this time it was the boys's parents, telling me I didnt need to come to their house until 11:00 today. Once again... wtf?   I show up at 11:00, they show up at 12:00... big deal... I figured, I'm making $175 for 3 days this week... I'm not gonna complain. I think I failed to mention this, but tomorrow is my LAST day babysitting 4 them and words can't express my level of enthusiasm about this. These have been the longest, yet best paying, 7 weeks of my life. Every day was a struggle to get out of bed and know I have to go face those brats. Oh well... after tomorrow.. I'm free. Wait, scratch that... forgot about job #2. That's right... I'll become full-time out @ the campground. Errrr... I'm 16 - why the hell do I have 2 jobs?   But, things got much better when I got home. My bestest Natalie and I have devised a plan that means her, Cody, and Chris would be coming to visit me for a day or 2. :-D Major excitement about this one!! Do you realize how many times Natalie has spent the night with me in the last year, at my house? Yes.. once :( I miss her... tons. This summer and last summer have not seemed like summers at all. It can't be a summer without my Natty 2 doors down. Do you realize I grew up with that for  10 years  and what a major PAIN IN THE ASS it has been getting used to it? Some days I just wake up and want to walk down the street and be able to go see what Natalie is doing. Then, I snap back into reality and realize that it's more than a meer walk down the street... it's a 75 minute drive. I miss everyone back home, but there are certain people I just miss more than others... my girls of course, the guys of course (especially Cody... :( ) and then... Natalie. May be hard to understand, but she's been like a  sister  to me since the first day of kindergarten when I met her. I'll never forget the first time she knocked on my door and asked "So, do you wanna come to my house and play?" Yes Natalie, I'd trade anything right now to just come to your house and play :) It's so hard sometimes... especially with all the stuff that's happened this summer... but, I know shes always there for me... and that helps to bring the smile back to my face :) It's okay... someday when we get older we can do crazy stuff like marry twins and live next to each other - like we always used to pretend when we were little.   On a lighter note... the stepsister I despise, Victoria, is presently at White County Memorial Hospital... in labor. I know... ewwwww. Even the boys today when I recieved the call realized just how gross this is. The 9 year old looked up at me and said, "Dude, who would do HER?" Ha... ohhhh Adam.   Well, maybe I should go be a good step sister and visit her. On the other hand... maybe not. Maybe I should just go keep Bruce company at the hospital. Poor guy. Orrr, maybe I should go visit Ashlee at work. I like that idea...   Until later...  -Chris

      Well, well... look who's starting an online blog. Yeah, me. I've become highly addicted to reading these lately and the thought crossed me as I was just taking a shower... why don't I start my own? So, 10 minutes later... here I am. Starting my very first online blog. I'll probably use this as a place to rant mostly.... lately I find myself really pissed off and confused at the world... and with no one to listen. So, to those of you out there that choose to read this, bear with me while I whine... I'll try to not do it  all  the time ;). I'm asuming those of you out there that choose to read this probably know me fairly well... and if you don't, why the heck are you reading this? Ha... just kidding. The more the merrier! But, if you don't know me... then go ahead and take a looksy at the profile or leave some comments or somethin... k? :) Well... as much as I'd like to write more right now... I need to go finish getting ready. I'm supposed to be going to the drive-in to see hot chicks (again) with Nick... and of course, Tyler. Lately Tyler has become quite the tag-along... call me crazy, but I'd like to spend SOME along time with my boyfriend. Hmm... we'll see what happens... I'll write more later.   Missin ya as always Sammybaby... 6.27.04  - chris
