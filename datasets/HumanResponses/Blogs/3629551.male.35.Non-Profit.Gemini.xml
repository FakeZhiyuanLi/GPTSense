      Am I allowed to complain about cultural differences?  I am?  Good, thanks.  Here goes...  This evening I went to an electronics store to buy some phone cords and one of those little dual phone line jack thingies.  I'm trying to get our little office set up so that Jane and I each have a phone line at our desks for the internet.  Anyway, the second I come to a stop in the store, an employee instantly materializes with a friendly, "Can I help you?"  I told him I was just looking.  The second I turned to move down an aisle, he followed right behind me.  I mean RIGHT behind me.  I was immediately unnerved and came to a sudden stop.  He didn't run into me, but his breath did.  I decided to throw him off a little by backtracking, so I pretended that there was something interesting on the shelves that I had just passed.  Hah!  I caught him off guard - he didn't know what to do.  Oh yeah, back up, he thinks.  So he backs up, and I'm standing there looking at...hmm, what AM I looking at?  Ah, there we go - blank CD-ROMs.  So I'm pretending to look at these things, and he says helpfully, "Blank CDs."  I grunt and head back down the aisle, Tweedle-Dee at my heels.  I try doing a few laps around one small aisle, but I can't seem to shake him.  And then I see the phone cords.  Ah, good.  So I'm looking at them, trying to figure out if I need 7 feet or 15 feet, trying to do mental calculations in my head, when I hear a voice right behind me.  "Phone cords."  What do you say in response to that?  So I grunt again.  Meanwhile, I'm standing there a long time, trying to figure out how I'm going to configure our office, and it's a lot of pressure!  Just standing in one place, not looking at anything, just staring blankly.  I think Tweedle-Dee got a bit uncomfortable with that, so he said, "Anything else?"  I just said I was thinking and tried to get the thinking over with so I could just get out of there.  So then I decide I had what I needed but I wanted to try to shake this guy one last time.  It's a very small store, maybe the size of a regular 7-11.  I did a couple quick stops and starts, but he seemed to be warming up and was now pacing me like a pro.  But as I ventured into the car audio section, into the very back corner, I noticed I had lost him!  Looking around, I saw he was just on the other side of the car audio, waiting for me.  But I won!  I decided enough was enough, so I made a beeline for the register.  Of course, Tweedle-Dee was going to be my cashier.  He looked at my phone cords, read the labels and said, "These two are 15-feet long.  This one is 7 feet."  For the third time, I stifled an overly sarcastic reply, and grunted.  I paid my two dollars for the three cords and I was out of there.  After a trip like that, I really appreciate the independent approach in American stores.  If you want help, you find someone and ask them for it.  Sure, sometimes they're hard to find, but isn't that more preferable than having someone follow you around, watching your every shopping move?  I'd be curious if anyone reading this has had a similar experience and actually ENJOYS the "hovering" approach to customer service.  Maybe it's just me...

      One day, Jane and I were driving around, just minding our own business.  Traffic was sort of bad, and when I saw an opportunity to sneak up the shoulder a little, I took it.  Keep in mind, this is a lanes-optional kind of country.  Well, it turned out that there was a policeman up ahead, right on the shoulder.  I immediately signalled to get back into the flow of traffic, and I succeeded, but he started eyeballing me.  I wanted to pretend I had no idea there was a policeman there, but his gaze was a little too sharp, and when I looked back at him, he waved me over to the shoulder.  When I rolled down the window, he immediately told me the two things that I did wrong, and that I owed a total of about US $75, which I had to pay right away downtown.  After a couple minutes explaining my wrongs, and how much each of the two offenses were to cost me, the policeman said, "Or, you can just pay [the equivalent of] US $13 now, and this will be a warning."  Now immediately the alarm went off in my head:  "Whooooop!  Whooooop!  BRIBE ALERT...BRIBE ALERT..."  So I asked some more questions to figure out how this all worked.  And sure enough, I heard right.  Traffic violations, $75; traffic warning, $13.  Get ready for the justification...  My wife and I had just a little bit of time to get to the travel agent, in order to pick up our plane tickets for our flights home for Christmas.  We didn't have the TIME to go into the city to pay this ticket.  And I was feeling adequately warned.  So I reached in my pocket, pulled out [the equivalent of] US $26 ($13 for each offense), when the policeman said, "No, no...just $13."  So I thought, well, maybe he's corrupt, but at least he's not greedy.  So what do you think?  Was this a bribe?  What would YOU have done?  And is bribing even a sin?  The Bible has several verses that speak out against  accepting  a bribe (Deut 16:19 is a good place to start), but I could not find any that condemn  giving  one.

      This past weekend, as I continued reading through  The Power of a Praying Husband , I was convicted about how I pray.  I am not in the habit of considering the state of my heart before I approach God in prayer.  Sometimes I'm downright cavalier about prayer.  However, there are a few verses that strongly encourage me to do just that.   If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.   -- Ps 66:18  If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, even his prayers are detestable.   -- Pr 28:9  Husbands...be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect...so that nothing will hinder your prayers.   -- 1 Pet 3:7  Omartian tells us, " What is in our hearts when we pray has more effect on whether our prayers are answered than the actual prayer itself."   At first I recoiled at her statement.  However, I can't discard the above verses.  There is some kind of cause and effect relationship between the state of my heart and the efficacy of my prayers.  Omartian continues, " Praying for your wife must begin with praying for yourself. "

      This morning, I began reading  The Power of a Praying Husband  by Stormie Omartian.  The book begins with the premise that "Change her, God!" is a prayer that may seldom be answered.  Instead, I should look at Jane from God's perspective and pray for her with that in mind.  Any changes that come about will likely happen to  me .  This all started a few months ago when Jane started reading  The Power of a Praying Wife , which Stormie Omartian wrote in 1997.  It seems to really encourage her in her prayers for me.  Not only that, it really honors  me  to see Jane reading a book all about how she can pray for me.  ME!  I feel humbled and special and motivated to "endeavor to deserve her" (one of Jane's favorite quotes from "Sense and Sensibility").  Maybe that's part of the blessing coming from these books.  The focus is not how you can pray to change your spouse.  The focus of The Power of a Praying Husband is on how to pray selflessly for my wife in different areas of her life, from her moods to her priorities to her beauty and sexuality to her fears.   urlLink Curt's musings  this morning were timely for me, as I consider that I bought this book because of something I saw in Jane's life that I wanted to emulate.  She definitely influences me through her walk.  Do I influence her?  Perhaps, but in different ways.  I think this touches on the topic of spiritual leadership, but that's another post altogether...  Meanwhile, I thank God for my wife and how different she is from me.  I am a better man because of her.

      I started this blog as a sort of experiment.  I thought it would perhaps be a good vehicle for me to dwell on and process things happening in my life.  I like to journal, but am very inconsistent.  If you look at my journals here (which you can't, by the way!), you will see gaps of days, weeks or even months in between entries.  Actually, my last entry may be over a year old.  Even in a journal I started for my then-unborn son, I have been negligent at recording this time in my life for him.  There is a certain accountability in having a weblog.  If you want to be read, you have to be regular.  It doesn't hurt if you actually have something to say.  So like a newswriter, I find myself each day thinking, "What can I write?"  This gets me thinking more about things I have been reading, experiences I have been having, etc.  So I would say thus far, "Mission accomplished."  While it is tempting to read a zillion blogs a day, it's probably not the best use of my time.  A good use, perhaps, since there are some great blogs out there, but not the  best  use.  So I will limit myself to a few.  I especially appreciate the positive focus of  urlLink The Happy Husband ; the encouragement and teaching of  urlLink Jollyblogger ; and the daily reflections found on  urlLink Brutally Honest ,  urlLink foodforfish  and  urlLink Becoming a Benedictine Monk .  God bless you all as you serve the King through your lives, and as you share yourselves with the greater community online.

      Right now I'm going through a devotional for men called  urlLink Men of Integrity , put out by Promise Keepers.  Today's devotional by Howard Hendricks fits well with what I wrote yesterday about accountability.  Dr. Hendricks encourages each of us to seek to have three individuals in our lives:  a Paul, a Barnabas and a Timothy.  A Paul would be an older man who would be willing to mentor you.  He doesn't necessarily have to be a super-Christian, just someone whose faith you would want to emulate.  A Barnabas would be a peer, someone who is pretty much where you are in your walk and to whom you could be accountable.  And Timothy would be a younger believer to whom you would share your life and whatever insights you've picked up so far.  I guess it follows that if you have a Paul, Barnabas and Timothy that you  become  a Timothy, Barnabas and Paul at the same time.  For myself, and perhaps for most people, finding a Barnabas is the easiest part.  I think it is natural to think of most of your friends as peers.  To find a Paul means acknowledging I have a need - a need for advice, a need for "fatherly" encouragement and yes, a need for rebuke.  To find a Timothy doesn't necessarily mean that we imply "I'm up here and you're down there," but that could be an underlying feeling that blocks me (and you?) from seeking out a Timothy.  All three relationships, however, are hard for me to establish, perhaps because I am not one who easily opens up around people.  I am much more comfortable with the idea of sitting at the online feet of Ravi Zacharias or Chuck Swindoll than I am meeting with a guy in person.  Same with a Timothy.  If I were to find a Timothy, couldn't I just recommend to him some resources that impacted me and my walk with the Lord?   "Hey, buddy, here are some great websites...here's a list of must-read books...oh you gotta check out these blogs...now on your way, and I'll be praying for ya!  E-mail me if you have any questions...later, man!"   Is this a typical guy thing, or just a Joe thing?

       A single arrow is easily broken, but not ten in a bundle.  -- Japanese proverb  Getting an accountability partner was one of the best things I could have done, both for myself and for my marriage.  I think everyone knows and acknowledges the value of accountability partners or groups, but in my opinion, few actually are involved in an accountability relationship with someone.  I'm not saying this from my pedestal; I'm 35 and have been a Christian for over 10 years, yet have just gotten into accountability with someone in the past six months.  So what does accountability look like?  I think it depends on the relationship.  Obviously one-on-one accountability will look different than a group accountability.  In my case, my buddy and I answer certain questions each week.  I actually decided which questions I wanted to have to answer, since I know best the areas in which I am weak.  With some accountability groups, the last question is, "Did you lie at all when you answered any of the previous questions?"  I don't know how helpful that question is, because if someone wanted to lie about their answers, how hard would it be to just say "No" to that last one?  One of the greatest benefits to an accountability relationship is that you find that you are not alone.  Having a friend who not only understands my struggles, but goes through them in his own life, makes the fight seem more winnable.  Another benefit is that there are some things I struggle with (like lust) that are best discussed with someone other than my wife.  Every guy deals with lust in some way, but no wife should be reminded of that regularly.  A third benefit is that I now have someone to whom I can turn if I have ANY questions about marriage, communication, sex, raising kids - anything!  The door is already open to be honest with this person, so who better (aside from Jane, of course) to get opinions or feedback from?  Do you have an accountability partner?  I'd suggest you hook up with one now - even if you don't feel particularly tempted in the areas of lust, pride, gluttony - whatever.  I wish I had.

      In the States, everything runs (or  should  run) according to schedule.  Expectations are clearly laid out, and in many jobs you merely have to check the boxes to know that you are doing your job.  Here, I find that my job performance is more qualitative rather than quantitative.  I don't have boxes to check off; instead, I have a statement:  "Do such-and-such" and I have to figure out what that means.  I have to make up my own boxes, which goes counter to my personality.  So I got stressed.  I have an ambiguous job description, no daily schedule and very loose supervision.  The result?  I sometimes went through long periods of time with nothing to show for it.  And in the past, I had filled my times of "I don't know what to do" with surfing the internet.  And that hurt my wife, who saw my struggles and didn't know how to help me.  Fortunately, things came to a head and Jane helped me realize that my life needed to change immediately.  I have since turned things around, limiting my internet time and refocusing on my tasks at hand.  This involves confronting my inabilities rather than avoiding them.  This, in part, is why I have this blog.  So I guess my point is that your average missionary doesn't just have to deal with the stresses of living in another culture, but may also have to deal with the stresses of different expectations, even within his or her own organization.

      One thing that strikes me as funny is that in our first two years here, we said the word 'missionary' aloud maybe a handful of times.  If that many.  In a place where missionaries are not really welcome, we have to be careful how we speak of ourselves.  So we just say things like "people like us," or "people in our line of work" or just "m's".  When we went back to the States over Christmas, it was surreal to not only SAY the word 'missionary' but to  BE  a missionary.  Over here, we are technically not missionaries.  We have other roles that we fill, and it is by  those  roles that we define who we are here.  People who work in sensitive areas rarely are able to tell you the whole story about what they are doing.  So when they are back home for furlough, talk to them!  Ask them questions.  These people love to share about "real life" where they are, but many times people just don't ask.

      Today we're going to a nearby resort with a couple of friends, just for the night.  When we lived in the States, we never stayed anywhere fancier than a Holiday Inn, except for anniversary trips to a mountain cabin.  Yet over here, we can stay in a 5-star hotel or resort for about the same price as at an average hotel in the States.  Should we feel guilty?  Nahhh...

      Yesterday, I was asked if I would allow myself to be "put on the ballot" for director of our group.  Just about the newest guy on the block, and they want  ME  to lead them?  We're not a huge group, so obviously everyone has to do something.  And I've been critical in the past of people who have turned down nominations just because they're "too busy."  So my first reaction was, of course I should let myself be nominated, if only on principle.  But after talking about it with Jane and another friend, I realized that if I say I will let my name stand, that means I have to be willing to actually assume the role if elected.  And in our group, I think the cost to the family is too great.  The director travels constantly, perhaps spending only half (if that) of his or her time at home.  If the spouse travels, it is at their own expense.  As a husband and new father, I just don't know that I can accept this nomination.  I feel guilty.  I feel hypocritical.  I feel I'm letting the group down.  But I suppose all of that is better than the feelings I would have if I were a full-time director and a part-time husband and father.

      As you may guess, my wife and I are missionaries.  We're somewhere in Asia.  The country and the organization are not really important, and since I am in a politically or religiously sensitive area, it's best I not really get into that anyway.  The one thing that I, and most missionaries I know, struggle with is the "Super Christian" status put upon us by our friends, families and churches.  As a result, there is considerable pressure not to let these people in on our little secret:  We are sinners!  We are ordinary!  We may actually be LESS spiritual now than before we left!  From time to time, my wife and I will remark, "If our church knew about [insert activity, philosophy or other lifestyle feature here], they would yank our support!"  Now I must add here that we come from a church that is much more conservative than we are; we are  not  living like heathens here.  I don't claim to represent all missionaries.  I do claim to speak for many, who are stressed out at being put up on a towering pedestal from which they had better not fall.

      I'm brand new to the blogging world.  For a while I was a critic.  I mean, why would people spend lots of their time updating and maintaining a website that may have just a handful of readers?  One day, my wife (Jane Missionary) found and then introduced me to the blog  urlLink  The Happy Husband  .  And as I read Curt's blog and the blogs of people he links to on his page, I saw that at the very least, blogs are read by other bloggers fairly faithfully.  I am at a crossroads in my life, realizing that I had some unhealthy patterns in my life that needed some immediate changes.  One area is in the lack of introspection into my heart and spiritual life.  Perhaps through this blog I can work out my faith in writing (with fear and trembling, of course).  So in a way, this blog is for me.  Feel free to read, though.  :)

       &nbsp; Today is BlogSwap day, and I'm happy to&nbsp;introduce the following post courtesy of&nbsp;Spy Journal:   I have just accepted a position on a committee for our church board. I have been appointed for my management expertise. The committee is looking at some specific issues that need to be resolved, and I can see why my management skills will be needed and used. My question is this; how much of business management can be translated into church management? Should we manage churches in the same manner as businesses, that is, is the accountability and reporting structure used in business the same? Are KPI's really necessary in a church environment and if so, should they be what a pastor's performance is measured on? Real Live Preacher makes this interesting by demonstrating the soft side to church in his post  urlLink All the Right Questions . It will be interesting applying business management processes to the church structure. I am sure I will learn a lot.    urlLink Spy Journal &nbsp;- An&nbsp;intimate peek into my life.

      For this week's Theology Thursday topic, let me just go ahead and start out with my "shock statement:" Christians should do away with tithing. Okay, now that I got that out of the way, let's go to the Bible.   God instituted tithing back in the day of Moses. Actually, there were at least two separate tithes (perhaps 3, if you consider the sacred feast in Deut 12:17-18):    1.    A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the Lord  (Lev 27:30). This was paid to the Levites, who gave a tenth of  that  to the priests (Nu 18:26).    2.    At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year's produce and store it in your towns...  (Deut 14:28). This tithe was again for the non-salaried Levites but also for the widows, orphans and the destitute.   Nowhere in the New Testament is there any command to tithe.&nbsp;In fact, the word "tithe" is only mentioned like 3 times in the whole New Testament.&nbsp;Why is this? Well, look at the recipients of the tithe: primarily the Levites and the priests. Christ's death did away with our need for the temple (and its workers) and for the priests as intercessors; we can all now access God directly. There is no Jew nor Greek - we are all priests now, and the "chosen people" are now lumped in with the rest of the races on planet Earth (or rather, WE were lumped/grafted in with THEM). The tithe is the law; we are no longer under law but under grace (Rom 6:15).   Now keep reading, before you start thinking you're getting off easy. Jesus came to tell us that it's all about where your heart is, not just your actions. Don't murder? Piece of cake. Don't be angry with your brother and insult him (Matt 5:21-22)? Much harder. Don't commit adultery? I can do that. Don't look at a woman lustfully (Matt 5:27-28)? Ouch. So when I tell you that the New Testament doesn't support tithing (which literally means "tenthing"), guess what? I think the Bible implies we should be giving much more than that. My intro statement was that Christians should do away with tithing...I never said we should do away with giving. Consider the following quote from 2nd century Church father Irenaeus (the disciple of Polycarp, who was John's disciple - so I guess that makes him Jesus' great granddisciple): " The Jews were constrained to a regular payment of tithes; Christians, who have liberty, assign all their possessions to the Lord, bestowing freely not the lesser portions of their property, since they have the hope of greater things. "   Here's what Christian Generation 1.0 showed us about how to give. They sold their stuff and gave money to any (believers) in need (Acts 2:45). They sold property and gave the entire amount to the work of the apostles (Acts 4:36-5:2). They generously and enthusiastically gave towards Paul's work, giving "as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability" (2 Cor 8:1-5). They supported Paul over and above his need (Phil 4:18) "again and again" (Phil 4:16). These people were living out Jesus' words, "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" (Matt 6:21).   You know, Paul DOES tell us that we should set aside a portion of our income each week. He doesn't say how much, but does imply that if you make very little, you give very little; if you make a lot, you give a lot. He tells the Corinthians,  Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver  (2 Cor 9:7). How many times do pastors put us "under compulsion" by implying we're sinning if we don't obey "God's command to tithe?" How many times are we guilt-tripped into tithing because we're robbing God if we don't (Mal 3:8-9)? I'm sorry, but I think that keeping a ministry going (and funded) sometimes motivates pastors into misapplying what God says about tithing. Or maybe these pastors are just frustrated because the average American Christian puts 2.5% of his/her income into the offering plate. It's amazing that the Jews under the Law gave 23% a year, while we under grace give a tenth of that.   Bottom line: We, as believers, should be giving generously and even sacrificially towards God's work. How many of us do that? I have to admit that Jane and I still feel that we're not there. We still take too much and give too little. So I'm not just preaching here; I'm praying.   Next week's topic: Crowns Are More Than Heavenly Frisbees

      I'm happy to announce that Jane and I are expecting Baby #2!&nbsp; We are right now experiencing great joy and a little sadness at the same time.&nbsp; Why, you ask?&nbsp; Well, I shouldn't even need to explain the 'great joy' part.&nbsp; But sadness?  You see, we've been married five and a half years now.&nbsp; After four and a half, we were blessed with a little baby boy.&nbsp; Our life with Junior has been  urlLink  so very special  .&nbsp; He's our guy!&nbsp; We have gone to the beach, to the mountains, to cold countries and to hot countries.&nbsp; We have spent Christmas together in the United States.&nbsp; Most of all, we've hung out at our home and enjoyed being a family together.&nbsp; Of course, for the first several months, he was hardly aware we existed, but that's been part of the joy as well - seeing him become more and more interactive, more and more an active participant in our lives.&nbsp; It's not uncommon for us to go visit someone and I just watch Junior the whole time.&nbsp; Literally watch him.&nbsp; He's so very fun and interesting and cute.  And now Junior is going to have to share us.  So one aspect of this pregnancy, we feel, is that we are going to have to grieve the loss of the "just the 3 of us" feeling.&nbsp; It's very similar to properly grieving the loss of bachelorhood before I got married.&nbsp; I don't think there's anything at all wrong with saying, "You know what?&nbsp; I'm looking forward to the next stage of life, but I will miss certain things about where I'm at right now."&nbsp; And of course, once we reach that stage, we say, "Oh yeah - it's worth it alright!"&nbsp; So  while we are very excited to be expecting another, we already feel a little sad that it won't be just the three of us anymore.  BUT...how much do you wanna bet that 9 months from now, I will be on top of the world, ecstatic to have a family of four?

         &nbsp;  Well, folks, he's done it.&nbsp;  urlLink  Lance Armstrong   has won a record six  urlLink  Tours de France   - and he's done them consecutively.&nbsp; His feat is truly amazing, but as I mentioned  urlLink  last week  , it wouldn't have been possible without "The Blue Train," the eight domestiques who protected Lance, neutralized any attacks and basically made this year's Tour one of the easiest for Lance to win.&nbsp; A few quotes from Lance following his glorious moment on the winner's podium in Paris, along with my comments:   “ I believe that the man who works the hardest is the man who deserves to win .”&nbsp; During the off-season, Lance and the  urlLink  U.S. Postal Team   spend months in the Pyrenees and the Alps, riding up and down the mountains which usually determine the winner.&nbsp; We're told by Paul that  in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize  (1 Cor 9:24).&nbsp; Lance and his team were truly "running" in such a way as to get the prize.&nbsp; What prize am I running for?&nbsp; What about you?   “ When it’s pouring rain and you have to go and ride six hours in the mountains, there’s no fun in doing that.&nbsp; There’s no one cheering – or booing – on the side of the road, but that’s what makes the difference ."&nbsp; Here, Lance was referring to their training.&nbsp; During the individual time trial a few days ago, over a million people were lining the roadside all the way along the 55-kilometer course.&nbsp; During their training, who knows...a handful?&nbsp; Farmer Pierre and his sheep?&nbsp; Likewise, as we strive for our prize, may we be diligent to persevere even when no one is looking.&nbsp; May we be faithful to go out there and do what God has called us to do, whether the conditions are favorable or not.   " If I can climb the top step and make history, that will be the moment that I care for .”&nbsp; Ahh, here we see Lance's very understandable motivation - to make history.&nbsp; This he has done.&nbsp; But going back to Paul... They do it to get a crown  [or yellow jersey]  that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever  (1 Cor 9:25).&nbsp; Lance's prize is the envy of the cycling world, but that yellow jersey won't do anything for him before God.   So "All Hail King Lance" today.&nbsp; Let him have his moment.&nbsp; But remember that his yellow jersey is nothing but a shop rag, when you consider not only our heavenly rewards, but also the present rewards that come from a life devoted to God here on this earth.

      Dear Junior,  Today, I celebrate your first year of life on earth.&nbsp; One year ago today, I saw you enter this world with squinty eyes and tiny screams.&nbsp; You lay on a little table under bright lights, naked and cold.&nbsp; As I took your picture, I said out loud, "He's perfect."&nbsp; A few minutes later, when you were bundled up, I got to hold you for the first time.&nbsp; I think that a special bond happened that day.&nbsp; Much is said about the mother-baby bond, but I can tell you that there is a father-son bond that is unique and magical.  As I look back on this past year, I have some great memories.&nbsp; I remember how I used to swaddle you so snugly.&nbsp; I remember getting you to do pull-ups with my fingers your very first week.&nbsp; I remember having you asleep in "the crook" of my crossed leg during church services.&nbsp; I remember our little exercise routine that we would do.&nbsp; It helped calm you down when you were having your gas pains the first few months.&nbsp; I remember never wanting to lay you down when you were sleeping; always wanting to hold you, and never wanting to give you to anyone else.&nbsp; I remember not changing your diapers for two weeks because your two stumps (umbilical and circumcision) were too gross for me to handle.&nbsp; I remember your first little smiles, and how we could get you to smile by clapping and saying, "Yaaayyyyyy!!!!"&nbsp; I remember how you seemed to like the very cold weather in Germany, and you would blow spit bubbles as soon as the wind started hitting your face.&nbsp; I remember how great you always were about being passed from stranger to stranger - all our local and foreign friends who love you so much.&nbsp; I remember watching Finding Nemo, with you on my lap.&nbsp; It took a couple weeks, since you could only really watch about 10 minutes at a time.&nbsp; I remember that you were always as active as your little body would let you be.&nbsp; I will always remember how you would jump as long as we would hold you up, way before you were even ready to stand.&nbsp; I remember, though I'd like to forget, how you jumped in your little "Jolly Jumper" until you got blisters that popped and bled.&nbsp; Sorry, buddy.&nbsp; You never even seemed to notice.&nbsp; I remember the peek-a-boo game we always played with you, using your woobie, and I remember how you loved to start the game by covering your own face.&nbsp; I'm convinced you have an advanced sense of humor.&nbsp; I remember that your way of laughing was to cough, and when you genuinely had to cough, you thought it was funny.&nbsp; I remember how my little cellphone motivated you to crawl and walk, and the beaming look on your face when you heard one of my ring tones.&nbsp; I remember that every time I went into the store room/workshop, which was the only room forbidden to you, I'd hear the little "smack smack" of your hands as you crawled furiously toward me.&nbsp; You would get to within two feet of me, stand up on your knees and throw yourself forward, knowing I would catch you, sweep you up and give you a brief tour of the workshop and tools.&nbsp; I remember how fearlessly you dove off of the couch or off of the edge of the pool, knowing that your mom or I would catch you.&nbsp; I remember how great you sang into the microphone while listening to Raffi.&nbsp; I also remember how much you love Mom's drumsticks.&nbsp; I remember your first word, "Mama," and how you called me that as well (you still do sometimes).&nbsp; I remember watching you take your first steps, and how proud I was as you got more and more brave about walking.&nbsp; I remember how fast you learned to say "please" in sign language, and how you'd say it after each bite of food.&nbsp; I remember how you'd pick up a telephone, cellphone or remote control (and even your little stuffed bear Green Bean), put it to your ear and say, "Hi!"&nbsp; And I remember, just this week, how you would throw yourself on one of our big pillows with a big grin on your face, waiting for us throw the other on you to make a "Junior Sandwich."  Above all, I remember a baby who became a boy.&nbsp; Don't forget you're my best friend, and I love you very much.  Love, Dad

      There's something interesting about bands or artists who are wildly famous because of one song, and then fade into obscurity, never to be heard from again.&nbsp; "Video Killed the Radio Star" (the Buggles).&nbsp; "99 Red Balloons" (Nina).&nbsp; "I'll Be There For You" (the Rembrants).&nbsp; Then there are the dance hits.&nbsp; "Achy Breaky Heart," "Macarena," or "The Ketchup Song."&nbsp; Maybe the artists weren't really that good.&nbsp; Maybe the fickle listening audience got bored too quickly.&nbsp; Who knows?  [insert weak transition to something serious here]  Have you ever known anyone who went overseas as a missionary, planning to devote their whole life to overseas missions work, only to come crashing home during their first term?&nbsp; Or maybe they came home on furlough and said "No way" to returning to the field?&nbsp; These are the "One-Term Wonders," and I believe we need to think about them a little bit.  People who come home prematurely need lots of love and understanding.&nbsp; They obviously had encountered some great stresses on the field, stresses which they maybe could not even share these with their churches and friends back home.&nbsp; And yet, when they return home, they also have to deal with a sense of guilt.&nbsp; Perhaps their church had invested much into their development, not to mention financial support while they were on the field.&nbsp; They have to go to church every Sunday knowing that people are whispering, "See that guy?&nbsp; He couldn't hack it on the mission field, so he had to go back to being an accountant."&nbsp; I know people who have left our church immediately upon returning early from the mission field.  So if you know someone who has come home early from the field, be supportive.&nbsp; Encourage the person to talk about it with you, and affirm them in their decision to come home.&nbsp; As I have mentioned already once or twice, this hierarchy in the church has to go.&nbsp; Whether this person is a missionary or an accountant, they can do great things for God.&nbsp; They need to hear this, to know this...otherwise, we risk allowing this brother or sister to believe that they have taken a step down the rung of serving the King.

      One of my theological pet peeves is when good-hearted Christians believe something they are told, without bothering to check it out themselves.&nbsp; Many of my Theology Thursday topics seek to address and challenge those teachings which are more based on tradition or culture, rather than the Bible.&nbsp; Today we'll look at polygamy.&nbsp; Let me preface my comments by saying that I am looking at polygamy solely from a theological perspective, not a legal one.   I'll start with my opinion, which I believe is based on a comprehensive view of what the Bible says about it.&nbsp; God prefers monogamy but does not require it.   The first recorded polygamist in the Bible is Lamech, the seventh generation of humankind.&nbsp; See, perfect number 7; I rest my case.&nbsp; Kidding!&nbsp; Moving on to Abraham, the father of faith himself.&nbsp; True, you can't necessarily call his thing with Hagar polygamy; maybe call it spouse-endorsed adultery instead.&nbsp; However, we see in Gen 25:6 that Abraham did have more than one concubine, at least one of whom he married (Gen 25:1).&nbsp; The man after God's own heart, King David, had at least seven sons with seven different wives (2 Sam 3:2-5; 12:24) and took an additional unknown number of wives and concubines (2 Sam 5:13).&nbsp; I don't even need to mention his son Solomon's 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Ki 11:3), but looky there, I just did.   The Biblical record shows that God does not condemn or outlaw this practice of polygamy, except for kings.&nbsp; In Deut 17:17 we read,  He  [the king]  must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray .&nbsp; Indeed, David and Solomon lived some pretty messed-up lives, to a large degree because of all those wild oats being sown.&nbsp; However, while God does not condemn polygamy for you and me, he does demonstrate that monogamy was His plan for us all along.&nbsp; Starting with Adam and Eve, you can't read Gen 2:23-24 and  not  think that the ideal formula was 1 man + 1 woman = 1 flesh.&nbsp; In the New Testament, we don't read much about polygamy, but it must have still been practiced, because we see that monogamy was a requirement for overseers (1 Tim 3:2), deacons (1 Tim 3:12) and elders (Tit 1:6).   Another very touchy area regarding polygamy is that of adultery.&nbsp; If you accept the practice of polygamy, you have to then accept that one man will be sexually active with more than one woman.&nbsp; If both women are his wives, does that make it okay?&nbsp; Also consider that the man does not suddenly get married to his second wife; there has to be a courtship or at least some sort of pre-marriage activity.&nbsp; Does the husband need his wife's permission to search for number two, or does he "court" number two behind number one's back?&nbsp; If he does, is that wrong?&nbsp; The Bible is mute on the topic, most likely because God does not want to encourage polygamy.   I close with a couple cross-cultural things to chew on.&nbsp; Picture working with an indigenous people group, many of whom have come to Christ.&nbsp; While discipling them as they begin forming their own Christian community, you realize that none of the men are qualified to be elders or deacons in their church because they are all polygamous.&nbsp; What do you advise?&nbsp; Should they divorce all but one of their wives?&nbsp; Or should they just say, "Aw, what the heck... someone's  gotta be our elder!"&nbsp; The other interesting tidbit, which you may not know, is that polygamy is the general term for multiple spouses.&nbsp;  Polygyny  is having more than one wife;  polyandry  is having more than one husband.&nbsp; Polyandry is practiced in some rural parts of India, Nepal, Tibet, China and Africa.   I started out by saying  God prefers monogamy but does not require it .&nbsp; I like to use shock-value wording sometimes, so I hope you'll forgive me for that.&nbsp; I really do believe that while God does not condemn polygamy, His support of monogamy is unquestionable.

      As I continue reading    urlLink What Kids Need Most in a Dad   , I am challenged to be a deliberate father.&nbsp; The author asks some excellent questions that we would all do well to take the time to answer:   1.&nbsp; What character qualities do you want your children to have by the time they're 21 years old?&nbsp; How do you plan to  ensure  that they have them? 2.&nbsp; What are the three most important rules for your children?&nbsp; If they were asked the same question, would they come up with the same answers as you? 3.&nbsp; How are your kids different?&nbsp; What are you doing to provide for and even enhance their differences? 4.&nbsp; If someone were to ask your children, "What's really important in your family?" how would they answer? 5.&nbsp;  In the past two weeks , what  specifically  did you do with your children to influence their character, improve their skills or shape their attitudes?  For me, I think the greatest challenge was that I unknowingly had a mindset of "lifestyle parenting" rather than deliberate parenting.&nbsp; Lifestyle parenting, as I call it, is about as useful as lifestyle evangelism.&nbsp; Meaning...it's only as effective as your lifestyle (duh).&nbsp; Let's be honest:&nbsp; lifestyle evangelism is  usually  pretty weak as a form of evangelism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As  urlLink  theomorph   has pointed out, all it [usually] shows is that we're good people.&nbsp; Anyway, the same applies to parenting.&nbsp; We need to do more than just live in front of them and hope they absorb our godly character.&nbsp; My son should learn about what is right from my lips.&nbsp; And when I myself miss the mark, he needs to see that I know that and that I still strive to live a godly life.&nbsp; I close with J.B. Phillips' translation of Ephesians 5:15-17:    Live life, then, with a due sense of responsibility, not as men who do not know the meaning of life but as those who do.&nbsp; Make the best use of your time, despite all the evils of these days.&nbsp; Don't be vague but grasp firmly what you know to be the will of the Lord.

      The  urlLink  Tour de France   is in its third and final week. The riders have gone through the initial flat stages, the killer Pyrenees Mountains, and now have entered the mighty Alps. Thomas Voeckler is currently leading the race, but is expected to lose the yellow jersey today. He is not a "mountain man," having lost all but 22 seconds of his almost 10-minute lead over Lance Armstrong in two big mountain days. Barring a meltdown (which is always possible), Lance should be in yellow today, and his team will fight to keep him in the  maillot jaune  ('yellow jersey') all the way to the finish line in Paris. If he wins, it truly will be because of his team. Let me tell you a little about how team cycling works.   Each team is built around a leader - the person most likely to win the event. The other 8 members of the team fill the role of  domestique , which is French for "servant." Regardless of how good you are, if you are a domestique, your job is to get your leader onto the winner's podium. Some domestiques have very specific roles. Some are great on the flat stretches, others are sprinters and still others are great at steep ascents. They serve the leader accordingly. In Lance's stage victory this past Saturday, certain pairs of guys were tasked with bringing Lance up (and down) each of the mountains.   Here are some things the  urlLink  US Postal   domestiques do for their captain Lance:   - They ride in front of him to break the wind resistance. This cuts down Lance's exertion by 40%.  - They get food and drinks from the team car, and then sprint back to the team to distribute it to everyone.  - They surround him when the pack is very thick, to protect him from accidents.  - When there is a breakaway, they chase the rider(s) down and rein them in.  - If Lance has a flat tire, one of them give him theirs. If he crashes, they give him one of their bikes.  - Everyone rotates in the front, pulling the rest of the team. Lance never has to.   These guys could care less where in the standings they eventually finish. They lead Lance as far as they can go, and when they're spent, they fall quickly to the back (sometimes the VERY back) in exhaustion as Lance powers to the finish. What kind of job is this? There's absolutely no glory for these guys...unless they're watching their leader up on the podium when it's all over.   So it is with the Body of Christ. We are organized around our Leader, and each of us has our supporting role as domestiques. For some of us, the supporting role is a little more high-profile. José Azevedo, leading Lance up the final mountain on Saturday, got a lot of camera time and praise from the announcers. Look at that, I even remember his name. On the flip side, most of the domestiques get almost zero camera time. They never show the guy with his jersey stuffed in the front and back with about 20 full water bottles, huffing and puffing back up to his team. To bring the analogy home, we have our "star Christians." They include pastors, writers and entertainers. Their work for the Leader gets lots of attention, and with it praise (and criticism). Our garden-variety domestiques, however, are everywhere. They are the Sunday school teachers, people who set up before church or run the sound system. They stuff bulletins, give a needy person a ride or lunch. Ideally, these people are not concerned with where "in the standings" they finish. They serve the Leader, confident of His sure victory.  &nbsp;  Lance's teammates naturally share in the spoils - it's not like they are minimum-wage burger flippers for their captain Ronald McDonald. So will we share in the glory and victory of our Leader when he assumes His place on the podium when this "Tour de Earth" is over. Okay, I'm analogy'd out. Have a great day!

      Like most bloggers, I started blogging not knowing how long I would do it. I had been in the blogosphere as a reader for less than a week, and said, "Why not?" As I mentioned in my first or second post, I am at a point in my life where I realized (thanks to Jane) a need to be more introspective. I've got issues with intimacy, a tendency towards internet addiction (probably connected with the intimacy thing), maybe other junk, too. How much is a result of my parents' divorce 20 years ago? Dunno. So I decided that blogging might be a good way for me to work through some of this, as well as tackling theological issues and stuff I face in daily life. When you blog, what you write has to be readable, and therefore thought through.   Many of you have written about the "slippery slope" of blogging, as my wife calls it. Today I'd like to draw your attention to a few great posts dealing with said slope. The first was written by Jeff at The Dawn Treader, called  urlLink  This Phenomenon Called Blogging  . Incidentally, my wife wrote a  urlLink  couple comments  &nbsp;to that post that are WELL worth the read. Mac Swift at Vessel of Honour also  urlLink  recently wondered   if he should even keep up blogging because of how it sucks him in. A third good read is from journeyman james, who worked through his motives and blog content  urlLink  here  .&nbsp; He closes with a creed written by St. John Damascene, and has made it his "Blog Creed." It reads as follows:  &nbsp;   In the first place, then, before speaking to you, I beseech Almighty God, to whom all things lie open, who knows my small capacity and my genuine intention, to bless the words of my mouth, and to enable me to bridle my mind and direct it to Him, to walk in His presence straightly, not declining to a plausible right hand, nor knowing the left. Then I ask all God’s people, the chosen ones of His royal priesthood, with the holy shepherd of Christ’s orthodox flock, who represents in his own person Christ’s priesthood, to receive my treatise with kindness. They must not dwell on my unworthiness, nor seek for eloquence, for I am only too conscious of my shortcomings. They must consider the thoughts themselves. The kingdom of heaven is not in word but in deed. Conquest is not my object. I raise a hand which is fighting for the truth—a willing hand under the divine guidance. Relying, then, upon substantial truth as my auxiliary, I will enter on my subject matter.   &nbsp;  Thanks for encouraging me along my spiritual journey, whether through your comments, e-mails or blogs you yourselves write.

      The past couple of months, we've had the unrivaled pleasure of watching our little Junior go from a crawling baby to a walking boy.  One of our favorite things to watch is when he pushes something around the room.  His favorite is a plastic chair, but he can also push around big plastic containers, wooden TV trays or his stroller.  However, those moments are becoming few and far between, now that he can [mostly] walk.  The other day, I took Junior to a nearby shopping center so Jane could have the apartment totally to herself for a few hours.  I let him push the stroller around the entire circuit of the ground floor, and he  loved  it.  When he would get into a good rhythm, going not too fast nor too slow for the rolling stroller, he would let out a yell of delight.  Of course, everyone loved watching this little guy go by.  But from time to time, he would stop, take his hands off the stroller, and stand straight up.  The reason?  He was just passing something very interesting.  One time it was shelves of stuffed and ceramic animals, another time it was little motorcycles and big wheels.  He would just look at those things, enthralled.  When this would happen, I started moving the stroller very slowly, as if to say, "Okay buddy, we're moving on here."  Junior would then do one of two things.  Either he would notice the moving stroller and catch up to it, continuing his journey; or, he would ignore the stroller and start walking to whatever diverted his attention.  My wife, unlike me, is a reflective person.  So now that she is reading Ken Gire's  The Reflective Life , she becomes doubly reflective.  Recently, she read about how we should be looking for Christ in our daily lives.  She wants to be more aware of the little things in life that show us Christ.  So when Jane had a similar experience with Junior the previous day, she inspired an analogy between Junior's journeys and our spiritual journey.  I am like Junior.  I'm moving forward, in a groove, loving every minute of it.  Letting out an occasional yell of delight.  Occasionally, I fall down.  No problem, my "stroller" is there and I use it to pull myself up and keep moving.  I don't have a clue what is ahead of me; I can't see a thing, just the stroller.  It doesn't seem to matter because the stroller never runs into anything.  I pass by lots of different things.  Some are interesting; some smell bad; some are boring and couldn't interest me in the slightest.  But I just love pushing my stroller, so I keep going.  But  sometimes , I see something that I can't resist.  The stroller keeps going, slowly, so what do I do?  Do I leave the security of the stroller?  Or break away and explore this temptation?  Even when I go look at that interesting thing, the stroller always seems to be waiting for me when I come back.  I sometimes look up and see my Father - he always seems to be right around the stroller.  Little do I know how often He is guiding the stroller so I don't hit the walls.  Little do I know that it is He who keeps the stroller moving to remind me that I have a destination, and that it's HIS destination.  Little do I know that when I fall, He holds the stroller still so I won't fall again when I try to get up.  I usually don't like to follow analogies to their every connection.  What is the stroller?  Would the Harry Potter book in the window represent Satan?  Should the four wheels of the stroller represent faith, hope, love and potluck (sorry, potbless) fellowship dinners?  I don't know.  My bottom-line glean from this analogy is that God is watching over us and is perhaps more involved in our journey than we know.  And He is faithful, even when we fall down or stray.  We're going out of town for the weekend, so no blogging until Monday.  I hope you all have a great weekend!

      This week's Theology Thursday is sort of a continuation of last week's post.  In case you missed  it  and don't care to read  it  right now, I basically said that God today does not speak to us personally.  For someone to hear the voice of the Lord would make him or her a prophet, and therefore subject to tests that frankly, they don't pass.  This week I'll share about how God DOES talk to us.  ----- I got some good feedback in response to my post last week - three specific comments, to be precise.   One  basically agreed with what I had to say,  one  basically disagreed and  one  said he wasn't sure what he thought.  Thank you three for what you shared.  I think that what disturbs me most about Christians seeking "a word from the Lord" is that they already have it!   In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son...  (Heb 1:1-2).  God's Word is still just as valid now as ever.  We don't need to ask, "Was that really God speaking?"  And yet, people prefer some kind of personal revelation.  Maybe it's a generational thing.  Christianity has gotten much more experiential.  Our worship songs are mush-fests, as we sing about wanting to taste and feel and fall in love with Jesus.  Is it any surprise, then, that people would rather  feel  God speaking rather than  read  what He already said?  We criticize those who claim truth is subjective, and then claim to have heard words from the Lord which can't be validated by anyone but the person who "heard" them.  We seek "breakthroughs" and want "fresh wind."  No Bible translation is  too  contemporary; we always want to hear God's Word in a new way.    All along I've been saying that I don't believe God speaks to individual Christians today.  Now I'd like to amend that slightly by saying I don't believe God gives  new revelation  to individual Christians today.  What's the difference?  Well, Jesus tells us that the Holy Spirit  will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you  (John 14:26).  So when you are in the mall and you feel like God is telling you to witness to the person sitting on the bench next to you, it makes sense that the Holy Spirit is bringing to mind what you know the Bible says about our responsibility to make disciples.  The Holy Spirit is continually working to illumine God's Word in our hearts and minds (1 Cor 2:12).  Yes, I agree with LJ that we should test what is going through our heads, to see whether or not it is of God.  Just because the voice in your head sounds like Charlton Heston or James Earl Jones doesn't mean it's necessarily God talking.  However, let's be clear about what we're saying, because as Rush Limbaugh says, "Words mean things."  If you say God is talking to you, you're claiming something far more significant than if you say the Holy Spirit is working in your heart to help you understand and apply God's Word.  "Take responsibility for your actions," goes part of one of the Army's principles of leadership.  Too many Christians these days are avoiding responsibility by laying it on God.  "God didn't call me to do that."  "The Lord told me to say this."  "I just didn't feel led."  You know what?  We have good minds, capable of making good decisions.  Where we lack the ability to make good decisions, God promises wisdom in abundance (James 1:5).  He has also given us His Spirit, so that we can understand and apply the Word of God in our daily activities.  There is nothing wrong with saying, "I didn't think that would be a good thing to do at this point."  It's not unspiritual to use the mind and common sense that God gave you.  What I learned in seminary is that to change your theology about something, you have to be willing to reevaluate every event in your life to which that theology applied.  For some, that might be just too hard.  To be honest, even though seminary was 5 years ago, I am still going through that process.

      I'm sure most people who live in or visit another country have come across things that rub them the wrong way.  Maybe they are annoyed that people don't line up in one straight line when buying something from a cashier.  Maybe they hate that the signs are all in some "weird" script, with not even the common courtesy of Roman letters underneath.  Maybe the taxi drivers are too pushy, grabbing for and fighting for their bags before they even are off the boat.  These are things that I call "culture shock."  Even though I have been here for over two years, there are still things that irk me.  I'm trying to get over my American ethnocentrism, but from time to time I just need to let off a little steam, okay?  The other day we went to the gas station.  I usually pay with my credit card, since we get frequent flyer miles for each US dollar spent.  However, for some reason, my credit card has never, ever worked when I try to pay at the pump.  When I present my card to the cashier inside, it almost always has worked (maybe one time it didn't).  Don't ask me why this is.  Anyway, I have gotten into the habit of simply going inside first to pay, handing them the credit card while saying "Fill 'er up on pump 3!"  More times than not, the person then hands the card to a fellow employee, who runs outside to my pump to try to swipe my card there.  No matter how many times I tell them it WON'T work outside but WILL work inside, they insist on going through this routine.  This even happens at stations I go to frequently!  To make matters worse, when they DO decide to let me use my card inside, they feel that they have to put a dollar amount on the card right up front.  When you're filling up your tank, who knows how much it will be?  So I have to either put in less than a full tank because I underestimated, or I put too much on the card and they refund me some cash.  I don't know much about Point-Of-Sale machines, but I do know that these people could just hold their horses and charge me just for the amount of gas I got.  Of course, if I wanted to buy a coke, I have to pay cash, because by the time I get inside from pumping, they're already printing my receipt.  You know what?  Looking back on this, it's pretty petty.  But I think that over time, little annoyances can cause big headaches when I'm used to the efficiency of the way they do things back home.  Maybe it's not even efficiency - maybe the American way is slower.  But it's the way I prefer it.

      Randy Alcorn, in his book   urlLink Money, Possessions and Eternity   brings up a great analogy for the way we look at life.  He is specifically referring to finances, but the principle applies to all of life.  Most of us, at some time or another, have tried to fathom what eternity will be like.  I, for one, can't imagine not getting bored.  I think there MUST be coffee shops and soccer in heaven.  Anyway, Alcorn uses the image below to introduce his exhortation:     --------------------------------------->   (sorry for the cheesy graphic - I'm not an HTML guru and can't seem to show jpg's here)  Imagine that the above is my life.  The dot is where I am right now; living my regular human life on Earth.  The line is eternity, where I'll spend it in heaven.  Alcorn argues that most people focus so much on that dot that they forget the line that is to follow.  They are "living for the dot," whether it be in the area of finance and investing, general lifestyle, comfort, etc.  Nonbelievers naturally live for the dot.  Either they don't see the line, don't believe in the line or they think that the dot is so much bigger than the line is long.  Believers, on the other hand, should live radically different lives from their non-believing friends, knowing that eternity is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY longer than the few years we get here on earth.  So do we?  Let me make it more personal.  Do YOU?  Do I?  I have to admit that all too often, I'm smack in the middle of the dot and like it here.  So how do we live for the line?

      LJ from  Mugwhump  recently  raised the issue  about the use of the word "missionary."  She currently works in Family, Children and Youth Ministries at her church in Canada, and says, "I consider myself a missionary.  Am I wrong?"  Great question!  Let me start off by saying there is no right answer to "What is a missionary?" so no, LJ, you're not wrong.  However, we do have a few things to consider.  The word  missionary  comes from the Latin mittere, 'to send.'  The original English usage referred to someone whose role was similar to an ambassador.  The religious application of the word was recorded as early as 1656, and today is almost always used to refer to a person who is involved in full-time overseas ministry.  There are many Christians (not just missionaries) who very strongly object to the use of the term  missionary  to refer to anyone who does not meet the criteria I just stated (full-time overseas ministry).  To throw out the phrase, "Well, we're all missionaries, aren't we?" cheapens the meaning of the word, they say.  To them, a missionary is someone who has made great personal sacrifice, and as such should receive special recognition and honor within the church.  However, perhaps one motive for saying everyone is a missionary is to give them more motivation to do significant things for God, regardless of their occupation.  I feel it is unfortunate that there seems to be a hierarchy in today's Church, with full-time ministers and full-time missionaries at the top.  The emphasis is on position rather than on ministry.  What of the missionary who does nothing but computer programming, and never shares his faith with the local people around him?  What of the person in the States who works as an accountant but spends 3 nights a week witnessing to homeless people at a shelter?  Please don't think I'm downing missionaries who do "regular" jobs.  I am merely saying that  all  Christians, whether working in secular jobs or as overseas missionaries, are only as effective for Christ as they set out to be.  Going back to the hierarchy I mentioned, is it possible that some people call themselves "missionaries" because of some inferiority complex?  I think in many circles, and especially at missions conferences, we can feel guilty if we do not have a good reason to accept the "call" to overseas missions.  Do some misuse the term "missionary" to placate this guilt?  I'll close by saying that if you are offended by the inclusive use of the word  missionary , perhaps you should consider why it bothers you.  Yes, we overseas missionaries have sacrificed much to be here.  But many of us are living more ordinary lives than some of you who work 9-to-5 jobs.  So take missionaries off their pedestals, and place them right beside you in your thinking.  We're all missionaries in that we  all  have a mission to make disciples (Matt 28:16-20).  May we all press on toward that end.

       Every day you should be seeing the world in a new personal way.  The tree outside your house is no longer the same - so   look   at it.  Your husband, wife, child, mother, father all are changing daily so   look   at them.  Everything is in the process of change, including you .  -- Leo Buscaglia  This morning, I was reading   urlLink 1823301?v=glance&s=books">What Kids Need Most in a Dad   when I came to the above quote.  This current chapter is about acceptance, and the power it has to let your kids (or spouse, or friends, etc.) be themselves and like it.  As I thought of this, I asked myself:  Do I take my wife of 5 1/2 years for granted?  Sure, I think it's natural.  I think there are even times when I take my baby boy for granted.  The key, I think, is that I have to remember to step back and correct myself of this attitude from time to time (daily would be nice).  So my encouragement today - to myself as well as to whoever reads this - is to stop right now and appreciate.  Appreciate your friends...appreciate your spouse...appreciate your kids...appreciate God's creation.  As you do that, the people in your life WILL feel your acceptance.  I close with the following excerpt from the play  The Rainmaker  by N. Richard Nash.  See ya Monday...  ----- Starbuck:  ...Nothing's as pretty in your hands as it was in your head.  There ain't no world near as good as the world I got up here  (angrily tapping his forehead) .  Why?  Lizzie:  I don't know.  Maybe it's because you don't take time to see it.  Always on the go - here, there, nowhere.  Running away...keeping your own company.  Maybe if you'd keep company with the world...  Starbuck:   (doubtfully)   ...I'd learn to love it?  Lizzie:  You might - if you saw it real.  Some nights I'm in the kitchen washing the dishes.  And Pop's playing poker with the boys.  Well, I'll watch him real close.  And at first, I'll just see an ordinary middle-aged man - not very interesting to look at.  And then, minute by minute, I'll see little things I never saw in him before.  Good things and bad things - queer little habits I never noticed he had - and ways of talking I never paid any mind to.  And suddenly I know who he is - and I love him so much I could cry!  And I want to thank God I took the time to see him   real  .

      Steve from  urlLink Under the Rug  asked a  urlLink good question  in response to  urlLink my post  on what it's like raising a child in a foreign country.  As Steve points out, in the early missionary tradition, the local people were encouraged to not only adopt Christianity, but also to adopt the "more civilized" western culture.  Picture Audrey Hepburn in  The African Queen , teaching the local indigenous people how to sing western hymns in English.  Then the pendulum swung the other way, with more of a focus on meeting the people where they are, and assimilating with them.  This has reached an extreme in some circles.  For example, there are some missionaries among Muslims who think it is perfectly acceptable for a Muslim to live the "Muslim lifestyle" (praying 5 times a day, going to the mosque, basically remaining a Muslim culturally) and yet believe in Jesus and focus their worship on him.  (Maybe I'll talk about this controversial form of contextualization in a future post).  The United States is a perfect example of "the melting pot."  If person from culture X wants to pray in manner Y, go for it!  Actually, "melting pot" might be a little misleading, since the term implies unity from diversity.  I think, however, the U.S. prides itself more on its diversity.  There are other countries where the opposite is true.  In Turkey, for example, where there are millions of Kurdish people, it's illegal to speak the Kurdish language.  For people living abroad, I can't say which is "right" - to blend or be blended.  I can only answer to what we do here.  Regarding child-raising, sometimes we assimilate.  They want Junior to wear socks, he wears socks.  They want to rub oil on his stomach when he's gassy, go ahead.  I don't love it, but I can tolerate it.  However, in areas of discipline, if they say, "No, that's okay," I will say, "No, it's not.  We need to teach him it's not right to stab a person in the foot with a skewer that people let him pick up"  (not a real situation, never fear).  Or when we put him to bed and he cries for the first few minutes, our friends are in agony!  "He's crying!" they tell us.  I have yet to tackle someone trying to go into our room to "save" our crying boy, but we  have   had to assure people that he's okay, and that he might actually live.  I think the most important thing is to keep in mind, at least regarding raising a child, is that WE are the ones who are stuck with this kid year after year.  We also have to remember that just about every move we make is watched by others, so whenever we   can  follow their cultural practices, we do.  In the end, I think they'll respect us more.

      This week's Theology Thursday is in response to one of the most thrown-about sentence starters among Christians today:  "The Lord told me..."  Perhaps some people do mean this literally, but I think it's a serious statement with serious implications.  Read on...  -----  When we were raising support in the States, people often asked us to share about how we were called to missions work.  This really got me thinking, because I really didn't feel like I had a special calling.  I read the Bible, and it's pretty clear that God wants the world (all the way to the "ends of the earth") to be brought to a saving knowledge of Him.  So here I am, pretty simple.  I think the fundamental flaw in this question of a "calling" centers on a very basic element of our theology:  How does God communicate with us?  I would argue that God speaks to us primarily through His Word, the Holy Bible.  There are two kinds of revelation, as you may know.  General revelation refers to the truth God makes available about Himself to all people, everywhere, all the time.  God's creation is general revelation at work.  Who could look at mountains, oceans, animals or humans and NOT know that something very unique is behind it all?  I won't make my post any longer than it already is by quoting Ps 19:1-6, Rom 1:18-20 or Acts 14:15-17, so go check those verses out.  It's great stuff.  Special revelation, on the other hand, is transmitted not to everyone, but only to a certain person or group of people.  Special revelation has taken the form of special acts (signs and miracles), appearances (including the incarnation of Christ) and, of course, Scripture.  God spoke to various prophets (Heb 1:1-2), who wrote down what they heard.  Whoever read their words (or translations of their words) were likewise exposed to God's special revelation.  Just so I am clear:  Any prophecy revealed to someone is special revelation.  Here is the meat of my argument.  For someone to say "God told me..." or "I have a word from the Lord" implies that this person has received special revelation.  It must follow that the content of their message is on par with Scripture, since what the person has received must be considered prophecy.  Perhaps you would disagree with that statement, but the alternative is that we have varying degrees of revelation, some more valid or pertinent than others.  Either it's the Word of God or it's not!  Now if we allow that this person receives direct communication from God, we must submit them to the same test to which the prophets of old were subject.  The test of a prophet has three components:  1.  We can expect to see either a miracle or sign, which is God's way of validating the message and the messenger (John 3:2, 10:38; Acts 2:22; 2 Cor 12:12). 2.  We will see a 100% accuracy rate in the person's prophecies (Deut 18:21-22). 3.  What the person says will not contradict God's Word (Deut 13:1-5).  I do not believe that God speaks directly to individual Christians today.  If you DID hear some sort of voice in your head, how do you know it is God and not your own self talking?  How do you KNOW that the voice you're hearing is not Satan, crafting a clever argument in your head?  There is absolutely no way to discern.  Just being in accordance with God's word is not enough.  I have heard of situations in ministry where a person and his boss had two conflicting words "from the Lord."  How do you reconcile that?  Either one or both of them are lying, or one or both of them are misreading personal feelings as the voice of God.   I think I need to continue this thought next week as I work through how God DOES talk to us today.  You already know where I'm going with this, but I hope you'll come back anyway...  Next week's topic:  Ahh...So THAT'S What He Sounds Like!

       urlLink I have already shared  about what life was like here before baby, and yesterday  urlLink Jane shared  about life as a pregnant woman here.  Today I share a little bit about the cultural differences we've seen since having a baby.  The first thing we noticed was that local women here have a lot of restrictions, whether on their diet, their activities, etc.  They would be shocked to see an American out and about just a week or so after delivery, and with baby no less!  Even when it was "safe" to take him out, he (and Jane) had better have socks on!  For some reason, this was a big deal to them.  It's not like it's cold here.  In many ways, my first real culture shock experience was after we had Junior.  I felt a bit offended when people would tell me how to take care of our boy.  It was as if they thought we had no idea how to raise kids.  I felt like saying, "You know what?  Americans do it this way all the time, and yet somehow our kids survive!"  If Junior cried, they claimed, "He's hungry!"  (Never mind that he JUST ate.)  The other crying "remedy" - make a bunch of noise in his face.  Shake a rattle, clap your hands.  Grrrr....stop it!  I felt protective, like, "Leave my son alone!"  If he was sleeping, it didn't stop them from pinching his cheeks, sometimes waking him up.  I think I was probably pretty uptight those first couple months.  One funny example, which was a little unnerving at the time:  We were at a friend's house, and Junior was crying because he had gas (colic).  The wife (who is a mother of a few kids herself) took Junior, rubbed some stuff on his stomach, and then held him to her chest.  She then made this weird choking/barking sound.  When she did it again I was about to try to go for help, but then I realized she was doing this on purpose.  She was "burping," I guess to try to get Junior to burp.  She did this about 5-10 times, and I felt like I was at an exorcism or something.  One  huge  difference between the way we raise Junior and local child raising here is how we get our information.  The people here learn how to raise kids from their mother, aunt, grandmother, etc.  Jane and I learned almost everything we know from books and the internet.  The few times Jane's mother did offer some advice, it was always put up against what we already knew for validity.  I'm sure I'll share a lot more as things come to mind, but these are some of the things that remind us that the world is a bigger place than just the U.S., and that people sometimes do things very differently than we do!  The challenge for me has been to being open that maybe some things they do here they do  better  than the way we do it in the States.

       urlLink Yesterday  I talked about what life was like here before we had kids - how people viewed us and how their concept of "a good time to have kids" is different than ours.  Today's topic is what life was like when we were pregnant.  Now even though it's the touchy-feely thing to say "WE were pregnant," let's be real...Jane was the one really going through it.  Therefore, I thought I'd invite her to be a guest blogger for this post.  Take it away, Jane!  In a culture that highly values children and also a woman's role as a mother, a childless woman can feel alienated by her peers and even her own family.  For me, being pregnant - and after 6 months, noticeably pregnant - there was an almost palpable sense of respect that I had not felt before.  I even held my head a little higher, feeling I had become "one of them" in a sense because I was joining the ranks of motherhood.  And the role of a mother is one that has no cultural boundaries.  Sudddenly I was on common ground with a large percentage of the female population when before I was completely alien.  Women in shopping malls and airports would look at me approvingly and ask how many months along I was.  It changed everything for me as far as relationships and fitting into this new country.  Some people would not recommend having a child within your first year or two on the mission field - too many major life changes at once.  But for us, it was a real blessing and a way for us to interact with people on a new level.

      Today I thought I would provide a little glimpse into how we were and are viewed here, in light of our marital status and/or family status (without or with child) at the time.  Nothing too deep - just processing a little as I share.  Today I'll talk about pre-child, tomorrow about being pregnant and Wednesday about being a family with child.  We were here in country for about six months before we were even pregnant.  During that time, we were learning the national language, and were out and about a lot as we practiced our speaking (and listening) with people on the street, shopowners or public transportation people (whether cabbies, bus drivers or at the train station).  One of the first things you learn are the opening pleasantries, just like in the States when you meet someone for the first time.  One of the first things we noticed was that most people assumed we were boyfriend-girlfriend, rather than husband-wife.  Perhaps that's because a good number of the tourists who come through are backpackers, who tend to be college-aged singles (sometimes boyfriend-girlfriend).  Anyway, we quickly learned to, early on, throw in that we were married.  Sometimes people seemed surprised!  The conversation then inevitably took this turn:  Local:   So how long have you been married?  Me:   Three and a half years.  Local:   Do you have any children?   or  How many children do you have?  Me:   No  (or  None ). Local:   How long have you been married?   So we learned that whereas in the States, it's considered wise to wait a few years while you sort out your couple issues before having a baby, in this country you should be celebrating your first anniversary with a baby (or at least pregnant).  The fact that we were several years into our marriage with no kids implied to them that one of us was sterile.  I think one person even mumbled that word.  I'm not sure, since I don't know the word for it, but his friends sort of hit him and reprimanded him so I assume that's what he said.  Another byproduct of appearing to be boyfriend-girlfriend was that Jane was seen as "available," since we all know that western women are loose (because aren't they on TV?).  Even when I was with Jane, guys would not be subtle at all about staring at her.  We developed a pretty good routine whereby I would walk at a pace that would put me exactly between Jane and the guy(s), and as we passed, I slowed my pace down to keep screening her from them.  Jane rarely, if ever, went anywhere by herself.  It might have been safe, but she would have gotten comments to go along with the stares, and who wants that?

      This morning I  urlLink posted  about finding "the exact right thing" you were made for.  My point was that God wired us all with certain preferences, strengths and weaknesses.  If we are able to deal with Adam's curse by toiling in something we actually enjoy,  this is a gift of God  (Ecc 5:19).  My wife Jane found it interesting that I could believe so strongly that this is true for me, without realizing that it might be true for her as well.  Ouch.  Don't get me wrong - Jane wants to be a missionary.  "Future missionary," in fact, was one of her highest criteria when seeking a husband.  It's just that she has never really felt that this particular organization was a great fit for her - for how God wired  her .  And she gently reminded me tonight that perhaps we should have asked some more questions before we signed on 100% and left the States.  So where do we go from here?  Well, we are at least determined to finish out this term, which is another couple years or so.  I'm checking out another type of ministry within our organization, which might be a better fit for us as a couple - not just a good fit for Joe.  And who knows, maybe we will say, "You know what?  Maybe another ministry might be better for us."  That would be tough, because it would involve doing the whole orientation thing again - both in the States and wherever we ended up.  But if I want my whole family to feel fulfilled, to feel that they are using what God has given them, then I need to consider all alternatives.

      In 1996, American cyclist  urlLink Lance Armstrong  was diagnosed with testicular cancer, which rapidly spread to his lungs and brain.  His chances for survival were less than 50/50.  After surgery to remove the tumors, he began an agressive form of chemotherapy.  In 1999, Lance won the  urlLink Tour de France , the most elite cycling race in the world.  Held over a period of about 3 weeks, the Tour comprises 20 stages (this year), from flat to extremely mountainous, from team efforts to individual time trials.  Lance went on to win the next four Tours as well, becoming one of only three men to have won 5 consecutive Tours.  Today, Lance goes for #6, which no one has ever won, consecutive or not.  While he is still the favorite to win, many are also saying this will be his toughest Tour yet.  Why do I mention the Tour?  Well, as a fairly recent Lance Armstrong fan (since his 2001 Tour), I was just amazed at his complete prowess on the bike.  This guy was  made  for cycling.  Picture a steep mountain road, guys grimacing as they plod up, but Lance looks as relaxed as can be.  He is a machine.  (For classic Lance, check out  urlLink this USA Today article , or  urlLink this picture .)  I thought, Man, how often does that happen?  Someone finds the exact right thing they were made for.  Why do many of us seem not to be able to find it?  Do we place too much weight on personality inventories and aptitude tests?  Do we lock ourselves in a dark room and tell God we're not coming out unless He tells us what to do with our lives?  Do we continue on in a job just because "I've already been here 12 years, it would be a shame to quit now and lose my pension."?  Let's remember the words of Solomon, which is my prayer for you all:   Then I realized that it is good and proper for a man to eat and drink, and to find satisfaction in his toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given him - for this is his lot.  Moreover, when God gives any man wealth and possessions, and enables him to enjoy them, to accept his lot and be happy in his work - this is a gift of God.  He seldom reflects on the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with gladness of heart .  -- Ecc 5:18-20

      I probably won't link much on this blog since I don't surf a lot beyond the  other  blogs, but today I have a few for ya:  First of all, I have created a SmartFeed with FeedBurner (www.feedburner.com).  With it, you can utilize ATOM feeds or RSS.  If you're interested, the feed URL for my blog is now:   http://feeds.feedburner.com/JoeMissionary  I've also added the cute little FeedBurner icon ( urlLink   ) on my sidebar.  Thanks to  urlLink The Dawn Treader  for letting me know it existed!  -----  urlLink Under the Rug  is an up-and-coming blog I found out about from  urlLink Proverbial Wife .  Despite being written by a state government employee, it's actually good!  Steve has a dry, bitingly sarcastic sense of humor.  Right up my alley...  ----- If you're a Bible scholar or play one on TV, you probably already know about  urlLink The Biblical Studies Foundation .  Besides putting out the downloadable  urlLink NET Bible , they have a section I love called " urlLink Prof's Soapbox .".  It's a bunch of articles written by Daniel Wallace, a Greek and NT scholar.  The topics run the gamut from overviews of NT books, translation issues and problem passages to theological issues like spiritual gifts and leadership.  ----- Thanks to  urlLink Andrew  for an  urlLink interesting site  which gives a letter grade for the flag design for each country in the world.

      I have decided to start a "Theology Thursday" entry on this blog.  I hope to share a point of theology or an aspect of faith and run it past you all for your comments, and yes, criticism.  I usually gravitate towards topics that are somewhat controversial, but it's not my intention to start fights here.  So let's all play nice, 'kay?  I welcome your feedback, trusting it will help to sharpen me (Prov 27:17).  This week's topic:  "Is It Ever Okay To Lie?"  -----  If you ask 10 Christians (or professing Christians anyway) what the Bible says about lying, probably 7 would say, "Oh, that's easy.  One of the Ten Commandments says,  You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor ."  However, if we look more closely at that verse, it's pretty clear that God was talking about court.  The NIV says it this way:   You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor .  It's a legal issue, folks.  Why would one of the "Big Ten" center around someone we often consider a periphery character in the courtroom - the witness?  Well, let's remember:  Israel was a people, but not yet a nation.  Between the time they left Egypt, but before they arrived in the promised land, God developed them into a nation.  One primary way He did this was by imparting to Israel laws - both religious and civil.  The reason many people have a hard time reading the first few books of the Bible is that it's dull!  It's a bunch of legal stuff.  Do this, don't do that; if someone does [bad thing], smash [body part] with a big rock.  Stuff like that.  Okay, I made up the big rock thing.  Obviously, in a court of law, what a witness says can often free or condemn the accused.  God understood this and reminded His people via Big Law Number IX that if you accuse someone of doing something, you had better be telling the truth about it.  If you  did  pay attention while reading those first few books, you may have noticed that the death penalty was the punishment for a lot of crimes those days.  So far, I've spent a lot of time saying that the Ten Commandments does not say that lying is wrong, just that it's wrong to do so in a court of law.  Now...the Bible DOES say this:   Do not lie.  Do not deceive one another .  -- Lev 19:11  Okay, now we're getting somewhere.  Lying is bad.  Deception is bad.  So far, so good.  There's just one problem passage for me, and that is Heb 11:31:   By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient [or unbelieving] .  Now most people, maybe 10 out of 10 Christians this time, would say that Hebrews 11 is the great "Hall of Faith," full of people who are the ultimate role models.  And yet what is Rahab commended for?  For deceiving people, and nothing else.  Who knows, maybe the author of Hebrews would say, "Oh yeah, that was a sin all right.  But what faith!"  So is it  sometimes  okay to lie or deceive one another?  When someone says, "Do I look fat in these pants?" is it a sin to say, "No, you look great!" if it's clearly a lie?  If a customs official says, "What's in the box?" and you say "My complete collection of Hardy Boys books" when it's really a box full of contraband Bibles, is that a sin?  The good thing about theology is that sometimes, it's okay to say "I don't know."  I do believe that when the situation presents itself, our God who gives us all the wisdom we ask for (James 1:5) will come through for us.  And if we make the wrong choice,  He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from unrighteousness  (1 John 1:9).  Next week's topic:  Hear That?  It's the Voice of the Lord (I Think?)!

      We're getting to the point now where Junior needs occasional corrective measures. Right now the only thing that really merits discipline is touching phone jacks and electrical outlets. At first, our stern "No" worked. Junior paused, turned and walked away. But once he turned one year old, he started testing us. He looks at us with a playful grin, we tell him firmly "Don't touch," he keeps the grin on his face and touches it (while still looking at us).  At first we responded with slapping his hand, but he liked it. We smacked his hand, he started clapping. Then we grounded him and took away his telephone privileges. That, also, failed to break him. Recently, Jane was reading  urlLink  The New First Three Years of Life   by Burton White. In it, he recommends restraint as punishment. If Junior does not heed me, I should put him on my lap and hold him tightly, pinning his upper arms to his torso. This restraint seems to really, really irritate the 1- to 2-year-olds, and according to White, after a week or so, it should have done its trick. He says if it doesn't, you were letting him move too much.  So far we've tried it and yes, it bugs the heck out of Junior. Instant screaming. And we've been at it for almost a week, and MAYBE it's starting to work. There have been more times lately where he listens to our "Don't touch" so we're encouraged. But there are also still the rebellious times. We heard that this testing phase will last until around or just after he turns 2.  So parents, any tips or ideas or stories from YOUR experience with disciplining your baby?

       Today is BlogSwap day, folks, and I'm happy to introduce Rebecca Writes, who is sharing with us on the assigned topic of Freedom.  I like Rebecca's site because she likes to tackle theology, like I do.  I'm surprised that I don't already have her on my sidebar, so I'll fix that today too.  Anyway, take it away, Rebecca!   The subject for this week's BlogSwap is "freedom".  I spent most of the week choosing a topic, only finally settling on one the morning of the day the posts were due.    I shall write, I've decided, on God's freedom.  I've been doing a series of posts on my blog about God's various attributes, so it seems right that I look at the sort of freedom that God has.  (It seems so right that I'm wondering why it took a week to come up with it.)    But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.   (Psalm 115:3 NASB) This is a clear scriptural statement of God's freedom.  When we discuss human freedom, there are legitimate things to wrangle over, for no matter how you cut it, there are nuances to human freedom.  God's freedom is different, for there is no subtlety in "He does whatever He pleases."  Whatever things God wants to do, he does;  whatever actions he chooses to take are surely accomplished.  So, what sort of a God must we have, that this sort of completely unfettered freedom can be ascribed to him?  First of all, he must be a  personal  God.  He can't be just a force without personality, for the God in this statement in Psalms has desires.  He wants certain things done.  He makes decisions about what will be done, and those decisions arise from what pleases Him.  He is a thinking God, a considering God.  He is not a nameless force, but a God with names that reflect His character and his will.  Then, since whatever desires arise out of his personal character--whatever is his will--is done with certainty, there are a few other things we can know about him.  He must be  all-powerful .  He must have all the power, strength, ability that is needed to carry out everything he desires to accomplish within his creation.  He must have an unthwartable hand that can always move to do what he wants.  Along with this, he must be the only one who has this sort of unstoppable strength.  There can be no other unthwartable hands out there, because if there is a clash of desires, he must be the one whose desires are done.  He must be more powerful than any other: the most powerful, the only omnipotent.  In order to accomplish all he desires, he must also be  all-wise .  There can be no piece of information that exists, or will exist, that He is doesn't know.  If there were, there would be a possibility that this little bit of unknown, or unforseen, info might mess up his plans because he didn't take it into consideration.  He must consider everything when he decides what actions to take to accomplish what he desires.  He must know all there is to know--all possibilities, and all the consequences of those possibilites.  There can be no unintended consequences to any of his actions, or the statement from Psalm 115 that "He does whatever He pleases" isn't a right one.  A God who does what he pleases must also be the omniscient one.  I suppose by now you're wondering about the other "omni" attribute, and whether that is necessary for God to carry out all his desires.  I think so.  In order for God to be all powerful--able to accomplish whatever he wants to do--his power must reside in every space of creation.  He must be able to act in any place at any time as he wants.  Therefore, God's power, and thus God himself, must be  all-present .  A God with the freedom to do as he desires must also be the omnipresent one.  There is probably a whole lot more we can conclude from that little five word statement of God's freedom.  Right now I'm thinking of a few things it teaches us about ourselves, and about our circumstances. I'm guessing there is also a whole lot more it teaches us about our God.  There is a deadline to this assignment, though, and I'm not writing a book, either, so here's where it ends.  Well, not quite.  Apparently it's not over till the fat lady sings, so she will.  urlLink Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise  Immortal, invisible, God only wise, In light inaccessible hid from our eyes, Most bless'd, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.  Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light, Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might; Thy justice, like mountains, high soaring above Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.  To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small; In all life Thou livest, the true life of all; We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree, And wither and perish--but naught changeth Thee.  Great Father of glory, pure Father of light, Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight; But of all Thy rich graces this grace, Lord, impart Take the veil from our faces, the vile from our heart.  All laud we would render; O help us to see 'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee, And so let Thy glory, almighty, impart, Through Christ in His story, Thy Christ to the heart. --Thank you,  urlLink Walter C. Smith , for those glorious words.  What say ye? Any conclusions based on those five words that you'd like to add?  Any conclusions I drew that you'd like to niggle over?  What does God's freedom mean to you?    urlLink Rebecca Writes  about whatever interests her, which means you can be absolutely certain that her blog will be a politics, purpose driven, and emerging church free zone.      It's Joe again.  If you want to read my entry on Freedom, it will be posted on  urlLink Simple Games .  To view the rest of this week's entries,  urlLink click here .  Would you like to BlogSwap?

      Have you ever wondered why, when someone talks about an "answered prayer," that it always is something that turned out positively for the person speaking?  It seems to me that this way of thinking comes from plain old bad doctrine.  It comes from the attitude that God is our Santa Claus, our heavenly Sugar Daddy, who wants to give us all sorts of things, but we just don't ask.  When we ask, BOOM!  He answers.  I know, I know - "You do not have because you do not ask God" (Jas 4:2) and "Ask and it will be given to you" (Mat 7:7) and "I will do whatever you ask in my name" (John 14:13).  But is this what prayer is all about?  Obviously, it's not.  There are plenty of examples in the Bible where God "didn't come through" for His saints.  Consider these verses:   The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised .  - Job 1:21  David pleaded with God for the child...On the seventh day the child died...The David got up from the ground...went into the house of the Lord and worshiped .  - 2 Sam 15-23  Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done .  - Luke 22:42  We see in these verses an underlying posture of submission to the will of God.  When we ask of God, we must have that same posture.  Those who tell you to boldly claim things from God are misled.  You cannot hold a gun to God's head, saying, "It's in your Word, God, so I'm holding you to this promise and claim it for my life!"  That sounds good, but by doing this we have forgotten that we're talking to someone who loves us and already wants the best for us!  So here's how it works:  We ask, and God answers.  ALWAYS.  And you know what?  Often, that answer is "No."  Further, God's "No" is always with purpose.  So in my opinion, we need to take the focus off of what kind of answer God gives our prayers.  When he answers "Yes," I think we should rejoice in His grace.  When he answers "No," we should be equally as vocal to others about God's continued sovereignty over our lives, trusting that He knows what He's doing.

      Be sure to tune in tomorrow for Theology Thursday.  The topic is "God Doesn't NOT Answer Prayer," and addresses the whole concept of "answered prayers."   Then on Friday is another BlogSwap.  For those who don't know or didn't pick up on it a couple weeks ago, BlogSwap is a "blogger exchange" program, through which one's blog entry is posted on someone else's blog.  So last time, my blog entry, "  urlLink How To Pray For Missionaries  ," was hosted by   urlLink Challies.com   (who is the organizer of BlogSwap), while I hosted an entry from   urlLink Spy Journal  .  If you're interested in participating in BlogSwap, go to  urlLink  Challies.com   and get in touch with Tim.  Sometimes, BlogSwap participants are given a topic on which to blog.  This Friday's topic is "Freedom."  I hope you'll come back on Friday to read the guest blogger's entry (I don't know who it will be yet), and that you'll go to read my entry as well.  I will be discussing free will in particular.  I may recycle it into a Theology Thursday post on Joe Missionary in the future, in case I've had a crazy week and couldn't do a fresh post.  I hope to host the Christian Carnival at some point in the near future, but right now I really have to buckle down on my university studies.  I think the Christian Carnival is a great thing, and even though it would put me way over my 30 minutes' of internet time for one or two days, I'd like to pitch in and help carry the hosting load.  At least once.

      What a weird phenomenon.  I meet a complete stranger, and despite the fact that he might be somewhat of a jerk, I'm polite and pleasant around him.  Then my wife, whom I love more than anybody on this earth, says something that slightly annoys me and I respond harshly.  Or sometimes when I'm in the middle of telling Jane something, if someone taps her on the shoulder or starts to say something, a switch goes off and so does her attention toward me.  As if I was never there.  Why is this?  I think it's a simple matter of taking our spouses for granted.  Subconsciously, when I do this to Jane I must say to myself, "She knows how much I love her, so it doesn't matter if I don't respond in the most loving way."  I was reminded of this when reading   urlLink The Power of a Praying Husband   by Stormie Omartian.  Check out this quote from her:  " Do you ever talk to your wife in a way that would be considered rude if you were speaking to a friend or business associate?...Your wife was created as a gift from God to complete you (1 Cor 11:9).  But she must be treated as the gift from God that she is, in order for that complete blessing to happen in your life.  Your wife will prove to be your greatest asset if you value and honor her ."  It seems to be a cultural thing for husbands and wives to publicly (and jokingly) complain about the other, or even about being married.  The joking, though, carries an damaging undercurrent.  May I always honor Jane with my words, in my tone of voice and in my treatment of her in general.   Especially  in public.

       There seem to be different philosophies on what blogs appear in a blogger's sidebar. Some link to blogs that they actually read, others link to anyone who links THEM and still others have no real philosophy at all. Now that I've gotten to the point where other people are actually linking to me and I feel that pressure to reciprocate, I thought I'd just go public with my [current] sidebar philosophy.   The blogs on my sidebar represent all of the blogs that I could read any given day. I never read them all; in fact, since I limit myself to 30 minutes online a day, I usually get to read a handful or two (depending on if I comment or not). How do new blogs get on my sidebar? Well, if someone links to me and has a blog, I always check it out. If it's a good read, I'll add it. If I find I have gone a couple weeks and haven't read it at all, I delete it. If you had your blog on my sidebar, and then it's gone, don't be offended! Arguably one of the best Christians blogs out there is  urlLink  Jollyblogger  , but let's be real - David's posts are way too meaty for me to digest and still have time left from my 30 minutes of internet time! So being dropped says nothing of the quality of the blog.   So I'm curious - what's YOUR "sidebar philosophy?" What is your criteria for adding and dropping bloggers? Does it even matter???

      After the conference I attended last week, Jane and I had a personal retreat at a pretty nice hotel here. We had a retreat in January, and decided to make it a biannual event. Our retreat was made up of:  1. A time of praise for how God has worked the past six months 2. Addressing areas we would like to work on in the next six months (including any unresolved issues since the last retreat) 3. Time alone with God to sort out and come up with a tentative plan in these areas 4. A dedication time of prayer  I am very thankful for the changes which God has effected in my life since February. Actually, that's an understatement. I have undergone one of the greatest changes in my life. Six months ago, I was an internet addict - stuck in front of the computer for much of the day, every day. I was lost in this cyber reality because I couldn't handle the real one - a reality of ambiguity, work for which I felt ill-equipped and the added family responsibility of parenthood. My addiction inevitably led to visiting pornographic websites, which led to Jane finding out. That day - February 2 - was the turning point. From that day on, I have taken back the responsibility I had so long neglected - responsibility toward Jane and Junior, responsibility toward my university studies here and responsibility toward the people who support us generously with money and prayer.  Funny, an internet addict and what does he do for therapy? He blogs. Actually folks, I limit myself to 30 minutes of internet time a day. That doesn't count writing my blog entries, which is done offline. I find that having a time limit really helps me to be deliberate in my surfing. No more, "Hmmm...what else can I do while I'm connected?" I get on with a purpose and don't dilly-dally. To be honest, since I've started blogging I spend about 25 of my 30 minutes reading other blogs! I don't think that's a bad use of time, considering the quality of some of the blogs you see on my sidebar.  So what am I going to work on in the next six months? Well, I want to keep my quiet times going strong, which means having a plan for what I'll study once I'm done with the few books I'm going through now. I want to consider how I can be a great husband and father, taking the initiative and always striving to be honest and open before Jane and Junior. I want to enter into one more accountability relationship, since the one I am currently in is not 100% regular. And I want to keep blogging, because it's a good way for me to regularly process this life God's given me.

      If you haven't already, check out  urlLink  yesterday's post   before reading on...  Now what about those crowns?  Well, crowns represent authority and power.  There are five crowns mentioned in the Bible, though I agree with Alcorn that this list is likely not exhaustive.  Could one of these crowns be yours?  1.  The Crown of Life - given to those who persevere under persecution (Jas 1:12; Rev 2:10) 2.  The Incorruptible Crown - given to those who are deliberate and steadfast in living the Christian life (1 Cor 9:24-25) 3.  The Crown of Joy - (1 Thes 2:19; Phil 4:1) - I disagree with Alcorn that this is a heavenly reward; the contexts here indicate that this crown is like a "badge of honor" that represents Paul's feelings toward these believers. 4.  The Crown of Glory - given for being responsible and faithful leaders in the Church (1 Pet 5:1-4) 5.  The Crown of Righteousness - given for a life lived fully for Christ (2 Tim 4:6-8)  Yes, we will lay our crowns at Jesus' feet, as Rev 4:10 tells us.  The image in my mind, and maybe yours, is that the second we receive our rewards, we toss them like frisbees at the feet of Jesus.  Do you really think you won't care about your reward?  How can your crowns bring honor and glory to Jesus if you toss them like you never really cared about them in the first place?  The Bible seems to think they're pretty special things to try for.  Further, regarding our crowns or future rewards, Scripture tells us that it's possible to lose them (Rev 3:11), have them taken from us (Mat 25:28) or even be disqualified from receiving them (1 Cor 9:27).  2 John 8 warns us,  Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.   I close by saying that I think we SHOULD be trying for rewards.  By doing good works, by being Christlike, by enduring and persevering, we are storing up for ourselves treasures in heaven.  We all want to hear the words, "Well done," which implies we have done things well (not just prayed, or believed).  There's nothing wrong with God motivating us with the promise of rewards, just as parents reward their children for a job well done.  This is the ultimate in delayed gratification; working for rewards that are mostly unimaginable.  Consider the words of C.S. Lewis from The Weight of Glory:      Indeed, if we consider the unblushing promises of rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak.  We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy has been offered to us.  We are far too easily pleased, like an ignorant child who goes on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by an offer of a holiday at the sea.     Thanks for bearing with me as I continue thinking about and working through this topic, and as always, I appreciate your comments and opinions.

      Today's topic is an interesting one for me, as it covers something I had never really considered before. Since I have been a Christian for about 15 years, went to seminary for a year and yet have never considered this topic, I think it's likely that many of you have not considered it either. The topic? Our heavenly rewards. After having completed this entry, I've decided to break it up into two parts, due to its length. So come back tomorrow for the conclusion, kay?  It seems that the general attitude of Christians regarding their rewards is ambivalence. " It doesn't matter what rewards I ge, cuz I'm just gonna throw all my crowns at the feet of Jesus! " It's like God's giving us rewards, but since they go instantly into the big Jesus pile, so who cares how many we actually get, right? Well, let's look at what the Bible has to say. Hat tip to Randy Alcorn for doing most of the leg work for this post in his book    urlLink Money, Possessions and Eternity   .  Those of us who are Christians know that  man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment  (Heb 9:27). This judgment will be carried out upon all humans past and present. The doctrine of this final judgment is also present in the Apostle's Creed (A.D. 250), the Nicene Creed (A.D. 325) and the Athanasian Creed (A.D. 400). Those who are true believers will pass this judgment and enter heaven, while unbelievers will fail and be sent to hell. By the way, I'll cover heaven and hell in a future Theology Thursday.  But Christians, it doesn't end there. The Scriptures tell us of a second judgment just for you and me. This time, Christ will judge us on the basis of our works. That's right, our works; those non-salvific things that we're not supposed to focus on because we're saved by grace, through faith. There are plenty of Scriptures that affirm this second judgment - check it out:   OLD TESTAMENT:   Will he not repay each person according to what he has done?  - Prov 24:12  For God will bring every deed into judgment...whether it is good or evil.  - Ecc 12:14  NEW TESTAMENT:   ...his work will be shown for what it is...the fire will test the quality of each man's work...  - 1 Cor 3:12-15  For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.  - 2 Cor 5:10  ...I will repay each of you according to your deeds.  - Rev 2:23  Scripture tells us that Christ will reward us for doing good things, for denying ourselves, for taking care of the poor, for kindness toward our enemies, for giving generously and for enduring trials and persecution, among other things. While we all will reign with Christ (Rev 20:6), not all of us will yield the same authority. I believe that the parables of the talents (Mat 25:21-23) and the minas (Luke 19:17-24) shows that our future authority (or lack thereof) will be based on our present stewardship.  Tomorrow, I'll get to those "heavenly frisbees."
