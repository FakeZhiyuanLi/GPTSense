      Well...let's see  I'm in State College with my mom this week to help her with her marketing assignments.  I've wanted to come here for a while so I can go visit people from belleville because I've been away for too long.  I got two of them to come up here (with a little trouble, nice driving ladies!) and we went to see Anchorman.  I enjoyed it because it had Will Ferrel in it but I don't think they had the best of times...Hey, if you wanted to see another film you should've said something... Well, any way I had a good time and I really wasn't sure if i would... It's hard facing someone you've crushed on from years before.  I'm really glad I didn't feel any residual weirdness.       I can't believe Geoff is gone!!! I'm so sad...  Why couldn't we send Pancho to Louisville instead?!! Well, 2 years may not be all that long after all....  Still doesn't make it easy     I hate weddings....well, er, particularly wedding showers that happen to fall on the same date as a LAN party that I really want to attend!!!  Why must the world try to destroy me?     I'm going to put the dreaded post back up and complete it, hopefully, some day... Mainly because I don't want it to be a mark on me...  I know this doesn't mean much to any of you but I'm ok with that.    Anyway, that's all for now  Stephen    //P.S. for you bastards who don't appreciate my blog....Go find a pencil. Sharpen it.   //Insert into Eye Socket.  Repeat steps 2 and 3.  Preheat oven to 350Â° and bake for 16 minutes.

      I would like to make amends for the damages I have caused...  I'm very sorry I made you feel like it was all your fault.  Don't let it get to you because it really wasn't.  I misread everything so I made the wrong conclusions.  Thanks for not slapping me in the face with it :).  I'll be ok, I just want the best for you.

      ok, I'll keep it short and sweet tonight...      Nothing new in the tech corner... just a bit of sucking at UT at the lan right now!     I need more dewage!    All right...so I come up today at around 3 and Geoff (a.k.a. Master Biatch) leaves for Rochester at some playboy convention... Anyway, Bob and I installed the wired network at Geoff's  when he wasn't home!   WE ARE the NETWORK MAC DADDYS!!     Anyway... I hope  everyone  is here tomorrow just so we can game like the mass-ass gamers that we truly are!  I love my computer  //Stephen //REM's are the best!

      Ok, so once again I lure you into my crappy blog with the false hope that the subject matter will somehow live up to the enticing title only to leave you with a feeling of "hitting the spot, but not quite gettin 'er there"! I apologize for the, no doubt, sleepless nights spent pondering this blog... Back to business   First things first: In the Tech Corner....     (these are the said Epiphanies)...     I have solved all of the wireless networking issues and soon will be installing the wired and wireless network at geoff's house tomorrow...That is if all things go well!     I rebuilt two of my uncle's computers and got them running while cleaning the drive of a friend who will soon be needing her files...     Other than that I've been shopping for new power supplies for two unlucky souls and some  Pimped  out cooling equipment for my already monstrous rig!  urlLink Here!  It's near the bottom (and the only one with 7 case fans...and a pic!!!)   In the rest of my life....    I'm finally coming out of the hard part of my recovery from the wisdom teeth-ectomy and can begin my solid food diet once more!  I even dared to eat pizza the other day!!! ( I know I'm just such a dare devil)     With no more pain meds keeping my head in the sky and my reflexes God knows where, I can play the guitar with my moderate talent again!  Today's picks were Moe., RCHP, and Weezer.       I was also so inclined to finally install a phone line in my room...Yes, people, I know it's amazing that a state-of-the-art-not-quite-turn-of-the-century-patchwork-parsonage doesn't have grounded outlets and phone connections in each room but it is true!     Consequently, I found my drill! :)     Well folks, I've had enough of me for one night...er..um..morning at any rate,, Good night and sweet cuppin' cakes //Stephen  //Needs more REM statements //See me after class Mr. Heagy!

      Ok, OK I just made the title a little provockative so people would actually read my personal blog... Today I had my wisdom teeth removed and I think my  drugs are a little weak.  As far as random things of the day go  here .   Still no luck with the wireless networking as of yet...it's quite perplexing I actually think there is a good chance the unit isn't working.   Ok...now that we're all asleep.  urlLink  Check this out!   I kinda feel bad about skipping out on the parade yesterday...but that's over so I can resume not caring. ;)  I'm tired again and i really wonder how much longer I can keep this blog alive...please someone e-mail or post a message to give me something to talk about!  Well I'm glad I'm on your list of random people to trust....but what makes me so weird?  Questions to be answered next week  -Stephen

      Well, tomorrow I'm going under for wisdom teeth removal...  I'm currently tacklin the riggors of configuring Geoff's new WLAN. Yay! I get to learn more about wireless networking... *Note to all computer users... Do not blow up your ATX connector if you want your computer to work!*  -Ok so that's the end of the tech of today...other than that I don't know what's going though my mind.  Alrighty...Just take my word for it! http://www.galactic-conquest.net/  more to come

      Alrighty... Well, for those of you who know (and will probably give me no end to the picking) me and what I'm about, you probably know that this blog will not be updated well nor cared for very much.    Anyway... I'm a gamer, first and foremost...secondly comes non-gaming related computer stuff...then probably skiing....guitar....white water rafting...and the list goes on...  I'm random and head-trippy at times...  I use the (...) a lot!  ...  The bottom line about me is that I love to fix things.  If I'm not working toward fixing something, be it a computer or a person, I'm not really happy.     I'll talk about me for maybe 2 more posts then I'll get into my thoughts and feelings....that is if I have the dedication to keep this up and while the gay-whitesville ping pong nutsack lovers don't bother me about it.   Three words that come to mind when i think of myself (damnit I can already tell this is getting stupid!)  1. Stubborndumbasspainintheass 2. Ladykiller 3. Passionate  if you disagree with those choices.. you can either post a reply to my suckmynuts blog or you can eat me... either way I don't care    Hold it, control it, and BUTTONS! C'mon let's see ya scroll it!   -Steve
