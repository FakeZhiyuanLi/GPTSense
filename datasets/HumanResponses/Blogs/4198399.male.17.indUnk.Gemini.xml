      I'm not afraid of fear, I'm afraid of frightening things I'm afraid to go to sleep at night, To see Death on swift wings. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Have you ever had a nightmare that woke you from your slumber? Do they come to you at once, traveling in great numbers?  Every night I have horrible, horrible nightmares. And I only call them nightmares because I don't know of a stronger word.  Some are short, some are long, but I always have them. Which isn't to say that I don't have good dreams too, because I do. Very good dreams, the kind that leave you smiling when you wake up. But these "nightmares" are responsible for the most horrible images and feelings that I have in my head. They seem more real at the time than any movie I have ever seen, and at the same time, I'm hardly ever in them. I think peoples' nightmares are made up of combinations of their day-to-day lives and their fears, and mine are no different. I wake up almost every night on the verge of tears because I have just been shown my worst fears played out in several different scenarios. As if it isn't bad enough that I have to see it right in front of me, I have to see it more than once. I haven't had a dream in years where I was in any danger, but each night I have these "terrors" I wake up in a cold sweat, so tense I can't move, every hair on my body feels like it's standing on edge, and my heart is beating so fast the energizer bunny couldn't keep up. I've tried the no salty food before bed thing, the thinking only happy thoughts before bed thing, and every other "remedy" I can think of. If you know anything that works for you that might work for me...(sorta how people trade ways to get rid of the hicups)...for the love of God, please lemme know.  Writing this is actually one "remedy" that I got and I really hope works, so cross your fingers!!!

      The sea is rocking, while land stands still, I'll live them both, 'till i've had my fill. And on that day, when I look to the sky I'll spread my arms,  and watch my soul pass by. To be together,  in another place, where  time  is standing still. To be in love, and saving grace, on our own eternal hill. To be so close,  and not afraid, is not a myth; a blind charade. Let's live the moment, with no plans made, Until ourselves into the future fade.

      The tears that came She cried for me, my pain, I thought she couldn't see. To live for Him, to die for her, I'd do all this to be  the cure. To live and die, for a single goal, isn't worth an empty soul. But she is different, somehow more she's changed me, from what I was before.

      Have you ever wondered why the sleeper pajamas with the feet are only for kids? Have you ever noticed that the most stupid people travel in groups of three or more? Have you ever wanted to beat the cr** out of the dancing pizza at Papa John's? Have you ever wondered why the Hokie Pokie is called the "Hokie Pokie"? Have you ever eaten anything that fell out of the back of a Hazmat truck? Have you ever tried to jump off of a swivel chair? Have you ever tried it a second time because you thought the first time was a fluke? Have you ever gotten free balogna from the guy at the deli? Have you ever *69'd a telemarketer? Have you ever forged your own signature? Yes, it can be done. Have you ever double-dutched to the song "All by Myself" by Celine Dion? Have you ever forgotten to put your underwear on the inside? Have you ever had a rotten tomatoe fight?

      I wrote this many years ago, but I just dug it out and read it again and wanted to share it. I've tweaked it a little bit so it's not the exactly the original. Tell me what you think 'cuz I think it's different from the norm.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No longer do I use my silence to keep the chaotic world out, but the sanity in. I feel if I utter one word, it might somehow suck the rest right out of me. Beauty is said to be in the eyes of the beholder, but the truth is that there is no beholder. Only the feeling that someone is lurking in the shadows. I am that person in the shadows. The darkness is my prison, where I am kept from the rest of the world, the light, the freedom, for what? But I see two lights, the first is a visitor, one who talks to my soul. The second, the hope that the future will be brighter than the present. And if not for these two things, and my silence, I would have lost my sanity long before this day. The visitor of light brings me salvation in such delicate portions and lingers until it is driven away by my prison, but it always insists on being near. Although I am only being kept mentally by dark walls, it makes me stronger in the mind, forcing me to strive for something better. One of these days I will find what has always been with me... The key to my prison. I will break out of these walls to show that all light comes from within the darkness. With my new-found freedom, I will take the visitor of light and together we will show the world infinities boundries that were once my own. And finally, out of the darkness, I will be the beholder and she will be the beauty.
